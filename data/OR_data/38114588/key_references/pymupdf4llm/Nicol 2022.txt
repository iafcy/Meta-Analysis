### Abstract

**Background:** Symptoms of depression and anxiety, suicidal ideation, and self-harm have escalated among adolescents to crisis
levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, primary care providers (PCPs) are often called on to provide first-line care
for these youth. Digital health interventions can extend mental health specialty care, but few are evidence based. We evaluated
the feasibility of delivering an evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) app with an embedded conversational agent to deliver
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to symptomatic adolescents presenting in primary care settings during the pandemic.
**Objective:** In this 12-week pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility of delivering the app-based intervention to adolescents aged
13 to 17 years with moderate depressive symptoms who were treated in a practice-based research network (PBRN) of academically
affiliated primary care clinics. We also obtained preliminary estimates of app acceptability, effectiveness, and usability.
**Methods:** This small, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated depressive symptom severity in adolescents randomized
to the app or to a wait list control condition. The primary end point was depression severity at 4-weeks, measured by the 9-item
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Data on acceptability, feasibility, and usability were collected from adolescents and their
parent or legal guardian. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 PCPs from 11 PBRN clinics to identify facilitators and
barriers to incorporating mental health apps in treatment planning for adolescents with depression and anxiety.
**Results:** The pilot randomized 18 participants to the app (n=10, 56%) or to a wait list control condition (n=8, 44%); 17 participants
were included in the analysis, and 1 became ineligible upon chart review due to lack of eligibility based on documented diagnosis.
The overall sample was predominantly female (15/17, 88%), White (15/17, 88%), and privately insured (15/17, 88%). Mean
PHQ-9 scores at 4 weeks decreased by 3.3 points in the active treatment group (representing a shift in mean depression score
from moderate to mild symptom severity categories) and 2 points in the wait list control group (no shift in symptom severity
category). Teen- and parent-reported usability, feasibility, and acceptability of the app was high. PCPs reported preference for
introducing mHealth interventions like the one in this study early in the course of care for individuals presenting with mild or
moderate symptoms.
**Conclusions:** In this small study, we demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety of using a CBT-based
chatbot for adolescents presenting with moderate depressive symptoms in a network of PBRN-based primary care clinics. This
pilot study could not establish effectiveness, but our results suggest that further study in a larger pediatric population is warranted.
Future study inclusive of rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and underrepresented communities is needed to establish
generalizability of effectiveness and identify implementation-related adaptations needed to promote broader uptake in pediatric
primary care.

### Introduction

Depression and anxiety are common in adolescents. [1,2]. If
left untreated, these common illnesses can result in significant
sequelae including school dropout, substance abuse, and suicide

[3]. At any one time, 18% of adolescents report depressive
symptoms [1,2], and about 3% are diagnosed with a depressive
disorder [2]. Depression and anxiety often co-occur; 1 in 3 teens
will experience clinically significant anxiety symptoms [4].
These numbers have risen in recent years due to the isolating
effects of quarantine and the stress of virtual learning during
the COVID-19 pandemic [5,6]. Even before the pandemic,
suicide was the second highest cause of death in this age group

[7-9], but in 2020, emergency department (ED) visits for
suspected suicide attempts increased by 30% compared to 2019

[10]. The effects of the pandemic on mental health in general
has been unprecedented; prepandemic mental health workforce
shortages have become more dire. Thus, there is an urgent need
to provide prompt, effective treatments that can be readily
integrated into the day-to-day lives of adolescents and
disseminated remotely during periods of quarantine and ongoing
workforce issues.

Evidence-based treatments for pediatric depression and anxiety
include selective serotonin and serotonin-norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, SNRI) medications and cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT), used separately or in combination

[11-13]. Yet, few teens receive treatment with these therapies

[13]. CBT is typically provided through a series of face-to-face
interactions with a trained therapist over several months and is
often preferred by families over medication [3,14]. However,
CBT is seldom used due to pervasive and persistent problems
with access, cost, and stigma [15-18]. Internet and mobile health
(mHealth) interventions reduce these barriers to utilization and
are acceptable and effective alternatives to live CBT for the
treatment of depression and anxiety in adults [19].
Conversational agents or “chatbots” that deliver CBT via a
text-based, semiautomated algorithm are known to reduce
mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms in nonclinical
populations [17,20-23]. However, few have been evaluated in
clinical populations, with scarce rigorous study in youth

[21,24,25].

About 95% of teens in the United States use smartphones [26]
or other web-enabled mobile devices, and nearly half report
being online almost constantly. Over half of US teens use their
devices for accessing social media platforms, and this number
may be higher in adolescents with known mental health
diagnoses [27]. Although internet use—social media use in
particular—has known serious negative effects on adolescent


mental health [28], mobile technology can also promote social
support and even assistance to young people dealing with
emotional challenges [29]. Adolescents are increasingly using
their devices to search the internet for information about mental
health [18]. Many teens want to be self-reliant when coping
with emotional distress and prefer to manage difficult situations
virtually rather than through in-person interactions [18].
However, few digital therapeutic interventions have been
specifically developed for children and adolescents [26]. Using
mHealth to deliver CBT to teens merits further evaluation, as
it is inexpensive, easy to access and administer, and scalable,
which are important attributes for widespread dissemination,
adoption, and public health impact [30].

Because the management of adolescents with depression and
anxiety is often done by primary care providers (PCPs), the goal
of this study was to investigate the feasibility of implementing
an existing mHealth intervention [20,31] as part of the treatment
plan for adolescents diagnosed with depression and anxiety by
their PCP. The intervention, Woebot for Adolesent Depression,
or W-GenZ, is an mHealth application that uses a relational
conversational agent known as Woebot to deliver CBT to
adolescents presenting with mood and anxiety concerns.
W-GenZ is one among a suite of emotional support
Woebot-based applications that have been previously studied.
Previous research demonstrated Woebot’s feasiblity and
acceptability as well as efficacy to reduce (1) depression and
anxiety among young adults [20], (2) depression among
postpartum women [32,33], and (3) substance abuse among
adults [34,35]. In addition, data indicate that Woebot establishes
a therapeutic working alliance with users [33]. The W-GenZ
app was developed specifically for use in adolescents, and while
preliminary effectiveness data among this population are
promising [36], it has not yet been rigorously tested for
effectiveness. Moreover, the application has not yet been
implemented in real-world clinical settings, where such
interventions would ideally track and report progress to PCPs
and parents, which is critical for maintaining safety and
treatment adherence.

In this open-label, randomized pilot study, our objectives were
2-fold: (1) to establish that the app is usable, acceptable, and
likely to provide benefit for adolescents, and (2) to determine
the optimal way to integrate mHealth interventions such as the
app into primary care management of adolescent depression.
This study focused on adolescents newly diagnosed with
depression and anxiety, as we anticipated immediate benefit
from using the app while awaiting a therapeutic response from
usual care, including antidepressant medication and/or referral
for psychotherapy. We hypothesized that the app would be


-----

acceptable and easy to use and that use of the app [16] would
lead to greater improvement in symptoms for adolescents newly
diagnosed with depression and anxiety compared to the wait
list control group.

### Methods

##### Methodology

Study activities were conducted within the Washington
University Pediatric and Adolescent Ambulatory Research
Consortium (WU PAARC), part of the WU Institute for Clinical
and Translational Science (ICTS). The practice network includes
over 100 pediatric care providers from approximately 60
practices in the greater metropolitan St Louis area and serves
approximately 175,000 patients. Across the consortium, 25%
(approximately 44,000) of the patients are publicly insured (eg,
Medicaid) and 28% (approximately 50,000) are Black.
Participation was restricted to patients and PCPs from 11
practices from the practice-based research network (PBRN)
who had completed a 12-month quality improvement (QI)
initiative targeted at improving care for adolescents with
depression [37], specifically by establishing systems of care
that follow the current national guidelines [12,13]. Study
activities included a small pilot randomized trial to gather data
from teens and their parent and semistructured interviews with
PCPs. The study was conducted from October 2020 to April
2021, encompassing the second wave of COVID-19 infections
in the region, which limited or at times completely shut down
in-person clinical care delivery during the study period.

##### Ethics Approval

The study was approved by the Washington University
Institutional Review Board (202005103). Parents or legal
guardians provided informed consent, and adolescents provided
informed assent to participate in the study. The consent/assent
process was initiated by phone due to pandemic-related barriers
to in-person participation. Formal consent/assent was conducted
using a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)–based
electronic consent form. Following a prescreening phone call,
the parents or legal guardians of potential adolescent participants
received an email with a unique link to review the informed
consent form online. After the research team explained the study
and answered any questions, parents or legal guardians and
potential participants clicked an “agree” button, which was
accompanied by text indicating that by clicking the button, they
were providing consent/assent to participate. They were then
asked to type their full name, which served as their electronic
signature confirming consent/assent. Upon completion of the
form, participants were presented with the option to download
an electronic copy of the executed form. A digital copy was
also emailed to each participant’s parent or legal guardian.
Participating parents or guardians and adolescents each received
up to US $40 as reimbursement for their time to complete study
assessments ($5 to $10 per survey).

##### Randomized Pilot Study

Participants were randomized 1:1 for 12 weeks either to a wait
list control or to the app intervention. Time points for clinical
assessments were based on clinical care guidelines (baseline,


4, 8, and 12 weeks) [13], with the primary analysis at 4 weeks.
The primary outcome was depression symptom severity on the
9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Secondary
outcomes included anxiety symptom severity assessed with the
7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7),
which uses scoring similar to the PHQ-9 to indicate the
frequency and severity of anxiety symptoms, and mental health
self-efficacy assessed with the Mental Health Self-Efficacy
Scale (MHSES). All patients in the intervention and wait list
control groups received usual care for their depression and
anxiety from their PCP. Participants in the control group were
offered use of the app at the end of the 12-week study period.

##### Intervention

W-GenZ delivers evidence-based therapeutic elements via brief
“conversations” with a fully automated, relational conversational
agent named Woebot. Powered by natural language processing
and machine learning techniques, the brief, self-guided
intervention draws from CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy for
adolescents (IPT-A), and some elements of dialectical behavior
therapy (DBT), tailoring the conversation to the present situation
to help the adolescent develop emotion regulation skills in the
context of their everyday life for the problem at hand. The user
experience is centered around mood tracking and goal-oriented,
tailored conversations. Woebot checks in with the user, and
depending on the user’s reported mood or desire to work on a
problem or learn something new, Woebot will offer and guide
the user through CBT-based psychoeducation and tools, tailored
to the reported need in that moment. Daily push notifications
prompt users to check in. Using proprietary neurolinguistic
programing and artificial intelligence, the platform designs a
personalized program to meet the user’s needs in real time. The
app conforms with safety recommendations from the American
Psychiatric Association (APA) and American Medical
Association (AMA) [38,39]. As part of the app’s onboarding
process, users are provided with the privacy policy, theoretical
underpinning, targeted difficulties, expected results, research
findings, and other information requested by potential young
users [18]. Safety features include informing the user they are
talking to a robot and not a real person, reminding them that
the app is not a crisis intervention for suicidal ideation,
encouraging them to seek additional support if they are feeling
unwell, and providing helplines for assistance. The safety net
protocol detects concerning language, confirms it with the user,
and provides a local suicide crisis hotline number as needed.

##### Study Population

Adolescents were eligible for inclusion if they were 13 to 17
years old and had a new diagnosis of depression and anxiety in
the past 3 months, as reported by their parent or legal guardian.
Adolescents were excluded if their parent reported any lifetime
history of severe depression, substance use disorder, psychotic
illness, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress
disorder, panic disorder, or specific phobias, as this could
indicate that the current reported episode was a more
complicated or severe presentation of depression or that the
current episode was recurrent. Those who reported a psychiatric
hospitalization in the previous month, were not accompanied
by a guardian to the diagnostic visit, did not have access to a


-----

JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH Nicol et al


mobile device (cell phone/tablet) for regular use, and were
unable to read and write English were excluded.

##### Recruitment Procedures

Five of the 11 eligible practices referred patients to the
randomized controlled trial (RCT). Potential participants were
informed about the study via a flyer distributed by their PCP at
the diagnostic visit or within the first 3 months after diagnosis.
For those interested in participation, the parent completed the
online eligibility screen. If the adolescent was eligible, the parent
and adolescent reviewed the electronic consent document and
had a telephone conversation with a member of the study team
to review participation requirements and answer questions.


If the family decided to participate, the adolescent and 1 parent
signed the electronic consent and completed baseline web-based
surveys via REDCap. Subsequently, the adolescent was
randomized using REDCap [40]. Those randomized to the
intervention received a link and a unique password to download
the intervention app on their mobile device, proceed through
the enrollment screens, and initiate the program. All participants
were followed for 12 weeks with assessments, as indicated in
Figure 1. After data collection was completed, participants’
medical charts were reviewed to confirm any additional mental
health diagnoses and record their initial treatment plan.

Questionnaire; SUS: System Usability Scale.


##### Measurement

In both study groups, study surveys were administered to
adolescents and parents through a secure digital link to a
REDCap survey. For each survey, participants were directed to
a URL via email or text, with up to 2 push notification
reminders. Time points for the primary (4 weeks) and safety (2
and 4 weeks) outcomes were selected based on the practice
guidelines for PCPs managing adolescent depression [13]. If
the measurement was not completed within 1 week, participants
received a phone call from a study team member to assess study
engagement. The surveys varied in duration and took 5 to 20
minutes to complete. Gift cards were provided to compensate
participants for their time to complete data collection and were
distributed immediately upon survey completion (up to US $40).
Study design and assessments are indicated in Figure 1.

Depression symptoms were assessed using the PHQ-9 [41]
modified for use in adolescents (PHQ-A) [42]. The PHQ-A also
consists of 9 questions, but with wording changes to


accommodate an adolescent reading level, and was used to
screen for adolescent depression according to Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-5)
criteria. Although the unmodified version has good validity and
reliability in adolescent populations, the PHQ-A has modified
the wording of the questions so that it can be entirely
self-administered in individuals with a grade 6 reading level.
The overall PHQ-9 score ranges from 0 to 27, with individual
item symptom severity scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, which correspond
to “not at all,” “several days,” “more than half the days,” and
“nearly every day,” respectively. Overall cumulative scores of
5, 10, 15, and 20 represent cut points for mild, moderate,
moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively.

Anxiety symptoms were assessed using GAD-7 [43]. This is a
reliable, valid, and responsive screening instrument commonly
used in primary care settings [44] and has been extensively
studied and validated in diverse adolescent populations,
including for screening in primary care settings in Finland [45],


-----

JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH Nicol et al


China [46], Korea [47], Ghana [48], and Canada [49]. GAD-7
has also been validated in the United States in a clinical
population of adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder

[50]. Respondents use the same item scoring system as the
PHQ-9 to indicate frequency and severity of anxiety symptoms,
and a cut point of >10 is used to identify clinical cases of
anxiety.

Confidence in self-management of mental health issues was
measured using the MHSES [51], which has 6 items that address
confidence in managing stress, depression, and anxiety and are
scored on a 10-point scale (1: not at all confident, 10: very
confident). Ratings are summed for an overall measure of
self-efficacy (range 6 to 60), with higher scores indicating more
self-efficacy.

Safety was assessed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Parents were asked
to report any hospitalizations or ED visits made by their child
for depression/anxiety-related problems in the preceding 2 weeks
up to 1 month.

##### Utilization, Acceptability, and Feasibility

Deidentified aggregate app usage data were obtained from the
app developer. Metrics included aggregate descriptive
summaries of engagement metrics, including total number of
check-ins, days in app, and messages sent during the 4-week
intervention period. Each conversation with the app is tailored
to the users’reported needs at the moment and thus necessarily
varies in length and composition. Nonetheless, these metrics
are provided as examples to demonstrate various ways that users
engaged with the app’s offerings.

The acceptability and feasibility of using the intervention was
assessed after 2 weeks from the perspective of the adolescents
(n=10, 56%) and their parent or adult legal guardian (n=10,
44%) randomized to the intervention group of the RCT. Parents
completed the 4-item Acceptability of Intervention Measure
(AIM) and the 4-item Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM)
developed by Weiner et al [52]. To aid understanding by the
13- to 17-year-old adolescent participants, only 1 item from
each of these measures was used.

Adolescents assessed the usability of the app using 5 items from
the 10-item System Usability Scale (SUS) [53] that includes
statements about the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction
with use (score range 5 to 25). For the AIM, FIM, and SUS,
respondents used a 5-item response scale (1: completely
disagree, 5: completely agree) to indicate their agreement with
item statements, and a summary score was created. For the AIM
and FIM, higher scores indicated greater acceptability and
feasibility [52,54].

Acceptability and feasibility for PCPs were assessed by
semistructured interviews (described in the subsequent section).

##### Safety

For all participants, an additional layer of safety monitoring
was provided by the study team through surveillance of the
digital PHQ-9 assessment at baseline, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks.
Parents provided consent for communication between the study
team and the PCP for this purpose. When the PHQ-9 flagged
suicidal ideation, an email alert was sent to the study team, and


the PI then contacted the participant’s PCP to share information
and discuss next steps regarding assessment of suicide risk. The
principal investigator (PI; author JG) summarized the relevant
information and alerted the psychiatrist. Management options
included (1) the PCP electing to alert the family to the situation
and complete additional suicide risk assessment themselves or
(2) the PCP requesting further assessment be completed by the
pediatric study psychiatrist, who then conducted additional
assessment with patients and their legal guardians over the
phone and provided a brief written assessment and
recommendations back to the PCP. The PCP also had the option
of further discussing the case with the study psychiatrist by
phone. The PCP’s preferred management approach was
prioritized, and the psychiatrist provided further assessment by
phone and offered treatment recommendations to the PCP when
requested using an evidence-based telephone consultation model

[55].

##### Statistical Analyses

Summary statistics are reported as percentages for categorical
variables and mean and SD for continuous variables. We
evaluated the Cohen _d effect size and 95% CIs on the mean_
PHQ-9, GAD-7, and MHSES scores achieved by treatment
group at the primary end point of 4 weeks. All statistical
analyses were completed using SAS software version 9 (SAS
Institute Inc).

##### PCP Interviews

We completed semistructured interviews with PCPs to better
understand current attitudes toward and practices related to
recommending CBT to pediatric patients as well as toward the
use of mobile health applications for delivering behavioral
mental health interventions to youth.

PCPs who participated in the PBRN quality improvement (QI)
initiative were eligible to participate in the interviews, and all
received an email invitation. Interviews were conducted
concurrently with the pilot RCT portion of the study between
October 2020 and April 2021. A total of 13 PCPs from the 11
participating clinics completed a 30-minute virtual video
interview with the PI, who was also the PBRN director. She
used a semistructured interview guide to ask PCP about their
use of apps as part of a treatment plan to improve physical and
mental health, how they found out about apps to recommend,
and positive and negative features of the app considered when
selecting an app to recommend. After these general questions,
participating PCPs were provided with some promotional
material about the intervention app that included a picture of
the chatbot (without its name) and information about how it
interacts with the user. They were asked about their first
impressions, how likely they were to recommend it, and for
which patients and when in the treatment course it would likely
be most useful. Interviews were continued until thematic
saturation was achieved. All interviews were digitally recorded
and transcribed verbatim. Participants received a US $50 gift
card for participation.

##### Qualitative Analysis of PCP Interviews

Transcripts were analyzed using an inductive coding approach
based on pragmatic-variant grounded theory [56]. Authors JG

and GN independently reviewed interview transcripts for
emergent themes in PCP perspectives on the use of mobile
applications to augment physical and mental health care.

### Results

##### Pilot RCT

Figure 2 shows participant flow through the pilot RCT. Of the
40 families that completed the eligibility screening for the RCT,
17 (43%) were ineligible, 2 (5%) declined to participate, 3 (8%)
were lost to follow-up, and 18 (45%) were randomized to the
intervention (10/40, 25%) or wait list control (8/40, 2%). Chart

##### Participant Characteristics

The participating parent was typically the mother (16/17, 94%).
Participating teens are described in Table 1 and did not differ
by treatment group. They were predominantly female (15/17,
88%), White (15/17, 88%), and had family work-related health


review revealed the following diagnoses: depression (8/18,
44%), depressive symptoms (2/18, 11%), anxiety (16/18, 89%),
stress-related headaches (1/18, 6%), and functional abdominal
pain and adjustment disorder (1/18, 6%). A review of the notes
and baseline PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores resulted in a sample of
17 for the analyses, with 10 (59%) that had both depression and
anxiety 7 (41%) that had anxiety alone. One participant
originally randomized to the wait list control group was excluded
from analyses following chart review based on the chart notation
“episodic tension headaches due to stress” and baseline measures
(PHQ-9=5, GAD-7=6), as they were deemed to be ineligible
(no diagnosis of depression or anxiety in their chart and no
evidence of moderate disease).

insurance (15/17, 88%). Initial treatment plans did not differ
between study groups and included CBT (5/17, 29%),
unspecified counseling, 15/17, 88%), and SSRI medication
(11/17, 65%). By self-report, 7 (41%) teens had previously
received at least 1 counselling session for depression or anxiety.

##### Pilot RCT Outcomes

Table 2 and Figure 3 show the overall study results. The small
sample size precluded meaningful comparisons between study
groups. However, large effect sizes were observed between
groups on depression symptom severity score at 4 weeks, with
the intervention group showing greater improvement on each
scale than the wait list control group. Specifically, mean PHQ-9
scores at 4 weeks decreased by 3.3 units in the intervention


group (representing a transition from moderate to mild symptom
severity categories) and 2 units in the wait list control group
(no shift in symptom severity category). In subgroup analyses
among the 10 participants diagnosed with depression, PHQ-9
scores similarly decreased by 3 units in the intervention group
(11.8 to 8.8; from moderate to mild severity categories) versus
1 unit in the wait list control group (15 to 14; no shift in
symptom severity category).

PHQ-9: 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire.


We also compared remission in depressive symptoms (PHQ-9
<5) at 4 and 12 weeks in patients with a baseline PHQ-9 >9

[57] in the subgroup diagnosed with depression. The percentage
of participants achieving remission at both time points seemed
to favor the active intervention, at 67% (2/3) and 0% (0/5) at 4
weeks and 50% (1/2) and 20% (1/5) at 12 weeks, respectively.

##### Safety and Satisfaction With Care

When completing the PHQ-9 on one of the 6 adolescent surveys,
10 (59%) of participants, of which 4 (40%) were in the
intervention group and 6 (35%) were in the wait list control
group, triggered at least 1 alarm to assess for suicidal ideation.
During study participation, 4 (24%) of the participants had 1
alert, 4 (24%) had 3, and 2 (12%) had 6. These patients were
managed by their PCP with support from a pediatric research
psychiatrist, who interviewed all 4 (24%) participants by phone,
discussed management with the legal guardian (who was the
mother in all cases), and facilitated referral of 2 (12%)
participants to a child psychiatrist for ongoing clinical
management. One parent from the intervention group reported
at week 12 that their teen was seen in an ED and discharged to
home. Parental satisfaction with care did not differ between
study groups.

##### Acceptability, Feasibility, and Usability for Adolescents and Parents

Adolescents found the app to be (1) acceptable, with a total of
8 (80%) agreeing or completely agreeing with the statement “I
like using the app”; (2) feasible, with 7 (70%) agreeing with
the statement “using the app in the treatment of depression
seems possible”; and (3) usable (mean usability score 21.4, SD
1.7, possible range 5 to 25). The mean parental scores for
acceptability and feasibility were 16.6 (SD 1.8) and 17 (SD
1.5), respectively (possible range 1 to 20).


##### Acceptability and Feasibility for Providers

Potential advantages for learning CBT skills via an app
compared with face-to-face training identified by provider
participants included ease/immediacy of access to
evidence-based behavioral therapy, increased sense of
anonymity or reduction in perception of stigma against mental
health concerns, reduction in school absences to attend
appointments, no need for transportation to and from a
therapist’s office, and reduction of out-of-pocket costs. Although
providers acknowledged that an app might reduce common
barriers to engagement in therapy, they voiced several concerns
about using an app to augment clinical recommendations.
Concerns commonly involved efficacy of the app, the potential
safety risks of missing reports of suicidal ideation, overreliance
on technology and reduced self-efficacy for adaptive
help-seeking, increased screen time, and privacy and
confidentiality of sensitive information.

Providers generally felt that an app to deliver CBT and positive
psychology could be useful for teens with anxiety and
mild-to-moderate depression, particularly early in the course of
illness, and saw the app as being able to bridge the gap between
diagnosis and obtaining an appointment with a therapist or the
onset of therapeutic effects of prescribed antidepressant
medications—both of which can take several weeks. Due to
acute safety concerns, they recommended against using an app
in teens with active suicidality or self-harm. They felt these
patients needed closer clinical monitoring and were unlikely to
use the app because of their low motivation to adopt new
behaviors.

PCP participants suggested that the best time to introduce a
CBT app to patients and families as part of the treatment plan
would be at the time of diagnosis. Several suggested that usage


-----

JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH Nicol et al


might be improved if the pediatrician introduced the app during
an appointment and showed them how to download and use it
(eg, by saying to the patient, “Here’s what I’d like you to start
doing…”). In summary, a CBT app was acceptable to these
pediatric PCPs, and they suggested that it would be feasible to
use in teens with mild/moderate depression or anxiety.

##### App Utilization

Participant app use during the intervention period (collected via
the app) included days of app use, number of check-ins, and
number of messages sent, lesson and tools use rates, lesson
acceptability ratings indicated on a binary scale (ie, a thumbs
up or thumbs down emoticon), and mood impact after tool
utilization (ie, feeling same, better, or worse after completion).
In-the-moment emotional state was reported through emoji
selection with a default menu of 19 total moods, including
options for negative (angry, sad, and anxious), positive (happy
and content), and average mood (okay), with an additional
ability to type in free text emotion words and self-selected emoji
expressions.

Over the course of the intervention from baseline to 4 weeks,
participants’ app use averaged a mean of 6 (SD 6.9) days, with
55 (SD 7.14) mood check-ins, and 313.17 (SD 447.30) sent
messages, with the use of 13.63 (SD 4.5) psychoeducational
lessons and 9 (SD 14.91) tools. All completed psychoeducational
lessons were rated positively (thumbs up). Over two-thirds
(7/10, 69%) of participants reported feeling better after using
the app, with 25% (3/10) and 1% (1/10) reporting feeling the
same or worse, respectively.

### Discussion

In this pragmatically designed, randomized pilot and feasibility
study, we demonstrated the preliminary acceptability and
feasibility of augmenting initial depression treatment in
adolescents with CBT delivered via an evidence-based chatbot
intervention. Although the sample size needed to detect
between-group differences was not achieved, we observed a
trend toward improvement in depressive symptoms with the
app over a wait list control condition. Moreover, we observed
that the detection and management of suicidal ideation in
depressed adolescents was safely enhanced by use of the app
in concert with PCP-based clinical care and telephonic
consultation with a child psychiatrist. Finally, we found that
using this app to address depression and anxiety as part of an
overall treatment plan developed in collaboration with the
treating PCP was acceptable to the adolescents, their parents,
and their PCPs. These findings suggest that this app should be
further evaluated for use in the primary care management of
adolescents with depression and anxiety.

Adolescents visit their PCP 2 to 3 times per year on average
and commonly report feeling most comfortable disclosing
mental health concerns and obtaining mental health care in the
primary care setting [14]. A recent review to assess the efficacy
and acceptability of cell phone apps to support mental health
management in adolescents found high levels of adherence, but
few evaluative studies employed quantitative assessment of
these process measures, which are key for guiding real-world


implementation. This small pilot study provided additional
lessons regarding real-world clinical implementation of mobile
health interventions in pediatric primary care. For example, the
frequency of suicidal ideation reporting (as assessed by question
9 of the PHQ-9) decreased over the course of study participation,
even when the severity of other depressive symptoms remained
in a clinically significant range. Although this study was not
designed to detect differences between groups on suicidality,
we observed a reduction in self-reported suicidal ideation that
appeared to favor the active treatment group. This is particularly
relevant in the delivery of mental health care to adolescent
populations, who may feel more comfortable sharing such
information anonymously through an app than with a trusted
adult or health care provider.

Our results are subject to important limitations. First, despite
using a fully remote study design and a well-established PBRN
during a period of high mental health need, recruitment was
challenged by the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic
and the reduced access to and utilization of primary care
resources, especially early on in the pandemic. Although the
hybrid study design is important for piloting the intervention
in the patient population of interest, the results must be
interpreted with caution. Few conclusions can be drawn about
intervention effectiveness due to the small sample size and the
racial and geographic homogeneity and relative affluence of
the enrolled participants, who were mostly female, White, and
privately insured. The ability to detect differences between
treatment groups may have been further limited by the
concurrent use of antidepressant medications in some
participants. The results regarding implementation effectiveness
are subject to additional limitations, as the PBRN and PBRN
providers in this study are not representative of the broader
population of pediatric primary care clinics or providers in the
United States [16]. Moreover, our safety approach of providing
case review and rapid, individualized review and treatment
planning with a child psychiatrist may also have contributed to
the lack of separation between treatment groups, as everyone
in the study received high-quality clinical care and close
follow-up for suicidality reported on the PHQ-9.

The fully remote nature of the trial, which was conducted during
critical periods in the COVID-19 pandemic, when child and
adolescent mental health needs were most critical, was both a
limitation and a strength. Additionally, this is the first study we
are aware of that employed digital assessment and remote
methods for managing suicidality in adolescents. The concern
that suicidality will be exacerbated or missed with digital
interventions has been a major barrier to offering these
treatments to youth. The method we used to ensure safety (phone
consultation with a child psychiatrist within 24 hours of
reporting clinically significant suicidal ideation) could not have
disguised symptom severity in the wait list control group, since
we were responsive to all alerts. Another major strength of this
pilot study was evaluating the feasibility of implementation in
a real-world primary care setting. Although this study does not
provide sufficient evidence to support the use of apps in primary
care settings for teens with mental health problems [21], the
results presented in this paper provide promising evidence that
preliminarily support the feasibility of using a CBT-based
