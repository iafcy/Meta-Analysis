A nurse versus a chatbot ‒ the effect of an
empowerment program on chemotherapy-
related side effects and the self-care
behaviors of women living with breast Cancer:
a randomized controlled trial

Abstract
Background The high levels of unmet needs in relation to provision of self-care information reported by women
living with breast cancer suggests that pre-chemotherapy education is suboptimal. Chatbots are emerging as a
promising platform to provide education to patients helping them self-manage their symptoms at home. However,
evidence from empirical studies on the effect of chatbots education on women living with breast cancer self-care
behaviors and symptoms management are scarce.
Methods This three-arm randomized controlled trial was performed in a chemotherapy day care center within an
oncology center in Egypt. A total of 150 women living with breast cancer were randomly selected and randomized
into three groups: the ChemoFreeBot group (n = 50), the nurse-led education group (n = 50), and the routine care
group (n = 50). In the ChemoFreeBot group, women were given a link to interact with ChemoFreeBot and ask
questions about their symptoms and self-care interventions by typing questions or keywords at any time. On the
same day as their first day of chemotherapy, the nurse-led education group received face to face teaching sessions
from the researcher (nurse) about side effects and self-care interventions. The routine care group received general
knowledge during their chemotherapy session about self-care interventions. The self-care behaviors effectiveness and
the frequency, severity and distress of chemotherapy side effects were measured at baseline and postintervention for
the three groups. The ChemoFreeBot’s usability was assessed.
Results The mixed design repeated measures ANOVA analyses revealed a statistically significant both group effect
and interaction effect of group*time, indicating a significant difference between the three groups in terms of
the physical symptoms frequency (F = 76.075, p < .001, F = 147, p < .001, respectively), severity (F = 96.440, p < .001,
F = 220.462, p < .001), and distress (F = 77.171, p < .001, F = 189.680, p < .001); the psychological symptoms frequency
(F = 63.198, p < .001, F = 137.908, p < .001), severity (F = 62.137, p < .001), (F = 136.740, p < .001), and distress (F = 43.003,

respectively). The Post hoc analysis with Bonferroni adjustment in showed that women in the ChemoFreeBot group
experienced a statistically significant less frequent, less severe and less distressing physical and psychological
symptoms and higher effective self-care behaviors than those in the nurse-led education and routine care groups
(p > .001).
Conclusion ChemoFreeBot was a useful and cost-effective tool to improve increase self-care behavior and reduce
chemotherapy side effects in women living with breast cancer through the provision of personalized education and
the improvement of the accessibility to real-time and high-quality information compared to “one size fits all” approach
used by nurses to provide the information. ChemoFreeBot can be an empowering tool to assist nurses to educate
women with breast cancer and allow women to take an active role in managing their symptom.
