Abstract
Background: Artificial intelligence–based chatbots are emerging as instruments of psychological intervention; however, no
relevant studies have been reported in Latin America.
Objective: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the viability, acceptability, and potential impact of using Tess, a
chatbot, for examining symptoms of depression and anxiety in university students.
Methods: This was a pilot randomized controlled trial. The experimental condition used Tess for 8 weeks, and the control
condition was assigned to a psychoeducation book on depression. Comparisons were conducted using Mann-Whitney U and
Wilcoxon tests for depressive symptoms, and independent and paired sample ttests to analyze anxiety symptoms.
Results: The initial sample consisted of 181 Argentinian college students (158, 87.2% female) aged 18 to 33. Data at week 8
were provided by 39 out of the 99 (39%) participants in the experimental condition and 34 out of the 82 (41%) in the control
group. On an average, 472 (SD 249.52) messages were exchanged, with 116 (SD 73.87) of the messages sent from the users in
response to Tess. A higher number of messages exchanged with Tess was associated with positive feedback (F =4.37; P=.02).
2,36
No significant differences between the experimental and control groups were found from the baseline to week 8 for depressive
and anxiety symptoms. However, significant intragroup differences demonstrated that the experimental group showed a significant
decrease in anxiety symptoms; no such differences were observed for the control group. Further, no significant intragroup
differences were found for depressive symptoms.
Conclusions: The students spent a considerable amount of time exchanging messages with Tess and positive feedback was
associated with a higher number of messages exchanged. The initial results show promising evidence for the usability and
acceptability of Tess in the Argentinian population. Research on chatbots is still in its initial stages and further research is needed.
