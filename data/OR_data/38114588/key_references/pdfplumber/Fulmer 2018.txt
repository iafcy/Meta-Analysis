Abstract
Background: Students in need of mental health care face many barriers including cost, location, availability, and stigma. Studies
show that computer-assisted therapy and 1 conversational chatbot delivering cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offer a
less-intensive and more cost-effective alternative for treating depression and anxiety. Although CBT is one of the most effective
treatment methods, applying an integrative approach has been linked to equally effective posttreatment improvement. Integrative
psychological artificial intelligence (AI) offers a scalable solution as the demand for affordable, convenient, lasting, and secure
support grows.
Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of using an integrative psychological AI, Tess, to reduce
self-identified symptoms of depression and anxiety in college students.
Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 75 participants were recruited from 15 universities across the United States. All
participants completed Web-based surveys, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Scale (GAD-7), and Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) at baseline and 2 to 4 weeks later (T2). The 2 test groups
consisted of 50 participants in total and were randomized to receive unlimited access to Tess for either 2 weeks (n=24) or 4 weeks
(n=26). The information-only control group participants (n=24) received an electronic link to the National Institute of Mental
Health’s (NIMH) eBook on depression among college students and were only granted access to Tess after completion of the
study.
Results: A sample of 74 participants completed this study with 0% attrition from the test group and less than 1% attrition from
the control group (1/24). The average age of participants was 22.9 years, with 70% of participants being female (52/74), mostly
Asian (37/74, 51%), and white (32/74, 41%). Group 1 received unlimited access to Tess, with daily check-ins for 2 weeks. Group
2 received unlimited access to Tess with biweekly check-ins for 4 weeks. The information-only control group was provided with
an electronic link to the NIMH’s eBook. Multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted. We used an alpha level of .05 for
all statistical tests. Results revealed a statistically significant difference between the control group and group 1, such that group
1 reported a significant reduction in symptoms of depression as measured by the PHQ-9 (P=.03), whereas those in the control
group did not. A statistically significant difference was found between the control group and both test groups 1 and 2 for symptoms
of anxiety as measured by the GAD-7. Group 1 (P=.045) and group 2 (P=.02) reported a significant reduction in symptoms of
anxiety, whereas the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found on the PANAS between the control
group and group 1 (P=.03) and suggests that Tess did impact scores.

Conclusions: This study offers evidence that AI can serve as a cost-effective and accessible therapeutic agent. Although not
designed to appropriate the role of a trained therapist, integrative psychological AI emerges as a feasible option for delivering
support.

Editorial notice: This randomized study was only retrospectively registered. The editor granted an exception from ICMJE rules
mandating prospective registration of randomized trials, because the study was considered formative. However, readers are
advised to carefully assess the validity of any potential explicit or implicit claims related to primary outcomes or effectiveness,
as retrospective registration does not prevent authors from changing their outcome measures retrospectively.
Conflicts of Interest
AJ and MR are employees of X2AI Inc that created the intervention (Tess) that was used in this trial and, therefore, have financial
interest in that company. X2AI Inc covered the cost of participant incentives.
