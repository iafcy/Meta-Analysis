Abstract
Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety commonly coexist with chronic musculoskeletal pain, and when this occurs,
standard orthopedic treatment is less effective. However, mental health intervention is not yet a routine part of standard orthopedic
treatment, in part because of access-related barriers. Digital mental health intervention is a potential scalable resource that could
be feasibly incorporated into orthopedic care.
Objective: This study’s primary purpose was to assess the feasibility of introducing a digital mental health intervention (Wysa)
in an outpatient orthopedic setting to patients with coexisting symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. The secondary purpose
was to perform a preliminary effectiveness analysis of the intervention.
Methods: In this single-arm, prospective cohort study, participants included adult patients (18 years and older) who presented
to a nonsurgical orthopedic specialist at a single tertiary care academic center for evaluation of a musculoskeletal condition and
who self-reported symptoms of depression and/or anxiety (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
[PROMIS] Depression and/or Anxiety score ≥55). Face-to-face enrollment was performed by a research coordinator immediately
after the participant’s encounter with an orthopedic clinician. Participants were provided 2 months of access to a mobile app
called Wysa, which is an established, multicomponent digital mental health intervention that uses chatbot technology and text-based
access to human counselors to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness training, and sleep tools, among other features.
For this study, Wysa access also included novel, behavioral activation–based features specifically developed for users with chronic
pain. Primary feasibility outcomes included the study recruitment rate, retention rate, and engagement rate with Wysa (defined
as engagement with a therapeutic Wysa tool at least once during the study period). Secondary effectiveness outcomes were
between-group differences in mean longitudinal PROMIS mental and physical health score changes at 2-month follow-up between
high and low Wysa users, defined by a median split.
Results: The recruitment rate was 29.3% (61/208), retention rate was 84% (51/61), and engagement rate was 72% (44/61).
Compared to low users, high users reported greater improvement in PROMIS Anxiety scores (between-group difference −4.2
points, 95% CI −8.1 to −0.2; P=.04) at the 2-month follow-up. Between-group differences in PROMIS Depression (−3.2 points,
95% CI −7.5 to 1.2; P=.15) and Pain Interference scores (−2.3 points, 95% CI −6.3 to 1.7; P=.26) favored high users but did not
meet statistical significance. Improvements in PROMIS Physical Function scores were comparable between groups.

Conclusions: Delivery of a digital mental health intervention within the context of orthopedic care is feasible and has the
potential to improve mental health and pain-related impairment to a clinically meaningful degree. Participants’engagement rates
exceeded industry standards, and additional opportunities to improve recruitment and retention were identified. Further pilot
study followed by a definitive, randomized controlled trial is warranted.

Acknowledgments
This study was funded by a Washington University/BJC HealthCare Big Ideas innovation grant. Work on this study was also
supported by the National Institutes of Health (K23AR074520) and the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (to ALC). The study
team purchased participant access codes for Wysa’s novel version tailored for people with chronic pain (which is not commercially
available). Wysa provided participants’deidentified app usage data to the study team free of charge.
