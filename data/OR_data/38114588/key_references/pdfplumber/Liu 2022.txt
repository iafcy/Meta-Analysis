Objective: This study aimed to compare chatbot therapy to bibliotherapy, which is a widely accepted and proven-
useful self-help psychological intervention. The main objective of this study is to add to the evidence of effec-
tiveness for chatbot therapy as a convenient, affordable, interactive self-help intervention for depression.
Methods: An unblinded randomized controlled trial with 83 university students was conducted. The participants
were randomly assigned to either a chatbot test group (n =41) to receive a newly developed chatbot-delivered
intervention, or a bibliotherapy control group (n =42) to receive a minimal level of bibliotherapy. A set of
questionnaires was implemented as measurements of clinical variables at baseline and every 4 weeks for a period
of 16 weeks, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale
(GAD-7), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) and
the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) were used to measure satisfaction and therapeutic
alliance after the intervention. Participants' self-reported adherence and feedback on the therapy chatbot were
also collected.
Results: Participants were all university students (undergraduate students (n =31), postgraduate students (n =
52)). They were between 19 and 28 years old (mean =23.08, standard deviation (SD) =1.76) and 55.42% (46/
83) female. 24.07% (20/83) participants were lost to follow-up. No significant group difference was found at
baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, individuals in the chatbot test group showed a significant reduction in
the PHQ-9 scores (F = 22.89; P < 0.01) and the GAD-7 scores (F = 5.37; P = 0.02). Follow-up analysis of
completers suggested that the reduction of anxiety was significant only in the first 4 weeks. The WAI-SR scores in
the chatbot group were higher compared to the bibliotherapy group (t =7.29; P <0.01). User feedback showed
that process factors were more influential than the content factors.
Conclusions: The chatbot-delivered self-help depression intervention was proven to be superior to the minimal
level of bibliotherapy in terms of reduction on depression, anxiety, and therapeutic alliance achieved with
participants.
