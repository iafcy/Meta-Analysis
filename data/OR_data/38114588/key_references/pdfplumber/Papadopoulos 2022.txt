Abstract
This trial represents the final stage of the CARESSES project which aimed to develop and evaluate a culturally competent
artificial intelligent system embedded into social robots to support older adult wellbeing. A parallel group, single-blind ran-
domised controlled trial was conducted across older adult care homes in England and Japan. Participants randomly allocated
to the Experimental Group or Control Group 1 received a Pepper robot for up 18 h across 2 weeks. Two versions of the
CARESSES artificial intelligence were tested: a fully culturally competent system (Experimental Group) and a more limited
version (Control Group 1). Control Group 2 (Care As Usual) participants did not receive a robot. Quantitative outcomes
of interest reported in the current paper were health-related quality of life (SF-36), loneliness (ULS-8), and perceptions
of robotic cultural competence (CCATool-Robotics). Thirty-three residents completed all procedures. The difference in
SF-36 Emotional Wellbeing scores between Experimental Group and Care As Usual participants over time was significant
(F[1] = 6.614, sig = .019, η 2 = .258), as was the comparison between Any Robot used and Care As Usual (F[1] = 5.128,
p
sig = .031, η 2 = .146). There were no significant changes in SF-36 physical health subscales. ULS-8 loneliness scores slightly
p
improved among Experimental and Control Group 1 participants compared to Care As Usual participants, but this was not
significant. This study brings new evidence which cautiously supports the value of culturally competent socially assistive
robots in improving the psychological wellbeing of older adults residing in care settings.

therefore non-parametric tests were applied. For within-
group repeated analyses, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were
applied. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) tests were also
carried out to measure and compare post-intervention out-
come scores across a grouping variable (controlling for base-
line scores). Grouping variables were constructed according
to the group to which they were allocated to (Experimental
Group, Control Group 1, Control Group 2). To expand the
available analytical comparisons, an ‘Any Robot’ grouping
variable was constructed which combined the data collected
from the Experimental Group and Control Group 1 groups.

3 Results
3.1 Sample Characteristics
Nine care homes across England (n = 8) and Japan (n = 1)
agreed to participate. Across these homes, 134 residents
were nominated by care staff, 111 of whom passed screen-
ing. During initial recruitment procedures, it was observed
that twelve further residents were unlikely to meet eligibil-
ity criteria (mainly due to perceived memory problems). Of
the remaining 99 participants, 45 consented although ten
subsequently dropped out prior to tests commencing. The
remaining 35 participants commenced procedures although
two participants (both allocated to control group 1) withdrew
after 1 session (n = 1) and 2 sessions (n = 1). Thus, overall,
33 residents fully participated who identified themselves as
primarily belonging to English (n = 15), Indian (n = 15) or
Japanese (n = 3) cultures. The recruitment rate (eligible and
invited / participated) was therefore 35.4%. The main rea-
sons for declining participation were: ‘too tired’ (n = 14),
no interest in project (n = 5), against the idea of robots in
care homes (n = 3), too busy (n = 3) and family refused to
consent (n = 3).
As can be seen in Tables 1 and 2, participants’ age ranged
from 65—98 years (Mean = 81.9; SD = 9.82), the oldest
of whom were Japanese (M = 86; SD = 9.54) followed by
English (M = 83.67; SD = 10.3) and Indian participants
(M = 79.4; SD = 9.36). The sample was predominantly
female (n = 22), educational level was fairly equally dis-
tributed, and most participants were married at some point
in their lives, with a large portion now widowed (n = 23).

Participants were of multiple specific religious faiths
which for analytical purposes were categorised as Christian
(n = 13), Hindu (n = 14) or other (this mostly consisted of
atheist or ‘non-religious’ people) (n = 6). A full overview of
participant characteristics per group allocation can be found
in Table 3.
3.2 Quantitative outcome measures
Table 4 describes the overall mean total scores of each out-
come measure at initial assessment (either Baseline [T0]
or after one week [T1] depending on tool) and post-inter-
vention [T2] per group. SF-36 mental health total mean
scores significantly decreased for the Care As Usual group
(T0: M = 76.22 [SD = 16.51]; T2: M = 63.30 [SD = 25.3];
p < 0.05), whereas participants receiving a robot did not
observe such a reduction, and, in the case of the Experi-
mental group, a slight increase (T0: M = 77.59 [SD = 16.4];
T2: M = 78.39 [SD = 12.15]) was observed. For the SF-36
mental health subscales, small score improvements for the
Experimental Group can also be seen for the ‘role limita-
tions—emotional’ (i.e. the degree to which emotional health
impacts upon one’s ability to conduct their usual roles) (T0:
M = 86.11 [SD = 33.21]; T2: M = 90.28 [SD = 28.83]) and
‘energy and fatigue’ subscales (T0: M = 57.92 [SD = 23.82];
T2: M = 60.00 [SD = 24.31]). However, a significant
decrease in the ‘role limitations—emotional’ scale was also
observed for the Control group across the two time points
(T0: M = 87.88 [SD = 30.81]; T2: M = 60.60 [SD = 44.27];
Z = − 2.041, sig = 0.041). A numerical although non-sig-
nificant mean score increase was observed for the ‘emo-
tional wellbeing’ subscale in the Experimental group
(T0: M = 83.00 [SD = 11.83]; T2: M = 89.33 [SD = 7.69])
whereas a considerable numerical decrease was observed
for the Care As Usual group (T0: M = 82.80 [SD = 12.66];
T2: M = 67.60 [SD = 29.96]). As seen in Tables 5 and 6,
ANCOVA comparisons revealed that the relative improve-
ment of ‘emotional wellbeing’ subscale scores between
Experimental group participants and Care As Usual partici-
pants over time was significant (F[1] = 6.614, sig = 0.019,
η 2 = 0.258), as was the comparison between Any Robot
p
(i.e. participants in the Experimental or Control group)
and Care As Usual (F[1] = 5.128, sig = 0.031, η 2 = 0.146).
p
There were no significant changes in mean scores over time
in SF-36 physical health subscales or with the ULS-8 loneli-
ness scores. However, for the latter, the ‘Any Robot’, Experi-
mental and Control groups experienced a slight reduction
in loneliness severity between T0 and T2 (Exp group: T0:
M = 14.9 [SD = 4.98]; T2: M = 14.3 [SD = 3.53], Control
Group: T0: M = 18.8 [SD = 4.73]; T2: M = 17.2 [SD = 6.46])
whereas the Care As Usual group saw a slight increase in
loneliness scores (T0: M = 15.7 [SD = 4.73]; T2: M = 16.5
[SD = 5.4]).

Regarding perceptions of cultural competence, both ver-
sions of the robot produced fairly high levels of CCATool
scores at both time points. However, the Experimental
group’s robot performed better than the Control group’s
robot at both time points in all but two of the subscales (Sub-
scale B: Cultural Sensitivity at T2 and Subscale D: Cultural
Competence at T1). CCATool scores increased between T1
and T2 for all scales within the Experimental group and all
but in one scale for the Control group (Subscale D: Cul-
tural Competence—T1: M = 4.91 [SD = 1.51, T2: M = 4.45
[SD = 1.51]). A full breakdown of CCATool scores can be
seen in Table 7.
4 Discussion and Conclusions
While the findings are nuanced and are the product of an
exploratory trial with several limitations, overall, the results
cautiously provide further evidence in support of socially
assistive robots being used to support older adults in care
settings in a supplementary way, particularly in relation to
mental health and emotional wellbeing.
Firstly, fairly large and positive score changes in the
‘emotional wellbeing’ subscale were observed in both the
Any Robot group and the Experimental group, whereas no
change in score was observed for the Control group and a
fairly large decrease in scores was observed for the Care As
Usual group. When assessing the magnitude of change in
scores over time between groups, the differences between
improved scores in the Any Robot group compared to the
Care As Usual group, and between the Experimental group
compared to the Care As Usual group, were significant. This
implies that using a CARESSES robot (ideally the Experi-
mental Robot) compared to not using any robot may indeed
be likely to improve older adults’ emotional wellbeing, even
only after a period of 2 weeks. Whether and to what degree
this effect may hold or change over time is however currently
unknown.
When examining the SF-36 mental health total scores,
which may be argued to be a less precise way of measuring
mental health than the ‘emotional wellbeing’ subscale alone
[31, 32], the differences in score change over time between
groups were close to meeting the statistical significance
threshold (Experimental group vs Care As Usual group:
F[1] = 4.249, sig = 0.054; Experimental group vs Control
group: F[1] = 3.836, sig = 0.065). These findings lend fur-
ther support to the notion that having access to a version of
the CARESSES intervention over 2 weeks may be likely to
protect older adults’ mental health compared to not using
any robot, and that the Experimental robot is likely to be
particularly effective at this.
The Experimental robot also produced better scores
during testing on the ‘role limitation—emotional’ SF-36

did offer participants the option to watch exercise videos and
in a few cases the participants attempted to copy some of the
basic exercises they were watching. However, clearly the
offer of videos and providing tips about improving physical
health was not effective in producing clear physical health
improvements in such a short period of time and with what
is a frail and physically disabled population. It should also be
noted that there are limitations associated with the hardware
given that the Pepper robot is not designed or able to provide
any physical assistance. The Pepper hardware is also not able
to dispense medication which in theory could have boosted
medication adherence and thus physical health may have
been improved. Furthermore, it may have been helpful for
the system to have included reminders about taking medi-
cation; however, this feature was not made available during
testing due to ethical concerns.
With regard to loneliness, ULS-8 baseline scores for the
study samples were identified to be fairly high, which for this
population is unsurprising [33, 34]. During testing, severity
of loneliness slightly increased in the Care As Usual group
whereas slight decreases were observed for the Experimental
and Control Robot groups. These results can be interpreted
in several ways. First, they indicate that using a culturally
competent robot may be reasonably unlikely to increase
loneliness compared to care as usual. Second, they indicate
that, even over a short period of time (2 weeks), a slight
reduction in loneliness may be observed. If these trends
were to continue over time, these differences may become
more meaningful. Third, if the full CARESSES culturally
competent software was made available to the Experimental
robot from the outset (rather than only during the second
week of testing), the improvements in outcomes related to
loneliness (and mental health) would likely have been even
larger. However, it is clear that more work to improve the
depth and impact of the system to drive down loneliness is
required. Such improvements may tie-in with enhancements
to the ‘social functioning’ part of the system, so that future
systems can have a stronger focus on improving the social
capital and circumstances of the individual [35].
Finally, with regard to perception of cultural compe-
tence, the results of the CCATool show that after one and
two weeks of use, both the Experimental group’s robot
and Control group’s robot were, overall, perceived to be
reasonably culturally competent. Both versions of the
robot were perceived to be more culturally competent
after two weeks than compared to after one week, although
the Experimental group showed greater improvement in
scores overall. This may suggest that the changes made to
the system after week 1, to increase cultural competence
of the system (e.g. by enabling personalisation towards
individual cultural values), had a positive impact upon per-
ceptions of cultural competence and, as expected, a greater
level of impact with the Experimental group participants.
