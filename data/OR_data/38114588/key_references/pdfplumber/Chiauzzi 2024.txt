Abstract
Background Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) may reduce treatment access issues for those experienc‑
ing depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. DMHIs that incorporate relational agents may offer unique ways to engage
and respond to users and to potentially help reduce provider burden. This study tested Woebot for Mood & Anxiety
(W‑MA‑02), a DMHI that employs Woebot, a relational agent that incorporates elements of several evidence‑based
psychotherapies, among those with baseline clinical levels of depressive or anxiety symptoms. Changes in self‑
reported depressive and anxiety symptoms over 8 weeks were measured, along with the association between each
of these outcomes and demographic and clinical characteristics.
Methods This exploratory, single‑arm, 8‑week study of 256 adults yielded non‑mutually exclusive subsamples
with either clinical levels of depressive or anxiety symptoms at baseline. Week 8 Patient Health Questionnaire‑8 (PHQ‑
8) changes were measured in the depressive subsample (PHQ‑8 ≥ 10). Week 8 Generalized Anxiety Disorder‑7 (GAD‑7)
changes were measured in the anxiety subsample (GAD‑7 ≥ 10). Demographic and clinical characteristics were exam‑
ined in association with symptom changes via bivariate and multiple regression models adjusted for W‑MA‑02 utiliza‑
tion. Characteristics included age, sex at birth, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, sexual orientation, employ‑
ment status, health insurance, baseline levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and concurrent psychotherapeutic
or psychotropic medication treatments during the study.
Results Both the depressive and anxiety subsamples were predominantly female, educated, non‑Hispanic white,
and averaged 38 and 37 years of age, respectively. The depressive subsample had significant reductions in depres‑
sive symptoms at Week 8 (mean change =—7.28, SD = 5.91, Cohen’s d = ‑1.23, p < 0.01); the anxiety subsample had
significant reductions in anxiety symptoms at Week 8 (mean change = ‑7.45, SD = 5.99, Cohen’s d = ‑1.24, p < 0.01). No
significant associations were found between sex at birth, age, employment status, educational background and Week
8 symptom changes. Significant associations between depressive and anxiety symptom outcomes and sexual orien‑
tation, marital status, concurrent mental health treatment, and baseline symptom severity were found.

Conclusions The present study suggests early promise for W‑MA‑02 as an intervention for depression and/or anxi‑
ety symptoms. Although exploratory in nature, this study revealed potential user characteristics associated with out‑
comes that can be investigated in future studies.
Trial Registration This study was retrospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT05672745) on January 5th,
2023.
