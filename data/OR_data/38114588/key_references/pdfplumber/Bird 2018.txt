Introduction
With the wide availability of computers and ready access to the internet, a number of
psychological interventions have been developed into web-based instruments (Proudfoot
et al., 2003; Shaw et al., 1999). There is now good evidence that computerized versions
of interventions are effective, especially for mild to moderate cases (Andrews and Titov,
2009; Proudfoot et al., 2004). One important limitation of computer-based tools is that they
relyonclientsaccessingandusingtheweb-basedresourcesappropriatelyandwithoutdirect
therapist supervision, making it important to develop software that is very accessible and
straightforwardtouseforclients.Authorshavethereforearguedthatitwouldbebeneficialto

Method
Participants
ThestudysampleconsistedofstudentsandstaffrecruitedfromtheUniversityofManchester
andtheUniversityofLiverpool,UK.Thestudywasadvertisedviatheuniversities’research
volunteering websites and with recruitment posters. Undergraduate Psychology students
completed the study in exchange for course credits. Advertisements asked for volunteers
currently experiencing a problem that was causing distress. Figure1 presents progression
throughthestudyforallparticipants.
Measures
Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale – Short form (DASS-21) (Lovibond and Lovibond,
1995). This is a 21-item version of the DASS scale with three 7-item subscales measuring
depression,anxietyandstressoverthepast7days.Itemsareratedona4-pointLikertscale
from 0 (‘Did not apply to me at all’) to 3 (‘Applied to me most of the time’). Normative
studieshavefoundhighinternalconsistencyforthescale,withCronbachalphavaluesof0.91

samplereliabilitybasedontheavailabledata(n=173)was0.76(depression),0.78(anxiety)
and0.78(stress).
Problemratings. Participantswereaskedtoprovidetheirageandgender.Theywerealso
askedtobrieflydescribetheproblemtheywouldbefocusingonwhenutilizingtheprogram.
They were then asked to rate their current distress about the problem (on an 11-point scale
from 0, ‘Not distressing at all’ to 10, ‘Highly distressing’) and how easily they believed it
wouldberesolved(onan11-pointscalefrom0,‘Cannotberesolved’to10,‘Easilyresolved’).
These ratings were repeated at follow-up, but the ease of resolution item was re-worded at

and2-weekfollow-upsparticipantswerealsoasked‘Howwelldoyoufeelthesessionwith

‘Extremelyhelpful’).

The primary outcome measure for the study was problem-related distress. DASS-21,
problem resolution, and helpfulness were secondary outcome measures. Primary outcome
analyses used general linear modelling repeated measures with group (MYLO, ELIZA) as
a between-participants factor and time (baseline, post-intervention, 2-week follow-up) as a
within-participants factor. Ratings of helpfulness and problem resolution were compared at

Discussion
TheprimaryaimofthestudypresentedinthispaperwastoinvestigatetheefficacyofMYLO
asareadilyavailableweb-basedresource,andcomparingitwithELIZA,whichprovidedan
active control condition with a similar interface. Analyses did not find MYLO to be more
effective than ELIZA for bringing about reductions in psychological distress and symptoms
ofanxietyanddepression,withmodestbutsignificantreductionsobservedinbothconditions,
includingfurtherimprovementat2-weekfollow-up.WefoundthatparticipantsratedMYLO
asmoreeffectiveinresolvingtheirproblemimmediatelyafterusingit.MYLOwasalsofound
toberatedassignificantlymorehelpfulthanELIZAforresolvingparticipants’problems.Data
on the amount of time participants spent using the programs also indicated that participants
usedMYLOforlonger,whichmayindicatethatthisprogramwasconsideredmoreacceptable.
These findings are consistent with those from the pilot, laboratory-based trial of MYLO
(Gaffneyetal.,2014).WhileMYLOwasnotfoundtobemoreeffectivethanELIZA,these
findings do provide support for the use of web-based interventions for helping individuals
with mild to moderate distress. The results also revealed significant differences in symptom
reductionbetweenthosewhometcriteriaformoderatesymptomseverityandthosewhodid
not, with those meeting criteria for moderate severity experiencing greater improvements at
both immediate follow-up and 2 weeks later. Our results provide evidence that web-based
interventions using a ‘chatbot’ interface can help with resolving problems and reducing
associateddistress,evenforthoseexperiencinghigherlevelsofdistressatbaseline.However,

inclusionofano-treatmentconditiontocomparetheeffectsofMYLOwithnaturalrecovery.
Thelimitationsofthepresentstudy’sdesignlimitwhatwecanconcludefromtheresults.
Although the trial was randomized and included a control condition, the absence of a no-
treatmentgroupmeanswecannotbesurethatchangesinsymptomsareduetotheinterventions
or whether they simply reflect the symptoms improving over time (Posternak and Miller,
2001). Regression to the mean could explain the differences in change scores between high
andlowdistressparticipantsatthe2-weekfollow-up.However,resultsdidrevealimmediate
reductions in distress and symptom scores after using the programs for an average of only
10minutes,whicharelesslikelytobeduetoregressiontothemean.Despiteitslimitations
thestudydemonstratesthefeasibilityofprovidingweb-basedinterventionsusingthistypeof
interface, and that such interventions can help to reduce distress in the short-term. Attrition
at2-weekfollow-upwasquitehigh,andalthoughtheuseoflastobservationcarriedforward
providesaconservativeestimateofmissingobservations(EngelsandDiehr,2003),thehigh
attrition does limit the generalizability of the longitudinal effects found in this study. The
designalsomeantthatindividualswhodroppedoutpriortoaccessingtheprogramscouldnotbe
includedinlastobservationcarriedforwardanalyses,asitwasnotknownwhichconditionthey
wouldhavebeenrandomizedto.Asaresult,thedatacouldnotbeanalysedusingintentionto

Attrition is a problem with unsupported online interventions more generally. Drop-out in
thecurrentstudywascomparabletopreviousresearchusingunguidedweb-basedCBT,where
attritionwasover70%(Christensenetal.,2006).Itisalsopossibleinthecurrentstudythat
thecharacteristicsofthestudysamplecontributedtoattrition,astheproblemsbeingdiscussed

is also evidence that using unpublished scales can lead to positive findings that would not
have been obtained using validated instruments (Marshall et al., 2000). Given the number
of outcome measures a potential limitation of the current study is the lack of correction for
multiplecomparisons,withthepotentialforTypeIerror.
