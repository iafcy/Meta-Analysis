Background: Mental health difficulties are highly prevalent, yet access to support is
limitedbybarriersofstigma,cost,andavailability.Theseissuesareevenmoreprevalent
in low- and middle-income countries, and digital technology is one potential way to
overcome these barriers. Digital mental health interventions are effective but often
struggle with low engagement rates, particularly in the absence of human support.

Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale
(DASS-21) - Stress Subscale
The DASS-21 is a 21 item self-report questionnaire consisting
of three scales to measure depression, anxiety, and stress. Only
the stress subscale was used, this consists of seven items, and
the user is asked how much each statement applies to them in
the past week (e.g., I found it difficult to relax). Scores range
from 0 (did not apply) to 3 (applied very much or most of the
time).Totalscoresaredoubledanddividedintofivecategories:

andextremelysevere(34 )levelsofstress(24,25).

PROCEDURES
After installing Vitalk, users complete a sign-up process that
includes consenting to their anonymized data being used for
research purposes. The user is then engaged in a conversation
with the chatbot, who welcomes them to Vitalk and together
they complete the baseline outcome measures. User responses
are recorded and scored by the chatbot, and the user receives
customizedfeedbackbasedontheirscores.Theuserthenchooses
which of the three programs to complete, or they can ask the
chatbottorecommendonebasedontheirscores.
After a program has been selected, the core content is
scheduled for delivery to the user over the course of 30 days.
When new content is delivered, the user is alerted to a new
message,andtheychoosewhethertoengageintheconversation.
The responses of the user shape the conversation. Original
