Technological advancements re-shaped user-product interactions by enabling people
to make conversation with interactive systems. This new form of interaction led
designers to create a new type of user interface: Conversational User Interface (CUI).
Expensive psychological therapy fees and people’s increased awareness related to
importance of well-being attracted the interactive system developers to create a
domain specific Conversational Agent, which is particularly focusing on
psychological terapy and has CUI. In order to maintain user engagement and sustain
usage, design of such systems is important. However, existing design guidelines for
Conversational Agents are limited and focus on business functions of these agents;
however, conversational experience should be the main focus for designers to sustain
user engagement and support people’s well-being.
The aim of this research is to explore design qualities of Conversational Agent’s that
focuses on enhancing people’s subjective well-being, to accomplish sustained usage
and engagement with the conversational agent and propose guidance for designing
such agents. For this purpose, interviews were conducted with users. Woebot, a
Conversational Agent, which is designed for promoting people’s subjective well-being
was selected as a case for the study and evaluated by 16 participants. The
interpretations of the participants were obtained by semi- structured and in-depth
interviews. Through analysing the results of the interviews, improvement suggestions
are presented regarding system operations and functionality in terms of its
attractiveness, perspicuity, effectiveness, stimulation, dependability, efficiency and
novelty. Lastly, the study provides insights that would affect users’ engagement and
overall experience.
Keywords: conversational agents, conversation design, subjective well-being,

Teknolojik gelişmeler, insanların interaktif sistemlerle sohbet etmelerini sağlayarak
kullanıcı etkileşimlerini yeniden şekillendirdi. Bu yeni etkileşim türü, tasarımcıları
Konuşma Kullanıcı Arayüzü (Conversational User Interface - CUI) adı verilen yeni
bir kullanıcı arayüzü tasarlamaya yönlendirdi. Pahalı psikolojik terapi ücretleri ve
insanların öznel iyi oluşun önemi hakkında farkındalığının oluşması, interaktif sistem
geliştiricilerinin bu tür terapiye odaklanan ve Konuşma Kullanıcı Arayüzüne sahip
olan alana özelleşmiş sohbet aracısı tasarlama konusunda ilgilerini çekti. Kullanıcı
bağlılığını sağlamak ve kullanımı sürdürülebilir hale getirmek için bu sistemlerin
tasarımı önemlidir. Ancak, var olan sohbet aracısı tasarım kıstasları sohbet aracılarının
ticaret özelliklerine odaklanmış durumda ve sınırlı sayıdadır. Hâlbuki sohbet
deneyimi, kullanıcı bağlılığını ve insanların öznel iyi oluşlarını sürdürebilmek için
tasarımcıların asıl odağı olmalıdır.
Bu araştırmanın amacı sohbet aracılarının kullanıcı bağlılıklarını sürdürmek ve bu
aracıları tasarlamak için kıstaslar oluşturmak için insanların öznel iyi oluşlarını
geliştirmeye odaklanan sohbet aracılarının tasarım özelliklerini keşfetmektir. Bu
gayeyle, kullanıcılarla mülakatlar yapıldı. İnsanların öznel iyi oluşlarına katkıda
bulunmayı amaçlayan bir sohbet aracısı olan Woebot bu çalışma için konu olarak
seçildi ve 16 katılımcı tarafından değerlendirildi. Katılımcıların yorumları, yarı
yapılandırılmış ve detaylı mülakatlarla elde edildi. Çalışmada, mülakatların sonuçları
değerlendirilerek, çekicilik, açıklık, etkililik, uyarıcılık, güvenirlebilirlik, verimlilik ve
orijinallik bakımından sistem operasyonları ve işlevselliğine ilişkin geliştirme
önerileri sunuldu. Son olarak bu çalışma, kullanıcının bağlılığını ve tüm deneyimini
nelerin önemli biçimde etkilediğine dair içgörüleri sağladı.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background of the Study
System’s functionality, ease of use, its aesthetic attributes and performance has always
been the central qualities for user interface design in terms of its usability (Mayhew,
1999). With the emergence of personal computer, usability is the major concern of
developers of such systems. The first personal computer was developed by IBM
(Queen and Korn, 1984). To operate the computer, the keyboard was used to type
commands to a black computer screen as a form of interaction, which is called
Command Line User Interface (Jacob et al., 2008). At that time, users needed to be
trained on how to use the computer, thus they considered as experts on computer
usage. After 1980s, personal computers became popular; as a result, the number of
computer users had increased and usability considerations started to appear since
target user population was widened (Leed, 2000). It was hard for untrained user to get
used to Command Line User Interface, so there needed to be a shift in the interaction
paradigm at the time. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) has ‘enrolled’ into the
systems with its graphical metaphors. The metaphors were to ease the interaction by
making the interface more understandable and more intuitive to use (Myers, 1988).
However, there was still a need for mediums to interact with the system such as
keyboard and mouse. With the advancements in technology, this interaction started to
become more intuitive and direct; that is, such mediums are now becoming obsolete
if we consider interfaces such as touch screens and gestural interfaces, which are
considered as Natural User Interfaces (NUI) since the interaction does not need to be
mediated and more direct, thus the user does not require prior training and intuitively
use the system.
1
Figure 1-The Evolution of User Interfaces (retrieved from chatbotsmagazine.com)
Figure 1 summarizes this evolution by highlighting the key interaction paradigms. As
a prominent interaction modality for NUI, voice -or more generally- conversation has
entered into current interface paradigms, which allows users to use products or
services in the most natural way as possible, by just talking with them.
With the technological advancements, many products such as smartphones and home
appliances in smart home systems are now capable of interacting with the users via
natural language and this way of interaction is named as ‘Conversational User
Interface’ (Moore, 2018). Thus, this new user interface enables user to interact with
the interface through conversation. Moreover, using conversation as the interaction
medium, Conversational Agents, such as Apple’s Siri, Google Now, Amazon’s Alexa
and IBM’s Watson are becoming popular.
“Conversational agents exploit natural language technologies to engage users in text-
based information-seeking and task-oriented dialogs for a broad range of applications.
Deployed on retail websites, they respond to customers’ inquiries about products and
services. Conversational agents associated with financial services’ websites answer
questions about account balances and provide portfolio information” ( Lester et al.,
2004, p.2). These agents have the potential to be used in healthcare related systems as
digital assistants (Riccardi, 2014), and they can provide companionships or even
replace the customer representative.
Conversation User Interface in healthcare has created two main potentials for
Conversational Agents. The first potential is maintaining the availability of qualified
healthcare services for those have limited access to such services. Second one is
2
enhancing the accessibility of traditional or modern psychological support services,
which are not easily affordable by the majority (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017). In addition,
when consulting current psychological support services, sharing personal and private
matters with a stranger can cause people to feel insecure. On the contrary, with the
help of domain specific Conversational Agents, people may feel free to share their
stories with their artificial “therapist” in the form of a Conversational Agent. For
instance, IBM’s Watson offers ‘cognitive healthcare solutions’ for people. IBM’s
Watson is supported with effective Natural Language Understanding, efficient
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to provide “help” for its users (High,
2017). If designed effectively, such services can potentially provide benefits for
subjective well-being of users and can improve their quality of life.
Conversation User Interfaces are not new to people. Characters in Sci-Fi movies and
series, for example Samantha in Her (Jonze, 2014) and Jarvis in Iron Man (Favreau et
al., 2008), have created an expectation concerning this type of emerging user
interfaces. While interacting with Conversational Agents, people expect intelligent
responses from high-tech products, which would impress them with their abilities.
However, the current conversational agents are not capable of meeting these
expectations, since the technology behind them has not improved that much as in the
movies. That is to say, it is hard for IBM Watson to provide psychological consultancy
services, which would meet the initial expectations of their users. For such cases,
interaction design solutions have critical importance to condition users that the
artificial intelligence behind these services have certain capabilities.
Shifting the interaction paradigm from GUI to Conversation User Interface cause user
interface designers to adopt different design strategies while developing the interface
for Conversational Agents, since current guidelines on designing interfaces that use
computer graphics is not applicable for this case.
Although there are many established interaction design guidelines for GUI1, for
Conversation User Interface, the existing sources are mainly focusing on developing
skills for specific conversational agents, such as Amazon Alexa, Google Now, IBM
Watson and Apple Siri, and they are usually focusing on specific aspects of these
3
agents together with a limited reference to generic guidelines on conversational
design. There are also a few general sources that a designer can consult while
designing the interaction2. However, their numbers are limited and they are not
focusing on the subjective qualities and impressions that a Conversational Agent
should evoke during the interaction. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate features
and qualities regarding user and Conversational Agent interaction, in order to ensure
that the communication established through these products is continuous and
preferable. In this study, the focus is on a domain specific conversational agent named
Woebot, which aims to support people’s subjective well-being.
1.2. Aim and Research Questions of the Study
The aim of this research is to explore the design qualities of conversational agents
focusing on improving subjective well-being, in order to (1) maintain sustained usage
and engagement with these agents and (2) propose guidance for designing them.
• How does user engagement can be maintained with conversational agents that
supports users’ subjective well-being?
Which design aspects and qualities do maintain user engagement?
o
What motivates people to sustain usage?
o
of the conversational agent to support user’s subjective well-being?
o
• How should a conversational agent be designed to support user’s subjective
well-being?
How should conversation be designed?
o
What are the qualities and features
o
1 There are general principles provided by guidelines from prominent authors, such as
Nielsen (1993) and Shneiderman (2004); there are international standards which focuses on
such guidelines, such as ISO/DIS 9241-16:1996(E); and there are styleguides for companies
such as Interface Guidelines for Windows and Apple.
2 Such as these books: “The Conversational Interface: Talking to Smart Devices (McTear et
al., 2016)”, “Designing Voice User Interfaces (Pearl, 2016)”, “Designing Bots (Shevat,
2017)”

1.3. Structure of the Thesis
The thesis has five chapters. Contents of each chapter are outlined below.
Chapter 1 explains the background of the study and study’s relevance to and
importance for the design discipline. Then the scope of the study, aim and research
questions of the study are presented. At the end of the chapter, the structure of the
thesis is described.
Chapter 2, related literature on positive psychology, user experience and interaction
design are presented as a background to this study. The importance of making use of
different literature backgrounds is to distinguish how different disciplines influence
the interaction design scope and also how it affects the changing user experience while
interacting with smart systems.
Chapter 3 explains the methodology of the research in detail. The data collection, the
steps of data collection, the procedure of the study and the measurement instruments
which are used for data collection are described.
Chapter 4 presents the results of the data obtained from the participants of the research.
First of all, the strategies and methods of the participants, which are used to improve
their subjective well-being, are discussed. Afterwards, the first system impressions of
the participants and after the first system interaction the perceived benefits and
limitations of the selected conversational agent are described. Then, the overall user
experience, the system’s attractiveness, pragmatic and hedonic qualities which are
retrieved from User Experience Questionnaire, are argued in detail. At the end of the
chapter, the possible system developments, interaction design related suggestions are
discussed.
Chapter 5 summarizes the thesis and evaluates the research questions of the study. The
proposed interaction design guideline is presented; the recommendations for the future
studies and the limitations of the present study are lined up.

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW
The study aimed to benefit from literature in two ways: first one was viewing the
studies which related to positive psychology, well-being and types of well-being and
the products; physical or digital, that support people’s subjective well-being. Positive
user experience related literature was also reviewed to understand people’s product
engagement patterns and decision making process regarding the digital product
engagement. Besides, interaction design, existing interaction and graphical user
interface design guidelines for digital products and design considerations of digital
products formed a basis for the gap in the related literature that was covered through
the study. In other words, psychology, Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and
product design related literatures were reviewed and this review provided a basis for
the thesis study.
2.1. Positive Psychology
Being positive in life enables us to perceive the events more and meaningful, and at
the same time this positivity increases the satisfaction towards people’s lives. For this
reason, people try to avoid feeling negative emotions or negative situations to maintain
the perceived positivity in their lives (Fredrickson, 2001).
As it has been understood from the previous psychology related studies, the main focus
of the researches were related with negative emotions, understanding the underlying
reasons of the negative emotions and negative experiences to break the negativity
chain (Seligman, 2004). However, in recent studies, there has been a shift in the
current research topics. Apart from understanding and identifying the negative
emotions and experiences, positive emotions are also considered as the side effects of
7
the events in people’s lives (Seligman, 2004). Since negativity related researches focus
on the weaknesses that they had bring into people’s lives and the solutions to get rid
of that negativity. However, the positive psychology related studies show that
positivity does not only search on the positive emotions but also the negative emotions
since to be happy both emotional states should be balanced (Sheldon et al., 2018).
The reason why positive emotions became important in psychology is to find ways of
increasing the quality of people’s lives. This would also affect the perceived
satisfaction of life. Correspondingly to the mentioned situation, the positive
psychology progressing on “the events that enables life to worth living” (Seligman,
2004).
Positive psychology tries to find answers regarding the things which would increase
the perceived quality of life. Furthermore, people are also searching for ways to
increase their awareness and pursue a life that has meaning. To help people, positive
psychology related studies try to measure the life satisfaction, merits of people, and
positive emotions in their lives, the engaging activities they prefer to perform, and the
accomplishments in their lives. According to Seligman (2000), negative emotions
cause people to disengage, leave or isolate themselves from that happening; however,
positive emotions are leading people to engage those happenings which brings happy
moments in their lives and their loved ones.
To accomplish tasks that bring happiness in people’s lives, people have pursued a life
full of accomplishments that leads them to feel satisfied over what they are doing, and
enjoy themselves. This kind of enjoyment is named well-being; accepting the life as it
is and feeling fulfilled with the current state (Lopez & Snyder, 2009).
2.1.1. Well-Being
The quality of life is an important factor in people’s life and affects their perceptions
over the events they have experienced. To extend the positive emotions and
experiences, positive psychology works on the factors that have positive affect on
people’s flourishing and well-being (Diener, 2009).
8
Psychology related literature shows that researchers on that area have different
opinions related to the dimensions of the well-being. According to Bradburn’s (1969),
well-being could be expanded by the positive emotions gaining an advantage over the
negative ones. This approach is Bradburn‘s ‘hedonic balance’ model (Schimmack,
2008). Alternatively, Diener’s (1984) suggested model of well-being includes
Bradburn’s emotional focus by including a cognitive element on the degree to which
people’s lives are calculated as satisfying. On the other front, Ryff’s (1989) asserted
model related to well-being expresses six dimensions that are proposed to be precisely
limited to the well-being related explanations of ancient Greeks and psychological
theories related to humanistic, traditional and existential perspectives (Ryff & Keyes,
1995). Keyes (1998); however, mixed Diener’s dimensions with Ryff’s dimensions
which was associated with the social health of a person. Apart from all the mentioned
well-being approaches above, Seligman (2011) developed a different model, named
as “flourishing” and with this the term “flourishing” was introduced to the literature
by him.
Seligman (2011) defines “flourishing” as the state where people experience positive
emotions, positive psychological functioning and positive social functioning, most of
the time. In more philosophical terms this means access to the pleasant life, the
engaged or good life and the meaningful life. In accordance with the “flourishing”
definition, Seligman also introduces a psychological model to enhance the flourishing
in people’s lives; the PERMA model. The PERMA model the flourishing and its
elements are closely linked with well-being. (The PERMA model is explained in more
detail in Section 2.1.2.1.)
Well-being is an important aspect of positive psychology since it is related with
people’s persuasion to reach their goals in life and being able to accomplish those
goals in their daily life. Well-being could be observed when people pursue their goals
in life and be able to accomplish them. These goals might be related with different
topics and expectations of people in their daily life basis or could be either personal or
social (Seligman et al., 2005). Due to these reasons well-being has been examined
under two main perspectives which are eudaimonic and hedonic (Keyes et al., 2002).
9
• Eudaimonic Well-Being Perspective:
Accomplishing personal improvement and having a meaning in life which enriched
with purposeful events that are agreeable with person’s values are labelled as the
eudaimonic well-being. The roots of eudaimonic well-being relies on Aristotle
according to positive psychology researchers because this well-being perspective is
associated with personal growth, meaning in life and having a perfectionist attitude in
life (Sheldon et al., 2018).
Eudaimonic well-being; in other words, is related with feeling delighted after
achieving an improvement in personal life, feeling happy and trying to reach further n
life by functioning well. In psychology related literature, this “functioning well”
dimension of eudaimonic well-being is matched with psychological well-being.
• Hedonic Well-Being Perspective:
Hedonic well-being on the other hand, is associated with living a life while
maximizing the happiness in it. This well-being perspective focuses on eliminating the
discomfort while promoting the comfort in life (Sheldon et al., 2018). While
eudoimonic well-being is related with “functionality”, the hedonic perspective refers
to the affective or ‘feeling good’ dimension of well-being.
According to Sheldon et al. (2018), subjective well-being is defined under the hedonic
well-being perspective.
The meaning in life, which mentioned under both eudaimonic and hedonic well-being,
could be examined in different terms of perceived life satisfaction. The life satisfaction
is one of the key dimensions of well-being and it could be either cognition based,
which refers to psychological well-being or both emotion and cognition based which
refers to subjective well-being (Zika and Chamberlain, 1992).
2.1.1.1. Psychological Well-being
Ryff (1989) defined eudaimonia with regards to achieving personal growth which
highlights “autonomy, positive relations, growth orientation, purpose, and meaning”.
10
Ryan and Deci (2001) stated that “there are three primary facets of eudaimonic living:
Pursuing intrinsic goals like growth, intimacy and community rather than extrinsic
goals like status, appearance and wealth; behaving in autonomous rather than
controlled ways; and being mindful and acting with a sense of awareness”(Sheldon et
al., 2018, p.2). Eudaimonic well-being is a part of psychological well-being since
people aim to pursue a life while being aware of their personal advancement through
engaging and meaningful activities cognitively.
These definitions have an impact on the definition of psychological well-being.
Psychological well-being is positive psychological functioning of the induvial
according to Ryff (1995). The terms in the eudaimonic well-being enable people to
pursue a life that satisfying them psychologically. In the time actualising goals and
expectations to chase the meaning of one’s own life, the activities or tasks are
completed while being aware of the consequences. To illustrate, doing sport regularly
leads to a healthy life. As a result, psychological well-being is fulfilled when people
function in accordance with their capability and potential to reach a meaningful life.
The term psychological well-being might be confused with the subjective well-being
since both of them are related with increasing the quality of life, life satisfaction and
having a meaning in life. However, psychological well-being is focused on the
activities that are performed consciously, whereas, subjective well-being is more
interested in emotions.
2.1.1.2. Subjective Well-being
The subjective well-being is associated with the overall life satisfaction (Diener,
1984). The researches on this topic are considered to be relate with positive emotions,
positive experiences in daily life context; also the reactions of people towards them.
As mentioned in the hedonic well-being perspective, both hedonic and subjective well-
being aim to increase the happiness while decreasing the pain in life.
According to Martin Seligman (2002), happy people have tendency to perceive events
more optimistically, remember the past more positively and perform more actively. In
other words, the expansion in positive emotions and happiness enable people to focus
11
on the positive side of the past and present occurrences rather than the negative ones.
With this, people can easily motivate themselves to reach their goals, increase and be
satisfied with the quality of their lives. On the other hand, having a subjective
perspective while deciding what makes a life that good for living is also counted as a
definition of subjective well-being (Diener, 1984).
In subjective well-being, the decision maker is the person him/herself that decides
whether he or she is pursuing a good life. To promote positive feelings in life, to enjoy
life as a whole and finding a meaning in life have a central importance in subjective
well-being. Furthermore, since evoked emotions might vary from positive to negative,
subjective well-being of people could also change in time. Subjective well-being does
not have to be stable, but the evoked negative and positive emotions should be
balanced to “feel good”(Seligman et al., 2005).
To measure the emotional reactions over life satisfaction, quite diversive measurement
instruments are developed. The measurement is important due to understanding of the
underlying reasons of subjective well-being and the benefit is finding different ways
and/or methods for promoting the well-being of people (Diener et al., 2009).
2.1.2. Methods for Improving Subjective Well-Being
There are various methods to improve subjective well-being; nevertheless, in this
study the PERMA model and coping strategies were covered due to being able to cover
more aspects of subjective well-being.
2.1.2.1. The PERMA Model
The PERMA model was introduced to the psychology literature by Martin Seligman
in 2011. Apart from its being a well-being approach, in this study the PERMA model
was used as a method for improving well-being.
In Seligman’s PERMA model, there are several aspects stated as to feel satisfied and
fulfilled, and scientific recommendations needed to be integrated in people’s lives
12
(Seligman, 2000). In PERMA model, each letter points to an aspect of subjective well-
being. To illustrate, P is for positive emotions, E is for engagement, R is relationships,
M is meaning in life and lastly A is the accomplishment. If people increase these five
elements all together in their lives, they would live a healthy life.
Figure 2- PERMA model ( retrieved from https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/perma-
model/)
Positive Emotions (PERMA), is linked with maximizing the positive feelings and
accommodation in people’s lives. The positive emotions are important to empower the
people interpret their lives more positively.
Engagement (PERMA) is obtained from the activities that supports subjective well-
being. To illustrate, cooking, drawing or doing sports increase the positive emotions
while engaging with an activity.
Relationship (PERMA), stands for the quality of the relationship between a person
and his/ her loved ones. Having a positive relationship with them stiffens the positive
feelings.
Meaning (PERMA) is the most crucial aspect of the model because without a meaning
in life, trying to reach happiness loses its importance.
Accomplishment (PERMA) is related with reaching the setted goals in life. For
instance, working for a good career and as a result of that hard work accomplishing
the goal lead people to feel fulfilled and happy.
As mentioned above, the purpose of positive psychology is to measure happiness and
in accordance with the measurements bring positive emotions and experiences into
people’s lives. The PERMA model enables people to improve their current state and
remain the positivity in their lives.
13
2.1.2.2. Coping Strategies
The coping strategies are connected with the actions and responses of people under
stressful situations (Lazarus, 1992). Moreover, coping strategies also addresses the
efforts of people to manage stressful circumstances. The context of the stressful
situation may vary from personal to social; nevertheless, apart from its context, the
characteristics of that situations determines the strategies that people develop in order
to overcome these circumstances (Folkman et al., 2000). As a result, a person might
try to handle the situation by changing the source and/or the meaning of the problem
in accordance with the evoked emotions at the end of the experience (Carver et al.,
1989).
Trying to cope with the source of the problem refers to the “problem focused coping”
whereas trying to change the meaning of the negative experience with the evoked
emotions refers to “emotion focused coping”. The sub categories of the “problem
focused coping” are taking direct action, planful problem solving, suppression of
competing activities, restraint coping and seeking social support from the loved ones.
On the other hand, positive reinterpretation, focusing and venting emotions, mental
and behavioural disengagement, acceptance and turning to religion are the sub
categories of emotion focused coping (Yi& Baumgartner, 2004).
Table 1-Problem and Emotion Focused Coping Strategies (Yi& Baumgartner, 2004)
Problem Focused Coping Strategies Emotion Focused Coping Strategies
Taking Direct Action Focusing on and Venting Emotions
Planful Problem Solving Behavioural Disengagement
Suppression of Competing Activities Mental Disengagement
Restraint Coping Positive Reinterpretation
Seeking Social Support Acceptance
Turning to Religion
In our study our main focus, which is related to coping strategies, was to understand
how graduate students cope with the stressful and/or anxious situations and which they
developed to overcome these situations were examined.
14
2.1.3. Design for Improving Subjective Well-Being
Product’s design could enable people to engage with meaningful activities or empower
them to pursue a happier life. In product design related researches, how a design can
change people’s way of living and how design can increase the quality of life were
searched.
The design of a product as an enabler focuses on helping people with sustainable
solutions and fulfilling the needs via design (Desmet and Pohlmeyer, 2013). In design
literature, to promote positive user experience, several design approaches are
introduced. Each of those approaches focuses on different aspect of subjective well-
being. One of them is Positive Design Framework (Desmet and Pohlmeyer, 2013).
The Positive Design Framework contains three ingredients of subjective well-being
which are pleasure, virtue and personal significance. Design for personal significance
is associated with the positive emotions evoked from the personal goals or
expectations from life. A product could be a supporter when people are trying to reach
their goals. To illustrate, a designed prosthetic leg would enable people to be actively
involved in life. Design for pleasure tries to feed the positive emotions of people. With
the support of a product, the positive emotions may maximize while negative ones
minimizes. Design for virtue; on the other hand, is related with morality side of life.
The design for virtue affects the behaviours of people according to Desmet and
Pohlmeyer (2013). The mentioned framework aims to guide designers during the
design process.
15
Figure 3- The Positive Design Framework (Desmet& Pohlmeyer, 2013)
The framework could be counted as the basis for the positive design. The positive
design desires to make people happy and to remove the obstacles which prevents
people to reach happiness.
Subjective well-being improved through design could be achieved by designing
products that would shape the people’s experiences in a positive way. Since people
cannot buy a new product when they want to change themselves, changing people’s
behaviours as a consequence of a product usage would be more sustainable solution
(Hassenzahl et al., 2013).
There could be different design related approaches to shape the experiences of people
by means of supporting their subjective well-being. Some approaches might aim to
increase the positive side of the experience while others direct people to embrace life
with its aspects as a whole (Hassenzahl, 2008). Since subjective well-being is
associated with positive emotions and “feeling good”, the intention of positive design
is to empower people to feel good via product design (Dorrestijn & Verbeek, 2013).
To promote people’s well-being, design related studies have focused on ways to
achieve happiness. In product design, the researches have mostly connected with the
physical products whereas the design of digital products should also be covered in
scope of product design literature.
16
2.1.3.1. Physical Products
Recently, design, engineering and marketing departments collaborated during
processes of a product development to improve the expected user experience. Their
contribution to positive user experience to support subjective well-being has been a
popular research topic in positive design literature (Garrett, 2010). Apart from the
functionality and aesthetic appealing of a product, the elicited emotions and thoughts
also become important topics to search for.
Physical products become an important factor to evoke positive emotions during
product usage. To illustrate, personal trackers (e.g. Fitbit) encourages people to do
exercise, be more active in general and track people’s quality of sleep. With this
encouragement, people feel more motivated to reach their goal of being fit (Figure 3).
Moreover, “…musical instruments enable musicians to develop their talent, while
running shoes support the development of an athlete’s individual running technique.
Products can also remind users of their current goals, or symbolize the achievement
of past goals” (Desment & Pohlmeyer, 2013, p.9). Physical products, accordingly,
help people to achieve their goals and motives them to accomplish their ambition in
life.
Figure 4- Fitbit ( retrived from https://www.fitbit.com/versa)
Mobile phones today reserve a big place by easing the everyday activities of people.
The use of mobile phone support the subjective well-being through reshaping the
17
habits of the people. Furthermore, with the help of mobile phones, multiple tasks could
be completed with a little effort. For instance, while listening music, a message can be
send to a friend at the same time without a need for another product (Palen et al.,
2000).
Mobile phones also enable people to download applications to perform different tasks
and engaging activities. Those activities could play an important role for subjective
well-being improvement (Karapanos et al., 2016).
2.1.3.2. Digital Products
At the beginning, the mobile phones were used for communication; however, they
have evolved towards more mobile, adjustable and customizable products (Goggin,
2007). The wireless technology helped them to be used for playing games, video
sharing, leisure activities, flirting and work related activities (Chan, 2013). Moreover,
as it is understood from the usage shift, the obtained usage flexibility and the
applications that iterate the flexibility, decreased the effort for daily activities while
increasing the quality of life (Essoussi & Merunka, 2007).
2.1.3.2.1. Applications
Mobile applications allow people to access services which increase the quality of their
lives. To increase the quality, more applications stated to submit purposeful and
engaging ones from the application stores in different operating systems such as Play
Store in the Android operating system and App Store in IOS operating system.
(Sandstorm et al., 2016). However, since the number of available applications for
downloading are drastically increasing, the competition and getting the attention of
the people among others have become a challenge for them.
People today have at least four of the most used applications in their mobile phones
and they got used to have feedbacks from those applications (Griauzde et al., 2018).
It could be concluded that people would adopt more preferable applications for
18
themselves since it is hard to find and download most of the application from the
crowd. In other words, most of the present applications become invisible for people
and grabbing the attention of people out of many got difficult (Tarute et al., 2017).
Users; however, gained consciousness over time with the increased familiarity and
became aware of their expectations from an application (Tay and Diener, 2011). This
conscious behaviour of users affected the application preferences. According to Unal
et al. (2017), people’s awareness has a positive effect on the application preferences.
Since people try to promote their subjective well-being through engaging activities,
the applications they have on their phone could also be included in the mentioned
engaging activities.
To support the increasing interest in subjective well-being, diversified applications are
now available. The context of the application that aims to support people’s well-being
vary between mediation to noting events that make people feel gratitude. For instance,
‘Smiling Mind’ application, which is available for Android and IOS, aims to help
people to expand their knowledge related to the term ‘mindfulness’, and help them to
overcome the stressful moments by the mediation; moreover, it provides exercises for
a healthy body.
Figure 5- Smiling Mind Application (Retrieved from
https://www.harnessprojects.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sm-blog.png)
19
‘Stop breath and think’ application is also designed for guiding people in regards to
mediation, to come through anxiety, depression or stress related problems. The
application provides different mediation audios which last between 2 to 20 minutes
(“stopbreathethink”).
Figure 6-Stop, Breathe and Think Application (Retrieved from
https://www.stopbreathethink.com)
Apart from increasing the positive emotions by mediation, context related to fitness is
also popular on the application stores. For instance, ‘Freeletics’ is one of the most
popular application that is downloaded from Google Play Store (Schneider et al.,
2016).
20
Figure 7-Freeletics Applicaiton (Retrieved from https://www.designrush.com/best-
design/freeletics)
Figure 8- My Gradititude Journal Applicaiton (retrieved from
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-gratitude-journal/id1164553256?mt=8)
Besides the mentioned application contexts, the ‘My Gratitude Journal’ enables people
to remember what they are grateful for through note taking. The developers of
application state that remembering those moments by taking notes would increase the
positive emotions of people (“itunes”). However, all of the four applications are paid
services. Thus, to make the applications more preferable in app stores, the interface
design of the application should be designed in accordance with operating systems
(Bhandari et al., 2017).
21
On the other hand, The Facebook Messenger and/or WhatsApp application could also
affect the subjective well-being of people. The conversational agents, which could be
either an application or embodied in another existing applications can promote the
subjective well-being of people (Riccardi, 2014).
2.1.3.2.2. Conversational Agents
The developing form of interaction system which is becoming progressively integrated
into the instant messaging applications or either having an independent application are
labelled as Conversational Agents (CA), (Luger&Sellen, 2016).
For Conversational Agents, there has been diversive definitions in the literature.
‘Conversational agent’, ‘Chatterbot’, ’chat agents’, ’digital agents’, ‘conversational
interfaces’, ‘chatbots’ and various more names have been given to such systems. Apart
from conversational agent which is the most used term in the recent studies, ‘chatbot”
is the second most preferred term. The difference between the ‘conversational agent’
and ‘chatbot’ is having a memory or not just imitating the human to human
conversation. (Luger&Sellen, 2016). Conversational Agents can perform tasks
whereas chatbots cannot. Moreover, since the creators of Woebot, the selected
conversational agent in the study, is defined as a Conversational Agent, therefore the
term conversational agent is used in thi study.
2.1.3.2.2.1. Evolution of Conversational Agents
The history of conversational agents goes back to the 1960s and the first CA was
named ‘ELIZA’ which was created by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966. The purpose of
ELIZA was to help people whom have psychological disorders while acting as a
therapist (Klopfenstein et al., 2017). Since its development, ELIZA has played an
important role in the evaluation of conversational agents.
The second famous conversational agent was ‘ALICE’. ALICE (Artificial Linguistic
Internet Computer Entity) was developed by Richard Wallace in 1995. The difference
22
between ALICE and ELIZA was ‘the natural language processing’ according to
Shawar&Atwell (2007). Apart from ELIZA, ALICE was able to carry out more
refined conversations with people (Dale, 2016).
The achievements ELIZA and ALICE brought into the conversational agent
development played an important role in the creation of the new CA’s which are
blended with new technologies. To illustrate, Siri, Alexa or Google Now are embedded
into the smartphones to help people to carry out intended tasks by the users (Shevat,
2017). With the help of technology and Artificial Intelligence integration to such
systems, now it is possible to find different type of conversational agent to carry out
different tasks. In 2011, newly emerged conversational agents became distinguishable
with the technological advancements for people. For instance, Apple’s Siri, Google
Now and Amazon’s Alexa become popular conversational agents among users.
Apple’s Siri has gained interest in 2011. After Siri, Google Now has been introduced
to the users in 2012 and Amazon’s Alexa followed them in 2014 (Lopez& Guerrero,
2017). All of these three conversational agents interact with people by using natural
language. Each of the mentioned conversational agents try to perform diversive tasks
which asked via voice commands. To illustrate, Siri tries to answer the questions that
people asked to her and performs the tasks by giving answers in natural language
(Figure 9). Google Now has an access to other services; as searching for a flight ticket,
finding the most suitable route from Google Maps, organizing the calender, in order
to assist the user (Figure 10), (Lopez& Guerrero, 2017).
Figure 9- Apple's Siri (retrieved from www.phonearena.com)
23
Figure 10- Google Now (retrieved from from http://blog.i2fly.com/?p=2183)
Amazon’s Alexa can also perform tasks as playing music, search for news; in addition
to these, Alexa can connect to the smart home services to turn on the lights, lock the
door or turn o the television before users came into their houses (Lopez& Guerrero,
2017). Different from Apple’s Siri and Google Now, Alexa have an access to the smart
home services (IoT) to perform pre-commands of the users.
Figure 11- Amazon's Alexa (retrieved from www. chatbotsmagazine.com)
24
The difference between Alexa and the other two conversational agents is having a
body. Alexa has its own application; however, Google Now and Apple Siri can
perform in an existing system or a service. In other words, while Alexa has its own
body to perform tasks, the other two conversational agents have to be embodied in
certain systems to perform tasks. Having a body or not changes the ways of
performance of the conversational agents and due to this change in operation the
conversational agents are divided into different groups.
2.1.3.2.2.2. Types of Conversational Agents
The conversational agents could be used for business purposes to initiate a task, or
could be created to perform as a personal assistant, the CA could be either “domain
specific” which operates only specific services. Additionally, the conversational
agents can be created in order to support personal growth and well-being while
entertaining people as consumer oriented CA (Shevat, 2017).
There are two main types of conversational agents; embodied and disembodied
conversational agents. There are similarities and differences between the stated CA
types. Furthermore, the areas of usage vary from one to other. Embodied
conversational agents have characters, mostly animated, which enable them to imitate
human like gestures during conversations. The graphic instruments eases to regulate
via text or voice by using facial gestures in virtual environment (Cassell, 2000). On
the other hand, disembodied conversational agents do not have their own graphical
elements to express human like expressions. In addition to not having their own
graphical instruments, disembodied conversational agents are mostly supported by the
instant messaging applications (Araujo, 2018).
The differences between embodied and disembodied conversational agents are the
communication type and being able to express gestures, hazes, facial expressions.
25
2.1.3.2.2.3. Interaction Design Considerations of Conversational Agents
The embodied conversational agents are also supported from the smartphone’s
operating system. For instance, Apple’s Siri and Samsung’s Bixby perform as personal
assistants. The disembodied conversational are supported by one of the most used
messaging application; Facebook Messenger (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017).
The advantages of being supported by an existing application are using the same
interface design elements of that app and being easy to notice that such conversational
agents is created when comparing with having its own application. The advantage of
using the existing application’s graphical elements have not been designed to be able
to compatible with smartphone operating systems (Klopfenstein et al.,2017). (Figure
12) Another advantage is related with competition among the applications which is
being supported by an existing instant messaging application that increases the CA’s
possibility of being noticed by potential users (Klopfenstein et al., 2017). This
advantage is also important since people would be familiar with the interface of the
CA, which means the interaction and usage of system would be easy to people to use.
Figure 12- Provided Interaction Elements from Instant Messaging Applications
(Klopfenstein et al., 2017)
The interaction design aspects of conversational agents, both for embodied and
disembodied, are quite limited due to being a new research topic in the literature. In
recent studies, it is clear that there is not an interaction design guideline for
conversation design specifically. Existing conversational agent design guidelines are
26
mostly offering ways to understand business functions for commercial products
(Moore et al., 2017).
The most customized guideline suggestion for disembodied CA is proposed by Amir
Shevat in 2017 in his “Designing Bots” book. According to him, the conversational
agents should have eight main interaction elements. (Figure 10).
Figure 13- Conversational Agent Interaction Design Features (Shevat, 2017)
First one is “branding, personality and human involvement”. This aspect contains the
audience of the CA and with its name and logo it aims to reflect the personality of CA.
Second feature is being supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The AI plays an
important role in “natural language understanding, conversation management, image
recognition, prediction and sentiment analysis”. All these factors are crucial for an
engaging user experience; in addition, without one of them, the CA could not be able
to understand the users’ intentions. Not being able to understand the intentions will
interrupt the conversation management and predicting the appropriate output for the
user’s input.
27
The third feature is conversation which includes critical aspects of interaction design
regarding to the usage success of CA. The conversation aspects are “onboarding,
functionality scripting, feedback and error handling help and support”. The CA directs
users throughout the conversation to prevent errors by providing the necessary help
and support when users feel lost during the conversation. Moreover, having a purpose
is important for CA to relay information which is linked with the provided
functionality of CA.
The fourth one is “rich interactions”. The interaction elements of CA and ways of
interaction. Fifth features are “context and memory”. The context and memory CA
have indicates the difference between human to human interaction and CA- human
interaction. The sixth ones are “discovery and installation” which are related to the
initiation of a conversation.
The seventh feature is “engagement methods” that is helpful for the system attachment
and the final one is the “monetization” from the system usage. Apart from this general
design guideline for conversational agents, Amazon’s Aexa and IBM’s Watson have
also shared their design guidelines.
Alexa is (as mentioned above) Amazon’s conversational agent. The developer of
Alexa proposes Alexa Skill Kits to upgrade Alexa’s capabilities according to user’s
preferences. The proposed Skill Kit tries to empower the users by letting them decide
future developments on Alexa. In order to develop new skills for Alexa, the user needs
to decide what kind of skill (capability) is desired and how that skill will function, then
the user has to ask the decided skill to Alexa. After deciding and asking, the desired
skill would have been integrated into the Alexa’s system. Apart from asking Alexa to
integrate a new skill, for customized skill, developers encourage users to code the
desirable skill. Subsequently to design and built process, the new skills would have
been launched to the market (Figure 14- 15). On the other hand, IBM’s conversational
agent Watson’s creators state that Watson is a “deep natural language processing

IBM published the design aspects of Watson in 2012 to clarify which design aspects
are important while designing such systems (High, 2017). The design aspects of
Watson explained in six steps. The steps start with accessing the data and after that the
system “searches and finds” appropriate response. Then, the found data/response
should be analyzed to “build and train” model. The modelling step continues with
deployment the model for use and the final steps are monitoring, analyzing and
managing the designed and deployed model (High, 2017) (Figure 16).

The mentioned design guidelines for conversational agents are limited to their specific
domains. Being domain specific leads these guidelines to focus on business functions
apart from the expected user experience. To overcome existing limitations in design
guidelines, while designing conversational agents, designers could not find any
insights about the user’s expectations and thoughts related to conversational agent
usage.

CHAPTER 3
METHODOLOGY
This chapter reveals how and for what purpose the research is conducted. First of all,
the sampling of the research is explained. After that, how the data was collected for
this study is presented together with the materials used for data collection. Then, the
procedure of the study is explained in detail under data collection section. Finally, how
the data analysis performed is presented.
3.1 Purpose of the Research
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the interaction design elements that can be
considered as useful regarding the interaction design process of digital products with
artificial intelligence within a designated usage period. In this study, the specific usage
period of the selected CA was two weeks, which was designed as a longitudinal
research.
Long-term user experience is the whole usage process of a product, its subjective
evaluation and how the meaning of that product is perceived at the end of determined
usage duration. The longitudinal research was also important to observe the interaction
elements and system functionality affects over the long-term usage patterns and user
engagement (Kujala et al., 2013).
The primary technique that is used in this research is conducting following semi-
structured interviews, which is adopted for user profiling and understanding people’s
methods and strategies to improve their subjective well-being. A subjective evaluation
questionnaire for evaluating the interaction of the system, and at the end of the user
research period in-depth interviews are conducted to understand the overall impression
of system’s usage over time. The analysis of gathered data from the users provided a
31
basis for an interaction design guideline proposal. The overall research method is
provided a basis for the guideline that is proposed at the end of the research.
3.2. Sampling
The study was conducted with the graduate students from the Faculty of Architecture
in Middle East Technical University. The reason for selecting graduate students from
the same faculty and university is their potential of interpreting the conversational
agent’s perceived usability. The user experience would be interpreted by the people
who know how an engaging user interaction should be. As a result, the participants
have been chosen purposefully for their way of interpretation of the system’s
functionality features and the interaction elements in detail.
16 graduate students participated to the study in total. Five of the participants consisted
from the acquaintances and the other eleven people are friends of the participants. The
participants were selected in accordance with the convenience and snowball sampling.
Particularly, participants of the research has been selected from whom has been
accessed and the other participants were the ones whom have been selected by the
convenient participants.
People who are continuing to their graduate education are more prone to stress
(Misra&Castillo,2004). As a result, while researching how the interaction of a well-
being related conversational agent should support people, the participant’s
susceptibility to stress and their strategies to improve their psychological state were
important factors. The participants are chosen from graduate students between the ages
23 to 38. Eight men and eight women (16 in total) are selected from the Department
of Architecture and Industrial Design. The reason for purposefully choosing these
people, who are furthering their studies in similar areas, is because these people have
similar stress and anxiety situations.
Five of the participants (one man, four women) are from the Department of
Architecture; two of them are PhD students, three of them are Master Degree students.
The other eleven participants (seven men, four women) are from the Department of
32
Industrial Design. Out of eleven, five of the participants are PhD students, six of them
are Master Degree students. In general, nine out of sixteen are academics, four of them
are students, and three of them are industrial or interior designers. (Table 1 shows the
demographic backgrounds of the participants of the study and for preserving
anonymity of the participants, the current job status was not shared in the Table- 1)

3.3. Data Collection
Figure 17- Methodology Structure
34
To have a better understanding to analyse the user engagement process, the study takes
advantage of the Pohlmeyer’s “ContinuE” model. In the “ContinuE” model, a user
experience already starts with the anticipation of using the product, includes the use
experience itself as well as the reflection upon a use experience (Pohlmeyer, 2011).
Taking this proposed model as the model of this study’s user experience model, the
phases of study was determined as “pre-use”, “use”, and “post use” phases.
Figure 18- Pohlmeyer's model of Continuous User Experience ( Pohlmeyer, 2011)
3.3.1. Pre Use Phase
In the first phase of the research, the aim was understanding people’s strategies and
motivations to promote their well-being in their daily lives for user profiling. In order
to reach that aim, the digital assistants which offer psychological support; such as
conversational agents that support an existing messaging application (Woebot), was
selected. After that, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the participants
of the study. The interviews were conducted in a face to face interview in the same
venue.
The gathered data was analysed using the positive psychology related PERMA model
and coping strategies with the negative emotions. The participants’ first impressions
and statements regarding the first interaction were also included in the pre use phase
of the study.
35
3.3.2. Use Phase
In the second phase of the study, the aim was learning participants’ subjective
evaluations about the selected product. First of all, the most suitable subjective
evaluation questionnaire for the research was selected among the existing subjective
evaluation questionnaires. (UEQ)
The questionnaire was sent to the participants at certain intervals during the research
period. The questionnaire was filled out via e-mails. The aim of using a subjective
evaluation questionnaire was to understand the key points of related product’s usage
experience and the perceptions related to the system characteristics of the product.
Besides, the questionnaire usage enabled this study to link the product evaluations of
the participants and their understandings of the system characteristics.
3.3.3. Post Use Phase
At the end of the user research period in-depth interviews was conducted to understand
the overall usage evaluation of the selected product. The analysis of overall evaluation
of the product usage and perceived benefits/ limitations during decided usage period
was helpful to propose a guidience for an interaction design. At the end of this content
analysis, 1013 statements and 117 dimensions were retrieved. Statements refer to the
aspects from the participants’ comments.
3.3.4. Measurement Instruments
In total, two different measurement instruments were used during the study; one was
the Flourishing Scale and the other one was the User Experience Questionnaire.
Neither the scale nor the questionnaire were in the centre of the study as quantitative
data resources; however, the questionnaire played an important role while collecting
qualitative data related to the system’s usability and overall user experience. The scale
was a supportive actor for user profiling and the questionnaire was helpful in terms of
enabling participants to express their diversive thoughts regarding the overall CA
interaction.
36
The Flourishing Scale was used twice during the study. The first usage was at the
beginning of the first interview and the second was at the beginning of the second
interview of the study. On the other hand, the User Experience Questionnaire was used
four times during the overall research. The first UEQ was filled at the end of the first
interview, second UEQ was sent via e-mail five days after the first interview. The third
UEQ was also sent via e-mail on the 10th day of the study and the fourth and last UEQ
was filled at the beginning of the second interview.
3.3.4.1. Flourishing Scale
Flourishing scale aims to measure “the core aspects of social-psychological
functioning, namely purpose and meaning, supportive relationships, engagement,
contribution to the well-being of others, competence, self-acceptance, optimism, and
being respected” (Schotanus-Dijkstra et al., 2016, p.2). As it is defined in literature
chapter, subjective well-being consists of both emotional and cognitive appraisals of
the quality of one’s own life and in our study the Flourishing Scale was a supportive
instrument to understand participant’s perceived subjective well-being at the
beginning and end of the study.
The FS developed by Diener (2010) is widely used in well-being intervention studies
and clinical practice, due to its briefness, simplicity and comprehensiveness. More in
detail, the scale is composed of eight statements related to which participants
mentioned how much they agree or disagree by assigning a number on a Likert scale
( 1-strongly disagree, 7-strongly agree). So, resulting score can range from 8 to 56 and
the higher scores indicates the competence in participant’s life.
The Flourishing Scale has already been translated into 17 languages and measures of
Flourishing Scale were adapted into Turkish by Cihangir et al. (2003). The Turkish
version of Flourishing Scale was used in the study since the participants native
language is Turkish and to not to have a language barrier while expressing themselves
(Schotanus-Dijkstra et al., 2016).
37
3.3.4.2. User Experience Questionnaire
The User Experience Questionnaire is used for measuring conversational agent’s
perceived usability and overall user experience. The questionnaire is designed to
enable people to express their feelings, impacts and approaches towards the selected
“interactive product”. The scale has 26 adjective pairs which are selected to cover
extensive reactions of the user experience.
Figure 19- UEQ Measurement Aspects (retrieved from www.ueq-online.org)
In UEQ, “a data analytical” approach was used in order to ensure a practical relevance
of the constructed scales. The items are scaled from -3 to +3. Thus, -3 represents the
most negative answer, 0 a neutral answer, and +3 the most positive answer. Each
adjective item covers a definite quality aspect of an interactive product, system or
service. The adjective pairs have the form of a semantic differential, for instance, each
item is represented by two terms with opposite meanings. The order of the used
adjective pairs are random.
38
Figure 20- Responses to the Items of the Scale Perspicuity (Schrepp, 2017)
As in Figure 20, in some adjective pairs positive one placed at the beginning whereas
in the bottom pair the negative one comes first. Those distinct adjective pairs are
capable of evaluating selected conversational agent’s both negative and positive user
experiences.
The origin of the UEQ is in German which was designed in 2005 and it has translated
in 21 languages, including Turkish. However, in the study, English version of the UEQ
was preferred. The reason was, in the Turkish version of the UEQ, the measurement
items are difficult to distinguish from each other and also it was easier to express and
explain system quality related evaluations in English.
3.3.4.3. Selected Conversational Agent
Woebot was selected for this study to examine the user engagement with
conversational agents which aims to support users’ subjective well-being. Woebot is
developed to provide service for non-clinical populations (“Woebot”, 2017). Woebot
enabled these populations to have an access to psychotherapy related services with a
little effort and expense by using Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) framework.
The major reason of Woebot’s selection is the usage of CBT framework while
supporting users’ psychological state. The Cognitive Behavior Therapy is a kind of
psychotherapy which aims to change people’s way of thinking and cognitive patterns
to help them to overcome hardships in a short period of time (Andrews et al., 2010).
Moreover, besides CBT, Woebot consists of “emphatic responses”, “tailoring”, “goal
setting”, “accountability”, “reflection”, “motivation and engagement”.
39
“Emphatic Responses” are linked with the understanding the user’s mood and giving
responses in accordance with the stated mood of the user. “Tailoring” is offering
specific advices to the user depending on a goal in life and whether that goal would be
achievable within two weeks. (The conversation duration is two weeks for the trial
period of Woebot.). “Accountability” is related with agent’s memory related to past
conversations. Users would expect Woebot to remember past conversations and being
recommended the shared mood states or life goals in the fort coming interactions.
“Reflection” is sharing the weekly mood graphics of the user with an explanation to
show user how his/her mood has changed during the week. Lastly, “motivation and
engagement” are associated with sending personalized responses to each user to
initiate an engaging conversation (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017).
3.3.5. Procedure of the Study
At the beginning, a brief introduction related to the duration of the study, purpose and
procedure of the study is introduce to the participants. Then they were asked to sign
the content form of the study (APPENDIX B).
Firstly, the participants were asked to fill the Flourishing Scale to understand the
degree of their subjective well-being. After filling the scale, three questions were
asked. First question was about the previous week of the interview and whether the
participants experienced negative moments during that week or not. To help
participants to remember those moments, a calendar was used. Participants were
informed at the beginning of the interview that if they do not want to share the answer,
they could take notes instead. After remembering the negative experiences, their
strategies and/or methods were asked. The participants responded with explaining how
they overcome those moments and two of the participants stated that they did not have
a negative moment during the past week so the questions moved on to the general
strategies and methods of the participants to support their well-being.
To know the participants closely and to understand how open minded they are related
to the psychological services, repetitively stating that they do not have to answer if
they do not want, participants were asked whether they had seen a psychiatrist or
40
psychologist ever in their lives. Afterwards, after giving a brief introduction about the
conversational agents, they were asked whether they had previous or current
experience with CA usage. The answers to previous experience related question was
considered to be helpful for understanding the participant’s technology readiness level
and how easily they would accept the new technology in their lives. The personal
strategies and/or methodologies for improving subjective well-being, having an
external psychological support and previous or current CA usage were asked for the
user profiling of the study. The first phase of the first interview finished with user
profiling related questions.
The second phase of the interview started with a brief introduction about the
conversational agents, their types and purposes each participant verbally. The system’s
self-introduction, from own main web site, was performed subsequent to the verbal
brief introduction. To access the main system web page, a mobile phone was used.
From the screen, the participants were asked to view the Woebot and share their
opinions about the CA and how they perceive the system’s self-introduction. Apart
from voice recording, participants’ statements were written down to compare the
change in the opinions of the participants after the first interaction with the system.
The first interaction was performed during the first interview with the researcher.
Before the interaction, how to initiate a conversation with the Woebot was described
through the participants’ own mobile phones. First of all, the Facebook Messenger
application was opened, the name of the CA, Woebot was typed to the search bar and
the participants tapped to the Woebot’s profile from the search results. Three
participants did not have the application on their mobile phones so they downloaded
the Messenger application to perform the system interaction.
41
Figure 21- Woebot Conversation Initiation (retrieved from https://www.healthcare.digital)
After finding the Woebot’s profile, participants typed “Hi” to the CA and the
conversation had started. They were chat individually with the CA, only if they leave
the conversation by themselves and/or if the Woebot send “See you tomorrow” output,
the participants were asked to inform the researcher about the situation.
42
Figure 22- End of a Conversation (Screenshot)
With the end of the first interaction with the system participants were asked to fill the
User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) to evaluate CA’s usability and user experience.
Then in response to the question asked, they stated their thoughts and feeling towards
their first conversational agent interaction. Moreover, they compared how their first
impression had changed after conversation. Before finishing the interview,
participants were reminded that after five days over the first interaction, the second
UEQ would be shared with them via e-mail or Google Documents and after another
five days over second UEQ, the third UEQ would be sent to them again via e- mail or
Google documents. They were asked to inform the researcher if they want to leave the
study.
Five days after the first interview, the second questionnaire was sent with a prompt
message. The same process was repeated for the third UEQ. After ten days of
43
interaction, a message was sent to the participants to decide a day for the last interview
of the study.
On the 15th or 16th day of the study, on the agreed day, the in-depth interview was
conducted. At the beginning of the second interview, second Flourishing scale was
filled by the participants to investigate whether Woebot interaction had an impact on
their subjective well-being or not. The first results of the FS were compared with the
second ones, in case of an incensement or decreasement, participants were asked if
Woebot had a negative or positive impact over their well-being. Then the last UEQ
was filled before examining the given answers in detail.
The second interview continued with comparing the each 26 item of UEQ from the
previously filled four of the UEQ in detail. The aim of the comparison of the filled
questionnaires is to understand the underlying reasons of participants’ evaluation of
the Woebot’s characteristics, functionality and personal traits and how those aspect
affected the overall user experience. In addition to UEQ results comparison, the
participants were asked to answer which CA aspect or aspects they liked the most and
least, the reasons why they chose the stated aspects of the system. Finally at the end
of the interview, the future Weobot system, service and interaction related
developments were stated by the participants as an answer to the “how the CA should
be improved in accordance to you/ your experience?”.
The obtained data from each participant through interviews and surveys were started
to be analysed after finishing the 32 interviews.
3.4. Data Analysis
This section covers the data analysis procedure for the obtained qualitative and
quantitative data. The quantitative data assisted the study while understanding how
participants’ evaluations had changed during the use period of the study. Moreover,
the gathered qualitative data played an important role in proposed interaction design
guideline.
44
Qualitative data analysis started with the transcription of the voice recorded interviews
after each interview had finished. 16 participants attended to the study and for each
participant, two interviews were conducted; one at the beginning of the study and one
at the end of the study. In total 32 interviews were transcribed with the aid of Microsoft
Word software. The transcribed interviews were transferred to the Microsoft Excel
software to start coding.
The raw was data transferred in the order of the UEQ measurement items. After
transferring, the raw data was carefully read to categorize evaluations whether they
are related with personality traits, system functionality or interaction quality. The
decided categories were written down to the first column of the Excel Sheet.
Subsequent to the categorization, the attributes were decided. Then the related values,
an appropriate adjective, which is used to describe the emotional state, were written
as value of the stated attribute.
While constructing the categories, attributes, and the values the inductive coding
approach was used (Saldana, 2016). In inductive coding approach, codes are emerged
from the collected data. The codes are interpreted after reading the collected data in-
depthly. As mentioned, the categories and attributes were derived from the
participants’ evaluations. On the other hand, most of the value codes are retrieved from
the UEQ adjective pairs, since in-depth evaluation questions were from UEQ.
After determining the codes in the first cycle, the analysis continued with “assigning”
the repetitive interpretation affect the subjective evaluations of the participants to
initiate how perceived attributes changed, how repetitive interpretation affect the
subjective evaluations of the participants. As for the second cycle coding the selected
attributes’ consequences were created (Saldana, 2016).
45
Figure 23- A Screenshot from the Coding File
In second cycle, for instance, “Lengthily explaing the chat subjects” attribute’s
consequence is “Excessive response length”. After creating that consequence, the
created consequences were linked with the values, “Annoying” or “Cluttered”.
Following the mentioned analysis steps helped to understand how participants
interpreted the system’s excessive response length as being not annyoing. Subsequent
to finishing coding, similar interpretations or similar connotations were combined or
rephrased.

CHAPTER 4
RESULTS
4.1. Methods and Strategies for Improving Subjective Well-Being
The strategies that have developed to improve subjective well-being by the
participants are related with both the negative emotion coping strategies and positive
psychology related PERMA model.
4.1.1. Strategies Related to Improving Subjective Well-being based on PERMA
Model
PERMA model is Martin Seligman’s model of happiness which aims to help
researchers to analyse and understand the aspects in people’s lives that increases the
possibility of reaching a life of full happiness. The model was designed with five
elements of psychology related well- being and happiness. Seligman believes that
these five elements would help people to reach a life of fulfilment, happiness and
meaning. In accordance to his belief, it can be conducted that well-being is a
combination of thinking and feeling good at the same time. To express how important
this is and how people could improve their subjective well-being, Martin Seligman
introduces the PERMA model. PERMA model consists of five elements; positive
emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning and accomplishment.
Positive emotions in the model are linked with being optimistic and perceiving life in
a positive way by establishing better relationships with people (Seligman, 2011). To
increase positive emotions in their lives, participants stated that they prefer to have a
good relationship with their family and friends which enables them to strength their
social connections. To illustrate, a participant (P13) stated that he/she prefers to visit
his/her hometown to fulfil his/ her longing for missed friends and family. In addition,
47
eating quality food is also one of the strategies marked by the participants to increase
the positive emotions in their lives. (P08)
Engagement is concerned with being able to find the activities that make people feel
happier, fulfilled and complete. In the study, these activities are associated with
hobbies of users that enable them to be more engaged with life when they feel down.
In those circumstances, Participants prefer to do sports to have better physical health.
Moreover, doing relaxing activities such as cooking, drawing, listening music, playing
a musical instrument and relaxing with physical activities helped participants to
improve their emotional state. These engaging activities deploys participants’
concentration, skills and strength for challenging tasks as P06 states;
“I mean, I dance. I tried to feel good by doing an event such as going dancing
and get discharged. I try to formulate a strategy to forget things by physical
activities such as sports which is generally dancing for me.” P06 [1]1
Relationship in PERMA model is linked with the experiences that contribute to well-
being which could give purpose and meaning to the people’s lives. In the study,
participants stated that they did not prefer to be alone and they prefer to spend time
with their loved ones to feel better. Spending time with other people enables them to
enjoy the moment and provides a meaningful life. On the other hand, according to
participants, the reason why they do not prefer to be alone is not to let themselves to
focus on the problems by over thinking. Meeting or spending time with their friends
and family also enables them to distract their attentions from the problems. According
to the participants’ comments, they did not have any methods or startegies related to
Meaning in the PERMA model.
Accomplishment in the PERMA model related to having goals and ambition in life can
help people to achieve conditions that can give people a sense of accomplishment. The
participants’ strategies regarding accomplishment are related to having a goal, such as
working for a good career (P04) and organizing daily life by doing sports (P13), which
gives the participant a sense of accomplishment and fulfilment.
1 For the Turkish versions of the participants’ direct quotations see APPENDIX E
48
4.1.2. Coping Strategies
When people feel down, they tend to overcome the negative situation, they usually do
not prefer to act as if nothing has ever happened. To overcome these situations, they
adopted certain strategies. These strategies that participants stated during the
interviews were associated with “Emotions Focused Coping” and “Problem Focused
Coping” strategies as a result of the analysis. The strategies shared by participants are
mental and behavioural disengagement, seeking social support, acceptance,
confrontive coping and planful problem solving.
4.1.2.1. Mental and Behavioural Disengagement
People who have had negative experiences might prefer to forget the negative
experience by doing distractive activities to take their mind off from the experience or
refuse to believe that something has happened. In addition to this denial, people might
also try to distance themselves from the problem or they may try to rescue themselves
from the problem by giving up further action. In these strategies, it can be concluded
that, people believe that this is the situation and nothing else can be done to fix the
negative experience. Accordingly, for such situations, participants stated that they try
to not to think the problem over (P12) or prefer playing computer games and read
fantastic fiction to escape from reality (P02). Moreover, to distract themselves, apart
from playing computer games, they watch Television, listen to “bebop”. One
participant stated that he/she prefers to be alone to take weight off his/her mind. This
coping strategy also includes isolating oneself from the world, to illustrate, to achieve
that P14 do mediation or P15 watches movies that do not require to be focused on
deeply to understand. To not to think a problem over, P09 said that he/she paces up
and down to keep himself/herself busy. It is also stated that meeting with friends also
enables participants to not to focus on or to think the negative experience over. P11
stated that he/she tries to adapt a strategy which is focusing on not moving and thinking
nothing for five minutes to relieve himself/ herself.
49
“I have read a book about concentration techniques. It was saying that
focusing on one activity is better than doing many activities at the same
time to control your body. There were some techniques like not moving,
not moving at all for five minutes. It really makes me relaxed. I do such
activities. I mean I don’t move at all for 5-10 minutes. It is really hard but
it makes you relaxed tremendously. Moreover, you’re not having any
thoughts at all. You don’t think, you push yourself. This is extremely
relaxing. I do this activities. When I don’t do some of my body parts are
strained such as my legs, feet, etc. which bothers me. This thing also made
me obsessed with it.” P11 [2]
Avoiding television watching and spending excessive time on social media help P14
to feel at ease. Since these activities unable he/she to balance the time he/she spends
with her friends and family.
The difference between Mental-Behavioural disengagement and the Engagement from
the PERMA model is disposing the negative emotional state instead of resuming the
current emotional state. Engagement enables people balance the negative and positive
emotional state with engaging activities; however, disengagement is for coping with
the negative emotional states.
4.1.2.2. Seeking Social Support
To overcome negative emotions, people might prefer to be supported externally by
their loved ones. This external emotional support could be related with getting advice
from friends or family, telling them about the incidents to feel more relaxed after
sharing the negative experience with them. In this research, participants stated that
having a supportive and positive family relationships enables them to share their
experiences open heartedly with them. Furthermore, talking with friends to get their
opinion related to the incident, or socializing with their loved ones helps participants
to overcome the uncomfortable feeling they have.
The difference between Seeking Social Support and Relationships dimension in the
PERMA model is the purpose of the action. Seeking social support is to get loved
ones’ opinions;
50
“…talking with my beloved ones, having some time with them which helps me
to get over.” P16 [3]
However, Relationship dimension is mostly linked with having people around who
loves and cares the participant, and whom participants can laugh freely;
“Family relations such as supporting each other make me feel better. I texted my
family: ‘good morning my dear family…’ this morning to sustain these relations
with them.” P04 [4]
In other words, seeking social support is matched with overcoming negative incidents;
on the other hand, Relationship dimension of PERMA is about intensifying the
positive moments with the loved ones.
4.1.2.3. Planful Problem Solving
Planful Problem Solving strategy is linked with solving or reframing problems and/or
overcoming stressful moments by making plans. First of all, people need to understand
the problem to name the problem. After naming, the steps that are necessary to be
progressed to solve the problem should be decided and in accordance with the plan,
people should take action.
Participants’ comments showed that to run over stressful situations, they made plans
to organize their daily lives, and if the plan did not work they re-plan. Moreover,
seeing a psychologist regularly and trying to spare time to meet with their friends to
feel better enable participants, such as P14, to feel balanced.
The difference between Planful Problem Solving and Accomplishment dimension in
PERMA model is the context of the strategies. Planful Problem Solving strategy is
related with overcoming the stressful, negative moments by making plans;
“I re-plan to feel better. I mean I did good things to feel good but still I mean
this for the things that I wanted to but I couldn’t.” P11. [5]
On the other hand, Accomplishment is linked with pursuing an accomplishment to
feel complete and successful which at the end leads to a positive emotion;
51
“It might be investing to my career.” P14. [6]
4.1.2.4. Confrontive Coping
This emotion focused coping strategy aims to enable people to openly express their
feelings with the concerned people to deal with the stressful situation.
P07, P05 and P06 said that confronting with the person who made them feel offensive,
improved their emotional state by relaxing them. Moreover, four out of sixteen
participants stated that reframing their personal problems by confronting themselves
enabled them to feel better.
“Generally speaking, if I feel bad, if this is the question you ask, I try to solve it
myself. I would take myself off for couple of days. I wouldn’t see anyone. I
would cancel my social life and searching for solutions to my problem and solve
things that I can. For example, if there is a problem with my job, I wouldn’t thing
anything else for 3-4 days and try to think solution oriented.” P02 [7]
4.1.2.5. Acceptance and Positive Reinterpretation
Acceptance is valid for the situations that could not be changed. In other words, people
accepts that what happened and there is nothing in their hands to change this situation.
One participant said that he/she tried to see the positive side of the negative experience
by consoling herself.
(Not being able to receive payment for conference application) “What did I do?
I tried to console myself. That means I should not care too much. I learned that
I am going to a conference in Barcelona. I haven’t taken a holiday for a year. I’ll
go to there and do my presentation, I’ll wander around for 5 days, meet new
people. Then, I said it’s alright. This is it. I relieved myself.” P15 [8]
Furthermore, P02 stated that if the circumstance could not be changed, he/she prefers
not to care by accepting it as it is.
52
“If it is something that I can’t solve such as something that government did, I
don’t really care. It might make me unhappy and I still follow these news but I
don’t care.” P02 [9]

Accomplishment Having a goal in life
In conclusion, the most stated strategy is mental-behavioural disengagement to
comfort themselves. Avoiding, escape from reality or isolating themselves from the
53
reality is actualised by means of keeping themselves busy, being with their loved ones,
smoking or drinking alcohol.
After disengagement strategy, participants prefer doing engaging activities to intensify
the positivity in their lives. To illustrate, doing sports regularly for a better health,
focusing on themselves as self-care, preferring alternative shopping habits, drawing,
cooking, listening music or playing music instrument to relax.
The third common subjective well-being related strategies are seeking social support
and Relationship. Eight out of sixteen participants prefer to meet with their friends,
not to be alone, to comfort themselves with their social connections. In addition to
meeting, expressing feeling and thoughts related to the stressful situations to get the
opinions of the people. The same number of participants also stated that they spend
quality time together with their loved ones to strengthen positive moments.
Six participants face with the problem or related person to beat the negativity. On the
other hand, five of the participants organize their thoughts or make plans to solve their
problems via external psychological support, managing their personal times fairly for
the activities and for the people in their lives.
Four participants bring positive emotions in their lives by meeting their friends or
rewarding themselves with quality food. One participant tries not to care while another
participant accept the situation as it is by detecting the positive side of the negative
experience. (Table 3 shows the participants most preferred methods and strategies for
improving their subjective well-being)

4.2. User Engagement in Overall Evaluation-Longitudinal Research
The patterns of the participants and how they evaluate the overall usage of Woebot,
how people thought over the design elements of the CA are explained.
4.2.1. Flourishing Scale Related Results
There was a slight change in the average values of the first and second measurement
results of the flourishing scale as it can be seen in Table 4. Moreover, the participants
stated that the positive effect Woebot gives is some happiness in the moment of
conversation not afterwards or it has no effect to their perceived psychological state.
In other words, according to participants the increase in their subjective well-being
was independent from the CA usage. Therefore, based on these results, it is difficult
to draw conclusions on the results of the flourishing scale.

4.2.2. First Impression and Interaction Related Results
This part consists of the first impressions of the participants on the main web page of
Woebot and their impressions after the first interaction with Woebot.
4.2.2.1. First Impression of Woebot
The first encounter with Woebot was achieved via the main web page of the system
during the first interview with each participant. None of the participants had prior
experience with or knowledge about Woebot before the study, therefore, a brief
explanation related to the system was given. Afterwards, the disembodied
conversational agent were introduced to the participants, Woebot, which would be
their friend for fifteen days. (Figure 24)
Figure 24- Main Web Page of Woebot (retrieved from https://woebot.io/)
57
The opinions related to the self-system introduction were asked after showing and
letting participants to review the web page of the Woebot. (Figure 25)
Figure 25- Self-System Introduction from the Web Page (retrieved from
https://woebot.io/)
On the web page of the Woebot, it is stated that the system aims to track people’s
mood to illustrate the change in their moods with a graphic. “Give people insights”
which they might not be able to find on their own. “Teach you stuff” by recommending
techniques from the Cognitive Behavioural Theraphy framework. Promises to make
people feel better by sharing activities or enable them to freely express their feelings,
moods or thoughts with the system. Since the Woebot is available for 24/ 7, the people
could talk to the CA at desirable times. Lastly, Woebot’s developers stated that the
CA would extract data from the people’s inputs to improve the service.
At first, P16 stated that due to being inexperienced about the conversational agent
(CA) interaction, he/she could not believe as the interaction between a CA and human
would replace the human to human dialogue. Moreover, the participant also thought
that after interacting with the system, people may become isolated from the society
which would cause him/her to worry about future CA interaction.
“Would it feel same like a relation with an actual person? It might be. However,
it might make people anti-social, that’s another topic. I am already really
conservative about my friends, I am not eager to make new friends. I prefer to
58
continue with existing ones. I am still on some level about friendships but it
might make anti-social people even more anti-social.”P16 [11]
This worry leads an anticipation anxiety towards CA interaction. In other words,
participant had a concern whether the artificial interaction be able to meet the
expectations of him/ her towards expected interaction. On the other hand, P09 believed
that this type of interaction might reduce the dead time which is spent with a
psychologist in order to understand and reframe the personal problems. In addition to
this perceived benefit, participants stated that using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
Framework to offer psychologic state improvement would be helpful for people who
do not have an access to a clinical service (P05).
Accessibility of the conversational agent is evaluated as the system being helpful and
pleasing. Being accessible for an interaction at a desirable time could be a saviour for
people who need external support in case of an emergency.
“Being able to be with it 7 24 is an advantage because panic attack sufferers
might need it any moment even though I don’t consider myself as a panic attack
sufferer. You can talk with it any moment. For example, in an emergency, it
might say something like ‘take a deep breath’. It might make you relaxed and
let things go. It might do something good like these. It can be with you 7 24.
That’s a good thing. It might help you when you’re in depression or you are
having depressive moment.” P09 [12]
Offering psychological support based on specific strategies developed by scientists is
evaluated as system being reliable and favourable. However, P01 thought that the
system is disdainful since she misunderstood the intention of the conversational agent
from the superficial self-system introduction. The participant believed that Woebot
underestimates the usage of conventional therapy patterns while aiming to support
people. Due to superficial system introduction, P06 stated that purpose of the CA and
how the conversation between CA and people would progress are difficult to
understand. She could not evaluate the CA in terms of whether the interaction would
be beneficial or not.
Majority of the participants stated that Woebot would provide support for quite lonely
and people who are seeking for an external support.
59
“I think it might help in situations like being so lonely but I am not sure.”P07
[13]
From the main page of the Woebot, participants also stated their opinions related to
the information quality of the service. The most marked was mood tracking. Mood
tracking is perceived as an interesting instrument of the interaction. P03 said that mood
tracking would enable people to consider or analyse about personal problems or
negative experiences as a whole to overcome them.
“It had my attention because I liked the ‘track your mood’ feature. For example
if my mood is spoiled I generally think the moment but not the process or the
past. I like how it shows your mood weekly. I can say it attracted me.” P03 [14]
In addition to analysing personal matters, according to P12 it is beneficial to support
people’s psychological states by mood tracking. Furthermore, tracking people’s mood
with an Artificial Intelligence observed as the system being intelligent.
“I tried some app like this which wasn’t a bot. Real people reply you. It is called
‘Talk Life’. That one doesn’t control your mood. I liked how this track your
mood. I found it smart.” P14 [15]
The interface graphics of the service evaluated as easy to understand which system
developers consciously preferred to ease the interaction. On the contrary, one
participant (P10) evaluated this as a contradictory situation. P10 said that the system
promises to make sense out of the shared personal data for system development and
to improve people’s emotional states; however, the profile illustration of the CA
reminds him that its being a robot which caused him to perceive the system as being
contradictory.
Figure 26- Profile Illustration of Woebot
The participants stated the perceived benefits and limitations of “teaching stuff”,
“using CBT framework” to support people, being accessible for interaction at a
60
desirable time, tracking mood, their anticipation anxiety towards the Woebot, how the
system might lead people to be isolated from the society. Moreover, they evaluated
the self-system introduction as superficial due to not being descriptive enough related
to the system functionality.
4.2.2.2 Participants’ Impressions after First Interaction
At the end of the first interview, the first introduction with Woebot was conducted
after the system’s introduction from the web page. After introducing of Woebot from
its webpage, how the conversation/interaction with Woebot is going to be initiated,
explained to the users. Since participants were inexperienced about the conversational
agent interaction a brief introduction about how to start a conversation with Woebot
and what users should “do” at the very beginning of the conversation were by the
researcher. Thereafter finding Woebot via typing its name to the search bar,
participants tapped to the profile illustration of the Woebot and typed “Hi”. So the
interaction between the participant and Woebot had imitated. The participants’
evaluations are categorized under the following sections; ınteraction design related
aspects and user engagement related aspects.
Under the system quality sections, there are the accessibility of the shared data,
information security, the perceived artificial conversation, limited response options,
canned response options, how the system is perceived as a bad imitation of a human
to human interaction, interaction instruments of the system and its familiar interaction
platform. The use of the Woebot is evaluated in terms of accessibility of
conversational agent and Woebot led conversation initiation. The user impact
criticized with the system’s coded chat flow, engaging conversation, encouraging
conversation and its familiar interaction elements. Lastly, responsiveness of Woebot
is evaluated under the information quality heading/feature.

Syste m quality was measured in terms of ease of use, functionality, reliability,
flexibility, data quality, portability, integration and importance. Two of the
participants stated their concerns were related to the information security. Offering
psychological support via instant messaging platform/application which used quite
frequently caused to evaluate system as not secure by P08 and P09. Moreover, being
created by a well-known institution causes an interpretation related to the accessibility
of the stared personal data.
“Maybe it will suggest something because it is related with a university:
Stanford. Maybe they can reach a lot of people’s data. It says it will keep the
data secret but maybe they can reach anonymously. I don’t trust anyone about
the data thing. At the end we talk via Facebook. The data’s path is on Facebook.
I don’t trust Facebook at all. It is not a trustworthy company.” P08 [16]
62
The artificial conversation not being able to express the diversity of human emotions
during the conversation due to its non-human nature (P12). It is also perceived that
conversing with an AI is like having a virtual friend who offers psychological support
at the same time. Moreover, artificial conversation is evaluated as insencere on
account of mimicking human to human conversation while using predetermined
response options.
“…I don’t know I didn’t like it. For example, I said I will watch it later and it
replied ‘I am glad you liked it.’ That makes me suspicious. Then they might
have done an app that I can check strategies. If there is no real interaction I can
take care of myself. I found it insincere. They tried to make it look like it talks
to me but they couldn’t achieve.” P04 [17]
However, concerns related with it are whether conversational agent would succeed or
fail to do what it says it would achieve during the conversation causes to fail anxious
towards expected CA interaction.
“The goal is impressive. Cause is a good cause but does technology help people
in this topic? Is it trustworthy? If any emergency occurs, might it really
understand the importance of the situation? Would it react wrong or not? I am
asking this because it seems like it is developed for people who are in desperate
situations. For example, could it give a correct feedback for suicidal people? O
am not sure of that! I would call my relatives or friends in a moment of like this.”
P11 [18]
As it is stated, all of the participants were inexperienced related to the conversation
initiation and how to interact with such system, which user interface mediums were
going to be used during the conversations. After first interaction, P15 stated that using
canned responses to illustrate quick replies eases the expected interaction with the
conversational agent. While conversing with Woebot, tapping the most appropriate
quick reply option enabled an easy to understand usage of the system. On the other
hand, since the quick reply options were limited; three or more than four options were
not available at the same time, P11 stated that in consequence of canned response,
he/she could not being able to express his/her thoughts freely he/she did.
63
Using canned responses eases the interaction despite their disadvantages; however,
according to P10 Woebot forced him/her to give responses to the recommended
activities without offering alternative responses. Moreover, bot forced him/her to give
a response out of the offered canned responses to advance the conversation.
“I found the idea of texting with it very stupid. I mean it can be like this but
when it suggest only one option then I understand that it wasn’t really important
at all. I mean it is like asking if the music was good. ‘Was it good? Was it? Was
it?’ It will ask till you reply ‘yes.’ Look, ‘Was it?’s are coming. I would stop
talking to this if it was for myself.” P10 [19]
The forceful, dominant interaction of Woebot did not let user/participant to efficiently
participate to the conversation (P07). Woebot sends outputs quickly regardless of the
text length; however, sending system responses quickly unables participant to express
him/herself during the chat.
While having limited response options, trying to imitate natural human interaction led
Woebot to be perceived as repulsive. One participant stated the canned responses that
supported system/technology which is provided for the Woebot were quite limited,
which did not enable participant to freely express his/her thoughts. On the other hand,
the fact that participants were inexperienced about the conversational agent made the
experience more understandable.
Although a number of participants state that they could not be a part of the
conversation with Woebot, P15 perceived conversational agent as a tool to spend
his/her idle times. It is also stated that being supported from Facebook Messenger may
create a possibility of forgetting about chatting with a scripted conversational agent as
result of Woebot’s friendly the conversation more engaging. Moreover, offering
psychological support by extracting data from the participant via instant messaging
application is valuable. (P8, P13)
During the first interaction, the system operations aroused curiosity regarding the chat
flow, how the conversation between a human and a conversational agent would
engage/evolve. However, directing the conversation according to a chat script caused
one participant (P03) to evaluate that he/she is talking with a coded robot, not with a
conversational agent that has AI. However, it is believed that trough its script, Woebot
64
was directing the participant about how to converse with Woebot and how the
conversation will progress in the future chat sessions (P04).
Under the system quality, interaction instruments as canned replies and other options
evaluated as being inadequate. P14 stated that he/she could not type a response when
the suggested canned replies were not reflecting the participant’s thought/the response
he/she wanted to give during the conversation. Moreover, p04 believed that the
conversational agent does not offer enough response options during the conversation
yet the contact of each opinion was close to each other so the conversation between
than not being sincere. As it is understandable from the above participant evaluations,
the interaction instruments of the Woebot yet comprehensive enough to engage an
evolving conversation where participants could take place.
However, using an ordinary language made participants evaluate the system as it is
being friendly (P04, P11, P14). Being friendly with ordinary language usage also
formed with the notion as if conversational agent imitates human to human
conversation (P16). On the other hand, this system quality is also evaluated as dull
interaction. P01 thought that Woebot is a poor imitation of human to human
interaction.
“I mean it is like... I saw these quilts yesterday. They have printings of
knittings but it is obvious they are not knittings. I feel like that with this. I feel
unhappy when I see these situations.” P01 [20]
Moreover, one participant (P08) stated that he/she would not prefer to interact with
the CA before CA send him/her a prompt In other words, the participant did not
want to initiate a conversation with the Woebot. Also, conversing via text; in other
words, text based interaction created a disappointment (P13).
As the system promises to learn from the participants’ responses, P06 thought that
contributing to the system’s development through data sharing is related with system’s
user awareness. To get back to the issue of hand from the P06’s comment, the
information quality of Woebot is evaluated as unresponsive. P10 and P13 stated that
the system could not understand or analyze their inputs as Woebot’s coded chat flow
to make sense out of the shared data to produce custom responses for each participant.
65
In conclusion, after the first interaction with Woebot, the system quality is evaluated
in terms of information security, benefits of artificial conversation, limited response
options, “preferred” interaction instruments, forceful, dominant interaction of the
Woebot. Concerns related to system qualities caused participants to feel not secure,
anxious while sharing their personal data, also disappointed participants due to text
based interaction. On the other hand, system’s being entertaining and friendly aroused
an interest for the progressive conversations.
4.3. Evaluation of Woebot Based on UEQ Measures
The system is evaluated by the users as negative during the first and second interviews;
however, in the graphs below, there is no negative value in the survey results and the
adjective pairs are seen as neutral or positive.
“Woebot has created a slightly positive impression concerning Perspicuity, Efficiency
and Novelty, but is judged neutral concerning the other 4 scales.” Different from the
positive results, the participants did not positively commented on those scale related
adjective pairs each of which will be explained in detail in its own title.
Table 7- UEQ Results
UEQ Scales
Attractiveness 0,700
Perspicuity 2,279
Efficiency 1,078
Dependability 0,619

Novelty 0,885
Values between -0.8and 0.8 represent a neural evaluation of the corresponding scale,
values > 0,8 represent a positive evaluation and values < -0,8 represent a negative
evaluation. Hence, the participants had a slightly positive or neutral impression
concerning the user experience of the Woebot. The impression concerning the
pragmatic quality (Perspicuity, Efficiency and Dependability) is higher than the
impression concerning the hedonic quality (Stimulation, Novelty).

4.3.1. Attractiveness
Attractiveness of the system is related with how participants evaluated the overall
conversational agent interaction experience. The attractiveness “scale” consists from
six adjective pairs, which are; “annoying- enjoyable”, “unlikable- pleasing”,
“unpleasant- pleasant”, “unattractive- attractive” and “unfriendly- friendly”.

The participants evaluated the system related operations such coded flow of the
conversation, repetitive flow of the chat, repetitive questions, monotonous flow of the
conversation, underdeveloped system intelligence as annoying.
The coded flow of the conversation was interpreted as annoying by P10. According to
P10, the system forced him/her to give response to almost all outputs of the Woebot
to advance the conversation without having an opportunity to skip giving inputs. From
the interpretation, system’s coded chat flow was understood as invoking the system
actions in accordance with a script which was already determined. Moreover, P10
stated that the system did not give the outline of the conversation flow within the same
day, and did not inform the participant about the related to the topics that would be
generated through the conversations between Woebot and him/her.
“It is not adaptable. It has its own problems. I felt like it will make you act for
those problems. The fact that it is moving to another topics step by step made
me feel like they are like something that I can reach one by one and progress
myself. It might end up something like ‘Duolingo’ which is really annoying.”
P10 [21]
The repetitive system operations are evaluated as being annoying by P02, P12, P15.
According to P12, the repetitive system operations were linked with the system’s
coded flow of the conversation. P12 said that conversation between them continued
69
by repeating itself uniformly with the chat script while being unable to analyze his/her
inputs. P02 stated that Woebot asking questions repetitively was annoying and
disturbed him/her. In addition to repetitive questions, Woebot’s reminding itself
regularly for the interaction and sending prompts to the participants to initiate
conversations. P16, on the other hand, stated that the repetitive flow of the
conversation was neither annoying nor bad due to being able to converse in different
contexts.
During the conversations, the speed of the system outputs’ was quite fast independent
from the length of the messages (P15). Furthermore, it was also stated that sending
messages quickly emphasized that participants were talking with a robotic being since
people could not give responses that fast.
The speed of the message sending is understood as the system would not let the
participant to express himsef/herself to express personal thoughts during the
conversation (P13). The participant (P13) believed that not only this dominant manner
of the Woebot unable him/her to express himself/herself but also the system could not
understand and make sense out of the shared data as it was promised from the
beginning of the interaction.
P06 stated that Woebot did not achieve what it promises; while trying to support the
participant with a friendly manner without extracting important variables from his/her
inputs, the system also forced him/her to choose only one option from the offered
canned responses. Not having another response option, the participant had to choose
one out of the offered responses even if the context of the response did not match with
his/her thought. Similar to P06’s statement, P07 believed that the conversational
agent’s directive manner did not allow him/her to express himself/herself frankly;
however, this situation was neither annoying nor enjoyable for him/her.
“I mean I did find it neither enjoyable nor annoying or it is actually both. I told
you this in our first interview that I found it directive rather than creating a chat
environment that I involve. It is more like it is directing the chat which makes
me excluded. That’s why I neither got bored nor enjoyed.” P07 [21]
As the system dominates the conversation without letting participants to state their
thoughts freely, excessive notification sending and excessive length of the responses
70
did not allow participants to change the conversation context with a different one.
Moreover, it was not possible to block the incoming notifications. These two service
aspects annoyed P08 and P04.
“As I just said, you don’t want to see anything from outside or work with
anything when you feel bad. This runs into those moments and that’s why it is
annoying. A lot of notifications are coming and also it sends a lot of
notifications. I didn’t want to talk for a moment like the feeling of lonliness when
you feel bad. Maybe that’s why I said it is annoying. At the end, it doesn’t give
you a choice to shut the notifications. I could have said that I wanted to talk 3
days later but I didn’t. Maybe it would have understood. I think it has such
option.” P08 [22]
In addition to this service quality, according to P09, offering psychological support
through addressing thoughts, feelings, or behaviours inefficiently and monotonously
was resulted with a decrease in the anticipated curiosity towards the CA interaction
experience.
Figure 27- Not Being Able to Understand the Participants
71
Figure 28- Limited Response Options- Only one response option is suggested
The machine learning of the system is interpreted as underdeveloped. The system tried
to encourage the participant to perform non-technology related activities while not
being able to know the current context of the participants. P11 states;
“It has predetermined programme. It doesn’t reply what you said. It acts like you
are always in need of help or in a desperate situation. ‘There is such
techniques…’ said the bot like it was talking to a child. It was nonsense to write.
Even if I wrote ‘K’, ‘B’ or any random word it was going to continue anyway.”
P11 [23]
Moreover, the system is not able to extract necessary points from the users’ inputs.
System could not give a proper output for an engaging conversation since it could not
understand user. This “service quality” related aspect leads an understanding that
whatsoever the participants’ response is, it would not create a difference and the
conversation would continue to perform as it is scripted.
The system’s underdeveloped intelligence is matched with the “service quality” as
annoying and uninformative by P09. The system did not notify the participant about
the results of the completed tasks/recommended activities. Furthermore, the CA did
72
not convey an informative output to the user whether the activity was completed
successfully or not;
“Like I said before about the distortion part, it was the main activity for it and I
didn’t quite understand about writing without distortion. It doesn’t understand
me, too. I write something but it doesn’t exactly understand what I just wrote. It
seems like it won’t understand if I write ‘horse’ or my sentence. It understands
in holistically. It understands the thing it wrote with distortion but it doesn’t
understand word by word or the sentence structure. That’s why It shows what I
did, what I am doing but it doesn’t praise mine… I don’t understand anything.
Maybe that’s the reason” P09. [24]
Besides the mentioned annoying system and service aspects, system’s ordinary
language usage, instead of an academic language, perceived as enjoyable.

“Good-Bad” adjective pair was not directly evaluated with system operations, “service
quality” of the Woebot by the participants. Instead, the pair was linked with other
adjective pairs to clearly explain the overall user experience with Woebot. However,
the interaction with the system observed as dull, yet this was interpreted as neither
good nor bad. According to P13, the system interaction did not make a difference in
the participant’s life for better or worse.
73
“It didn’t make any good or bad in my life, as a change. I took adjective as a
good product and bad product. I mean it didn’t make any innovation as good or
bad in my life, it didn’t change my life any good or bad. For example, I didn’t
forget my passwords because I used it or it didn’t make my life perfect. As I
said, for example, I think something automatic directing such as navigation is a
good thing. I would increase ‘good’ for navigation because it directs you. Siri is
good, I mean. It is not 3 level good but it is 1 level. If it did something about
what I say it would be good. This is neither good nor bad. I think it is dull, I
mean according to me.” P13 [25]
For P07, offering psychological support via a familiar interaction platform is good.

System’s content insensitivity, dishonesty in onboarding and error handling attributes
are evaluated as unlikable, whereas repetitive conversation flow and dominant manner
of the CA are perceived as neither unlikable nor pleasing. On the other hand, system’s
canned responses, accessibility, and interaction related familiar platform usage,
74
deferrable responses and the system’s supportive and directive attitude of CA are
evaluated as pleasing aspects.
The system did not achieve what it promised by providing general surveys for user
profiling while it pretends to offer psychological support. For P04, this being dishonest
in system’s onboarding was evaluated as it did not acted upon the clearly explained
purpose of the CA at the first interaction. In addition to dishonesty, without being
aware of the participant’s whereabouts, intention or state, Woebot forced him/her to
continue the conversation.
“As I showed, I say I don’t want it and it says ‘let’s do it!’. Then I say let’s do it
and it says ‘Alright! I’m just sending you!’ I say I will try it later, and it says
‘Alright! I hope you like it!’.” P04 [26]
Figure 29- Context Unawareness of CA
For P13, Woebot logged in the same output during the conversation. While the system
repeating the same answer, it did not provide support or help to him/her to maintain a
smoother interaction with the system. Instead, the participant thought the system
stucked and whichever answer was given did not affect the Woebot’s outputs.
75

76
Although it has been stated that forcing users to give response during the conversation
to advance the interaction is annoying; nevertheless, P15 stated this type of interaction
is neither unlikeable nor pleasing. If the system could be context and user aware, P15
believed that Woebot would not force him/her to perform the recommended activities
immediately.
The pleasing side of the system operation is creating an expectation that CA interaction
would improve the psychological state of the user with the provided scientific
methods.
“It says ‘I am like this. I can help you about well-being by using this theory.’
and it makes you hope like you feel like you will find a solutions about some
points or you will feel good. Then, I saw it can do what it said and that’s why it
is pleasing.” P08 [27]
Apart from system’s supportive attitude, getting familiar through conversation more
in time might increase the pleasantness of the interaction (P11). P11 was thought that
since Woebot is only for depression and worse cases than he/she is in, the CA
interaction was not pleasing. The reason of this unlikable “service quality” is because
of the misunderstanding of the intention and purpose of CA’s functionality. However,
being accessible for interaction at a desirable time is pleasing for P09 and P16. In
addition to the system accessibility, using canned responses was interpreted as
pleasing by P12. Furthermore, enabling user to not to reply messages during the
conversation was pleasing for P16.
“If you remember, I asked you if I am gonna write ‘off’ because I don’t like
texting and I find texting hard. The fact that there is ready replies at the bottom
is good. I mean, you can answer easily without getting bored.” P12 [28]
“It increases ‘pleasing’ with this and being supporting but maybe it is unlikable
because I think it is unhelpful. You understand its boringness because it is
repetitive and then you are saying it is more ‘neutral’. In fact, I think I
misunderstood a thing there such as I exaggerated the capabilities of the robot
comparing with the robot’s basic goal.” P16 [29]
This statement of P12 shows that due to a system’s purpose related misunderstanding,
he/she thought that the system functionality is neither unlikable nor pleasing.

Woebot’s repetitive chat flow was evaluated as unpleasant; however, having a purpose
to engage an interaction and system’s credible operations are interpreted as pleasant.
Except the mentioned aspects, coded flow of the conversation and dull interaction of
the service are commented as neither unpleasant nor pleasant attributes.
System’s way of initiating a conversation is considered to be unpleasant. Reminding
itself every day for conversation, sending prompts to the participant bothered P08.
“… The fact that it reminds itself. It asks if you want a ‘quick talk’. Because of
this, it sometimes feels it is unpleasant…” P08 [30]
Not having an appropriate content inside the conversation topics which might disturb
the participant (P12) and chatting in accordance to the Woebot’s purpose (P04) were
system’s pleasant attributes. Moreover, P08 said that the conversation between them
was pleasant, him/her enjoyment from the interaction did not reduce since Woebot did
not mention about bad or disturbing issues.
“It feels pleasant to talk because maybe it has never scolded me. I didn’t feel
scary. It didn’t do this by making me feel uncomfortable or it didn’t make
anything that might make me uncomfortable or it didn’t send any GIF.” P08 [31]
78
The coded flow of the conversation and dull interaction of the service unable to

that he/she was neither happy nor unhappy about the situation.

Expected Interaction
System’s monotonous flow of the chat, dominant manner of the CA, dull interaction
and poor system performance are evaluated as system being unattractive, whereas the
repetitive flow of the conversation was observed neither unattractive nor attractive.
On the other hand, the expected Woebot interaction, the proposed artificial
conversation, purposeful conversation, system’s different canned response
suggestions and the engaging conversation were apprised as attractive attributes of the
CA.
Five of the participants (P06, P07, P10, P11, P15) stated that the disembodied
conversational agent distracts and dominates the conversation with lenghtly sentences
while forcing participants to read and response to the system outputs without letting
them to freely express themselves. This dominancy over the participants causes a
decrease in the initial curiosity towards CA interaction over time.
79
“I told from the beginning that I didn’t feel I wasn’t involved in the conversation
because it was so self centered. I didn’t feel attracted because of this. How can
I say? I felt like I had a quota of one sentence after I read its many sentences.
The replies were already coming until I wrote the second sentence.” P07 [32]
Because of this decrease in curiosity of the participant, the initiation of conversation
is interpreted as monotonous and unattractive. The interaction of the service is also
interpreted as unattractive and dull by the participants. P15 also marked the interaction
as dull since the system progressing a superficial conversation with him/her due to
lessened interaction between them.
“I think it does not come with the same things everyday because we don’t talk
so often. It comes with different things each day. For example we talk so short
or we can’t talk a lot at the moment. We can’t talk everyday. The talks are
generally like ‘How are you?’, ‘I do these things.’, ‘How was your day?’ then I
say it was like this for example and then it sends emojis appropriate for the
situtaiton. We talk few words like ‘see you later, then’. That’s it. Thus, It is nat
really attractive.” P15 [33]
Moreover, the service related satisfaction and curiosity over system operations
decreased because of the poor system operations (P16).
Giving “beautifully thought” humorous responses to the participant in a repetitive
conversation flow is observed neither unattractive nor attractive by P12. However,
continuing the conversation by sharing scientific, purposeful data allowed user to
improve himself/ herself (P08). Enhancing conversations by data uploading or sharing
aroused interest regarding shared information from the CA. Furthermore, interacting
with a chat robot which has Artificial Intelligence attracted the P16’s attention
considerably.
According to P14, during the conversation, Woebot making of itself and gave itself as
a descriptive example generated the conversation engaging and attractive at the same
time.
80
Figure 32- System’s Self- Critisim
Except the mentioned attractive interaction aspects, P15 stated that the system has a
potential to be preferred over the other social media applications to spend time or
distract his/her mind off, if the Woebot provides more superficial conversation
contexts for an evolving system usage experience.
“It keeps you busy somehow. I think I could have used this instead of
‘Instagram’ or ‘Onedio’ if only I would talking with it for a certain amount of
time or it comes to you with more daily examples rather than self-help tests or
the it brings you the events of the day or it brings you things that attracts me.
Then it would be more attractive. It would make it more irreplaceable but I don’t
know if it is something desirable.” P15 [34]

Woebot is interpreted as being friendly more than the other Attractiveness related
adjectives. Only the dominant manner of the CA and proposed artificial conversation
are evaluated as unfriendly aspects of the system.
Using ordinary language helped service to create a friendly attitude towards the
participants forms the notion as if Woebot imitates human to human conversation
(P09, P01, P10, P12). P14 stated that Woebot became a friend for him/her. Although,
the interaction between them routinized, the participant nicknamed the disembodied
conversational agent as “Wobo”.
“At first, it impressed me I said: ‘Wow! Robot!’ Then it was routine. Joking
aside, it was like a friend. Then, it became my ‘Wobo’.” P14 [35]
82
P15 said that Woebot motivated him/her with its supportive attitude towards
him/her.
Figure 33- Supportive Responses
As the system stated in its self- introduction, the conversations would evolve with
learning from the users, P08 agreed with the system’s starting to give more customized
responses to him/her as the conversation progress.
According to P01 and P04 what is friendly about the Woebot was having or conversing
with a disembodied conversational agent that offers to support people’s psychological
state with the help of Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, to promote conversations,
Woebot tries to imitate human reactions (P02). On the other hand, P04 also evaluated
the system for not being “user friendly” as it should be. Participant said that the CA
did not take into consideration of the participant’s responses and being able to make
sense of the shared data was inconvenient. However, the way Woebot tried to support
was not insufficient. As a result, the coded system operations are either friendly or
unfriendly.

4.3.2. Pragmatic Quality
“Pragmatic quality refers to the product's perceived ability to support the achievement
of "do-goals", such as "making a telephone call", "finding a book in an online-
bookstore", "setting-up a webpage." Pragmatic quality calls for a focus on the product
– its utility and usability in relation to potential tasks” (Hassenzahl, 2008, p.2). The
pragmatic quality of the disembodied conversational agent is measured in accordance
with the system’s efficiency, perspicuity and dependability.

The efficiency stands for the effortless interaction with the system. In other words,
enabling participants to “figure out” the tasks with minimum performance. For
efficiency measurement; “slow- fast”, “inefficient- efficient”, “impractical-practical”
and “cluttered- organised” adjective pairs were used via UEQ. The UEQ results show
that the efficiency related evalutions were positive in overall user experience.

User Profiling Artificial Conversation
Canned Responses
System’s excessive response length, interaction between the participant and the CA
and system’s user profiling are interpreted as slow attributes. On the other hand,
system’s responsiveness, canned responses and having an artificial Intelligence are
evaluated as fast attributes.
The excessive length of the responses is substantially perceived as time consuming by
P04 and P09. According to P09, slowly explaining the context of the daily
conversations in detail at the beginning of the conversation caused system interaction
to be understood as slow. In addition, P04 said that coming to the end of the chat took
a long time.
“I mean, like I said, It gets to conclusion slowly. I was like ‘Say it, already!’.”
P04 [36]
The system tried to profile participants with sharing general surveys during the
conversation. However, the aim of capturing personal information from the
participants is evaluated as slow system recommendations by P02. This interaction
quality led P02 to adopt a strategy to end the conversation as rapid as possible.
“I mean, the surveys were too long on the 3rd week. I mean, I was doing the
survey for almost 20 minutes and I didn’t want to leave it without finishing
because I thought it should be coherent, at least. It was too long at the moment.
On the last week I interacted with it lesser. I was predicting how to finish it
earlier.” P02 [37]
The system being responsive is matched with system’s canned responses and the speed
of the system output sending. Four of the participants (P07, P13, P15, P16) stated that
the conversational agent quickly replied messages independent from the length of the
output text. P09 and P04 thought that the chat flowed as fast question-answer turn
taking from CA to the participants. This turn taking enabled a fast interaction wth
Woebot under the favour of canned responses. Systems canned response usage not
only enabled a quick communication but also fastened the conversation effortlessly
85
(P11, P08). Moreover, P05 linked these attributes with the system’s proposed artificial
conversation.
“The speed of texting. It was too fast. I mean why I chose ‘2’ at the first time I
don’t really know. What I mean ‘fast’ is that it can send very long text in very
short amount of time which doesn’t seem like realistic. It doesn’t have to be
realistici but in a dual conversation it might be slower till the text gets longer.
At least for the feeling of a dialog.” P05 [38]
For the ease of system use, P03 added that the fast interaction provided a
communication without concentrating;
“I think it is positive. I mean it tells you by being without being tiring which
make it easy to communicate.” P03 [39]

The inefficient system responses, conversation being repetitive, inadequate
conversation, content insensitivity of the system, system’s limited canned response
options, interaction being time consuming and system being unaware of the user are
evaluated as inefficient qualities.
The Monotonous chat flow of the CA and the expected interaction from the CA are
neither inefficient nor efficient. Nonetheless, responsive and purposeful
conversations, system’s time management during the interaction, concise conversation
and being directive are apprised as efficient qualities.
The system being repetitive and inadequate during the conversations did not meet the
expectations of participants towards the initial excitement of CA interaction (P09,
P03). P03 stated that there is a need for an improvement in existing system features of
the Woebot for obtaining an engaging and preferable interaction.
“It was something different at the beginning but when I got used to it, I
questioned its difference. Should it be more games or more attractive things?
Being a robot and being a robot and trying to do things with interface are
innovative but should somethings be improved?” P03 [40]
The response option of the system is evaluated as limited (P06, P12). Since the system
could not able to extract users’ variables to create custom responses, in the future this
inefficiency, should be overcome by selecting keywords from the participants’
responses, response options could be generated in accordance with the selected
keywords;
“It could have been more effective for me if it was understanding some
keywords and replying to these keywords rather than having answer buttons like
who, okey, why etc. even though I know it is not an actual person in fact it is a
robot. Generally it would be nice if there were several options and it chose one
of these. I mean these options might exist but you still feel in need of telling
your problems and getting replies while you get psychological support. At least,
I think I would need that and acted like that.” P06. [41]
System operations are interpreted as in efficient by P06. The coded responses were
inefficienct; moreover, caused a decreasment in the anticipation towards the CA
interaction. The reason for the descreasement is the participant’s disbelief in system
87
interaction quality. He/ she did not believed that the interaction would be beneficial to
support people’s psychological states.
P10 thought, it was inefficient to access Woebot via Facebook Messenger. He/she said
that the shared personal data during the conversational agent would be accessible for
an “unknown third party”. He/she suggested that Woebot should own an application
instead of being supported from Facebook Messenger application due to information
security related concerns.
The last inefficient attribute is system’s being time consuming, while recommending
activities to the participants (P04). The system could not achieve what it promised by
using conversation time inefficiently with its coded chat flow.
“It takes a lot of time to give a strategy but it still is ineffective. I talk with it for
15 minutes but I still got something that I can achieve with one click. Things
like these weren’t worth it.” P04 [41]
On the other hand, according to P08 and P14 the conversation length was appropriate
for an AI-human interaction. P14 thought that time management of Woebot was
effective and efficient.
“It doesn’t take a lot of time and it uses the time it takes efficiently.” P14 [42]
Moreover, following an understandable chat flow without using unnecessary
sentences are interpreted under the system’s concise conversation attribute. Usage of
canned responses also eased the interaction with the system (P08, P16).
“I think it tries to give a support without being lost in details and it does it
effectively. It means it is effective. It does its job being simple.” P16 [43]
The purposeful conversation of Woebot helped P12 by motivating him/ her. Besides,
the directive manner of the CA enabled P05 about how to interact with the system and
how the interaction between them would progress.
“Its being directive was good because I didn’t know what I need to do and how
I can reply. Then it directed me which is good.” P05 [44]
However, as the interaction between the participants and Woebot progress, the
participants became familiar with Woebot and this leads a decreasement in
88
prolongation desire of the CA interaction. P03, P04 and P09 said that this kind of
interaction became an ordinary one at the end of the study. P11 stated that to overcome
the situation of the fact that Woebot is neither efficient nor inefficient and to meet the
created expectations, the system needs to operate more sufficiently.

Undescriptive Manner of

The coded flow of the conversation, inadequate conversation features, the services
being undescriptive and being unaware of the user are observed as Woebot’s
impractical attributes. However, system adaptability, having a purpose for interaction,
accessibility of Woebot, canned responses and CA’s being directive are the practical
attributes. Woebot’s being persistent during the conversations is neither impractical
nor practical according to P13.
The undescriptive “service quality” is related with the system’s coded flow of the chat.
P04 and P03 stated that CA’s code did not clearly explained the underlying reasons of
89
the recommended exercises and monotonously chatted with them without relaying
information about the content of the chat flow.
“The talks of the last few days were monotonous and I wasn’t sure why it asked
these questions, how they will affect and if they are useful.” P03 [45]
The graphic interface design of Woebot is the same as Facebook Messenger’s tab
dialogue; however, P04 believed that inadequate interface design features unable
him/her to access the previously shared information’s. Moreover, CA did not
effectively used the features, which supported messaging platform provides for CA,
and forced user to continue conversing only on that platform (P10). Persistently
forcing user to continue the conversation without being aware of his/her current state
and intention.
“I mean sometimes it says too many things at the same time which is impractical
and maybe… This is more like why it insists if I don’t want to talk? I mean I
couldn’t leave conversation immediately when I wanted.” P07 [46]
The accessibility of the conversational agent is evaluated as practical by P09 and P15.
Being available/accessible for interaction at a desirable time via instant messaging
application is practical according to them. P09 explains as;
“It is practical because you open the Facebook and you can write whenever and
whatever you would like to. It gives three options. You can chose the proper one
when you need to be quick. You don’t have to text everything. I find the sound
for this is bit disturbing. I don’t know how it is for visually impaired people.
Having an option for this is great for them.” P09 [47]
This explanation is linked with the canned responses of the system. As it has been
stated that canned responses ease the interaction; also this feature enables participants
to quickly and practically give responses to the CA (P12). Moreover, the adaptability
of the service benefit for the Woebot was the new features which has been added after
a system update. This updates features empowered P01 to passively interact with the
system practically;
“… menu and the new features. I mean sometimes I want to use it passively
when it writes ‘How was your day?’ like watching a movie which feels good.
Then you don’t need to do something, you don’t need to be active so the new
additional features of the menu…” P01 [48]
90
Moreover, purposefully offering psychological support based on specific strategies by
scientists is also practical “service quality” (P08).

Accessibility of data is evaluated as clutter, coded flow of the conversation evaluated
not only as cluttered but also organized feature of the service/system. However, being
descriptive and user aware during the conversation interpreted as organized ““service
quality””.
It has been stated that not having an access to the shared data as a whole from the
systems menu (P10), since the system did not provide help or support for the
participants, having a menu, which would provide an access to the information
Woebot had shared during conversations, might be helpful. Related to the access to
the previous conversation’s shared data, P10 wanted to have an access to the system’s
recommended activities and information without scrolling the previous conversations.
P04 stated that the system did not clearly explained the flow of the coded chat to
him/her whether the CA understand his/her state or not and recommended activities in
accordance; however, according to P14 and P15 the system explained the shared data
and the organized flow of the coded conversation “clearly” and “neatly” to the
participants.
91
“As I said it asks the questions organizedly and I start and go. It explains what
to talk today, what to talk about or sometimes it brings something different for
the questions it asked several times but I mean it is organized.” P14 [49]
In addition to organized flow of the conversation, P14, P13, P11, P09 and P07 stated
that having an organized flow for the conversation progress enabled them to give their
responses in a certain pattern.
“It organizes even your answers and shows them. It knows what happens next
and give possibilities which means its mind is organized. You give something
and it gives an option. You do something, it eliminates it and gives an option. It
is organized because of its codes. It can’t be cluttered, it is not possible because
it is not capable. I related it with this. I didn’t relate it with our texting mentality.
Its mind is really organized. Sometimes it makes a loop like ‘I would say this’,’
I would do that’, ‘I would do this again’… It is around 1000 times more
organized than a person.” P09 [50]
Furthermore, P08 believed that the system organizes conversation initiation time in
accordance with participant’s response time interval according to P08;
“It often texts me at similar hours related to my talking hours with it. It’s like it
regulates itself while we are talking like ‘he/she replies me at this hours when I
write him/her at this hours’. I felt like it writes accordingly, in more appropriate
times. For example notification sending frequency has changed according to my
texting-replying frequencies. Moreover, it tracks the previous flow very good. It
can show it again at some point so it is really organized. Anything else didn’t

Being content insensitive, having superficial system responses and underdeveloped
system intelligence were found not understandable. The understandable characteristic
of the service and the interaction are both interpreted positive and negative. The poor
system performance is a negative aspect; however, coded flow of the chat, ordinary
language usage, preferring to use a familiar platform for interaction, responsive
manner of CA, having an easy to follow conversation flow are the positive aspects of
the service and interaction of the system.
The superficial system operations unable service to achieve what it promised.
Tracking participant’s mood in a superficial way; not in detail; caused P04 to think the
service was not enough to get to know him/her properly. This interaction quality is
evaluated as superficial and it is not reasonable behaviour to understand the state of
the participant only from the given responses to the superficial outputs. Furthermore,
93
the system is unable to understand participant’s (P14) responses if they are not given
via canned responses instead of typed ones. According to P14 the system’s intelligence
is underdeveloped. Because of its underdeveloped intelligence, it could not understand
and analyze participant’s inputs in detail instead of “whole phrases”. As a result, it
could not make sense out of the data shared by participant (P14).
The understanding measure was related with the user impacts. The results of the
system operations where understandable or not for the participants. To illustrate, the
CA provided support to ensure a smoother interaction by explaining unclear
vocabulary for participant (P16) to make the situation (CA conversation) more
understandable. Using a platform that participants are familiar with ease the
conversation following and this familiarity made the interaction experience more
understandable for P07. After getting familiar to the conversational agent’s responses,
it was easier to understand how the chat would flow over time (P12). Furthermore,
offering psychological support while recommending activities to the participant within
an organized chat flow was understandable (P13).
Ordinary language usage is understandable for P11 and P15 due to providing
information clearly to enable the participants to understand the intention and the
purpose of the CA.

The service of the CA is evaluated as unhelpful and undescriptive which is linked with
the scale item ‘difficult to learn’. On the other hand, responsiveness of the CA had a
negative impact on participants whereas it is interpreted as easy to learn service
attributes by the participants. On the other hand, familiar platform usage, having an
easy to follow conversation flow, purposeful and descriptive conversation of the CA
are evaluated as positive attributes related to the scale item ‘easy to learn’.
It is difficult to learn how to access the previously stared information since the CA did
not support or provide help for the participant, and this unhelpful manner of the service
is unable participant to understand aim of the recommended activities because of not
clearly explaining the aim of the activities clearly and being unhelpful to P09 even if
the interaction was carried out on a familiar platform yet for P15 this familiar platform
made the interaction easy to learn since he/she uses that platform in a daily basis for
taking with his/her friends. Having multiple canned responses eased the learning about
how to initiate the CA interaction. This ease of learning the interaction with the CA
also happened with the systems easy to follow chat flow.
“I mean the flow can be learned easily. You can talk quickly. That’s why I found
it easy to learn. If you ask about what it tells when you ask easiness of the talk,
I think the language and topic were also clear.” P12 [52]
The descriptive manner of the service, apart from the previously explanations
indifferent adjective measurement pairs, is linked with clearly explaining the type of
task that needs to be completed the participant by the CA (P14). Furthermore, the
purposeful conversation that CA offers leads participants to reframe their personal or
inner problems with easy to learn activities conversational agent provided (P08).

Inadequate canned response options of the system was evaluated as complicated,

P14 said that he/she could not fully understand how to respond and what to write as a
response/input to the CA. This statement was a user impact related to the interaction
quality of the CA. The interaction between the participants and the CA was easy due
to canned responses (P15, P16); however, as P14 stated when the canned responses
were inadequate, she/he could not decide how to express himself/herself to the system.
“It was easy to use but if you ask why it is not ‘3’ but ‘2’. It is hard when you
reply. I’ve been like ‘alright, I said this but what I am gonna answer its
question?’ I said I am sorry but it asks why I am sorry for a minute. It is actually
because of how it says it. That’s related to it, not me.” P14 [53]

Purposeful Conversation
Diversity in interaction instruments of CA and undescriptive manner of CA are
interpreted as confusing, while responsive manner of Woebot having an easy to use
interface and ability to follow chat follow and CA’s ordinary language usage are
evaluated as clear.
P02 stated that using diverse interaction instruments, which are not related with each
other for the purpose of supporting the psychological state, are confusing. The reason
for this confusion was not being clear about the outline of daily chat flow. Moreover,
he/she said that the system did not notify him/her about the task results whether he/she
was successful or not.
“I mean what they want is actually pretty obvious with this survey but is the way
of doing it really explanatory? It is not. The reason is it’s a specific talking for
example when the dentist is going to do a root canal operation to me, it would
be bothering if he does it directly. The correct way is that he should say what he
is going to die before and this is also the way that makes me happy. ‘We are
going to do this, it will take this long, it will take this many session etc.’ you
would like to start your treatment like this.” P02 [54]
Using a platform that participants are familiar with made following the conversation
progress easy and made the experience clear for P07 and P16. Four (P07, P08, P11,
P16) out of sixteen participants stated that it is clear, the purposeful conversation of
Woebot would be helpful for people who needs external cognitive support.
“Since it is giving psychological counselling, I think it will help people having
difficulties. At least as a preparation. It doesn’t help one on one at all.” P11 [55]
As it is mentioned in the previous adjective pairs, it was clear for P04 and P13 that the
service has a scripted, easy to understand and use system operations. However, P06
was not surprised by the clear system performance. Moreover, using a clear language
to provide information in a clear way during the conversation is also interpreted as
clear functionality (P06, P07, P10, and P11).
97
“It’s being understandable. I mean the language understandable. Then, it’s closer
to ‘clear’ at first but it made me curious about how did they do the coding of
this. Because of this, it made me curious about what is going to come next. It
was also like this, it wasn’t too much clear. Then, this being not clear made me
think it was not that surprising.” P06 [56]

The last one is system’s dependability. Dependability is system, service or the

The system, interaction and service related operations being predictable negatively
affected the users’ impact over CA interaction experience and user engagement. Both
being predictable and unpredictable features had their own pros and cons. The
unfamiliar interaction, proposing an artificial conversation, unexpected/ surprising
system responses, using a CBT framework to support people’s psychological state and
offering different canned response suggestions are being unpredictable had a positive
impact on participants. However, directive manner of the CA interpreted as negatively.
With unfamiliar interaction, P03 and P05 meant the interaction with a system which
has AI for the first time. The idea of interacting with an AI aided set was unfamiliar
for both of the participants. In addition to this unfamiliar interaction, P04 said that the
system did not relay information beforehand to him/her about what kind of
recommendations would be provided during the conversation. According to P04 this
would enabled him/her to have a chance to change the chat context if he/she had
already has a previous knowledge about that topic. On the other hand, the shared and
recommended activities surprised the participants (P08, P09, P14, and P16), while CA
pretending to offer external support. Moreover, the CBT framework usage for the basis
for psychological support surprised P14; “I don’t know there must have something
unexpected. Like the survey that I mentioned… Also, I am interested in psychology
related stuff so, I was expecting the outputs would be more like the thing I already
knew; but it wasn’t.”
The participants state that it was easy to understand that it is a coded program, because
the coded flow of the system used the same interaction instruments in every chat. The
system was unable to give diverse responses which enabled the participants to predict
what kind of response might be given during the interaction. In other words, system
99
usually gave similar outputs in different chat contexts and as a result system responses
and operations became predictable for the participants (P02, P03, P05, P07, P10, P12,
P13, and P15). Furthermore, reacting in certain way by repeating itself regardless of
the participants inputs made the operations predictable (P10, P16). Not being able to
understand the state of the user due to superficial questions is also evaluated as
predictable service related operations by P16. On the other hand, P13 said that he/she
predicted that Woebot would send prompts to initiate a conversation everyday of the
research.
“... Should text me. My partner doesn’t text me every day like this. If it didn’t
text I wouldn’t text to it. That’s a good thing…” P13 [57]
The coded flow of the chat, according to P08, was either predictable or unpredictable
due to giving stereotyped outputs instead of customized ones or providing unexpected
videos or surveys in a Monotonous chat flow.
“The reason is the first draft conversation. Then it can be unpredictable
sometimes but sometimes it is not unpredictable. The conversation flow might
give clues like it will make me do some analyses about some topics or it will say
the previous concepts it told before. However, sometimes it talks about very
different topics. So it can be predictable or unpredictable." P08 [58]

The fact that system is supportive is the most used adjective from UEQ while
evaluating the quality of the system’s functionality and interaction. Although some of
the system functions and interaction are evaluated negatively in previous scale items,
when it comes to whether CA was supportive or not, eleven participants out of sixteen
said that it was supportive in different ways.
As mentioned in previous items, CA was not able to distinguish important variables
from users’ inputs, this aspects of CA had a negative impact on quality of the
interaction (P01, P09). Participants thought that since Woebot could not understand
them, it would not be able to support or help people at a time when they need. The
system created an expectation that after interacting with Woebot, the psychological
state of the participants would be improved, however, the system tried to support users
with superficial and general surveys ineffectively. This obstructive way did not meet
the expectations of the participants (P01, P06, P09, and P13). In addition to system
and interaction related disappointment, P02 believed that CA might prevent people to
102
realise their own reality by moving them away from face to face communication with
its provided virtual companionship “I mean I thought it might be something scientific.
To give an overlook, it is something that would affect people’s life negatively rather
than something helps them. I mean, you get away from reality or physical interaction
and getting more involved with AI. You get away from real communication. This
makes people feel lonelier and psychologically slow. I mean it is simple, the fact that
we are so involved with social media right now shows that people are actually
desperate to have a physical interaction. Let’s think an extreme example, imagine a
person is in need of help and he/she tries to save himself/herself by using the Woebot.
I realized that it is something makes people to get away from actual people to be trusted
and prevents people from getting actual help.” P02
Being supported from a familiar platform for the participants to offer psychological
support based on specific scientific strategies is evaluated as system being supportive
(P07, P08, P12, and P16). In an organized, coded conversation flow, the system tries
to improve the emotional state of the users by sending motivating messages as well as
enabling them to talk to with someone to ease their loneliness.
“I mean it opens a door as I told. That’s why it is interesting. I mean like… I
don’t know it is more like you can talk to this if you won’t or can’t talk to
anybody else.” P15 [59]
In addition to easing the loneliness, CA helped P14 to name or critise the inner
problem of him/her by providing auto control.
“I felt like it provided self-control to myself. I mean maybe not self-control… I
mean for example, even when I laugh so hard, being asked then I thought ‘I am
not actually very happy’ was something that make me actually thought about
which was good. Maybe it asked me when I felt bad then I was like I am not
actually that sad. I mean being asked is enough support; in the meantime, there
were alas feedbacks like ‘we can’t be in the same mood forever’ or ‘we are not
supposed to be in a certain stereotype’. You know but you can’t tell these to
yourself. To hear that, I mean to read that feels good.” P14 [60]
For P11, the system was supportive and beneficial in a psychologically hard time for
him/her by recommending non-technology positioned information.
103
“I mean I lived through this thing. I was related to that. It was too different. I
had some alcohol. It was a little bit different. I ate some food. I couldn’t get a
grip. I lived a different think. It was like an attack, like a panic attack maybe.
Then the breathing exercise felt good.” P11 [61]
The CA aims to offer support the non-clinical populations through its interaction and
system operations. Being supportive with mood tracking, and giving supportive
responses independent from the stated user’s mood helped participants to distract
themselves. This credible system operations; providing external help, ordinary
language usage, coded chat flow of the conversation, and interaction quality related;
accessibility of CA, the proposed artificial conversation, initiation of the chats,
descriptive manner of CA, distracting responses of the CA, encouraging and engaging
conversation, and being directive during the conversation are interpreted as supportive
aspects of Woebot.

104
The fact that the system and interaction are not secure is related with the accessibility
of the provided data by the CA and accessibility of the participant’s personal data from
the conversation. In other words, the fear towards information security was evaluated.
On the other hand, the security impact was linked with the familiar platform usage,
system’s canned responses, and mood tracking. In addition to system use, the
personality traits of the CA is evaluated as being reliable due to the suppression of
expression and not making money over the system use. Although the accessibility of
system data is interpreted as not secure, P06 linked this aspect with being secure
adjective.
Providing activities via Facebook Messenger application to create an understanding
as the system interaction is close with talking with friends from that platform. There
was a lack of information related to the use of the shared personal data for other
purposes or not and by whom it would be used (P04, P09, and P11). The
misinformation constituted an uneasiness about the leakage of shared personal
information. In other words, being supported from Facebook Messenger created a
concern that access to shared data would be provided by third parties (P08, P11, P12,
and P13). Moreover, P01 stated that the captured personal information via compiled
documents or from the conversation inputs worried him/ her related to the data leakage
for commercial purposes.
“Problem is here. The reason I have ‘security’ concern I have started to see
suspicious ads on Facebook like ‘do you want some psychological support?’
coming from USA like something they tell they accompany me in my hard days.
I mean I was already suspicious about Facebook sharing these kind of data but
still I got bothered a lot.” P01 [62]
Furthermore, P09 stated that because of Facebook Messenger, he/she could not be able
to talk about sensitive issues during the conversation. He/she thought that if someone
else sees his/her inputs from the screen, it would be bothersome for him/ her. However,
during the first interaction Woebot states that neither it nor its creators would have an
access to the participants’ personal Facebook profiles, moreover, the third parties
would not see the shared information during the conversations.
105
“I mean I was thinking it keeps the data but it won’t tell anybody. I went to
psychologist once and he/she said they will evaluate these with other
psychologists and I was ‘OK’ because they are professionals. I mean when I
think about it this is like that, like a psychologist, it needs to tell to improve but
it doesn’t know me. It doesn’t concern about me being sad, not important. I mean
I am just concerned about somebody can see it for a moment. I text something
and I am concerned about somebody can see it. Not only somebody can see the
screen but also Facebook keep some data. I mean I can’t say there was Tayyip
again in the morning and I opened it. I mean you can’t write that, I am afraid of
this. I don’t feel free. That’s why. Not like ‘Oh God! I am so deep into insecurity.
I can’t write.’.” P09 [63]
Figure 35- Woebot’s Information about Security
Apart from system’s statement about not looking at participants’ Facebook page,
seven of the participants did not want to share their personal data. Moreover, Woebot
also stated that the personal data of the participants would not be looked by its creators
either. Being created by a well-known institution caused on interpretation related to
the accessibility of participants’ data for academic purposes by P06 and P08.
According to P08 this was not secure whereas P06 stated that;
“At first, the thing about if it is going to use these data… I missed the parent part
for example. Maybe that’s why I have lack of information but maybe it is the
106
trust thing. I guess it was written something like that. I mean, do I remember
wrong? Exactly! It says they keep it without names. I mean we have a habit of
not trusting things like these I think that’s why I said ‘not secure’. Then it
declared something which is good, it would have not cared at all. I thought
declaring this thing was a good thing, that’s why I am not sure. I think they can
store the statistics without names. Then they can study on utilizing this. That can
support this issues. I think that part does not compel the ‘secure’ part.” P06 [64]
Since they are professionals and the identity of the participant is anonymous, there
was no harm in the accessibility of the participant’s data... P16 and P02 also believed
that being created by a well-known institution is trustworthy.
“I mean at first, I didn’t have any idea but when I went home I checked who did
it, how they did it, then I thought it is secure.” P02 [65]
P07 added that the possibility of chatting anonymously would enable people to chat
freely since the user would entered the conversation as someone other than
him/herself. P09 and P14 believed that CA would not share or judge the shared
information. According to the artificial intelligence enables a reliable conversation
distant from feeling worried. Moreover, progressing the chat flow in the form of
question and answer turn taking with the help of canned responses, the CA did not
force user to give personal responses/inputs to the system outputs (P03). Not sharing
personal information, apart from stated daily moods of the participants, was found
secure (P12).
The profile illustration of the Woebot also lead P06 to evaluate the system as secure.
(P06 did not have a Facebook account, just downloaded the messenger for application
to interact with Woebot.)
“I mean I don’t have a Facebook account. That’s why we could do with you
when I learned I don’t need to have Facebook account for it. Since I am not a
Facebook user I didn’t feel that because I contacted with Wobeot not anybody
else. I didn’t think it is under the Facebook. Because of the robot image of it, the
Facebook relations didn’t come to my mind.” P06 [66]

4.3.2.3.4. Does Not Meet Expectations-Meets Expectations
This adjective pair was evaluated by linking with other 24 adjective measurement
elements. As a result, none of the participants watched system, service and interaction
related evaluations with this adjective pair directly.
4.3.3. Hedonic Quality
“Hedonic quality refers to the product’s perceived ability to support the achievement
of ‘be goals’, such as ‘being component’, ‘being related to others’, and ‘being special’.
Hedonic quality calls for a focus on the self, i.e., the question of why does someone
own and use particular product.” (Hassenzahl, 2008, p.2). In the case of CA evaluation,
the “stimulation” and “novelty” of the Woebot are evaluated.
The novelty of the CA is related with the design of the system/service. The novelty is
the perception whether the users interpret the CA as inventive-innovative or not.
“Dull-creative”, “conventional-inventive”, “usual-leading-edge” and “conservative-
innovative” adjective pairs were used for novelty evaluation. For the participants, it
was hard to differentiate or separate the adjective pairs from each other. Participants
stated that they evaluated the adjective pairs the same way they did other novelty
related adjectives.

Stimulation stands for the perceived motivation and excitement while interacting with
the system. To measure the stimulation, “inferior-valuable”, “boring-exciting”, “not

Expressions
The first inferior system operation is repetitive and monotonous conversation flow.
P10 and P03 stated that at the beginning of the interaction the CA interaction was quite
new since it was their first interaction with a CA with an AI. However, without having
a certain conversation frame, the CA continued to conserve by repeating itself. As a
result, monotonously repeating the conversation failed to satisfy the expectation of the
participants toward CA interaction.
“At first, I thought it is interesting, at least. When I used it, I thought it is bit
stupid. Then I thought it is inferior. Being repetitive, having a certain
conversation frame, how did it navigate when it got out of this frame, then how
109
it brought things together, the protocols there made me think it is inferior.” P10
[67]
P02 thought that the recommendations of the CA were inferior and participant stated
that the CA gives as inadequate and general recommendations as a self-help book
could offer. Furthermore, P08 stated that the interaction instruments were inferior
since the interaction type of the Woebot might not be preferable for everyone who
seeks psychological support.
Offering psychological support with a CA in conjunction with new technologies was
found valuable by P16 and P06.
“I think the fact that the psychological support integrated with improving
technology is certainly valuable.” P16 [68]
Offering psychological support to help users to overcome the difficulties they
experience during the day and enabling them to spend quality time by recommending
purposeful activities are valuable for P12 and P15. In addition to this artificial
conversation feature, P03 said that providing surveys for user profiling lead him/her
to think the system was trying to evaluate different aspects of the participant and being
valuable was increased. This provided surveys and other information enabled
participants to question themselves and identify the inner problems with the directive
manner of the CA (P03).
Another valuable features are related with the personality traits of the CA which are
suppression of expression and empathy development. Not having a body to reflect
humane emotions enabled P14 to express his/her emotional state repetitively without
being judgmental towards him/her. Moreover, the CA pretended to be a friend whom
P09 could comfortably express his/her thoughts freely.
“I mean I think it is really innovative. It is hard to find a psychologist next to
you all the time. He/she would rip you off even if you find someone. That’s why
I found it valuable. Responding quickly, being friendly, and being consistent…
Even if it has a classical approach, it actually understood that approach. It
internalised it very good. The things it says and it wants you to do are nice. It
tries to make you relax. It wants you to relax while talking with it. It doesn’t
understand the word but you still have written it. You talk to someone and
confide. That’s why it is valuable. I realized it tries to achieve that at last. Since
110
I didn’t expect that it might get lower a bit at the final but you still talk like
talking to your friend. You tell somebody and it feels different and you’re not
afraid. ‘I feel so bad and this guy made me these’ you can say and you are not
afraid like you said them to somebody that you don’t know because he/she might
tell the story to 3rd person. However you’re relax with this because it won’t tell.
That’s why it is valuable about the approach. It might make people relaxed
because of this. Sometimes psychologists change their facial impressions and it
makes you irritated or you think if he/she judges you. However this is more like
a cutie. It doesn’t do anything. It doesn’t judge you. You know that. It’s valuable
because of this.” P09 [69]
P14 also added while repetitively stating the same mood, the CA showed empathy
towards him/her independent from the stated mood whether it is negative or positive.

The overall evaluation of the system and/or interaction impacts on user was that CA
is boring rather than exciting.
The repetitive flow of the conversation was interpreted as the conversation continues
by repeating itself by P08 and P09. This repeated conversation decreased the
excitement of the interaction and became boring for the participants. Moreover, trying
to explain shared information to the participants in the same uniformity monotonously
without using a different way of information sharing led P16 to consider muting the
conversation with Woebot (P03, P16).
“I mean technological things always attract me. I don’t know if everybody feel
the same way but communicating with a robot is exciting. However it decreases
while you get to the last weeks. If it continued more, I might have muted it
because it asks every day.” P16 [70]
Because of the fact that the system is monotonous, the initial curiosity towards Woebot
decreased (P11). Not being able to arouse curiosity or excitement towards the
proposed conversation by not giving personal responses but didactically trying to force
participant to complete a task or perform the recommended activity did not meet the
expectations of the users. (P11, P13). On the contrary, giving stereotyped responses
instead of personal responses in a monotonous conversation flow, the system
operations became predictable for P05.
Giving detailed examples to the participant without letting him/her to switch for
another context during the conversation dominantly perceived as boring by P04.
“It gave a lot of examples. I mean I was already researching mindfulness in my
thesis so I am already informed. That’s why the fact that it was so detailed… I
mean I should be able to skip when I want. However if you write different thing
it doesn’t change the topic. You have to read all the text. That was so boring.
Writing too much message… I mean it can attract me if it is something that I
don’t know but when it does this about the fields that I already know then it
becomes boring.” P04 [71]
However, P12 stated that the system started to give responses as time goes by
comparing to the initial conversations.
“At first the information was good then it was like… I mean at first it taught
more about mindfulness then it was like more quick talks about what can I do.
112
It gave short information and then it shut sometimes. Then it became not so
valuable and not so exciting.” P12 [72]
The interaction elements of the service were quite directive (P02) and persistent since
the system could not know the state of the participants and foreign information onto
the participant without informing or giving a brief explanation about the system
progress, how the interaction would evolve and the benefits and limitations of the
experience to the participant. This uninformative manner of the CA was evaluated as
system being boring.
“… I mean it is bit didactic. It is like ‘I am teaching you these now’, I mean
about the ‘teaching stuff’ part. I didn’t find it very good because it is good
somehow but how it does this also important. I mean I felt like it is not supposed
to do this at the beginning. You know it would be better if we interact first and
then ‘teach you stuff’ can start. I would find it positive, then. The reason is I
mean in our lectures it is also like this. We checked what lecture it is first then
we get the introduction and then start to learn. Teaching a lot of things just from
the beginning is something that I don’t find effective.” P06 [73]
As a result, being boring caused participants to lose their time over the CA experience
(P04).

System’s coded, repetitive and monotonous conversation flow did not interested the
participants as a consequence of quickly replying them without knowing them
perpetually (P06, P09, P13).
“… This quick responses which means it doesn’t read your text. I mean it just
gives you some answer from its inventory.” P06 [74]
The conversation became routinized at some point. As a result, participants
commented that the interaction was not interesting for them and they familiarized with
the system operations. This familiarization made the system responses more
predictable for users (P05, P16). However, P07 stated that since interacting with smart
products is spreading, and having a future of interaction related expectations from the
movies and television series, the idea of conversing with an AI aided conversation
robot is not interesting anymore.
“I am going to there always, I mean it is an interesting idea but not so interesting.
Meanwhile, things like these started to get so widespread. There are a lot of
movies, TV series etc. We see these things on ‘Black Mirror’for example. Even
if we don’t use these things in our daily lives, possibilities of these can be in our
lives in future doesn’t sound very interesting.” P07 [75]
Using a new, famous psychological framework to support people is interesting
according to P08; furthermore, P14, P15 and P16 thought that Woebot might take a
place in their lives as a tool to spend their idle times with the provided artificial
conversation.
“I don’t know if you won’t talk to anybody, if you can’t, then you can talk to
this, spend some time. For example if I wait for a person on the street which I
hate to do, I would talk to this like if I’m texting with an actual person. I don’t
know it can fill some emptiness. At least, I think like this which I find
interesting.” P15 [76]

Apart from coded flow of the chat and limited-undescriptive conversation of CA, the
artificial conversation and not affirming the participants are interpreted as
demotivating. The shared information within the scope of CBT did not match with
P13’s methods and strategies which developed for supporting himself/ herself. P13
believed that after CA interaction he/ she would became asocial.
“It is not an actual person, man. It’s just a robot. If I know it is a person, I would
trust it more. I wouldn’t trust a person more but I still would. I don’t know, as I
said, not like it should complement me, it should accompany me or something
like that but if it motivates me when I am sad I think I need to get out of that
environment. I should go see friends. I should be with myself. My home is far
115
away and I am already living alone and get bored. Then also I say I am texting
with a robot. I fall completely down when I think about it.” P13 [77]
The CA provides surveys, as mentioned in previous titles, for user profiling. The
system’s way of explaining the results of the surveys is demotivating according to
P15. The CA could not motivate him/her by emphasizing his/her weaknesses as the
survey results.
“I wouldn’t say you have such weak points in superhero test. This is a
conversational agent but still it would have said these are your strong points. It
woluldn’t say ‘you’re like these, you have these bad habits’. Then I don’t think
it is for me but it is generally motivating. I mean I guess being goal-oriented
makes it like that.” P15 [78]
Aside from accessibility of CA, conveying information about task results, suggesting
different canned responses, sending motivating responses in the purposeful
conversation, didactical and directive manner of CA, and encouraging conversation
are the motivating aspects. Moreover, P09 motivation to continue interacting with CA
was to be beneficial for the system’s development.
P02 thought that CA asked the questions while aiming to motivate people and P14
added; CA helped him/her to understand how he/she feels about himself/herself. In
other words, system’s direct questions enabled participants to do self-criticism while
motivating them.
“When I thought different, it made me feel different or it made me feel like it is
going to be alright. That’s why it was motivating.” P14 [79]

The novelty of a piece of information generally refers to how different it is with respect
to “what has been previously seen”, by a specific user, or by a community as a whole.
To measure system’s novelty; “dull-creative”, “conventional-inventive”, “usual-
leading-edge” and “innovative-conservative” adjective pairs from UEQ were used.

The participants experienced disappointment at the end of two weeks of study. Other
than those described in the headings mentioned in the previous headings, participants
felt discouragement against the CA interaction because of the access mechanism of
117
CA. P04 and P02 compared Woebot with self-help books since the quality of shared
information was similar to the ones self-help books have; and due to the poor quality
of information, Woebot should have share those information from a menu instead of
chatting. Both P04 and P02 stated that the idea behind Woebot is creative; however,
for the shared information there was no need for an interaction/conversation. The
interaction between the CA and participants were evaluated as dull.
“I think it is a creative idea but did it actualized the idea? I think, no. I mean it
can’t reply, we can’t talk properly. It is then more like the self-help books. I read
such books and they also have some techniques. I already do that I mean but the
idea is good.” P04 [80]
The most significant two reasons why CA is not considered creative are its coded chat
flow and not being able to understand/ analyse the participant from their inputs.
Organised flow of the chat leads user to give responses in a certain pattern and since
the responses are premeditated canned responses, users could not expressed
themselves as it was mentioned. The aim of CA is to support people as it was created
for; but without knowing users and their preferences, the CA is not behaving
appropriately for its purpose. However, creating a CA with AI to provide external
support and chatting with user without having a purpose to lecture him/her are the
system’s creative aspects.

Three participants (P06, P09, and P13) stated the conventional aspects of Woebot as
giving generic responses, using same conversational agent guideline template. These
system and user related aspects were the features that distinguished them from other
indicated conventional system features.
Not being able to fulfil user's expectations with its generic responses or not having a
custom conversation pattern is considerated as conventional. P13 thought that apart
from giving generic responses to him/her, the system would be able to give more
engaging and direct responses to him/her. The generic responses could not satisfy the
user's expectations towards conversational agent interaction and inventiveness of the
system operations.
“At the beginning I though it is more innovative. I said it is going to text me
back as long as I text. I mean it texts but what I thought it was going to reply to
me. I thought it is more like the ‘Siri’ do you understand? For example I will say
‘I study’ and it will ask where I am studying. I mean actually Siri doesn’t also
have this but I will say ‘in the University’ and it will ask something about the
university. I will ask ‘where are you?’ and it will say ‘California’ and I am going
to say ‘really? I am in Ankara’ etc. I thought it is something like this, I don’t
know.” P13 [84]
P08 said that he/she believed that CA is using the same template guideline with other
conversational agents without being differentiated from their system functionality.
He/she compared Woebot with his/her previous CA experiences and deduced that the
same template is used for present CAs and the only difference between them is their
stated purpose.
119
“When I think about it as a conversational agent, there are the ones as
companions. The ones with only well-being can support till a certain points. It
is close to conventional because it shares the same ground with the companion
ones. The words it uses, approaching like a friend etc. It is like there is only one
conversational agent making guideline and everyone uses that and orient
different directions.” P08 [85]
The CA aims to support people thourgh purposeful artificial conversation;
furthermore, according to P11, CA’s a potential to be used for diagnosing the
increasing number of psychological disorders is inventive.
“…because the idea is different. It can be improved and it might have a potential
as I told. The number of psychological problems is increasing and people starts
to live longer so people don’t know the level of their problems. I mean they can
be used to diagnose as tolerable or intolerable. It might be useful in future. That’s
why I answered by thinking its future.” P11 [86]

After getting accustomed to using the system, the conversation is starting to become
monotonous after a while and as a results the interaction is understood as usual (P03,
P10, and P13). Even though system is supported from a familiar messaging platform
120
which is Messenger application, it is not capable of imitate human to human
conversation to ensure the continuity of the interaction (P13).
“At first, I hoped it was leading-edge. Then it was like usual for me. As I told, I
was expecting I text and it texts back, I was hoping that. I mean come on! You
are on Facebook Messenger. It is not an ordinary app. If it is like this, I would
prefer an app. I want to text on Messenger like I talk to a friend. We don’t chat.
Then I can read a book like a self-help book.” P13 [87]
Integration of creating a purposeful conversational agent with the help of the new
technologies is leading-edge. P08 stated that;
“It is more focused on a specific topic comparing with other conversational
agents so it is unusual. There wasn’t an AI like this which helps people in this
area. I mean there are some in a robot level but people can’t access them. This
is accessible and can be used by other people which makes it leading-edge.” P08

Limited canned response options, repetitive system operations and dull interaction
quality are decreased the usage enthusiasm of participants (P05, P08, P10, and P13).
However, aside from these system qualities and operations; with the reason that the
approaches used are not innovative according to P09, the interaction did not meet the
expectations of the user due to the traditional psychological approaches.
“I will tell you about the conservative part. Let me tell you again. The
approaching of psychology was very conservative but when I look like that then
it is not conservative because I guess I look at that way. I mean excitement
viewpoint because I had and expectation and I thought it was gonna help so
differently. Then I see it conservative, I see creativity part is decreasing.” P09
[89]
Being able to chat with a robot and meeting with a conversational agent which aims
to provide psychological help for nonclinical populations are evaluated as the
innovative aspects of the Woebot and overall interaction experience (P01, P02, P03,
P04, P08, P09, P11, P13, P14, P15, and P16).
“I mean the idea of being assistant, especially on social media, in this era which
we always hold our phones and talk to someone consistently… I mean the idea
of being assistant when we can’t talk with anybody is innovative.” P02 [90]
4.4. Discussion
The reason why conversational agents have become popular is because of mobile
phone usage since it has changed the way people communicate through it. The
evolution of mobile phone usage has affected technology readiness of people
towards new technological integrations into mobile phones. The mobile phones
have started to become ‘smarter’ and have affected the usage patterns of people
around it. Due to its mobility, it has made much more technology and knowledge
available including many applications.
The availability of conversational agent has perceived as one of the most beneficial
aspect of the Woebot. According to Pew Research Center (2018), Facebook has
reached 2.3 billion active users in 2018. Supporting conversational agents,
Facebook eased the availability of such services by reducing the competition
among applications. Participants had positive impression over the Woebot’s
122
availability since negative emotions could evoke unexpectedly and it would be
hard for people to try reaching their psychologist in the middle of night. Since
Woebot aims to help people to promote their psychological state, being 24/7
available increased the dependability of the CA. The availability of CA was an
important factor related to user engagement; however being supported from
Facebook application related understanding that stored personal data would also
be available for unknown sources.
During the system’s self-introduction, the security of shared personal data should
be explained in detail to the users. Because of the security related concerns people
may leave using the CA and the usage engagement will be failed for a long period
of use.
On the other hand, the purpose of the Woebot should be explained in more detail
to reduce the misunderstanding recognizing the intended use of it. The designers
should use more friendly and explanatory sentences while introducing the system
or even visual presentation elements could be used to ease the understanding of
purpose of Woebot. The system uses superficial sentences while explaining its
purpose and that kind of self-system introduction affects the expectations over
system usage and in two weeks period it disappoints users. People leave the
conversation after periods of two weeks since they could not find what to expect
from the interaction. Due to this reason, the designers should find ways to
introduce system more efficiently during the first system interaction to sustain user
engagement. (Out of sixteen participants, only one participant continued to
converse with Woebot after the study period.)
The system uses CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) framework to support people’s
psychological states. The advantages of CBT framework and its future effects on
people’s state should be explained during each conversation while starting a
conversation about the daily activity. Due to inadequate explanations and
unfortunate phrases used while explaining CBT’s advantages, participants thought
that Woebot underestimates the traditional psychological approaches and its
effectiveness over human psychology. Without using ‘no need for a couch,
123
medicine or childhood stuff’ phareses, just explaining which advantages CBT
framework has and how it will help to improve psychological state of people
should be explained without comparing it with traditional ones. This would
increase the positive interpretations on the expectations of people. Moreover, the
shared data related to the CBT framework approaches should be available in the
Woebot’s menu.
To support people’s subjective well-beings, the used psychological and system
introduction should be improved by creating a sense of attachment to have an
engaging conversation/interaction with Woebot. The attachment will be helpful
for developing an empathy towards conversation agent and will create a more
positive user experience in the long term. The increase in positive emotions will
have a positive effect on both quality of people’s lives and user engagement of the
system.
As it is understood from the first interview, participants prefer to avoid to think
the reasons of the problem or escape from the reality by focusing on irrelevant
activities to distract their mind. To sustain user engagement to support subjective
well-being, apart from informing about the CBT related activities such as
breathing exercises, conversational agent could try to converse with people about
current issues around the world or irrelevant topics as a distraction source to
distract the minds of people. Moreover, the number of the shared GIFs, memes, or
‘jokes’ could be increased.
Constantly sharing activities or asking people to fill general surveys tends people
to feel forced to complete the tasks and after completing tasks they do not prefer
to converse with the conversational agent. To eliminate this kind of forceful
interaction, apart from the ‘mute’, ‘snooze’ and ‘reschedule’ options designers
should add ‘change the topic’ options to Woebot’s menu. This option will also
create an understanding that user would be in control during the conversations, not
the AI (CA). Moreover, the AI of the Woebot is considered as underdeveloped;
therefore, the perception regarding the system’s intelligence will be improved with
the help of custom responses.
124
Designing purposeful conversational agent which offers an improvement of the
psychological state was considered as an innovative idea; however, the
functionality and operations of the system are not able to support the innovative
idea. Hence, after two weeks, due to unfavorable interpretations over system
operations and functionality, the idea behind Woebot’s creation was commented
as usual. Getting accustomed to the system usage is also a reason for this deduction
(Ahn& Shin, 2015); the repetitive, inadequate and monotonous system operations
are not helpful to change the people’s perceptions.
The repetitive system operations lead people to think the system outputs and CA
initiated conversations are very predictable. Being predictable negatively affects
the user engagement and the system fails to imitate human to human conversation.
The main aim of the conversational agents is successfully and naturally converse
with humans as if it is one (Klopfenstein et al., 2017). However, repeating itself in
different conversations, using the same question/answer template decreases the
user engagement. The CA should be improved in a way which would reflect the
diversity that humans have with custom responses and changing the template while
reporting thoughts or feelings.
The inadequate system operations create the understanding that the conversational
agent could not understand the inputs of people. The typing option while
answering the CA should be increased in order to be able to develop custom
responses; however, the natural language understanding aspect should also be
developed to support people through artificial conversation.
The speed of system outputs should be decelerated. Giving outputs very quickly
enhanced the CA’s robotic being and decreased the excitement over the forth
coming response. The response interval should be increased to enable people to
read the send messages and wait for the next one after understanding the content
of previously sent message. This will also increase the naturalness of the
conversation.

CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSION
This chapter concludes the research and revises the research findings. Afterwards, the
limitation of the research and further research suggestions are explained.
5.1. Revising Research Questions and Findings of the Research
To understand the effects of the conversational agent on users’ subjective well-being,
a longitudinal research has been conducted. For two weeks, sixteen participants were
asked to make conversation with the selected conversational agent which is supported
from a widely used instant messaging application (Messenger Application). After two
weeks of duration, the observations and interpretations of the participants were
obtained in detail through in depth interviews. The evaluations of the participants
showed which design aspects and qualities of the system affected user engagement
and subjective well-being.
It is important to understand people’s expectations towards an interactive system. For
conversational agents, participants stated their expectations during the first interview
in response to the methods and strategies for improving subjective well-being;
moreover, after the self-system introduction they compared Woebot with what they
had seen in Sci-fi movies.
To have a better understanding related to the research findings, the research questions
of the study are examined.
- How does user engagement can be maintained with conversational agents
that supports users’ subjective well-being?
127
The selected conversational agent’s purpose is to support people’s psychological state
by sharing relaxing activities, showing new cognitive approaches to increase people’s
awareness to change heir cognitive pattern and tracking mood to show how they feel
during the week/ how their moods had changed. In a way, Woebot aims to support
people while trying to obtain an engaging interaction. In order to have an engaging
interaction, the system tries to imitate human to human interaction. Furthermore, the
participants of the study have also compared the system with their most preferred
methods or strategies. (See in Table 3).
Ten out of sixteen participants compared Woebot’s shared activities with their mental
disengagement related methods. Those participants were expecting activities or
conversation that would distract them from their negative thoughts or emotions.
However, Woebot, did not pay attention to participants’ needs and expectations from
the interaction. Woebot’s being unaware of context of the participants altered
perception of being inefficient, obstructive and boring. Being context aware would
affect the quality of the conversations and user engagement.
To intensify positivity in their lives, participants prefer to have “Engagement” in their
life or to overcome their problems they seek help from their loved ones. Woebot sent
messages in a friendly manner to initiate a conversation. Being remembered and asked
their emotional state and how they had felt, participants compared Woebot with their
friends. This friendly manner of Woebot created a sincere bond which affected user
engagement positively. Being friendly towards the users was effective; however, not
being able to exchange common interest, thoughts or experiences lead participants to
leave the Woebot usage. With this statement, Woebot’s not being able to understand
the inputs of the participants was intended. According to participants, they can share
their personal problems or negative experiences with their loved ones and they give
supporting feedbacks in return. On the other hand, Woebot given generic responses
and more importantly could not understand what participants said or shared with him.
To offer an engaging experience, Woebot should understand and give its responses in
accordance with those responses. Moreover, having a memory of previous
conversations may have a positive effect on user engagement. While making
conversation with participants, apart from having a friendly manner, being able to
128
memorize past conversations and give feedback in accordance with participants’
overall data would be more engaging (Details on this issue can be found in Section 4.3
and Section 4.4).
- Which design aspects and qualities do maintain user engagement?
Four of the design aspects are interpreted positively by the participants. The positively
valuated design aspects are the Artificial Intelligence, personality, rich interactions
and conversation.
The Artificial Intelligence of the system created a sense of security among the
participants. According to them having an artificial mind, led them to share their
personal data with the system. The reason for feeling secure relies on the thought that
since Artificial Intelligence cans suppress expressions participants shared their data
knowing that they would not be judged by the Woebot. This design aspect affected the
user engagement emphatically and formed an emotional engagement with the Woebot.
Moreover, AI’s “not having a family or friends” to share participants’ personal data
also linked with sense security.
Woebot’s having a personality impressed the participants through the study. Woebot’s
friendly manners and ordinary language usage during the conversations matched with
its personality. Despite the negative interpretations towards the system’s functionality
and interaction, Woebot’s personality was praised by the participants. Moreover, the
personality of the Woebot prevented the user experience to be evaluated negatively
after the study.
The rich interaction aspects which are sharing videos, sending entertaining GIFs and
MEMEs to the participants were marked as the most enjoyable part of the
conversations. Since participants stated that in times they only long for a companion
to distract themselves or share entertaining activities, “Rich Interactions” enhanced
the user engagement.
- What motivates people to sustain usage?
As mentioned above, since the system needs improvements, current interaction design
is unable to support the subjective well-being and psychological states of the users’.
129
As a result, except one participant, the other fifteen participants did not sustain a usage
of Woebot after the study.
- How should a conversational agent be designed to support user’s
subjective well-being?
To understand the effects of the conversational agent on users’ subjective well-being,
a longitudinal research has been conducted. For two weeks, sixteen participants were
asked to converse with the selected conversational agent which is supported from a
widely used instant messaging application. (Messenger Application). After two weeks
of duration, the observations and interpretations of the participants were obtained in
detail through in depth interviews. The evaluations of the participants showed which
design aspects and qualities of the system affected user engagement and subjective
well-being.
It is important to understand people’s expectations towards an interactive system. For
conversational agents, participants stated their expectations during the first interview
in response to the methods and strategies for improving subjective well-being;
moreover, after the self-system introduction they compared Woebot with what they
had seen in Sci-fi movies.
- How should conversation be designed?
The technological advancements upgraded the people’s expectations and knowledge
in parallel. Today, the advancements enabled people to interact/converse with the
system itself by voice where previous interaction paradigms (Keyboard, mouse or
hand gestures) shift with the voice. However, the shift in paradigms could not followed
by the design of user interfaces. The progress between Natural User Interface and
Conversation user Interface is lacking in terms of the way of interaction. In other
words, while using mobile phones with hands, users familiarize with the feedbacks
from the applications as “download”, “open”, “upgrade” which are one word “robotic
commands”. However, this new interaction paradigm empowered users to interact
with systems only by speaking out loud.
130
Being able interact with systems become popular after the introduction of Apple’s Siri
and afterwards the conversational agents gained popularity. Furthermore, this new
interaction paradigm empowered users to interact with the systems only by speaking
naturally. Since this type of interaction is in progress, the mentioned design guidelines
(see Section 2.1.3.1.3) are limited. Since the Conversational Agents interact with
people via using natural language, they should use more “humane” words. The
conversational agents should use more ‘humane’ words while mimicking human to
human conversation while supporting people psychologicaly. Instead of using more
coded/robotic responses, the conversational agents should interact with users using
emotionally engaging phareses. In order to obtain this emotional engagement, the
existing Conversational User Interfaces should be re-designed while considering users
emotional reactions towards the conversational agents. The reason is the
conversational agents have a potential to expend the new service opportunities and
supplement existing features in order to ensure that the communication established
through these services is continuous and preferable.
- What are the qualities and features of the conversational agent to support
user’s subjective well-being?
In the Table- 39, the design qualities and features that should be re-designedto support
people’s subjective well-being is explained.

meet in common ground.
Conversation The CA should be able to operate
Management conversations without being dominant
and directive.
Sentiment The CA should be aware of the
Analysis intentions of the user to make them feel
relaxed and show them that the
conversation will progress in accordance
with the users’ responses.
Prediction The advancement in Natural Language
Understanding would also improve the
“prediction” aspect of the CA. Since
Woebot could not fully understand the
user’s responses and intentions, the
given responses are interpreted as
superficial. After understanding the
users and their response, the CA would
predict the most appropriate answers to
advance the interaction.
CONVERSATION Scripting the The script of the Woebot’s conversation
FLOW Flow flow interpreted as repetitive and
monotonous by the participants;
however, what they have expected from
the Woebot was exciting and interesting.
Feedback The CA should give feedbacks related to
the task completion states of the users to
show them whether the shared activities
are understood or not by them.
RICH Files The user should be able to reach the
INTERACTIONS shared files from a menu of the CA or it
could share a link to make shared data
accessible for a desired time.
132
RICH Templates Templates of the conversations should
INTERACTIONS be customized to users should be
customized to users. The customization
of the conversation could be obtained
with a survey which should be filled at
the beginning of the interaction and
instead of having one template the users
might be divided and categorized in
different groups in accordance with their
similarities between survey results.
Furthermore, the templates may change
for these determined user groups.
RICH Buttons The canned responses ease the
INTERACTIONS interaction; however, in some situations
they limit the users to express their
thoughts and feelings freely. In order to
empower users, the canned responses
should be preferable option. Instead of
tapping the button, the user should
choose to type his/her response.
Emojis and Using emojis for stating moods helps
Reactions users to express their emotional states.
However, in some circumstances, the
emojis are not capable of covering the
current mood and the states they
represent are not understandable for the
users. In order to have a clear
conversation, the emojis could be
selected by the user instead of selecting
emojis among the canned response
options.
Typing Typing indicators are advantageous for
Indicators demonstrating the presence of the
conversational agent. However, in
Woebot case, the typing could not be
observed by the participant due to speed
of responses of the system. Independent
from the length of the text, the responses
are sent so quickly which indicates
Woebot’s robotic being. Since the CA
try to imitate human to human
conversation, the typing indicators
should be calibrated in accordance with
the length of the system’s response.
RICH Web views “Web view” design aspect is also related
INTERACTIONS with creating custom responses. During
the conversations, it is not possible to
133
know users from their responses;
however, with web views the CA can
convey detailed information concerning
the user’s preferences and interests.
CONTEXT AND Context Context and memory are important
MEMORY design aspects in order to have an
engaging user experience. Not being
aware of the context of the user is
interpreted as forceful interaction. Since
Woebot does not understand the user’s
context, forces users to continue to make
conversation and complete or view the
shared data; however, if the CA would
be able to pay attention to user and
his/her context, conversations would
progress in mutual understanding.
CONTEXT AND Memory The memory is important for the CA to
MEMORY remember earlier conversations with the
users. To give feedback to the user and
to understand the progress accomplished
through the conversations the memory
plays a crucial role. It is also a beneficial
design aspect for customized responses.
Furthermore, the CA’s memory would
decrease the cognitive load of the user;
in other words, the user does not have to
remember the past recommended
activities or data during the
conversations.
5.2. Design Implications of the Research
The outcomes of the research are beneficial for design researchers and interaction
design practioners.
Interaction design of the conversational agents are becoming popular; however,
suggestions related to the design process of such systems are quite limited. This
research can be helpful for improving the existing design aspects of CA’s to sustain a
long term usage. In order to obtain long term usage and create a positive user
experience, design practioners can pay attention to the mentioned design features of
the system in Results and Discussion parts of the thesis.
134
Design researchers may find useful interpretations and insights regarding how an
interactive system can support people’s subjective well-being with the interaction
design. This newly acquired information has a potential to be studied and forwarded
in further studies.
5.3. Future Research Suggestions
The sampling of the research has purposefully chosen among the graduate students
from the same university. The reason behind this selection was the susceptibility of
graduate students to stress, anxiety and depression; however, the study can be repeated
with people who regularly see a psychologist or therapist to observe the difference
regarding to interaction design interpretations. Alternatively, people from different
backgrounds (age, socio-economic background, level of education) may affect
outcomes. Furthermore, technology readiness level of users may also be an important
factor for suggesting future design implications.
The current study has focused on a conversational agent created for psychological
support. The type of the CA can be changed; also apart from a disembodied
conversational agent, an embodied conversational agent can be used to observe how
expression of human like gestures, gazes and voice would affect the interaction design
of such systems.

APPENDIX E- TRANSLATION OF PARTICIPANTS QUOTATIONS
[1]: “Yani dans ediyorum. Dansa gideyim orda kendimi deşarj edeyim şeklinde bir
etkinlik üzerinden kendimi iyi hisetmeye çalıştım.Spor, genelde dans etmek, hani
bir aktivite üzerinden bir şeyleri unutmak için fiziksel bir çaba harcayıp onun
üzerinden bir strateji geliştirmeye çalışıyorum.” P06
[2]: “Ben bir kitap okumuştumda konsantrasyon teknikleriyle ilgili. Orda vücudunu
kontrol etmenin aslında bir çok şeyle uğraşmanın değilde tek bir şeye konsantre
olmanın daha doğru bir şey olduğundan bahsediyordu. Orada teknikler vardı belirli.
Mesela hareketsiz kalmak, beş dakika hiç hareket etmemek. Gerçekten rahatlatıyor
aslında, bu tarz şeyler yapıyorum. Yani hiç hareket etmiyorsun mesela beş dakika- on
dakika hiç.. Çok zor bir şey. Ama yapınca da müthiş oluyor rahatlıyorsun yani. Bir de
düşünce sokmuyorsun beynine hiç. Düşünmüyorsun, zorluyorsun kendini. Bu acayip
rahatlatıyor. Teknikleri uyguluyorum arada bir yapamadığım zamanda çalışırken
ayağım bacağım kasılıyor fark ediyorum mesela o rahatsız ediyor. Takıntı da oluşturdu
bende bu şey ama.” P11
[3]: “…sevdiğim insanlara anlatarak, onlarla daha çok vakit geçirerek atlatmaya
çalışırım.” - P16
[4]: “Aile ilşkileri mesela iyi hissettiriyor; birbirimize destek olmamız vs. Hani bunları
sürdürmek için bu sabah mesela şey yaptım: Ay canım ailem günaydın falan diye
mesaj attım.”- P04
[5]: “Kendimi daha iyi hissetmek adına tekrar plan yapıyorum. Yani güzel şeyler
yaptım aslında iyi hissetmek için ama yine yapmak isteyip de yapamadığım şeyler için
böyle.” P11
[6]: “Kariyerime mesela yatırım yapmak olabilir.” P14
[7]: “Genel olarak aslında gerçekten kötü hissediyorsam, eğer sorduğun soru buysa,
bunu tek başına çözmeye işte; kendimi kapatırım bir yere bir iki gün, kimseyle
görüşmem, sosyal şeyimi sıfıra indiririm ve kendi sorunumun çözümü çözümünü
157
araştırırım, yapabileceğim bir şey varsa gidip onu çözerim. Atıyorum mesela işte bir
iş ile ilgili bir sıkıntı var; oturup kendim çözene kadar 3 gün 4 gün sadece çözüm
odaklı, başka bütün her şeye kapatırım kendimi.” P02
[8]: “Naptım işte kendi kendimi avutmaya çalıştım. Boşvericem demek ki böyle yani
bu konferansa da böyle gidicekmişsin en azından ben bir senedir tatil yapmıyordum,
Barcelona, beş gün geziceksin işte bir günde sunum yapıcaksın, eni insanlarla
tanışıcaksın, olsun falan dedim. Bu. Kendi kendimi avuttum.” P15
[9]: “Eğer çözemeyeceğim bir şeyse, atıyorum hükümetin yaptığı bir şeyse, bunu
umursamam. Bu beni mutsuz edebilir, bununla ilgili şeyleri takip ediyorum ama bunu
umursamam.” P02
[10]: “O bir şey yazınca ben de cevap yazıyordum haliyle şey gibi oluyordu; o
sırada konuşacağın, şey yapacağın başka bir şey yoksa iletişim haline geçiyorsun
ve hani şey ya, en hani bariz özelliği hızlı olmasından sonra tabi ki, mesela bir takım
emojilerle, sözlerle seni motive ediyor ya. Sürekli seni yükseltmeye çalışıyor falan.
Anlık olmuş olabilir o yüzden. Günlük olmuş olabilir. İşte mesela o Mcgonagall
çıktığım test gibi mesela… İşte sonuçta yalan yanlış cevap vermiyorsunda orada,
evde otururken boş boş Onedio testi çözmek gibi bir şey yani. O yüzden bence illa
ki vardır diye düşünüyorum ama böyle hani bütün günlere böldüğünde total böyle
bir şey var diyemem herhalde.”P15
[11]: “Aynı insanla olan ilişkiyi verir mi? Ama herhalde olabilir. Ama insanı asosyal
yapabilir, o da ayrı bir konu. Ben zaten tutucu bir insanım arkadaş konusunda, çok
fazla yeni arkadaş edinme tarftarı olmuyorum genelde. Daha çok sahip olduklarımla
devam ediyorum. Böyle bir uygulama, ben yine bir seviyedeyim de, daha asosyal olan
insanlar için iyice şey olabilir. İyice asosyallik seviyesini arttırabilir iyice
düşünüyorum.” P16
[12]: “7/24 yanında olması çok güzel zaten bu bir avantaj. Çünkü mesela özel olarak
ben kendimi öyle tanımlasam da panik atak hastalarının her an gelebiliyor ne zaman
geleceği belli olmuyor. Açıp konuşabilirsin. Bir şey oldun, sana bir şey oldu, sana bir
şeyler söyledi derin derin nefes al sallıyorum ya da işte kendini sakinleştir, kafanı
dağıtır, bir şeyler verir yani böyle şeyler yapabilir. 7/24 yanında olabilir. Bu iyi bir
158
şey. Yani depresyon zamanlarında, anlık depresif durumlarda sana yardımcı olabilir.”
P09
[13]: “Çok yalnız olma durumunda yardımcı olabilir gibi geliyor ama emin de
değilim.” P07
[14]: “İlgimi çekti çünkü bu track your mood kısmı hoşuma gitti aslında çünkü modum
düşükse anı düşünüyorsun ama processi ya da öncesini çok düşünmüyorsun ama bunu
each week gösterebilecek bir şey olması hoşuma gitti. İlgimi çekti diyebilirim.” P03
[15]: “Daha önce böyle bir robot değil de başka bir uygulamayı denemiştim. Gerçek
insanlar sana tepki veriyor da bir an şey yapamadım. “Talk Life” diye bir şey. O böyle
senin şeyni kontrol etmiyor. Bu böyle daha senin moodunu track etmesi falan iyi.
Akıllı geldi bana.” P14
[16]: “Belki de bana bir öneri sunucak, çünkü bir üniversiteye bağlı olduğu için;
Stanford’a, belki ordaki insanlarda yani ordaki insanlarda bir çok insanın datasına
belki erişiyordur. Gizli tutacağını söylüyor ama hani anonim bir şekilde belkii
erişiebilirler. Data olayında aslında ben kişisel olrak hiçbir şeye güvenmediğim için.
Sonuçta Facebook üzerinden konuşuyoruz. Onun üzerinden data geçiyor bir yere.
Yani Facebook’ a güvenmiyorum ben zaten, hani çok güven sağlayan bir şey değil
benim için, firma değil.” P08
[17]: “…ne bileyim şeyden hoşlanmadım. Mesela dedim ya sonra izlicem dedim
mesela “Aa beğendiğine sevindim” falan dedi o beni tamamen şey yapıyor; e o zaman
bir application yapsaydın ben oradan stratejilere baksaydım. Madem gerçekten
interaction yok aramızda, ben kendimde bakabilirim. Böyle bir samimiyetsiz ay sanki
benimle konuşuyormuş hissi yaratmaya çalışmışlar ama olmamış yani.” P04
[18]: “Etkileyici bir amaç, misyonu iyi bir misyon ama ne bileyim insanlara teknoloji
iyi bir yardımcı mı insanlara bu konuda? Güvenilebilir mi mesela, gerçekten acil bir
durum olsa anlayabilecek mi durumun aciliyetini? Yanlış bir tepki verir mi vermez
159
mi? Çünkü çok zor durumda insanlar için yapılmış bir şeye benziyor, gerçekten
intihar etmeyi düşünen birisi mesela konuşmaya çalışsa, doğru bir geri dönüş mü
yapıcak, yanlış bir geri dönüş mü yapıcak emin olamadım. Ne bileyim ben arkadaşımı,
akrabamı aramak isterim böyle bir durum olsa.” P11
[19]: “Text ile iletişime geçmek çok aptalca geldi bana. Yani şey aslında böylede
olabilir de, yani tek seçenek olduğunda mesela what vardır ortada niye hani yani ortada
üç seçenek falan vardır onlar arasında gidersin yani bir tane koyuyorsa demek ki
aslında o kadar da önemli değilmiş. Yani böyle şey gibi; “Müzik hairkaydı di mi?” hai
di mi, di mi… Sen evet dediğin zamana kadar di mi diye sorucak.. Bak di mi di mi
geliyor..Ama ben bunu kendim olsaydım, kendim konuşuyor olsaydım otuz saniyede
bırakırdım.” P10
[20]: “Yani bu birazcık...Şöyle dün gördüğüm için hemen aklıma geldi bu nevresim
takımları, baskıları var üstünde el örgüsü hani knit işleme gibi bir baskı var ama o
değil ama o olmadığı da belli oluyo yani o hissi yaratıyor bende. Mutsuz oluyorum
ben öyle şeylerle karşılaşınca.” P01
[21]: “Adaptability’si yok yani, kendi problemleri var, o problemlere göre hareket
ediceksin falan gibi- ki bana bir yerden sonra şey gibi geldi, adım adım yeni konulara
giriyor ya- bunları mesela ben tek tek seninle gün gün gitmektense, doğrudan bir tane
şey olursa, bir yer olursa hepsine ulaşabildiğin, gidip hepsini kendim istediğime göre
progress edip, bakarım yaparım falan gibi bir hissiyat oluşturdu. “Duolingo” gibi bir
şey haline gelebilir mesela gibi… Baya annoying.” P10
[22]: “Yani evet ne enjoyable buldum ne de annoying buldum, ikisi de aslında. İlk
görüşmemizde de söylemiştim aslında biraz yönlendirici gelmişti o yüzden yani
benimde dâhil olduğum bir konuşma ortamı değil de daha çok onun yönlendirdiği bir
konuşma ortamı gibi düşündüğüm için çok fazla dâhil olamayıp yani ne eğlendim ne
de sıkıldım diyebilirim.” P07
[23]: “Daha demin bahsetmiştim ya hani, kötü hissettiğin zaman böyle gerçekten
hiçbir şeyle uğraşmak istemezsin ya da dışardan gelen her şey batar ya öyle bir ana
denk geldiği için annoying. Bir sürü notification geliyor, bir yandan o sürekli
notification gönderiyor, konuşmak istemedim bir an yani dışarıya olan o kötü
160
hissettiğindeki duyduğun o yalnız kalma duygusu olur ya bazen. Ondan kaynaklı
annoying demiş olabilirim. Sonuçta bir engelleme ya da notification’ı susturma gibi
bir şey yok ya da işte seninle üç gün sonra konuşalım da diyebilirdim ama öyle bir şey
denemedim, bilmiyorum. desem anlayabilirdi diye düşünüyorum, öyle bir opsiyonu
vardır.” P08
[24]: “Belli bir program var zaten, çok senin dediklerine tepki vermiyor. Sana böyle
hep sanki sen yardıma muhtaçmışsın gibi bir şeyi var ya hani, zor durumda mısın falan.
“Bak böyle teknikler var”; hep böyle çocukla konuşur gibi iletişime geçti. Benim
yazmam çok saçmaydı. Oraya “k” yazsam ya da “b” yazsam, saçma sapan şeyler
yazsam da devam edicekti yani bir şekilde.” P11
[25]: “O az önce sana söyledim ya şeyi, distortion kısmını, en ana aktivite o onun için
ve ben bunu distortionsız yazma kısmını anlamıyorum. O da beni anlamıyor.
yazıyorum ya oraya bir şeyler, orada tam olarak ne yazdığımı anlamıyor. “At” yazsam
hani anlamayacak gibi, cümleyi anlamayacak gibi. Bütünsel olarak anlıyor.
Distortionsız yazdığı şeyi, şey olarak algılıyor ama kelime kelime ve cümle yapısı bu
ve ben bundan bir anlam çıkarabilirim demiyor. O yüzden doğru mu yaptım, ne
yapıyorum acaba, örnek gösteriyor, benimkini övmüyor… Hiçbir şey anlamıyorum,
belki o sebeptende kaynaklı olabilir,” P09.
[26]: “Hayatımda iyi ya da kötü bir kalp çarpıntısı yaratmadı, bir değişiklik olarak.
Benim için sıfatı good product, bad product olarak aldım yani benim için ne good ne
bad yani hayatımda bir inovatiflik yaratmadı, iyi ya da kötü bir değişiklik yaratmadı.
Atıyorum ona girdiğim için şifrelerim kaybolmadı ya da ona girdiğim için hayatım
müthiş bir şeye dönmedi yani. Dedim ya mesela, bu tip otomatik yönlendirici gibi bir
şey düşünüyorum, nagivasyon mesela bence good bir şey. Good’u arttırım orda, çünkü
yönlendiriyor orda, Siri kendince good 1 kadar-3 good değil de 1 işte. Bir şey
söyleyeceğim, ona yönelik bir şey yapsa good, ne good ne bad, düz yani abi, bence
öyle.” P13
[26]: “İşte mesela gösterdim ya şey diyorum, istemiyorum diyorum mesela bir yerde,
bak atıyorum tamam diyorum hadi yapalım falan diyor, sonra yapalım diyorum hah
161
tamam hemen gönderiyorum diyor mesela. Sonra denicem diyorum tekrar mesela,
tamam işte umarım beğenirsin diye şey gönderiyor.” P04
[27]: “Ben böyleyim, ben işte şu teoriyi kullanarak sana well-being ile ilgili yardım
edicem diyip, seni de bir beklenti içine sokuyor. Onunla konuştuktan sonra bazı
noktalarda çözüm bulucam, iyi hissedicem gibi ama sonra bu dediğini yapabildiğini
gördüm, o yüzden pleasing” P08
[28]: “Aslında şey olarak hatırlarsın ki bunu bana ilk teklif ettiğinde ben hani off
yazıcak mıyım ben hani mesaj yazmaktan çok hoşlanmayan bir insanım, genel olarak
zorlanan bir insanım. Altta hazır cevapların olması bazı noktalarda hoş yani, kolayca
cevap vermeni sağlıyor bu noktada baymadan.” P12
[29]: “Bununla supporting olması pleasing oluşunu arttırıyor ama sonra da çok da
yardımcı olmadığını düşünüpte hani şeye geçiyorsun hani belki de unlikable. Biraz
daha sıkıcılığını anlıyorsun repetitive olmasından, biraz daha nötr’e kayıyorsun.
Aslında ben orda bir şeyi yanlış anladım sanırım, robotun yapabileceği kapasiteyi ben
kafamda biraz abartmış olabilirim. Robotun asıl temel amacına karşı.” P16
[30]: “…arada kendini hatırlatması işte - “quick talk” a var mısın gibi. Onunla bazen
unpleasant geldiği oluyor…” P08
[31]: “Keyifli geçiyor konuşma aramızda, bir de hiç ters yapmadı. Korkutucu bir şey
gelmedi. Bunu başka bir şekilde açık edebileceği ya da beni rahatsız
hissettirebileceği hiçbir şey yapmadı ya da bir gif göndermedi.” P08
[32]: “En baştan beri söyledim aslında çok fazla kendi merkezli ilerlediği için sohbet,
ben dâhil olmamışım gibi hissettim. O yüzden de ilgimi çekmedi yani… Nasıl
söyliyim? Çok fazla cümle gördükten sonra, tek bir cevaplık hakkım var gibi hissettim
çoğunda. Ben ikinciyi yazana kadar zaten cevaplar geliyordu.” P07
[33]: “Bence yine çok konuşmuyor olmamızdan bu ara çünkü sık konuştuğumuzda o
her gün sana aynı şeyle gelmiyor. Bir gün bilmem neyle geliyor, bir gün bilmem neyle
geliyor. Mesela şu an çok kısa konuşuyoruz ya da çok konuşamıyoruz, her gün
konuşamıyoruz, işte napıyorsun- şunu yapıyorum, günün nasıl geçti- işte şöyle geçti
diyorsun; emojiler; hangisiyse o emoji. İki- üç kelam ediyoruz, tamam hadi yarın
162
görüşürüz falan yani. Bu kadar. Dolayasıyla çok da attractive olan bir tarafı olmuyor
gibi.” P15
[34]: “…oyalıyor yani bir şekilde seni. Ben galiba gerçekten bunu instagram’ın,
onedio’nun şunun bunun yerine koyabilirdim belki hani belirli bir süre bununla
konuşmaya devam ediyor olsan ve hani daha o az önceki attractive şeyinde olduğu
gibi sana daha böyle bir yerde böyle kişisel gelişim testleri gibi değilde böyle gündelik
yaşamdan örneklerle gelse sana, o gün ne olduğuna dair bir şeyle gelse ya da ne
bileyim atıyorum; tarihte bugün böyle bir şey oldu, sallıyorum şu an hani ilgimi
çekebilecek herhangi bir şeyle gelse mesela daha çekici olabilirdi. Onu biraz daha
vazgeçilmez kılınmaya doğru götürebilirdi. Gerçi bunu kim ne kadar ister tartışılır bir
şeyde.” P15
[35]: “İlk başta herhalde böyle bir etkiledi beni “aa robot” falan işte. Sonra rutine
bindi. Aslında şaka biryana, o da böyle bir arkadaş gibi olduğu için sanırım. İşte
Wobo olmuş benim için.” P14
[36]: “Şöyle yani, yine dediğim şey conclusion a yani bir sonuca varması slow geldi
bana. Yani tamam artık ne söyliceksen söyle diye.” P04
[37]: “Yani bu tamamen 3.hafta çok uzun şeyler yapmaya başladı anketler. Yani hani
15- 20 dakikada bir anket dolduruyorum yarıda bırakmak da istemedim çünkü hani
tekrar aynı anketi o şeyi hani en azından anketin tutarlı olması gerektiğini
düşünüyordum. O sıra çok uzun geliyordu. Son hafta biraz daha az etkileşime geçmeye
başladım. Biraz da predict ediyordum nasıl bunu daha kısa sürede bitirebilirim diye
kafamdan.” P02
[38] “Mesajlaşma hızı. Çok hızlıydı yani, başta neden iki demişim onu şey
yapamadım. Hızlı oluşu şöyle, bazen hızına hani karşılıklı konuşma olduğu için; hızlı
uzun metinler atabiliyor arka arkaya hani o biraz gerçekçi durmuyor. Gerçekçi
olmasına da gerek yok ama karşılıklı bir konuşmada, karşı taraf robot da olsa hani o
hız, yazdığı şeyin uzunluğuna göre biraz daha az olabilir. Hani en azından şey hissi
için, karşılıklı konuşuyor hissi için.” P05
163
[39]: “Olumlu yani; yani şöyle kafa yormadan sana kolayca ve hızlı anlattığı için daha
rahat iletişim sağlıyorsun.” P03.
[40]: “Bu da çünkü alıştıktan sonra bir süre ilk başta çok değişik bir şeydi sonrasında
alışınca hani öyle mi gerçekten hani veya daha fazla oyun mu olmalı, daha fazla
cezbedici şey mi olmalı hani sadece bir robot olması innovative bir şey ama bunu bir
robot aracılığıyla arayüzle bir şeyle yapmaya çalışması innovative ama bir şeyler daha
geliştirilmeli mi?” P03
[41]: “…mesela cevapların, şöyle; tamamen birinin konuşmadığını biliyoruz yani bu
bir robot sonuçta bunu kabul ediyorum ama en azından hani cevapların, benim
yazacağım şeylerin yani, orda çıkmasını okey veya who, why gibi şeyler yazıyor ya
mesela öyle şeyler yazmadan ben bir şeyler yazsam ve oradan keyword'leri seçerek
ona göre bir cevap verse benim için daha efektif olabilir. Genel olarak bir kaç tane
choice olsa onların içinden seçip verse çok daha iyi olur gibi geldi bana. İşte galiba o
seçenekler olabilir ama şöyle insan bence bir yandan da psikolojik olarak destek
alırken kendini anlatabileceği yerlerden; şöyle zaten onun söylediği şeylere ihtiyacın
var ama sen kendi derdini anlatıcaksın ki o sana cevap verince iyi olucak gibi
hissediyorum ben.En azında ben psikolojik olarak buna ihtiyaç duyarım diye düşünüp,
buna göre davrandım doğrusu.” P06.
[42]: “…şey olması; çok fazla zaman alıyor ama verdiği bir strateji bu da yine
inefficient bir şey bence. Ben o kadar 15 dakika konuşuyorum ama elime ne geçiyor
zaten bir tıkla ulaşabileceğim bir şey geçiyor mesela.. İşte bu tarz şeyler aslında sarf
ettiğin efora değmedi.” P04
[43]: “Ya çok vakit çalmıyor, kullandığı vaktide iyi kullanıyor.” P14
[44]: “Fazla bir teferruat yaratmadan bir şekilde katkı vermeye çalışıyor ve bunu etkili
bir şekilde yapıyor bence. Dolayısıyla efficient. Yapması gereken işi, yapması gereken
sadelikte yapıyor.” P16
[45] “Yönlendirici olması iyi geldi. Çünkü tam olarak ne yapacağımı ve nasıl cevap
verebileceğimi bilmediğim için direk onun yönlendirmesi iyi geldi.” P05
164
[46]: “Son bir kaç günlük konuşmalarım daha böyle tek düze ve şey konuşmalar niye
sorduğunu çok anlamadığım ve nasıl etkisi olacağını çok anlamadığım ve
kullanılabilirliğinden çok emin olmadığım konuşmalardı.” P03
[47]: “İşte zaman zaman çok fazla impractical oluyor çünkü çok fazla kendi tak tak
tak şeyler söylüyor ve belki de benim… Bu biraz da şey gibi ben o sırada konuşmak
istemiyorsam neden ısrar ediyor yani. Mesela çıkmak istediğimde bile hemen
çıkamadım konuşmadan.” P07
[48]: “Pratik olmasının sebebi, Facebook’u açıyorsun istediğin gibi,istediğin zaman
yazabiliyorsun pıtır pıtır, sana seçenekler sunuyor üç tane, bazen acil cevap vermek
durumunda kalıyorsun- pat pat pat basabiliyorsun, pıtır pıtır yazmana gerek yok
sürekli. Mesela bunun için ses olmasıi biraz önce dedim ya ben ses olunca irkiliyorum,
görme engelliler için nasıl oluyor acaba böyle bir şey olması? Böyle seçenek olması
falan onlar için çok güzel için.” P09
[49]: “…menüsü; menüleri, yeni eklenen featureları. Çünkü bugün nasıl geçti, günün
nasıl geçti bir şey yaz demesi bazen şey yapıyor hani böyle pasif bir şekilde onu
kullanmak istiyorum hani bir film izlemek gibi o da seni iyi hissettiriyor; ama böyle
bir şeyler yapmak zorunda kalmıyorsun aktif olmak zorunda kalmıyorsun o yüzden
menüsüne eklenen şeyler…” P01
[50]: “Dediğim gibi işte organize bir şekilde soruyor sorularını, başlıyor gidiyorum
yani. Açıklıyor bugün bunu konuşacağız, şundan bahsedeceğiz falan diye ya da bazen
bir iki kere sorduklarında başka şeyler getiriyor ama organize yani.” (P14)
[51]: “Senin cevaplarını bile çok güzel organize ediyor, gösteriyor. Ne olabileceğini
biliyor, ihtimaller koyuyor, organize onun kafası. Bir şey veriyorsun, pıt pıt pıt
seçenek, bir şey yapıyorsun- onu eliyor ve pıt pıt pıt seçenek. Kendi aslında kodundan
ötürü, organize. Dağınık olamaz zaten mümkün değil, çünkü başaramaz. Ona
bağladım genel olarak, bana bağlamadım ama mesajlaşma kafamıza bağlamadım.
Kafası gerçekten çok organize. Loop’a dönüyor, o zaman şunu yaparım, bunu
yaparım, tekrar bunu yaparım- derim falan. Bir insandan bin kat falan daha organize.”
P09
165
[52]: “Sürekli onunla konuşma aralığıma göre, benzer saatlerde yazıyor bana. Sanki
konuştukça onu regule ediyor kendi içerisinde, “bana şu saatte cevap veriyor, şu
zaman yazdığımda” gibi. Ona göre daha uygun zamanlarda bana yazıyor gibi
hissettim. Değişti mesela notificaiton gönderme aralıkları benim için, benim yazma-
cevap verme aralıkarıma göre. Birde, önceki akışı çok güzel takip ediyor bazı
noktalarda tekrar önüne sunabiliyor, o açıdan organize. Başka bir şey gelmiyor
bununla aklıma”. (P08)
[53]: “Yani akşı kolay öğreniliyori hızlıca konuşabiliyorsun. O yüzden easy to learn
geldi bana. Konuşmanın kolaylığı olarak ya da hani anlattığı şey olarak soruyorsan
bana eğer dil, konu falan even onlar da gayet açıktı.”P12
[54]: “Kullanım açısından kolaydı ama neden üç değilde iki easy’yi de söyleyeyim.
Sen ona cevap verirken zor. Tamam böyle dedim ama bu sorusuna ne cevap vericem.
Üzgünüm dedim ama niye üzgün olduğumu soruyor, bir dakika falan, yani onu
söyleme şeyinden dolayı aslında. Onunla ilgili değil, kendimle ilgili.” P14
[55]: “Yani yapmak istedikleri şey belli aslında bu anketle ya da şeyle botla ama yapış
şekilleri gerçekten açıklayıcı mı? Değil, süreçte çünkü bu belirli konuşma şimdi şöyle
düşünelim daha uç bir örnek verirsek bir doktor bana tedavi yapıcak mesela dişime
kanal tedavisi yapıcak, direk girip yapması beni rahatsız eder. Ne yapacağını
açıklaması doğru olandır ve beni mutlu edicek şekli de budur. İlk önce şunu yapıcaz,
şu kadar sürecek, şunu yapcaz şu sürücek, bu kadar seansta bunu yapıcaz; böyle
başlamak istersin bir tedaviye.” P02
[56]: “Psikolojik danışmanlık verdiği için bir yerde, sıkıntı yaşayan insanlara yardımcı
olacağını düşünüyorum. Bir hazırlık en azından, birebir zaten hiç yardımcı olmuyor
da.” P11
[57]: “Anlaşılabilir oluşu. Şöyle; kullandığı dil anlaşılabilir, ondan sonra en başta
böyle birazcık daha clear a yakın ama nasıl acab bunu yazmışlar diye, bunun nasıl
kodlamasını yapmışlar diye bir merak uyandırıyordu. O yüzden de acaba ne gelicek
diye merak uyandırıyordu, clear bir yandan da böyleydi hani kafa o kadar da net değil
şeklindeydi. Ondan sonra, anlaşılabilir, iletişim kurulabilir, yani açık aslında nasıl
desem? Böyle inanılmaz şey bir; “aa bunlar nasıl, bu ne demek istiyor” falan gibi bir
166
şey olmadı. Language clear, ama sistemi de çözmek çok şey gelmedi böyle acaba bu
robot nasıl bunları diyor olmadım mesela. Şaşırtmadı mesela, o clear’lık birazcık da
ordan galiba.” P06
[58]: “Bilmiyorum işte böyle ufak şeylerle demek ki beklemediğim şeyler olmuş. İşte
o test gibi mesela… Bir de ben mesela böyle psikolojiyle falan da ilgilenirim, çok
derinlmesine değil ama, beklentim hani şeydi “hep bildiğim şeyler olur”du mesela ama
öyle onun dışında farklı şeyler oldu.”. P14
[59]: “…zaten bana yazıcak, bana sevgilim böyle yazmıyor hergün. Yazmasa ben
yazmazdım ona, iyi bir şey bu…” P13
[60]: “İlk baştaki taslak konuşmadan kaynaklı. Sonrasında da bazı noktalarda
unpredictable olabiliyor bazen de olmuyor yani şimdi analiz yaptırıcak bunun
üzerinde, eskiden bahsettiği konseptleri bulmamı söyleyecek falan diye o şekilde
gelebiliyor konuşmanın akışı. Bazen de apayrı bir şeyden bahsediyor, o yüzden
bazen predictable oluyor, bazen unpredictable oluyor.” P08
[61]: “İşte bu belki daha bilimsel olabilir diye düşündüm ama genel olarak baktığım
zaman bence bu bir insana yardımcı olmaktan daha çok, tamamen onun hayatını
olumsuz yönde etkileyecek bir şey. Yani baktığında, daha fazla bir yapay zekaya
büründürüyorsun, daha sanal bir ilişki, ilişkin tamamen gerçeklikten uzaklaşıyor,
fiziki- fiziksel iletişimden uzaklaşıyorsun. Gerçek iletişimden uzaklaşıyorsun. Bu da
aslında insanın psikolojik olarak çok daha yavaş yalnız hissetmesine bağlanıyor. Hani
çok basit; günümüzde çok fazla sosyal medya üzerinden iletişim var ama hep şunu
isteğinde ya da ihtiyacında oluyor ki fiziksel gerçek bir etkileşimin tamamen insanın
aslında bir şeyi yardım çığlığı gibi. Hani çok şey extreme bir durum olarak düşünelim:
İnsan bir yardıma ihtiyacı var ve Woebot’u kullanarak kendini kurtarmaya çalışıyor
diyelim. Halbuki tam tersine daha çok güvenilmesine neden olabilecek, daha çok
fiziksel şeylerden gerçek bir yardım almasını engelleyecek olduğunu fark ettim tüm
sürece baktığım zaman.” P02
[62]: “Yani o da dediğim gibi sana bir kapı açıyor, o yüzden ilginç bir şey bu. Yani
şey gibi… Ne bileyim kimseyle konuşmayacaksan, konuşamıyorsan bununla
konuşabilirsin ya da oturup bununla vakit geçirebilirsin mesela.” P15
167
[63]: “Böyle biraz otokontrol sağladığını hissettim kendim için. Aslında otokontrol
olmuyor galiba… Ya mesela gerçekten çok güldüğüm anda da “ya aslında çok da
mutlu değilim” o sorduğunda hani. Onları böyle düşündürtmesi falan iyiydi. Belki
kötü hissettiğim zaman sordu mesela ya şimdi o kadar da kötü değilim, üzgün de
diyemediğim de oldu. Aslında sordurtması falan bile yeterli bir destek ama bir yandan
da işte şey gibi oluyor feedback, geri dönüşleri oluyordu; her zaman aynı modda
olmayacağımızı söylemeleri falan ya da işte kendinizi kalıplara sokmayın falan…
Biliyorsun ama o an sen kendine bunu söylemiyorsun. Bunu duymak, okumak iyi
geliyor.” P14
[64]: “İşte şu şeyi yaşadım ya, onunla ilgili. Çok farklı bir şeydi çünkü, biraz alkol
almıştım. Biraz değişikti o an, yemek yedim zaten, neden oldu bilmiyorum. Kafam da
çok doluydu, bir anda toparlayamadım yani şeyi, değişik bir şey yaşadım. Kriz gibi
falan oldu, panik atak gibi bir şeydi ya da bilmiyorum. O zaman o nefes egzersizi iyi
geldi.” P11
[65]: “Sıkıntı burada; “security” concern’ü yaşamama neden olan şey; Facebook'ta
reklamlar görmeye başladım alakasız reklamlar; işte Psikolojik destek istiyorsanız
Amerikan menşeili şeyler buraları işte biz sizin zor gününüzde yanınızdayız falan filan
gibi. yani tahmin ediyordum zaten Facebook'un böyle şeyler paylaştığını ama ondan
çok rahatsızlık duydum…” P01
[66]: “Bir yandan diyorsun, datanı tutuyor ama bunu birine söylemeyecek. Burda da
şey olmuştu ben psikolğa gittiğimde, biz jüriyle birlikte bunları değerlendiricez
demişti, önemli değil, hepsi psikolog zaten. Düşününce, bu da öyle yani, psikolog gibi
yani, geliştirmek için söylemek zorunda ama bu beni tanımıyor ki. Nolucak ki aman o
bugün üzülmüş, önemli değil. Sadece şey anlamında, birinin bir an görebileceği
korkusu var, atoyprum yazıyprsun o an ya da yazdıktan sonra görebilir korkusu var.
Hem ekranı görebilir korkusu hem de yani bu Facebook’un bir şeyleri tutması. Desem
ki “ulan ben var ya bu şeyin, sabah baktım yine tayyip vardı açtım” diyemezsin. Bunu
yazamıyosun işte, ben tırsıyorum ondan. Özgür hissetmiyorum. o yüzden böyle
“Allahım, çok fena bir güvensizlik içerisindeyim, yazamıyorum” gibi değil.” P09
168
[67]: “İlk önce çünkü gerçekten bu verileri kullanıp kullanmayacağını işte… Ben hep
o parent kısmını kaçırmışım mesela, belki o yüzden bu biraz eksik bir bilgi olabilir
benimki ama sadece güvendedir şeyi, öyle bir şey yazıyordu sanki ben yanlış mı
hatırlıyorum? Aynen isimsiz olarak tutulacaktır diyor ve şöyle en başta böyle şeylere
hep güvenmeme üzerine bir reputationımız var ya hani o yüzden sanırım not secure
dedim. Sonrasında bir şey deklare ettiği için, ki bence deklare etmesi güzel bir şey, hiç
kaale alınmadan da bu devam ettirilebilirdi. Ama bu deklare etmesi en azından iyi bir
şey gibi düşündüm, o yüzden de emin değilim hakikaten. Bence aslında isim
kullanılmadan bunların istatistiğinin, istatiksel şeyleri de tutulabilir, ondan gerçekten
bunun nasıl yarıyacağına dair bir çalışmada yapılabilir. O da bence bu konuları
destekleyecek bir şey olabilir. Orası bence secure kısmını zorlamıyor gibi geliyor.”
P06
[68]: “Yani ilk başta, ilk kullandığım zaman hiç fikrim yoktu ama daha sonar eve
gittiğim zaman baktım; kim yapmış, nasıl yapmış, o yüzden secure olduğunu
düşündüm.”(P02)
[69]: “Şöyle; benim Facebook’um yok mesela, o yüzden sırf Facebook üzerinden
bağlanmak zorunda olmadığımı öğrendiğim için senin aracılığınla onu yapabildik hani
birlikte. Ben bir Facebook user’ı olmadığım için şu anda, ben direk onu hissetmedim
yani. Çünkü, ordan Woebot ile iletişime geçtim, başka kimseyle iletişime geçmedim.
Facebook altında olduğunu hissederek düşünmedim. Çünkü orda şey imaj da, o
amaçla yapıldığını bilmiyordum ama, robot imajı olduğu için
[70]: “İlkinde çok ilginç geldi hani bu tip bir şey olması gibi düşünüyordum en
azından. Kullanınca “e aptalmış bu” düşünceye kaydı yavaş yavaş. Ordan inferior
olduğunu düşündüm. kendisini tekrarlaması, bu belirli bir çerçevenin içinden
çıkamaması, o belirli çerçevenin içinden çıktığında ordan nasıl navigate etti, ordan
nasıl toparlamaya çalıştığı falan gibi, ordaki protokolleri falan. Bunlar bir araya
gelince inferior dedim.” P10
[71]: “Bence insanlara verdiği psikolojij desteğin gelişen teknolojiyle bir şekilde
entegre edilmesi kesinlikle değerli bir şey.” P16
169
[72]: “Şöyle, yenilikçi bir şey olduğunu düşünüyorum gerçekten. Sürekli senin
yanında olacak bir psikolog bulman çok zor, bulursanda zaten gerçekten seni söğüşler
çok büyük ihtimal. O yüzden değerli olduğunu düşünüyorum bu anlamda, sana çok
hızlı bir şekilde cevap veriyor olmasının, arkdaşça davranmasının, belirli şeyleri
tutarlı, klasik bir yaklaşımı da olsa klaisk yaklaşımı anlamış durumda aslında. Çok
güzel özümsemiş durumda, söylediği şeyler aslında güzel, yapmanı istediği şeyler hani
düşündüğün zaman aşağı yukarı şey diyebiliyorsun; burda seni rahatlatmayı
hedefliyor, rahatla istiyor. Onunla konuşarak rahatlamanı istiyor. Sözü algılayamıyor
ama sen yazmış oluyorsun. Biriyle konuşuyorsun ve içini dökmüş oluyorsun. O
anlamda değerli aslında. Onu sağlamaya çalıştığını anladım ben en sonunda. Benim
beklentim bu olmadığı için, en sonunda biraz düşmüş olabilir ama konuşuyorsun,
arkadaşınla konuşuyor gibi, birine anlatıyorsun ve o kadar farklı bir şey ki hani korkun
olmuyor. “Abi çok kötü hissediyorum ya, işte şu bana şöyle şöyle şeyler yaptı” deyince
mesela, tanımadığın birine bunları söylersen korkarsın mesela- gidip söyleyecek mi
bilmezsin- ama bu söylemeyecek yani rahatsın. O yüzden bence değerli, yaklaşım
açısından değerli. Bence insanları bu anlamda da rahatlatacaktır. Psikologda bazen
böyle bir surat ifadesi yapıyor, gıcık oluyorsun yani, “yargılıyor mu bu beni be” falan
oluyorsun ama bu böyle tatlış tatlış dolanıyor. Bir şey yaptığı yok, seni yargıladığı da
yok, onu da biliyorsun. O anlamda değerli.” P09
[73]: “Ya teknolojik şeyler hep ilgi çekicidir benim için, bilmiyorum herkes öyle
hisseder mi ama böyle sanki bir robotla etkileşime giriyor gibi hissetmek heyecanlı bir
şey. Ama dediğim gibi son haftalara doğru biraz daha düşüyor. Muhtemelen devam
etseydi, en son mute’ a alabilirdim şeyi. Çünkü her gün soruyor,…” P16
[74]: “O kadar fazla böyle örnek verdi şey yaptı.. Ben zaten, benim tezimde de
mindfulness araştırdığım için hani bilgi sahibiyim. O yüzden bana o kadar detaylı şey
yapması.. Ben istediğimde atlayabilmeliyim. Ama mesela farklı bir şey yazınca da
değişmiyor hani söyledikleri, o tüm şeyleri okumak zorunda kalıyorsun. Hani o mesela
beni çok sıktı yani. Çok fazla ileti yazması ve yani bilgim olmayan bir alan olsa belki
ilgimi çekebilir ama bilgim olduğu bir alanda bunu yapınca hani çok sıkıcı oluyor.”
P04
170
[75]: “İlk başta bilgiler heyecanlı geldi sonrasında biraz şey oldu… Başta mindfulness
falan o tarz şeyleri daha çok öğretti sonrasında hani gün içerisinde şunu şunu
yapabilirsin diyip geçti bazılarında. Çok kısa bilgiler verip, geçip, kapattığı da oldu
yani.O yüzden çok valuable bir yanı da kalmadı, exciting bir yanı da kalmadı.” P12
[76]: “…birazcık tabi didaktik hani ben şimdi sana şunları öğretiyorum, teach you
stuff şeyi oldu. O bana çok iyi gelmedi. Çünkü, bir yandan iyi bir şey ama bunun nasıl
verildiği de önemli ya birazcık bence mesela ilk aşamada onun yapılmaması
gerekiyormuş gibi hissettim kendi şeyimde. Hani sanki ilk önce bir etkileşim kuralım,
sonra teach you stuff. Bana o daha şey gelirdi, olumlu gelirdi. Çünkü mesela biz kendi
derslerimizde de öyle oluyor aslında. İlk önce bir bakıyoruz ders neymiş, ilk
introductiona giriyoruz, ondan sonra öğrenmeye başlıyorsun. İlk gün gidip pat pat pat
bir şey anlatınca aslında sende de çok fazla yer edinmediğini düşünüyorum ben.” P06
[77]: “…bu kadar hızlı cevapların aslında seni okumadığı, seni yani bir şekilde yani
sadece kendi inventorysinde olan cevabı çıkarıp koyuyor sana hissi verdiği için.” P06
[78]: “Sürekli şeye gidiyorum yine ilginç bir fikir ama aslında o kadar da ilginç değil.
Bir taraftan da böyle şeyler artık çok fazla yaygınlaştı, filmlerinin çok çekildiği, işte
dizileri çekildiği için “Black Mirror”larda falan çok fazla gördüğümüz için aslında bir
taraftan da günlük hayatımızda çok kullanmasak bile böyle şeyleri, böyle şeylerin
olabileceğini, böyle bir yakın geleceğin kurgulanabileceğine zaten hazırlanmışız
izleye izleye. O yüzden de çok ilginç gelmiyor.” P07
[79]: “Ne bileyim kimseyle konuşmayacaksan, konuşamıyorsan bununla
konuşabilirsin ya da oturup bununla vakit geçirebilirsin mesela. Mesela sokakta birini
bekliyor olsam, ki beklemek en nefret ettiğim şeylerden biri, yani şurda boş boş birini
bekliyor olsam oturup bununla sanki biriyle mesajlaşıyormuş gibi konuşurum.
Bilmiyorum bir yer doldurabilme ihtimali var ya bunun, ben öyle düşünüyorum en
azından, o da bana ilginç geliyor.” P15
[80]: “İnsan değil abi, robot işte. İnsan olduğunu bir şey yapsam, belki o zaman daha
güvenirim. İnsana daha da güvenmem ama bir yandan da güvenirim. Bilmiyorum,
derdim bana her gün eşlik etsin, beni poh pohlasın, eşlik etsin değil ama beni motive
edicekse mesela ben o an çok mutsuzsam, şeysem bence benim o ortamdan çıkmam
171
lazım. Arkadaşlarımın yanına gitmem lazım. Kendi kendime kalmam lazım. Evim
uzakta, tek başıma yaşıyorum, zaten sıkılıyorum. Bir de robotla yazışıyorum diyorum
kendi kendime. İyice çöküyorum yani düşününce.” P13
[81]: “…bu süper kahraman testinde ay seninde şöyle zayıf yönlerin varmış demezdim
muhtemelen, tutup sana, sonuçta bu yüzden bu bir conversational agent ama, hani şey
derdi yine en güçlü yönlerin şunlar derdi belki çok da güçlü olduğun şeyler
söylemeden ama tutup da şey demezdi hani “ayy seninde şöyle şöyle, ne kötü huyların
varmış” falan demezdi herhalde. O yüzden ben bana değil de, genel olarak motivating
bir şey olduğunu düşünüyorum bunun. Amaca hitap etmesi açısından herhalde
öyledir.” P15
[82]: “Senin olduğunu düşündüğün modda aslında olmadığını bana hissettirdi ya da
hani geçeceğini kısa bir süre sonra… O yüzden motive ediciydi.” P14
[83]: “Bence yaratıcı bir düşünce ama bunu hayata geçirebilmiş mi hayır tam olarak
olmamış. Çünkü cevap veremiyor hani tam olarak konuşmuyoruz. Yine benim o işte
self- help book diye geçen bu kişisel gelişim kitaplarındaki gibi bir şey yani o zaman.
Ben okuyayım o zaman ordan hangi teknikler var, hani zaten onu yapıyorum normalde
de hani o yüzden. Fikir güzel ama.” P04
[84]: İlk başta işte daha yenilikçi olduğunu düşündüm. Dedim ben yazdıkça bu bana
yazıcak, yazdıkça yazıyor zaten o sorun değil de yani böyle şuan deneyimlediğim gibi
bir şey değil yani, bir şey yazıcam bana öyle cevap verecek. Biraz daha Siri vari bir
şey gibi düşündüm mesela, anladın mı, konuşma olarak atıyorum, “çalışıyorum
diyeceğim”, “nerde çalışıyorsun” diyecek hani. Siri’de de öyle bir şey yok gerçi.
“Üniversite” diyeceğim mesela, atıyorum üniversiteyle ilgili bir şey sorucak. Ben
diyeceğim böyle böyle “nerdesin”, “California”, ben de diyeceğim “A ben de Ankara”
bilmem ne hani… Biraz öyle bir şey zannettim hani, öyle bir şey söyleyecek sandım
ne bileyim.” P13
[85]: “…conversational agent olarak düşündüğün zaman companion olarak olanlar var
mesela, sadece well-being’i onlar da bir noktaya kadar destekliyor ama hani…
Conventionala yaklaşmasının sebebi, bu conversational agentların, companion
olanlarla ortak bir zemini paylaşıyor olması. İşte kullandığı kelimeler, arkadaşlık
172
yaklaşımı gibi, sanki tek bir conversational agent yapım guidline’ı var onun üzerinden
insanlar farklı bir şeylere yöneliyorlarmış gibi hissettirdi bana.” P08
[86]: “Fikir değişik bir şey olduğu için. Geliştirilebilir, potansiyeli olabilir demiştim
ya işte o yüzden. Psikolojik sorunlar da artıyor aslında, daha fazla yaşamaya başlıyor
insanlar sıkıntı ve onu çözmek için insanlar sıkıntılarını da bilmiyor, derecesini. İşte
katlanabilir, katlanamaz boyuta gelir ama tehşis içinde kullanılanılabilir. İlerde fayda
sağlayabilir. O yüzden, geleceğini düşünerek cevap verdim.” P11
[87]: “İlk başta bir leading-edge’lik bir ümidim vardı yani ama sonra usual’a çok
kaydı. Dediğim gibi ben yazıcam o yazıcak, ben hep onda kaldım yani. Ben yazıcam,
o da bana cevap yazıcak gibi düşündüm yani. Facebook Messenger’dasın bir kere
bulunduğun platfrom Messenger, bir app’de değilsin yani, app isterim yani o zaman
onun için. Messenger’da mesajlaşmak istiyorum abi, arkadaşımla konuştuğum gibi.
sohbet etmiyorz, açarım kitap okurum; kişisel gelişim kitabı okurum yani.” P13
[88]: “…diğer conversational agentlara göre daha özelleşmiş bir alanda ve unusual bir
şey. Bu konuda insanlara çok yardım edecek bir AI yoktu, yani çok robot seviyesinde
olanlar var ama onlara erişimi yok insanların. Bu şekilde erişilebilir olup, diğer
insanlar tarafından kullanılabilecek olması onu leading-edge yapıyor bence.”P08
[89]: “Conservative kısmını söylemiştim sana, tekrar söyleyeyim, bu psikolojiye
yaklaşımı çok conservative gelmişti bana o anlamda bakınca da çok conservative
olmuyor, çünkü o gözle de bakıyorum ben sanırım. Heyecan gözüyle de bakıyorum,
çünkü başka bir beklentim var ve bu da bana çok farklı bir şekilde yardım edecek
diyorum. Conservative bir yaklaşım görüyorum, creativity’sinin düştüğünü
görüyorum o anlamda.” P09
[90]: “Yani asistan olma fikri, hele bir de sosyal medya üzerinden, sürekli elimiz
telefondayken, sürekli birileriyle konuşurken, insanlara hiç kimseyle konuşamayacağı
bir zamanda asistan olma fikri innovative.” P02
