Keywords: Background: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted access to treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs), while
COVID-19 pandemic alcohol and cannabis retail sales increased. During the pandemic, we tested a tailored digital health solution,
Artificial intelligence Woebot-SUDs (W-SUDs), for reducing substance misuse.
Substance-related disorders
Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, we compared W-SUDs for 8 weeks to a waitlist control. U.S. adults (N
Randomized controlled trial =180) who screened positive for substance misuse (CAGE-AID>1) were enrolled June–August 2020. The pri-

mary outcome was the change in past-month substance use occasions from baseline to end-of-treatment (EOT).
Study retention was 84%. General linear models tested group differences in baseline-to-EOT change scores,
adjusting for baseline differences and attrition.
Results: At baseline, the sample (age M =40, SD =12, 65% female, 68% non-Hispanic white) averaged 30.2 (SD
=18.6) substance occasions in the past month. Most (77%) reported alcohol problems, 28% cannabis, and 45%

would recommend W-SUDs. Relative to waitlist, W-SUDs participants significantly reduced past-month substance
use occasions (M =(cid:0) 9.1, SE =2.0 vs. M =(cid:0) 3.3, SE =1.8; p =.039). Secondary substance use and mood
outcomes did not change significantly by group; however, reductions in substance use occasions correlated
significantly with increased confidence and fewer substance use problems, cravings, depression and anxiety
symptoms, and pandemic-related mental health effects (p-value<.05).
Conclusions: W-SUDs was associated with significant reductions in substance use occasions. Reduction in sub-
stance use occasions was associated with better outcomes, including improved mental health. W-SUDs satis-
faction was high.

Note: All dependent variables are changes scores calculated as EOT – baseline. General Linear Models were run to test for group differences adjusting for baseline
differences (CAGE-AID and DAST-10) and applying weighted least squares analyses to adjust for differential retention. Weights were calculated as the inverse of
predicted probability values from a logistic regression model of retention at EOT. The logistic regression model included baseline measures univariately associated with
retention: non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity, college degree, craving, pain interference, and pandemic mental health effects. Eta2 =0.01 indicates a small effect; Eta2
