Abstract
Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety, suicidal ideation, and self-harm have escalated among adolescents to crisis
levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, primary care providers (PCPs) are often called on to provide first-line care
for these youth. Digital health interventions can extend mental health specialty care, but few are evidence based. We evaluated
the feasibility of delivering an evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) app with an embedded conversational agent to deliver
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to symptomatic adolescents presenting in primary care settings during the pandemic.
Objective: In this 12-week pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility of delivering the app-based intervention to adolescents aged
13 to 17 years with moderate depressive symptoms who were treated in a practice-based research network (PBRN) of academically
affiliated primary care clinics. We also obtained preliminary estimates of app acceptability, effectiveness, and usability.
Methods: This small, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated depressive symptom severity in adolescents randomized
to the app or to a wait list control condition. The primary end point was depression severity at 4-weeks, measured by the 9-item
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Data on acceptability, feasibility, and usability were collected from adolescents and their
parent or legal guardian. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 PCPs from 11 PBRN clinics to identify facilitators and
barriers to incorporating mental health apps in treatment planning for adolescents with depression and anxiety.
Results: The pilot randomized 18 participants to the app (n=10, 56%) or to a wait list control condition (n=8, 44%); 17 participants
were included in the analysis, and 1 became ineligible upon chart review due to lack of eligibility based on documented diagnosis.
The overall sample was predominantly female (15/17, 88%), White (15/17, 88%), and privately insured (15/17, 88%). Mean
PHQ-9 scores at 4 weeks decreased by 3.3 points in the active treatment group (representing a shift in mean depression score
from moderate to mild symptom severity categories) and 2 points in the wait list control group (no shift in symptom severity
category). Teen- and parent-reported usability, feasibility, and acceptability of the app was high. PCPs reported preference for
introducing mHealth interventions like the one in this study early in the course of care for individuals presenting with mild or
moderate symptoms.
Conclusions: In this small study, we demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety of using a CBT-based
chatbot for adolescents presenting with moderate depressive symptoms in a network of PBRN-based primary care clinics. This
pilot study could not establish effectiveness, but our results suggest that further study in a larger pediatric population is warranted.
Future study inclusive of rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and underrepresented communities is needed to establish
generalizability of effectiveness and identify implementation-related adaptations needed to promote broader uptake in pediatric
primary care.
