Technological advancements re-shaped user-product interactions by enabling people 
to make conversation with interactive systems. This new form of interaction led 
designers to create a new type of user interface: Conversational User Interface (CUI). 
Expensive psychological therapy fees and people’s increased awareness related to 
importance of well-being attracted the interactive system developers to create a 
is particularly focusing on 
domain specific Conversational Agent, which 
psychological terapy and has CUI. In order to maintain user engagement and sustain 
usage, design of such systems is important. However, existing design guidelines for 
Conversational Agents are limited and focus on business functions of these agents; 
however, conversational experience should be the main focus for designers to sustain 
user engagement and support people’s well-being. 
The aim of this research is to explore design qualities of Conversational Agent’s that 
focuses on enhancing people’s subjective well-being, to accomplish sustained usage 
and engagement with the conversational agent and propose guidance for designing 
such agents. For this purpose, interviews were conducted with users. Woebot, a 
Conversational Agent, which is designed for promoting people’s subjective well-being 
was selected as a case for the study and evaluated by 16 participants. The 
interpretations of the participants were obtained by semi- structured and in-depth 
interviews. Through analysing the results of the interviews, improvement suggestions 
are presented regarding system operations and functionality in terms of its 
attractiveness, perspicuity, effectiveness, stimulation, dependability, efficiency and 
novelty. Lastly, the study provides insights that would affect users’ engagement and 
overall experience.

Teknolojik gelişmeler, insanların interaktif sistemlerle sohbet etmelerini sağlayarak 
kullanıcı etkileşimlerini yeniden şekillendirdi. Bu yeni etkileşim türü, tasarımcıları 
Konuşma Kullanıcı Arayüzü (Conversational User Interface - CUI) adı verilen yeni 
bir kullanıcı arayüzü tasarlamaya yönlendirdi. Pahalı psikolojik terapi ücretleri ve 
insanların öznel iyi oluşun önemi hakkında farkındalığının oluşması, interaktif sistem 
geliştiricilerinin bu tür terapiye odaklanan ve Konuşma Kullanıcı Arayüzüne sahip 
olan alana özelleşmiş sohbet aracısı tasarlama konusunda ilgilerini çekti. Kullanıcı 
bağlılığını sağlamak ve kullanımı sürdürülebilir hale getirmek için bu sistemlerin 
tasarımı önemlidir. Ancak, var olan sohbet aracısı tasarım kıstasları sohbet aracılarının 
ticaret özelliklerine odaklanmış durumda ve sınırlı sayıdadır. Hâlbuki sohbet 
deneyimi, kullanıcı bağlılığını ve insanların öznel iyi oluşlarını sürdürebilmek için 
tasarımcıların asıl odağı olmalıdır. 
Bu araştırmanın amacı sohbet aracılarının kullanıcı bağlılıklarını sürdürmek ve bu 
aracıları tasarlamak için kıstaslar oluşturmak için insanların öznel iyi oluşlarını 
geliştirmeye odaklanan sohbet aracılarının tasarım özelliklerini keşfetmektir. Bu 
gayeyle, kullanıcılarla mülakatlar yapıldı. İnsanların öznel iyi oluşlarına katkıda 
bulunmayı amaçlayan bir sohbet aracısı olan Woebot bu çalışma için konu olarak 
seçildi ve 16 katılımcı tarafından değerlendirildi. Katılımcıların yorumları, yarı 
yapılandırılmış ve detaylı mülakatlarla elde edildi. Çalışmada, mülakatların sonuçları 
değerlendirilerek, çekicilik, açıklık, etkililik, uyarıcılık, güvenirlebilirlik, verimlilik ve 
orijinallik bakımından sistem operasyonları ve işlevselliğine ilişkin geliştirme 
önerileri sunuldu. Son olarak bu çalışma, kullanıcının bağlılığını ve tüm deneyimini 
nelerin önemli biçimde etkilediğine dair içgörüleri sağladı.

o Which design aspects and qualities do maintain user engagement? 
o What motivates people to sustain usage? 
o of the conversational agent to support user’s subjective well-being? 


 There are general principles provided by guidelines from prominent authors, such as 
Nielsen (1993) and Shneiderman (2004); there are international standards which focuses on 
such guidelines, such as ISO/DIS 9241-16:1996(E); and there are styleguides for companies 
such as Interface Guidelines for Windows and Apple. 
 Such as these books: “The Conversational Interface: Talking to Smart Devices (McTear et 
al., 2016)”, “Designing Voice User Interfaces (Pearl, 2016)”, “Designing Bots (Shevat, 
2017)”

 “I mean, I dance. I tried to feel good by doing an event such as going dancing 
and get discharged. I try to formulate a strategy to forget things by physical 
activities such as sports which is generally dancing for me.” P06 [1]1 

















 




























 
“I have read a book about concentration techniques. It was saying that 
focusing on one activity is better than doing many activities at the same 
time to control your body. There were some techniques like not moving, 
not moving at all for five minutes. It really makes me relaxed. I do such 
activities. I mean I don’t move at all for 5-10 minutes. It is really hard but 
it makes you relaxed tremendously. Moreover, you’re not having any 
thoughts at all. You don’t think, you push yourself. This is extremely 
relaxing. I do this activities. When I don’t do some of my body parts are 
strained such as my legs, feet, etc. which bothers me. This thing also made 
me obsessed with it.” P11 [2] 





















 
“…talking with my beloved ones, having some time with them which helps me 
to get over.” P16 [3] 


“Family relations such as supporting each other make me feel better. I texted my 
family: ‘good morning my dear family…’ this morning to sustain these relations 
with them.” P04 [4] 














“I re-plan to feel better. I mean I did good things to feel good but still I mean 
this for the things that I wanted to but I couldn’t.” P11. [5] 





 






“Generally speaking, if I feel bad, if this is the question you ask, I try to solve it 
myself. I would take myself off for couple of days. I wouldn’t see anyone. I 
would cancel my social life and searching for solutions to my problem and solve 
things that I can. For example, if there is a problem with my job, I wouldn’t thing 
anything else for 3-4 days and try to think solution oriented.” P02 [7] 





(Not being able to receive payment for conference application) “What did I do? 
I tried to console myself. That means I should not care too much. I learned that 
I am going to a conference in Barcelona. I haven’t taken a holiday for a year. I’ll 
go to there and do my presentation, I’ll wander around for 5 days, meet new 
people. Then, I said it’s alright. This is it. I relieved myself.” P15 [8] 





 
 
 
“If it is something that I can’t solve such as something that government did, I 
don’t really care. It might make me unhappy and I still follow these news but I 
don’t care.” P02 [9]

“Would it feel same like a relation with an actual person? It might be. However, 
it might make people anti-social, that’s another topic. I am already really 
conservative about my friends, I am not eager to make new friends. I prefer to 

 
 
continue with existing ones. I am still on some level about friendships but it 
might make anti-social people even more anti-social.”P16 [11] 











“Being able to be with it 7 24 is an advantage because panic attack sufferers 
might need it any moment even though I don’t consider myself as a panic attack 
sufferer. You can talk with it any moment. For example, in an emergency, it 
might say something like ‘take a deep breath’. It might make you relaxed and 
let things go. It might do something good like these. It can be with you 7 24. 
That’s a good thing. It might help you when you’re in depression or you are 
having depressive moment.” P09 [12] 












 
 
 
 







“It had my attention because I liked the ‘track your mood’ feature. For example 
if my mood is spoiled I generally think the moment but not the process or the 
past. I like how it shows your mood weekly. I can say it attracted me.” P03 [14] 



“I tried some app like this which wasn’t a bot. Real people reply you. It is called 
‘Talk Life’. That one doesn’t control your mood. I liked how this track your 
mood. I found it smart.” P14 [15]

“Maybe it will suggest something because it is related with a university: 
Stanford. Maybe they can reach a lot of people’s data. It says it will keep the 
data secret but maybe they can reach anonymously. I don’t trust anyone about 
the data thing. At the end we talk via Facebook. The data’s path is on Facebook. 
I don’t trust Facebook at all. It is not a trustworthy company.” P08 [16] 


 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 














“The goal is impressive. Cause is a good cause but does technology help people

understand the importance of the situation? Would it react wrong or not? I am 
asking this because it seems like it is developed for people who are in desperate 
situations. For example, could it give a correct feedback for suicidal people? O 
am not sure of that! I would call my relatives or friends in a moment of like this.” 
P11 [18] 










 




“I found the idea of texting with it very stupid. I mean it can be like this but 
when it suggest only one option then I understand that it wasn’t really important 
at all. I mean it is like asking if the music was good. ‘Was it good? Was it? Was 
it?’ It will ask till you reply ‘yes.’ Look, ‘Was it?’s are coming. I would stop 
talking to this if it was for myself.” P10 [19]

“It is not adaptable. It has its own problems. I felt like it will make you act for 
those problems. The fact that it is moving to another topics step by step made 
me feel like they are like something that I can reach one by one and progress 
myself. It might end up something like ‘Duolingo’ which is really annoying.”

 “I mean I did find it neither enjoyable nor annoying or it is actually both. I told 
you this in our first interview that I found it directive rather than creating a chat 
environment that I involve. It is more like it is directing the chat which makes 
me excluded. That’s why I neither got bored nor enjoyed.” P07 [21] 

thoughts freely, excessive notification sending and excessive length of the responses

“As I just said, you don’t want to see anything from outside or work with 
anything when you feel bad. This runs into those moments and that’s why it is 
annoying. A lot of notifications are coming and also it sends a lot of 
notifications. I didn’t want to talk for a moment like the feeling of lonliness when 
you feel bad. Maybe that’s why I said it is annoying. At the end, it doesn’t give 
you a choice to shut the notifications. I could have said that I wanted to talk 3 
days later but I didn’t. Maybe it would have understood. I think it has such 
option.” P08 [22] 






 
 
 




“It has predetermined programme. It doesn’t reply what you said. It acts like you 
are always in need of help or in a desperate situation. ‘There is such 
techniques…’ said the bot like it was talking to a child. It was nonsense to write. 
Even if I wrote ‘K’, ‘B’ or any random word it was going to continue anyway.” 
P11 [23] 









 
 


“Like I said before about the distortion part, it was the main activity for it and I 
didn’t quite understand about writing without distortion. It doesn’t understand 
me, too. I write something but it doesn’t exactly understand what I just wrote. It 
seems like it won’t understand if I write ‘horse’ or my sentence. It understands 
in holistically. It understands the thing it wrote with distortion but it doesn’t 
understand word by word or the sentence structure. That’s why It shows what I 
did, what I am doing but it doesn’t praise mine… I don’t understand anything. 
Maybe that’s the reason” P09. [24] 




















 
 
 
 
 
 
“It didn’t make any good or bad in my life, as a change. I took adjective as a 
good product and bad product. I mean it didn’t make any innovation as good or 
bad in my life, it didn’t change my life any good or bad. For example, I didn’t 
forget my passwords because I used it or it didn’t make my life perfect. As I 
said, for example, I think something automatic directing such as navigation is a 
good thing. I would increase ‘good’ for navigation because it directs you. Siri is 
good, I mean. It is not 3 level good but it is 1 level. If it did something about 
what I say it would be good. This is neither good nor bad. I think it is dull, I 
mean according to me.” P13 [25] 





























 
 
 
 
 








“As I showed, I say I don’t want it and it says ‘let’s do it!’. Then I say let’s do it 
and it says ‘Alright! I’m just sending you!’ I say I will try it later, and it says 
‘Alright! I hope you like it!’.” P04 [26] 






 
 





 
 
 








“It says ‘I am like this. I can help you about well-being by using this theory.’ 
and it makes you hope like you feel like you will find a solutions about some 
points or you will feel good. Then, I saw it can do what it said and that’s why it 
is pleasing.” P08 [27] 









“If you remember, I asked you if I am gonna write ‘off’ because I don’t like 
texting and I find texting hard. The fact that there is ready replies at the bottom 
is good. I mean, you can answer easily without getting bored.” P12 [28] 
“It increases ‘pleasing’ with this and being supporting but maybe it is unlikable 
because I think it is unhelpful. You understand its boringness because it is 
repetitive and then you are saying it is more ‘neutral’. In fact, I think I 
misunderstood a thing there such as I exaggerated the capabilities of the robot 
comparing with the robot’s basic goal.” P16 [29] 



 
 
















“… The fact that it reminds itself. It asks if you want a ‘quick talk’. Because of 
this, it sometimes feels it is unpleasant…” P08 [30] 





“It feels pleasant to talk because maybe it has never scolded me. I didn’t feel 
scary. It didn’t do this by making me feel uncomfortable or it didn’t make 
anything that might make me uncomfortable or it didn’t send any GIF.” P08 [31] 





 
 
 
 

































 
 
 
 
 
 
 “I told from the beginning that I didn’t feel I wasn’t involved in the conversation 
because it was so self centered. I didn’t feel attracted because of this. How can 
I say? I felt like I had a quota of one sentence after I read its many sentences. 
The replies were already coming until I wrote the second sentence.” P07 [32] 





 “I think it does not come with the same things everyday because we don’t talk 
so often. It comes with different things each day. For example we talk so short 
or we can’t talk a lot at the moment. We can’t talk everyday. The talks are 
generally like ‘How are you?’, ‘I do these things.’, ‘How was your day?’ then I 
say it was like this for example and then it sends emojis appropriate for the 
situtaiton. We talk few words like ‘see you later, then’. That’s it. Thus, It is nat 
really attractive.” P15 [33] 













 





“It keeps you busy somehow. I think I could have used this instead of 
‘Instagram’ or ‘Onedio’ if only I would talking with it for a certain amount of 
time or it comes to you with more daily examples rather than self-help tests or 
the it brings you the events of the day or it brings you things that attracts me. 
Then it would be more attractive. It would make it more irreplaceable but I don’t 
know if it is something desirable.” P15 [34] 

 
 




























 “At first, it impressed me I said: ‘Wow! Robot!’ Then it was routine. Joking 
aside, it was like a friend. Then, it became my ‘Wobo’.” P14 [35]

“I mean, the surveys were too long on the 3rd week. I mean, I was doing the 
survey for almost 20 minutes and I didn’t want to leave it without finishing 
because I thought it should be coherent, at least. It was too long at the moment. 
On the last week I interacted with it lesser. I was predicting how to finish it 
earlier.” P02 [37] 








 
 


“The speed of texting. It was too fast. I mean why I chose ‘2’ at the first time I 
don’t really know. What I mean ‘fast’ is that it can send very long text in very 
short amount of time which doesn’t seem like realistic. It doesn’t have to be 
realistici but in a dual conversation it might be slower till the text gets longer. 
At least for the feeling of a dialog.” P05 [38] 


“I think it is positive. I mean it tells you by being without being tiring which 
make it easy to communicate.” P03 [39] 


























 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
















 “It was something different at the beginning but when I got used to it, I 
questioned its difference. Should it be more games or more attractive things? 
Being a robot and being a robot and trying to do things with interface are 
innovative but should somethings be improved?” P03 [40] 





“It could have been more effective for me if it was understanding some 
keywords and replying to these keywords rather than having answer buttons like 
who, okey, why etc. even though I know it is not an actual person in fact it is a 
robot. Generally it would be nice if there were several options and it chose one 
of these. I mean these options might exist but you still feel in need of telling 
your problems and getting replies while you get psychological support. At least, 
I think I would need that and acted like that.” P06. [41] 




 










“It takes a lot of time to give a strategy but it still is ineffective. I talk with it for 
15 minutes but I still got something that I can achieve with one click. Things 
like these weren’t worth it.” P04 [41] 







“I think it tries to give a support without being lost in details and it does it 
effectively. It means it is effective. It does its job being simple.” P16 [43] 



“Its being directive was good because I didn’t know what I need to do and how 
I can reply. Then it directed me which is good.” P05 [44] 



 

































 
 
 
 
 
 


“The talks of the last few days were monotonous and I wasn’t sure why it asked 
these questions, how they will affect and if they are useful.” P03 [45] 







“I mean sometimes it says too many things at the same time which is impractical 
and maybe… This is more like why it insists if I don’t want to talk? I mean I 
couldn’t leave conversation immediately when I wanted.” P07 [46] 



“It is practical because you open the Facebook and you can write whenever and 
whatever you would like to. It gives three options. You can chose the proper one 
when you need to be quick. You don’t have to text everything. I find the sound 
for this is bit disturbing. I don’t know how it is for visually impaired people. 
Having an option for this is great for them.” P09 [47] 






“… menu and the new features. I mean sometimes I want to use it passively 
when it writes ‘How was your day?’ like watching a movie which feels good. 
Then you don’t need to do something, you don’t need to be active so the new 
additional features of the menu…” P01 [48] 

 





























 
 
“As I said it asks the questions organizedly and I start and go. It explains what 
to talk today, what to talk about or sometimes it brings something different for 
the questions it asked several times but I mean it is organized.” P14 [49] 



“It organizes even your answers and shows them. It knows what happens next 
and give possibilities which means its mind is organized. You give something 
and it gives an option. You do something, it eliminates it and gives an option. It 
is organized because of its codes. It can’t be cluttered, it is not possible because 
it is not capable. I related it with this. I didn’t relate it with our texting mentality. 
Its mind is really organized. Sometimes it makes a loop like ‘I would say this’,’ 
I would do that’, ‘I would do this again’… It is around 1000 times more 
organized than a person.” P09 [50] 


“It often texts me at similar hours related to my talking hours with it. It’s like it 
regulates itself while we are talking like ‘he/she replies me at this hours when I 
write him/her at this hours’. I felt like it writes accordingly, in more appropriate 
times. For example notification sending frequency has changed according to my 
texting-replying frequencies. Moreover, it tracks the previous flow very good. It 
can show it again at some point so it is really organized. Anything else didn’t 
occur my mind about this.” P08 [51]

“I mean the flow can be learned easily. You can talk quickly. That’s why I found 
it easy to learn. If you ask about what it tells when you ask easiness of the talk, 
I think the language and topic were also clear.” P12 [52] 













 








“It was easy to use but if you ask why it is not ‘3’ but ‘2’. It is hard when you 
reply. I’ve been like ‘alright, I said this but what I am gonna answer its 
question?’ I said I am sorry but it asks why I am sorry for a minute. It is actually 
because of how it says it. That’s related to it, not me.” P14 [53] 





















 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 









“I mean what they want is actually pretty obvious with this survey but is the way 
of doing it really explanatory? It is not. The reason is it’s a specific talking for 
example when the dentist is going to do a root canal operation to me, it would 
be bothering if he does it directly. The correct way is that he should say what he 
is going to die before and this is also the way that makes me happy. ‘We are 
going to do this, it will take this long, it will take this many session etc.’ you 
would like to start your treatment like this.” P02 [54]

to ‘clear’ at first but it made me curious about how did they do the coding of 
this. Because of this, it made me curious about what is going to come next. It 
was also like this, it wasn’t too much clear. Then, this being not clear made me 
think it was not that surprising.” P06 [56]

“The reason is the first draft conversation. Then it can be unpredictable 
sometimes but sometimes it is not unpredictable. The conversation flow might

the previous concepts it told before. However, sometimes it talks about very

don’t know it is more like you can talk to this if you won’t or can’t talk to 
anybody else.” P15 [59] 


“I felt like it provided self-control to myself. I mean maybe not self-control… I 
mean for example, even when I laugh so hard, being asked then I thought ‘I am 
not actually very happy’ was something that make me actually thought about 
which was good. Maybe it asked me when I felt bad then I was like I am not 
actually that sad. I mean being asked is enough support; in the meantime, there 
were alas feedbacks like ‘we can’t be in the same mood forever’ or ‘we are not 
supposed to be in a certain stereotype’. You know but you can’t tell these to 
yourself. To hear that, I mean to read that feels good.” P14 [60] 



 
“I mean I lived through this thing. I was related to that. It was too different. I 
had some alcohol. It was a little bit different. I ate some food. I couldn’t get a

Then the breathing exercise felt good.” P11 [61] 
































 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



















“Problem is here. The reason I have ‘security’ concern I have started to see 
suspicious ads on Facebook like ‘do you want some psychological support?’ 
coming from USA like something they tell they accompany me in my hard days. 
I mean I was already suspicious about Facebook sharing these kind of data but 
still I got bothered a lot.” P01 [62] 







 
“I mean I was thinking it keeps the data but it won’t tell anybody. I went to 
psychologist once and he/she said they will evaluate these with other 
psychologists and I was ‘OK’ because they are professionals. I mean when I 
think about it this is like that, like a psychologist, it needs to tell to improve but 
it doesn’t know me. It doesn’t concern about me being sad, not important. I mean 
I am just concerned about somebody can see it for a moment. I text something 
and I am concerned about somebody can see it. Not only somebody can see the 
screen but also Facebook keep some data. I mean I can’t say there was Tayyip 
again in the morning and I opened it. I mean you can’t write that, I am afraid of 
this. I don’t feel free. That’s why. Not like ‘Oh God! I am so deep into insecurity. 
I can’t write.’.” P09 [63] 







“At first, the thing about if it is going to use these data… I missed the parent part 
for example. Maybe that’s why I have lack of information but maybe it is the 

 
 
trust thing. I guess it was written something like that. I mean, do I remember 
wrong? Exactly! It says they keep it without names. I mean we have a habit of 
not trusting things like these I think that’s why I said ‘not secure’. Then it 
declared something which is good, it would have not cared at all. I thought 
declaring this thing was a good thing, that’s why I am not sure. I think they can 
store the statistics without names. Then they can study on utilizing this. That can 
support this issues. I think that part does not compel the ‘secure’ part.” P06 [64] 



“I mean at first, I didn’t have any idea but when I went home I checked who did 
it, how they did it, then I thought it is secure.” P02 [65] 












“I mean I don’t have a Facebook account. That’s why we could do with you 
when I learned I don’t need to have Facebook account for it. Since I am not a 
Facebook user I didn’t feel that because I contacted with Wobeot not anybody 
else. I didn’t think it is under the Facebook. Because of the robot image of it, the 
Facebook relations didn’t come to my mind.” P06 [66]

“At first, I thought it is interesting, at least. When I used it, I thought it is bit 
stupid. Then I thought it is inferior. Being repetitive, having a certain 
conversation frame, how did it navigate when it got out of this frame, then how 





 
 
 
 
 
it brought things together, the protocols there made me think it is inferior.” P10 
[67] 







“I think the fact that the psychological support integrated with improving 
technology is certainly valuable.” P16 [68] 













“I mean I think it is really innovative. It is hard to find a psychologist next to 
you all the time. He/she would rip you off even if you find someone. That’s why 
I found it valuable. Responding quickly, being friendly, and being consistent… 
Even if it has a classical approach, it actually understood that approach. It 
internalised it very good. The things it says and it wants you to do are nice. It 
tries to make you relax. It wants you to relax while talking with it. It doesn’t 
understand the word but you still have written it. You talk to someone and 
confide. That’s why it is valuable. I realized it tries to achieve that at last. Since 

 
I didn’t expect that it might get lower a bit at the final but you still talk like 
talking to your friend. You tell somebody and it feels different and you’re not 
afraid. ‘I feel so bad and this guy made me these’ you can say and you are not 
afraid like you said them to somebody that you don’t know because he/she might 
tell the story to 3rd person. However you’re relax with this because it won’t tell. 
That’s why it is valuable about the approach. It might make people relaxed 
because of this. Sometimes psychologists change their facial impressions and it 
makes you irritated or you think if he/she judges you. However this is more like 
a cutie. It doesn’t do anything. It doesn’t judge you. You know that. It’s valuable 
because of this.” P09 [69] 


























 
 
 
 
 
 
 








“I mean technological things always attract me. I don’t know if everybody feel 
the same way but communicating with a robot is exciting. However it decreases 
while you get to the last weeks. If it continued more, I might have muted it 
because it asks every day.” P16 [70] 









“It gave a lot of examples. I mean I was already researching mindfulness in my 
thesis so I am already informed. That’s why the fact that it was so detailed… I 
mean I should be able to skip when I want. However if you write different thing 
it doesn’t change the topic. You have to read all the text. That was so boring. 
Writing too much message… I mean it can attract me if it is something that I 
don’t know but when it does this about the fields that I already know then it 
becomes boring.” P04 [71] 


“At first the information was good then it was like… I mean at first it taught 
more about mindfulness then it was like more quick talks about what can I do. 

 
It gave short information and then it shut sometimes. Then it became not so 
valuable and not so exciting.” P12 [72] 






“… I mean it is bit didactic. It is like ‘I am teaching you these now’, I mean 
about the ‘teaching stuff’ part. I didn’t find it very good because it is good 
somehow but how it does this also important. I mean I felt like it is not supposed 
to do this at the beginning. You know it would be better if we interact first and 
then ‘teach you stuff’ can start. I would find it positive, then. The reason is I 
mean in our lectures it is also like this. We checked what lecture it is first then 
we get the introduction and then start to learn. Teaching a lot of things just from 
the beginning is something that I don’t find effective.” P06 [73] 





















 



“… This quick responses which means it doesn’t read your text. I mean it just 
gives you some answer from its inventory.” P06 [74] 







“I am going to there always, I mean it is an interesting idea but not so interesting. 
Meanwhile, things like these started to get so widespread. There are a lot of 
movies, TV series etc. We see these things on ‘Black Mirror’for example. Even 
if we don’t use these things in our daily lives, possibilities of these can be in our 
lives in future doesn’t sound very interesting.” P07 [75] 




“I don’t know if you won’t talk to anybody, if you can’t, then you can talk to 
this, spend some time. For example if I wait for a person on the street which I 
hate to do, I would talk to this like if I’m texting with an actual person. I don’t 
know it can fill some emptiness. At least, I think like this which I find 
interesting.” P15 [76] 

 
 
























 “It is not an actual person, man. It’s just a robot. If I know it is a person, I would 
trust it more. I wouldn’t trust a person more but I still would. I don’t know, as I 
said, not like it should complement me, it should accompany me or something 
like that but if it motivates me when I am sad I think I need to get out of that 
environment. I should go see friends. I should be with myself. My home is far 



 
 
 
 
 
away and I am already living alone and get bored. Then also I say I am texting 
with a robot. I fall completely down when I think about it.” P13 [77] 




“I wouldn’t say you have such weak points in superhero test. This is a 
conversational agent but still it would have said these are your strong points. It 
woluldn’t say ‘you’re like these, you have these bad habits’. Then I don’t think 
it is for me but it is generally motivating. I mean I guess being goal-oriented 
makes it like that.” P15 [78] 









“When I thought different, it made me feel different or it made me feel like it is 
going to be alright. That’s why it was motivating.” P14 [79]

 “I think it is a creative idea but did it actualized the idea? I think, no. I mean it 
can’t reply, we can’t talk properly. It is then more like the self-help books. I read 
such books and they also have some techniques. I already do that I mean but the 
idea is good.” P04 [80] 























 



















“At the beginning I though it is more innovative. I said it is going to text me 
back as long as I text. I mean it texts but what I thought it was going to reply to 
me. I thought it is more like the ‘Siri’ do you understand? For example I will say 
‘I study’ and it will ask where I am studying. I mean actually Siri doesn’t also 
have this but I will say ‘in the University’ and it will ask something about the 
university. I will ask ‘where are you?’ and it will say ‘California’ and I am going 
to say ‘really? I am in Ankara’ etc. I thought it is something like this, I don’t 
know.” P13 [84] 






 
 
“When I think about it as a conversational agent, there are the ones as 
companions. The ones with only well-being can support till a certain points. It 
is close to conventional because it shares the same ground with the companion 
ones. The words it uses, approaching like a friend etc. It is like there is only one 
conversational agent making guideline and everyone uses that and orient 
different directions.” P08 [85] 



“…because the idea is different. It can be improved and it might have a potential 
as I told. The number of psychological problems is increasing and people starts 
to live longer so people don’t know the level of their problems. I mean they can 
be used to diagnose as tolerable or intolerable. It might be useful in future. That’s 
why I answered by thinking its future.” P11 [86] 



















 
 
 
 


“At first, I hoped it was leading-edge. Then it was like usual for me. As I told, I 
was expecting I text and it texts back, I was hoping that. I mean come on! You 
are on Facebook Messenger. It is not an ordinary app. If it is like this, I would 
prefer an app. I want to text on Messenger like I talk to a friend. We don’t chat. 
Then I can read a book like a self-help book.” P13 [87] 


“It is more focused on a specific topic comparing with other conversational 
agents so it is unusual. There wasn’t an AI like this which helps people in this 
area. I mean there are some in a robot level but people can’t access them. This 
is accessible and can be used by other people which makes it leading-edge.” P08

“I will tell you about the conservative part. Let me tell you again. The 
approaching of psychology was very conservative but when I look like that then 
it is not conservative because I guess I look at that way. I mean excitement 
viewpoint because I had and expectation and I thought it was gonna help so 
differently. Then I see it conservative, I see creativity part is decreasing.” P09 
[89] 




“I mean the idea of being assistant, especially on social media, in this era which 
we always hold our phones and talk to someone consistently… I mean the idea 
of being assistant when we can’t talk with anybody is innovative.” P02 [90]

The CA should be able to operate

The CA should be aware of

with the users’ responses. 
The advancement in Natural Language 
Understanding would also improve the 
“prediction” aspect of the CA. Since 
Woebot could not fully understand the 
user’s responses and intentions, the 
interpreted as 
given responses are 
superficial. After understanding 
the 
users and their response, the CA would 
predict the most appropriate answers to 
advance the interaction.

however, what they have expected from 
the Woebot was exciting and interesting. 
The CA should give feedbacks related to 
the task completion states of the users to 
show them whether the shared activities 
are understood or not by them. 
The user should be able to reach the 
shared files from a menu of the CA or it 
could share a link to make shared data

with a survey which should be filled at

users to express their emotional states.

represent are not understandable for the

Typing indicators are advantageous for

in 
Woebot case, the typing could not be

responses; 
however, with web views the CA can 
convey detailed information concerning 
the user’s preferences and interests. 
Context and memory are important 
design aspects in order to have an 
engaging user experience. Not being 
aware of the context of the user is 
interpreted as forceful interaction. Since 
Woebot does not understand the user’s 
context, forces users to continue to make 
conversation and complete or view the 
shared data; however, if the CA would 
be able to pay attention to user and 
his/her context, conversations would 
progress in mutual understanding. 
The memory is important for the CA to 
remember earlier conversations with the 
users. To give feedback to the user and 
to understand the progress accomplished 
through the conversations the memory 
plays a crucial role. It is also a beneficial 
design aspect for customized responses. 
Furthermore, the CA’s memory would 
decrease the cognitive load of the user; 
in other words, the user does not have to

data 
or 
conversations.
