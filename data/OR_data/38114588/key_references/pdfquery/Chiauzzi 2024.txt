Abstract 
Background Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) may reduce treatment access issues for those experienc‑ 
ing depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. DMHIs that incorporate relational agents may offer unique ways to engage 
and respond to users and to potentially help reduce provider burden. This study tested Woebot for Mood & Anxiety 
(W‑MA‑02), a DMHI that employs Woebot, a relational agent that incorporates elements of several evidence‑based 
psychotherapies, among those with baseline clinical levels of depressive or anxiety symptoms. Changes in self‑ 
reported depressive and anxiety symptoms over 8 weeks were measured, along with the association between each 
of these outcomes and demographic and clinical characteristics. 
Methods This exploratory, single‑arm, 8‑week study of 256 adults yielded non‑mutually exclusive subsamples 
with either clinical levels of depressive or anxiety symptoms at baseline. Week 8 Patient Health Questionnaire‑8 (PHQ‑ 
8) changes were measured in the depressive subsample (PHQ‑8 ≥ 10). Week 8 Generalized Anxiety Disorder‑7 (GAD‑7) 
changes were measured in the anxiety subsample (GAD‑7 ≥ 10). Demographic and clinical characteristics were exam‑ 
ined in association with symptom changes via bivariate and multiple regression models adjusted for W‑MA‑02 utiliza‑ 
tion. Characteristics included age, sex at birth, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, sexual orientation, employ‑ 
ment status, health insurance, baseline levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and concurrent psychotherapeutic 
or psychotropic medication treatments during the study. 
Results Both the depressive and anxiety subsamples were predominantly female, educated, non‑Hispanic white, 
and averaged 38 and 37 years of age, respectively. The depressive subsample had significant reductions in depres‑ 
sive symptoms at Week 8 (mean change =—7.28, SD = 5.91, Cohen’s d = ‑1.23, p < 0.01); the anxiety subsample had 
significant reductions in anxiety symptoms at Week 8 (mean change = ‑7.45, SD = 5.99, Cohen’s d = ‑1.24, p < 0.01). No 
significant associations were found between sex at birth, age, employment status, educational background and Week 
8 symptom changes. Significant associations between depressive and anxiety symptom outcomes and sexual orien‑ 
tation, marital status, concurrent mental health treatment, and baseline symptom severity were found. 


Background 
Mental health issues have consistently contributed 
to the worldwide disease burden [1]. This held true 
before but was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pan- 
demic, given its associated increase of 25% in depres- 
sive and anxiety disorders [2]. Stressing already limited 
mental health treatment access and provider capacity, 
the increased prevalence has left even more individu- 
als without needed care [3, 4]. In order to mitigate such 
prolific access and capacity issues, people experiencing 
symptoms of depression and anxiety may seek interven- 
tions with alternative delivery modalities [5]. Indeed, 
the heightened need for treatment access has led to an 
increase in the use and study of technology-delivered 
mental health interventions [6]. Such interventions, 
known as digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), 
offer self-guided (no human support), guided (human 
support specific to the DMHI offered via telephone, 
video, or text), or blended (a combination of DMHI plus 
human support) approaches to deliver treatment mod- 
ules and skill-building interventions [7]. DMHIs have 
included therapeutic techniques from one or more evi- 
dence-based psychotherapies, such as cognitive behav- 
ioral therapy (CBT) [7]. In aggregate, DMHIs have been 
shown to produce at least moderate improvements in 
depressive and anxiety symptoms [8–10]. 
Among DMHIs, there has been increased attention on 
and proliferation of mental health chatbots [11, 12] also 
known as conversational agents [13, 14]. Conversational 
agent-delivered interventions are often available on a 
smartphone application (app), enabling users access at 
any time for support and to address immediate prob- 
lems contextually in real time. Like the broader DMHI 
category, conversational agent-delivered interventions 
may be founded in evidence-based psychotherapeu- 
tic approaches such as CBT, Acceptance and Commit- 
ment Therapy (ACT), and Dialectical Behavior Therapy 
(DBT) [7, 15–17]. In addition to thoughtful conversa- 
tional design, some conversational agents are bolstered 
by artificial intelligence and/or natural language pro- 
cessing (NLP) [18], which may enable response by deliv- 
ery of therapeutic intervention and psychoeducational 
content. Conversational agent-delivered interventions 
may be particularly useful for those who wish to receive 
help without speaking to a clinician due to stigma or 
cost concerns [13]. Recent meta-analyses of conver- 
sational agent delivered DMHIs indicate that they are 
generally viewed favorably by users and may enhance 
access to mental health care and improve mental health 
outcomes [11, 13, 19]. 
When conversational agents are built to form an alli- 
ance with users over time, they may be referred to as 
relational agents [20, 21]. Some data have demonstrated 
that relational agents are able to form a working thera- 
peutic alliance with users [22], which has been linked to 
improved mental health outcomes [23]. These capabili- 
ties, coupled with their immediate availability in some- 
one’s moment of need, offer the potential for relational 
agents to extend the current menu of mental health ser- 
vices available to those in need. Unfortunately, little is 
known about the characteristics of users who may benefit 
from relational agent-delivered DMHI [11]. 
The broader, non-relational agent-specific DMHI lit- 
erature provides some clues about what types of user 
demographic or clinical characteristics might be asso- 
ciated with outcomes among relational agent users, but 
much of the evidence has been inconclusive. DMHI stud- 
ies of depression and anxiety have reported inconsistent 
findings in outcomes by characteristics such as gender, 
age, marital status, or education [24–29]. Although there 
is preliminary evidence of the feasibility and acceptabil- 
ity of DMHI interventions for racial/ethnic, LGBTQ (les- 
bian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning), 
and other marginalized or underserved groups, these 
demographic and self-identity characteristics have been 
underexplored as predictors of outcomes in the DMHI 
literature [30, 31]. Individual DMHI studies address- 
ing racial and ethnic minorities have shown promise in 
reducing depressive symptoms, but large scale prospec- 
tive studies are lacking [31]. 
With regard to clinical characteristics, non-relational 
agent-specific DMHI studies have generally found that 
users with higher severity levels of anxiety and depression 
tend to achieve greater improvement in these symptoms 
than those with lesser severity [8, 10, 32], likely an arti- 
fact that these users have more room for improvement 
Conclusions The present study suggests early promise for W‑MA‑02 as an intervention for depression and/or anxi‑ 
ety symptoms. Although exploratory in nature, this study revealed potential user characteristics associated with out‑ 
comes that can be investigated in future studies. 
Trial Registration This study was retrospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT05672745) on January 5th, 
2023.

[8]. Surprisingly, the association between concurrent 
mental health treatment (i.e., psychotherapy and/or psy- 
chotropic medications) and DMHI-related changes in 
depression and anxiety symptoms has seen little inves- 
tigation. One study of health care workers during the 
COVID-19 pandemic found that exposure to a mobile 
phone–based mental health intervention did not signifi- 
cantly affect Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS- 
21) scores in the overall sample, but a subgroup analysis 
of those receiving psychotherapy or psychotropic medi- 
cations found significant improvements in this group 
[33]. While some data exist on demographic and clinical 
characteristic associations with mental health outcomes 
among the broad category of DMHIs, the authors could 
find no such data in the literature specific to relational 
or conversational agent-delivered DMHIs. Thus, further 
exploration of putative demographic and clinical char- 
acteristics among users of a relational agent-delivered 
DMHI is needed to illuminate optimal uses as well as 
perhaps tailor interventions to the unique needs of indi- 
viduals experiencing anxiety and depressive symptoms. 
This present study evaluated Woebot for Mood and 
Anxiety (W-MA-02), an intervention delivered via Woe- 
bot, a relational agent that utilizes thoughtful conversa- 
tional design and some NLP to incorporate elements 
of CBT, Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), and DBT 
into a text-based interface on a smartphone app. Fea- 
sibility, acceptability, and efficacy studies using Woe- 
bot-based interventions have shown promise in young 
adults reporting depressive symptoms [34], adults with 
substance abuse issues [35], adolescents with depres- 
sive and/or anxiety symptoms [36], and adult women 
with postpartum mood concerns [37, 38]. The present 
study sought to address gaps in the literature specific to 
a relational agent-delivered DMHI by first measuring 
depressive or anxiety symptom changes after 8 weeks 
of W-MA-02 use among participants with self-reported 
clinical levels of depressive or anxiety symptoms at base- 
line, respectively. In addition, the study explored asso- 
ciations between participant demographic and clinical 
characteristics and depressive and anxiety symptom out- 
comes. The research questions in this exploratory study 
included the following: 
1. Do participants with clinically elevated depressive 
symptoms at baseline have significant decreases in 
symptoms at Week 8 of a relational agent-delivered 
DMHI? 
2. Do participants with clinically elevated anxiety 
symptoms at baseline have significant decreases in 
symptoms at Week 8 of a relational agent-delivered 
DMHI? 
3. Does the amount of depressive and anxiety symptom 
reduction at Week 8 of a relational agent-delivered 
DMHI differ by demographic characteristics, clinical 
characteristics (i.e., baseline anxiety and depression 
symptom severity), and involvement in concurrent 
mental health treatment? 
Methods 
Overall study description 
This exploratory study was non-randomized, single- 
armed, and open-labeled. Study procedures were approved 
by the WIRB-Copernicus IRB Group (WCG) institutional 
review board on January 20th, 2022. All participants pro- 
vided informed consent. Data was collected from W-MA- 
02 participants between May 11th, 2022 and July 20th, 
2022. The study was retrospectively registered on Clinical- 
Trials.gov (#NCT05672745) on January 5th, 2023. 

A convenience sample was recruited via social media 
advertisements, such as Facebook and Instagram, con- 
taining an embedded hyperlink to the study’s electronic 
consent form. Upon signing the consent form, study staff 
emailed participants a link to complete the self-report 
screening (assessing inclusion and exclusion criteria) and 
baseline survey questions. The inclusion criteria were: (1) 
18 years of age or older, (2) residence in the United States 
(U.S.), (3) reported English literacy, (4) availability to com- 
plete study activities, and (5) ownership or regular access 
to a smartphone with WiFi and sufficient data access for 
the duration of the study. The exclusion criteria were: (1) 
current suicidal ideation with a plan or intent to act or a 
suicide attempt within the past 12 months, (2) a reported 
lifetime diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (including schiz- 
ophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) or bipolar disorder, 
or (3) previous use of a Woebot application. 
Participants who met inclusion and exclusion crite- 
ria and who completed the baseline survey assessments 
within 7 days of receipt were immediately provided 
with a link to access and download W-MA-02. They 
were instructed to complete registration within 3 days 
using the study’s referral code and the same credentials 
entered at consent. Those who failed to register within 
3 days became ineligible for the study and thus were not 
enrolled. Participants who did not meet eligibility criteria 
were thanked for their interest, given a list of national cri- 
sis resources, and exited from the study. 

Enrolled participants entered the 8-week intervention 
period, where they were invited to engage with W-MA- 
02 daily. Participants completed survey assessments 
 



that were delivered outside of the application via email 
invitation at Day 3, Week 4 (mid-intervention), and 
Week 8 (end of intervention; EOI). Upon the comple- 
tion of the final survey, participants exited the study 
and their access to W-MA-02 was discontinued. Par- 
ticipants received a maximum of $100 in Amazon gift 
cards for completing study assessments ($20, $30, and 
$50 for Day 3, Week 4, and Week 8, respectively; pay- 
ments were not linked to app usage). This study reports 
data collected at baseline and Week 8 (EOI). Figure 1 
describes the participant flow through the study. 

W-MA-02 is intended for users seeking help with mood 
management and tracking; it is not mental health dis- 
order-specific. The application is accessible as an iOS 
or Android smartphone application and hosts the rela- 
tional agent Woebot to guide users through psycho- 
therapeutic content delivered via text-based messages. 
Using proprietary natural language processing, the user 
experience centers around goal-oriented conversations 
based on self-reported real-time needs. These conver- 
sations are tailored to help the user develop emotion 


regulation skills in the context of problems experienced 
in their everyday lives. W-MA-02 is grounded in scien- 
tifically validated psychotherapies (e.g., CBT, IPT, DBT) 
and helps users address mood monitoring and manage- 
ment, as well as utilizes tools such as progress reflection, 
gratitude journaling, and mindfulness practice. Previous 
studies of various Woebot applications, including the 
W-MA-02 intervention, have provided evidence of fea- 
sibility, acceptability and efficacy [34, 35, 38, 39], as well 
as demonstrated its ability to form a working alliance 
with users [22]. Sample screenshots from W-MA-02 are 
shown in Fig. 2. 

W-MA-02 is not a crisis service. However, it is 
equipped with an NLP algorithm that detects pat- 
terns in user free-text input that may suggest potential 
concerning language. Upon detection, W-MA-02 asks 
the user to confirm if they are in crisis. For all confir- 
mations, W-MA-02 provides a list of resources that 
includes emergency contact phone numbers and sui- 
cide crisis hotline information. W-MA-02 then offers 
tools to assist with addressing upsetting emotions and 
thoughts in the moment. The list of resources is also 
immediately available at any time to the user either 
from the settings menu or by entering “SOS” in free 
text. Potential concerning language detection triggers 
and confirmations were not actively monitored by staff 
during the study. 
Due to the low-risk profile of this study, adverse 
events (AEs) were assessed by spontaneous participant 
reports communicated outside of W-MA-02 and fol- 
lowed a predetermined safety protocol. In the event of a 
spontaneously reported AE to any study staff, the Prin- 
cipal Investigator would be immediately alerted with all 
available clinical and other details of the event. Based 
on this initial report, appropriate steps would be taken 
to gather further information as needed and address 
the AE. During this study, no such AEs were reported. 

Participants were emailed links to survey assessments 
through the Castor Electronic Data Capture (EDC) [40] 
platform, with a 7-day window to complete the baseline 
and Week 8 surveys reported herein. Completion of 
the baseline survey was considered Day 1 of the inter- 
vention period. We tracked the assessment comple- 
tion rate, defined as completion of both the PHQ-8 and 
GAD-7 at baseline and Week 8. 

 



The baseline survey assessed demographic charac- 
teristics, including age, race/ethnicity, marital status, 
education, sexual orientation, employment status, and 
health insurance. Gender identity, while collected, did 
not yield enough individuals who identified outside of 
the most common categories (Man or Woman) to allow 
for inclusion in the models. Instead, we included sex 
assigned at birth. 
Clinical characteristics 
Concurrent mental health treatment 
Concurrent treatment was defined as mental health 
treatment at any point in the study. At baseline, partici- 
pants were asked to indicate if they were currently see- 
ing a therapist for mental health concerns and/or if they 
were taking medications for a psychiatric condition. At 
the Week 8 assessment, participants were asked if psy- 
chotropic medications and/or psychotherapy were con- 
tinued or if either was started during the course of the 
8-week study intervention. 

The PHQ-8 is a widely used 8-item self-report measure, 
with demonstrated reliability and sensitivity to clini- 
cal change. It is used to screen for depression, measure 
symptom severity, and assess outcome [41]. Respond- 
ents are asked to consider symptoms over the past two 
weeks and to indicate frequency of symptoms from not 
at all (0) to nearly every day (3). The total sum scores 
range from 0–24, with the following severity cutoffs— 
minimal (0–4), mild (5–9), moderate (10–14), moder- 
ately severe (15–19), and severe (20–24). A score of 10 
or greater is considered an acceptable clinical cutoff for 
current depression [41]. PHQ-8 scores at baseline and 
Week 8 were analyzed in this study. 

The GAD-7 is a brief self-report tool to assess the fre- 
quency and severity of anxious thoughts and behav- 
iors [42]. Respondents are asked to indicate frequency 
of symptoms from not at all (0) to nearly every day (3) 
over the previous two weeks. Total sum scores range 
from 0–21, with the following severity cutoffs—minimal 
(0–4), mild (5–9), moderate (10–14), and severe (15– 
21). A score of 10 or greater is considered a reasonable 
clinical cutoff for generalized anxiety disorder [42]. 

Over the course of the study, we tracked participant 
W-MA-02 log-ins. Completion of the. 
intervention was defined as logging in to W-MA-02 
during at least 50% (i.e., at least 4 of 8) of the study weeks 
(yes vs. no). 

Each set of analyses was performed on the two analytic 
subsamples: study participants with PHQ-8 ≥ 10 at base- 
line and those with GAD-7 ≥ 10 at baseline. Participants 
with clinically elevated symptoms of both depressive 
and anxiety symptoms were included in both subsam- 
ples (although multiple regression models adjusted for 
the presence of the other symptoms in analyses). Con- 
tinuous demographic and clinical variables were sum- 
marized by means and standard deviations; discrete and/ 
or ordinal variables were summarized by reporting the 
sample size and proportion of participants in each cat- 
egory. Response was defined as having a 50% reduction 
in PHQ-8 measured depressive symptoms among those 
with PHQ-8 ≥ 10 at baseline and having a 50% reduction 
in GAD-7 measured anxiety symptoms among those with 
GAD-7 ≥ 10 at baseline. 
To address the first research question, a paired t-test 
was applied to the baseline and Week 8 PHQ-8 scores for 
the subgroup defined as having a baseline PHQ-8 ≥ 10. 
Similarly, for those with elevated anxiety symptoms at 
baseline (GAD-7 ≥ 10), a paired t-test was applied to the 
baseline and Week 8 GAD-7 scores to address the sec- 
ond research question. For both instances, the tests were 
intent-to-treat and two-sided, with alpha = 0.05. 
To assess the third research question, sets of bivari- 
ate and multiple linear regression models were sepa- 
rately fit to the subgroups with baseline PHQ-8 ≥ 10 and 
baseline GAD-7 ≥ 10. Each regression model included 
change in depressive or anxiety symptom scores as out- 
comes, respectively, and each demographic and clinical 
characteristic as independent variables. First, bivariate 
regressions were run between each outcome and each 
demographic and clinical characteristic, separately. Then, 
a multiple regression model that included all demographic 
and clinical characteristics as well as an indicator of uti- 
lization to adjust for W-MA-02 use (dichotomous vari- 
able of having any W-MA-02 use in at least 50%, or 4 of 
8, weeks of the study) were run and, using Akakie’s Infor- 
mation Criterion (AIC) for model selection, rerun until 
the final model was attained. Final models also removed 
all variables with Variance Inflation Factors greater than 
4 to account for multicollinearity. Each model was run on 
the ITT population with no accommodations for miss- 
ing data (i.e., those with missing data were dropped from 
individual bivariate or multiple regression models in each 
instance). Sensitivity analyses were performed with the PP 
population, which included participants who used the app 
in at least 4 of 8 study weeks and who completed the end 


of study (EOS) PHQ-8 and GAD-7 assessments; the same 
modeling approach used for the intention to treat (ITT) 
population was applied to the PP population. The level of 
significance for all final models was 0.05. All analyses were 
performed with the R statistical software program [43]. 
Results 
Sample 
As detailed in the CONSORT diagram (Fig. 3), 1105 poten- 
tial participants were screened. Of these, 485 were excluded 
for not meeting eligibility criteria. After screening and 
baseline assessments were conducted, an additional 358 
participants with unauthorized accounts (e.g., duplicate 
registrants) were withdrawn from the study and excluded 
from the analyses. Of the original 262 enrollees, an addi- 
tional six unauthorized registrants began to complete study 
procedures but were subsequently removed from the ana- 
lytic sample because they were initially missed as a result of 
a clerical error. Thus, the final analytic sample consisted of 
256 participants. Of these 256 participants, 245 completed 
the Day 3 survey, 236 completed the Week 4 surveys, and 
234 completed the Week 8 surveys. 
Fig. 3 CONSORT diagram. Although Day 3 and Week 4 survey data were collected as part of the parent study, they were not part of the analyses 
included in the present report. Six participants were removed after enrollment due to a clerical error; they should have been removed prior 
to enrollment 
 



The analytic subsamples included 111 participants with 
elevated baseline levels of depressive symptoms and 
107 participants with elevated baseline levels of anxiety 
symptoms at baseline as defined by a PHQ-8 score ≥ 10 
and/or GAD-7 score ≥ 10, respectively. The sample size 
for the combined (elevated on PHQ-8 or GAD-7) groups 
comprised 139 participants; some participants with ele- 
vated symptoms of both depressive and anxiety symp- 
toms were in both analytic subsamples (n = 79). Both the 
depressive symptom and anxiety symptom samples were 
predominantly female, educated, and employed, identi- 
fied as non-Hispanic white and heterosexual, and had 
private health insurance (Table 1) with mean ages of 38 
and 37 years, respectively. Among those with clinical lev- 
els of depressive symptoms, 50% had symptoms falling in 
the moderately severe or severe range (PHQ-8 score ≥ 15) 
and 49% reported concurrent mental health treatment 
during the study. Among those with clinical levels of anx- 
iety symptoms, 44% had symptoms falling in the severe 
range (GAD-7 score ≥ 15) and 53% reported concurrent 
mental health treatment during the study. 

The assessment completion rate at Week 8 was 91%. The 
PP population examined in sensitivity analyses com- 
prised 177 (69%) of the 256 participants in the analytic 
sample after removing 67 (26%) who used W-MA-02 for 
at most 3 of 8 weeks and removing 22 (9%) whose EOS 
PHQ-8 and GAD-7 assessments at Week 8 were fully 
missing (no item scores were completed for each meas- 
ure); the removals were not mutually exclusive (n = 10 
met both criteria). Sixty-four percent (N = 71/111) of the 
elevated depressive symptoms subgroup met PP and 59% 
(N = 63/107) of the elevated anxiety symptoms subgroup 
met these criteria. 
to the intervention. In bivariate regression models, the 
amount of symptom decline did not significantly differ 
by age, educational level, employment, or baseline level 
of anxiety symptoms but did significantly differ across 
several characteristics tested (Table 2). Non-Hispanic 
Blacks, those who were single, and those with severe 
levels of baseline depressive symptoms demonstrated 
significantly greater amounts of decline in depressive 
symptoms than Non-Hispanic Whites, those who were 
married/partnered/cohabiting, and those with moder- 
ate levels of baseline depressive symptoms, respectively. 
Females, participants identifying as sexual minorities, 
those with private or government-based health insurance, 
those who used the program on at least 4 of the 8 weeks, 
and those in concurrent mental health treatment demon- 
strated significantly lower amounts of decline in depres- 
sive symptoms than males, participants identifying as 
heterosexuals, those with no health insurance or who 
declined to answer the health insurance question, those 
who used the program on less than 4 of the 8 weeks, and 
those not in concurrent mental health treatment, respec- 
tively. After removing race/ethnicity, insurance, and 
employment from consideration because of multicolline- 
arity, the final multiple regression model indicated signif- 
icant differences in the amount of decrease in depressive 
symptoms at Week 8 by sexual orientation, marital sta- 
tus, baseline depressive symptom severity category, and 
concurrent mental health treatment (Table 3) in the same 
directions as each bivariate model described above (in 
addition, divorced individuals had greater amounts of 
depressive symptom declines as compared with married/ 
partnered, cohabiting). Although a few bivariate analy- 
ses had varying levels of significance across ITT and PP 
analyses (Supplemental Table 1), the multiple regression 
model largely confirmed the full sample findings (Supple- 
mental Table 2). 


No study participant reported an AE or serious adverse 
event (SAE) during the study. Over the course of the 
study, 127,773 messages were sent by the 256 partici- 
pants. A subset of 71 participants provided text inputs 
containing language suggestive of a potential crisis. Of 
these participants, four confirmed being in a crisis situa- 
tion and were automatically provided resources and sup- 
port as described in the Ethical Considerations section of 
the Methods.

Discussion 
In this single-arm exploratory trial of W-MA-02, an 
intervention employing an NLP-supported relational 
agent, the objective was to explore the magnitude of the 
reduction in self-reported depressive (PHQ-8) and anx- 
iety (GAD-7) symptoms between baseline and Week 
8 EOI as well as the associative relationships between 
demographic and clinical characteristics and each out- 
come, among those that had elevated scores on these 
measures at baseline. On average, study participants 
with elevated depressive symptoms at baseline experi- 
enced significant declines in self-reported depressive 
symptoms across the intervention period; study par- 
ticipants with elevated anxiety symptoms at baseline 
experienced significant declines in self-reported anxi- 
ety symptoms across the intervention period. In addi- 
tion, analyses revealed significant associations between 
depressive and anxiety symptom changes and demo- 
graphic and clinical characteristics in both bivariate 
and, in many cases, multiple regression models. The 
high assessment completion and W-MA-02 utilization 
rates are notable given that attrition remains a peren- 
nial problem in mobile health app studies [44], with 
one recent systematic review of depression DMHI app 
RCTs suggesting that dropout rates may range from 
26 to 48%, even when participant reimbursement was 
included in the analysis [45]. 
In the absence of a control group, it is difficult to draw 
conclusions about the efficacy of W-MA-02, especially 
given evidence that approximately one-third of untreated 
major depression or generalized anxiety disorder cases 
may spontaneously remit within 6 months [46–48]. 
However, in both the clinically elevated depressive and 
anxiety groups, we noted significant decreases in self- 
reported symptoms at Week 8. The mean level of change 
was greater than seven points on both change in PHQ-8 
among those with clinically elevated depressive symp- 
toms at baseline as well as change in GAD-7 among those 
with clinically elevated anxiety symptoms at baseline. 
This is noteworthy given that these outcomes were two 
and three points greater, respectively, than the typically 
accepted change score cutoff of five and four points to 
 


define a clinically significant response on the PHQ-8 and 
GAD-7 measures, respectively [49, 50]. 
Our adjusted analyses did not find significant associa- 
tions between sex at birth, age, educational background, 
employment, and clinical outcomes, which is consistent 
with prior psychotherapeutic and DMHI meta-analy- 
ses and systematic reviews [8, 51–53]. However, several 
studies of internet-based CBT (iCBT) have found bet- 
ter depression outcomes for females [26, 54] and greater 
probability of non-response in anxiety disorders and 
depression for males [55]. Our results may support the 
finding that age and sex at birth may be more important 
to the epidemiology of depression than to prognosis with 
an intervention [53]. 
The associations that were found in adjusted analyses 
between significant improvements in depression and 
anxiety symptoms and sexual orientation, concurrent 
mental health treatment, marital status, and baseline 
symptom severity suggest that these may be demographic 
predictors of intervention response to DMHIs employing 
relational agents. However, a series of purpose-designed 
follow-up studies to test each of these putative predictors 
of clinical outcome in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) 
design is needed before any definitive conclusions can be 
made. Given that LGBTQ individuals have demonstrated 
higher rates of depression and anxiety [56] that are fur- 
ther compounded by access barriers and stigma [31], 
DMHIs may present an unique opportunity to provide 
safe and accessible support to this group. LGBTQ indi- 
viduals are also more likely to seek health information 
with digital resources than their non-LGBTQ counter- 
parts [57] and a high proportion of people accessing digi- 
tal text-based support services identify as belonging to 
sexual and gender minorities [58]. Thus, further studies 
among this group should be a research priority. Finally, 
our study noted significant differences in the association 
of concurrent care involvement with changes in anxi- 
ety and depression symptoms, but this concurrent care 
was received independently and therefore no details on 
its characteristics (e.g., description of intervention, fre- 
quency, fidelity to psychotherapeutic treatment model, 
modality of delivery, dose, and route of psychopharmaco- 
logical agents) were available. Future studies should test 
if this association holds in a study using a prospective, 
RCT design as well as in a true blended care model that 
tightly integrates the relational-agent-delivered DMHI 
with human support. 

link 
between marital status and psychotherapy outcomes 
have been decidedly mixed [59], but in this study we 
found that single or divorced/separated/widowed indi- 
viduals in the elevated depression group and single 
individuals in the elevated anxiety group experienced 

more improved outcomes compared to their married/ 
partnered/cohabiting peers in adjusted analyses. These 
results are somewhat consistent with a study of an 
online cognitive behavior intervention compared to a 
waiting list control that demonstrated greater improve- 
ments in depression outcomes at 4 months among sep- 
arated, widowed, or divorced individuals as compared 
to married participants [60]. Due to the importance of 
social support in mental health treatment [51], a more 
detailed assessment of factors such as relationship 
quality may better explain the relationship between 
marital status and clinical outcomes [51]. 
Finally, we found that greater baseline depression and 
anxiety symptom severity was associated with greater 
symptom improvements in the elevated depression and 
anxiety groups, respectively. It is notable that 50% of the 
elevated depression group reported either moderately 
severe or severe levels of baseline symptoms and 44% of 
the elevated anxiety groups reported severe symptoms. 
DMHIs have often been considered as interventions for 
mild to moderate symptoms [61], but these findings may 
suggest promise for populations with a broader range of 
severity. While it is true that those with elevated symp- 
toms have more room to improve [8], we nonetheless 
believe that this finding suggests that there may be clini- 
cal utility for programs like this beyond mild to moderate 
severity levels with adequate safety checks in place. 

The present study adds to the extant mental health out- 
comes literature by extending the investigation of impor- 
tant demographic and clinical characteristics in DMHI 
interventions to one delivered specifically via a relational 
agent. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has 
been expressly designed for this purpose. The recruit- 
ment of a demographically diverse naturalistic sample 
allowed a broad assessment of characteristics that have 
been traditionally underexplored in digital health stud- 
ies, such as racial/ethnic membership, sexual orientation, 
employment status, and health insurance status. There 
has been increasing attention to the lack of diversity in 
marginalized and underserved participants 
involved 
in DMHI studies [31], and this study notably recruited 
much higher proportions of sexual minorities [62] and 
non-Hispanic Black [63] individuals than are found in 
the U.S. population. Despite a generally demographically 
diverse sample, it should be noted that this sample was 
about 75% female sex at birth, a proportion that is not 
unusual for health behavior studies [64]. Greater recruit- 
ment based on gender identity and participation of males 
would improve sample diversity in future studies to allow 
for greater generalization of findings. 


Several limitations must be noted. First, the study was 
not an RCT and did not include a control group, so there 
may have been additional confounders or other factors 
affecting the efficacy of the intervention. For example, 
researchers have identified user expectancies related to 
digital device use (a.k.a.“digital placebo effect”) that may 
affect mental health outcomes [65]. Subgroup differ- 
ences, some of which had small sample sizes so limited 
power to detect such differences, observed in the pre- 
sent study are preliminary and should ideally be tested 
in RCTs with larger sample sizes and a priori power cal- 
culations. Second, because the intervention was delivered 
over an 8-week period, the longer-term durability of any 
effects is not known. Changes that did occur might be 
explained by measurement reactivity, as small effects have 
been observed in health behavior change [66] and digital 
health studies [67]. Symptom improvements may also be 
explained in part by spontaneous remission [46, 47, 68] or 
other participant characteristics that were not assessed as 
part of the study. Third, symptoms and concurrent treat- 
ments were assessed via self-report and there was no inde- 
pendent confirmation of participants’ clinical presentation 
or therapeutic involvements. Although about half of the 
sample reported receiving concurrent treatment (consist- 
ent with national findings that only about half of those in 
need receive mental health care [69]), we do not know the 
nature, duration, or intensity of psychotherapies or psy- 
chotropic medications received or if participants engaged 
in other interventions (i.e., not delivered by a therapist or 
receipt of medication) In addition, although we collected 
information about both psychotherapy and psychotropic 
medications separately, the sample size was not sufficient 
to make comparisons between these modalities and so 
they were pooled for analysis. Future studies would ide- 
ally collect detailed information about the psychotherapies 
being received, as well as full details about concurrent psy- 
chotropic medications. Fourth, studies of online interven- 
tions can be affected by certain types of data quality issues 
(e.g. fraudulent participants, distraction, inattention, or 
intoxication during use) that may benefit from inclusion of 
quality checks in future experimental design [70, 71]. Fifth, 
although demographically diverse for a naturalistic sample, 
the study population was nonetheless majority college or 
advanced degree holders and employed. Additional stud- 
ies targeting the mental health needs of those with lower 
levels of educational attainment and/or who may be facing 
under- or unemployment are needed. Finally, our defini- 
tion of “per protocol” as using W-MA-02 in at least 4 of 
8 study weeks and completing EOS depressive and anxi- 
ety symptom assessments may not have been granular 
enough to account fully for achieved outcomes or to reveal 
unique patterns of disengagement. Exploring alternative 
engagement metrics would enhance our understanding of 
relational agent usage and the relationship of outcomes to 
user characteristics. 
Conclusions 
The present study suggests early promise for a DMHI 
that employs an easily scalable NLP-based relational 
agent incorporating elements of CBT, DBT, and IPT to a 
demographically diverse naturalistic sample experienc- 
ing self-reported symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. 
Although exploratory in nature, this study reveals intrigu- 
ing areas for further research that can help optimize the 
unique role DMHIs that include relational agents can 
play in filling a mental health service gap that has only 
widened in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
