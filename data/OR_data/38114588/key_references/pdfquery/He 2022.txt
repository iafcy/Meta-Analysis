Background: Depression has a high prevalence among young adults, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, 
mental health services remain scarce and underutilized worldwide. Mental health chatbots are a novel digital technology to provide 
fully automated interventions for depressive symptoms. 
Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the clinical effectiveness and nonclinical performance of a cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT)–based mental health chatbot (XiaoE) for young adults with depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Methods: In a single-blind, 3-arm randomized controlled trial, participants manifesting depressive symptoms recruited from a 
Chinese university were randomly assigned to a mental health chatbot (XiaoE; n=49), an e-book (n=49), or a general chatbot 
(Xiaoai; n=50) group in a ratio of 1:1:1. Participants received a 1-week intervention. The primary outcome was the reduction of 
depressive symptoms according to the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at 1 week later (T1) and 1 month later (T2). 
Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted under analysis of covariance models adjusting for baseline data. 
Controlled multiple imputation and δ-based sensitivity analysis were performed for missing data. The secondary outcomes were 
the level of working alliance measured using the Working Alliance Questionnaire (WAQ), usability measured using the Usability 
Metric for User Experience-LITE (UMUX-LITE), and acceptability measured using the Acceptability Scale (AS). 
Results: Participants were on average 18.78 years old, and 37.2% (55/148) were female. The mean baseline PHQ-9 score was 
10.02 (SD 3.18; range 2-19). Intention-to-treat analysis revealed lower PHQ-9 scores among participants in the XiaoE group 
compared with participants in the e-book group and Xiaoai group at both T1 (F2,136=17.011; P<.001; d=0.51) and T2 (F2,136=5.477; 
P=.005; d=0.31). Better working alliance (WAQ; F2,145=3.407; P=.04) and acceptability (AS; F2,145=4.322; P=.02) were discovered 
with XiaoE, while no significant difference among arms was found for usability (UMUX-LITE; F2,145=0.968; P=.38). 
Conclusions: A CBT-based chatbot is a feasible and engaging digital therapeutic approach that allows easy accessibility and 
self-guided mental health assistance for young adults with depressive symptoms. A systematic evaluation of nonclinical metrics 
for a mental health chatbot has been established in this study. In the future, focus on both clinical outcomes and nonclinical 
metrics is necessary to explore the mechanism by which mental health chatbots work on patients. Further evidence is required 
to confirm the long-term effectiveness of the mental health chatbot via trails replicated with a longer dose, as well as exploration 
of its stronger efficacy in comparison with other active controls.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on people’s 
mental health, increasing the rates of depression and anxiety by 
more than 25% globally in the first year, with people aged 20-24 
years being more affected than older people [1]. However, there 
are still many 
face-to-face 
psychotherapy and mental health services, including expensive 
treatment, geographical limitations, few experienced therapists, 
and delayed treatment [2], and stigma is considered as the most 
significant barrier to providing mental health services [3,4]. 
Limited accessibility and acceptability were more obvious with 
the rising risk of mental health problems [5,6] led by quarantine 
and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic [7], 
especially among adolescents [8]. Mobile health and digital 
medicine have rapidly become an important area of study [9] 
in response to the conundrum posed by the escalating demand 
for mental health assistance [10] and the severe shortage of 
traditional health care facilities [11]. 
Driven by digital technologies, such as computers, the internet, 
mobile devices, mobile software apps, and virtual reality (VR), 
treatment for mental health problems has undergone an 
unprecedented transformation [12]. 
A chatbot, as a novel digital technology for mental health 
service, is a software program that simulates conversations with 
users through text or voice depending on artificial intelligence 
(AI) [13]. The first chatbot, ELIZA, was applied in the field of 
psychology, and users could input text to simulate a conversation 
with a Rogerian psychotherapist [14]. A mental health chatbot 
provides more accessibility than traditional face-to-face 
counseling and psychotherapy [15,16], through which users can 
feel accompanied and understood [17,18]. In addition, chatbots 
were designed to focus on interactive capabilities instead of 
single psychological education for facilitating the process of 
psychotherapy [19]. Most mental health chatbots can 
independently provide service to users, without requiring the 
participation and guidance of human therapists [20]. However, 
studies have shown that mental health chatbots have some risks 
as well, such as “misunderstanding,” which may lead to 
ineffective or even harmful interventions, lack of crisis warning 
mechanisms, and lack of privacy protection [21]. Chatbots in 
mental health are nascent [22], and although chatbots have 
demonstrated feasibility to provide mental health treatment, 
more high-quality evidence regarding the effectiveness and 
acceptability of mental health chatbots is needed [23], 
particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic [24]. 
According to the latest data of the World Health Organization, 
there were 3.22 million depressed people worldwide in 2015 
[25]. In China, the figure has been reported to be 95 million 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
[26], and the prevalence among college students was 28.4% 
[27], reaching 34% during the COVID-19 pandemic [28]. 
However, the use of health services for depressive disorders in 
China has been rather limited, with the access rate of adequate 
treatment being less than 0.5% [29]. Cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) has been continuously developed and is currently 
recognized as a widespread and effective evidence-based 
psychotherapy for depression [30,31], serving as one of the 
crucial theoretical frameworks for chatbot interventions. In 
recent years, a number of mental health chatbots have emerged, 
and their effectiveness has been tested through randomized 
controlled trials, providing interventions for different mental 
health problems, with Woebot [32], Tess [33,34], Wysa [35], 
Vivibot [36], and XiaoNan [37] directly targeting depression 
and anxiety symptoms; Shim [38], SABORI [39], and Bella 
[40] directly targeting stress, well-being, or quality of life; and 
MYLO [41-43] and Help4Mood [44] directly targeting general 
psychological distress such as problem solving and negative 
cognition. 
The technology and format of chatbots for mental health 
problems have evolved from script bots with only text 
communication to embodied conversational agents [45] with 
image and voice, and digital humans [40] and virtual humans 
[46], which discern and control emotional and facial expressions 
during interactions with individuals in real time, have also been 
reported. 
However, previous studies focused more on the role of a chatbot 
as a technical carrier in the intervention, neglecting the 
verification and innovation of the psychological process and 
content itself. As a result, there is a gap between the progress 
of psychology and AI in the field of digital mental health. 
Chatbots are intended to foster collaboration, integration, and 
co-development between psychological science and other fields 
[47]. Thus, a direct comparison between mental health chatbots 
and general chatbots is essential in a trial. Methodological 
limitations that existed in previous trials involved an insufficient 
sample size, a lack of follow-up assessment, failure to 
comprehensively investigate the long-term effectiveness of the 
intervention, and ignorance of the sensitivity analysis to ensure 
robustness of the conclusion. 
As an alternative and useful precursor to clinical effectiveness, 
nonclinical metrics are just as important as clinical outcomes 
and may contribute to further exploring the mechanism by which 
the mental health chatbots work [48]. Fitzpatrick et al [32] also 
noted that therapeutic process factors of mental health chatbots 
may facilitate or undermine the treatment. From the technical 
perspective, there is currently no standard method in use to 
evaluate mental health chatbots. As a result, we attempted to 
establish a systematic evaluation of nonclinical metrics for 
mental health chatbots covering adherence, engagement,

working alliance, usability, acceptability, and thematic analysis 
of users’ feedback. Working alliance (also known as “therapeutic 
alliance”) represents the cooperative and emotionally connected 
relationship between the client and the therapist, and is 
considered a common factor in psychotherapy outcomes [49] 
and a metric to assess the computer-patient relationship as well 
[50,51]. Three recent studies [52-55] by Dosovitsky et al, Beatty 
et al, and Darcy et al had emphasized the viability and 
significance of the relationship and working alliance in digital 
treatment, and several randomized controlled trials of mental 
health chatbots had employed the Working Alliance Inventory 
(WAI) as a measurement method of working alliance, with all 
of these demonstrating good measure effects [37,56,57]. 
Important issues to be addressed for chatbots in the future could 
be extracted from the perceptions and opinions of patients [58], 
and thematic analysis with a topic model is a qualitative research 
method to accurately capture and concisely present key 
information in texts [59]. 
A randomized controlled trial including 148 Chinese college 
students was conducted in this study to evaluate the performance 
and efficacy of a mental health chatbot (XiaoE) for depression. 
We expected that, compared with an e-book and a general 
chatbot, the mental health chatbot would be more effective in 
reducing depressive symptoms after 1-week treatment and that 
this effect would persist for 1 month after the intervention 
(primary hypothesis). Additionally, we hypothesized that the 
mental health chatbot would make it easier to build relationships 
with users, enhance engagement, and improve user experience 
during the therapeutic process (secondary hypothesis). 

Study Design and Participants 
The study was a single-blind, 3-arm randomized controlled trial 
performed at a university in Tianjin, China. College students 
were recruited from social media outlets, online platforms, and 
university communities or were referred here by their counselor 
in the counseling center. All potential participants were screened 
by counseling psychologists for eligibility against the following 
inclusion criteria: (1) age 17-34 years; (2) average score of the 
depression subscale in the College Students Mental Health 
Screening Scale (CSMHSS) [60] within 2 to 3; and (3) ability 
to read Chinese. Participants were excluded if they (1) reported 
a score of ≥3 for any item in the suicide subscale in the 
CSMHSS; (2) reported a standard score of >3 in the suicide 
subscale or hallucination/delusion subscale in the CSMHSS; or 
(3) were taking a psychiatric medication. The CSMHSS is the 
mainstream tool for mental health screening of college students 
in China. The screening scale includes 22 dimensions that 
involve the main mental health problems of college students 
and is divided into 3 levels of screening that indicate 3 levels 
of mental health risk. The CSMHSS is a relevant tool for the 
inclusion criteria because it can not only measure the degree of 
depressive symptoms but also screen out individuals with high 
mental health risk for exclusion. Moreover, the CSMHSS is 
easier to implement in a university with the help of 
corresponding assessment platforms, given the large number 
of recruits. Before the enrollment, the participants were required 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
to carefully read and sign the written informed consent form to 
confirm their acceptance of the study. Participants were provided 
with access to artificial psychological counseling services if 
they had any risk of suicide, self-injury, or severe psychological 
distress during or after the trial, to avoid further damage. At the 
end of the trial, participants in control conditions were offered 
access to XiaoE. The trial was prospectively registered with the 
ChiCTR 
(number: 
registry on October 30, 2021 
ChiCTR2100052532). Final data were collected on December 
16, 2021. Participants received a compensation of RMB 70 
(approximately US $10) for their participation in this trial. 

Randomization and Masking 
Randomization with stratification by gender was performed via 
computer programs independently developed by the technical 
development team of XiaoE. Participants who were randomly 
assigned (1:1:1) 
the mental health chatbot 
intervention, e-book intervention, or general chatbot intervention 
would automatically enter the corresponding intervention 
process when they checked into XiaoE for the first time. 
Treatment allocation was masked 
from participants, 
investigators, and those involved in analyzing trial data, as it 
was saved in an encrypted electronic file form by multiple 
parties (the study designer, trial implementer, data processor, 
and technical development representative) and unblinded after 
the completion of data analysis. The intervention as well as the 
outcome measure were completed online, and none of the 
investigators had access to the participants’ systems during the 
intervention period (single blind). 
Procedure 
The intervention lasted for 1 week. On the day of enrollment 
(T0), baseline data were collected, including a pretest of the 
primary outcome measure (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire 
[PHQ-9]) and demographic information. A posttest of the 
primary outcome was performed 1 week later (T1), accompanied 
by the secondary outcomes working alliance, usability, and 
acceptability. A final follow-up assessment of the primary 
outcome was carried out 30 days after enrollment (T2). 
XiaoE 
XiaoE is an unguided CBT-based chatbot developed for 
depression, which can be used in screening, prevention, and 
self-assistance for depressive symptoms through a fully 
automatic intelligent interaction with users (text, image, and 
voice). The technology of XiaoE is rooted in natural language 
processing (NLP) and deep learning [61]. The whole chatbot 
dialogue system has been constructed through the open-source 
framework RASA [62], with content about mental health 
produced, discussed, and supervised by a psychologist panel 
led by several experienced clinical and counseling experts from 
schools and hospitals. XiaoE provides self-assistance service 
via the WeChat Official Accounts Platform. The objective of 
the development of XiaoE is not to replace human therapists, 
but to provide a convenient self-help intervention to users failing 
to receive immediate mental health services. It can also serve 
as an auxiliary tool to cooperate with traditional psychological 
counseling and treatment, covering functions including campus 
and epidemic-related counseling, adolescent mental health

(page number not for citation purposes) 


screening and diagnostics, automated CBT-based chatbot 
interventions, intelligent multiturn conversations, artificial 
psychological counseling, and “tree hole” (a place to share 
thoughts and secrets). Participants in this condition were exposed 
to only the automated CBT-based chatbot intervention. Based 
on the principles of CBT, multiturn dialogue [63] and 
personalized customization were taken as the main intervention 
forms by referring to the content and process of several mature 
CBT-based chatbots [20] and internet-delivered cognitive 
behavioral therapy (ICBT) apps [64]. The following 7 modules 
were designed: “Cognition Challenge,” “Improve Self-esteem,” 
“Learn to Relax,” “Energy List,” “Wonderful World,” “Are 
You OK,” and “Escape from Loneliness,” and they correspond 
to the 7 concepts of psychology, cognitive distortions, 
self-esteem, mindfulness meditation, mental energy, natural 
connection, self-help, and loneliness, respectively. Participants 
were asked to complete a module per day in sequence during 
the 1-week intervention period, as well as a separate module 
called “Gratitude Journal” for recording positive events and 
mood every day. 
XiaoE is equipped with complete process guidance and daily 
task reminders. During the implementation of the trial, the 
participants were only required to follow the guidance of XiaoE 
every day, where the staff only provided answers to technical 
or operational questions. In addition, the interaction data of 
engagement and use of XiaoE can be obtained in the background 
of the system. The data could not be obtained from the control 
groups because the interactions occurred outside the XiaoE 
system. As a result, the interaction frequency in the control 
groups was measured in the form of a self-rating questionnaire 
at the end of the trial. 
e-Book 
Participants in control group 1 were arranged to read an e-book 
about depression, I Had a Black Dog [65], which is a classic 
book that introduces depression knowledge to the public and 
guides to help depressed patients serve themselves from the 
first-person perspective of depressed patients and their 
companions. The World Health Organization adopted the 
animated version as its official promotional video [66] on the 
theme of depression. In addition, participants in the group were 
presented with a high-quality depression-related article daily, 
with the theme of each article corresponding to the daily theme 
of the functional modules of the intervention group. 
Xiaoai 
Participants in control group 2 were asked to communicate with 
Xiaoai at least once a day. Xiaoai is a chatbot in China designed 
to cater to the demands of a wider audience for small talk and 
not particularly for mental health services such as depression. 
The chat content between participants and Xiaoai was 
unrestricted. However, we limited the daily conversation topics 
(corresponding to the daily functional modules of the 
intervention group) and proposed specific chat tasks to the 
participants. For example, the topic on day 2 was self-esteem, 
and we endorsed that participants share their perspectives and 
feelings on self-esteem with Xiaoai, discuss “how self-esteem 
affects our emotional state and what is the relationship between 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
it and depression,” assess their current level of self-esteem with 
Xiaoai, and ask for advice on “how to improve it.” 

Primary Outcome 
The primary outcome was the score of the PHQ-9 [67], which 
is one of the most widely used, reliable, and validated measures 
of depressive symptoms. It is a 9-item self-report questionnaire 
that assesses the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms 
within the previous 2 weeks based on the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) 
criteria for major depressive disorder on a 4-point scale from 0 
(not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Scores ranging from 0 to 5 
indicate no symptoms of depression, and scores of 5-9, 10-14, 
15-20, and 20 represent mild, moderate, moderately severe, and 
severe depression, respectively. 


Secondary Outcomes 
The secondary outcomes were the scores of the Working 
Alliance Questionnaire (WAQ) [68], the Usability Metric for 
User Experience-LITE 
the 
Acceptability Scale (AS). The WAQ is based on the Helping 
Alliance Questionnaire (HAq-II), WAI, and California 
Psychotherapy Alliance Scales (CAL-PAS), with three 4-item 
subscales assessing the development of an affective bond in 
treatment and the level of agreement with treatment goals and 
treatment tasks. The scores of all 12 items range from 0 (rarely) 
to 5 (always). Usability, as “the extent to which a product can 
be used by specified users to achieve specific goals with 
effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context 
of use” [70], was assessed by the UMUX-LITE, with 2 items 
to assess usefulness and ease of use, respectively, ranging from 
0 (rarely) to 5 (always). Acceptability, referring to psychological 
acceptability for the therapeutic process and content, was 
assessed using a 5-point Likert scale (AS), referring to items 
used in previous studies on mental health chatbots [33,71] 
covering overall satisfaction, content satisfaction, emotional 
awareness, learning new knowledge, relevance to daily life, and 
promotion of the self-help process. 
Statistical Analyses 
Sample size calculation was conducted with G* Power (version 
3) [72]. Latest research showed a large effect (d=0.83) of a 
chatbot intervention for depression in college students [37]. On 
the assumption that a replication study might be expected to 
achieve broadly similar results, we calculated that a sample size 
of 32 in each group would have 90% power to detect a net effect 
size of 0.83, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with a 
2-sided significance level of .05, while also allowing for a 20% 
loss to follow-up. 
Difference tests were conducted with SPSS (version 26; IBM 
Corp). In order to determine whether any significant differences 
between groups existed at baseline, F tests with one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed on continuous 
baseline variables (PHQ-9 and age), and chi-square analyses 
were performed on categorical or nominal variables (gender, 
ethnicity, only child, single parent, religion, home location, and 
parental marriage). The same comparisons of baseline 
J Med Internet Res 2022 | vol. 24 | iss. 11 | e40719 | p. 4 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


characteristics were conducted between dropouts and 
participants who completed the study. Adjusted mean changes 
in the PHQ-9 score from baseline to T1 and T2 were analyzed 
as the primary efficacy endpoint using an ANCOVA model 
with the treatment group as the fixed effect and the 
corresponding baseline value as the covariate. A covariate was 
removed from the statistical model in case of significant 
interaction effects being found between this covariate and the 
group. A post-hoc test with Bonferroni correction was employed 
for multiple group comparisons. η2 was calculated and converted 
to Cohen d to examine the effect size of the group difference 
[73]. A Cohen d of 0.2 represents a small effect; 0.5, a moderate 
effect; and 0.8, a large effect [74]. F tests with ANOVA were 
performed for the results of secondary outcomes. 
The results of both the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis [75] on 
the full analysis set (all enrolled participants) and the 
per-protocol (PP) analysis on the PP set (participants in the full 
analysis set without important protocol violations leading to 
exclusion) were reported by including all available observations 
in the analysis [76]. Using mi impute within Stata (version 15; 
StataCorp), we processed missing data via multiple imputation 
(MI) methods and performed further sensitivity analysis via 
δ-based methods [77]. 
There are 3 broad classes of missing data mechanism 
assumptions [78]: missing completely at random (MCAR), 
missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). 
MI is based on MAR, where the probability of a datum being 
missing does not depend on the unobserved value of the datum, 
but only depends on the observed values of other recorded 
variables. Nevertheless, missing data may not necessarily 
conform to MAR. Instead, they may follow MNAR, where the 
probability of a datum being missing does depend on the 
unobserved value of the datum, even given the observed data. 
We cannot distinguish between MNAR and both MAR and 
MCAR since the true values of missing data are never known, 
which means the results of MI may be biased. The publication 
of ICH E9 (R1) [79], addendum on estimands and sensitivity 
analysis in clinical trials, states that sensitivity analysis of 
missing data should be performed to ensure the robustness of 
the results. As a result, we performed a sensitivity analysis with 
δ-based methods to see if the effect remained significant when 
missing data followed MNAR. δ-based MI entails modifying 
the MAR imputation distribution using a specified numerical 
delta parameter to make predicted responses better or worse 
than predicted under MAR. For a continuous outcome, δ, the 
offset parameter can represent the difference in the mean 
response between the observed and unobserved cases [80]. 
Usually, the sensitivity analysis will repeat for a range of δ 
values corresponding to 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the 
absolute change from baseline of outcomes in all participants. 
Adherence is revealed by chi-square analysis of the attrition of 
participants, and engagement is revealed by the frequency and 
duration of the interaction with the chatbot. An interaction was 
considered a session if there was engagement with the chatbot 
lasting at least 2 user inputs within 2 minutes and a break no 
longer than 1 minute. Mean interaction frequency was defined 
as the average number of sessions each participant had with the 
chatbot per day during the 1-week intervention period. Mean 
interaction duration was defined as the average response time 
of each session calculated in milliseconds between the first time 
the user inputs content and the last time the chatbot outputs 
content per day. The 1-week intervention period was divided 
into days 1 through 7, and each day’s 24 hours were divided 
into 12 two-hour time periods. We recorded and calculated the 
mean interaction frequency and mean interaction duration for 
the 7 days and the 12 time periods. We recontacted all the 
enrolled participants after all the follow-up measurements were 
finished and opened access to XiaoE. They were asked 3 
open-ended questions at the end of the trial: “What was your 
best experience using XiaoE?” “What was your worst experience 
using XiaoE?” and “Please make some personal comments or 
suggestions on XiaoE.” We ran a thematic analysis on 
participants’ feedback using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) 
[81], an unsupervised learning algorithm, with Pycharm (version 
2020.2.2). In order to confirm the optimal number of themes 
for participants’ feedback on each question, the perplexity under 
different numbers of themes should be calculated, and the topic 
model with the minimum perplexity should be selected. Five 
keywords were extracted from each theme, and each theme was 
named by combining keywords and original feedback text 
labeled as corresponding themes. 
Ethics Approval 
The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics 
Committee of Tianjin Anding Hospital (Tianjin Mental Health 
Center; number: 2021-21). All participants provided informed 
consent. 

Participant Characteristics 
Figure 1 shows the participant flow (CONSORT flow diagram) 
[82]. A total of 379 college students were assessed for eligibility 
and enrolled between September 1, 2021, and November 15, 
2021, of whom 143 did not meet the study criteria, 48 could 
not be contacted again, 19 declined to participate, 15 did not 
sign the written informed consent form, and 6 failed to complete 
the baseline measure. Ultimately, 148 participants were enrolled 
and randomized, of whom 49 were allocated to use the mental 
health chatbot (XiaoE), 49 were allocated to read the e-book, 
and 50 were allocated to use the general chatbot (Xiaoai). 
Participants were on average 18.78 years old (SD 0.89; range 
17-21 years), and 37.2% (55/148) were female. The mean 
PHQ-9 score was 10.02 (SD 3.18; range 2-19) at baseline, just 
reaching the level of moderate depression. There were no 
significant differences in baseline characteristics among the 3 
arms, as well as between dropouts and participants who 
completed the study (Table 1). Five participants (1 from the 
XiaoE group and 4 from the Xiaoai group) were identified by 
counseling psychologists as high risk during and after the course 
of the trial and underwent artificial psychological counseling.

Depressive symptoms significantly reduced more among 
participants in the XiaoE group in comparison with controls, 
and a moderate between-group effect size was reported at T1 
(F2,136=17.011; P<.001; d=0.51), while a small effect size was 
reported at T2 (F2,136=5.477; P=.005; d=0.31) (Table 2). The 
post-hoc test with Bonferroni correction revealed significant 
treatment differences with XiaoE versus e-book and Xiaoai in 
the reduction of depression at T1 (P=.04 and P<.001, 
respectively) and T2 (P=.049 and P=.006, respectively) (Figure

PP Analysis 
At T1, no significant interaction effects existed between group 
and baseline PHQ-9 score (P=.59), age (P=.88), gender (P=.47), 
ethnicity (P=.44), only child (P=.39), single parent (P=.86), 
religion (P=.69), home location (P=.21), and parental marriage 
(P=.57) with the ANCOVA model. Similarly, at T2, no 
significant interaction effects existed between group and baseline

(P=.95), only child (P=.11), single parent (P=.37), religion 
(P=.68), home location (P=.53), and parental marriage (P=.52) 
with the ANCOVA model. 
Depressive symptoms significantly reduced more among 
participants in the XiaoE group in comparison with controls, 
and a moderate between-group effect size was reported at T1 
(F2,113=26.168; P<.001; d=0.62), while a small effect size was 
reported at T2 (F2,94=6.408; P=.002; d=0.43) (Table 2). The 
post-hoc test revealed significant treatment differences with 
XiaoE versus e-book and Xiaoai in the reduction of depression 
at T1 (P<.001 and P<.001, respectively) and a significant 
difference between XiaoE and Xiaoai (P=.003) but no significant 
difference between XiaoE and e-book (P=.08) at T2 (Figure 2). 
Use and Engagement 
As shown in Figure 3, participants in the XiaoE group interacted 
with the chatbot for 25.54 sessions (SD 26.45; range 0-172) on 
average per day, and each session lasted an average of 22.46 
seconds (SD 79.88; range 0-758 seconds) over the 1-week 
period. The daily frequency and duration of the interaction were 
high on day 1, day 2, and day 7, while they were relatively low 
on day 3, day 5, and day 6, and rebounded to some extent on 
day 4. The frequency of the interaction reached peaks in the 3 
time periods of 8-10 AM, 12-2 PM, and 4-6 PM per day. 
According to the answers of participants in the e-book group, 
2% (1/49) had not read it once, 51% (25/49) had read it once, 
and 47% (23/49) had read it twice or more. In the Xiaoai group, 
29% (14/48) said they interacted with Xiaoai once a day, 27% 
(13/48) said twice a day, and 44% (21/48) said 3 or more times 
a day.

Thematic Analysis 
According to the chart of themes-perplexity of LDA (Figure 4), 
the number of themes reported in the question “What was your 
best experience using XiaoE?” was set to 4 and the number of 
themes reported in the question “What was your worst 
experience using XiaoE?” was set to 2. Table 5 lists all the 
themes and keywords for participants’ feedback. The last 
question “comments or suggestions” was analyzed with a 
qualitative method because the result of LDA was not ideal. 
The following 4 themes emerged in respect to the feedback to 
the question regarding the best experience: “relationship” 
(n=25), “emotion” (n=12), “personalization” (n=31), and 
“practicability” (n=80). The keywords extracted from the 
relationship theme were “company,” “care,” “loneliness,” 
“favor,” and “attending,” and the corresponding labeled example 
text was “XiaoE is very sweet, I like to talk to XiaoE, he will 
accompany and accept me, so I don't feel lonely.” The keywords 
for the emotion theme were “happy,” “relax,” “stress,” 
“catharsis,” and “company,” and the example text was “always 
makes me laugh! Ha ha ha ha, the pressure suddenly 
disappeared, and I am so happy.” The keywords for the 
personalization theme were “thinking,” “learning,” “depression,” 
“mood,” and “intelligence,” and the example was “The best 
experience is that sometimes XiaoE’s answers are indeed 
valuable and can really target some of my questions, which is 
very intelligent and promotes thinking.” The keywords for the 
practicability theme were “convenience,” “help,” “reality,” 
“method,” and “usability,” and the example was “practical, real 
and convenient, can help me.” 
The following 2 themes emerged in respect to the feedback to 
the question regarding the worst experience: “content” (n=120) 
and “technology” (n=28). The keywords extracted from the 
theme were “inflexible,” “response,” “tedious,” 
content 
“repetitive,” and “mechanical,” and the corresponding labeled 
example text was “The content is too rigid. It will make people 
feel bored and irritable if used for a long time.” The keywords 
extracted from the technology theme were “glitches,” “lag,” 
“system,” “crash,” and “inflexible,” and the example text was 
“crashed when I just entered the interface, and some glitches 
need to be optimized.” 
The participants’ feedback on the question “comments or 
suggestions” can be mainly extracted into the following 3 
themes: hope for a more fluent process of dialogue, more 
emotional response and interaction, and server upgrade.

Principal Findings 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly compare the 
clinical efficacy of a mental health chatbot with a general 
chatbot performing automated teletreatment for depressive 
symptoms. We tested both the short- and long-term effectiveness 
of XiaoE via a single-blind, 3-arm randomized controlled trial 
and established a systematic evaluation of nonclinical metrics 
for mental health chatbots so as to offer references for future 
research. 
Participants in this trial were on average 18.78 years old, and 
they were younger than samples of typical studies with adults 
or college students, indicating that research on mental health 
chatbots is translating to samples of adolescents. In addition, 
more men took part in this study than in previous studies, where 
the majority of participants were women. Given that there are 
currently no well-done studies on adolescents, we hope to see 
more of them in the future. 
In terms of attrition, participants in the XiaoE group dropped 
out at a lower rate than those in the e-book and Xiaoai groups. 
XiaoE was associated with a high level of engagement, which 
rose to the highest level particularly at the beginning and toward 
the end of the trial, demonstrating that XiaoE was attractive to 
participants and could quickly establish relationships when 
participants came into contact with this novel AI. The 
participants using XiaoE were most active from 12 to 2 PM 
every day, which may be related to the automatic task reminder 
set after 12 PM once a day by XiaoE. However, a large 
fluctuation in engagement could be observed regarding the trend 
of weekly activation and daily activation, which indicated that 
the relationships between participants and XiaoE were not steady 
and firm enough. 
ITT analysis showed a significantly better effectiveness of 
XiaoE for depression in comparison with that of the 2 controls 
for 1 week, achieving a moderate effect size (d=0.51), which 
was between the effect sizes of 2 previous studies [32,33] 
(Woebot: d=0.44; Tess: d=0.68) and remained robust in 
sensitivity analysis. The results of the long-term reduction of 
depressive symptoms 1 month later were statistically significant 
as well, while achieving a small effect size (d=0.31). PP analysis 
also showed significant short- and long-term effectiveness (T1, 
d=0.62; T2, d=0.43). As in previous studies [76], the results of 
the ITT analysis were lower than those of the PP analysis. 
However, opposite results were found in separate comparisons 
of the XiaoE and e-book groups. The difference between XiaoE 
and e-book was significant in the ITT analysis (despite failing 
to pass the test of the sensitivity analysis), but not in the PP 
analysis. Protocol deviations and the interaction between 
compliance and the intervention, which can lead to better 
outcomes for compliers in the active group but just the opposite 
(better for noncompliers) in the control group, are commonly 
thought to be the causes of the bias in the PP analysis. In this 
study, nevertheless, the effectiveness for compliers of the e-book 
group may also be overestimated due to the favorable impact 
of compliance, which may be more significant than that in the 
XiaoE group. Therefore, the difference between the 2 groups 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
was not significant in the PP analysis. This shows that mental 
health chatbots should fortify the therapeutic alliance even more 
to increase the intervention compliance of participants. 
It is necessary to note that while there was a significant 
improvement in symptoms via the mental health chatbot 
intervention, the magnitude of the improvement was small. As 
a result, the mental health chatbot is better suited as an auxiliary 
tool to work in conjunction with traditional psychological 
counseling and treatment or as the primary care approach for 
the treatment of mental illness. Although it is challenging to 
swiftly implement the intervention in real clinical practice, at 
least for the time being, the intervention is effective and 
convenient for individuals who desire to access self-help mental 
health services. This makes sense, since those represent a much 
larger group of people, and the spread of this unguided tool will 
greatly reduce the cost of human and financial resources. 



XiaoE exhibited a significant high level of acceptability and 
work alliance with participants but a nonsignificant high level 
of usability. This shows that XiaoE has preliminarily reached 
the standard of capacity in relationship establishment, but some 
aspects, such as the user interface and the operating system, still 
need to be further simplified for users. Participants reported 
having received the best experience with XiaoE in the 4 themes 
of 
and 
“practicality.” The theme of “relationship” reflected the 
establishment, development, and function of the relationship 
between XiaoE and participants, as Dosovitsky et al [52] found 
that individuals can form a positive bond with an AI chatbot 
owing to its personality traits, such as being caring, open to 
listening, and nonjudgmental. The theme of “emotion” reflected 
that communication with XiaoE was helpful for emotional 
expression and catharsis, and made users feel accompanied and 
understood. The same themes were also observed in previous 
studies [32,33]. The theme of “personalization” reflected that 
XiaoE can make different suggestions for different emotional 
distresses put forward by the participants, which can trigger 
more thinking and learning of the participants. At the beginning 
of the content design of XiaoE, in order to avoid an overly 
sermonizing feeling, we added many simple and specific tips. 
This could be the reason why participants considered XiaoE to 
be practical (“practicality”). The worst experiences reported 
mainly focused on “content” and “technology.” 
As mentioned earlier, the use of psychology in chatbots is still 
superficial. Despite the fact that our content was based on CBT, 
we discovered through our thematic analysis that participant 
comments barely made any mention of it. XiaoE’s conversations 
do not always emphasize CBT itself to participants, similar to 
how patients receiving therapy from a human therapist may feel 
like they are improving but not know what kind of therapy they 
are actually receiving. On the other hand, it is evident that CBT 
has its limitations. Even though CBT is a highly structured 
therapy, translating a typical CBT-based psychotherapy into a 
chatbot setting is difficult. 
Comparison With Prior Work 
We added a general chatbot (Xiaoai) intervention as a control 
condition to demonstrate the significance of psychological 
design and content for mental health chatbots. Interestingly, 
J Med Internet Res 2022 | vol. 24 | iss. 11 | e40719 | p. 14 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


participants who interacted with Xiaoai showed a small 
worsening of depressive symptoms after receiving the 1-week 
intervention. This indicates that using a general chatbot to treat 
mental health problems may be harmful, and a specifically 
designed chatbot for mental health may be required to alleviate 
depressive symptoms. In this study, follow-up was added to 
investigate the long-term effectiveness, and δ-based sensitivity 
analysis was performed to ensure the robustness of the 
conclusion. We established an innovative systematic evaluation 
of nonclinical metrics for mental health chatbots, and LDA was 
applied for the first time in the thematic analysis of users’ 
feedback as the sample size increased. 
Limitations and Future Directions 
There were some limitations in this study: First, due to the 
particularity of the tool and the consideration of actual 
recruitment, it was below capacity to double-blind both the 
investigators and the participants. For the convenience of 
management, an online group was set up for the 148 enrolled 
participants to provide important information and technical 
solutions during the implementation process of the trial, which, 
as a potential risk, may have resulted in an attempt to reveal 
different contents of their own interventions, thus imposing 
subjective influence on the effectiveness for other participants. 
Special attention should be paid to this in future online research. 
Second, the 1-week intervention period in this study was 
relatively short, and the results might have shown some 
difference if the intervention was prolonged. It can be concluded 
from the trend of weekly activation that engagement with XiaoE 
had a wide fluctuation range and XiaoE showed strong 
attractiveness, but it rapidly faded in the middle of the trial. It 
may have resulted from repeated interactions with the inflexible 
and tedious content, as well as technical problems such as 
glitches and lag. It can be speculated that the chatbot may be 
more suitable for a short-term intervention rather than a 
long-term intervention, which needs to be explored in further 
studies with a longer treatment period. Third, for the control 
condition, the strength of evidence for the intervention itself 
was still limited, and the e-book intervention, as a self-help 
approach, only involved the concept of psychological education, 
and it was not equipped with a complete set of programs for 
psychological therapy [83] or designed for multiple or recurring 
sessions. Therefore, it is better to choose other active control 
approaches whose efficacy has been clearly proven, including 
traditional face-to-face therapy, online psychological counseling, 
ICBT, and VR. Fourth, as we could only gather self-reported 
involvement in the control groups as opposed to comprehensive 
objective data in the treatment group, it was not possible to 
directly compare the engagement of the XiaoE group with that 
of the control groups. Future research should also collect 
behavioral data in control groups corresponding to the data in 
the treatment group as the basis for comparison. Finally, this 
study involved students from a single university in Tianjin, 
China, and it was not determined whether the conclusion can 
be extended to a larger group. This can be addressed by 
attempting to perform multicenter randomized controlled trials 
in the future. 
In the postepidemic era, people’s lifestyles have undergone 
profound transformations, and digital technology and internet 
informatization have drawn more attention than ever. It is 
reasonable to predict that in the future, chatbot-based digital 
psychotherapy will play a significant role in the field of mental 
health care [84]. This will provide new clinical guidelines and 
technical viewpoints to relevant psychologists, psychiatrists, 
and AI researchers and practitioners. 
At present, there are many digital therapeutic approaches with 
excellent psychological content, with little attention to the 
effective factors in the psychological therapeutic process, such 
as emotional response, therapeutic alliance, empathy, and 
personalization. Despite people’s doubt regarding whether 
machines can provide emotional experiences, they typically 
respond better to agents that express emotions than those that 
do not [85], illustrating the importance of a positive therapeutic 
alliance in the internet environment in the absence of therapist 
support [86]. Chatbots with sophisticated empathic capabilities 
can enrich user experience and affinity. The concept of empathic 
chatbots has been proposed [87], accompanied with system 
design and development [88], but there is no mature product 
present and effectiveness has not been tested yet. The utilization 
of user profiles or user models to support personalized and 
adaptive features, and assessments for personalization are still 
limited in mental health chatbots [89]. Thus, the technologies 
of chatbots, particularly NLP [61] and multiturn dialogue [60], 
require to be constantly upgraded, and the user interface and 
operating system should be modified to improve user experience. 
Future chatbots can be targeted at more mental health problems, 
such as anxiety, insomnia, well-being, stress, and addiction. 
Meanwhile, ethical issues with AI, such as privacy, security, 
information disclosure, and harm avoidance need to be carefully 
considered [90]. 
Conclusions 
The mental health chatbot XiaoE can be used as a feasible, 
engaging, and effective digital intervention for college students 
with depressive symptoms. Compared with a general chatbot, 
XiaoE exhibited significant short-term and 
long-term 
effectiveness that remained robust after sensitivity analysis, 
illustrating the unique role of psychological design and process 
in the field of digital mental health. XiaoE showed special 
capacity for building relationships with users, enhancing 
engagement, and improving user experience during the 
therapeutic process. Further evidence is required to confirm the 
long-term effectiveness via trails replicated with a longer dose, 
as well as exploration of its greater efficacy in comparison with 
other active controls.
