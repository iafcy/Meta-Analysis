Background: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted access to treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs), while 
alcohol and cannabis retail sales increased. During the pandemic, we tested a tailored digital health solution, 
Woebot-SUDs (W-SUDs), for reducing substance misuse. 
Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, we compared W-SUDs for 8 weeks to a waitlist control. U.S. adults (N 
= 180) who screened positive for substance misuse (CAGE-AID>1) were enrolled June–August 2020. The pri- 
mary outcome was the change in past-month substance use occasions from baseline to end-of-treatment (EOT). 
Study retention was 84%. General linear models tested group differences in baseline-to-EOT change scores, 
adjusting for baseline differences and attrition. 
Results: At baseline, the sample (age M = 40, SD = 12, 65% female, 68% non-Hispanic white) averaged 30.2 (SD 
= 18.6) substance occasions in the past month. Most (77%) reported alcohol problems, 28% cannabis, and 45% 
multiple substances; 46% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Treatment participants averaged 
920 in-app text messages (SD = 892, Median = 701); 96% of completed lessons were rated positively; and 88% 
would recommend W-SUDs. Relative to waitlist, W-SUDs participants significantly reduced past-month substance 
use occasions (M = (cid:0) 9.1, SE = 2.0 vs. M = (cid:0) 3.3, SE = 1.8; p = .039). Secondary substance use and mood 
outcomes did not change significantly by group; however, reductions in substance use occasions correlated 
significantly with increased confidence and fewer substance use problems, cravings, depression and anxiety 
symptoms, and pandemic-related mental health effects (p-value<.05). 
Conclusions: W-SUDs was associated with significant reductions in substance use occasions. Reduction in sub- 
stance use occasions was associated with better outcomes, including improved mental health. W-SUDs satis- 
faction was high. 

The 2016 Surgeon General’s Report on Facing Addiction in America 
warned that community-wide disasters can disrupt treatment services 
and/or increase stress, precipitating relapse or heavier substance use (U. 
S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2016). Before the 
COVID-19 pandemic, addiction treatment in the U.S. reached less than 
one in five individuals who met diagnostic criteria for a substance use 
disorder (SUD) (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration, 2019). The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted treatment 
access further, while retailers selling alcohol and, in some states, 
cannabis, were deemed essential businesses. In March 2020, compared 
to the year prior, alcohol retail sales increased 54% and online alcohol 
sales increased 262% (The Nielsen Company, 2020). Surges in 
cannabis sales were recorded in March 2020, and sales growth for the 
year was 40% stronger than 2019 (Vangst et al., 2020). 
The pandemic’s extended physical distancing demands coupled with 
the many social, medical, political, racial/ethnic and economic stressors

of 2020 could escalate substance misuse, relapse, and the development 
of SUDs in at-risk individuals (Clay and Parker, 2020). In late June 2020, 
13% of U.S. adults reported initiating or increasing substance use to 
cope with pandemic-related stress (Czeisler et al., 2020). Demands 
during and following the pandemic may overwhelm already strained 
addiction treatment services. 
Digital health applications (apps) can reduce barriers to traditional 
SUD treatment including stigma, costs and inadequate insurance 
coverage, time demands, transportation needs, lack of access to quali- 
fied providers, and challenges navigating complex treatment systems 
(Giroux et al., 2017). Preliminary evidence suggests that digital SUD 
interventions can reduce substance misuse (Boumparis et al., 2019; 
Giroux et al., 2017). Scalable digital SUD interventions could lessen the 
population-level burden of SUDs. 
A novel approach for scaling therapeutic interactions without 
requiring human involvement is the use of artificial intelligence (AI). 
Programmed therapeutic relational agents can deliver a coach-like or 
sponsor-like experience for in-the-moment treatment delivery (Vaidyam 
et al., 2019). Evidence suggests that people are more likely to disclose 
personal information when they believe the interactions are computer- 
rather than human-monitored (Lucas et al., 2014); and a strong thera- 
peutic alliance can develop in the absence of face-to-face contact (Cook 
and Doyle, 2002), even with a non-human app (Berry et al., 2018). 
While most mental health apps have high drop-off (Baumel et al., 2019; 
Torous et al., 2018), a meta-analysis found that conversational 
text-based agents may increase engagement and enjoyment in digitized 
mental health care (Vaidyam et al., 2019). Preliminary research in- 
dicates text-based presentation results in higher program adherence 
than verbal presentation (Tielman et al., 2017). 
In an 8-week, single-group pre/post evaluation, we recently evalu- 
ated Woebot for Substance Use Disorders (W-SUDs) (Prochaska et al., 
2021). W-SUDs was adapted from Woebot, a therapeutic relational agent 
found to decrease depressive symptoms (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017). 
Delivered via a smartphone app, W-SUDs provides psychoeducation in 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)–based behavior change tools and 
encourages mood tracking and behavioral pattern insight. Participants 
were found to engage with W-SUDs regularly, reporting high accept- 
ability and affective bond formation. From pre- to post-treatment, sig- 
nificant reductions were reported in substance use occasions, hazardous 
alcohol and drug use, and cravings to use substances, while confidence 
to resist substance use urges increased (Prochaska et al., 2021). 
Depression and anxiety symptoms significantly declined. Given these 
encouraging findings, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of W-SUDs 
relative to a waitlist group in a randomized controlled trial. The trial was 
conducted in summer 2020, when the need for novel in-hand treatment 
options was amplified due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 


We evaluated W-SUDs in an 8-week, two-group randomized 
controlled trial with a waitlist comparison condition. The primary 
outcome was change in past-month substance use occasions self- 
reported at baseline and end-of-treatment (EOT). Secondary outcomes 
were changes in substance use problems, craving intensity, confidence 
to resist substance use urges, mood symptoms (depression, anxiety), 
pain, and pandemic-related mental health effects. Intervention 
engagement data were collected from the W-SUDs app. Acceptability 
was assessed within the app and in the EOT survey. 

Study procedures were approved by Stanford Medicine’s Institu- 
tional Review Board. Participants were recruited June 25 to August 18, 
2020 via Qualtrics Research Services, Stanford listservs, Facebook, and 
word-of-mouth. Recruitment materials sought adults with substance use 
concerns. Informed consent was required for eligibility screening and 
study participation. 
Inclusion criteria were ages 18–65 years, residing in the U.S., scoring 
>1 on the CAGE-AID (Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye opener-Adapted 
to Include Drugs) (Brown and Rounds, 1995), owning a smartphone for 
accessing W-SUDs, available for the 8-week study, providing an email 
address, and English literacy. A cut-point of >1 on the CAGE-AID has a 
sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 85% for identifying individuals with 
SUDs (Brown and Rounds, 1995). Study exclusion criteria were prior 
Woebot use, anticipated pregnancy during the study period, history of 
severe alcohol or drug-related medical problems (e.g., delirium tremens, 
seizure, liver disease, hallucinations), opioid overdose requiring Narcan 
(naloxone), current opioid misuse without medication-assisted treat- 
ment, or past-year attempted suicide. To maximize study retention, we 
obtained participants’ phone numbers and provided up to U.S.$75 in 
Amazon gift cards for completing study assessments. 
Based on power calculations, with a two-sided rejection region, 
alpha level of 0.05, power of 80%, projected effect size of Cohen’s d = 
0.50, and 20% attrition, the target sample size was N = 80 per group or 
160 participants. Fig. 1 shows the study consort diagram, which is 
missing some exclusion information lost due to a clerical error. Based on 
captured data, leading reasons for study exclusion were a CAGE-AID 
score of 0 or 1 (n = 1149) and being unable to commit to the 8-week 
study 2 (n = 401). All 193 eligible individuals provided informed con- 
sent for study participation; 189 completed the baseline survey; how- 
ever, 5 were duplicates and 4 provided invalid contact information. In 
total, 180 participants were randomized to W-SUDs (n = 88) or the 
waitlist control (n = 92) group. Randomization was stratified on re- 
ported substance use problems on the SIP-AD measure (Blanchard et al., 
2003), described below. 


Woebot is a therapeutic relational agent that delivers CBT in the 
format of brief, daily text-based conversations through its own native 
app on iPhone and Android devices (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017). The app 
onboarding process introduces Woebot, explains the intended use of the 
device, how data are treated, and limitations of the program (e.g., that it 
is not a crisis service). Participants are encouraged to check-in with 
Woebot daily and informed that check-ins will invite weekly tracking of 
their mood and ratings of substance use craving and pain. Daily push 
notifications prompt users to check in. Woebot is introduced as a guided 
self-help coach and explicitly not human. Participants are educated that 
Woebot will offer emotional support, daily lessons, and tools for reducing 
substance use and manage cravings, all via the medium of text-based 
conversations. Conversations with Woebot are responsive in real-time 
to users’ inputs and crafted to offer the tool and or lesson for partici- 
pants’ moment of need. After the app onboarding process, Woebot hosts 
the first conversation with the participant and demonstrates app navi- 
gation and tool application. Woebot was adapted for the treatment of 
SUDs (W-SUDs), drawing upon motivational interviewing principles, 
mindfulness training, dialectical behavior therapy, and CBT for relapse 
prevention (Prochaska et al., 2021). The W-SUDs intervention offers 66 





psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapeutic skills and was 
designed as an 8-week treatment. Brief intervention can minimize 
dropout, a problem common to SUD treatment (Brorson et al., 2013). 
Given the sustained nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, content was 
added to W-SUDs to acknowledge pandemic-related stressors and 
isolation (Fig. 2). 




Study assessments were collected at baseline and EOT and were self- 
reported online via Qualtrics. Baseline demographic items were sex, 
race/ethnicity, age, marital and employment status, and zip code. Ten 
lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were assessed with a write-in option for 
others. Prior therapy experience (ever and current) and current psy- 
chiatric medication use were assessed. Engagement in SUD treatment in 
the past month at baseline and past 2 months at EOT (i.e., during the 
study period) was reported for self-help groups, outpatient, intensive 
outpatient, residential/inpatient, and medications to reduce substance 



use. Pandemic-related life disruptions were queried including changes in 
employment and income; engagement in COVID-19 precautionary be- 
haviors in the past 2 weeks (4-point scale: never to most of the time, see 
Table 1) (Lavoie and Bacon, 2020); difficulty accessing medical treat- 
ment or getting necessities (yes/no) (Lang, 2020); and COVID-19 
diagnosis. 
The specified primary outcome was the change from baseline to 8- 
weeks (EOT) in substance use occasions reported for the past 30 days. 
At baseline and EOT, the number of days used in the past 30 days was 
assessed for each of the following: alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, pre- 
scription stimulants, methamphetamine, inhalants, sedatives or sleeping 
pills, hallucinogens, street opioids, and prescription opioids. Because 
participants used different substances and not all drank alcohol, days of 
reported alcohol use and days of use for each assessed drug were sum- 
med to reflect past-month substance use occasions. Past-month sub- 
stance use occasions could exceed 30 if individuals used more than one 
substance on a day. Previously, this measure was found sensitive to 
treatment effects (Prochaska et al., 2021). Prior research has supported 
the validity of frequency measures of substance use consumption, which 
provide a continuous measure of the severity of harmful, problematic 
use (Moss et al., 2012) and when combined across substances, appro- 
to 
priately 
substance-related problems (Lennox et al., 2006). From the list, partic- 
ipants identified their primary and secondary (if applicable) substance 
(s) of abuse. 



Specified secondary outcomes were measures of substance use 
problems, craving, confidence, mood, pain, and pandemic-related 
mental health effects. The 15-item Short Inventory of Problem- 
s—Alcohol and Drugs (SIP-AD) assessed substance use problems in the 
past 30 days (Blanchard et al., 2003). The 10-item Drug Abuse Screening 
Test-10 (DAST-10) (Skinner, 1982) assessed drug-related consequences 
in the past 2 months, excluding alcohol and tobacco; total scores of 3+ 
indicate significant drug abuse problems. The DAST-10 item concerning 
drug-related medical problems was a screening exclusion criterion; 
hence, the sample’s total possible range was 0(cid:0) 9. Due to an online 
programming glitch, DAST-10 was not administered at EOT. Craving 
was assessed as: “In the past 7 days, how much were you bothered by 
cravings or urges to drink alcohol or use drugs?” from not at all (0) to 
extremely (4). The Brief Situational Confidence Questionnaire (Breslin 
et al., 2000) assessed self-confidence to resist the urge “right now” to 
drink heavily (self-defined) or use drugs in different situations from 0% 
“not at all confident” to 100% “totally confident.” The 8-item Patient 
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) assessed depressive symptoms (Kroenke 
et al., 2009). The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale 
assessed anxiety (Spitzer et al., 2006). Pain was assessed with a rating 
scale from 0 “no pain” to 100% “worst pain imaginable.” Pain inter- 
ference in one’s daily life was reported for the past 4 weeks, from not at 
all (0) to extremely (4). A 6-item measure assessed pandemic-related 
mental health effects experienced in the past 2 weeks including preoc- 
cupation with COVID-19 and worry about self/others’ health (0 = never 
to 4 = most of the time); stressfulness of changes in social contacts and in 
one’s lifestyle and worsening of mental/emotional health (0 = not at all 
to 4 = extremely); and sleep disruption (0 = no change, 1 = sleeping a 
little more/less, 2 = sleeping a lot more/less). The pandemic-related 
mental health effects total score had a possible range of 0–22 (Lang, 
2020). 
Serious adverse events occurring during the 8-week study were 
assessed 
including substance use-related hospitalization, suicide 
attempt, alcohol or drug overdose, and severe withdrawal (e.g., delirium 
tremens). Positive endorsements were queried for timing, diagnosis, and 
resolution and reported to the study’s Data Safety Monitoring Board 
within 72 h of the team learning of the event. 
At EOT, participants randomized to W-SUDs completed the Usage 
Rating Profile-Intervention (URP-I) Feasibility (6 items) and Accept- 
ability (6 items) scales (Briesch et al., 2013), the 8-item Client Satis- 
faction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) (Larsen et al., 1979), and the Working 
Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) with three 4-item subscales 
assessing development of an affective bond in treatment and level of 
agreement with treatment goals and treatment tasks (Hatcher and Gil- 
laspy, 2006). 
W-SUDs app use metrics included the number of days used; messages 
sent; modules completed; and mood, craving, and pain ratings submit- 
ted. Lesson acceptability was indicated thumbs up or down. 

Paired samples t-tests and chi-square tests compared the groups on 
baseline variables. EOT survey completion was 84% (152/180) and 
significantly higher for participants identifying as non-Hispanic white 
(89%) compared to other racial/ethnic groups (74%) and for partici- 
pants with a college degree (89%) relative to high school degree (74%) 
(p-values<.01). Retention also was higher for participants who at 
baseline reported more pandemic-related mental health effects and 
lower levels of craving, pain, and pain interference (p-values<.05). Of 
the 17 treatment participants lost to follow-up, 16 never registered with 
the W-SUDs app. Fig. 1 shows rates of noncompliance by condition. Two 
participants randomized to waitlist (2%) downloaded Woebot (not SUD- 
tailored) from the app store during the study period. Analyses followed 
the intent-to-treat protocol. 
General Linear Models (multivariate models) tested for group dif- 
ferences in changes in the primary outcome and secondary outcomes. 
The dependent variables were baseline to EOT change scores. The 
models adjusted for baseline group differences and applied weights to 
adjust for correlates of study retention. Participant weights were 
calculated as the inverse of predicted probability values from a logistic 
regression model predicting EOT retention with race/ethnicity, educa- 
tion, craving, pain intensity, and pandemic-related mental health ef- 
fects. Pain rating and pain interference were highly correlated (r = .74), 
due to missing data and multicollinearity, the pain rating item was not 
included. To examine associations among outcomes, bivariate correla- 
tions were run for the changes scores. Lastly, survey data were linked to 
treatment participants’ app use metrics and tested for associations. 


The sample (N = 180) averaged 40 years of age (SD = 12), was 65% 
female, 68% non-Hispanic white, and 56% partnered, residing in 34 U.S. 
states. At baseline, 3% (n = 6) reported a positive COVID-19 test or 
diagnosis. At EOT, one additional participant reported COVID-19 
diagnosis. 
Nearly a third (29%) of the sample identified as essential service 
workers; 56% of the sample reported pandemic-related employment 
disruption; 21% had difficulty getting food or medical treatment in the 
past 2 weeks. Most reported moderate-to-extremely negative pandemic- 
related effects on their mental/emotional health (64%); lifestyle (62%); 
and social connections (71%); 59% had disturbed sleep.

*p < .05 significant group differences on CAGE-AID score at screening and DAST-10 score at baseline. 
Most (77%) identified alcohol as their problematic substance, fol- 
lowed by cannabis (28%), stimulants (12%), and other (14%, e.g., club 
drugs, opioids, sedatives). A majority (59%) reported a lifetime psy- 
chiatric diagnosis, most commonly anxiety disorders (40%) and unipo- 
lar depression (28%); 12% reported a SUD diagnosis; 40% reported 
multiple diagnoses. Few (14%) were currently in therapy; 31% were 
currently taking psychiatric medication. Engagement in SUD treatment 
in the past 30 days was reported by 28% of participants, including 7% 
taking medications to reduce substance use. 
The full sample’s mean scores at baseline were 30 (SD = 19) for past- 
month substance use occasions; 12 (SD = 11) on the SIP-AD; 2 (SD = 2) 
on the DAST-10; 2 (SD = 1) for craving; 59% (SD = 23%) for confidence 
to resist substance use urges; and 12 (SD = 5) for pandemic-related 
mental health effects. Sample baseline mean scores on the PHQ-8 9 
(SD = 6), GAD-7 8 (SD = 6), pain rating 32 (SD = 28), and pain inter- 
ference 1 (SD = 1) were in the mild range. Baseline characteristics by 
group are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Waitlist participants had signifi- 
cantly higher CAGE-AID and DAST-10 scores than participants ran- 
domized to W-SUDs. All other baseline group comparisons were not 
statistically significant. 

Table 3 summarizes the results of eight general linear models testing 
group differences in the primary outcome and secondary outcomes. 
From baseline to EOT, participants randomized to W-SUDs reduced their 
substance use occasions significantly more than the waitlist group 
(F(1,148) = 4.53, p = .035). The estimated marginal mean reductions in 
past 30-day substance use occasions were -9.6 (SE = 2.3) for W-SUDs

Note: All dependent variables are changes scores calculated as EOT – baseline. General Linear Models were run to test for group differences adjusting for baseline 
differences (CAGE-AID and DAST-10) and applying weighted least squares analyses to adjust for differential retention. Weights were calculated as the inverse of 
predicted probability values from a logistic regression model of retention at EOT. The logistic regression model included baseline measures univariately associated with 
retention: non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity, college degree, craving, pain interference, and pandemic mental health effects. Eta2 = 0.01 indicates a small effect; Eta2

average two-fold greater for W-SUDs than the waitlist group, but not 
statistically significant (p = .175). Substance use problems, craving, 
depressive symptoms, anxiety, pain ratings, and pandemic-related 
mental health effects declined over time with no statistically signifi- 
cant difference between groups. 
At EOT, 24% (37/152) of participants reported engaging in SUD 
treatment (other than W-SUDs) during the 2-month study period with no 
significant difference by study condition (X2 
(1,152) = 0.52, p = .572). 
Engagement in SUD treatment during the study period, added as a co- 
variate to the model of substance use occasions, was not significant 
(F(1,147) = 0.31, p = .577) and did not alter the treatment effect for W- 
SUDs (F(1,147) = 4.53, p = .035). In the models of secondary outcomes, 
SUD treatment engagement was significantly associated with only anx- 
iety. Engaging in SUD treatment during the study period was associated 
with less reductions in anxiety (p < .001). 
Reduction in substance use occasions was significantly associated 
with reduction in substance use problems and both measures were 
significantly associated with gains in confidence and decreased cravings, 
depressive and anxiety symptoms, and pandemic-related mental health 
effects (Table 4). Confidence gains were significantly associated with 
improved mood and reduced cravings. Reductions in mood symptoms 
and pandemic-related mental health effects were significantly 
correlated. 

Of the 152 participants completing the EOT assessment, one reported 
a serious adverse event. The individual, randomized to waitlist, was 
hospitalized for alcohol detoxification. The DSMB deemed the event to 
be unrelated to study involvement. 

Table 5 summarizes treatment participants’ use of the W-SUDs app. 
Of the 88 participants randomized to W-SUDs, 77 (88%) registered with 
the app, using the app an average of 34.9 days (SD = 28.9, Median = 
31), and sending on average 1052 in-app text messages (SD = 878, 
Median = 881). Including the 11 participants who did not register with 
W-SUDs in the denominator, the treatment group averaged 920 in-app 
text messages (SD = 892, Median = 701). Engagement ranged from 
77 participants sending on average 172 messages (SD = 105, Median = 
182) at week 1–50 participants averaging 126 messages (SD = 89, Me- 
dian = 111) at week 8; 52 participants (68% of the 77 who registered) 
continued to message W-SUDs after 8 weeks. The correlation between 
the total count of in-app text messages and reduction in self-reported 
substance use occasions from baseline to EOT was r = (cid:0) .23, p = .06, 
n = 68.

submitted mood, craving, and pain ratings; 96% of completed lessons 
received a thumbs-up rating. The most frequently completed lesson, 
“COVID-19 Perspective,” received thumbs-up from 61 of 63 treatment 
participants (97%). Highest-rated lessons (100% thumbs up), completed 
by a majority of treatment participants, were on: urge surfing, labeling, 
the function of emotions, and gratitude. Participants provided craving 
and pain ratings nearly weekly, and mood ratings about four times a 
week. App engagement metrics were strongly correlated, ranging from r 
= .66 for the volume of mood ratings and in-app text messages to r = .98 
for entry of craving and pain ratings (p-values<.001). 
Participants currently in therapy rated lessons lower on average (M 
= 85% thumbs up) compared to those formerly or never in therapy (both 
M = 98% thumbs up, F(2,61) = 4.09, p = .022). Men (M = 48) completed 
more mood ratings than women (M = 33, F(1,63) = 4.02, p = .049). No 
other significant differences were found in app usage by participant 
characteristics. 
Table 6 summarizes treatment participants’ (n = 66) acceptability 
ratings of W-SUDs at EOT. Pairwise t-test comparisons for the three WAI- 
SR subscales, a measure of therapeutic alliance, indicated significantly 
higher ratings of W-SUDs on affective bond formation relative to 
agreement on treatment tasks (t(65) = 3.96, p < .001) and goals (t(65) = 
2.91, p = .005); scores for agreement on treatment goals and tasks did 
not significantly differ (t(65) = (cid:0) 1.78, p = .081). On the CSQ-8 indi- 
vidual items, most indicated that W-SUDs provided the kind of service 
they wanted (86%); provided good-to-excellent quality of interaction 
(89%); helped them deal more effectively with their problems (89%); 
and met most/almost all of their needs (74%). Additionally, 80% were 
mostly/very satisfied with the amount of help received and 85% were 
mostly/very satisfied with W-SUDs overall; 83% would return to W- 
SUDs; and 88% would recommend W-SUDs to a friend. 
Some significant differences were found in W-SUDs acceptability by 
participant baseline characteristics. Non-Hispanic white and ever- 
married participants gave higher URP-I feasibility ratings; participants 
with less education, no prior therapy experience, and greater substance 
use occasions had higher CSQ-8 satisfaction scores (p’s<.05). Baseline to 
EOT reductions in substance use occasions, depression, and anxiety 
significantly correlated with W-SUDs acceptability (r’s = (cid:0) .26 to (cid:0) .39, p

< .05). In-app thumbs up ratings correlated with CSQ-8 (r = .52, p < 
.001) and WAI-SR (r = .44, p < .001). URP-I feasibility correlated with 
days of W-SUDs app use (r = .27, p = .030) and the number of in-app text 
messages (r = .30, p = .015), mood ratings (r = .34, p = .007) and 
completed modules (r = .25, p = .048). 

In a randomized controlled trial conducted in summer 2020, during 
the COVID-19 pandemic, W-SUDs, a therapeutic relational agent, had 
decreased substance use occasions relative to a waitlist control group. 
Participants who reduced their substance use occasions from baseline to 
EOT reported increases in confidence to resist urges and fewer substance 
use problems, cravings, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and 
pandemic-related mental health effects. Hence, successfully reducing 
substance use, even if not achieving complete abstinence, was associated 
with fewer negative consequences and mental health concerns. 
Improvements observed in secondary substance use and mood out- 
comes did not differ by group. Prior studies of W-SUDs and Woebot have 
found significant treatment effects on mood (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017; 
Prochaska et al., 2021). Failure to replicate may relate to the sample’s 
lower depression and anxiety scores at baseline or may relate to 
pandemic-related transitions such as gradual reopening of services. A 
novel moment in time, pandemic-related secular trends are possibly 
anomalous and unpredictable making it challenging to generalize find- 
ings. Though changes in secondary outcomes did not differ significantly 
by group, changes in secondary outcomes were significantly associated 
with improvements in the primary outcome of substance use occasions. 
The W-SUDs app registration rate was 88%, better than our initial 
study (Prochaska et al., 2021) and comparable or better than other 
successful mobile health interventions (Cliffe et al., 2020). More par- 
ticipants used W-SUDs early in treatment; however, app activity 
remained high through 8 weeks and for many participants extended past 
8-weeks. W-SUDs improvements since our initial pilot include content 
refinement based on previous W-SUDs’ participant feedback and inte- 
gration of a refined app-onboarding process. Compared to our pilot, app 
use metrics in the current study nearly doubled and acceptability ratings 
increased on all measures. As found in our previous study, W-SUDs 
scored highest on the WAI-SR on affective bond formation, which is 
notable given that Woebot is expressly non-human. That the sum count 
of total in-app texts was weakly correlated with reduction in substance 
use occasions is consistent with acknowledgement in the digital health 
space of the need for promoting “effective engagement” rather than 
simply more engagement to achieve intended behavior change out- 
comes (Yardley et al., 2016). In the current study, reduction in substance 
use occasions was associated with W-SUDs treatment acceptability, 
feasibility, and satisfaction. 
Engagement in SUD treatment services during the study period did 
not predict reductions in substance use occasions; affect the strength of 
the treatment effect of W-SUDs; or correlate with measures of W-SUDs 
use, acceptability, feasibility, or satisfaction. W-SUDs appears useful and 
appropriate for adults with substance use concerns across the severity 
continuum. 
The current findings support the utility of AI applications for 
reflecting tailored empathy, at scale, and support and extend a growing 
body of literature on the use of conversational agents (or chatbots) to 
support behavioral health. A systematic review found that most online 
interventions targeting problematic substance use produced significant 
short-term improvement on at least one measure of problematic sub- 
stance use (Giroux et al., 2017). The current findings also contribute to 
research on digital health interventions for delivering mental health and 
substance use treatment to communities affected by natural disasters or 
other widespread stressors (Ruggiero et al., 2006, 2012; Strudwick et al., 
2021). 
Prior studies of digital therapeutics, including programs addressing 
substance misuse, have indicated lower participation among people 



without college degrees (Potdar et al., 2020; Ruggiero et al., 2006). Our 
finding of higher acceptability of W-SUDs among those with less edu- 
cation provides reassurance to concerns that digital therapeutics may 
increase health inequities (Azzopardi-Muscat and Sørensen, 2019) and 
reinforces the literature demonstrating that relational agents are 
approachable and usable for people with lower reading literacy (Bick- 
more and Gruber, 2010). In-hand digital therapeutics such as W-SUDs 
have utility for serving populations restricted in time, transportation, 
and financial resources for attending in-person treatment. Further, use 
of W-SUDs proved feasible and efficacious during a pandemic that called 
for physical distancing. Broader applications for reaching under-served 
populations post-pandemic are anticipated. 
Study strengths include the randomized design and low study 
dropout (i.e., missingness of outcome data). Analyses adjusted for 
baseline differences between conditions and predictors of attrition. 
Noncompliance, or crossover between conditions, was 11% overall; 
analyses followed randomization (i.e., intent-to-treat). The current 
study was limited to short-term outcomes, and the sample was pre- 
dominately female, identifying as non-Hispanic white, and employed 
full- or part-time pre-pandemic. Future research on W-SUDs will use a 
randomized design with an active comparator, with longer follow-up, 
and recruitment of a more diverse population using quotas to ensure 
racial/ethnic diversity in sampling. All data for this study were collected 
remotely and self-reported. Self-reported substance use can be subject to 
recall and social desirability bias; however, being virtual and not 
abstinence-only focused, the demand characteristics in the current study 
were low. The pre/post controlled design also mitigates concern about 
the influence of bias in reporting. The outcomes were standard self- 
report measures with demonstrated validity and reliability. Few par- 
ticipants were misusing opioids, likely due to study exclusion designed 
to mitigate risk (i.e., engagement with medication-assisted treatment, no 
history of opioid overdose requiring naloxone). Notably, over 1100 
people with interest in a program for those with substance use concerns 
were excluded due to low severity on the CAGE-AID screener. Worth 
testing is the utility of digital health programs for early intervention on 
the misuse of substances that is subsyndromal. 
In a randomized controlled trial evaluation, W-SUDs, a fully auto- 
mated therapeutic relational agent was efficacious in reducing substance 
use occasions, had high acceptability, and was feasible to access daily, 
even in the context (and sometimes confines) of a global pandemic. The 
current findings provide support for a digital therapeutic such as W- 
SUDs for addressing substance misuse.
