Elomia Chatbot: the Effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence in the 
Fight for Mental Health 


Abstract 
The article is presenting results of controlled study of effectiveness of Elomia chatbot in 
reducing tendency to depression, anxiety and negative emotional effects. Elomia was 
developed using artificial intelligence technologies. In the process of developing a chatbot 
following technologies were used: RoBERTa(NER) for identification names and locations; 
COSMIC for identification of human emotions; DIALOGPT for answers generation; 
DistilBERT (SQuAD) for pointing the most relevant information in the script; GECToR for 
spelling check. Elomia is able to identify the main psychological problems of the client and 
offer him the most suitable support option using first aid techniques and cognitive-behavioral 
psychotherapy. To check the effectiveness of the chatbot it was conducted a study that 
included three stages: 1) the formation of experimental and control samples; 2) baseline 
testing; 3) final testing. The study used psychological research methods: 1) Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to diagnose a tendency to depression; 2) General Anxiety Disorder- 
7 (GAD-7) to diagnose a tendency to generalized anxiety disorder; 3) Positive and Negative 
Affect Schedule (PANAS) to diagnose of prevailing (positive / negative) emotional affects. 
412 volunteers (202 women, 210 men, ages 19 to 23 years old) who identified their tendency 
to depression, anxiety and low mood were selected in students social networks groups of 
Kharkiv region as participants of research. It was found that regular usage of Elomia 
contributes to a significant reduction in the high tendency to depression (up to 28%), anxiety 
(up to 31%), and negative affects (up to 15%). 
Depressive and anxiety disorders spectrum include: F31 Bipolar disorder, F32 Major depressive 
disorder, F33 Recurrent depressive disorder, F41.1 Generalized Anxiety Disorder, F41.2 Mixed 
anxiety-depressive disorder and other anxiety disorders. All of these diagnoses can only be made by a 
psychiatrist and can be treated using a combination of psychotherapy and medication. According to

Depression and anxiety are the two most common disorders that seriously affect the quality of life 
of people of different age and social groups. The prevalence of anxiety and depression problems is 
evidenced by WHO data, as well as an increasing number of studies on this issue [1]. In recent years, 
scientists have revised the tools for diagnosing anxiety and depression [2, 3, 4], and ways to prevent 
and treat them [5, 6, 7], the influence of anxiety and depression on the quality of life of individual age 
and social groups [2, 8]. 
The consequences of depressive and anxious conditions are particularly painful for people who are 
going through age-related crises and experience reassessment of their own values and changes in self- 
image. 
 
 
 
 
the WHO, about 16% of all mental illnesses on the planet are caused by disorders of the anxiety- 
depressive spectrum. 
Moreover, hundreds of thousands of people around the world suffer from the so-called 
“precursors” of such disorders: increased levels of situational anxiety, low mood, anhedonia, feelings 
of loneliness, acute dissatisfaction with interpersonal relationships. People who suffer with these 
issues rarely seek help from psychotherapists, psychologists and counselors. They even tend to hide 
their emotional struggling from loved ones. Long-term attempts to cope with such experiences 
without outside help often have negative consequences for mental health, which results in the 
occurrence of disorders of the anxiety-depressive spectrum. 



In recent years, more and more psychological services aimed at providing psychological assistance 
online have occurred (Betterhelp, Helppoint, Talkspace, Youtalk, etc.). These services can be divided 
into 2 groups: 
“chatbots” which are based on active listening techniques 
online psychologists. 
 
 
Each of these groups has its advantages and disadvantages. So, the work of "chatbots" often does 
not imply an individual approach to the needs of the client and allows you to simply talk. Online 
psychologists, by contrast, provide expert assistance, but their work is quite expensive, which is an 
obstacle to the continued use of such a service for large group of potential clients. 
Awareness of the shortcomings of the existing models of online psychological assistance led to the 
creation of Elomia chatbot, in which the developers tried to combine the advantages of psychological 
online services: cheapness, round-the-clock availability and an individual approach to solving client 
problems.

Nowadays, artificial intelligence is widely used in medicine: 1) in the diagnosis of cancer through 
the analysis of MRI and ultrasound images; 2) to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease; 3) to 
find the optimal way of surgical intervention; 4) to build a course of treatment. This is just a short list 
of the areas in which the use of artificial intelligence can save lives today.Elomia is able to identify 
the main psychological problems of the client and offer him the most suitable support option using 
first aid techniques and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy.

 
exercises for calming; 
 
exercises for falling asleep; 


The study consisted of three stages: 
1. The formation of experimental and control samples; 
2. Baseline testing; 
3. Final testing. 
The study used psychological research methods: 1) Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to 
diagnose a tendency to depression; 2) General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to diagnose a tendency to 
generalized anxiety disorder; 3) Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) to diagnose of 
prevailing (positive / negative) emotional affects. 
The PHQ-9 questionnaire reveals a tendency to depression at 5 levels: minimal depression (1-4 
points), mild depression (5-9 points), moderate depression (10-14 points), moderately severe 
depression (15-19 points), severe depression (20-27 points) [9]. 






The research sample was formed in several steps. At the first step 412 volunteers (202 women, 210 
men, ages 19 to 23 years old) who identified their tendency to depression, anxiety and low mood were 
selected in students social networks groups of Kharkiv region. Another criterion for including 
respondents in the testing group was English proficiency at a B2 level (Upper Intermediate) and 
higher. After preliminary testing, 320 respondents (162 men and 158 women) who really showed a 
tendency to anxiety and depression according to testing were selected. At the second step, a group of 
82 respondents (39 women and 43 men) was randomly selected from 320 respondents. At the third 
step, the respondents were randomly divided into 2 groups: experimental (42 people) and control (40 
people). To check the distributions equality of respondents in groups by age and gender a chi square 
test was used (table 1).

The data in the table clearly show that the average indicator of depression in the experimental and 
control group corresponds to the indicators of tendency to moderate (10-14 points) depression; the 
average anxiety score corresponds to a tendency to a severe (15-21 points) level of anxiety; the 
average indicator of tendency to negative affects corresponds to a moderate level (20-40 points); the 
average indicator of the tendency to positive affects corresponds to a moderate level (20-40 points). 
A comparison was also made of the average indicators of the respondents of the two groups using 
the T-test for independent samples on the level of tendency to anxiety, depression and emotional 
affects (table 3).

After the completion of baseline testing, the respondents of the experimental group were given 
unlimited access to Elomia chatbot for 4 weeks. Respondents were instructed that they can use Elomia 
 
 
 
 
 
at any time of the day to the extent that they need. Thus, each participant in the study had the 
opportunity to control the amount of communication with Elomia, depending on their needs. 
Respondents in the control group were asked to use the Depression self-help guide developed by 
The National Health Service of the United Kingdom to correct negative emotional states [12]. This 
guide also contains a set of cognitive-behavioral techniques that help to deal with non-adaptive 
thoughts and to reduce anxiety and depression. Respondents were instructed that they can contact the 
guide at any time when they feel the need for it without restrictions. 



etesting was performed in study groups 4 weeks after the baseline. To identify changes in the 
level of anxiety and depression in the study groups the T-test for paired samples was conducted 
separately in the experimental (table 4) and control (table 5) study groups.

T-test showed significant differences in all study indicators. This means that users of Elomia after 
4 weeks of its usage noted a significant decrease in the symptom of anxiety, depression and negative 
affects. Moreover, there is an increase in positive affects, which manifests itself in a more calm, 
balanced state, high self-esteem, confidence in the future. 
The participants in the experimental group noted that after using Elomia, they became calmer, 
more self-confident. Many noted that they have become less likely to experience aggression towards 
others, fear, sense of hopelessness. More than 70% of the participants noted that they returned to 
using the chatbot in moments of increased anxiety, panic attack, self-doubt, loneliness.

Comparison of the average indicators of depression tendency in the experimental and control 
groups allows us to evaluate the effect of the work of respondents with Elomia chatbot. So, after 4 
weeks of using the chatbot the average indicator of depression tendency moved from the “Moderate 
Depression” zone to the “Mild Depression” zone, while in the control group it remained at the same 
level. 
The main reason for such results is that Elomia does not immerse the client in dull and lonely 
thoughts. On the contrary, it creates the conditions for self-disclosure of the person, gives the 
opportunity to speak out. In addition, the techniques presented in the application allow a person with 
depressive tendencies to reduce stress levels and feel a positive attitude towards themselves. 
he average indicator of tendency to anxiety in the experimental group moved from a zone of 
severe to a zone of moderate anxiety. In the control group the anxiety rate remained as high as during 
the baseline testing. 
These results are associated with the systematic use of grounding techniques that AI offers to 
anxious clients. While in a state of anxiety, a person often becomes obsessed with unproductive 
experiences and thoughts that prevent him from finding contact with a calming reality. Grounding 
techniques allow a person to return to reality through simple, repetitive actions (drawing, creating 
shapes with simple objects). Elomia allows clients to use these techniques on their own in times of 
anxiety or fear. 






















 
 
 




The participants in the experimental group, after using the chatbot, stopped experiencing fear, 
nervousness, shame and distress as the leading emotions. In addition, there was a decrease in 
emotions such as irritability, guilt and hostility. Respondents noted that a decrease in negative 
experiences led to better relationships with family and friends, which in turn created an additional 
circle of psychological support around them. Thus, the use of the chatbot contributed not only to the 
reduction of negative feelings directed by a person towards himself, but also the manifestation of 
negative emotions directed to others.

During the final interview, the respondents who used the chatbot noted that during communication 
they became more self-confident, started to understand life problems differently, began to think about 
how they live, felt “the ground under their feet”. 
As the most significant change, participants noted the change in the outlook on the world around 
them as more positive, friendly and filled with resources. Having received support from the chatbot, 
the participants realized that it was not a shame to ask for help and it was absolutely normal, which 
took their thinking out of a dead corner. 
Respondents in the control group also noted the usefulness of the depression self-help guide. But 
they also pointed out that in the process of reading the manual they had questions and ideas that they 
had no one to discuss with, and attempts to introduce changes into their lives without outside support 
came up against resistance from relatives. The inability to bring changes to life reduced the 
motivation to re-visit the guide and increased the overall level of frustration and self-discontent. 

Regular usage of Elomia contributes to a significant reduction in the high tendency to depression 
(up to 28%), anxiety (up to 31%), and negative affects (up to 15%). This reduction is achieved 
through the use of "conversational therapy" with elements of cognitive-behavioral techniques. At the 
same time usage of such techniques without a conversational elements does not lead to significant 
changes in the emotional state of clients within the indicated time frames. 
Elomia is a powerful tool for providing first aid to people suffering from anxiety and depression. 
Its systematic use can reduce the level of negative affects. It is important to note that it cannot act as a 
full-fledged substitute for psychotherapy or medical treatment for depression. Rather, it reduces the 
chances of the person using it to experience serious mental illness.
