Background: Misuse of substances is common, can be serious and costly to society, and often goes untreated due to barriers 
to accessing care. Woebot is a mental health digital solution informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and built upon an artificial 
intelligence–driven platform to deliver tailored content to users. In a previous 2-week randomized controlled trial, Woebot 
alleviated depressive symptoms. 
Objective: This study aims to adapt Woebot for the treatment of substance use disorders (W-SUDs) and examine its feasibility, 
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. 
Methods: American adults (aged 18-65 years) who screened positive for substance misuse without major health contraindications 
were recruited from online sources and flyers and enrolled between March 27 and May 6, 2020. In a single-group pre/postdesign, 
all participants received W-SUDs for 8 weeks. W-SUDs provided mood, craving, and pain tracking and modules (psychoeducational 
lessons and psychotherapeutic tools) using elements of dialectical behavior therapy and motivational interviewing. Paired samples 
t tests and McNemar nonparametric tests were used to examine within-subject changes from pre- to posttreatment on measures 
of substance use, confidence, cravings, mood, and pain. 
Results: The sample (N=101) had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD 10.0), and 75.2% (76/101) of the participants were female, 
78.2% (79/101) were non-Hispanic White, and 72.3% (73/101) were employed. Participants’ W-SUDs use averaged 15.7 (SD 
14.2) days, 12.1 (SD 8.3) modules, and 600.7 (SD 556.5) sent messages. About 94% (562/598) of all completed psychoeducational 
lessons were rated positively. From treatment start to end, in-app craving ratings were reduced by half (87/101, 86.1% reporting 
cravings in the app; odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.32-0.73). Posttreatment assessment completion was 50.5% (51/101), with better 
retention among those who initially screened higher on substance misuse. From pre- to posttreatment, confidence to resist urges 
to use substances significantly increased (mean score change +16.9, SD 21.4; P<.001), whereas past month substance use occasions 
(mean change −9.3, SD 14.1; P<.001) and scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (mean change −1.3, 
SD 2.6; P<.001), 10-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (mean change −1.2, SD 2.0; P<.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item 
(mean change 2.1, SD 5.2; P=.005), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (mean change −2.3, SD 4.7; P=.001), and cravings scale 
(68.6% vs 47.1% moderate to extreme; P=.01) significantly decreased. Most participants would recommend W-SUDs to a friend 
(39/51, 76%) and reported receiving the service they desired (41/51, 80%). Fewer felt W-SUDs met most or all of their needs 
(22/51, 43%).

Conclusions: W-SUDs was feasible to deliver, engaging, and acceptable and was associated with significant improvements in 
substance use, confidence, cravings, depression, and anxiety. Study attrition was high. Future research will evaluate W-SUDs in 
a randomized controlled trial with a more diverse sample and with the use of greater study retention strategies.

Misuse of substances is common, can be serious and costly to 
society, and often goes untreated due to barriers to accessing 
care. Globally, 3.5 million people die from alcohol and illicit 
drug use each year [1]. The disease burden of alcohol and illicit 
drug addiction is the highest in the United States [2]. Over 20 
million Americans (aged 12 years and older) had a substance 
use disorder (SUD) in 2018, 73% had an alcohol use disorder, 
40% had an illicit drug use disorder, and 13% had both alcohol 
and illicit drug use disorders [3]. Approximately half (47%) of 
Americans with an SUD had a co-occurring mental illness. 
Treatment of depression and anxiety, the most common 
psychiatric comorbidities among patients with SUDs, may 
reduce craving and substance use and enhance overall outcomes 
[4]. 
In 2018, less than 1 in 5 individuals with a SUD received 
addiction treatment [3]. Alcohol and illicit drug misuse and 
addiction cost the United States over US $440 billion annually 
in lost workplace productivity, health care expenses, and 
crime-related costs [5]. Potential effects on individuals include 
an array of physical and mental health problems, overdose, 
trauma, and violence [5]. 
Web-based interventions and digital health apps may reduce or 
eliminate common, significant barriers to traditional SUD 
treatment (eg, stigma; financial, time, and transportation 
constraints; lack of access to qualified providers; challenges 
navigating complex treatment systems; and low perceived 
utility) [6]. Preliminary evidence suggests that digital SUD 
interventions affect substance use behavior [6,7] and have the 
potential to reduce the population burden of SUDs. To date, 
most digital SUD interventions have been delivered on a web 
platform, rather than via mobile apps. The widespread use of 
smartphones makes app-based intervention delivery a viable 
and scalable medium. In 2019, about 8 out of 10 White, Black, 
and Latinx adults owned a smartphone [8]. Although 
lower-income adults were less likely to own a smartphone than 
higher-income adults, they were more likely to rely on 
smartphones for internet access [9]. In a 2015 survey, 58% of 
mobile phone owners reported downloading a health app [10]. 
Texting is the most widely and frequently used app on a 
smartphone, with 97% of Americans texting at least once a day 
[11]. 
Automated conversational agents can deliver a coach-like or 
sponsor-like experience and yet do not require human 
implementation assistance for in-the-moment treatment delivery.

As recent meta-analytic work suggests, conversational text-based 
agents may increase engagement and enjoyment in digitized 
mental health care [12], whereas most general mental health 
care apps face difficulty sustaining engagement with high 
dropout [13,14]. Conversational agents can provide real-time 
support to address substance use urges, unlike traditional 
in-person frameworks of weekly visits. The scale potential of 
conversational agents is unconstrained, immediate, and available 
to users in an instant [12]. Being nonhuman based also reduces 
perceived stigma. A study found that people were significantly 
more likely to disclose personal information to artificial 
intelligence when they believed it was computer- rather than 
human-monitored [15]. Users can develop a strong therapeutic 
alliance in the absence of face-to-face contact [16], even with 
a nonhuman app [17]. Digital environments can promote honest 
disclosure due to greater ease of processing thoughts [16] and 
reduced risk of embarrassment [17]. Finally, although 
conversational agents can present in different modalities, 
text, verbal [18,19], and animation [20-25], 
including 
preliminary research on modality for psychoeducation delivery 
specifically found that text-based presentation resulted in higher 
program adherence than verbal presentation [26]. 
Evidence for conversational agent interventions for addressing 
mental health problems is growing quickly and appears 
promising with regard to acceptability and efficacy [27]. 
Developed as a mental health digital app, Woebot is a text-based 
conversational agent available to check in with users whenever 
they have smartphone access. Using conversational tones, 
Woebot is designed to encourage mood tracking and to deliver 
general psychoeducation as well as tailored empathy, cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT)–based behavior change tools, and 
behavioral pattern insight. Among a sample of adults (N=70) 
randomly assigned to Woebot or an information only control 
group, Woebot users had statistically and clinically significant 
reductions in depressive symptoms (F1,48=6.03; P=.02) after 2 
weeks of use, whereas those in the control group did not. 
Engagement with the app was high (averaging 12 interactions 
within 14 days) [18]. 
However, the efficacy of conversational agents for treating 
SUDs remains unknown. Woebot’s app-based platform and 
user-centered design philosophy make it a promising modality 
for SUD treatment delivery; it offers immediate, evidence-based 
tailored support in the peak moment of craving. An informal 
poll of Woebot users (in July 2018) indicated that 63% had 
interest in content addressing SUDs; 22% of surveyed users 
reported having 5 or more alcoholic drinks in a row within a

(page number not for citation purposes) 


couple of hours (ie, binge use) [28], and 5% endorsed using 
nonprescription drugs. 
Although the efficacy of automated conversational agent digital 
therapeutics for SUDs is still untested, such products are 
commercially available, and few consumers are aware that the 
products lack evidence [29]. This study aims to adapt the 
original Woebot for the treatment of SUDs (W-SUDs), and test 
the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in a 
single-group pre-/posttreatment design. 

Study Design 
In a single-group design, we examined within-subject changes 
in self-reported substance use behavior, cravings, confidence 
to resist urges to use substances, mood symptoms (depression, 
anxiety), and pain from pre- to posttreatment. Intervention 
engagement data were collected from the Woebot app during 
the 8-week treatment period. Acceptability ratings were 
collected within the app and within the posttreatment survey. 
The study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of Stanford Medicine. 
Sample Recruitment 
Participants were recruited via the Woebot app, social media 
(eg, Facebook and Nextdoor), Craigslist, and Stanford staff and 
student wellness listservs. In addition, study flyers were posted 
in the San Francisco Bay Area, and email invitations were sent 
to participants from previous studies. Recruitment materials 
included the URL on a webpage describing the study for people 
with substance use concerns. Informed consent was required to 
screen for eligibility. Those who screened as eligible were asked 
to provide informed consent for participation in the study. 
Inclusion criteria were all genders, aged 18 years to 65 years, 
residing in the United States, screening positive on the 4-item 
Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye opener-Adapted to Include 
Drugs (CAGE-AID) [30] (ie, score of 2 or higher), owning a 
smartphone for accessing Woebot, available for the 8-week 
study, willing to provide an email address, and English literate. 
The CAGE-AID has demonstrated validity, with high internal 
consistency in screening for problematic drug and alcohol use; 
a cutoff point of 2+ on the CAGE-AID has a sensitivity of 70% 
and specificity of 85% for identifying individuals with SUDs 
[30]. Study exclusion criteria were current pregnancy, history 
of severe alcohol or drug-related medical problems (eg, delirium 
tremens, seizure, liver disease, and hallucinations), opioid 
overdose requiring Narcan (naloxone), current opioid misuse 
without medication-assisted treatment, or attempted suicide 
within the past year. 
For this study, the target sample size was 50 participants; 
however, due to a high level of response and efficiency, 
enrollment was more than double our recruitment goal. Between 
March 27, 2020 and May 6, 2020, 3597 individuals were 
screened for study participation, with 3422 ineligible and 175 
eligible individuals. Figure 1 shows the reasons for study 
exclusion, most frequently residing outside of the United States 
(2566/3433, 74.75%) and endorsing fewer than 2 criteria on the 
CAGE-AID (1397/3433, 40.69%). Of the 175 eligible 
participants, 141 provided informed consent to participate in 
the study, of whom 128 completed the baseline survey. The 
analytic sample consisted of 101 participants who ultimately 
registered with W-SUDs and initiated use. Among the 101 
participants enrolled, 11 (10.9%) reported previous use of the 
Woebot app.

Procedures 
Those who provided informed consent and enrolled were asked 
to use W-SUDs for 8 weeks. Assessments were administered 
via Qualtrics at the beginning and end of the 8-week treatment 
period. Participants received a US $25 Amazon gift card at the 
end of the study for completing the posttreatment assessment. 
W-SUDs Intervention 
Described in detail previously [18], Woebot is an automated 
conversational agent that delivers CBT in the format of brief, 
daily text-based conversations. The Woebot program is deployed 
through its own native apps on both iPhone and Android 
smartphones or devices. The app onboarding process introduces 
the automated conversational agent, explains the intended use 
of the device, how data are treated, and the limitations of the 
service (eg, it is not a crisis service). The user experience is 
centered around mood tracking and goal-oriented, tailored 
conversations that can, depending on user input and choice, 
focus on CBT psychoeducation, application of psychotherapeutic 
skills for change (eg, thought-challenging), mindfulness 


exercises, gratitude journaling, and/or reflecting upon patterns 
and lessons already covered. Each interaction begins with a 
general inquiry about context (eg, “What’s going on in your 
world right now?”) and mood (eg, “How are you feeling?”) to 
ascertain affect 
therapeutic 
process-oriented features of Woebot include delivery of 
empathic responses with tailoring to users’ stated mood(s), goal 
setting with regular check-ins for maintaining accountability, 
a focus on motivation and engagement, and individualized 
weekly reports to foster reflection. Users become familiar with 
Woebot, which is a friendly, helpful character that is explicitly 
not a human or a therapist but rather a guided self-help coach. 
Daily push notifications prompt users to check in. 
We adapted W-SUDs, drawing upon motivational interviewing 
principles, mindfulness training, dialectical behavior therapy, 
and CBT for relapse prevention. Sample screenshots from the 
W-SUDs app are shown in Figure 2. In total, the W-SUDs 
intervention was developed as an 8-week program with tracking 
of mood, substance use craving, and pain, with over 50 
psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapeutic skills. 
Figure 2. Sample screenshots of the Woebot for substance use disorders app: a psychoeducational lesson called Misinformation, the core conversational 
panel (featuring the Lesson Misinformation), and psychotherapeutic skills for behavior change and mood tracking. 
CBT evidence-based, guided self-help treatments have ranged 
in length from 2 to 12 weeks [31-34], and the National Institutes 
for Clinical Excellence describes guided self-help as including 
6 to 8 face-to-face sessions [35]. Early responsiveness to SUD 
treatment is predictive of long-term outcomes [36], and brief 
addiction treatments are efficacious [37]. Brief intervention can 
minimize potential dropout, a problem common to SUD 
treatment; [38] therefore, we designed W-SUDs as an 8-week 
treatment. 
Woebot is not designed to address active suicidal ideation or 
overdose, and this was stated in the study informed consent. In 
addition, Woebot conversationally informs first-time users that 
it is not a crisis service. Woebot also has safety net detection 
that uses natural language processing algorithms to detect and 
flag several hundred possible harm-to-self phrases (including 
some misspellings and slang phrases) with 98% accuracy 
(sensitivity=97 and specificity=99; Woebot Health, unpublished 
data, September 2020). Woebot detects crisis language (eg, 
“want to cut myself”) and asks to confirm it with the user. If 
the user confirms, Woebot offers resources (eg, 9-1-1, suicide 
crisis hotlines), carefully curated with expert consultation. 
Woebot data indicate that users do not use Woebot for crisis 
management; approximately 6.3% trigger the safety net protocol, 
with 27% of those confirming that it is indeed a crisis when 
Woebot asks to confirm (ie, the true positive rate). 
Assessments 
Demographic items were assessed at pretreatment; substance 
use, mental health, and pain measures were administered at pre- 
and posttreatment; serious adverse events and W-SUDs 
feasibility and acceptability were assessed at posttreatment; and

(page number not for citation purposes) 


W-SUDs use data were collected via the Woebot app over the 
8-week intervention. Demographic items included self-reported 
sex, race and ethnicity, age, marital status, employment status, 
residential zip code, and sheltering-in-place status given the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise 
(AUDIT-C), a widely used 3-item self-report measure based on 
the 10-item original AUDIT [39], assessed hazardous or harmful 
alcohol consumption in the past 3 months. A score of 4+ for 
men and 3+ for women indicated significant problems with 
alcohol consumption. The AUDIT-C has been found to be a 
valid screening test for heavy drinking and/or active alcohol 
abuse or dependence [39]. The Drug Abuse Screening Test-10 
(DAST-10), a 10-item self-report measure adapted from the 
28-item DAST [40], assessed consequences related to drug 
abuse, excluding alcohol and tobacco in the past 3 months. The 
last item of the DAST-10 regarding medical problems resulting 
from drug use was not reassessed because it was an exclusion 
criterion in the study screener; hence, the total possible range 
for the sample was 0-9, not 0-10. Total scores of 3+ indicated 
significant problems related to drug abuse. The DAST-10 has 
moderate test-retest reliability, sensitivity, and specificity [40]. 
For the AUDIT-C and DAST-10 measures at posttreatment, the 
reference period was the past 2 months, to reflect the period of 
intervention. Craving was assessed with a single item asking, 
“In the past 7 days, how much were you bothered by cravings 
or urges to drink alcohol or use drugs?”, with response options 
of not at all (0), a little bit (1), moderately (2), quite a bit (3), 
and extremely 
(4). The Brief Situational Confidence 
Questionnaire [41], a state-dependent measure, assessed 
self-confidence to resist the urge “right now” to drink heavily 
(self-defined) or use drugs in different situations reported on 
visual analog scales (100 mm lines) anchored from 0% “not at 
all confident” to 100% “totally confident.” 
The Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item (PHQ-8), an 8-item 
scale, assessed depressive symptoms [42], and the Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder-7 item (GAD-7), a 7-item scale, assessed 
symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder [43]. Both the PHQ-8 
and GAD-7 have good internal consistency and demonstrated 
convergent validity with measures of depression, stress, and 
anxiety. A total of 2 items assessed the history of therapy (ever 
and current) for mental health or substance use concerns. 
Lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were assessed using 10 items 
plus a write-in option for others. A single item assessed currently 
taking prescribed medications for a psychiatric diagnosis.

Acceptability (6 items) scales [44], the 8-item Client Satisfaction 
Questionnaire-8 questions (CSQ-8) [45], and the 12-item 
Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) [46]. 
The URP-I item response options ranged from strongly disagree 
to strongly agree; the items were summed for a total score within 
each scale, with one feasibility item reverse coded. The CSQ-8 
items have 4-point rating scales with response descriptors that 
vary. Internal consistency exceeds 0.90, and the total sum score 
ranges from 8 to 32, with higher total scores indicating higher 
satisfaction. The WAI-SR has three 4-item subscales, with 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
5-point rating scales, that reflect development of an affective 
bond in treatment and level of agreement with treatment goals 
and treatment tasks. Serious adverse events occurring in the 8 
weeks after the start of the study were assessed for 
hospitalization related to substance use, suicide attempt, alcohol 
or drug overdose, and severe withdrawal (eg, delirium tremens). 
Positive endorsements were followed up with questions about 
the timing, diagnosis, and resolution. If additional details were 
needed to determine whether the event was study related, a team 
member reached out to the participant. Serious adverse events 
were reported to the study’s Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) within 72 hours of the team learning of the event. 
Participants’ W-SUDs app use, including days of app use, 
number of check-ins, and number of messages sent, was 
collected via the Woebot app, as were module completion rates, 
lesson acceptability ratings indicated on a binary scale (ie, a 
thumbs up or thumbs down emoticon), and mood impact after 
tools utilization (ie, feeling same, better, or worse after 
completion). In addition, on a daily basis, the W-SUDs app 
assessed mood, cravings or urges 
to use, and pain. 
In-the-moment emotional state was reported through emoji 
selection with a default menu of 19 total moods, including 
options for negative (angry, sad, and anxious), positive (happy 
and content), and average mood (okay), with an additional 
ability to type in free text emotion words and/or self-selected 
emoji expressions. Cravings were assessed as not at all (0), a 
little bit (1), moderately (2), quite a bit (3), or extremely (4). 
Physical pain was rated on a scale of 0 to 10. 
Data Analyses 
Descriptive statistics (means and frequencies) were used to 
describe the sample and examine the ratings of program 
feasibility and acceptability. Paired samples t tests and McNemar 
nonparametric tests examined within-subject changes from pre- 
to posttreatment on measures of substance use, confidence, 
cravings, mood, and pain. Change scores were calculated (pre- 
minus posttreatment), and bivariate correlations were used to 
examine associations between changes in AUDIT-C and 
DAST-10 scores and changes in use occasions, confidence, and 
depression and anxiety scores. t tests were conducted to examine 
changes from pre- to posttreatment in substance use, confidence, 
mood, and pain by whether participants were currently in 
therapy or taking psychiatric medications. Posttreatment survey 
completion was 50.5% (51/101), with better retention among 
those with a higher CAGE-AID score at screening (γ=0.37; 
P=.02). Retention was lowest among those with a CAGE-AID 
score of 2 (7/26, 27%) and higher for those scoring 3 (22/38, 
58%) or 4 (22/37, 59%). Retention was unrelated to participant 
demographic characteristics, previous use of Woebot, psychiatric 
diagnoses, primary problematic substance, depressive symptoms, 
pain, cravings, confidence, substance use occasions, AUDIT-C 
scores, or DAST-10 scores (all P values>.102). Missing data 
on individual survey items was minimal. In a single instance, 
a participant’s average score values were imputed when missing 
1 item on the PHQ-8. Participants were prompted to report 
craving and pain ratings within the W-SUDs app on a daily 
basis. The data were aggregated so that if participants provided 
multiple ratings within a day, the scores were averaged. To 
examine changes over time, generalized estimating equation

(page number not for citation purposes) 


linear models were run with week entered as a factor, setting 
week 1 as the reference category. 

Sample Characteristics 
Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the participants. 
According to zip code, the sample was drawn from 31 US states, 
and at baseline, nearly all participants (99/101, 98.0%) reported 
sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most 
(73/101, 72.3%) reported a lifetime psychiatric diagnosis, most 
commonly generalized anxiety disorder (49/101, 48.5%) and 
unipolar depression (45/101, 44.6%), with 47.5% (48/101) 
reporting multiple lifetime psychiatric diagnoses; few (6/101, 
5.9%) reported a SUD diagnosis, 43.6% (44/101) were currently 
taking psychiatric medication, and 25.7% (26/101) were 
currently in therapy.

bSix participants reported no substance use in the past 30 days at baseline. The mean days of use were calculated among those who reported any use of 
that substance in the past 30 days. 
cValues presented are percentages. 
Substance Use at Pretreatment 
Self-identified primary problematic substances were alcohol 
(69/101, 68.3%), cannabis (20/101, 19.8%), stimulants or 
cocaine (7/101, 6.9%), and other (5/101, 4.9%). Over a third 
(37/101, 36.6%) indicated problems with multiple substances. 
Most (88/101, 87.1%) reported use of alcohol in the past month; 
among past month drinkers, alcohol use averaged 19.4 of the 
past 30 days. About half (50/101, 49.5%) reported use of 
cannabis in the past month, among users averaging 19.4 of the 
past 30 days. Less common was use of sedatives (19/101, 
18.8%), hallucinogens (10/101, 9.9%), and prescription 
stimulants (10/101, 9.9%) in the past month. None of the 
participants reported use of street opioids in the past month. 
Combining reported days of use across substances, the number 
of use occasions in the past 30 days averaged 31.8 (SD 17.7) 
with a wide range of 0-76. At baseline, AUDIT-C scores 
averaged 5.5 (SD 3.1) for the overall sample, with 72% (18/25) 
of men and 78% (59/76) of women scoring in the clinical range. 
DAST-10 scores averaged 3.0 (SD 2.6), with 55.4% (56/101) 
scoring in the clinical range. Nearly two-thirds (63/101, 62.4%) 
of the sample reported being bothered in the past 7 days by 
moderate-to-extreme cravings or urges to drink alcohol or use 
drugs. Participants’ confidence in 8 domains to resist urges to 
use substances ranged from an average of 60.5% (SD 31.7) for 
positive emotional states to 38.5% (SD 30.1) for negative 
emotional states, with an overall average of 48.1% (SD 22.1) 
and a wide range of 1%-100%. 
W-SUDs Use and Within-App User Feedback 
Among the full sample (N=101), for the 8-week treatment 
period, participants’ use of W-SUDs averaged 15.7 days (SD

of 600.7 user sent messages (SD 556.5; median 360; IQR 763) 
or 75.1 messages per week and engagement on average with 
12.1 modules (SD 8.3; median 9; IQR 12.5), which consist of 
psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapeutic tools for mood 
and behavior change. An indicator of intervention engagement 
over time, Multimedia Appendix 1 shows the percentage of 
participants actively sending messages by treatment week and, 
among those participating each week, their average number of 
messages. The types of conversations vary in length; therefore, 
the total number of messages sent does not necessarily reflect 
the richness of content reviewed. In addition, the individuals in 
each week are not necessarily the same across weeks. For 
example, someone could have sent messages in weeks 2 to 4 
and 6 to 7 but not in weeks 5 or 8. The sample completed an 
average of 7.9 psychoeducational lessons (SD 7.6; median 4; 
IQR 12). Lesson completion rates were highest (>50%) for 
content concerning COVID-19, urge surfing, and SUD labels 
and lowest (<5%) for content concerning sleep and grief. Lesson 
acceptability ratings were high across the board, with 94.0% 
thumbs up. 
(562/598) of completed 
Participants used an average of 4.3 tools (SD 1.4; median 4; 
IQR 1). Mood impact after tool utilization, denoting in-vivo 
mood modulation, was predominately positive (better=70%, 
same=24%, and worse=6%). In total, 14 of the 101 users 
(13.9%) completed all of the psychoeducational lessons in 
W-SUDs before the end of the 8-week intervention period. 

W-SUDs Mood, Craving, and Pain Ratings 
A total of 1571 mood ratings were entered into the W-SUDs 
app by 90 of the 101 (89.1%) participants, with each participant 
entering on average 17.5 mood ratings (SD 16.1; median 10; 
IQR 25.3) or 2.2 per week. A total of 1399 craving and 1403 
pain ratings were entered into the W-SUDs app by 87 of the 
101 participants (86.1%), with each participant providing an 
average of 16.1 ratings (SD 14.8; median 9; IQR 21) for cravings 
and 16.1 ratings (SD 14.9; median 9; IQR 21) for pain. Table 
2 shows the number of participants providing craving ratings 
for each week and summarizes the generalized estimating 
equation model analyzing craving ratings over time. Compared 
with week 1, craving ratings were significantly lower at weeks 
4 through 9. By weeks 8 and 9, craving ratings were reduced 
by approximately half of the sample’s mean rating at week 1. 
In contrast, pain ratings did not differ significantly by week and 
over the 9 weeks averaged 2.3 (SD 2.1), on a scale of 0 to 10.

Changes Pre- to Posttreatment 
Table 3 shows scores for the participants who completed 
assessments at both pre- and posttreatment. In paired sample t 
tests, confidence scores overall and in all 8 domains significantly 
increased from pre- to posttreatment (all P values<.05). In 
addition, significant reductions were observed from pre- to 
posttreatment in past month substance use occasions, AUDIT-C 
and DAST-10 scores (overall and among those in the clinical 
range at pretreatment), and PHQ-8 depression and GAD-7 
anxiety scores (all P values<.05). A McNemar test indicated 
significant reductions in cravings, with more participants 
reporting 
reporting 
to no cravings and 
moderate-to-extreme cravings from pre- to posttreatment 
(P<.001). Reports of pain intensity and pain interference with 
work did not change significantly from pre- to posttreatment. 


A greater decline in the AUDIT-C score was associated with 
greater reductions in use occasions (r=0.48), PHQ-8 depression 
(r=0.36), and GAD-7 anxiety (r=0.34) scores and with increases 
in confidence (r=−0.39; all P values<.02). A greater decline in 
the DAST-10 score was associated with greater reductions in 
PHQ-8 depression (r=0.40; P<.01) but not with the number of 
use occasions (r=0.10), confidence (r=−0.12), or GAD-7 anxiety 
(r=0.21). 


Of the 14 t tests, only 1 was statistically significant as to whether 
participants currently 
taking psychiatric 
medications showed greater pre- to posttreatment changes in 
substance use (use occasions, AUDIT-C, and DAST-10), 
confidence, mood (PHQ-8 and GAD-7), or pain. The finding 
was that participants currently in therapy reported greater 
reductions from pre- to posttreatment in depressive symptoms 
(n=16; mean change −4.7, SD 4.5) than those not currently in 
therapy (n=35; mean change −0.9, SD 5.1; t49=2.55; P=.01).

Serious Adverse Events 
Among the 51 participants who completed the posttreatment

switching from smoking to injecting illicit drugs, shortly before 
or at the start of study participation, and was deemed by the 
DSMB to be unrelated to study involvement. 
Feasibility and Acceptability Ratings 
Table 4 shows the mean scores and ranges of the 4 feasibility 
and acceptability measures completed posttreatment. On the 
individual CSQ-8 items, the majority (35/51, 69%) indicated 
that they would return to the program, reported that interactions 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
with W-SUDs helped them deal more effectively with their 
problems (35/51, 69%), were mostly or very satisfied overall 
(36/51, 71%), were satisfied with the amount of help received 
(37/51, 73%), rated the quality of interaction on W-SUDs as 
good or excellent (39/51, 76%), would recommend W-SUDs 
to a friend (39/51, 76%), and received the kind of service they 
wanted (41/51, 80%). A lower percentage of participants stated 
that W-SUDs met most or all of their needs (22/51, 43%). Scores 
for the 3 WAI-SR subscales, with identical response options, 
test 
differed significantly from each other in pairwise t 
comparisons (all P values<.05), with the highest ratings on 
development of an affective bond to Woebot, followed by 
agreement on the tasks of treatment and then agreement on the 
goals of treatment.

CSQ-8 satisfaction scores did not differ by any measured 
participant characteristics, including sex, race or ethnicity, 
marital and employment status, age, primary substance of abuse, 
or history of a psychiatric diagnosis. CSQ-8 satisfaction scores 
also did not differ by baseline measures of depression, anxiety, 
pain, craving, confidence, substance use occasions, AUDIT-C, 
or DAST-10 scores. Non-Hispanic White participants had higher 
URP-I-Acceptability ratings (F1,50=8.32; P=.006) and higher 
WAI-SR scores (F1,50=5.08; P=.03) than participants from other 
racial or ethnic groups. In addition, URP-I-Acceptability ratings 
were 
reported 
moderate-to-extreme craving at baseline (F1,50=5.21; P=.03). 
Finally, older age 
reporting of 
moderate-to-extreme impairment due to pain at baseline 
(F1,50=4.36; P=.04) were 
higher 
URP-I-Feasibility ratings. 





A greater reduction in substance use occasions from pre- to 
posttreatment was significantly associated with higher WAI-SR 
(r=−0.37; P=.008) and URP-I-Acceptability (r=−0.30; P=.03) 
scores. An increase in confidence to resist urges to use 
substances was also associated with higher scores on the 
WAI-SR (r=0.30; P=.03), URP-I-Acceptability (r=0.33; P=.02), 
and CSQ-8 (r=0.28; P=.045). Changes in AUDIT-C, DAST-10, 
depression, and anxiety measures were not associated with 
acceptability and feasibility ratings. 

Principal Findings 
W-SUDs, an automated conversational agent, was feasible to 
deliver, engaging, and acceptable and was associated with 
significant improvements pre- to posttreatment in self-reported 
measures of substance use, confidence, craving, depression, and 
anxiety and in-app measures of craving. The W-SUDs app 
registration rate among those who completed the baseline survey 
was 78.9% (101/128), comparable with other successful mobile 
health interventions [47]. As expected, the use of the W-SUDs 
app was highest early in treatment and declined over the 8 
weeks. Study of engagement with digital health apps has been 
growing, with no consensus yet on ideal construct definitions 
[48-50]. Simply reporting the number of messages or minutes 
spent on an app over time may undermine clarity and genuine 
understanding of the type and manifestation of app utilization

related to clinical outcomes of interest [51]. Further research in 
this area is warranted. 
The observed reductions from pre- to posttreatment measures 
of depression and anxiety symptoms were consistent with a 
previous evaluation of Woebot conducted with college students 
self-identified as having symptoms of anxiety and depression 
[18]. Furthermore, in this study, treatment-related reductions 
in depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with 
declines in problematic substance use. Declines in depressive 
symptoms observed from pre- to posttreatment were greater 
among the participants in therapy. 
This study also examined working alliance, proposed to mediate 
clinical outcomes in traditional therapeutic settings [52]. 
Traditionally, working alliance has been characterized as the 
cooperation and collaboration in the therapeutic relationship 
between the patient and the therapist [53-55]. The role of 
working alliance in relationally based systems and digital 
therapeutics has been previously considered [16,17,56]; the 
potential of alliance to mediate outcomes in Woebot should be 
further validated in future studies adequately powered to 
examine mediators of change. 
Measures of physical pain did not change with the use of 
W-SUDs as reported in pre- and posttreatment measures or 
within the app; however, the sample’s baseline ratings of pain 
intensity and pain interference were low. Although not a direct 
intervention target, pain was measured due to the potential for 
use of substances to self-treat physical pain and the possibility 
that pain may worsen if substance use was reduced, which was 
not observed here. 
Within-app lesson completion and content acceptability were 
high for the overall sample, although there was a wide range of 
use patterns. Most participants used all facets of the W-SUDs 
app: tracked their mood, cravings, and pain; completed on 
average over 7 psychoeducational lessons; and used tools in the 
W-SUDs app. Only about half of the sample completed the 
posttreatment assessment, with better retention among those 
screening higher on the CAGE-AID. That is, those with more 
severe substance use problems at the start of the study, and 
hence in greater need of the intervention, were more likely to 
complete the posttreatment evaluation. None of the other 
measured variables distinguished those who did and did not 
complete the posttreatment evaluation. This level of attrition is 
J Med Internet Res 2021 | vol. 23 | iss. 3 | e24850 | p. 12 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


commensurate with other digital mental health solution trial 
attrition rates [47,57]. 
Comparison With Previous Work 
By addressing problematic substance use, including but not 
limited to alcohol, the W-SUDs intervention supports and 
extends a growing body of literature on the use of automated 
conversational agents (or chatbots) and other mobile apps to 
support behavioral health. A systematic review of mobile and 
web-based interventions targeting the reduction of problematic 
substance use found that most web-based interventions produced 
significant short-term improvements in at least one measure of 
problematic substance use [6]. Mobile apps were less common 
than web-based interventions, with weaker evidence of efficacy 
and some indication of causing harm (ie, inadvertently helping 
users increase, rather than decrease, their blood alcohol level 
while partying). However, mobile interventions can be 
intervention 
efficacious. Electronic screening and brief 
programs, which use mobile tools to screen for excessive alcohol 
use and deliver personalized feedback, have been found to 
effectively reduce alcohol consumption and alcohol-related 
problems [58]. However, rigorous evaluation trials of digital 
interventions targeting nonalcohol substance use are limited 
[7]. Furthermore, although a systematic review concluded that 
conversational agents showed preliminary efficacy in reducing 
psychological distress among adults with mental health concerns 
compared with inactive control conditions [27], this is the first 
published study of a conversational agent adapted for substance 
use. 

Study Strengths 
Study strengths include study enrollment being double the initial 
recruitment goal, reflecting 
in W-SUDs. Most 
participants reported lifetime psychiatric diagnoses, and 
approximately half of the participants endorsed current 
moderate-to-severe levels of depression or anxiety. W-SUDs 
was used on average twice per week during the 8-week program. 
From pre- to posttreatment with W-SUDs, participants reported 
significant improvements in multiple measures of substance 
use and mood. The delivery modality of W-SUDs offered easy, 
immediate, and stigma-free access to emotional support and 
substance use recovery information, particularly relevant during 
a time of global physical distancing and sheltering in place. 
More time spent at home, coupled with reduced access to 
in-person mental health care, may have increased enrollment 
and engagement with the app. Although further data on 
recruitment and enrollment are warranted, these early findings 
suggest that individuals with SUDs are indeed interested in 
obtaining support for this condition from a fully digitalized 
conversational agent. 
Limitations and Future Directions 
This study had a single-group design, and the outcomes were 
short term and limited to posttreatment, thus limiting the strength 

of inferences that can be drawn. The sample was predominately 
female and identified as non-Hispanic White, and the majority 
were employed full-time. Non-Hispanic White participants 
reported higher program acceptability on 2 of the 4 measures 
compared with participants from other racial or ethnic groups. 
Future research on W-SUDs will use a randomized design, with 
longer follow-up, and focus on recruitment of a more diverse 
population 
inform racial or ethnic cultural 
programmatic tailoring, using quotas to ensure racial or ethnic 
diversity in sampling. Notably, although recruited from across 
the United States, nearly all participants (99/101, 98.0%) were 
sheltering in place at the time of study enrollment due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, which may have affected substance use 
patterns and mood as well as interest in a digital health 
intervention. Notably, however, alcohol sales in the United 
States increased during the COVID-19 pandemic [59]. The 
primary outcomes of substance use, cravings, confidence, mood, 
and program acceptability were standard measures with 
demonstrated validity and reliability. The limitations were that 
all were self-reported, and acceptability measures were not 
open-ended or qualitative. Few participants were misusing 
opioids, likely due to study exclusion designed to mitigate risk, 
namely, the requirement of engagement with medication-assisted 
treatment and no history of opioid overdose requiring Narcan 
(naloxone). Notably, nearly 1400 people with interest in a 
program for those with substance use concerns were excluded 
due to low severity on the CAGE-AID screener. Worth testing 
is the utility of digital health programs for early intervention on 
substance misuse that is subsyndromal. 
Building upon the findings of this study, future research will 
evaluate W-SUDs in a randomized controlled trial with a more 
racially or ethnically diverse sample, balanced on sex and 
primary problematic substance of use; will employ greater 
strategies for study retention (eg, increased incentives, obtaining 
phone contact details, and sending more outreach reminders); 
and will be conducted during a period with less restrictions on 
social contacts and physical mobility. Randomized controlled 
evaluations of conversational agent interventions relative to 
other treatment modalities are required [27,60]. 
Conclusions 
This study is the first empirical evaluation of an SUD-focused 
digital therapeutic delivered via a fully automated conversational 
agent. The therapeutic approach is acceptable, feasible, and 
safe. The study observed significant reductions in substance 
use and cravings in the context of population-level shifts in the 
pattern of substance use during a global pandemic. The 
scalability and accessibility of an automated program coupled 
with the growing problem of substance use suggest the potential 
for an engaging and effective therapeutic to reduce the burden 
of SUDs. Further research is needed to quantify the adoption 
potential and population impacts of an efficacious digital 
therapeutic conversational agent for SUD treatment.
