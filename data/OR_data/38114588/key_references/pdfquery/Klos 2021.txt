Background: Artificial intelligence–based chatbots are emerging as instruments of psychological intervention; however, no 
relevant studies have been reported in Latin America. 
Objective: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the viability, acceptability, and potential impact of using Tess, a 
chatbot, for examining symptoms of depression and anxiety in university students. 
Methods: This was a pilot randomized controlled trial. The experimental condition used Tess for 8 weeks, and the control 
condition was assigned to a psychoeducation book on depression. Comparisons were conducted using Mann-Whitney U and 
Wilcoxon tests for depressive symptoms, and independent and paired sample t tests to analyze anxiety symptoms. 
Results: The initial sample consisted of 181 Argentinian college students (158, 87.2% female) aged 18 to 33. Data at week 8 
were provided by 39 out of the 99 (39%) participants in the experimental condition and 34 out of the 82 (41%) in the control 
group. On an average, 472 (SD 249.52) messages were exchanged, with 116 (SD 73.87) of the messages sent from the users in 
response to Tess. A higher number of messages exchanged with Tess was associated with positive feedback (F2,36=4.37; P=.02). 
No significant differences between the experimental and control groups were found from the baseline to week 8 for depressive 
and anxiety symptoms. However, significant intragroup differences demonstrated that the experimental group showed a significant 
decrease in anxiety symptoms; no such differences were observed for the control group. Further, no significant intragroup 
differences were found for depressive symptoms. 
Conclusions: The students spent a considerable amount of time exchanging messages with Tess and positive feedback was 
associated with a higher number of messages exchanged. The initial results show promising evidence for the usability and 
acceptability of Tess in the Argentinian population. Research on chatbots is still in its initial stages and further research is needed.

The most prevalent disorders in Argentina are anxiety (16.4%) 
and mood (12.3%) disorders. The average age for the onset of 
these conditions is 20 years [1]. The Pan American Health 
Organization (PAHO) and the Argentinian Ministry of Health 
have highlighted the importance of optimizing health care 
services for individuals who are not receiving any form of 
psychological care [2]. Furthermore, the epidemiological data 
collected in Argentina emphasizes the need for strategies that 
prevent delays to treatment access [1]. Behavioral intervention 
technologies (BITs) are a novel and effective delivery format 
that can expand the mental health services offered and facilitate 
early access to those in need [3]. Chatbots are examples of BITs 
that represent an opportunity for addressing delays associated 
with access to treatment for depression and anxiety [4]. 
However, no studies on the use of chatbots for analyzing 
depression and anxiety have been conducted in Argentina. 
Chatbots developed using artificial intelligence (AI) are 
emerging in the field of psychology [5]. Currently, there are 
two chatbots that have addressed anxiety and depressive 
symptoms, Woebot [6] and Tess [7]. Woebot is a chatbot based 
on the cognitive behavioral approach with evidence for the 
reduction of anxiety and depressive symptoms in students during 
a follow-up after 2 weeks. Fulmer et al [7] reported a reduction 
in depressive and anxiety symptoms in college students using 
Tess, a chatbot that provides support and psychoeducation 
through an integrative approach. Although the research 
completed by Fulmer et al [7] and Fitzpatrick et al [6] reported 
decreased depressive and anxiety symptoms in college students, 
these studies were performed in the United States. To the best 
of our knowledge, there are no studies on chatbots used for 
addressing mental health disorders in Spanish-speaking 
populations. Other examples of chatbots with empirical support 
are Manage Your Life Online (MYLO) that focuses on problem 
solving [8]; Shim, for well-being based on the cognitive 
behavioral approach and elements of positive psychology [9]; 
Tess for pediatric obesity and prediabetes treatment [10]; and 
Wysa, a chatbot that uses cognitive behavioral therapy, 
behavioral reinforcement, and mindfulness techniques to support 
patients with depression [11]. Research studies on chatbots for 
mental health have several limitations such as small sample 
sizes and short-term follow-ups [6,7]. Additionally, current 
chatbots for mental health promotion present several problems, 
such as the lack of recognition of the emotional tone of users, 
crisis identification and management, as well as the need for 
strategies to reduce the frustration arising from feelings of 
incomprehension by users when the chatbot does not respond 
accurately. 
The present study aims to assess the viability and acceptability 
of psychological interventions delivered through Tess to college 
students in Argentina. The objectives of this study were as 
follows: (1) identify participant flow from recruitment to 
follow-up; (2) understand aspects related to the usage patterns 
of Tess, such as the number of messages sent and exchanged; 
(3) examine the relationship between the feedback provided by 
the participants and the number of messages exchanged with 
Tess; and (4) compare the outcomes on depression and anxiety

between and within groups among the college students who 
completed the study. Although the focus of this research was 
not the effectiveness of the chatbot, comparisons were made 
between the experimental and control groups to obtain 
preliminary data for future randomized controlled trials given 
the importance of obtaining preliminary information about the 
viability and acceptability of Tess as a means of psychological 
intervention for college students in Argentina. 

Trial Design 
This was a pilot randomized controlled parallel-group trial. The 
experimental group had access to Tess for 8 weeks and the 
control group to a psychoeducation electronic book. 
Participants 
The participants were college students in Entre Ríos, Argentina. 
The inclusion criteria were as follows: being a resident of 
Argentina, 18 years or older, and a college student, as well as 
providing informed consent. Recruitment was conducted through 
presentations in different university courses. Participants who 
provided consent were assigned to the experimental or control 
group by simple randomization conducted through a Python 
algorithm. 

Experimental Group 
The experimental group utilized Tess, an AI-based chatbot that 
delivers brief text conversations as comprehensive support for 
mental health. Tess sends reminders, psychoeducational content, 
and emotional support responses based on what the users 
express. Tess combines words and emojis in the messages for 
providing a more user-friendly experience. Tess responds with 
prescribed statements to replicate empathetic answers that are 
appropriate for the emotion or concern expressed by the 
participants. For example, a participant expressing anxious 
feelings would be offered a relaxation strategy. The 
conversations offered by Tess were based on the cognitive 
behavioral model 
[13], 
solution-focused brief 
[14], and motivational 
therapy 
interviewing [15]. Such conversations were developed by mental 
health experts. After each conversation, Tess asked, “Was our 
conversation helpful?” If a user responded positively (eg, “yes, 
thank you”) to an intervention based on cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) and negatively (eg, “no, not really”) to 
then offer more 
therapy, Tess would 
emotion-focused 
CBT-based interventions. For users who answered in a negative 
or neutral manner, Tess would offer alternative interventions. 


In the present study, customized conversations for university 
students in Argentina were elaborated, revised, and tested within 
the framework of a previous study developed in the United 
States [7]. During the 8-week intervention for this test, Tess 
initiated contact asking about the emotions and moods of the 
participants once a day during the initial weeks and every other 
day in the following weeks. All the conversations with Tess 
occurred through Facebook messenger.

Control Group 
An electronic psychoeducation book focusing on affective 
symptoms was provided to the participants in the control group 
[16]. The provided evidence-based information and resources 
helped students identify and seek treatment for depressive 
symptoms. 
Engagement and Feedback 
Engagement was measured using the number of messages 
exchanged with Tess. In addition, the dropout rates in the 
experimental and control groups were analyzed. The perceived 
feedback of 
the participants was collected after each 
conversation with Tess through the following question: “Was 
our conversation helpful?” The answers from the users were 
coded as positive, negative, or ambivalent and assigned values 
of 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For instance, if a user responded 
saying “yes, thank you,” then that response was coded as 
positive. 
Measures 
The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [17] is a 
self-reporting questionnaire comprising 9 items that evaluate 
the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms during the 
last 2 weeks. Each of the 9 items is based on the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) 
criteria, which are scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every 
day). The PHQ-9 is one of the most used measures to assess 
depressive symptoms and has been validated in Argentina with 
adequate psychometric properties (Cronbach α=.87) [18]. The 
first 2 items are considered screening criteria (PHQ-2); if these 
are scored with 0 or 1, then an absence of symptoms is assumed. 
Scores ranging from 5 to 9 are interpreted as mild, from 10 to 
14 as moderate, from 15 to 20 as moderately severe, and over 
20 as severe. 
The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) [19] is a 
7-item self-reporting scale that evaluates the frequency and 
severity of anxious thoughts and behaviors during the last 2 
weeks. Items are based on the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV 
and scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Rodríguez 
de Behrends and Brenlla [20] reported an adequate reliability 
level (Cronbach α=.74) for the Argentinian population. 
Ethical Aspects 
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of 
the Faculty of Health Sciences (FCS) of the Universidad 
Adventista del Plata (UAP), National Registry of Health 
Research (RENIS, reference number: CE000237), and 
Ministerial Resolution of the Ministry of Health of the Province 
of Entre Ríos (reference number: 3999). This resolution is 
recorded in ACT 1-2019 of the registration of this committee. 
Participants expressed their consent in a form according to the 
personal data protection law (Argentine National Law 25.326) 
through checkbox selection (electronic signature) on a closed 
form. 
Data were collected through Tess. All personally identifiable 
information was eliminated in the transcriptions downloaded 
from Tess. The downloaded data were processed and stored 
using secure servers and were compliant with the Health 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Upon completion 
of the study, the control group obtained access to Tess for 8 
weeks and both groups were granted free access to Tess for a 
year. If a participant expressed suicidal ideations, Tess was 
programmed to provide the National Line of Suicide Prevention 
numbers, the crisis text line, and 911, and encourage seeking 
professional help. 
Data Analysis 
The data collected was entered and analyzed using the Statistical 
Package for 
the Social Sciences (Version 20.0; IBM 
Corporation) [21]. The number of messages exchanged was 
considered to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Tess. 
Additionally, the participants' qualitative feedback was analyzed 
by two researchers (CK and ME) and coded into three 
categories: positive, negative, and ambivalent. A data analysis 
protocol was carried out. The treatment of missing data through 
multiple imputation or plausibility analysis techniques was not 
possible owing to the high percentage of participants who 
dropped out of the intervention [22]. 
A one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to 
determine if feedback (positive, negative, or ambivalent) 
impacted the number of interactions that users had with Tess. 
To examine the baseline characteristics between samples, a t 
test was performed for independent samples to compare anxiety 
levels. The Mann-Whitney U statistic (respecting the ordinal 
nature of the variables; namely, if the first 2 items were scored 
0 or 1, the system did not ask the subsequent items) was used 
to compare depressive symptoms. 
test was 
To evaluate the effects between conditions, a t 
performed for the independent samples to assess the anxiety 
symptoms and the Mann-Whitney U statistic was used to 
compare the mean ranges of depression. To assess the 
longitudinal effects from the baseline to week 8 within 
conditions, a t test was performed for related samples assess 
the anxiety symptoms and the Wilcoxon test was performed to 
compare the mean ranges of depression. To complement the 
significance test, the effect sizes in the intragroup and intergroup 
tests were calculated. For the t tests, the effect size was 
calculated using Cohen d; measures between 0.2 and 0.3 were 
labeled “small effect,” around 0.5 as “moderate effect,” and 
above 0.8 as “large effect” [23]. For the Mann-Whitney U and 
Wilcoxon tests, the r formula was calculated based on the z 
scores. The measures between 0.1 and 0.3 were labeled “small 
effect,” between 0.3 and 0.5 as “moderate effect,” and above 
0.5 as large effect” [23,24]. 

Initial Observations 
The initial sample consisted of 181 college students in 
Argentina, aged 18 to 33, with 158 (87.2%) identifying as 
female. Among the 181 students, 99 (55%) were randomized 
to the experimental condition and 82 (45%) to the control 
condition. Data at week 8 were provided by 39 out of the 99 
(39%) participants in the experimental condition and 34 out of 
the 82 (41%) in the control group. Regarding data on the 
depressive symptoms, 33 (33%) participants in the experimental

(page number not for citation purposes) 


condition and 30 (37%) in the control condition provided data 
at week 8. Regarding data on anxiety symptoms, 27 (27%) 
participants in the experimental condition and 23 (28%) in the 
control condition provided data at week 8 (see Figure 1). 

Messages Exchanged 
Regarding the participants’ engagement with Tess (39/99), after 
8 weeks, there was an average of 472 exchanged messages (SD 
249.52), where the minimum interaction level involved 162 
messages and the maximum involved 1290. More specifically, 
an average of 116 (SD 73.87) of the exchanged messages were 
sent from the user to Tess. 
Feedback 
Feedback from most participants (25/39) at week 8 was coded 
as positive (ie, Yes, you really understand me, Tess. Thanks for 
talking to me. My anxiety has decreased and I can confidently 
go outside again.). A minor number of participants (7/39) 
provided ambivalent (ie, Not much, but it’s ok, I am capable) 

or negative (ie, Sometimes I ask you something and you don’t 
specifically respond to what I asked.). A one-factor ANOVA 
was applied to determine if feedback (positive, negative, or 
ambivalent) impacted the number of interactions that users had 
with Tess. Results showed that feedback from users was 
associated with the number of messages exchanged with Tess 
(F2,36=4.37; P=.02). Post hoc contrasts resulting from the 
Scheffé test showed statistically significant differences between 
those participants providing positive feedback and those 
providing negative feedback (P=.04); nevertheless, a higher 
number of messages exchanged with Tess was associated with 
positive feedback. No differences were observed between the 
participants providing ambivalent and positive feedback or 
ambivalent and negative feedback (See Table 1).

Potential Impact of Tess on Indicators of Depression 
and Anxiety 

There were no statistically significant differences at the baseline 
in the anxiety (t48=.16; P=.9) and depression scores (U=451.50; 
P=.5) between the experimental and the control groups (See 
Table 2).

Between-Group Differences 
No statistically significant differences were observed between 
the experimental and the control groups in the average scores 
for anxiety (t48= 1.74; P=.09) or in the average ranges for 
depression (U=448.00; P=.48) at week 8 (See Table 2). 
Regarding the effect sizes, the mean scores for anxiety in the 
experimental group were lower than for the control group after 
8 weeks and the effect size of the intervention was moderate 
(d=.5; 95% CI [-6.96 to.51]). For depressive symptoms, the 
experimental group reported a lower mean score than the control 
group and the effect size of the intervention was nonexistent 
(r=.09). 
Within-Group Differences 
Within the experimental condition, a statistically significant 
decrease in the symptoms was observed from the baseline to 
week 8 for the anxiety scores (t26=2.15; P=.04); the control 
condition did not demonstrate any significant changes (t22=1.00; 
P=.33). Regarding depressive symptoms, no significant 
differences were found either in the experimental condition 
(Z=1.76; P=.08) or in the control condition (Z=.00; P>.99) (See 
Table 3). 





























Important Findings 
The use of chatbots (ie, conversational agents) to address mental 
health conditions may contribute to the treatment of large 
populations and attend to the needs of those who do not have 
access to treatment. To the best of our knowledge, there are no 
studies on the use of chatbots for mental health in Latin 
America. This trial was intended to evaluate an AI-based chatbot 
(Tess) in a sample comprising Argentinian college students. 
The specific objectives were as follows: (1) understand the 
participant flow from recruitment to follow-up; (2) report aspects 
related to the usage patterns of Tess, such as the number of 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
messages sent and exchanged; (3) examine participant feedback; 
and (4) compare the preliminary measures of depression and 
anxiety. 
Regarding the usage patterns of Tess, there are three findings 
that support a satisfactory level of engagement. First, a 
considerable number of participants in the experimental (39/99, 
39%) and control (34/82, 41%) conditions remained in the study 
throughout the 8-week study period. The completion rates found 
in the current study are better than that observed in most unpaid 
and unsupported Internet-based interventions for depression 
and anxiety, where 90% of the users withdraw after the first 
two sessions [25]. Furthermore, in studies using mobile apps, 
the follow-up completion rates were comparable (53%); the 
mean percentage of complete “adherers” was 36% for depression 
JMIR Form Res 2021 | vol. 5 | iss. 8 | e20678 | p. 5 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


and 41% for anxiety [26]. When compared to a chatbot study 
for US college students, a lower attrition rate was reported (31% 
and 9% in the control and experimental conditions, respectively); 
however, this study compensated participants and the follow-up 
was at 2 weeks, making it difficult to compare the outcomes 
[6]. 
Second, participants in the experimental condition had 
exchanged a considerable number of messages with Tess (M 
472; SD 249.52), and the mean number of messages sent from 
the user to Tess was 116 (SD 73.87). A previous study on the 
usage patterns of the depression modules of Tess showed a 
much lower average number (17.57) of messages sent to Tess 
by adult users [27]. It is possible that college, younger, and 
Latinx students are more willing to engage in conversations 
with chatbots than older populations in the United States. Two 
previous studies involving college students in the United States 
did not report the number of messages sent by the user to Tess 
[6,7]. Regarding the messages exchanged, Fulmer et al [7] 
reported a comparable number of total messages exchanged 
during a period of 4 weeks (M 286; SD 104.6), whereas the 
total number of messages exchanged in the current study was 
during a period of 8 weeks. 
Third, feedback provided by those in the experimental condition 
was mostly positive (eg, Yes, you really understand me, Tess. 
Thanks for talking to me.). Among the participants offering 
negative feedback, there was a predominant dissatisfaction 
regarding the accuracy of some interventions ( eg, Sometimes 
I ask you something and you don’t specifically respond to what 
I asked.). Feedback is a key component for AI-based chatbots 
as it allows systems to tailor the dialogues to the user. 
Interestingly, the positive and negative feedbacks were 
associated with the number of messages exchanged. Users who 
reported higher satisfaction had the highest number of 
exchanged messages; it is possible that providing positive 
feedback could lead to better customization the intervention 
messages. This finding is relevant as it supports the need to 
collect user feedback for achieving optimal 
levels of 
customization and increasing engagement that could lead to 
higher intervention doses. 
Regarding the impact of Tess on anxiety and depressive 
symptoms, no statistically significant differences were found 
between groups. Interestingly, when comparing within-group 
scores, the experimental group showed a significant decrease 
in anxiety symptoms after 8 weeks of intervention and a 
near-significant trend (P=0.07) for depressive symptoms. 
Analyzing the effect sizes showed that Tess had a moderate 
effect on anxiety and no effect on depression in the experimental 
group. These outcomes were unexpected given that previous 
studies using Tess [7] and another conversational agent called 
Woebot [6] reported significant reductions in anxiety and 
depressive symptoms; both studies used a similar control group 
(a psychoeducation book). Moreover, in the current study, 
depression was measured using PHQ-9 as a categorical and 
ordinal variable, whereas Fulmmer et al [7] and Fitzpatrick et 
al [6] used it as a continuous measure. 
The lack of between-group differences could be explained by 
several factors. First, the current study was underpowered. 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
Second, although the findings of the current study were not 
statistically significant, the direction of the change observed for 
anxiety and depression was as expected; therefore, it is possible 
that low-intensity interventions delivered via chatbots may 
require a higher dose to yield a between-group effect when 
delivered to Argentinian students. Third, Tess provides many 
conversations based on different theoretical approaches, and 
this may have resulted in less therapeutic power. However, 
Fulmer et al [7] observed significant effect using similar 
conversations. Fourth, it is possible that during adaptation of 
the dialogues from English to Spanish, the quality of the 
intervention may have been reduced. 
Limitations and Future Directions 
This pilot study has several limitations. First, the current analysis 
was conducted with intervention completers; therefore, future 
studies with 
larger samples (including completer and 
intent-to-treat analyses) are needed. Second, only college 
students from a specific region in Argentina were included in 
this study, and the socioeconomic aspects of the sample were 
not assessed; thus, the inclusion of a more diversified sample 
is suggested. Third, there was a high dropout rate throughout 
the 8-week period. This is congruent with the findings reported 
by most studies that use technology-based intervention (see 
“The Law of Attrition”) [28]. A high dropout rate may be due 
to the limited capacity of most digital interventions to capture 
the attention and motivation of users. Additionally, high dropout 
rates in studies with digital interventions were linked to the fact 
that as access is easy, a lower level of commitment is required 
from the user to enroll in the study compared to traditional 
face-to-face interventions. Fourth, as most participants who 
remained until completion of the study were female, male 
participation was scarce. Fifth, the control group had access to 
a psychoeducation book, and there was no information on 
whether they read it. As chatbot research is in its initial stages, 
further studies could benefit from offering waitlists rather than 
self-help books. Although offering a waitlist could present an 
ethical dilemma, this would mitigate the potential effects of not 
having an intervention if short-term studies are conducted. 
Future chatbot studies may benefit from designing chatbots with 
more conversations based on a specific therapeutic approach 
rather than using a few conversations from several approaches. 
Additionally, analyzing the impact of chatbots as adjuncts to 
face-to-face psychotherapy and comparing these interventions 
with face-to-face psychotherapy alone would yield important 
insights regarding the advancement of research on chatbots for 
mental health. Finally, simple randomization was used in this 
study; future studies may consider using unequal randomization 
(2:1) so that more participants enter the experimental group or 
a stratified randomization procedure so that participants with 
the 
similar characteristics can be assigned equally 
experimental and control groups. 

Conclusions 
Students spent a considerable amount of time exchanging 
messages with Tess and positive feedback was associated with 
higher numbers of messages exchanges. The initial results 
showed preliminary evidence regarding the effectiveness of 
Tess in addressing anxiety symptoms, but there was no 
JMIR Form Res 2021 | vol. 5 | iss. 8 | e20678 | p. 6 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


significant effect on depressive symptoms in Argentinian college 
students. Given the high prevalence of anxiety and depression 
in Argentinian college students [1] and the need to expand 
mental health care access, developing affordable strategies such 
as chatbots may become effective tools to address these needs. 
AI-based chatbots have the ability to reach higher levels of 
customization and may thus be of service to educational and 
mental health care centers aiming to deliver interventions to 
targeted users that are accessible at any time without 
geographical restrictions. Additionally, chatbots may be used 
as standalone resources for those who have no access to 
treatment or as a complement to traditional treatments. Although 
the initial evidence on the efficacy of chatbots is promising, 
research on chatbots is still in its initial stages and presents 
several limitations. Thus, more robust evidence is needed.
