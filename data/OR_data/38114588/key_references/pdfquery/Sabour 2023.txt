Introduction: The growing demand for mental health support has highlighted the 
importance of conversational agents as human supporters worldwide and in 
China. These agents could increase availability and reduce the relative costs of 
mental health support. The provided support can be divided into two main 
types: cognitive and emotional. Existing work on this topic mainly focuses on 
constructing agents that adopt Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles. 
Such agents operate based on pre-deﬁned templates and exercises to provide 
cognitive support. However, research on emotional support using such agents is 
the constructed agents operate in English, 
limited. 
highlighting the importance of conducting such studies in China. To this end, 
we introduce Emohaa, a conversational agent that provides cognitive support 
through CBT-Bot exercises and guided conversations. 
It also emotionally 
supports users through ES-Bot, enabling them to vent their emotional problems. 
In this study, we analyze the effectiveness of Emohaa in reducing symptoms of 
mental distress. 
Methods and Results: Following the RCT design, the current study randomly 
assigned participants into three groups: Emohaa (CBT-Bot), Emohaa (Full), and 
(N = 134) 
control. With both Intention-To-Treat 
analyses, 
the results demonstrated that compared to the control group, 
participants who used two types of Emohaa experienced considerably more 
signiﬁcant improvements in symptoms of mental distress, including depression 
(F[2, 244] = 6.26, p = 0.002), negative affect (F[2, 244] = 6.09, p = 0.003), and 
insomnia (F[2, 244] = 3.69, p = 0.026). 
Discussion: Based on the obtained results and participants’ satisfaction with the 
platform, we concluded that Emohaa is a practical and effective tool 
for 
reducing mental distress.

Concerns regarding mental health are prevalent in the modern world due to the 
increasing morbidity of mental diseases (1). During the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, 
anxiety, and other mental health issues have increased signiﬁcantly (2). Speciﬁcally, a 






review by Lakhan et al. (2) highlighted a 20% and 35% rise in 
depression and anxiety, 
for 113,285 individuals 
respectively, 
across 16 studies. Additionally, an international study with a 
sample of 22,330 adults 
the 
participants met the criteria for a probable insomnia disorder 
(3). These mental health issues impact people’s daily lives, 
leading to social dysfunction and risks of self-harm and suicide 
(4). Due to the rapidly increasing demands, mental health 
lack of 
challenges 
services worldwide 
professional training and stigmatization of mental illness. These 
challenges can lead to low diagnosis accuracy and patient 
treatment delays (2). 



Similarly, the prevalence of mental health diseases in China is 
increasing (5–7). According to the epidemiological 
survey of 
mental disorders in China (8), 
the lifetime prevalence rate of 
mental disorders in adults, excluding senile dementia, is 16.57%. 
Speciﬁcally, the prevalence of anxiety disorder was reported the 
highest in China, with a 12-month prevalence rate of 4.98% (8). 
While possessing one of the largest populations worldwide, the 
number of licensed psychiatrists, though gradually increasing, 
is 
extremely limited, with a recent estimate suggesting that China had 
only 36,610 psychiatrists (2.6 per 100,000 population) in 2018 
(9, 10). Similar to the limited number of mental health services in 
China, the quality of such services is also inadequate (7, 8, 11). 
Additionally, recent research has also shown that stigmas related to 
mental health support in China and concerns regarding burdening 
others also affect an individual’s willingness to seek support 
(12, 13). Due to these challenges, only a limited number of 
Chinese patients are receiving appropriate support and treatment. 
Hence, the invention of high-technology tools or treatments in 
China is essential as 
it can provide effective, available, and 
affordable support for improving individuals’ mental health. 


Advancements in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and the ﬁeld of 
(NLP) have highlighted the

to 
conversational agents (11). One of the essential applications of 
such agents is health care, mainly for providing mental health 
support. Employing machines for such tasks increases availability 
while reducing the costs of seeking support, as these agents could 
be widely accessible and affordable through mobile devices (14). 
Previous work has shown that individuals are willing to self- 
disclose their emotional problems with machines (15–17), which 
is signiﬁcant as users’ self-disclosure is essential for providing 
support. It demonstrates user rapport with these agents and 
highlights their potential as practical and beneﬁcial supporters 
(18), thus serving as a strong motivation for this study. 
Extensive research has been conducted on the effects of machine- 
based support. As proposed by Rimé (19), there are two main types of 
support to reduce mental distress: cognitive and emotional. Cognitive 
support enables individuals to reassess their situation from a different 
perspective and realize a new way of thinking about their problem 
(20, 21). 
includes providing 
validation and understanding to cause relief and improve emotional 
distress (20, 22, 23). Recent work has mainly focused on delivering 
cognitive support through conversational agents adopting Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles and has demonstrated the 



efﬁcacy of such interventions in reducing users’ mental distress, 
mainly depression and anxiety (14, 24–26). While most of the 
existing research on this topic is in English (18, 27, 28), there have 
been attempts to create Chinese chatbots for CBT (26, 29–31), 
demonstrating the importance of employing such systems in China. 
In addition, research on machine-based emotional support is 
comparatively limited. Liu et al. (23) constructed a dataset of 
emotional support conversations based on Hill’s (22) helping skills 
and demonstrated the feasibility of machine-based emotional 
support. Their work facilitated the research in this direction, and 
several approaches have been proposed to improve machines’ 
emotional support ability (32–37). These approaches achieved 
promising results on aspect-based human evaluation (e.g., ﬂuency 
and coherence). However, 
their corresponding studies did not 
create prototype agents, nor did they conduct empirical studies of 
their effectiveness in reducing users’ mental distress. In addition, 
implemented in English, 
all of 
highlighting the lack of 
for Chinese 
machine-based emotional support. 




To the best of our knowledge, Pauw et al. (21) presented the ﬁrst 
and only study investigating the effects of different types of machine- 
based support, 
their 
proposed prototypes only produced a set of pre-deﬁned statements 
(e.g., “I am sorry to hear that”) rather than generating responses 
based on the users’ messages. Therefore, with mental health being 
a rising issue in the Chinese community, existing high demands 
for available and affordable support in China, and the limited 
research in this area, we believe constructing and conducting a 
study on a conversational agent for support in Chinese is crucial. 
This study investigates the efﬁcacy of conversational agents for 
providing cognitive and emotional support. Speciﬁcally, it aims to 
study the effectiveness of agents providing different types of support 
the acceptability and 
in reducing mental distress and assess 
practicality of such interventions for mental health support. We 
introduce Emohaa, a hybrid system involving a platform based on 
CBT principles 
and a 
conversational platform for emotional support regarding various 
topics. We recruit participants from mainland China and hypothesize 
that using Emohaa, which includes completing daily exercises and 
emotional venting, would improve their symptoms of mental distress, 
speciﬁcally depression, anxiety, negative affect, and insomnia. 






Our proposed conversational agent consists of two platforms. 
First, a template-based platform that contains conversations with 
pre-deﬁned options and exercises 
in 
improving their mental distress based on CBT principles (CBT- 
allows 
Bot). 
conversations regarding various emotional issues in an open-ended 
manner (i.e., without requiring the users to choose predeﬁned 
conversational options) and provides emotional support (ES-Bot). 









2.1.1. Cognitive behavioral therapy chatbot 
(CBT-Bot) 


Creating a platform based on CBT principles postulates a direct 
and 
interaction between thoughts, 
and reciprocal 
behaviors that helps illuminate understanding of one’s overall 
emotional distress and situational responses while highlighting 
areas for intervention (38). As a tool for cognitive support, we 
integrated two different practices: automatic thoughts training 
and guided expressive writing. 
automatic 
thoughts in response to a trigger, often outside of that one’s 
conscious awareness. These thoughts could often be irrational 
and harmful when associated with mental distress (39). As one 
of 
the core elements of CBT (38, 40), automatic thoughts 
training aims to identify and dismantle these thoughts (i.e., 
replace negative thoughts with rational perspectives), which could 
reduce mental distress and improve one’s mood (38, 41). In 
addition, previous studies have shown that writing about stressful 
or emotional events improves physical and psychological health 
in non-clinical and clinical populations (42, 43). Therefore, we 
adopted over 20 guided expressive writing exercises that cover a 
variety of topics and instruct users throughout each step of the 
exercise via interactive conversations. 
On this platform, participants are initially given a set of 
conversational choices on this platform and are accordingly 
introduced to CBT and how to use this platform (Figure 1A). 
Accordingly, 
they are provided with two types of exercises: 
guided expressive writing and automatic thinking. An example of 
a guided writing exercise is shown in Figure 1B, where users are 
asked to ﬁll out parts of their diary about a given topic in several 
steps. Automatic thinking exercises (Figure 2) present the user 
with a hypothetical scenario and require them to take the 
person’s perspective in that situation. Accordingly, they are asked 
a question regarding the correct approach to take in that 
person’s situation and report their conﬁdence in their answer. 
Lastly, they are shown the correct answer about how to approach 
and gain a new perspective in such scenarios. To assess the 
efﬁcacy of the exercises, we require users to report their mood 
after completing an exercise and describe their emotions using a 
set of pre-deﬁned keywords. This platform is publicly available 
on WeChat, China’s most popular social media platform. 

Several studies have shown that emotional support is beneﬁcial 
for reducing mental and emotional distress (34, 44, 45). In

addition, allowing users to discuss their desired topics freely is 
crucial 
conversational agents. 
Therefore, we aimed to construct an agent that could openly 
converse with users about their emotional problems and generate 
responses based on their situation. To this end, we found Liu 
et al.’s (23) dataset of emotional support conversations (ESConv) 
suitable for this study. This dataset was constructed based on the 
Helping Skills Theory (22), in which trained human supporters

afﬁrmation, and suggestions) 
to provide adequate emotional 
support. As the original dataset was curated in English, 
the 
conversations were manually translated into Chinese by trained 
professionals for the purpose of 
this study. Back-translation 
procedures (46) were followed to ensure the precision of the 
items. Speciﬁcally, we asked an English major who also had a 
psychology background to translate the English version into 
Chinese. Then another student 
translated back the Chinese 
version into English. Then we invited three professionals to 
compare, revise and decide on the ﬁnal translation. 

For building the ES-Bot platform, a large-scale Chinese 
dialogue model (47) was leveraged as the backbone to build a 
strategy-controlled 
dialogue model. 
Speciﬁcally, the model chooses an appropriate support strategy 




generates 
given the 
that are coherent with the user’s messages and 
responses 
conform to the chosen strategy. Given the free-ﬂow design of 
this platform, as opposed to users choosing pre-deﬁned options 
for the conversation, an additional model (48) was trained to 
classify whether users’ messages demonstrated signs of suicidal 
thoughts to ensure users’ safety. As individuals with the risk of 
the platform 
immediate professional help, 
suicide 
recommends contact information of relevant authorities when 
corresponding signs are detected. Example conversations with 
this platform are demonstrated in Figure 3. Similarly, 
this 
platform is also publicly available on WeChat. 



Participants’ depression was measured with the Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (49), the most widely used measure in 
psychological depression trials (14, 50). PHQ-9 is a 9-item self- 
report questionnaire that measures the frequency and severity of 
depressive symptoms over the last two weeks. Participants were 
asked to score each item from 1 (not at all) to 4 (nearly every

day). In this study, the internal reliability of the scale (Cronbach’s 
alpha) in the pre-test and the post-test were 0.78 and 0.85. 

To measure participants’ anxiety, we adopted the Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale (51), a 7-item questionnaire 
assessing the frequency and severity of symptoms, thoughts, and 
two weeks. Like 
related behaviors to anxiety within the last 
PHQ-9, participants were required to score each item from 1 
(not at all) to 4 (nearly every day). The Cronbach’s alpha of this 
scale in the pre-test and the post-test were both 0.84. 



Participants’ affect was measured by Watson et al.’s (52) 20- 
item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). In this 
questionnaire, half of the items represent positive affect (e.g., 
active, 
remaining half 
corresponds to negative affect (e.g., upset, guilty, and irritable). 
All 
items are scored on a 5-Likert scale, and higher scores 
indicate higher levels of affect. The Cronbach’s alpha of 
the 
positive affect dimension in the pre-test and the post-test were 
0.88 and 0.82, and 0.85 and 0.82 for 
the negative affect 
dimension at the two-time points. 





The 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; (53)) was used to 
measure 
insomnia. This 
questionnaire assesses the severity of sleep-onset and maintenance 
difﬁculties, their interference with daily functioning, and the degree 
of distress caused by sleep problems. Participants were asked to 
score each item from 1 (none) to 4 (very severe). The Cronbach’s 
alpha of the scale in the pre-test and the post-test were both 0.87. 


Prior to the study, we used G*Power 3.1 to calculate the 
required number of participants. We set the large effect size f to 
be 0:40 while setting the power (1 (cid:1) b error probability) and a 
error probability to be 0:90 and 0:05, respectively. Thus, the 
required number of participants was calculated as 102. An online 
poster was made to recruit participants. We asked colleagues and 
friends to help release the recruitment 
information on their 
social media platforms, such as WeChat and Weibo. Participants 
who were interested in the study could contact our team based 
on the provided information in the advert. The following criteria 
were used to recruit participants 
through online posters: 
participants were required to be at least 18 years old, able to use

our study, and not suffering from physical issues such as physical

A total of 412 participants registered for the intervention, 
and 301 met all the above criteria. A research assistant, who 
was blinded to the purpose of the study, assigned a code based 
on the order that the participants contacted them. Accordingly, 
the participants were randomly assigned to three groups: 
Emohaa (CBT-Bot), Emohaa (Full), and the control group. 
Considering the relatively long waiting time and the potential 
number loss in the control group, we randomly allocated 30 
more 
an 
adopting 
the 3 groups. The 
approximate 3:3:4 allocation ratio for 
current study used a blank control group in which participants 
were asked to wait 
for a month before they would receive 
mindfulness intervention. 





After signing the consent form, participants were instructed 
to take the pre-test 
including PHQ-9, 
(T1) questionnaires, 
GAD-7, PANAS, and ISI (Section 2.2), and their demographic 
information. Sixteen participants were excluded from the study 
and referred to relative authorities for professional help as they 
were at risk of suicide according to their scores on an item 
from PHQ-9 (i.e., “how often have you been bothered by the 
thoughts that you would be better off dead or thoughts of 
in some way?”), and 38 participants were 
hurting yourself 
excluded because they did not complete the pre-test survey. 
Overall, 72 participants in the Emohaa (CBT-Bot) and 70 
participants 
in the Emohaa (Full) completed the pre-test 
questionnaires. 105 participants in the control group completed 
pre-test questionnaires. 
The entire intervention lasted for three consecutive weeks (i.e., 
21 days). Then, one day after the end of the intervention, all the 
participants were asked to ﬁll in the post-test (T2) questionnaire, 
which included the same items as T1. Additionally, one month 
after the end of the experiment, participants were invited to ﬁll 
in a follow-up questionnaire (T3) 
intervention to track the 
lasting effect of the intervention. From the perspective of health 
ethics and practical reasons, other forms of intervention could 
have been provided to the control group after the intervention. 
Hence, there were no valid data at T3 for the control group. The 
above recruitment process is illustrated in Figure 4. 

Of the randomized participants, 54.2% (134/247) went on to 
provide partial or complete data at T2. 
t-tests 
analyses did not detect evidence of signiﬁcant differences at T1 
between those who dropped out of the study versus those who

affect scores; or on insomnia (t ¼ 1:17; p ¼ 0:244). Additionally, 
we employed MCAR analyses (54) to test whether the data are 
missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random 
(MAR), or missing not at random (MNAR). The results showed 
that Chi-Square ¼ 42.98 (p , 0:001), demonstrating the MCAR 
pattern. 


As mentioned, the ES-Bot platform allows users to send their 
for 
desired text messages and employs a generative model 
producing its 
responses, as opposed to the template-based 
conversations (i.e., providing users with limited conversational 
options and producing pre-deﬁned answers) in the CBT-Bot 
platform. Due to the existing limitations of generative models, 
such as problems with response coherence and ﬂuency, we 
believed a direct comparison between the effectiveness of the two 
platforms was inappropriate. Therefore, we required participants 
in the Emohaa (Full) group to use both platforms and aimed to 
study the complementary effect of the ES-Bot platform rather 
than analyzing its respective efﬁcacy. 
Accordingly, a research assistant informed the participants of 
our code of conduct and asked for consent through WeChat. 
Participants were assured that their participation was voluntary 
and anonymous. All participants were required to complete the 
mental distress questionnaires (Section 2.2) at T1 and T2. 
Excluding the control group, all participants were instructed to 
use the CBT-Bot platform daily, which required completing at 
least one automatic thinking exercise and writing a guided 
expressive diary. However, participants were encouraged to 
In addition, 
complete more exercises 
participants from the Emohaa (Full) group were tasked to 
converse with the ES-Bot platform at least once daily. Each 
conversation session was required to last for 5–10 conversational 
turns. Participants were encouraged to continue chatting with 
the platform if they felt engaged in the conversation. Although 
there were no limitations on the 
topics, 
participants were encouraged to talk about two main types of 
emotional experiences and problems: Event-based (e.g., breaking 
up with a partner, problems with work/study, and nuisance 
complaints); Emotion-based (i.e., 
anger, 
sadness, anxiety). 






Participants’ usage of the platform was manually checked 
every three days. Those who failed to conform to the 
guidelines were notiﬁed and required to complete the relative 
tasks to ensure high adherence. In addition, conversations with 
the ES-Bot platform were analyzed to monitor the chatbot’s 
the conversations. For 
performance and the reliability of 
instance, during the ﬁrst check of 
it was 
found that 3/34 participants sent the same message multiple 
the requirements. These participants were 
times 


contacted and asked to repeat these conversations to ensure the 
experiment’s integrity. 

Regarding the conversations with Emohaa, participants were 
instructed not to share any personal 
information (e.g., name, 
address, and date of birth) that could be used to identify them. 
The data collected during the experiment are anonymized, stored 
securely, and will be available for research purposes through a 
request 
involving 
to the corresponding author. The studies 
human participants were reviewed and approved by Beijing 
Normal University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB Number: 
202209150101). Written informed consent to participate in this 
study was provided by the participants. 

We used two strategies for analyzing our results. In the main 
(ITT) 
context, we followed the Intention-To-Treat analysis 
principle (55) by including all 
the participants who initially 
participated in the research. In the supplemental analyses, we 
used completer cases by excluding participants who dropped out 
during the intervention period. 

Demographic information of our studied sample (n ¼ 247) is 
provided in Table 1. Overall, the majority of participants were female 
(107/134, 79.85%). The average age of the studied sample was 30.90 
years old (SD ¼ 7:92). Participants had worked for an average of 7.87 
years (SD ¼ 8:45) prior to the experiment. All of the participants were 
from Mainland China. As the baseline for participants’ mental distress, 
on average, 
the samples showed moderate ranges of depression 
(Mean ¼ 16:43, SD ¼ 5:01), moderate anxiety (Mean ¼ 16:23, 
SD ¼ 4:37), and moderate insomnia (Mean ¼ 16:45, SD ¼ 5:38). In 
regards to PANAS, participants, on average, demonstrated moderate 
levels of positive (Mean ¼ 24:76, SD ¼ 7:20) and negative affect 
(Mean ¼ 22:34, SD ¼ 6:35). 
We employed ANOVA and chi-squared test to see whether 
there were signiﬁcant differences 
(age, 
gender, education, PHQ-9, GAD-7, PA, NA, Insomnia) among

the three groups. The results showed that the three groups were not 
different in terms of baseline demographics of age (F ¼ 2:17, 
p ¼ 0:117) and gender (x2 ¼ 3:56, p ¼ 0:173). Additionally, the 
baseline variables of PHQ-9 (F ¼ 2:45, p ¼ 0:088), GAD-7 
(F ¼ 0:93, p ¼ 0:396), PA (F ¼ 0:83, p ¼ 0:438), NA (F ¼ 2:82, 
p ¼ 0:061), and Insomnia (F ¼ 2:76, p ¼ 0:065) 
showed no 
signiﬁcant differences among the three groups. 

We used the last observation forward (LOCF) method to 
conduct ITT analyses. Previous systematic reviews have shown 
that LOCF is one of the most commonly used and relatively 
conservative strategies in ITT analysis (56, 57). To investigate 
whether the effects of 
interventions were different from each 
other and from that of the control group, we conducted a one- 
way repeated measures MANOVA with time (two levels: pre-test 
and post-test) and group type (three levels: Emohaa (CBT-Bot) 
vs. Emohaa (Full) vs. Control) as the independent variables and 
the ﬁve mental health indicators as the dependent variables. 
First, as presented in Table 2, there were signiﬁcant Group (cid:3) 
F[2, 244] ¼ 6:26, 
Time 
interaction 
p ¼ 0:002, h2 ¼ 0:050, 
indicating a signiﬁcant difference in 
participants’ depression changes among the three groups, and 


such difference had a relatively small effect size that is smaller 
than 0.06 (58). Speciﬁcally, as Figure 5A shows, the intervention 
effects on depression stemmed from decreases in both Emohaa 
(CBT-Bot) (t ¼ (cid:1)2:25, p ¼ 0:027) and Emohaa (Full) group 
(t ¼ (cid:1)2:09, p ¼ 0:040) from pre-test to post-test, but there was 
an increase of depression in the control group (t ¼ 2:04, 
p ¼ 0:044) from pre-test to post-test. Moreover, we did not ﬁnd 
signiﬁcant differences between the two types of 
interventions 
(F[1, 140] ¼ 0:76, p ¼ 0:386). 

Similarly, we conducted the same MANOVA analyses to test 
whether participants’ 
the 
intervention period. The results revealed a main effect of time on 
anxiety, F[1, 244] ¼ 27:66, p , 0:001, h2 ¼ 0:102, 
indicating 
participants’ anxiety decreased over time. As Table 2 shows, the 
interaction effect of Group (cid:3) Time was not signiﬁcant on 
anxiety F[2, 224] ¼ 0:60, p ¼ 0:556, h2 ¼ 0:006. No signiﬁcant 
the two types of 
differences were found in the effects of 
interventions (F[1, 140] ¼ 0:38, p ¼ 0:538).

a relatively small effect size that is slightly larger than the small 
effect size of.01 (58). Speciﬁcally, as Figure 5C reveals, the effects 
stemmed from a signiﬁcant 
insomnia decrease in the Emohaa 
(CBT-Bot) group (t ¼ (cid:1)2:28, p ¼ 0:026), no signiﬁcant change of 
insomnia in Emohaa (Full) group (t ¼ (cid:1)2:03, p ¼ 0:055), and no

(t ¼ 0:88, p ¼ 0:379). We did not ﬁnd signiﬁcantly different effects 
of the two types of interventions (F[1, 140] ¼ 0:02, p ¼ 0:936). 

We additionally conducted a completer analysis with 134 cases. 
Speciﬁcally, the results of one-way repeated measures MANOVAs 
showed that there were signiﬁcant Time * Group interaction

Additionally, the results showed that there was a signiﬁcant

The results showed no interaction effect of Time * Group on 
PA (F[2, 131] ¼ 1:85, p ¼ 0:162, h2 ¼ 0:031), but such effect 
existed on NA (F[2, 131] ¼ 12:11, p , 0:001, h2 ¼ 0:160).

in the Emohaa (Full) group slightly decreased (t ¼ (cid:1)2:01,

the intervention effects robustly existed in 
depression, NA, and insomnia. However, the intervention effects 
on anxiety were not signiﬁcant using the ITT analysis strategy. 
The different results on Anxiety may be that the main effect of 
time on Anxiety is strong, which means that anxiety declined in 
all three groups, and with a stricter analysis strategy of ITT, the 
differences among the three groups become less salient. The 
intervention effect did not exist on PA, regardless of which 
analysis strategy we adopted. 
Furthermore, We collected participants’ data on the mental 
health indicators (Section 2.2) three weeks after the post-test. 
Due to practical reasons that participants in the control group 
received other forms of interventions after the post-test, we only 
collected two intervention groups’ data. 16 participants in the 
Emohaa (CBT-Bot) group and 27 in the Emohaa (Full) group 
returned the questionnaires. 
To compare the effects between the two intervention groups, we 
conducted MANOVA with time (three levels: pre-test, post-test, and 
three weeks after post-test) and group type (two levels: CBT-Bot 
Emohaa vs. full Emohaa) as the independent variables and the ﬁve 
mental health indicators as the dependent variables. We also 
adopted ITT analysis in comparing the results of the two groups. 
Results showed that there were no signiﬁcant interaction effects of 
Time (cid:3) Group on depression (F[2, 139] ¼ 0:16, p ¼ 0:853, 
2 ¼ 0:002), anxiety (F[2, 139] ¼ 0:37, p ¼ 0:693, h2 ¼ 0:003),

indicating that the changes of participants’ 
four mental health 
indicators did not vary from each other between the two groups. 
However, such interaction effect was signiﬁcant on insomnia

stemmed from that participants’ insomnia symptoms returned to

the pre-test 
participants’ 
insomnia in the Emohaa (Full) group continued 
improving after the intervention. 






During the experiment, participants had 7 conversation sessions 
with Emohaa on average (SD ¼ 6:62, Max ¼ 18, Min ¼ 4). These 
turns (SD ¼ 10:68, 
sessions had a mean of 17 conversational 
Max ¼ 87, Min ¼ 5). N-gram analysis was used to investigate the 
characteristics of participants’ conversations with Emohaa. The 
most discussed keywords were found to be 感觉 (feeling; 33%), 工 
作 (work; 20%), 心情 (mood; 11%), 学习 (pressure; 10.5%), 朋友 
(friends; 9.2%), and 孩子 (children; 7.7%). Percentages indicate 
the proportion of conversations that included the keyword. The 
main problems that participants wanted to talk about were 工作 
环境 (Work environment), 工作压力 (Work pressure), 浪费时间 
(Wasting Time), 集中注意力 (Keeping focus), 牺牲休息时 
(Sacriﬁcing leisure time), and 转移注意力 (Diverted attention). In 
general, participants were mainly interested in 正念冥想 (Mindful 
meditation), 早点休息 (Resting early), 身体健康 (Being healthy), 
and 提供情绪价值 (Providing emotional value). 






After the end of the intervention, participants who had used 
Emohaa during the experiment were instructed to complete an 
additional survey to evaluate the agent’s performance. Most 
participants (60/69, 86.9%) reported that they had never received 
psychological counseling before the experiment, and only two 
had taken psychotropic medication. 
Initially, participants were asked to rate the CBT-Bot platform’s 
ease of use, provided content, and interface quality on a 10-point 
Likert scale. Most participants reported moderate to high levels 
of satisfaction (scores ranging from 7 to 10) with the platform’s 
functionality (56/69, 81.16%) and the designed exercises (47/69, 
68.12%). In addition, more than half of the participants (43/69, 
62.32%) were satisﬁed with the interface design. Overall, 
the 
majority (49/69, 71%) reported that they would recommend this 
platform to others. 
Similarly, participants who had used Emohaa’s ES-Bot 
platform were instructed to rate its performance. This platform 
was considered by most of the participants as an appropriate 
chatting partner (24/31, 77.42%) and channel 
for emotional 
venting (20/31, 64.5%), and more than half of the participants 
(18/31, 58.1%) reported that chatting with this platform made 
them feel heard. When asked about their expectations of the 
platform, the majority believed it to be a suitable companion for 
emotional 
that can accurately 
interpret their emotions and provide emotional counseling (21/ 
31, 67.74%). In addition, more than half of the participants were 
satisﬁed with the interface (20/31, 64.5%) and reported that they 
would recommend it to others (19/31, 61.3%). Independent t- 
tests showed that there was no signiﬁcant difference between 
participants’ satisfaction with the Emohaa CBT-Bot platform and 
ES-Bot platform (t ¼ 1:16; p ¼ 0:250). 

Lastly, participants were asked to provide feedback on their 
experience with Emohaa. Table 3 summarizes the most common 
frequently raised 
themes in the collected responses. The most 
concerns were technical issues, unclear instructions, and limited 
content and choices. The reported technical issues were mainly 
regarding the user interface (e.g., “Cannot click the next page” and 
“Accidentally closing the app removed all my progress”). Many 
participants were overwhelmed with the number of categories in 
the guided writing exercises and felt some topics were illogical and 
not applicable to real life. Participants also felt that the stories in

the automatic thinking exercises were excessive while there were 
not enough options to describe their mood and emotions after 
completing the exercise. Moreover, 
the 
dialogue options in the platform’s template were inadequate. 

Issues regarding the performance of the ES-Bot platform were 
also raised. Several participants reported that the conversations 
were rigid, and the system needed user guidance to continue the 
conversation. In some instances, the generated responses were

reported as 
Participants also highlighted the platform’s occasional inability to 
remember what had been said in the early stages of 
the 
conversation, initiate conversation topics, and understand various 
input types (i.e., audio, video, and image). 



In addition, participants were also asked to provide suggestions 
on how to improve Emohaa. As concerns regarding lack of content 
and options were mentioned, 
it was suggested that additional 
instructions, and options be included in the 
scenarios, stories, 
CBT-Bot platform. The importance of regularly updating the 
platform and promptly ﬁxing 
also 
highlighted. Regarding the ES-Bot platform, nearly half of the 
for 
participants 
making the generated responses less rigid were necessary. It was 
also suggested that support for different input types be added to 
create a more interactive and engaging experience. Many also 
recommending mental health-related content 
believed that 
during conversations and taking the initiative in conversations 
would beneﬁt this platform. 






The obtained results demonstrated Emohaa’s efﬁcacy as a 
short-term intervention for depression, negative affect, and 
insomnia. Based on the survey results, users experienced reduced 
levels of mental distress in the measured categories after using 
Emohaa. Compared to the control group, there was a signiﬁcant 
decrease 
in depression among the participants who used 
Emohaa, as measured by the PHQ-9 questionnaire. Similarly, as 
their 
measured by the PANAS and the ISI questionnaires, 
negative affect and insomnia were also considerably reduced. 
Therefore, as shown by the experimental results, Emohaa can be 
seen as an effective tool for mental health support. 

Regarding the difference in outcomes between the two groups 
that used Emohaa, no signiﬁcant differences were found in the 
term. Both interventions effectively relieved individuals’ 
short 
mental health symptoms. However, 
the 
supplemental analyses (Section 3.2.1), participants who used the 
ES-Bot platform showed comparatively fewer 
indicators of 
insomnia. This ﬁnding highlights a potential beneﬁt of emotional 
venting in improving problems regarding sleep in the long term. 
Based on the obtained feedback, most participants were 
satisﬁed with this agent and considered recommending it 
to 
others. In line with previous research (16, 17), the results of the 
conversation analysis indicated that participants were willing to 






self-disclose their emotional problems, as shown by their most 
discussed keywords and topics. Moreover, most participants 
considered Emohaa’s ES-Bot platform a chatting partner that can 
effectively listen to their problems and provide a channel for 
them to vent their emotions. Notably, the majority felt that this 
platform could understand their emotions, an essential feature of 
support and a crucial

limitations regarding its design and 
methodology. The study duration was limited; thus, only two 
assessments of participants’ mental distress were made. Although 
a follow-up screening for participants that had used Emohaa 
during the experiment was conducted, no data regarding the 
control group’s participants were gathered as they might have 
received other interventions after the initial two-week screening. 
Furthermore, 
in the 
follow-up survey is inadequate to draw a conclusion that the 
conversational agent (ES-Bot) is better than the CBT-Bot. Future 
studies would beneﬁt from collecting more data from the three 
groups in the follow-up surveys to support the complementary 
effects of generative dialogue platforms for emotional support. 




It is believed that the number of participants was sufﬁcient to 
demonstrate the preliminary effects of employing conversational 
agents for mental health support in theory. However, the sample 
size and the experiment duration are inadequate for generalizing 
study to the public. Future 
the obtained results of 
experiments will include a larger sample size and longer study 
duration to further ensure the generalizability of Emohaa’s 
effectiveness

engagement within machine-based interventions. 



Regarding the ES-Bot platform, several reported instances 
suggested that Emohaa forgets the information in previous turns 
and that the generated responses are irrelevant to the context, 
which could impair user engagement and rapport. This is a well- 
known issue in current language models (59), and the main 
reason could be the limited number of words in the model’s 
input (128 words for Emohaa). A feasible approach to address 
this issue is to add a module that could summarize the essential 
information of the previous turns in the conversation (60). In 
addition, previous work has demonstrated the beneﬁts of adding 
persona (61–63) and commonsense knowledge (64, 65) 
for 
improving user experience with generative conversational agents. 
Future work could explore these additions to study their efﬁcacy 
and corresponding improvements in mental health support.
