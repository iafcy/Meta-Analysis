Background: Motivation is a core component of diabetes self-management because it allows adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) 
to adhere to clinical recommendations. In this context, virtual coaches (VCs) have assumed a central role in supporting and 
treating common barriers related to adherence. However, most of them are mainly focused on medical and physical purposes, 
such as the monitoring of blood glucose levels or following a healthy diet. 
Objective: This proof-of-concept study aims to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of a VC intervention for psychosocial support 
before and after the intervention and at follow-up. The intent of this VC is to motivate adults with type 1 DM and type 2 DM to 
adopt and cultivate healthy coping strategies to reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and diabetes-related 
emotional distress, while also improving their well-being. 
Methods: A total of 13 Italian adults with DM (18-51 years) interacted with a VC, called Motibot (motivational bot) using the 
Telegram messaging app. The interaction covered 12 sessions, each lasting 10 to 20 minutes, during which the user could dialogue 
with the VC by inputting text or tapping an option on their smartphone screen. Motibot is developed within the transtheoretical 
model of change to deliver the most appropriate psychoeducational intervention based on the user’s motivation to change. 
Results: Results showed that over the 12 sessions, there were no significant changes before and after the intervention and at 
follow-up regarding psychosocial factors. However, most users showed a downward trend over the 3 time periods in depression 
and anxiety symptoms, thereby presenting good psychological well-being and no diabetes-related emotional distress. In addition, 
users felt motivated, involved, encouraged, emotionally understood, and stimulated by Motibot during the interaction. Indeed, 
the analyses of semistructured interviews, using a text mining approach, showed that most users reported a perceived reduction 
in anxiety, depression, and/or stress symptoms. Moreover, users indicated the usefulness of Motibot in supporting and motivating 
them to find a mindful moment for themselves and to reflect on their own emotions. 
Conclusions: Motibot was well accepted by users, particularly because of the inclusion of mindfulness practices, which motivated 
them to adopt healthy coping skills. To this extent, Motibot provided psychosocial support for adults with DM, particularly for 
those with mild and moderate symptoms, whereas those with severe symptoms may benefit more from face-to-face psychotherapy.

Background 
Physical, medical, and psychosocial factors significantly 
contribute to adherence rates to the clinical recommendations 
in adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) by promoting or hindering 
optimal diabetes self-management. Appropriate diabetes 
self-management is central to long-term diabetes care, and it 
includes several healthy behaviors, such as monitoring of 
glycemic levels, physical exercise, healthy eating, taking 
prescribed medication and/or insulin injections, which in turn 
have an impact on the general well-being of people with DM. 
However, these healthy behaviors are difficult to maintain. 
Indeed, 
levels of 
shown 
diabetes-emotional distress are associated with a worsening of 
self-care behaviors as well as glycemic 
[1]. 
Diabetes-emotional distress is also a risk factor for stress, 
anxiety, and depression symptoms. Indeed, the prevalence rates 
of depression are much higher in people with DM than in the 
general population, in which they are estimated to be 17% [1]. 
With regard to anxiety symptoms, studies have found that 14% 
of adults with DM show generalized anxiety disorder, a 
prevalence much higher than the 3% to 4% rate identified in a 
community sample [2-4]. Anxiety is related to unhealthy 
lifestyle choices, such as augmented smoking prevalence, 
assumption of food high in cholesterol, and a sedentary lifestyle, 
which can all lead to poor disease management [5]. In addition, 
higher levels of anxiety hinder cognitive capacity, which in turn 
influences diabetes management and thus the ability to fully 
follow clinical recommendations [1,5]. Similarly, feeling 
stressed determines the release of stress hormones, such as 
cortisol and adrenaline, which prevent insulin from working 
properly (ie, insulin resistance) and thus increases glycemic 
levels [6]. Depression, anxiety, and stress are associated with 
the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, and the presence 
of DM further increases this risk [1,5,6]. All together, these 
factors provoke lower adherence rates and impairment in the 
well-being of people with DM, leading to poor disease outcomes 
[7]. Therefore, one can assume the presence of a complex 
interplay between psychosocial 
factors and diabetes 
management, meaning that they influence one another. Thus, 
the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) 
guidelines introduced a healthy coping construct to identify 
healthy coping strategies to reduce these symptoms and improve 
the general well-being of adults with DM [8]. In particular, 
AADE suggests strategies to cope with life stresses and the 
challenges of managing DM, such as meditating [8]. Indeed, 
several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of mindfulness 
practices in emphasizing self-acceptance in the general 
population [9] and treating depressive symptoms in people with 
DM [10,11]. In this context, motivation is a core component in 
adherence to the diabetes regimen as it is specifically 
conceptualized for its process rather than for a specific goal 
[12]. Indeed, the transtheoretical model of change (TTMC) [13] 
defines motivation as a continuum rather than as an 
all-or-nothing construct, in which the individual can move across 
5 stages (ie, precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, 
action, and maintenance), thus moving forward or backward.

In this regard, digital health technologies play a central role in 
promoting health care, especially in chronic diseases. For 
instance, TTMC has been widely used in digital solutions to 
predict or evaluate behavioral changes in physical activity [14], 
diet [15], and glycemic control [16] and to ameliorate adherence 
to medications in adults with risk factors for the onset of 
cardiovascular diseases [17,18]. 
Virtual Coaches: User Engagement and User 
Experience 
The increasing rates of diabetes worldwide are a problem for 
the diabetologists treating diabetes, who already, as things stand, 
do not have enough time to assist every patient with physical, 
medical, and psychosocial issues. In this regard, virtual coaches 
(VCs) have become an increasingly relevant resource for the 
management of chronic diseases and for promoting behavioral 
changes in the self-management of individuals. Indeed, they 
aim to provide personalized guidance and improve intervention 
outcomes by mimicking human beings [19]. Indeed, VC in the 
health care field is mainly aimed at developing personalized 
user-system interactions and supporting individuals in their 
behavioral changes [20,21]. This is important for improving 
user engagement (UE) and compliance, both of which are crucial 
for achieving long-term behavioral changes and adjustment 
toward a healthier lifestyle [22]. UE is a multifaceted construct 
that refers to the quality of the user experience (UX), including 
the individual’s time, cognitive, affective, and behavioral 
investment during the interaction with a digital solution [23]. 
The UE construct goes beyond user satisfaction: indeed, the 
literature suggests that the capacity to engage and maintain 
engagement in the interaction with a digital solution seems to 
show positive results in eHealth, e-learning, and web searching 
[23]. Indeed, prolonged engagement has been shown to be 
promising in a diabetes prevention program with the use of VC 
[24], engaging 69% of adults for the whole study and resulting 
in 8.98% weight loss [24]. In addition, in 2 other recent studies, 
adults with type 2 DM (T2DM) [25] and young adults with type 
1 DM (T1DM) [26] reported feeling engaged and satisfied with 
a VC embedded in an application. In other studies, people with 
DM reported an increased level of satisfaction with the 
interaction with the VC [27,28]. Indeed, VCs for people with 
DM seem to favor self-care behaviors and behavioral changes 
as well as support them at follow-up. For instance, a recent 
review reported that VCs for people with DM represent effective 
interventions for fostering their glycemic control, in combination 
with standard care [29]. Therefore, VCs seem to be capable of 
overcoming common barriers related to adherence by delivering 
data-driven personalized support in real time and being available 
at any time during the day [30], thus allowing scalability. In 
this regard, UX is a crucial element that intersects the UE. 
Taking into consideration the definition proposed by the 
International Organization for Standardization [31], UX includes 
users’ engagement, pleasure, desirability, values, emotions, 
beliefs, preferences, perceptions, physical and psychological 
responses, behaviors, and accomplishments, which occur before, 
during, and after the use of a digital solution. The International 
Organization for Standardization also lists 3 factors that 
influence UX: the user’s current state and previous experience, 
[31]. Therefore, 
system properties, and use context 
JMIR Hum Factors 2022 | vol. 9 | iss. 1 | e32211 | p. 2 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


understanding users’ needs, their working environments, 
interactions, and emotional reactions can help design VCs from 
the UX point of view [31]. Thus, the user becomes an active 
contributor to this process [31]. Studies have shown that higher 
levels of UX have been associated with an increased 
targeting 
effectiveness of digital health 
improvements in T2DM self-management [25], physical activity 
[32], and diet [33]. However, there is a lack of evidence 
regarding UE and UX as constructs that interplay in the 
development, evaluation, and implementation of VCs for 
psychosocial support of adults with DM. 

Comparison With Previous Work 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to implement VC for 
psychosocial support in adults with T1DM and T2DM. 
Notwithstanding the originality of this work, in previous studies, 
VCs have been deployed to improve healthy coping strategies 
in college students, showing their beneficial effect in reducing 
symptoms of distress [34,35]. With regard to the development 
of VCs in the field of diabetes, studies have designed a 
conversational agent [36] and an interactive diary [37,38]. These 
digital interventions were both embedded in a smartphone app 
to improve health-related quality of life among adults with 
T2DM [35] and T1DM [37,38]. Health-related quality of life 
is an important and well-known construct that underlies the 
concept of general well-being. However, it should also be noted 
that anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms interplay with 
diabetes management. This means that these outcomes can 
hinder an individual’s ability to manage diabetes and maintain 
effective glycemic control. Hence, it is important to include 
these variables when developing programs and interventions 
for adults with DM. 
Objectives 
Bearing all these aspects in mind, this VC (Motivational 
bot—Motibot) aims to support and motivate adults with T1DM 
and T2DM to adopt healthy coping strategies. In turn, these 
healthy coping strategies should reduce depression, anxiety, 
perceived stress symptoms, and diabetes-related emotional 
distress and improve well-being. Therefore, the aim of this 
proof-of-concept study was threefold: 
1. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the VC intervention 
before and after the intervention and at follow-up in 
reducing the abovementioned psychosocial symptoms while 
also improving the well-being of adults. 
2. To investigate UX and UE with the VC for psychosocial 
support accessed through personal smartphones within the 
Telegram messaging app. 



Participants and Recruitment 
The study involved 18 voluntary adults with T1DM and T2DM 
recruited in Italy via social network sites (ie, Facebook groups) 
using snowball sampling. Five adults dropped out of the study 
for personal and medical reasons. Therefore, the final sample 
included 13 adults aged between 18 and 51 years (mean 30.08, 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
SD 10.61 years), 77% (10/13) of which were women; 62% 
(8/13) of adults had T1DM and 39% (5/13) had T2DM, with 
an overall mean diabetes duration of 10 (SD 8.49) years. One 
participant did not complete the psychological measures after 
the intervention and was therefore excluded from the analyses 
of the psychosocial variables. The inclusion criteria for 
participating in this study were as follows: (1) having T1DM 
or T2DM and (2) owning a smartphone and a Telegram account. 
The decision to include both types of DM was guided by the 
notion that there are similarities between the lifestyle guidelines 
for adults with T1DM and T2DM, as emerged from the results 
of a recent meta-analysis [39]. Participants were excluded if 
they had gestational diabetes or prediabetes. 
Procedure and Ethics 
This work is a proof-of-concept study for adults with T1DM 
and T2DM, conducted following the Obesity-Related Behavioral 
Intervention Trials (ORBIT) framework [40]. The ORBIT model 
supported guidance throughout the whole process as it 
emphasizes the importance of adopting a data-driven iterative 
approach to optimize subsequent iterations of the intervention 
[40]. In particular, this model places the user at the center of 
the design process. The study was conducted in compliance 
with the Declaration of Helsinki (Italian law 196/2003, European 
Union General Data Protection Regulation 679/2016). The 
Interdepartmental Ethical Committee of Psychology of the 
University of Padova (Italy) approved the project (approval 
number: 3968; February 3, 2021), stating that there were no 
critical ethical issues. The participants signed a written informed 
consent sent via mail, agreeing to participate in the study and 
semistructured interviews 1 month after the end of the study. 
They were informed that their data would be confidential, that 
they could omit any information they did not wish to give, and 
that they could withdraw from the study at any moment without 
having to provide any explanation. 
Intervention Description: Motibot Design 
Motibot (Figure 1) is a VC designed to provide psychosocial 
support by motivating adults with DM to adopt and cultivate 
healthy coping strategies, which, according to the AADE 
guidelines, should be flexible and adaptable to the users’ needs 
[8]. These coping strategies, in turn, should foster adults’ 
well-being by reducing depression, anxiety, and perceived stress 
symptoms and diabetes-related emotional distress. Motibot was 
developed by the Digital Health Lab at Fondazione Bruno 
Kessler Research Center for Digital Health and Wellbeing using 
Rasa [41], an open-source platform designed for 
the 
development and training of VCs. It was then deployed through 
the Telegram messaging app. The environment provided by 
Rasa exploits machine learning (ML) libraries and pretrained 
embeddings from 
the 
language models, 
construction of a VC for a specific language by combining ML 
approaches and handcrafted rules. Motibot relies on natural 
language understanding (NLU) [42], which is an ML technique 
that enables the VC to interpret user messages. NLU, together 
with the conversational history and a set of predefined variables, 
determines the transition from one turn of the dialogue to 
another. In this study, the NLU system was trained by feeding 
it with a data set comprising 6899 examples of user utterances 

JMIR Hum Factors 2022 | vol. 9 | iss. 1 | e32211 | p. 3 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


categorized by intent and annotated with entities. Examples of 
intents are to affirm, deny, say your name, say what you feel, 
schedule the next meeting, and xpress the level of motivatione. 
Examples of entities are the user’s name, the emotion felt, the 
date, time of the next meeting, and level of motivation. NLU 
was used to interpret the intents and entities. In this study, we 
defined 54 intents and 6 entities. During interactions between 
Motibot and users, intents and entities were extracted from 
users’ messages and classified using a trained multitask 
transformer architecture. Motibot was designed to last for 12 
sessions of 10-20 minutes each, during which Motibot interacted 
with the user according to the scripts previously defined as 
shown in Figure 2. Because of the flexibility of this VC, 
specifically designed to be as adaptable as possible to the users’ 
daily life, every session was initiated following a scheduled 
plan decided by the users themselves to best suit their needs. 
Users were able to respond to Motibot by inputting text or 
tapping an option on their smartphone screen. The interaction 
is designed considering 
between Motibot and users 
evidence-based approaches 
to counseling and 
psychoeducation as displayed in Figure 2. In particular, these 
approaches are linked to the healthy coping construct [8] and 
to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [43] to support and 
motivate the development and/or enhancement of coping 
strategies. For these reasons, the whole conversational protocol 
was developed referring to TTMC [13], which allows the VC 
to understand what motivational state the user is in and 


consequently deliver the most appropriate psychoeducation 
intervention, which is based on the user’s motivation to change. 
At the beginning of the first session, Motibot asks the users to 
present themselves by telling they are. Subsequently, Motibot 
delivers a video presentation of itself, its functionality, and its 
main features to involve the user in the interaction. Thereupon, 
Motibot delivers 3 different questionnaires to assess the levels 
of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) [44], 
anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]) [45], and 
perceived stress symptoms (Perceived Stress Scale-10 [PSS-10]) 
[46]. These 3 questionnaires were also sent after the intervention 
and at follow-up. In this last case, 2 psychosocial scales were 
added to assess diabetes-related emotional distress (Problem 
Areas in Diabetes Scale–Short Form-5 [PAID-5]) [47] and 
general well-being (World Health Organization-5 Well-Being 
Index [WHO-5]) [48]. PAID-5 and WHO-5 were evaluated only 
at follow-up, that is, 2 months after the end of the study. The 
latter 2 scales were included to verify whether coping strategies 
had been internalized, thus leading to greater well-being. Indeed, 
diabetes self-management is well known to be influenced by 
these outcomes. In addition, Motibot sent 2 other questionnaires 
to assess UX during the whole interaction and UE only at the 
end of the intervention to comprehend the users’ overall and 
final involvement. One month after the end of the study, 
semistructured interviews were conducted to understand both 
UX and how users felt during their interaction with Motibot.

Scale; UX: user experience; WHO5: The World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index. 
Each day, Motibot asks the users what emotion they are feeling 
at that precise moment as well as its intensity, to support them 
in becoming more aware of their own emotions and 
self-reflecting on them. After this question, according to TTMC 
and following the state of change ruler (ie, precontemplation 
state, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance) [13], 
Motibot asks users “How much do you want to improve your 
well-being on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much)?” to 
understand their motivation to maintain diabetes under control. 
When users are considered in the precontemplation state, 
Motibot tries to investigate why they feel this way and then 
attempts to increase emotional awareness by helping them to 
self-reflect on their emotions and on the importance of taking 
care of both their body and mind. When users are considered

Data Collection 
As reported in Textbox 1, the psychosocial questionnaires were 
administered before and after the intervention and at follow-up. 
Moreover, semistructured interviews were conducted 1 month 
after the end of the study. 
in the contemplation state, Motibot provides motivational 
interventions, which focus the attention on the costs and benefits 
of adopting a healthier behavior to favor psychosocial 
well-being. Finally, when users are in the action state, Motibot 
provides behavioral interventions by sending audio tracks related 
to mindfulness practices. 






































The PHQ-9 [44] is a brief self-reported unidimensional measure 
developed to assess and monitor the severity of depression 
symptoms in the previous 2 weeks. The questionnaire includes 
9 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale (from 0 never to 3 almost 
every day). The PHQ-9, which incorporates the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text 
revision criteria, has a total score ranging from 0 to 27, with a 
score of 10 representing the optimal cutoff to detect clinically 
relevant depression. The PHQ-9 comprises five categories of 
severity: (1) absent (scores 0-4), (2) subthreshold depression 
(scores 5-9), (3) mild depression (scores 10-14), (4) moderate 
depression (scores 15-19), and (5) major depression (scores 
20-27). An example of an item is the following: “During the 
last two weeks, on how many days did you feel little interest or 
pleasure in doing things?” (item 1). The PHQ-9 has shown good 
psychometric properties [44]. The GAD-7 [45] is a brief 
self-reported unidimensional measure aimed at screening 
probable cases of GAD and assessing the severity of symptoms 
in the previous 2 weeks. The questionnaire comprises 7 items 
based on a 4-point Likert scale (from 0 never to 3 almost every 
day). The GAD-7 incorporates the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision criteria 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
and has a total score ranging from 0 to 21, with a score of 10 
as the cutoff for GAD. The questionnaire included three 
categories of severity: (1) mild anxiety symptoms (score ≥5), 
(2) moderate anxiety symptoms (score ≥10), and (3) severe 
anxiety symptoms (score ≥15). An example of an item is the 
following: “In the last two weeks, how often did each of the 
following problems bother you? Feeling nervous, anxious, or 
tense” (item 1). The GAD-7 has demonstrated good validity 
and reliability [45]. The PSS-10 [46] is a brief self-reported 
unidimensional measure that assesses an individual’s perception 
of stress in the previous month. The PSS is a measure of the 
degree to which each situation in one’s life is perceived as 
stressful; indeed, the items are designed to evaluate the degree 
lives unpredictable, 
to which 
uncontrollable, or overloaded. The scale also contains a series 
of direct questions about the current levels of perceived stress. 
The PSS consists of 10 items based on a 4-point Likert scale 
(from 0 never to 5 very often). The total PSS score ranges from 
0 to 40, with high scores indicating a high level of perceived 
stress. PSS includes three categories of severity: (1) low 
perception of stress (scores 0-13), (2) moderate perception of 
stress (scores 14-26), and (3) high perception of stress (scores

(page number not for citation purposes) 


27-40). An example of an item is the following: “In the last 
month, how often have you felt out of sorts because something 
unexpected happened?” (item 1). The PSS-10 has demonstrated 
good psychometric properties regarding reliability and validity 
[46]. The PAID-SF-5 [47] is a self-reported unidimensional 
measure aimed at assessing diabetes-related emotional distress. 
The questionnaire comprises 5 items based on a 5-point Likert 
scale (from 0 not a problem to 4 serious problem). Total scores 
range from 0 to 100, with higher scores (ie, ≥40) indicating 
greater diabetes-related emotional distress. The PAID-SF-5 has 
demonstrated good psychometric properties [47]. The WHO-5 
[48] is a self-reported unidimensional measure that evaluates 
psychological well-being, a core dimension of quality of life. 
The questionnaire comprises 5 items rated on a 6-point Likert 
scale (from 0 never to 5 always). The total score was rescaled 
to range between 0 and 100, with a score ≤50 suggesting poor 
psychological well-being and a score ≤28, indicating depression, 
showing good psychometric properties [48]. The User 
Engagement Scale–Short Form (UES-SF) [49] is a brief 
self-report questionnaire aimed at assessing user engagement 
with a digital solution. The UES-SF includes 12 items based 
on a 5-point Likert scale (from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly 
agree). The UES-SF comprises 4 factors: (1) focused attention, 
which indicates the feeling of being immersed in the interaction 
(eg, “I lost myself in this experience”); (2) perceived usability, 
which is the negative affect experienced owing to the interaction 
and the effort spent (eg, “I felt frustrating while using 
Motibot”)—this factor is the only one in which the scores were 
reversed; (3) aesthetic appeal, which represents the graphical 
and visual appeal related to the digital solution (eg, “Motibot 
was aesthetically appealing”); and (4) the reward factor (eg, 
“Using Motibot was worthwhile”). The latter is a single set of 
3 factors related to the original UES questionnaire [49,50], such 
as the endurability, which evaluates the overall success of the 
interaction; the novelty, which examines the overall interest 
related to the interaction with a digital solution; and finally, the 
felt involvement factor, which evaluates the overall fun 
interaction. The overall scale was found to be reliable [49]. The 
User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) used in this study is an 
adapted version of the original UEQ [51], modified ad hoc to 
make the bipolar adjectives more appropriate to the aims of this 
study. In particular, the questionnaire included 28 adjectives, 
either positive or negative, designed to assess the experience of 
interacting with the VC. Each item was scored on a 5-point 
Likert scale (from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree). 
Textbox 2 shows the selection of items for this study.

Semistructured interviews were conducted by GB with all 
participants who concluded the interaction with Motibot. The 
interviews were based on 11 ad hoc questions administered 1 
month after the end of the study and lasted approximately 10 
minutes. Each interview started with asking the motivation for 
participating in this study and concluded with a question in 
which the participant should explain whether they would suggest 
Motibot to other people with the same chronic illness, explaining 
the reason. The other 9 questions were divided into 2 sections 
as reported in Textbox 3. The first included 5 questions related 
to the experience that users had with Motibot; therefore, the 
goal was to assess the UX. On the other hand, the second section 
included 4 questions related to how users felt during the 
interaction with Motibot from a psychological perspective.

Statistical Analysis 
Statistical analyses were performed using R, version 4.0.0 (The 
R Foundation for Statistical Computing) [52], and SPSS 
Statistics, version 24.0 (IBM Corp) [53]. The Shapiro-Wilk test 
was performed to evaluate the normality of the sample 
distributions of the variables investigated in this study. 
Descriptive analysis was carried out on psychological 
dimensions, namely depression, anxiety, and perceived stress, 
before and after the intervention and at follow-up. The same 
analysis was performed on diabetes-related emotional distress 
and well-being, although only at follow-up. All data are shown 
as plots. The Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test was used to 
evaluate differences in depression, anxiety, and stress among 
participants. A post hoc Wilcoxon nonparametric test was 
performed to compare the differences in the aforementioned 
outcomes before and after the intervention and at follow-up to 
understand whether the psychoeducational intervention had 
been effective. Means and SDs were computed for UX, which 
was evaluated at the 4th, 8th, and 12th sessions and for UE, 
which was evaluated at the end of the study. The data regarding 
UX are displayed as plots. A text mining approach [54,55] was 
followed to extract information from the semistructured 
interviews on UX and on how users felt during the interaction 
with Motibot. This analysis was implemented by relying on the 
Quanteda R package [56] and on custom shell scripting code 
under a Linux environment. The analysis was carried out on 
the written interview transcripts (in Italian) as follows: first, 
they were cleaned by replacing uppercase letters and removing 
numbers, punctuation, and stopwords. Thereupon, user’s 
answers were divided into groups, each containing all answers 
to one of the interview questions. Two analyses steps were 
implemented: (1) extraction, from some of the questions in the 
interviews, of 3 sets of responses (ie, 
semistructured 
yes/no/maybe) and (2) extraction, from the remaining questions, 
of recurrent concepts (ie, word stems) and their relations in 
terms of digrams (ie, pairs of word stems). A word stem was 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
deemed to be recurrent if it appeared at least three times across 
interviews, whereas digrams were considered recurrent if they 
appeared at least two times. The criterion of 3 occurrences as 
the threshold for including a stem was chosen according to the 
following rule of thumb. We assume stems to be significant if 
they belong to the 5% most recurrent ones. However, because 
occurrence is quantified by an integer number, this percentile 
threshold can be enforced only approximately. Setting the 
criterion of minimum occurrences to 3 yielded the extraction, 
for the different questions, between 3.8% and 7.9% most 
recurrent stems (average 6.2%), in reasonable compliance with 
the 5% threshold assumed above. In addition, the average 
occurrence of stems for a given question was 1.35; a threshold 
of 3 occurrences was equivalent to the requirement of a stem 
recurring more than twice as frequently as the average. 

Preliminary Analysis 
The variables investigated in this study showed a nonnormal 
distribution. No missing data were identified, and each 
participant answered all the questions administered. As 
mentioned in the Participant section, only one participant did 
not answer the entire questionnaire sent after the intervention 
and thus was excluded from the analyses regarding the 
psychosocial variables. 
Perceived Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Symptoms 
Overall, as displayed in Figure 3, all participants showed 
moderate symptoms concerning perceived stress (assessed using 
the PSS-10). Participant 6 was the only participant showing a 
high perception of stress after the intervention; however, the 
level of perceived stress diminished at follow-up. Data 
concerning anxiety and depression symptoms (assessed 
respectively through the GAD-7 and PHQ-9) seem to increase 
after the intervention and decrease at follow-up, except for 
participant 5, who presented severe symptoms at both time

Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively, before and after intervention and at follow-up (N=12). 
Well-being and Diabetes-Related Emotional Distress 
As shown in Figure 4, when considering the presence of an 
outlier, participants 
ranged between poor and good 
psychological well-being (assessed through the WHO-5), with 
an overall mean of 50.00 (SD 17.18), which indicates an overall 
poor psychological well-being. However, if the outlier is 
excluded, the overall mean is 51.64 (SD 17.01), which 
corresponds to an overall good psychological well-being. With 
regard to diabetes-related emotional distress (assessed through 
the PAID-5), most participants did not present diabetes-related 
emotional distress; indeed, the overall mean was 35.67 (SD 
21.20). If the approach described above is applied and therefore 
if the outlier is excluded, the overall mean is 32.73 (SD 19.50), 
which, being an even smaller value, suggests low levels of 
diabetes-related emotional distress.

Kruskal-Wallis Test for Psychosocial Outcomes 
The Kruskal-Wallis test, carried out to assess the differences 
among depression, anxiety, and perceived stress symptoms, did 
not yield any significant results when considering the 
intervention period. Nevertheless, as shown in Figure 3, a 
downward trend can be identified over the 3 time periods (ie, 
before the intervention, after the intervention, and during 
follow-up). 
User Experience 
Analyses regarding the positive items (assessed through UEQ) 
reported a mean >3 on a 5-point Likert scale (mean 4.04, SD 
0.22). In particular, the items comprehensible language, 
empathetic, motivating, encouraging, and interesting increased 
from the 2nd to the 12th session, whereas the item supportive 
tended to decrease from the 2nd to the 12th session as displayed 
in Figure 5. The specific means and SDs are reported in the 
Multimedia Appendix 1 (Table S1). 
Analyses of the negative items (evaluated using UEQ), shown 
in Figure 6, reported a mean <2 on a 5-point Likert scale (mean 
1.86, SD 0.30), thereby attesting that users disagreed with the 
overall items. In particular, the items not stimulating, not 
engaging, and rigid decreased from the 2nd to the 12th session. 
The specific means and SDs are reported in the Multimedia 
Appendix 1 (Table S2).

User Engagement 
Overall, the data on UE show that participants were engaged 
with Motibot, as reported in Table 1. The reward factor, which 
refers to the worthwhile and absorbing experience of the user 
with the digital solution, presents a maximum value of 5. The 
same result also emerged for perceived usability and focused 
attention. Notably, the perceived usability factor is the only 
factor in which the items were reversed, indicating a good effect 
experienced by the digital solution.

Text Mining 
Overall, the average duration of the 13 semistructured interviews 
was 9.04 minutes. The transcripts of the interview answers 
comprised 562 words on average. The results of text mining 
applied to the answers of the semistructured interviews, 
concerning UX and how users felt during the interaction with 
Motibot, are graphically summarized in Figures 7 and 8, 
respectively. In both figures, bar plots show the distribution of 
3 types of answers (ie, yes/no/maybe), whereas scatter plots 
highlight the most frequent concepts, namely word stems 
appearing at least three times in the interviews. Within scatter 
plots, arrows identify recurrent digrams, that is, sequences of 
2-word stems appearing at least twice within the interviews. It 
is worth mentioning that the apparently opposite ordering of 
some digrams (eg, support→psychological) is because of the 
analysis being carried out on texts in Italian, in which word 
ordering is different from English. Stems were translated at the 
end of the analysis, considering the abovementioned potential 
nuances between the 2 languages. The radius of the circle is 
proportional to the number of occurrences of each stem.

Text Mining: UX With Motibot 
As shown in Figure 7, 85% (11/13) of the participants would 
be interested in using a VC for psychosocial support and 92% 
(12/13) would suggest VC to other people with the same chronic 
disease. Overall, participants reported having a positive 
experience with Motibot. As displayed in the upper-right panel, 
where stems graphed in blue and red correspond to liked and 
disliked aspects, respectively, users largely reported positive 
aspects in the interaction with Motibot, except for some 
technical problems. It should be mentioned that 3 participants 
reported that there were no aspects that they disliked. 
Text Mining: How Users Felt During the Interaction 
With Motibot? 
As displayed in Figure 8, users reported mindfulness audio 
tracks as a very good, positive, interesting, and new experience. 
They further considered the voice of the audio tracks as a guide 
to the mindfulness pathway. Indeed, 62% (8/13) of the 
participants also listened to the mindfulness audio again after 
the end of the study or planned to do so in the future, to grant 
themselves a further mindful moment. Finally, 77% (10/13) of 
the participants reported that Motibot helped them reduce the 
symptoms of anxiety, depression, and/or stress. 

Principal Findings 
This proof-of-concept study evaluated the preliminary efficacy 
of a VC intervention for psychosocial support. Motibot, indeed, 
aims to support and motivate adults with T1DM and T2DM to 
adopt healthy coping strategies. In turn, these healthy coping 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
strategies should reduce depression, anxiety, perceived stress 
symptoms, and diabetes-related emotional distress and improve 
well-being. This study further aims to evaluate UX and UE in 
the interaction with a VC from both qualitative and quantitative 
perspectives. Overall, preliminary evidence suggests that the 
digital intervention led to improvements in symptoms of anxiety 
and depression, as emerged from the downward trend of the 
related factors detected over the 3 time periods (ie, before the 
intervention, after the intervention, and during follow-up). 
Notably, participants showed an increase in anxiety and 
depression symptoms after the intervention and a subsequent 
decrease during follow-up, showing good psychological 
well-being, upon exclusion of an outlier, and no diabetes-related 
emotional distress. These data highlight how the effects of the 
psychoeducational intervention were maintained over time, thus 
leading to the users’ internalization of healthy coping strategies 
and self-reflection of their own emotions. With regard to 
perceived stress, users showed moderate symptoms, which 
remained throughout the intervention, including follow-up. 
However, users did not present any diabetes-related emotional 
distress. These findings shed light on the possible stressful 
events that underpin perceived stress, such as the impact of 
contingent events; thus, the findings did not relate to the burden 
of managing DM. It is worth mentioning that this study was 
carried out in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, which had 
a significant impact on psychological well-being among the 
whole population [57]. Overall, the users perceived a decrease 
in any symptoms of anxiety, depression, and/or stress, reporting 
the usefulness of Motibot in supporting and motivating them 
to find a mindful moment for themselves. The psychoeducational 
intervention was well accepted by users, particularly in the 
presence of a mindfulness pathway. Indeed, users reported a 
JMIR Hum Factors 2022 | vol. 9 | iss. 1 | e32211 | p. 14 
(page number not for citation purposes) 


very good, positive, interesting, and new experience: most users 
listened to the audio tracks even at the end of the study to 
achieve a mindful moment for themselves once again. Indeed, 
mindfulness-based interventions have recently become more 
relevant in the context of DM care, as they are associated with 
a reduction of negative emotions and an enhancement of an 
individual’s attitude and coping strategies [58]. Users had a 
positive and interesting experience with Motibot, particularly 
because it proposed audio tracks relating to meditation and 
asked them what emotion they were feeling in that precise 
moment. The purpose of asking users to express their emotions 
is to motivate them to become more aware and reflect on them: 
one might expect that the more one is aware of their own 
emotions, the better they can regulate them. Motibot was 
perceived as empathetic and stimulating in its dialogic 
interaction, even if it was slightly less supportive from the 2nd 
to the 12th session. This last result might indicate that users 
become familiar with Motibot throughout the sessions and thus 
do not perceive any further support, albeit still feeling involved 
and absorbed in the interaction. However, Motibot was also 
perceived as motivating and encouraging in the adoption of 
healthy coping strategies: users appreciated that Motibot gave 
them positive advice. Notwithstanding these promising results, 
few users still reported a desire for human contact to receive 
psychological support. These data emerged particularly for those 
who presented with high levels of anxiety, depression, and/or 
perceived stress symptoms. Therefore, we speculate that VCs 
may be successfully used to support and motivate people with 
mild and moderate psychological symptoms, whereas those 
with more severe psychological symptoms may benefit more 
from psychotherapy support in face-to-face spontaneous and 
human settings. Furthermore, users encountered technical 
problems when interacting with Motibot, particularly when 
arranging the next session. However, this issue was addressed 
in the study. Nonetheless, users felt involved and engaged with 
Motibot, reporting a worthwhile and absorbing experience and 
a positive perception of use, stating that Motibot was very easy 
to use. 
Limitations and Future Work 
This study has 2 main limitations. First, the small sample size, 
which was chosen following the proof-of-concept phase related 
to the ORBIT model, as it allows the inclusion of few 
participants during the first phases of the design, evaluation, 
and implementation process [40]. However, this choice does 
not permit data generalization. Second, a more complex analysis 
approach concerning text mining on the semistructured 
interviews, such as supervised or unsupervised learning, could 
not be implemented owing to the relatively small number of 
participants and the limited length of the interviews (ie, between 
approximately 200 and 1000 words each). Future studies should 
integrate, in the development of a VC, medical factors such as 
the glycemic levels alongside the main psychosocial aspects, 
as they interplay with the management of DM and thus are 
variables worth analyzing. Finally, our future goal is to test 
Motibot with a larger sample size in a randomized controlled 
trial to investigate the effectiveness of the psychoeducational 
intervention in a systematic and controlled manner. 
Conclusions 
Motibot was developed through a combination of NLU and 
handcrafted rules with the aim of delivering a psychoeducational 
intervention for adults with T1DM and T2DM, which allows 
them to interact by using both free text and structured dialogue 
interaction. The results of this study showed positive user 
experience and engagement. In addition, the findings highlighted 
the usefulness of interacting with a VC to motivate adults with 
DM to adopt healthy coping strategies. These coping strategies, 
specifically related to mindfulness practices, allowed a reduction 
in anxiety, depression, and diabetes-related emotional distress 
symptoms, while also improving their well-being. This decrease 
in psychosocial symptoms and increase in well-being was also 
maintained at follow-up. VCs have the advantage of scalability, 
which leads to greater user accessibility, and thus, it is available 
at any time. Moreover, VCs are deployable to adults with DM 
who show mild and moderate psychosocial symptoms. In 
particular, VCs can provide them with valuable support, in 
combination with a dedicated psychotherapist both in a 
traditional face-to-face setting or in a digital solution referring 
to the stepped care model [59].
