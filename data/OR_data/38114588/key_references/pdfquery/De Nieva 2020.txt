ABSTRACT 
The amount of academic workload in schools can cause students 
to experience stress and become more susceptible to mental health 
problems. However, because of fear of societal stigma, students 
may find it more difficult to approach others about the stress they 
experience. A chatbot can provide an alternative avenue for stu- 
dents to freely share the stressful situations they are experiencing. 
In this study, we investigated the use of Woebot as a mechanism 
to help senior high school students alleviate stress from academic 
workload. 25 participants who engaged in daily conversations with 
Woebot for a two-week period rated the chatbot’s likeness to a 
human with a mean score of 5.56 out of 8, while its ability to un- 
derstand the feelings of the participants and empathize with them 
had a mean score of 5.61. An analysis of the chat logs showed that 
the participants valued Woebot’s lessons and stories while they 
faced challenges in cases when the chatbot generated inappropriate 
responses. We discuss our findings and provide design suggestions 
that could make conversational agents like Woebot be more useful 
in helping the general student population cope with stress.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Stress is the human body’s natural response to daily pressures and 
threats to one’s well-being, whether such threat is real or imag- 
ined [13]. Negative stress, or distress, occurs when one feels over- 
whelmed and is unable to cope with the pressures from situations 
or life events that have become unmanageable [4, 21]. Short-term 
symptoms of stress include decreased attention and concentration, 
difficulty in making decisions, challenges with interpersonal re- 
lationships [20, 42], and continued feelings of fear or anger [40]. 
Overtime, these symptoms can lead to anxiety and depression. 
For senior high school students, the overwhelming amount of 
academic workload and the expectations for good academic per- 
formance may cause them to experience a type of distress called 
academic stress [25, 35]. These students may not realize that their 
symptoms are caused by a mental health condition or may not 
acknowledge that they need help. Various interventions are avail- 
able to help individuals become aware of their condition and to 
begin managing their stress, foremost of which is talking to family 
members or trusted friends. However, students tend to avoid ap- 
proaching others regarding their stress or to seek therapy from a 
health care provider because of fear of social stigma [7, 23, 34]. 
Recent approaches have seen the utilization of technologies to 
foster coping skills for managing stress and to promote emotional 
well-being and mental health among students. These include the 
use of online apps and podcasts to participate in online stress man- 
agement classes and self-help programs [22], and access to online 
social therapy through synchronous text-based counselling [10], 
online mental health forums [30] and chat assistants [7]. These 
technologies provide mental health services and support through 
prevention, assessment, diagnosis, counseling and treatment pro- 
grams [3]. Wearable technologies such as Garmin Vivosport and 
Apple Watch, mobile apps like Headspace, and even video games 
[29] are also used to manage, monitor and cope with stress. 
One particular technology that has the potential in addressing 
students’ stress-related concerns is the chatbot. A chatbot is an 
artificial intelligence software that is capable of conversing with 
humans through voice and text interfaces. They are accessible any- 
time and anywhere, in web sites, mobile applications and messaging 
platforms, thus presenting the potential benefit to students as a 
conversational partner. Chatbots may serve as an intermediate sup- 
plement for human interaction. They never get tired and never give 
in to their emotions. With chatbots, students no longer have to fear 
the social stigma associated with mental health symptoms and their 
concerns on privacy, allowing them to comfortably approach their 
stress with the help of the conversational agent. 



Senior High School (SHS) students find themselves in a more 
competitive environment with new responsibilities to fulfill their 
academic requirements. It is a milestone that transitions them from 
dependency to self-reliance in preparation for tertiary education. 
They encounter new classmates coming from differing backgrounds 
and University professors with heightened expectations than their 
junior high instructors. These changes can cause stress which they 
need to manage in order to perform well in school. In this research, 
we investigated the perceived effectiveness of chatbots among SHS 
students who used Woebot [12] as their conversational partner for 
a 2-week period. Our findings provide insights into the students’ 
experiences in using Woebot to share and to cope with their daily 
stress due to school-related activities. 
2 RELATED WORK 
Stress is a normal part of daily human experience as the body’s 
natural defense against pressures in life. Any physical, chemical or 
psychological factor that causes bodily or mental tensions can also 
constitute itself as stress [45]. Stress can have positive and negative 
effects. Exposure to positive stress can increase one’s performance 
and productivity. Extended exposure to stress, however, can lead to 
physiological dysfunction [22]. 
Seward [40] classified stress into three types: eustress, neustress 
and distress. Eustress is a positive stress that motivates or inspires 
people to continue working. Neustress is neither positive nor nega- 
tive. When stress reaches the point where it is no longer manageable, 
distress begins to manifest. Distress is a negative stress that can 
cause harm to one’s physical and emotional states. Tension starts 
to build up and a feeling of discomfort or irritability arises. A per- 
son in distress may generally exhibit the following characteristics: 
irritability, touchiness, easily startled, over-arousal, tense, inability 
to relax, and impatient [45]. 
In the following sections, we describe a type of stress, called 
academic stress, that is typically experienced by students due to 
their workload in schools. We also give an overview of the most 
common type of therapy offered as a form of intervention and 
support, the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We then look at 
various chatbots that have been designed as companion or social 
bots to provide emotional support to their human users. 
2.1 Academic Stress 
Multiple academic demands such as assignments, examinations, 
projects and other requirements, combined with the pressures from 
home and school environments, interpersonal relationships, social 
and extra-curricular activities, may exceed not only the cognitive 
load but also the emotional capacities of students. Being overloaded 
with school work and frustration over academic failure, students 
can become more prone to symptoms of academic distress [18]. 
Freshwater [13] classified distress into acute, episodic acute and 
chronic. Acute distress is predominated by negative thoughts from 
recent events or upcoming situations that need to be fulfilled. Fre- 
quent acute stress can lead to episodic acute stress where one feels 
pressure from taking on many responsibilities. Symptoms include 
irritability, anger, anxiety, impatience and depression. As a person 
feels hopeless and unable to find a way to escape from the causes 
of distress, he/she ceases to seek answers with regards to his/her 
problems. Chronic stress can then manifest which can severely de- 
teriorate the mental health of an individual. 
A study by Bhargava and Trivedi [2] among 300 students showed 
that academic tests, relationship problems, life changes and career 
exploration were the main causes of academic stress. A study by [1] 
among 1120 students using the Modified Educational Stress Scale 
found that students who were academically stressed were 2.4 times 
more likely to get depression than those who did not. 
Academic stress can also bring positive effects as a way to moti- 
vate students to do better on academic requirements and tests, to 
achieve their fullest potential, and to teach them how to react and 
come up with the best solutions during stressful situations [11]. 
2.2 Interventions and Support 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can reduce stress by changing 
the way we think about stressful situations, such as "focusing on 
more positive aspects of a situation and reassessing what their likely 
impact might be" [21, 27, 44]. In a clinical counseling session, De 
Kooker [8] reports that a therapist helps his/her patients manage 
their stressors (causes of their stress) by helping them recognize and 
deal with psychosocial factors. This can lead to the development of 
a range of personal coping skills to manage stress and reduce one’s 
vulnerability to anxiety and depression [22]. 

Behavioral Therapy (CBT) as a supplement to face-to-face therapy 
sessions to help reduce symptoms of depression [32, 41]. Combined 
with social network support, these technologies can lead to the 
development of supportive relationships and help lessen feelings 
of isolation among the youth [26]. 
The moderated online social therapy (MOST) project [7] has 
investigated the effect of online social therapy in increasing the 
self-esteem of young people. The project delivers a therapeutic envi- 
ronment for learning and practicing therapeutic techniques, gaining 
perspectives and obtaining support and validation through peers 
and developing psychological skills. MOST adopts the strengths- 
based model of psychotherapy combined with online moderators 
and the interactive delivery of engaging therapeutic content. Spe- 
cific features of the system include a Facebook-style newsfeed 
of shared posts, talking points that encourage social interaction 
through discussion and sharing of experiences, shared problem- 
solving, and performing behavioral experiments that allow one 
to practice applying mindfulness, self-compassion and personal 
strengths in real-world contexts. 
2.3 Chatbots for Emotional Support 
Chatbots and conversational agents have benefited different fields 
including healthcare [19] and mental health [16, 33, 39]. They can 
scale quickly to enable increased access to health services amidst the 
shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived 
stigma and growing mental health challenges [17]. Empathic and 
AI-enabled, chatbots have been used to provide supplementary or 
complementary emotion support and assistance. Various studies 
that analyzed their use reported the promise that conversational 
agents hold as interventions for the treatment of mental health 
problems in terms of efficacy and acceptability [14, 17]. 



Replika [28] is a virtual assistant and a digital companion bot. 
While it cannot answer information-seeking questions and perform 
simple commands that are typically exhibited by commercial voice 
assistants like Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, it 
has the ability to emote and to ask questions that can get users to 
open up and share what they feel [28]. A daily conversation with 
Replika starts with the chatbot asking what the user did during 
the day, to narrate the best part, to share what he/she is looking 
forward to the next day, and to rate his/her mood [24]. 
Wysa [17] is an emotionally intelligent mobile app chatbot de- 
signed to promote mental well-being through text-based conversa- 
tions. It uses self-help practices such as CBT, dialectical behavior 
therapy, motivational interviewing, positive behavior support, be- 
havioral reinforcement and guided microactions to build resilience 
skills among its users. 
Eren [38] is a conversational agent that uses storytelling as a 
means of motivating children age 9 to 11 years old to share emo- 
tional events they experienced. It utilizes the Emotion Coaching 
Model [15, 37] to help children name their emotions, identify events 
that trigger these emotions, and guide them through reflective disci- 
pline to devise the next course of action. As an affective companion, 
EREN prioritizes active listening over discplining to setup a comfort- 
able environment where children can freely share their emotional 
stories without fear of judgement or reprimand. 
Woebot [12] is a chatbot that employs CBT to engage people 
who are experiencing anxiety and depression in brief daily conver- 
sations. A session with Woebot commences with asking the user 
what he/she wants to do: gratitude journal, need help or check-in. 
The interaction flow is depicted in Figure 1. 
When the user chooses the gratitude journal, Woebot asks him/her 
to share his/her positive experiences within the last 24 hours. If 
the user needs help, Woebot prompts him/her to elaborate on the 
problem, then proceeds to give a lesson and/or a story that is most 
appropriate to the shared problem. If the user chooses to check-in, 
Woebot asks the user about his/her mood and what he/she is doing 
to address this. The chatbot’s response will be based on the user’s 
mood: a happy or neutral mood leads to the gratitude journal while 
a negative mood leads to giving help. Stories are delivered in the 
form of dialogues which narrate the experiences of the chatbot or 
other made-up characters. The chatbot may also play videos as a 
mechanism to help the user develop a positive mindset. 
Woebot supports a number of other therapeutic features, namely 
empathic responses, tailoring, goal setting, accountability, motiva- 
tion, engagement and reflection. Empathic responses is the capa- 
bility of Woebot to respond to its users emotionally depending on 
the user’s mood. For instance, when Woebot detects that the user 
is happy, it can respond by saying "Yay, always good to hear that!”. 
Woebot can also tailor its messages based on the user’s mood. It can 
help users set goals by asking them want they want to accomplish 
over a two-week period. Woebot also establishes a sense of account- 
ability with its users by setting regular schedules and following up 
on previous activities. To motivate users and to encourage positive 
thinking, the chatbot sends personal messages daily accompanied 
with emojis and animated gifs. Lastly, it provides a weekly chart of 
the user’s mood to encourage self-reflection. 

3 METHOD 
Recurring stress that is left uncontrolled can lead to mental health 
problems like anxiety and depression. Our study seeks to deter- 
mine the perception of Senior High School (SHS) students on the 
effectiveness of engaging in daily text-based conversations with a 
mental health chatbot to help alleviate the academic stress they ex- 
perience. Accessibility, ease of use and availability of related works 
are the major factors in the selection of the chatbot to be used. 
Woebot is designed to help people cope with feelings of depression 
and anxiety. It has been described as a friendly self-care expert 
and chatbot therapist that can be freely downloaded onto mobile 
devices. Here, we recount our process of recruiting participants 
and conducting the two-week experiments to collect stress level 
self-assessments and daily conversation logs. 
3.1 Participants 
After receiving informed consents from the parents of SHS students, 
emails were sent to invite these students to participate in our study. 
53 students responded to our invite. However, during the actual 
data collection, we have a 39% participant dropout rate. Figure 2 
highlights the number of retention and dropouts for each phase 
in our data collection. Among the 21 participants who withdrew 
from the study, 5 did not proceed with the psychological distress 
assessment (PDA); 7 did not proceed with the pre-test stress level 
assessment (SLA); 6 did not proceed with the daily conversation 
(DCA); and 3 did not complete the 2-week daily sessions with 
Woebot. Of the remaining 32 participants, only 25 completed the 
post-test stress level assessment and evaluation. 
Due to the large number of participants who withdrew from the 
study, the criteria for screening were not followed. Students who 
were willing to volunteer for the study were accepted as participants 
regardless of their psychological distress assessment scores. Table 
1 shows the demographics of the participants according to gender, 
age and strand. SHS strands are ABM (Accountancy, Business and 
Management), HUMSS (Humanities and Social Sciences) and STEM 




(Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). The average 
pre-test psychological distress assessment (PDA) and perceived 
stress level assessment (SLA) scores are also indicated. 
3.2 Procedure 
The actual data collection utilized a number of instruments that 
were administered through Google Forms: psychological distress 
assessment (PDA), pre-test and post-test stress level assessment 
(SLA), daily conversation assessment (DCA) and evaluation form. 
Psychological Distress Assessment (PDA). PDA is used to 
collect the basic information of the participants, namely name, gen- 
der, age, mobile device OS and SHS strand. Measurements of the 
levels of anxiety and depression were collected using the Hospital- 
ized Anxiety and Depression Scale [46]. This assessment consists 
of 14 questions that asked participants about how enjoyable they 
find their life to be and how often they experience feelings of anxi- 
ety. Results from this were intended to be used for screening the 
participants and removing those who were depressed. 
Pre-Assessment of Stress Level Assessment (Pre-SLA). This 
is a modified 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to measure the 
stress levels of the participants prior to using Woebot. PSS was 
developed by Cohen and his colleagues in 1983 [6] and is frequently 
used for the subjective measurement of one’s psychological state. 
The scale considers the self-reported measures of an individual on 
how unpredictable, uncontrollable, overloaded and hopeless his/her 
life has been in the past month, and how often he/she was able to 
cope with these situations. The questions were adjusted to pertain 
to two-weeks only, which is the duration of our experiment.

After the SLA, the participants were given a set of instructions 
describing (1) the procedure for downloading and installing Woebot 
in their mobile phones; (2) the features of Woebot, how to use 
these features, and how to contact the research proponents for 
questions and concerns; and (3) the process for capturing the daily 
conversation logs and sending these to the research proponents. 
Daily Conversation Assessment (DCA). During the two-week 
test proper, the participants were to continuously perform their 
daily check-ins with Woebot and were expected to submit the 
screenshots of their conversations through the DCA (Google Form). 
The DCA collects daily data regarding the experiences of the par- 
ticipants with Woebot, their moods before and after each session, 
their purpose for using Woebot and the length of the session. 
Post-Evaluation Stress Level Assessment (Post-SLA). This 
was administered at the end of the two-week period and is com- 
prised of three parts. The first part again measures the stress levels 
of the participants using the Modified 10-Item Perceived Stress 
Scale. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was then used to compare 
the stress levels before and after using Woebot. 
The second part of the post-SLA contains nine (9) questions to 
determine the satisfaction level of the participants in using Woebot 
and its various features. The third part is an evaluation of Woebot 
using three (3) criteria adapted from the study of Chan and Ong 
[5], namely performance, humanity and affect. Performance refers 
to the ability of the chatbot to formulate responses that are aligned 
with the user’s input. Humanity pertains to the user’s perception 
of the chatbot’s ability to behave like a human. Affect measures the 
ability of the chatbot to entertain and provide enjoyable activities 
for its users. 
4 RESULTS 
Here, we present our results and findings from the stress level 
assessments, daily conversation assessments and post-evaluation 
feedback from our participants. Analysis of the recorded conversa- 
tion logs are presented in the next section. 
4.1 Perceived Stress 
We used the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to measure the stress levels 
of the participants at the start and at the end of the two-week period, 
as shown in Table 2. The average stress level after using Woebot is 
19.48 compared to 23.72 prior to the start of the experiment, which 
equates to a 15.28% decrease in stress level. 
After analyzing the data using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, 
W+ was found to be 238.5 while W- was calculated as 61.5. At a 
significance level of 0.01, the critical value at a sample size of 24 
is 69, excluding participant 7 with a difference of 0. Since 61.5 <= 
69.0, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the stress levels of 
the participants lowered after using Woebot for two weeks. This is 
despite the increasing workload that students experience towards 
the end of the trimester. Results from the Wilcoxon Signed Rank 
Test support the 15.28% decrease in the stress levels of the students 
after using Woebot, accounting for 68% of the participants. 
28% of the participants experienced an increase in stress levels at 
the end of the experiment. These students reported that Woebot and 
its CBT did not address their stress. Only 1 participant experienced 
no change in his/her stress level.

4.2 User Satisfaction 
Using a 4-point Likert scale, the participants rated their satisfaction 
in using Woebot and their perception of its ability to help them 
deal with stress. The results are shown in Table 3. In terms of 
satisfaction, Woebot received an average rating of 2.96. 72% of the 
participants gave above average satisfaction rating because they 
found the interaction to be interesting and engaging. On the other 
hand, 64% of the participants perceived Woebot to be effective in 
helping them deal with stress, giving an average rating of 2.68. 
Participants who were not satisfied with Woebot’s support had 
encountered problems in communicating with the chatbot and in 
using its features. To further understand this, we asked the partici- 
pants to share their perception on why they find Woebot’s features 
to be (in)effective. 
Effective features. Table 4 shows the number of participants 
who found the features of Woebot to be effective. Participants

shared that they can relate to the relevant real-life scenarios pre- 
sented in the lessons which helped them deal with their problems: 
[Woebot] gives relatable lessons which help me reflect 
upon my situation. (P19) 
They were able to learn new things from the lessons which 
helped change their perspectives toward the problems they experi- 
ence. As P5 shared: 
It was nice to know how distortion in our thoughts can 
greatly affect how we perceive everything around us. 

I was also able to cope with stress and negativity be- 
cause Woebot was able to teach me how to point out 
distortions. 


It felt like someone was concerned about my mental 
health which was nice. 


It makes me realize what positive things that happened 
within the day and makes me realize what things I 
should be grateful for. 
Ineffective features. Table 5 shows the number of participants 
who found the features of Woebot to be ineffective. Some partici- 
pants thought that Woebot’s usage of CBT and lessons were a waste 
of time that disrupted their study time. They also found the lessons 
to be unhelpful and they cannot apply these in their lives. Consider 
the statement of P18 on Woebot’s lessons: 
I didn’t really find myself wanting to take/use these 
features. Lessons can be dragging and I didn’t use CBT 
therapy. 

It’s just my own preference, I just don’t generally think 
that breathing exercises help you feel better. 
They also do not understand the purpose of the gratitude journals. 
P13 admitted that it "didn’t change my mood at all or worsened it 
further", while P20 stated:

I don’t get the purpose. Moreover, explaining why things

I don’t know, just sometimes Woebot doesn’t understand 
the things I’m grateful for. 
A few regarded daily check-ins as an ineffective feature. One of 
the participants, P3, said that "it was a hassle for him to check-in 
every day". P8, on the other hand, stated that Woebot was ineffective 
at being human-like: 
Woebot did not seem natural at all to talk to as every- 
thing was obviously pre-programmed. 
4.3 Evaluation of Woebot 
Using a 4-point Likert scale, participants also gave their evaluation 
on Woebot’s performance, humanity and affect. The results are 
shown in Table 6. 
In terms of performance, Woebot’s ability to understand the par- 
ticipants’ inputs and to generate appropriate responses received an 
average rating of 2.97. The lowest rating of 1.8 came from partici- 
pants P8 and P20 who shared that Woebot failed to recognize their 
input. Participants expected the chatbot to generate coherent re- 
sponses that are aligned to their input so they can perceive Woebot 
as performing its task of helping alleviate their stress. Instead, they 
were perplexed with the kind of responses they received, such as: 
When i said "i don’t know" on my strengths and he said 
"that’s great". 
They also expected the chatbot to direct them to a relevant 
lesson, story or help guide based on the problem they shared. P7, 
however, found Woebot to be emphasizing on "textbook lessons" 
while P12 deemed the lessons "unnecessary and almost common 
sense". Furthermore, 
He could not relate to the things I tell him so he tells me 
things which is not even connected to the topic. 


Inability to respond properly to certain questions or 
concerns. (ie. "School Works..."). 
In terms of humanity, Woebot received an average rating of 2.92. 
Participants shared that the chatbot "helped me think rationally", 
"taught me how to meditate", and "helped me calm down". When 
asked if they can talk to Woebot the way they would talk to a 
friend, P5 shared that: 
To talk to someone 
To learn lessons 
To feel better 
To relieve stress 
To share problem 
Just to participate

He was able to give me insight on how my mind works 
which relieved me from the stress (Particularly that I 
have a growth mindset). 

Woebot felt like a real friend once like how a friend 
usually talks about nonsense to cheer you up when 
you’re down. 

Woebot gave me advices that my friends were not able 
to do so. 

I was able to gain new insights while using Woebot, 
some of these were very applicable in my struggles as a 
student right now. From time to time I would actively 
remember the topics I discussed with Woebot and it 
works quite well. 
This was echoed by P17: 
When I was academically and emotionally stressed, woe- 
bot gave tips to help me survive the week. 
Despite these praises for Woebot’s humanity aspect, its affective 
qualities received a lower average rating of 2.84. There are varying 
factors that (de-)motivated the participants to want to come back 
for another session as seen in Table 7. Out of the total 290 tallied 
responses from the Daily Conversation Assessment, the most fre- 
quent reason for using Woebot was for the sake of participating in 
the research (39.80%). The task of checking-in daily with Woebot 
for a period of two weeks has been described as a "hassle" that 
interfered with study time. 
Participants primarily use Woebot so that they can talk to some- 
one (20.64%) and to learn lessons (18.67%). As an alternative con- 
versational partner, Woebot received a mean score of 3.10: 
When you need someone to talk to, and you have no 
one to talk to. (P18) 

It gives examples that I can relate my problem which 
make me kinda feel light and happy. 


He’s very calming especially when I talk to him while 
cramming schoolwork.

What can I do for you friend? 
Need help 
Is this an emergency situation or are you looking for 
some help challenging your thoughts? 
thoughts 
Can I ask you to briefly describe what has you 
feeling this way? Write about it below 
I have difficulty learning some of the lessons in class 
and I’ve been beating myself up 
I see, you certainly seem to have a lot 
going on at the moment 
yeah 
is there more you’d like to share with me? write it here 
none so far just that one ... just wanted to share 
in a clinical setting, as journaling or writing about one’s thoughts 
and feelings as a CBT activity can relieve stress. 
However, the psychologist also noticed instances when Woebot 
appeared to have neglected the feelings of the participants, because 
the prompt “sounded like a routine question that was asked before 
getting into the lesson”. Woebot’s tone seemed impersonal and it 
exhibited an uncaring attitude when it administered a long person- 
ality quiz to P4 despite the participant’s expression of feeling tired 
and was getting ready for bed, as seen in Table 10. 
5.2 Ability to Change User’s Mood 
To change a negative mood to one that is positive, Woebot first 
helps the participant to develop emotional awareness by identifying 
the causes of negative emotions. Then it can ask the participant to 
rewrite negative statements to positive statements. An example of 
these two mechanisms are found in the log of P9 (Table 11). 
Despite these strategies, only 32.76% of the 290 recorded daily 
conversation logs expressed a positive mood change, as summarized 
in Table 12. On the other hand, only 3.10% of the logs indicated 
negative mood change. More than half of the conversations did 
not lead to any mood change which can be partly attributed to 
Woebot’s incorrect responses and inappropriate lessons.

Do you think sleep is a problem for you at the moment? 
I ask because I’ve got tools that could help, if you’d like? 
No thanks 
Okay, let’s do a story for now

I have a problem... I feel like we have disappointed 
our research adviser 
It sounds like you’re describing a very low mood, is that right? 
Yes 
Oh gosh, that must be really tough. Can I just check: is this 
something you would like my help with or did you just 
want to let me know? Both are OK 
Work on it... using thought challenger (tool) 
(started telling a story) When I met him though, he felt very 
sad and depressed, as well as anxious and hopeless 
Oh no ... what happened 
... and I asked him to remember one moment that he could 
remember feeling these emotions particularly strongly 
Why? 
Because it’s a lot easier and more effective to choose one 
moment to work with than a general feeling 
How so? 
But if we make it specific, then we can work on that 
I see 
Now try re-writing your thought "You did your best" 
so it’s more balanced 
You tried your best at the moment. You just didn’t know what 
was going to happen, extraneous variables happen. It’s okay 
You’ve worked through not only 1 but 3 thoughts and that is 
by no means an easy challenge! ... Well done, my friend

5 CONVERSATION LOG ANALYSIS 
Out of 290 submitted daily conversation logs, a random sample of 
ten (10) were selected, transcribed and forwarded to a psychologist 
for analysis. The intent is to determine, from this small sample, 
Woebot’s ability to motivate the participants to share their daily 
activities and causes of stress, and its ability to change the partici- 
pants’ mood through the integration of CBT techniques vis-a-vis 
their self-reported perception. 
5.1 Ability to Motivate Users 
The psychologist found that in 80% of the sample logs, the partici- 
pants shared portions of their daily experiences with Woebot. P2’s 
log showed that the participant was highly receptive to Woebot 
by willingly performing all of the three suggested activities (cogni- 
tive restructuring exercises). Furthermore, when given the choice, 
he/she even opted to “Talk more” rather than end the session. Ex- 
cerpts of the log is shown in Table 8, where P2’s responses showed 
that he/she is attentively engaged in Woebot’s storytelling. 
The log from P3, shown in Table 9, also showed that Woebot 
was able to encourage the participant to “just share”. This mirrors 
what a human counselor or therapist may recommend to a client

derstand the users’s input.

So tell me, what is one thing that went well in the 
last 24 hours 
we went trick or treating 
Awesome. How about one more positive thing, big or small? 
I can’t remember anymore 
Cool! One last one... what else has gone well for you 
recently? Maybe you ate some good food?! 
or got a nice firmware update. 
I said I can’t remember 
"If this happened in therapy, the therapist may lose 
the client’s trust and risk damaging their rapport or 
therapeutic alliance because it may come across as the 
therapist ignoring the client’s feelings. If the client feels 
unseen/unheard, s/he may not be as receptive to the 
skills/lessons available to them in therapy." 
Furthermore, Woebot’s inability to fully understand the context 
of the user’s input can also lead to missed opportunities in col- 
laboratively exploring the causes of a participant’s positive and 
negative moods. When the chatbot does not explore new conversa- 
tional bids introduced by the participants, these may be perceived 
as being dismissed as unimportant by the agent. This is evident in 
logs where Woebot administered a lesson on goals even though the 
participant said he/she was feeling depressed, making it seem as if 
the chatbot is ignoring the subject’s emotions. 
6.2 Procedural Challenges 
The methodology employed in collecting daily conversation logs 
and assessment is tedious for the participants. Even with constant 
daily reminders and prodding, not all of the participants managed 
to answer the Daily Conversation Assessment regularly. Without 
the assessment forms, we cannot provide a complete picture of 
the participants’ perception of their daily interaction with Woebot. 
This is compounded by the increasing academic workload as the 
experiments carried on for two weeks, which tested the persistence 
of the participants in sustaining the required daily check-ins.

In certain cases, Woebot’s inability to fully understand the con- 
text of the input lends itself to become repetitive. This can irritate 
the participants, as seen in the log in Table 13 wherein the use of 
the gratitude journal caused a negative mood change. Lessons on 
strengths and mindfulness, on the other hand, seemed to have been 
most effective in improving the participant’s mood, as exemplified 
in the logs in Tables 14 and 15, respectively. 
6 CHALLENGES 
A number of challenges affected the daily interaction between 
the participants and Woebot. We classified these into technical 
challenges and procedural challenges. 
6.1 Technical Challenges 
A major concern that was repeatedly raised by the participants 
and the psychologist is the misalignment of Woebot’s responses to 
the user input, which accounted for 50% of the analyzed logs. For 
instance, Woebot replied “Nice job!” to the input “Oh dear” during 
a session on gratitude journal when it should have prompted for 
another input. According to the psychologist: 




Positive Change 
Negative Change 
No Change

to find value in these lessons, they should be able to relate with 
the story characters and see the relevance of story events to their 
current situation and life experiences. 
Future design of Woebot and similar conversational agents can 
consider the use of reflective dialogue that is employed in the story 
reading companion of Chan and Ong [5] to generate questions that 
will direct the student on finding relevance of the story to his/her 
life. Questions that allow students to empathize with story charac- 
ters can also help them develop their own identity and perception 
and to make sense of their experiences [36]. 
Affective Companion. Affective companions combine HCI de- 
sign principles with theories in affective computing to develop 
chatbots that embody counselling skills for a wide range of mental 
health concerns [38]. People in distress are not only seeking advice 
from others but more importantly, they also need someone to listen 
to them as they share their thoughts and feelings. The gratitude 
journal of Woebot serves this purpose. 
Talking to someone that you trust is the most common form of 
support that can be offered to individuals experiencing distress. It 
can help lessen feelings of isolation and set forth a sentiment that 
someone cares. For students to see counselors as someone they 
can talk to, counselors practice active listening where they say very 
little but convey empathy in their responses [31]. Active listening 
encourages the student to talk more, which is both therapeutic 
and healing for them. For Woebot to employ active listening, it 
should talk very minimally but convey that it is listening through 
occasional positive acknowledgements such as "uhm" and "yes", 
paraphrase the student’s input, seek clarification and elaboration, 
and summarize key ideas and feelings [43]. 
8 CONCLUSION 
Workload and expectations to perform well in the school environ- 
ment are causing the rise of academic stress among students. When 
left unmanaged, it can lead to anxiety and depression. Comput- 
ing technologies have been considered as alternative platforms for 
the delivery of intervention programs to help students cope with 
academic stress. In this paper, we investigated the influence of en- 
gaging in conversations with a mental health chatbot – Woebot – 
to help alleviate the stress of senior high school students. 
During the two-week period of the experiments, we collected 
varying data including the psychological distress assessment, the 
pre- and post-stress level assessment, the daily conversation assess- 
ment and recorded logs, and the user’s evaluation and feedback on 
their experience with Woebot. Our findings showed mixed senti- 
ments regarding the perceived usefulness of Woebot’s CBT-based 
lessons, daily check-ins and gratitude journal. The interaction is 
influenced by the chatbot’s formulated responses when participants 
share their mood and life events. 
Further work will entail a deeper analysis on how the demo- 
graphics, i.e., gender, age and academic strand, contribute to the 
students’ acceptance of Woebot as a daily conversational partner to 
provide front-line support for their stress. Analysis of the remain- 
ing 280 logs will also be conducted to gain better insights within 
a single individual and across clusters of participants to draw the 
set of characteristics of people who may be open and receptive to 
mental health chatbots such as Woebot.

Furthermore, the lengthy instructions also caused confusion 
among the participants. This is particularly evident when accom- 
plishing the Stress Level Assessment forms that were embedded 
within the given instructions, and in capturing and submitting 
the conversation logs. Participants also encountered difficulties in 
using Longshot to capture their chat logs, which led to delay in up- 
loads and the submission of incomplete and unreadable screenshots 
which affected the log analysis. 
7 DISCUSSION 
Mental health chatbots should be designed to expand opportuni- 
ties in providing intervention and support to individuals who are 
experiencing stress. They should help students respond to daily 
pressures, overwhelming workload, and decreased attention and 
concentration in academic requirements. A number of interaction 
design implications can be gleaned from the students’ perception 
and feedback on Woebot’s effectiveness in alleviating their aca- 
demic stress. Here, we report design implications from our findings 
to inform future development of conversational agents in general 
and better chatbot for psychological help in particular. 
Story-based Conversation. Stories and storytelling have long 
been used from the time we were preschoolers as an approach to 
help us build awareness of our emotions [9]. Story-based conver- 
sation that encourages the sharing of one’s daily experiences can 
bring to surface the causes of positive or negative moods and stres- 
sors. Similar to Replika, Woebot asks questions to get students to 
open up with what they feel [28], and to ask them to share their 
day and rate their mood [24]. 
A crucial aspect to human-agent conversation is the chatbot’s 
performance in formulating responses that are aligned to the stu- 
dent’s input. While participants valued Woebot’s stories, an analysis 
of the chat logs showed that they faced challenges in cases when 
the chatbot generated inappropriate responses. Participants have 
reported that Woebot is capable of detecting their mood. How- 
ever, they also repeatedly expressed confusion and irritation in the 
chatbot’s out-of-context responses to the life events they shared. 
Communication breakdowns such as this can cause feelings of 
mistrust in the chatbot’s ability. Furthermore, misalignment in re- 
sponses can be perceived as ignoring one’s feelings, as seen in the 
example log in Table 13. 
Lessons, delivered as stories, allow Woebot to give advice to 
students to help them manage their stress, similar to how Wysa 
offers self-help practices based on CBT [17]. However, for students
