Manage Your Life Online: A Web-Based Randomized 
Controlled Trial Evaluating the Effectiveness of a 
Problem-Solving Intervention in a Student Sample 


Background: Evidence for the efﬁcacy of computer-based psychological interventions is 
growing. A number of such interventions have been found to be effective, especially for 
mild to moderate cases. They largely rely on psychoeducation and ‘homework tasks’, and 
are speciﬁc to certain diagnoses (e.g. depression). Aims: This paper presents the results of a 
web-based randomized controlled trial of Manage Your Life Online (MYLO), a program that 
uses artiﬁcial intelligence to engage the participant in a conversation across any problem topic. 
Method: Healthy volunteers (n = 213) completed a baseline questionnaire and were 
randomized to the MYLO program or to an active control condition where they used the 
program ELIZA, which emulates a Rogerian psychotherapist. Participants completed a single 
session before completing post-study and 2-week follow-up measures. Results: Analyses were 
per protocol with intent to follow-up. Both programs were associated with improvements 
in problem distress, anxiety and depression post-intervention, and again 2 weeks later, but 
MYLO was not found to be more effective than ELIZA. MYLO was rated as signiﬁcantly 
more helpful than ELIZA, but there was no main effect of intervention on problem resolution. 
Conclusions: Findings are consistent with those of a previous smaller, laboratory-based trial 
and provide support for the acceptability and effectiveness of MYLO delivered over the internet 
for a non-clinical sample. The lack of a no-treatment control condition means that the effect of 
spontaneous recovery cannot be ruled out. 


With the wide availability of computers and ready access to the internet, a number of 
psychological interventions have been developed into web-based instruments (Proudfoot 
et al., 2003; Shaw et al., 1999). There is now good evidence that computerized versions 
of interventions are effective, especially for mild to moderate cases (Andrews and Titov, 
2009; Proudfoot et al., 2004). One important limitation of computer-based tools is that they 
rely on clients accessing and using the web-based resources appropriately and without direct 
therapist supervision, making it important to develop software that is very accessible and 
straightforward to use for clients. Authors have therefore argued that it would be beneﬁcial to

develop computerized treatments aiming to be equally applicable across presenting problems 
(Mansell et al., 2009; McManus et al., 2010). 
There is a growing evidence base for computerized cognitive behaviour therapy (cCBT), with 
current research suggesting that interventions where there is therapist support are associated 
with larger effects than fully automated programs (Andersson et al., 2013; Hedman et al., 
2012; Johansson and Andersson, 2012; Palmqvist et al., 2007; Spek et al., 2007). Supported 
treatments have also been shown to have lower rates of attrition than unsupported ones. The 
amount of support can vary, with some programs requiring as little as one short email per week 
per client, while others delivered in ‘real-time’ require as much therapist time as face-to-face 
treatment (Kessler et al., 2009). Although the evidence for unsupported treatments is weaker, 
they have been found to be associated with medium effect sizes (Christensen et al., 2006). 
Open-access unsupported treatments have advantages in terms of cost and have the potential 
to ﬁll a large unmet need in current services (Christensen et al., 2006). 
This paper presents the results of a web-based trial of a problem-solving intervention that 
has been developed based on the principles of perceptual control theory (PCT) (Powers, 1973; 
Powers et al., 1960). PCT provides a unifying theory of everyday human functioning, including 
an integrative account of how psychological distress manifests and is maintained (Carey, 2006; 
Higginson et al., 2011; Mansell, 2005). According to PCT, all living things have a basic need 
for control, where the organism will act against any environmental disturbances in order to 
achieve and maintain control over its experience (Powers, 1973; Powers et al., 1960). From 
a PCT perspective, problems in functioning can be understood as problems in this process of 
control. 
Method of Levels therapy (MOL) (Carey, 2006) has been developed based on the principles 
of PCT. MOL is transdiagnostic and uses open questioning techniques to focus on the process 
of thinking as opposed to the content of what the client says. MOL also does not depend on 
the use of homework, written formulations or other tools. In a series of pragmatic trials, MOL 
has been evaluated in treating a range of difﬁculties in primary care (Carey et al., 2009; Carey 
and Mullan, 2007, 2008). In those studies, patients receiving MOL reported improvements 
in depression, anxiety and stress. MOL aims to maximize client control, whereby clients 
determine the frequency and duration of therapy sessions. The provision of web-based tools 
would provide increased control over access to treatment, and MOL provides a particularly 
useful approach on which to base a web-based intervention thanks to its use of open questioning 
and its focus on processes over content. 
A computerized version of MOL has been developed called Manage Your Life Online 
(MYLO), and a small, laboratory-based study has found it to be effective for helping healthy 
participants to address personal problems and reduce problem-related distress (Gaffney et al., 
2014). MYLO has been designed to simulate MOL questioning using an automated instant 
messenger interface. The next step in establishing the effectiveness of MYLO is to carry out 
a web-based randomized controlled trial where participants can access the programs via the 
web. The research in this paper therefore aimed to evaluate the usefulness of MYLO compared 
with an existing computer program (ELIZA; Weizenbaum, 1966) for helping healthy people 
resolve mildly stressful long-standing problems. This study sought to establish the feasibility 
of administering MYLO over the internet, as well as replicating the results of a previous 
laboratory-based trial (Gaffney et al., 2014) which found that both MYLO and ELIZA led to 
signiﬁcant decreases in psychological distress immediately after using the programs. We also 
aimed to replicate the earlier ﬁnding of a small effect (d = 0.31) in the difference between the 


MYLO and ELIZA groups in this larger, more diverse sample. Speciﬁcally, it was hypothesized 
that: 
(cid:2) 
MYLO and ELIZA would both be associated with signiﬁcant problem resolution and 
reductions in problem-related distress and psychopathology. 
MYLO would be rated as signiﬁcantly more helpful than ELIZA. 
MYLO would be associated with greater 
psychopathology than ELIZA.

The study sample consisted of students and staff recruited from the University of Manchester 
and the University of Liverpool, UK. The study was advertised via the universities’ research 
volunteering websites and with recruitment posters. Undergraduate Psychology students 
completed the study in exchange for course credits. Advertisements asked for volunteers 
currently experiencing a problem that was causing distress. Figure 1 presents progression 
through the study for all participants. 

Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale – Short form (DASS-21) (Lovibond and Lovibond, 
1995). This is a 21-item version of the DASS scale with three 7-item subscales measuring 
depression, anxiety and stress over the past 7 days. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale 
from 0 (‘Did not apply to me at all’) to 3 (‘Applied to me most of the time’). Normative 
studies have found high internal consistency for the scale, with Cronbach alpha values of 0.91 
(depression), 0.84 (anxiety) and 0.90 (stress) (Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995). In our current 
sample reliability based on the available data (n = 173) was 0.76 (depression), 0.78 (anxiety) 
and 0.78 (stress). 
Problem ratings. Participants were asked to provide their age and gender. They were also 
asked to brieﬂy describe the problem they would be focusing on when utilizing the program. 
They were then asked to rate their current distress about the problem (on an 11-point scale 
from 0, ‘Not distressing at all’ to 10, ‘Highly distressing’) and how easily they believed it 
would be resolved (on an 11-point scale from 0, ‘Cannot be resolved’ to 10, ‘Easily resolved’). 
These ratings were repeated at follow-up, but the ease of resolution item was re-worded at 
follow-up to how much the participant felt the problem had been resolved. At the post-session 
and 2-week follow-ups participants were also asked ‘How well do you feel the session with 
the computer went for you?’, again on an 11-point Likert scale (0, ‘Not helpful at all’; 10, 
‘Extremely helpful’). 


The study received ethical approval from the University of Manchester School Of Psychological 
Sciences Research Ethics Committee (reference number 11363). 



Participation in the study was through an online web link, which could be accessed through 
any computer with an internet connection. Participants were required to click a button to 
indicate they had read the online information sheet and consent form before proceeding to 
complete baseline measures. At the start, participants were also asked to provide a username 
and an email address so that they could be followed up at 2 weeks, although this was optional. 
At the end of this baseline assessment participants were asked to click a button which randomly 
generated a link to the MYLO program or an active control programme, ‘ELIZA’.

MYLO conversation reproduced from Gaffney et al. (2014), p. 10; ELIZA conversation is an example 
provided in Weizenbaum (1966). 
Participants were free to use their assigned program for as long as they wished, with a 
suggested minimum of 15 minutes. Each program included a link for participants to end their 
session. This took them to a post-session questionnaire and feedback form. Two weeks after 
completing the study, participants who provided email addresses were followed up via email 
and asked to follow a link to another follow-up questionnaire and feedback form. Cases were 
matched using the unique username participants had created at the start of the study. 


ELIZA (Weizenbaum, 1966). ELIZA is a text-based program designed to communicate in 
natural language. The program attempts to emulate a Rogerian psychotherapist (Rogers, 1957). 
ELIZA initiates a conversation by asking the user to tell her about their problem, and the user 


types messages in and submits using the ‘Enter’ key. The program then replies with questions 
that aim to get the participant to further discuss their problem. If the user thinks ELIZA has 
gone off topic, they are free to change topic. 
Manage Your Life Online (MYLO; Gaffney et al., 2014). MYLO is a problem-solving program 
that, like ELIZA, also aims to facilitate a participant focusing on a problem. However, in 
addition, it simulates the type of questioning that might be helpful for a person to be asked to 
prompt thinking about their problems differently and to begin to solve them. The program aims 
to help people identify the cause of their problems and will pose questions to encourage them 
to approach the problem in different ways, as an attempt to assist problem solving. It is based 
on the principles of PCT and aims to aid participants in solving their problems by targeting the 
same processes as MOL (Carey, 2006). MYLO is like most messenger-style applications. To 
begin, a person types in what is on their mind, and presses ‘OK’. MYLO then asks a question 
based on what has been typed. 

Based on Gaffney et al. (2014), where a Cohen’s d of 0.79 was found for the pre/post comparison 
of distress scores for those who used MYLO, power analysis revealed a minimum group size 
of 19 would be required for adequate power (0.8). However, comparison of improvements in 
distress between the MYLO and ELIZA groups in the same study revealed little difference 
between the groups (d = 0.31). Comparison of the two conditions would therefore require a 
minimum sample of 104. 
The current study employed a mixed 2×3 ANOVA, with group (MYLO or ELIZA) as 
a between-participants factor and time (pre, post, follow-up) as a within-participant variable. 
Problem-related distress was the primary outcome variable, with DASS-21, helpfulness ratings, 
and problem resolution as secondary outcome measures. In order to achieve minimum power 
we aimed to recruit 120 participants in total, with 60 in each group. 

Data were analysed using SPSS for Windows (version 20). The design of the study meant that 
participants who did not complete measures immediately after using the programs were not 
included in the analyses because it was impossible to know to which condition they had been 
randomized. It was therefore impossible to analyse data on an intention-to-treat basis. The main 
outcomes (problem distress and DASS scores) were analysed using per protocol analysis with 
the intention to follow-up, using the last observation carried forward as a conservative estimate 
of outcome when data were missing at follow-up. Only missing data at the 2-week follow-up 
were imputed. We provide means and number of participants without last observation carried 
forward for comparison. 
The primary outcome measure for the study was problem-related distress. DASS-21, 
problem resolution, and helpfulness were secondary outcome measures. Primary outcome 
analyses used general linear modelling repeated measures with group (MYLO, ELIZA) as 
a between-participants factor and time (baseline, post-intervention, 2-week follow-up) as a 
within-participants factor. Ratings of helpfulness and problem resolution were compared at 
post-intervention and 2-week follow-up again using ANOVA.

A total of 213 participants completed a baseline questionnaire, of which 171 completed the 
randomization process and took part in the intervention phase, providing immediate post-study 
data. Out of those who completed the study, 67 (32 MYLO and 35 ELIZA) provided data at 
all three time-points (baseline, post-intervention, and 2-week follow-up). Descriptive statistics 
for the sample with all three time-points are provided in Table 2. At baseline 188 provided 
information about their age. This ranged from 16 to 70 years, with a mean of 22.08 (SD 7.19). 
196 participants provided information on gender and of these, 160 (81.6%) were female. For 
those who provided data at all time points the average age was 21.28 (SD 6.13) and 56 (90.3%) 
were female. Participants in the MYLO condition spent an average of 13 minutes using the 
program, while those in the ELIZA group spent an average of 5 minutes. Overall approximately 
20% of sessions lasted longer than 15 minutes (40% MYLO; 7% ELIZA). 

Mixed ANOVA was used to compare participants’ ratings of helpfulness at post-intervention 
and 2-week follow-up. Mean ratings for both conditions at the two time-points are shown in 


















Fig. 2. We found a signiﬁcant main effect of group, indicating that at both time-points MYLO 
participants rated the program as more helpful than ELIZA participants (F (1,60) = 12.98, 
p = .001, η2 = .18). There was also a signiﬁcant main effect of time, with participants’ ratings 
in both groups increasing between post-intervention and follow-up (F (1,60) = 4.23, p < .05, 
η2 = .07). There was no interaction effect. 
Rating of problem resolution 
A 2×2 mixed methods analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted with the within- 
participants factor of time (post-intervention, follow-up) and the between-participants factor 
of group (MYLO, ELIZA) for participants’ ratings of problem resolution. The mean values for 
the two groups are presented in Fig. 3. There was a signiﬁcant main effect for time (F (1,60) 
= 48.78, p < .001, η2 = .45), indicating that participants experienced further resolution of 
their problem between using the program and completing the follow-up. The main effect of 
program was not signiﬁcant (F (1,60) = 2.49, n.s.), but there was a signiﬁcant interaction effect 
(F (1,60) = 5.74, p < .05, η2 = .09), which indicated that immediately after the intervention, 
participants using MYLO reported signiﬁcantly higher problem resolution (t (131.27) = 4.76, 
p < .001). Participants in the ELIZA group experienced further problem resolution between 
the study and follow-up than MYLO participants. 
At the start of the study participants were asked to rate how easy they expected their problem 
would be to resolve in order to compare the resolution ratings of those who expected the problem 
to be easy to resolve with those who expected it to be difﬁcult. Participants who rated the ease 
of resolution as 5 (the median for the sample) or below were rated as expecting it to be difﬁcult 
to resolve, with those scoring above 5 rated as expecting it to be easier to resolve. We did not 
ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference in ratings of resolution between these groups (t (170) = 1.09, n.s.) 
post-intervention.

The primary aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of MYLO against a control 
condition for helping online users to reduce their problem-related distress. Figure 4 illustrates 
the reductions in problem-related distress over time for the two conditions. We carried out a 
mixed methods 2×3 ANOVA comparing scores for users of the two programs at baseline, post- 
study follow-up and 2-week follow-up. As expected, participants in both groups experienced 
signiﬁcant improvement in distress over time (F (2,338) = 51.10, p < .001, η2 = .23). Contrasts 


revealed that improvement continued after using the program, with a signiﬁcant decrease in 
scores from baseline to post-intervention (F (1,169) = 36.71, p < .001, η2 = .18), and another 
signiﬁcant decrease from post-intervention to follow-up (F (1,169) = 21.93, p < .001, η2 = 
.16). These decreases were seen for participants in both groups (F (1,169) = .69, p = .41), and 
there was also no interaction effect of group and time (F (2,338) = 1.32, p = .27). 
Symptom measures 
We explored the effect of the two interventions on total scores on the DASS-21 scale. A 2×3 
mixed methods ANOVA was carried out. There was a signiﬁcant effect of time (F (2,314) 
= 49.39, p < .001, η2 = .24), representing an overall reduction in symptom scores over the 
three time-points. Contrasts indicated signiﬁcant reductions in scores from baseline to post- 
intervention (F (1,157) = 56.83, p < .001, η2 = .27) and from post-intervention to follow-up 
(F (1,157) = 9.87, p = .002, η2 = .06). The analysis did not ﬁnd a main effect of group 
(F (1,157) = .16, n.s.), or an interaction effect between time and group (F (2,314) = .39, 
n.s.), indicating that the two programs did not have differential effects on symptom scores over 
time.1 

The primary aim of the study presented in this paper was to investigate the efﬁcacy of MYLO 
as a readily available web-based resource, and comparing it with ELIZA, which provided an 
active control condition with a similar interface. Analyses did not ﬁnd MYLO to be more 
effective than ELIZA for bringing about reductions in psychological distress and symptoms 
of anxiety and depression, with modest but signiﬁcant reductions observed in both conditions, 
including further improvement at 2-week follow-up. We found that participants rated MYLO 
as more effective in resolving their problem immediately after using it. MYLO was also found 
to be rated as signiﬁcantly more helpful than ELIZA for resolving participants’ problems. Data 
on the amount of time participants spent using the programs also indicated that participants 
used MYLO for longer, which may indicate that this program was considered more acceptable. 
These ﬁndings are consistent with those from the pilot, laboratory-based trial of MYLO 
(Gaffney et al., 2014). While MYLO was not found to be more effective than ELIZA, these 
ﬁndings do provide support for the use of web-based interventions for helping individuals 
with mild to moderate distress. The results also revealed signiﬁcant differences in symptom 
reduction between those who met criteria for moderate symptom severity and those who did 
not, with those meeting criteria for moderate severity experiencing greater improvements at 
both immediate follow-up and 2 weeks later. Our results provide evidence that web-based 
interventions using a ‘chatbot’ interface can help with resolving problems and reducing 
associated distress, even for those experiencing higher levels of distress at baseline. However, 
based on these ﬁndings the possibility that effects were due to natural recovery rather than either 
1 A sub-analysis revealed that at baseline 35.5% of the sample met criteria for moderate depression, and 66.1% for 
moderate anxiety. Greater improvements were observed over time for those meeting criteria for moderate symptoms 
than for those who did not meet criteria at baseline (Fdepression (2,116) = 5.81, p < .01; Fanxiety (2,116) = 7.48, p = 
.001), but there was no interaction with program for either depression (F (2,116) = .41, n.s.) or anxiety (F (2,116) = 
1.15, n.s.), indicating that the programs were equally effective regardless of symptom severity. 


program cannot be ruled out. An important consideration for future research is therefore the 
inclusion of a no-treatment condition to compare the effects of MYLO with natural recovery. 
The limitations of the present study’s design limit what we can conclude from the results. 
Although the trial was randomized and included a control condition, the absence of a no- 
treatment group means we cannot be sure that changes in symptoms are due to the interventions 
or whether they simply reﬂect the symptoms improving over time (Posternak and Miller, 
2001). Regression to the mean could explain the differences in change scores between high 
and low distress participants at the 2-week follow-up. However, results did reveal immediate 
reductions in distress and symptom scores after using the programs for an average of only 
10 minutes, which are less likely to be due to regression to the mean. Despite its limitations 
the study demonstrates the feasibility of providing web-based interventions using this type of 
interface, and that such interventions can help to reduce distress in the short-term. Attrition 
at 2-week follow-up was quite high, and although the use of last observation carried forward 
provides a conservative estimate of missing observations (Engels and Diehr, 2003), the high 
attrition does limit the generalizability of the longitudinal effects found in this study. The 
design also meant that individuals who dropped out prior to accessing the programs could not be 
included in last observation carried forward analyses, as it was not known which condition they 
would have been randomized to. As a result, the data could not be analysed using intention to 
treat. 
Attrition is a problem with unsupported online interventions more generally. Drop-out in 
the current study was comparable to previous research using unguided web-based CBT, where 
attrition was over 70% (Christensen et al., 2006). It is also possible in the current study that 
the characteristics of the study sample contributed to attrition, as the problems being discussed 
were quite short-term and conversations generally lasted less than 20 minutes. It is also possible 
that participants dropped out because of problems with the programs themselves. Future studies 
will need to evaluate the user-friendliness of MYLO and of its interface to ensure participants 
are not lost to follow-up due to problems with the software. 
The primary outcome measure in this study was a non-validated scale ﬁrst used by Gaffney 
et al. (2014). The use of non-validated instruments presents some potential limitations in terms 
of the quality of measurement and also for comparison with literature (Clarke, 2007). There 
is also evidence that using unpublished scales can lead to positive ﬁndings that would not 
have been obtained using validated instruments (Marshall et al., 2000). Given the number 
of outcome measures a potential limitation of the current study is the lack of correction for 
multiple comparisons, with the potential for Type I error. 
Future studies will need to address the limitations of the current trial. The lack of differences 
between the two conditions will need to be addressed by including a no-treatment condition. 
Any future trials should also include validated measures for the primary outcomes. Recruiting 
participants already seeking help with problems, for example those seeking low-intensity 
treatment for anxiety and depression, may help with attrition and would potentially provide a 
clearer indication of MYLO’s usefulness. 
The use of an undergraduate student sample also raises limitations. The study advertisements 
asked for volunteers who were experiencing a current problem which was causing them some 
distress and which they felt unable to resolve. However, participants were not screened or 
assessed prior to taking part, raising the possibility that individuals participated who did not 
feel as distressed about their problem as others. Future studies should address this limitation 
by speciﬁcally recruiting individuals already seeking help with their problems.
