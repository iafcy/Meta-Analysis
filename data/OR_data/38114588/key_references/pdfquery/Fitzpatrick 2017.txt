Background: Web-based cognitive-behavioral therapeutic (CBT) apps have demonstrated efficacy but are characterized by 
poor adherence. Conversational agents may offer a convenient, engaging way of getting support at any time. 
Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated 
conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and 
depression. 
Methods: In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media 
site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a 
conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental 
Health ebook, “Depression in College Students,” as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed 
Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), 
and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). 
Results: Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and 
Caucasian (79%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) 
times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants 
provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on 
depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as 
measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, 
participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants’ comments 
suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional 
therapy. 





Up to 74% of mental health diagnoses have their first onset 
before the age of 24 [1]. Depression and anxiety symptoms are 
particularly common among college students, with more than 
half reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression in the 
previous year that were so severe they had difficulty functioning 
[2]. In addition, epidemiological data suggest that mental health 

XSL•FO 
RenderX

(page number not for citation purposes) 


problems are both increasing in prevalence and severity [3]. 
However, up to 75% of the college students that need them do 
not access clinical services [3]. While the reasons for this are 
varied, the ubiquity of free or inexpensive mental health services 
on campuses suggests that service availability and cost are not 
primary barriers to care [3]. Like non-college populations, 
stigma is considered the primary barrier to accessing 
psychological health services. 
Overcoming problems of stigma has been traditionally 
considered a major benefit of Internet-delivered and more 
recently mobile mental health interventions. In recent years, 
there has been an explosion of interest and development of such 
services to either supplement existing mental health treatments 
or expand limited access to quality mental health services [4]. 
This development is matched by great patient demand with 
about 70% showing interest in using mobile apps to self-monitor 
and self-manage their mental health [5]. Internet interventions 
for anxiety and depression have empirical support [6] with 
outcomes comparable to therapist-delivered cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) [7,8]. Yet, despite demonstrated efficacy, they 
are characterized by relatively poor adoption and adherence. 
One review found a median minimal completion rate of 56% 
[9]. A hypothesized reason for this lack of adherence is the loss 
of the human interactional quality that in-person CBT retains. 
For example, certain therapeutic process factors such as 
accountability may be more salient in traditional face-to-face 
treatments, compared to digital health interventions. 
With recent advancements in voice recognition, conversational 
interfaces (ie, those that use natural language as inputs and 
outputs) have begun to emerge. Conversational agents (such as 
Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa) may be a more natural medium 
through which individuals engage with technology. Humans 
respond and converse with nonhuman agents in ways that mirror 
emotional and social discourse dynamics when discussing 
behavioral health [10] and their capacity to act as first 
responders has already been evaluated [11]. Theoretically, 
conversational interfaces may be better positioned than visually 
oriented mobile apps to deliver structured, manualized therapies 
because in addition to delivering therapeutic content, they can 
mirror therapeutic process. Indeed, Bickmore et al demonstrated 
that a carefully designed health-related conversational agent 
could establish a therapeutic relationship with adults attempting 
to increase exercise [10]. The intervention was an embodied 
conversational agent, that is, it was designed with a graphical 
face to mirror human interactions that are typically face-to-face. 
However, most consumer-facing conversational agents are not 
embodied. The capacity of text-based agents to deliver CBT is 
a question worth exploring given the ability of widely 
disseminated evidence-based digital apps to reduce the burden 
of mental illnesses in the US college population, estimated to 
be approximately 20 million [12]. Unfortunately, the few mobile 
apps that have been evaluated formally have seen substantial 
challenges to sustainability since they tend to be built in 
academic research settings and rarely have the required 
infrastructure to support them. One systematic review of 5464 
abstracts identified just 5 apps that had supporting evidence 
from randomized controlled trials, though, as of January 2014, 
none of them were available commercially [13]. Thus, in the 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
interest of sustainability, this study tested the ability of a 
commercially developed text-based conversational agent to 
deliver CBT to college students. 
Given the variability in quality of available mental health apps, 
a conversational agent was created to integrate 15 out of the 16 
evidence-based recommendations for app development [4] as 
follows: built using a CBT framework; addressing both anxiety 
and low mood; designed for use by nonclinical populations; 
incorporating automated tailoring; reporting of thoughts, 
feelings, or behaviors; recommending activities; provision of 
mental health information; real-time engagement; activities 
explicitly 
to specific reported mood problems; 
encouraging non technology-based activities; gamification and 
intrinsic motivation to engage; reminders to engage; simple and 
intuitive interface and interactions; and including links to crisis 
support services. While these recommendations were created 
in the context of mobile phone apps, to our knowledge, their 
relevance in the context of a conversational interface has never 
been tested. 

Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of 
delivering CBT in a conversational interface via an automated 
bot in a way that facilitates engagement and reduction in 
symptoms. The current study compared outcomes from 2 weeks 
of a CBT-oriented conversational agent (Woebot), or an 
information control group (National Institute of Mental Health’s 
[NIMH] ebook) in a nonclinical college population. We 
hypothesized 
therapeutic 
process-oriented conversational agent would lead to greater 
improvement in symptoms relative to the information control 
group. We also hypothesized that receiving psychoeducational 
material in a conversational manner would be more acceptable 
to those who received it. 




Recruitment and Procedure 
Potential participants were recruited using a flyer posted on 
social media websites targeting a US university community for 
students who self-identified as experiencing symptoms of 
depression and anxiety. Inclusion criteria included age 18 and 
over (screened at the first level via checkbox confirmation) and 
able to read English (implied). To guard against compromise, 
for example from malicious bots, all potential participants were 
sent an email requesting that they respond denoting their 
confirmation. Confirmed participants were randomized via 
computer algorithm that automatically generated a number 
between 0 and 1. Participants with numbers 0.5 were allocated 
to receive a direct link to begin chatting with Woebot in an 
instant messenger app, and participants with numbers >0.5 were 
sent a link to NIMH’s ebook on depression among college 
students [14], after completion of online baseline questionnaires. 
Because the randomization allocation occurred algorithmically, 
allocation concealment was in place. However, the condition 
to which each participant was allocated was not masked for the 
service providers (Woebot Labs). After approximately 2 weeks 
(T2), participants were contacted again to complete a second 
set of questionnaires online. Participants were offered a prorated

(page number not for citation purposes) 


incentive of US $10 per completed assessment (US $20 for 
completion of both assessments). 
Since this trial involved a nonclinical population of college 
students, it was considered exempt from registration in a public 
trials registry. See Multimedia Appendix 1 for the study’s 
CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist [15]. 

Woebot 
Woebot is an automated conversational agent designed to deliver 
CBT in the format of brief, daily conversations and mood 
tracking. Woebot is used within an instant messenger app that 
is platform agnostic and can be used either on a desktop or 
mobile device. Each interaction begins with a general inquiry 
about context (eg, “What’s going on in your world right now?”), 
and mood (eg, “How are you feeling?”) with responses provided 
as word or emoji images to represent affect in that moment. 
After gathering mood data, participants are presented with core 
concepts related to CBT by link to short video, or by way of 
short “word games” designed to facilitate teaching participants 
about cognitive distortions. The first day included an 
“onboarding” process that introduced the bot, adding that while 
the bot may seem like a person, it is closer to a “choose your 
own adventure self-help book” and therefore not fully capable 
of understanding what the needs of the user may be. The bot 
also briefly explained CBT and notified the user that while a 
psychologist was “keeping an eye on things” (ie, monitoring), 
this was not happening in real time and thus the service should 
not be used as a replacement for therapy. In addition, 
participants were encouraged to call 911 for emergencies. 
The bot employed several computational methods depending 
on the specific section or feature. The overarching methodology 
was a decision tree with suggested responses that also accepted 
natural language inputs with discrete sections of natural 
language processing techniques embedded at specific points in 
the tree to determine routing to subsequent conversational nodes. 
For the duration of the study, the decision tree structure 
remained the same for each participant and parameters did not 
change depending on the participants’ inputs. Weekly graphs 
were processed using temporal pattern recognition to provide 
users with weekly mood description. 
The bot’s conversational style was modeled on human clinical 
decision making and the dynamics of social discourse. 
Psychoeducational content was adapted from self-help for CBT 
[16-18]. Aside from CBT content, the bot was created to include 
the following therapeutic process-oriented features: 
Empathic responses: The bot replied in an empathic way 
appropriate to the participants’ inputted mood. For example, in 
response to endorsed loneliness, it replied “I’m so sorry you’re 
feeling lonely. I guess we all feel a little lonely sometimes” or 
it showed excitement, “Yay, always good to hear that!” 
Tailoring: Specific content is sent to individuals depending on 
mood state. For example, a participant indicating that they feel 
anxious is offered in-vivo assistance with the anxious event. 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
Goal setting: The conversational agent asked participants if they 
had a personal goal that they hoped to achieve over the 2-week 
period. 
Accountability: To facilitate a sense of accountability, the bot 
set expectations of regular check-ins and followed up on earlier 
activities, for example, on the status of the stated goal. 
Motivation and engagement: To engage the individual in daily 
monitoring, the bot sent one personalized message every day 
or every other day to initiate a conversation (ie, prompting). In 
addition, “emojis” and animated gifs with messages that provide 
positive reinforcement were used to encourage effort and 
completion of tasks. 
Reflection: The bot also provided weekly charts depicting each 
participant’s mood over time. Each graph was sent with a brief 
description of the data to facilitate reflection, for example, 
“Overall, your mood has been fairly steady, though you tend to 
become tired after periods of anxiety. It looks like Tuesday was 
your best day.” 
Information Control Condition 
In the information control condition, participants were directed 
to the NIMH resources section and specifically, a free 
publication entitled “Depression in College Students” [14]. The 
ebook provides comprehensive evidence-based information on 
depression among college students including sections on signs 
and symptoms, different types of treatments, answers to 
frequently asked questions, and a list of resources including 
further reading, helpline numbers, and other resources. 

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [19] is a 9-item, 
self-report questionnaire that assesses the frequency and severity 
of depressive symptomatology within the previous 2 weeks. It 
is one of the most widely used, reliable, and validated measures 
of depressive symptoms. Each of the 9 items is based on the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th 
edition (DSM-IV) criteria for major depressive disorder and 
can be scored on a 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) scale. 
Scores ranging from 0-5 indicate no symptoms of depression, 
and scores of 5-9, 10-14, 15-20, and 20 representing mild, 
moderate, moderately 
severe depression, 
respectively. 

Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 
The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) [20] 
is a valid, brief self-report tool to assess the frequency and 
severity of anxious thoughts and behaviors over the past 2 
weeks. Based on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for GAD, the 
scores of all 7 items range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every 
day). Therefore, the total score ranges from 0-21. A score 10 
is indicative of moderate anxiety, with a score greater than 15 
indicating severe anxiety. 
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule 
The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) [21] is a 
20-item self-report measure of current positive and negative

(page number not for citation purposes) 


affect. Half the items represent positive affect (ie, interested, 
excited, determined), whereas half of the items are indicative 
of negative affect (ie, hostile, scared, ashamed). Items are scored 
on a 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely) scale, with 
higher scores representing higher affect. Positive and negative 
affect are summed independent of each other with possible 
scores from 10-50. 
Acceptability and Usability 
Mixed-format questions assessed feasibility and acceptability 
of both conditions. Participants from both groups were asked 
to rate on a 5-point Likert scale their level of overall satisfaction 
and satisfaction with content (0=hated it, 5=loved it, 3=neutral, 
2 and 4 unlabeled); the extent to which they felt the intervention 
facilitated emotional awareness (0=not at all, 5=a lot, 3=neutral, 
2 and 4 unlabeled); whether or not they learned anything (binary, 
yes/no response), and to what extent this learning was relevant 
to their everyday life (0=not at all, 5=a lot, 3=neutral, 2 and 4 
unlabeled). In addition, participants were asked what the best 
and worst thing about their experience was and to provide other 
comments. While we were mainly interested in qualitative 
responses pertaining to the Woebot condition, responses to the 
information control allowed for an informal assessment of 
engagement. Finally, for those in the Woebot condition, we 
recorded total number of interactions (ie, conversations) with 
the bot over the 2-week period. An interaction was deemed to 
have taken place if mood and context data were recorded. 
Session or conversation length varied from approximately 90 
seconds to 10 minutes, depending on psychoeducational content. 
Statistical Analysis 
Statistical power calculations using analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) revealed that a sample size of 70 would have 
sufficient (80%) power to detect a moderate-large effect size 
(Cohen d=0.4) for depression, reported by a meta-analysis of 
Internet-delivered treatments for adult depression and anxiety 
[8], with alpha at 5%. 
To determine whether any significant differences between 
groups existed at baseline, independent t tests were conducted 
on continuous baseline variables (eg, age, PHQ-9, GAD-7, and 
PANAS), and chi-square analyses were conducted on categorical 
or nominal variables (gender, race, ethnicity). Univariate effects 
of group membership on T2 outcomes were examined using 
between-subjects ANCOVA adjusting for baseline measures. 
Cohen d effect sizes were calculated to examine the magnitude 
of between-group differences. All subjects were included in 
intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Prior to conducting these 
analyses, the multiple imputation procedure in SPSS v. 23 was 
used to handle missing data assumed to be missing at random. 
As secondary subgroup analyses, we conducted completer 
analyses using 2x2 repeated measures analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) to explore main and interaction effects. 
Qualitative Analysis 
Participants’ responses to open-ended questions were analyzed 
for the Woebot group using only thematic analysis and were 
reported as frequencies. Data were analyzed thematically using 
an inductive (data-driven) approach guided by the procedure 

XSL•FO 
RenderX 
outlined by Braun and Clarke [22]. Data codes were generated 
systematically, then collated into “thematic maps” and applied 
to the entire dataset to generate frequencies. 
Ethics and Informed Consent 
The study was reviewed and approved by Stanford School of 
Medicine’s Institutional Review Board. Participants indicated 
their consent to the terms of the study via checkbox on an 
information sheet. As additional safety measures, participants 
in the Woebot group who denoted long-standing depression, 
suicidality, or self-harm were automatically provided with 
helpline numbers and a crisis text line number, and were 
encouraged to call 911 in emergencies. 
With the exception of data on usage, which were collected by 
the Life Ninja Project, all study data were collected by the 
academic institution. Because of deidentification of all data 
transmitted between the Life Ninja Project and Stanford, usage 
data were not linked to specific research participants and are 
reported as means only for the entire group of study participants. 

Figure 1 shows the participant flow throughout the study. A 
total of 204 registrations were received between January 31 and 
February 20, 2017, and all registrants were asked to confirm 
their interest by return email. A total of 115 responded to this 
email, though 45 of these were deemed bot-generated (eg, email 
addresses with unusual almost identical formats and identical 
responses) and were deemed ineligible. The resultant sample 
of N=70 were randomized via computer algorithm to receive 
either a direct link to begin chatting with Woebot (n=34) in an 
instant messenger app, or NIMH’s ebook on depression among 
college students [14] (n=36), after completion of online 
questionnaires at baseline. 
Attrition 
Of the randomized participants, 83% (58/70) went on to provide 
partial or complete data at T2 representing an overall attrition 
rate of 17%. Attrition was not equal between the arms and was 
greater among the information control group (31% vs 9%; 
χ2 
1=5.16; P=.023). However, independent t tests and chi-square 
analyses failed to detect evidence of significant differences at 
baseline between those who dropped out of the study versus 
those who did not on age (t68=1.18; P=.24); GAD-7 (t68=1.28; 
P=.89); PHQ-9 (t68=.63; P=.59); PANAS positive (t68=.79; 
P=.43) and negative (t68=.02; P=.98) affect scores; or on gender 
(χ2 


Participant Demographics 
Table 1 shows the demographic information and baseline scores 
on clinical variables for those with data from the entire sample 
(N=58). Participants were an average of 22.2 years old (SD 
2.33) and over two-thirds female. Participants were mostly 
non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), 79% Caucasian (46/58), with 7% 
(4/58) Asian, 9% (5/58) more than one race, 2% (2/58) African 
American, and 2% (2/58) Native American/Alaskan Native. 
In terms of baseline characteristics, nearly half (46%, 32/69) of 
the sample was in the moderately-severe or severe range of

Preliminary Efficacy 
Table 2 shows the results of the primary ITT analyses conducted 
on the entire sample. Univariate ANCOVA revealed a significant 
treatment effect on depression revealing that those in the Woebot 
group significantly reduced PHQ-9 score while those in the 
information control group did not (F1,48=6.03; P=.017) (see 
Figure 2). This represented a moderate between-groups effect 
size (d=0.44). This effect is robust after Bonferroni correction 
for multiple comparisons (P=.04). No other significant 
between-group differences were observed on anxiety or affect. 
Completer Analysis 
As a secondary analysis, to explore whether any main effects 
existed, 2x2 repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted on 
the primary outcome variables (with the exception of PHQ-9) 
among completers only. A significant main effect was observed 
on GAD-7 (F1,54=9.24; P=.004) suggesting that completers 
experienced a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety 
between baseline and T2, regardless of the group to which they 
were assigned with a within-subjects effect size of d=0.37. No 
main effects were observed for positive (F1,50=.001; P=.951; 
d=0.21) or negative affect (F1,50=.06; P=.80; d=0.003) as 
measured by the PANAS. 
To further elucidate the source and magnitude of change in 
depression, repeated measures dependent t tests were conducted 
and Cohen d effect sizes were calculated on individual items of 
the PHQ-9 among those in the Woebot condition. The analysis 
revealed that baseline-T2 changes were observed on the 
following items in order of decreasing magnitude: motoric 
symptoms (d=2.09), appetite (d=0.65), little interest or pleasure 
in things (d=0.44), feeling bad about self (d=0.40), and

concentration (d=0.39), and suicidal thoughts (d=0.30), feeling 
down (d=0.14), sleep (d=0.12), and energy (d=0.06). 
Use and Acceptability 
Participants in the Woebot condition checked in with the bot 
(defined as at least providing context and mood information) 
an average of 12.14 times (SD 2.23; median 12; range 8-18) 
over the 2-week period, with almost all check-ins occurring on 
unique days. Since we could not track website visits, page views, 
click-through rates, etc, of NIMH’s website that hosted the 
ebook, we have no means of confirming to what extent 
individuals in the information control group engaged with the 
material. However, a total of 13 (52%) provided detailed 
comments suggesting they had read the ebook at least once. 
While ratings indicated that both conditions were acceptable 
(above 3/5), participants in the Woebot condition reported 
significantly higher levels of satisfaction both overall (4.3 versus 
3.4; t48=3.99; P<.001) and with content (4.0 versus 3.4; t48=2.30; 
P=.02), and they reported a significantly greater amount of 
emotional awareness as a result of using the bot (3.3 versus 2.7; 
t47.06=2.38; P=.021) than the information control group. All 
(100%) of the participants in the Woebot group endorsed having 
learned something new versus three-quarters (77%) of the 
information control group, though numbers were too small in 
some cells to allow for a chi-square analysis. There was no 
difference between groups in how relevant participants viewed 
that learning to everyday life. 
Qualitative Results 
Figure 3 shows a thematic map of participants’ responses to the 
question “What was the best thing about your experience using 
Woebot?” Two major themes emerged in respect to this 
question: process and content. In the process theme, the 
subthemes that emerged were accountability from daily 
check-ins (noted by 9 participants); the empathy that the bot 
showed, or other factors relating to his “personality” (n=7); and 
the learning that the bot facilitated (n=12), which in turn was 
divided into further subthemes of emotional insight (n=5), 
general insight (n=5), and insights about cognitions (n=2). 
Figure 4 illustrates a thematic map of participants’ responses 
to the question: “What was the worst thing about your 
experience with Woebot?” Three themes emerged: process 
violations (n=15), technical problems (n=8), and problems with 
content (n=8). By far the most common subtheme to emerge 
among the process violations related to the limitations in natural 
conversation such as the bot not being able to understand some 
responses or getting confused when unexpected answers were 
provided by participants (n=10), and 2 individuals noted that 
the conversations could get repetitive. Technical problems were 
described by 8 individuals, with technical glitches in general 
(n=4) and looping conversational segments (n=4) emerging as 
subthemes. Problems with content were described by 8 
individuals, with most of these relating to emoticons and either 
interactions or content length.

A total of 11 “other comments” were received, which were all 
positive, either expressing gratitude for the experience: “I love 
Woebot so much. I hope we can be friends forever. I actually 
feel super good and happy when I see that it ‘remembered’ to 
check in with me!” Statements described how helpful it was: 
“I really was impressed and surprised at the difference the bot 
made in my everyday life in terms of noticing the types of 
thinking I was having and changing it”. Many spoke about 
Woebot in interpersonal terms, for example, “Woebot is a fun 
little dude and I hope he continues improving.” 

Principal Results 
To our knowledge this is the first randomized trial of a 
nonembodied text-based conversational agent designed for 
therapeutic use. The objective of the study was to explore 
whether a fully automated conversational agent based on CBT 
principals could deliver a therapeutic experience to college 
students over a 2-week period. We hypothesized that a 
conversational agent built to incorporate both evidence-based 
guidelines for the development of mental health apps as well 
as hypothesized therapeutic process variables would be highly 
engaging, more acceptable, and would lead to greater reductions 
in symptoms of anxiety and depression relative to an information 
control group. 
The study confirmed that after 2 weeks, those in the Woebot 
group experienced a significant reduction in depression, thus 
our hypothesis was partially supported. Woebot was associated 
with a high level of engagement with most individuals using 
the bot nearly every day and was generally viewed more 
favorably than the information-only comparison. 
Comparisons With Prior Work 
Using Woebot was associated with a significant reduction in 
depression as measured by the PHQ-9. The effect size for 
depression was moderate though smaller than the four published 
studies [23-26] that describe three other mobile app interventions 
targeting depression. For example, Burns et al [26] found a 
reduction in depression symptoms with a between-groups effect 
size of 1.9, and Watts et al also found significant reductions in 
PHQ-9 scores with an effect size of 1.56, both after an 8-week 
program. However, these interventions were much longer in 
duration than Woebot, which was just 2 weeks long. Indeed, 
our effect size for reduction in depression is in line with that 
observed in a randomized trial of DBT Coach [27], a mobile 
app for individuals with borderline personality disorder, who 
received a similar dose of 14 days.

The number of participants reporting that the bot felt empathic 
is noteworthy, and comments that referred to the bot as “he,” 
“a friend,” and a “fun little dude” suggest that the perceived 
source of empathy was Woebot rather than the bot’s developers. 
This is especially noteworthy since a purposefully robotic name 
“Woebot” was chosen to emphasize the nonhuman nature of 
the agent. This is in line with other work that suggests that 
therapeutic relationship can be established between humans and 
nonhuman agents in the context of health and mental health. 
For example, Bickmore et al [10] have demonstrated that 
individuals using a bot to encourage physical activity developed 
a measurable therapeutic bond with the conversational agent 
after 30 days. This embodied bot was built on substantial design 
work on establishing human-computer relationships [28]. In 
addition, a trial that compared therapeutic engagement with a 
nonhuman agent between individuals randomized to think that 
there was a human operating the agent or not demonstrated that 
individuals were more willing to disclose to an artificially 
intelligent “virtual therapist” than when they believed it was 
human-operated [29]. The results of this preliminary trial suggest 
that this should be explored explicitly in future studies, ideally 
employing a standardized measure of working alliance, such as 
the Working Alliance Inventory [30]. 
The frequency of process-related comments made by participants 
in response to questions about their experience with Woebot 
suggests that conversational agents can approximate some 
therapeutic process factors. In addition, just as these factors are 
thought to convey much of the variance in positive outcomes 
across therapeutic approaches, this study suggests that 
conversational agent process factors, such as the ability to 
convey empathy, may be capable of both amplifying and 
conversely, violating, a therapeutic process. This underscores 
the importance of including trained and seasoned clinicians in 
clinical app design processes. While this point has been 
suggested, for example in the recent guidelines for clinical app 
evaluation published by the American Psychiatric Association 
[31], and in the United Kingdom by the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence [32], this study goes some way 
towards illustrating the impact that therapeutic process variables 
may have on user experience in the context of mental health 
apps. 
Limitations 
There are several methodological weaknesses that limit the 
generalizability of the findings. As a feasibility study, we 

recruited a limited number of participants to receive a relatively 
short intervention, and no follow-up data were available to 
assess whether gains were sustained. The small number of 
participants meant that a formal mediator analysis was not 
possible, thus we cannot formally test a theorized relationship 
this context of 
between engagement and outcome 
conversational agents. The study should be replicated with more 
participants, a longer dose, and a follow-up period to investigate 
if findings persist. In addition, sufficient numbers to test for 
mediation effects would inform theory. Aside from indirectly 
inferring from comments, objective quantitative data on 
engagement were not available for the information-only control 
group, thus it was not possible to compare engagement between 
the two groups in a meaningful way. In addition, because data 
were deidentified, it was not possible to explore whether any 
dose-response effects existed. Nonetheless, the relatively strong 
comparison group can be viewed as a strength of the study. 
Indeed, the relative strength of the control group was illustrated 
by the fact that individuals providing data in that group saw a 
similar reduction in anxiety as those who received Woebot, 
which supports the literature that suggests minimal passive 
psychoeducation alone can reduce symptoms of psychological 
distress [33]. Nonetheless, the choice of control group was 
somewhat limiting for two main reasons. First, it may have 
contributed to the high attrition rate since an ebook is not 
designed for multiple or recurring sessions. It also did not 
introduce any CBT-specific material, thus it was not possible 
to evaluate whether the conversational delivery mediated 
symptom reduction, rather than the CBT content that the bot 
delivered. In order to answer this question adequately, future 
research should incorporate an interactive online CBT self-help 
intervention as a comparison condition. 
Finally, the study was conducted in a New York area university 
community population and since we did not formally assess 
digital divide factors such as socioeconomic status, findings 
may be limited in their generalizability. 
Conclusions 
While results should be viewed with some caution and the 
findings need to be replicated, this study nonetheless 
demonstrates that a text-based conversational agent designed 
to mirror therapeutic process has the potential to offer an 
alternative and engaging method of delivering CBT for some 
10 million college students in the United States who experience 
debilitating anxiety and depression. 
Conflicts of Interest 
The second author (AMD) is the founder of a commercial entity Woebot Labs Inc. (formerly, the Life Ninja Project) that created 
the intervention (Woebot) that is the subject of this trial and therefore has financial interest in that company. Woebot Labs Inc. 
covered the cost of participant incentives, though Standford made the payments.
