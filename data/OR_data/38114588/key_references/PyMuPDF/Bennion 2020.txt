Abstract
Background: 
The usability and effectiveness of conversational agents (chatbots) that deliver psychological therapies is
under-researched.
Objective: This study aimed to compare the system usability, acceptability, and effectiveness in older adults of 2 Web-based
conversational agents that differ in theoretical orientation and approach.
Methods: In a randomized study, 112 older adults were allocated to 1 of the following 2 fully automated interventions: Manage
Your Life Online (MYLO; ie, a chatbot that mimics a therapist using a method of levels approach) and ELIZA (a chatbot that
mimics a therapist using a humanistic counseling approach). The primary outcome was problem distress and resolution, with
secondary outcome measures of system usability and clinical outcome.
Results: MYLO participants spent significantly longer interacting with the conversational agent. Posthoc tests indicated that
MYLO participants had significantly lower problem distress at follow-up. There were no differences between MYLO and ELIZA
in terms of problem resolution. MYLO was rated as significantly more helpful and likely to be used again. System usability of
both the conversational agents was associated with helpfulness of the agents and the willingness of the participants to reuse.
Adherence was high. A total of 12% (7/59) of the MYLO group did not carry out their conversation with the chatbot.
Conclusions: Controlled studies of chatbots need to be conducted in clinical populations across different age groups. The
potential integration of chatbots into psychological care in routine services is discussed.

Introduction
Background
The developers of psychological interventions have harnessed
the internet as a delivery medium to enable increased access to
evidence-based psychological therapies [1,2]. Psychological
electronic therapies (e-therapies) have been defined and
categorized in multiple ways that refer to properties, such as
the type of technology being used or the level of therapeutic
guidance involved [3]. E-therapies are typically grounded in
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as the protocol-driven

format of CBT makes it a better fit for automation in comparison
with unstructured dynamic psychotherapies [4]. There is
growing evidence indicating that e-therapies are clinically
equivalent to traditional face-to-face therapies in reducing the
symptoms of both common mental health problems and somatic
disorders [5]. This evidence is based on the outcomes achieved
with working-age adults. Therefore, this leaves older adults at
risk of both digital and research exclusion. For example,
although older participants are rarely excluded from clinical
trials of e-therapies, they account for only 3% of participants
[6]. Feasibility and pilot study evidence indicate that older adults
are willing to use e-therapies [7] and do find the use of
e-therapies a satisfying experience [8-10]. When tested, the
evidence suggests that e-therapies can be clinically effective
for older adults with symptoms of depression and anxiety
[11-14].
An important consideration when designing e-therapies for older
adults is the user experience of the technology. User experience
research typically consists of assessments of the acceptability,
usability, and satisfaction of the technology being used. User
experience is defined as a “person’s perceptions and responses
resulting from the use and/or anticipated use of a product, system
or service” [15] and usability as “the extent to which a product
can be used by specified users to achieve specific goals with
effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context
of use” [15].
However, measuring the acceptability of e-therapies has
typically been limited to only asking older adults to rate the
acceptability of the technology before, during, and/or after using
a program. Researchers have also assessed the user experience
of e-therapies through measuring treatment satisfaction, but
they have often used unvalidated questionnaires, thus bringing
the results found into question [16].
Therefore, despite partially considering aspects of acceptability,
usability, and satisfaction, it is rare for e-therapy studies to use
the full array of international standards and associated validated
instruments of usability, but there are some examples of good
practice [17,18]. To maximize the reach and uptake of
e-therapies for the older adults, adaptation of the methods for
assessing user experience and system usability developed in
engineering and computer science appears fit-for-purpose [19].
This is particularly important given the evidence that the older
adults experience difficulty using e-therapies when instructions
overload working memory, making it harder to effectively
engage with the program [20]. Therefore, the older adults need
to continually relearn how to use an e-therapy program, and
on-going feelings of frustration would reduce the ratings of
acceptability of the technology and risk disengagement [20].
Thus far, attempts to fully automate psychological therapies
have been plagued with difficulties of low initial uptake and
subsequent low adherence [21,22]. One method that has shown
potential benefit for potentially increasing adherence to
e-therapies is the use of conversational agents that deliver the
content of e-therapies [23]. In this approach, software programs
interpret and reply to lines of everyday normal language, and a
therapeutic interaction is, therefore, created (ie, a conversation
takes place between the client and chatbot, mirroring the
conversation between the client and therapist). Therefore, the
process of engaging with e-therapy is more personalized,
dynamic, and bespoke, rather than simply following the
psychoeducational exercises and self-monitoring that comprise
most e-therapies.
In total, 2 conversational agents have subsequently been the
focus of most research attention: ELIZA and Manage Your Life
Online (MYLO), and these represent 2 differing theories and
associated approaches to the treatment of emotional distress.
The earliest attempt to develop a chatbot was by Joseph
Weizenbaum in 1966. His program (ELIZA) was designed to
mimic Rogerian counseling, a form of person-centered
psychotherapy based on humanistic principles [24]. ELIZA
applies simple natural language processing rules to the user’s
typed inputs to respond and generate text responses in the form
of subsequent questions and responses appropriately. Despite
its technical simplicity and the relative transparency of its
therapeutic model, ELIZA can generate convincing dialogues,
and there is anecdotal evidence of therapeutic effectiveness
[25]. Despite the initial interest, little progress has been made
to evolve and evaluate ELIZA into a fully automatic approach
for treating mental health problems [4]. Another chatbot called
MYLO has subsequently emerged. This is an attempt to
implement a fully automated technique for treating mental health
problems based on the principles of method of levels (MOL)
therapy [26]. MOL is a transdiagnostic form of psychological
therapy grounded in perceptual control theory [27]. MYLO uses
open questions to encourage users to reflect on their thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors, in a way that helps users to become
more psychologically flexible, and thus, more adept at reducing
distress [26]. MYLO simulates an MOL-style therapeutic
conversation through an automated messaging interface.
There have been 2 previous trials with student populations
comparing the outcomes achieved by MYLO and ELIZA from
short single-session conversations. In a pilot trial (N=48) in a
student population [28], MYLO was rated as more helpful and
led to greater problem resolution, but there were no differences
between the conversational agents with regard to any clinical
outcomes (ie, depression, anxiety, and stress). In another student
study (N=213), participants were randomized in a trial to either
MYLO or ELIZA before completing poststudy and 2-week
follow-up measures [29]. MYLO was again rated as significantly
more helpful than ELIZA, but there were again similarly no
differences between the conversational agents in terms of
problem resolution and clinical outcomes.
To summarize, despite developments in the reliability of system
usability testing in computer science and engineering, these
approaches have not been consistently adopted in the context
of the development and delivery of e-therapies. In addition,
where e-therapies have been developed as conversational agents,
any outcome evidence has also been unfortunately limited to
working-age adults’samples. Therefore, more research is needed
to investigate the clinical potential of conversational agents in
the older adults.
Objectives
This study sought to compare and contrast the system usability
of 2 chatbots (MYLO and ELIZA) in an older adult sample and

to evaluate outcomes using a randomized and controlled
outcome methodology. We hypothesized that MYLO would be
more acceptable, helpful, and usable than ELIZA, based on
previous research [28,29], but there would be no difference in
terms of clinical outcome. A secondary aim was to examine the
relationship between the system usability and acceptability of
the chatbots, particularly as Bird et al [29] specifically called
for greater knowledge concerning the usability of MYLO in
different groups.
Methods
Participants
Ethical approval was granted for the study (ref: 007599) by the
University of Sheffield’s Department of Psychology Ethics
Committee. A study sample was recruited from the University
of the Third Age (U3A), and participation was not monetarily
incentivized. The U3A is a movement that aims to educationally
stimulate members who have retired from work [30]. The study
was advertised over the Web via U3A websites and offline via
recruitment posters placed within U3A meeting places. Inclusion
criteria for the study were (1) being older than 50 years, (2)
being able to read and hear clearly (with glasses or hearing aids
if necessary), (3) having no medically or professionally
diagnosed current mental health disorder, and (4) currently
experiencing a problem causing emotional distress.
Measures
The time points at which self-assessed measures were
administered are summarized in a Standard Protocol Items:
Recommendations for Interventional Trials diagram (Multimedia
Appendix 1) and Table 1.
Participants provided a brief qualitative description of their
personal problems and stated how long those problems had
been occurring. Problem distress was measured on an 11-point
Likert scale (from 0—not distressing at all to 10—highly
distressing). Problem distress was measured at baseline,
postintervention, and 2-week follow-up. Problem solvability
was measured on an 11-point Likert scale (from 0—cannot be
resolved to 10—easily resolved) at baseline. To measure
problem resolution, participants rated on a Likert scale, at
postintervention and 2-week follow-up, to what degree the
problem had resolved (from 0—not resolved at all to
10—completely resolved).

Time
The time difference in minutes between the first and last
timestamp of conversation logs was used to measure the duration
of using the conversational agent.
Helpfulness
Participants rated how helpful the conversational agent was on
an 11-point Likert scale (from 0—not helpful at all to
10—extremely helpful) at postintervention and at 2-week
follow-up.
Use Again
Participants rated on an 11-point scale (from 0—most definitely
not to 10—most definitely yes) the degree to which they would
use the conversational agents again, but for a different problem,
at postintervention and at 2-week follow-up.
The System Usability Scale
The system usability scale (SUS) measures perceptions of
system technology and consists of a set of 10 statements scored
on a 5-point scale [31]. An example item is “I found the system
very cumbersome to use.” SUS has been found to have high
internal consistency in a number of large datasets [32,33], and
it compares favorably with other usability measures [32]. An
SUS score above 68 represents an above-average usability [34].
The SUS was only administered postintervention.
Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales 21
The depression, anxiety, and stress scales 21 (DASS-21) is a
21-item scale measuring depression, anxiety, and stress over
the previous week on a 4-point scale [35]. Scores can range
from 0 to 21 in each domain of the scale (depression, anxiety,
stress) and are calculated by summing the scores of the
representative 7 items. The DASS-21 has high internal
consistency (depression: 0.91, anxiety: 0.84, and stress:
0.90[35]). Participants completed the DASS-21 at baseline,
postintervention, and 2-week follow-up.

Procedure
To be involved, participants were required to either email or
phone the lead researcher (MB). The researcher inputted each
potential participant’s email address into a bespoke backend
study management system; the system would then send
participants emails containing a Web link to view the Web-based
information sheet and consent form. Upon consenting,
participants were sent a further email containing a set of
instructions about each stage of the study, along with a Web
link to allow them to begin interacting with the conversational
agent (ie, participants were free to withdraw at this or any
subsequent stage). Upon clicking the link, participants were
taken to a set of self-assessment baseline measures within a
Web-based questionnaire. After completion, the backend study
management system randomly allocated, with equal probability,
participants to either MYLO or ELIZA and generated the
accompanying usernames, passwords, and program Web links
to enable participants to access their allocated program.
The backend study management system would then email these
details to the participants along with Web links to a user-guide
video and usage tips Web page. The participants were given 24
hours in which they had to click the link in the email and log
in to converse with their allocated conversational agent.
Conversations were suggested to have a maximum duration of
20 min. After participants ended their conversation, the software
presented a set of postintervention self-assessment measures
within a Web-based questionnaire. Two weeks after completion,
the backend study management system sent participants an
email with a link to a Web-based questionnaire that contained
the self-assessment follow-up measures.
Electronic Therapy Conversational Agents
To ensure that both systems were judged on the conversation
they generated and not their respective user interfaces, the visual
layout and input method of ELIZA were altered to mirror that
of MYLO.
ELIZA
The implementation of ELIZA used in this study was based on
a version by cyberpsych [36], which is accessible through the
Web via a website hosted by the University of Sheffield.
Conversations with ELIZA mimicked Rogerian client-centered
counseling and aimed to facilitate problem solving by applying
the core conditions for change during Rogerian counseling [24]
(ie, congruence, empathy, and unconditional positive regard).
ELIZA opens the session with Hello, let’s talk and then adopts
a consistent nondirective approach. The participants progress
the conversation by typing their problems into a text input box
and pressing the return key. ELIZA then responds with a
question intended to maintain the conversation.
Manage Your Life Online
MYLO was accessed through the Web via a website hosted by
the University of Sheffield. MYLO is an automated
computer-based self-help program that mimics a therapeutic
conversation between a client and a therapist using MOL as the
change method. MYLO works by analyzing the participant’s
text input for key terms/themes and responds with questions
aimed at encouraging conﬂict awareness and facilitating higher
levels of awareness [28]. MYLO opens the session with Please,
tell me what’s on your mind. The participant progresses the
conversation by typing their problem into a text input box and
then clicking 1 of the response rating buttons. MYLO was
developed by Warren Mansell at the University of Manchester.
Statistical Analysis
The study uses sample size calculations from Bird et al’s study
[29], which was a continuation of the work carried out by
Gaffney et al [28]. A Cohen d of 0.79 was found for the baseline
and postintervention comparison of distress scores of those in
the MYLO group; a power analysis indicated that the minimum
group size required was 19 with adequate power (0.8). Bird et
al [29] found little differentiation in improvement in distress
between groups (d=0.31). On the basis of this, the 2 conditions
would, therefore, require a minimum sample size of 104. The
study aimed to achieve the minimal power requirement, and a
target to recruit 120 participants was set, which would result in
60 participants per group.
Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS for Microsoft Windows
(version 24). The primary measure for the study was
problem-related distress. DASS-21, problem resolution, time,
use again, helpfulness, and system usability were secondary
outcome measures.
The study used a mixed 2 × 3 analysis of variance (ANOVA),
with the group (ELIZA or MYLO) as a between-participant
factor and time (baseline, postintervention, and 2-week
follow-up) as a within-participant variable for the primary
outcome variable problem-related distress and secondary
outcome measure DASS-21. Posthoc 2-tailed t tests were run
to explore group differences using Bonferroni CI adjustment.
Secondary outcome measures problem resolution, helpfulness,
and use again were compared at postintervention and 2-week
follow-up using ANOVA. Secondary outcome measures time
and system usability were compared at postintervention using
independent t tests that applied Bonferroni CI adjustment. To
investigate the extent to which system usability was a predictor
of problem resolution, helpfulness, and use again, a series of
Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to assess the
relationships between postintervention system usability, problem
resolution, helpfulness, and use again. Simple linear regression
was then carried out to determine the effect of postintervention
system usability on postintervention helpfulness, use again, and
problem resolution scores.
Results
Sample Characteristics
Age of the participants ranged from 51 to 90 years, with a mean
of 69.21 (SD 6.76) years, and the study sample comprised 73.2%
(82/112) females and 26.8% (30/112) males. A participant flow
diagram is provided in Figure 1. In total, 112 participants
completed baseline measures, were randomized, and then used
the conversational agents, with 98 participants providing
postconversation outcomes. Of the 59 participants allocated to
MYLO, 52 completed the session with a dropout rate of 12%
(7/59). Of the 53 participants allocated to ELIZA, 50 completed
the session with a dropout rate 6% (3/53). Across both chatbots,

92.2% (94/102) participants completed the intervention. Of
those who completed the intervention, 94 (MYLO: n=47 and
ELIZA: n=47) provided outcomes across all 3 time points (ie,
baseline, postintervention, and 2-week follow-up). Those who
completed the intervention had an average age of 68.4 (SD 6.49)
years; 73% (69/94) of them were female and 27% (25/94) were
male.

Time Spent Using the Conversational Agents
The average amount of time spent engaged in conversation with
MYLO was mean 24.17 min (SD 16.46), and the time spent in
conversation engaged with ELIZA was mean 15.17 min (SD
8.77). On average, MYLO was used for 9 min longer than
ELIZA (t92=3.309; P<.001).
Problem Distress and Resolution
The problem-related distress and problem resolution scores for
MYLO and ELIZA are reported in Table 2. There was no
difference in reductions in problem-related distress over time
between the 2 conversational agents (F1,92=2.39; P=.13). There
was a significant main effect of time on distress regardless of
the conversational agent (F2,84=55.85; P<.001). Problem distress
significantly reduced between baseline and follow-up (P<.001),
but there was no significant postintervention to follow-up

reduction (P=.52). There was a significant interaction effect of
the type of conversational agent and time on problem distress
(F2,84=3.21; P=.04), although this was a weak effect
(eta-squared=0.03). This interaction was further investigated
using t tests. The analysis showed that there was a significant

Helpfulness, Use Again, and System Usability
There was a significant difference in helpfulness ratings over
time between MYLO and ELIZA (F1,92=8.801; P=.004). At
postintervention, MYLO (mean 2.94, SD 2.89) was rated as
significantly more helpful (t78.661=3.016; P=.003) than ELIZA
(mean 1.43, SD 1.86). There was a significant main effect of
time on system helpfulness ratings (F1,92=4.627; P=.03). In
terms of use again ratings, there was a significant difference
between the conversational agents (F1,92=8.772; P=.004), with
MYLO users postintervention more likely to use the
conversational agent again for a future problem (t92=2.882;
P=.005). There was no main effect of time regarding the use
again ratings (F1,92=.816; P=.37). There were no significant
differences in the postintervention system usability ratings
between MYLO and ELIZA (t92=1.710; P=.09). It is worth
noting that the system usability scores for both MYLO (mean
63.56, SD 17.90) and ELIZA (mean 56.97, SD 19.46) were
below the cut-off for an acceptable program (ie, <68).
Clinical Outcome
There was no statistically significant difference in DASS-21
scores over time between the conversational agents (F1,92=0.139;
P=.71). There was a significant main effect of time on total
DASS-21 scores (F1.830,168.368=33.538; P<.001). Total DASS-21
scores 
reduced 
significantly 
between

usability scores as the predictor variable.
This revealed a significant relationship between the MYLO
system usability score and helpfulness (P<.001). The slope
coefficient for system usability was 0.088, so the resolution
increased by 0.088 for each extra resolution point. The R2=0.299
indicated that 29.9% of the variation in helpfulness was
explained by the model containing only the system usability
score a significant relationship between the MYLO system
usability score and use again (P<.001). The slope coefficient
for system usability was 0.095, so the resolution increased by
0.095 for each extra resolution point. The R2=0.294 indicated
that 29.4% of the variation in use again was explained by the
model containing only the system usability score. There was
also a significant relationship between the MYLO usability
score and problem resolution (P=.003). The slope coefficient
for system usability was 0.095, so the resolution increased by
0.095 for each extra resolution point. The R2=0.176 indicated
that 17.6% of the variation in problem resolution was explained
by the model containing only the system usability score.

Tests of ELIZA using simple linear regression investigated the
relationship between system usability score, helpfulness, use
again, and problem resolution, with system usability scores as
the predictor variable. This revealed a significant relationship
between the ELIZA system usability score and helpfulness
(P=.02). The slope coefficient for system usability was 0.033,
so the resolution increased by 0.033 for each extra resolution
point. The R2=0.118 indicated that 11.8% of the variation in
helpfulness was explained by the model containing only the
system usability score. There was also a significant relationship
between the ELIZA system usability score and use again
(P=.01). The slope coefficient for system usability was 0.055,
so the resolution increased by 0.055 for each extra resolution
point. The R2=0.150 indicated that 15.0% of the variation in
use again was explained by the model containing only the
system usability score.
Finally, tests of MYLO and ELIZA results using simple linear
regression investigated the relationship between system usability
score, helpfulness, use again, and problem resolution, with
system usability scores as the predictor variable. This revealed
a significant relationship between system usability score and
helpfulness (P<.001). The slope coefficient for system usability
was 0.063, so the resolution increased by 0.063 for each extra
resolution point. The R2=0.224 indicated that 22.4% of the
variation in helpfulness was explained by the model containing
only the system usability score. A simple linear regression was
used again to investigate the relationship between system
usability score and use again, with system usability scores as
the predictor variable. This revealed a significant relationship
between system usability score and use again (P<.001). The
slope coefficient for system usability was 0.080, so the
resolution increased by 0.080 for each extra resolution point.
The R2=0.238 indicated that 23.8% of the variation in use again
was explained by the model containing only the system usability
score. There was also a significant relationship between usability
score and problem resolution (P=.01). The slope coefficient for
system usability was 0.038, so the resolution increased by 0.038
for each extra resolution point. The R2=0.072 indicated that
7.2% of the variation in problem resolution was explained by
the model containing only the system usability score.
Discussion
Principal Findings
The primary aim of this study was to compare the system
usability, helpfulness, and effectiveness of 2 conversational
agents (MYLO and ELIZA) with regard to problem solving
within a nonclinical older adult sample. This study was,
therefore, a replication and extension of previous studies [28,29],
but this is the first study to compare these 2 conversational
agents in an older adult sample. A secondary aim was to
examine the relationship between system usability and
acceptability of 2 differing chatbots. This is an important
research because the ever-increasing demand for rapid access
to psychological interventions in public services means that
alternative delivery methods need to be considered and tested.
Such methods can replace or supplement the traditional high
intensity-low throughput approach of traditional one-to-one and
face-to-face psychological therapy delivery. The conversational
agents were grounded in differing theories and approaches to
the resolution of psychological distress: MOL for MYLO [26]
and humanistic counseling for ELIZA [24]. However, the
conversational agents tended to enable problem resolution and
reductions in problem-related distress, with MYLO showing
significantly lower levels of problem-related distress at
follow-up. In terms of clinical outcomes, each chatbot enabled
immediate reductions in DASS-21, with reductions being
improved over the follow-up period.
Participants spent significantly more time using MYLO, but it
is worth noting that the time spent using the program was brief
in either arm (ie, an average of 20 min and this was a prompt
in the instructions for using the program). Average time spent
using MYLO and ELIZA is just 10-min in working-age
participants [29]. These results may indicate that adults aged
above 50 years are more willing to try and converse with a
program of this nature. The longer MYLO conversations may
be a consequence of the program’s more tailored and inquisitive
questioning algorithm. In contrast, ELIZA has benefited from
only limited improvements to its algorithm since its original
implementation in 1966. The helpfulness and use again ratings
of ELIZA and MYLO were significantly different, with MYLO
being experienced as differentially more helpful and also more
likely to be used again by participants. As MYLO was
significantly more helpful, this may further explain why
participants used MYLO for a significantly longer duration.
These results mirror the evidence found in community
working-age samples [28,29]. It may be the case that if time
was allowed to be at the participant’s discretion, then ELIZA
may have been rated just as helpful as MYLO.
The second aim of this study was to investigate if system
usability affected the acceptability of MYLO and ELIZA when
used by the older adults. Generally, correlations between MYLO
system usability and problem resolution, helpfulness, and
interest in reusing the system were higher than those for ELIZA.
These findings indicate that chatbot system usability has an
impact on how users perceive and rate their experience of using
a conversational agent. As Web-based delivery systems do not
have the benefit of a therapist to explain the rationale for certain
interventions, it is essential that system usability ratings are
systematically collected over the developmental iterations of
the systems. This is so that when a chatbot goes live, it is clear
and easy to use. If a system is confusing or frustrating to use,
then it is highly likely to be clinically ineffective; this arguably
mirrors the evidence base concerning the therapeutic alliance
in general psychotherapy [37].
The findings from this study appear consistent with accepted
models of system usability (eg, International Organization for
Standardization 2018 [38]). Although some previous studies
have also used the SUS as a measure of system usability in
e-therapies [39,40], it was a strength of this study to use this
validated measure and is the first usage with an older adult
population using a chatbot. It is worth noting that the theoretical
underpinning of the 2 conversational agents (MOL versus
humanistic counseling) may have influenced the perceptions of
helpfulness and, therefore, the willingness to reuse the system.

High rates of attrition are assumed to be a common problem
with unsupported Web-based interventions, but a meta-analysis
[41] has found that the percentage of completed sessions in
face-to-face CBT (83.9%) did not differ from the percentage of
completed sessions in internet-delivered CBT (80.8%). The
overall session completion found in this study was higher 92.2%
(94/102), but this was probably due to the intervention using a
single-session approach.
Limitations and Future Directions
The study is limited by the fact that it did not recruit enough
participants, and therefore, results should be considered with
due caution, due to being somewhat underpowered. It is possible
that the positive effects over time were due to either regression
to the mean or natural recovery processes, rather than the impact
of the chatbots. It is worth noting that, based on the power
calculation, sufficient power was achieved for baseline to
postintervention comparisons. Future studies comparing chatbots
in clinical samples would, therefore, benefit from randomly
allocating to a no treatment−passive control, to compare clinical
outcomes for conversational agents against any natural recovery
rate. Participants were recruited from an organization whereby
membership would imply that they were open-minded to new
experiences and willing to learn, and therefore, the results may
not generalize to other older adults in terms of willingness to
interact with a chatbot. It would also be useful to determine the
average chatbot session length, when the time of the session is
not recommended or limited or when there is a clinical problem
being discussed.
The prompt concerning conversations needing to last
approximately 20 min may have impeded deeper engagement,
thus preventing problem resolution. In terms of future research,
there are no published studies that investigate how the SUS
interacts with other dimensions of e-therapy, such as treatment
credibility, and further studies should examine this in more
depth. Future studies should also assess clinical populations
across the age ranges to evaluate if system usability and clinical
outcomes differ between diagnoses. If the primary outcome is
problem solving, then a conversational agent that follows the
principles and stages of problem solving also needs to be
developed and tested. The study would have benefited from a
longer follow-up period, and future studies should enable short-
and long-term follow-up. A possible innovation in future studies
would be to adopt a patient preference trial methodology,
whereby participants are offered the choice either MYLO or
ELIZA (ie, to suit their preference) and those participants that
are ambivalent about the choice of chatbot can be randomized.
Due to increasing referral pressure on mental health services,
the flexibility of service delivery systems is important in
reducing wait times for treatment, particularly in geographically
remote regions. Approximately 5% to 15% of the older people
also report chronic loneliness [42], and thus, chatbots appear
to offer some potential in terms of offering conversational
support to isolated older people. Talking with a conversational
agent may also be particularly useful for psychological disorders
involving high levels of shame and embarrassment. Indeed, the
real utility of chatbots may be in supplementing traditional
psychotherapies by reducing the number of sessions needed,
because the conversational agent can provide between-session
support and the therapist can focus on challenging change work
during face-to-face treatment sessions. Similar models of
augmenting face-to-face therapy with electronic alternatives
have been discussed by Broglia et al [43]. The manner in which
conversational agents could be usefully integrated into care
pathways of routine psychological services needs to be explored.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study sought to contribute to the evidence
base regarding the utility and effectiveness of chatbots for
psychological problems. This was achieved by comparing and
testing 2 equivalent systems in terms of their acceptability,
helpfulness, and effectiveness using a nonclinical older adult
sample. The results have proven to be both similar and different
from previous studies in working-age adults; MYLO is more
helpful, but neither conversational agent differentially enabled
problem resolution. Future controlled studies are clearly needed
to further evaluate the clinical and health economic utility of
conversational agents, but the context needs to be more clinical,
outcomes need to be evaluated over longer periods, and system
usability needs careful consideration.
