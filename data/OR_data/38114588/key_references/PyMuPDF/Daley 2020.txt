Background: Mental health difﬁculties are highly prevalent, yet access to support is
limited by barriers of stigma, cost, and availability. These issues are even more prevalent
in low- and middle-income countries, and digital technology is one potential way to
overcome these barriers. Digital mental health interventions are effective but often
struggle with low engagement rates, particularly in the absence of human support.
Chatbots could offer a scalable solution, simulating human support at a lower cost.
Objective: To complete a preliminary evaluation of engagement and effectiveness of
Vitalk, a mental health chatbot, at reducing anxiety, depression and stress.
Methods: Real world data was analyzed from 3,629 Vitalk users who had completed the
ﬁrst phase of a Vitalk program (“less anxiety,” “less stress” or “better mood”). Programs
were delivered through written conversation with a chatbot. Engagement was calculated
from the number of responses sent to the chatbot divided by days in the program.
Results: Users sent an average of 8.17 responses per day. For all three programs,
target outcome scores reduced between baseline and follow up with large effect sizes
for anxiety (Cohen’s d = −0.85), depression (Cohen’s d = −0.91) and stress (Cohen’s
d = −0.81). Increased engagement resulted in improved post-intervention values for
anxiety and depression.
Conclusion:
This study highlights a chatbot’s potential to reduce mental health
symptoms in the general population within Brazil. While ﬁndings show promise, further
research is required.

INTRODUCTION
Mental health disorders are highly prevalent, yet numbers accessing treatment are low (1, 2).
Reasons cited for this discrepancy include structural barriers such as a lack of availability, high cost
and attitudinal barriers such as perceived stigma (3, 4). Advances in digital technology along with
increases in internet access and smartphone ownership could oﬀer an opportunity to overcome
some of these barriers, bringing relative anonymity and scalability at a lower cost (5, 6).

Daley et al.
Chatbot Engagement and Effectiveness
There is growing empirical support for use of digital
technology in mental health, where web platforms or smartphone
applications are used to deliver evidence-based interventions.
These digital interventions are eﬀective, feasible and acceptable
to users (7–9), although are associated with low engagement
and poor adherence (10, 11). Adherence rates and outcomes
appear more favorable when active human support or guidance
is integrated into the digital tool (12, 13), but this limits
scalability. The development of conversational agents, or
chatbots could oﬀer an interesting solution (14, 15). Chatbots
take a conversational approach, simulating human interaction
through written text. This ability to mimic human support
could potentially improve engagement while enabling scalability
through automation. This could be particularly interesting in
low- and middle- income settings where there are large mental
health treatment gaps and scarce resources available (6).
Within mental health, chatbots have been used to deliver
psychoeducation, self care strategies and skills training and show
high satisfaction rates (14, 15). The use of chatbots appears
feasible and acceptable to users (15, 16), but there is less certainty
on eﬀectiveness. The knowledge base is however growing rapidly,
with recent studies ﬁnding that engaging with a conversational
agent over relatively short periods can reduce perceived stress
(11) and improve symptoms of depression (5) and anxiety (5,
17). These studies are all RCTs or pilot RCT’s and challenges
surrounding user engagement means that real world uptake may
diﬀer (10). Additionally, the studies were all completed in high
income countries, with small sample sizes (n < 75) and recruited
from student populations.
To our knowledge there have been no studies to evaluate the
use of mental health chatbots within Latin America. This study
seeks to explore if a mental health chatbot has the potential to be
eﬀective within Brazil.
AIM
To evaluate real world engagement and eﬀectiveness of Vitalk,
a newly developed mental health chatbot. The hypothesis is that
use of the chatbot will lead to a reduction in symptoms of stress,
anxiety and depression over a 1 month period.
METHODS
Participants
Vitalk was installed voluntarily by members of the general
population who had found it on the hosting platform, through
marketing campaigns, word of mouth, or a personal search.
Vitalk sought to oﬀer conversations about mental health and self
help strategies to improve well-being. Users had installed Vitalk
between June and November 2019 and completed 1 month of a
Vitalk program (N = 3,629). All users were Portuguese speakers
located in Brazil and over 18 years of age, with internet access.
Description of Chatbot
Vitalk is an automated chatbot delivering mental health content
in an innovative conversational format. It is a free-to-use service,
hosted within an instant messenger platform, accessible from
any internet-enabled device. The chatbot is built on ruby and
JavaScript and was created by the IT, product development and
UX team at TNH Health.
The overall aim of Vitalk is to improve well-being by reducing
stress, anxiety and depression using a preventative approach to
mental health. It consists of three core programs, addressing
themes of anxiety, low mood, and stress. Programs are 90 days
in duration, divided into three 30-day phases. During each phase,
the user is engaged in four to ﬁve conversations per week,
each lasting ∼5 min. Outcome measurement and feedback on
scores is built into the program, with users completing symptom
questionnaires at baseline and the end of each phase.
The conversations are based on insights and strategies
taken from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Positive
Psychology (18, 19), which include (but are not limited to)
psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation,
gratitude, and practical exercises such as breathing, relaxation
and meditation. The goal of the conversations is to help the
user reﬂect on experiences and learn techniques which can help
them manage stress, mood and anxiety. A mood tracking tool
helps to aid reﬂection, “emojis” and GIFs to mimic a natural
human interaction and gamiﬁcation to increase engagement. The
chatbot avatar is named Viki and was developed through focus
groups and piloting with users. The conversations used by Viki
are written by a team of Clinical Psychologists and healthcare
professionals and shaped by a user experience (UX) team who
work on the style and design of the chatbot. This involves
adapting including the words language used to make the language
more accessible to the user.
The chatbot initiates conversations, and the user can reply by
picking a predeﬁned answer option (Figure 1). The predeﬁned
options customize the conversation to suit user needs and
preferences. In some cases, the user can also enter free
text, for example between conversations or if they want to
interrupt the ﬂow. Natural language understanding (NLU)
triggers conversational modules based on keywords identiﬁed
from the text entered by the user, which then loops back to the
pre-programmed conversations. As an example of free text, if
the user types “good morning” the greetings module is triggered
and the chatbot will respond to the greeting, ask how the user
is feeling and oﬀer a suitable activity. In a situation where the
user types words directly or indirectly linked to suicidality such
as “life isn’t worth living,” the risk module is triggered and the
chatbot delivers crisis information. This is continuously reﬁned
and adapted to ensure the language and emotional expression
matches that of the user.
Vitalk does not aim to replace a healthcare professional or
to oﬀer treatment. Users are made aware of this in the terms
and conditions they consent to, and they are advised to seek
additional support if they show a high risk of depression or
anxiety during the assessment. Where the system identiﬁes a
risk issue, the user is sent details of support services, including
the national suicide line, and where appropriate, a follow
up conversation with a healthcare professional from Vitalk
is initiated.

MEASURES
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)
The GAD-7 is a 7-item self-report scale used to assess anxiety
symptoms over the past 2 weeks (e.g., how often have you been
bothered by feeling afraid something awful might happen). Scores
range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) with a total of 21.
The total scores are divided into four categories: none (0–4), mild
(5–9), moderate (10–14) and severe (15+) symptoms (20, 21).
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)
The PHQ-9 is a 9 item self-report scale that evaluates symptoms
of depression over the past 2 weeks (e.g., how often have
you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless).
Item response options use a Likert scale ranging from 0
(not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Total scores are divided
into ﬁve categories: none (0–4), mild (5–9), moderate (10–
14), moderately severe (15–19) and severe (20+) symptoms
(22, 23).
Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale
(DASS-21) - Stress Subscale
The DASS-21 is a 21 item self-report questionnaire consisting
of three scales to measure depression, anxiety, and stress. Only
the stress subscale was used, this consists of seven items, and
the user is asked how much each statement applies to them in
the past week (e.g., I found it diﬃcult to relax). Scores range
from 0 (did not apply) to 3 (applied very much or most of the
time). Total scores are doubled and divided into ﬁve categories:
normal (0–14), mild (15–18), moderate (19–25), severe (26–33)
and extremely severe (34+) levels of stress (24, 25).
All scales have been translated into Brazilian Portuguese and
are validated for use within this population.
PROCEDURES
After installing Vitalk, users complete a sign-up process that
includes consenting to their anonymized data being used for
research purposes. The user is then engaged in a conversation
with the chatbot, who welcomes them to Vitalk and together
they complete the baseline outcome measures. User responses
are recorded and scored by the chatbot, and the user receives
customized feedback based on their scores. The user then chooses
which of the three programs to complete, or they can ask the
chatbot to recommend one based on their scores.
After a program has been selected, the core content is
scheduled for delivery to the user over the course of 30 days.
When new content is delivered, the user is alerted to a new
message, and they choose whether to engage in the conversation.
The responses of the user shape the conversation. Original
content is delivered on the next scheduled day, regardless of
previous engagement. The user can discontinue the program or
close their account at any time.
At the end of phase one (day 30), the outcome measure
corresponding to the active program is repeated (GAD-7 for the
anxiety program, PHQ-9 for low mood, DASS-21 for stress). At
this point, the user can continue with the program they are in or
swap to another program if their goal has shifted. A full check-
up consisting of all three measures is repeated at the end of the
program (day 90).
For this study, we explored results from the ﬁrst phase of each
program to ascertain early engagement and explore initial eﬀects.
Data Collection and Privacy
The
study
involved
real-world
data
obtained
from
an
anonymous, non-clinical population. The users agreed to
the terms of service and privacy policy when they signed up,
which includes giving consent for their anonymized data to
be used for research purposes. Access to the chatbot requires a
login and is password protected, and data gathered by Vitalk is
stored on a secure server. Data were extracted from the server,
anonymized and provided to the authors for data analysis.
Demographic data was collected by the hosting platform who
provided this to TNH Health in an aggregated format.

Chatbot Engagement and Effectiveness
Statistical Analysis
Three sets of univariate analyses were conducted with data
collected from the GAD-7, PHQ-9 and DASS-21 stress scales.
Engagement with Vitalk was quantiﬁed as a rate measure by
dividing the number of messages sent by the number of days
in the program. Descriptive statistics were used to describe
centrality and distribution of pre-post scale values, severity of
symptoms and engagement. To describe the magnitude of change
across the intervention, average based change was quantiﬁed
with Cohen’s d and standard reference values (0.2: “small,” 0.5:
“medium,” and ≥0.8: “large” used to qualitatively describe the
eﬀect) (26).
d = (Mpost −Mpre)/ Sdiﬀ
Where M is the mean and Sdiﬀis the standard deviation of the
change in scale values across the intervention. For the PHQ-
9 and GAD-7 scales, reliable change and clinical caseness was
assessed. For each scale, the Reliable Change Index was calculated
by multiplying the standard error of the diﬀerence by 1.96 (27).
SEdiﬀ= Spre
√
2
√
1 −r
Spre is the standard deviation of pre-intervention values and
r is the reliability obtained in validation studies of each scale
(28). To be considered reliable, change in scale values across
the intervention had to exceed 5.9 for the PHQ-9 and 3.7 for
the GAD-7.
Clinical caseness was examined by calculating the number of
people who were above the clinical cut oﬀat baseline and moved
below this cut oﬀat follow-up. The number of these people that
experienced a reliable change was also quantiﬁed. A cut-oﬀscore
of ≥10 was used for the PHQ-9, and ≥8 for the GAD-7.
Modeling of post scale values were completed with pre scale
values and engagement included as predictor variables. Because
the scales used can exhibit ﬂoor and ceiling eﬀects with many
observations at the upper value, tobit regression models were
used to deal with the truncated nature of the data and limit biased
estimates that can be obtained with Ordinary Least Squares
Regression (29). All statistical analyses were conducted in R
version 3.5.3 (30).
RESULTS
In total, 3,629 users were included in this study. They were
located across Brazil; the majority were female (76%) and aged
18–24 years (52%) (536/1,648, 32.5%).
Symptom Change
Less Anxiety Program
In total, 1,648 (45.4%) users completed the ﬁrst phase of the
anxiety program.
The average anxiety score (GAD-7) reduced from moderate
anxiety (Table 1) (mean 12.2, SD = 4.7) to mild anxiety (mean
8.1, SD = 4.7). This reduction was −4.1 ± 4.8 [t(1,647) = −34.3,
p < 0.001) with Cohen’s d = −0.85 indicating a large eﬀect.
The percentage of reliable improvement and reliable decline was

655 (49.0%) users who were above the clinical cut-oﬀat baseline
moved to below clinical cut-oﬀat follow up [GAD-7 ≥8), 557
(41.6%) of whom also showed reliable improvement].
Better Mood Program
In total 1,243 users (34.3%) completed the ﬁrst phase of the
depression program.
The average depression score (PHQ-9) reduced from a
moderately severe level (mean 15.9, SD = 6.5) to a moderate
level (mean 10.4, SD = 6.5) (Table 2). This reduction was −5.5
± 6.0 [t(1,242) = −31.9, p < 0.001) with Cohen’s d = −0.91
indicating a large eﬀect. The percentage of reliable improvement
and reliable decline was equal to 45.1 and 2.3%, respectively. In
terms of clinical caseness 449 (46.3%) of users who were above
the clinical cut-oﬀat baseline moved to below clinical cut-oﬀat
follow up (PHQ-9 total score ≥10), of whom 370 (38.1%) also
showed reliable improvement.
Less Stress Program
In total, 738 users (20.34%) completed the ﬁrst phase of the
stress program.
Within this period, the average stress score (DASS-21 stress
scale) was reduced from severe levels (mean 25.8, SD 9.1) to
mild levels (mean 17.5, SD = 9.3) (Table 3). This reduction was
−8.3 ± 10.3 [t(737) = −21.9, p < 0.001] with Cohen’s d = −0.81
indicating a large eﬀect. The percentage of reliable improvement
and reliable decline was equal to 60.3 and 9.2%, respectively.

program) within the ﬁrst phase of the program was 8.17 (SD,
3.67), with a range of between 0.29 and 40.25 responses.
Tobit regression models were used to assess the eﬀects of
engagement on intervention eﬀectiveness after controlling for
pre-intervention values (Table 4). Increased engagement resulted
in improved post-intervention values for anxiety and depression
(p < 0.01) but not stress (p = 0.716). No interaction eﬀect was
identiﬁed between engagement and pre-intervention values for
any of the outcomes measured (p ≥0.08).
DISCUSSION
Initial results indicate that the use of a mental health chatbot
within this population can engage users and signiﬁcantly reduce
symptoms of anxiety, depression and levels of stress. Higher
engagement with the chatbot, as measured by the number of
responses sent by the user was also found to predict lower anxiety
and depressive symptoms at follow up. To our knowledge this is
the ﬁrst study to examine the use of a mental health chatbot in
Latin America, and results appear promising.
The majority of the sample were adult females under 24 years
of age (52% 18–24 years, 76% female). This diﬀered somewhat
to the typical demographic proﬁle of the host platform (29% 25–
34 years, 54% female) (31) but it is not clear if this reﬂects the
chatbot appealing more to this demographic, diﬀering mental
health prevalence rates (32), levels of help seeking behavior (33)
or marketing bias.
Baseline levels of anxiety and depression were signiﬁcantly
higher than would be expected in the general population in Brazil
based on previous research using the same measures (34, 35).
This was not unexpected given users had actively sought out
a mental health tool but does indicate that Vitalk is able to
successfully reach its target audience and could be a useful way to
engage individuals experiencing elevated stress and mental health
symptoms. This ﬁnding ﬁts with the idea that people recruited
through methods that imply more active treatment-seeking such
as a Google or Facebook search, present with high levels of
anxiety and depression than through more passive methods (36).
Interestingly, those recruited by online advertisements have been
found to have similar levels of depression and anxiety as those
recruited from clinical settings, suggesting the chatbot could be
a helpful way to widen access and identify those most at risk,
facilitating access to appropriate professional support (36).
Reliable improvements were found in all three programs with
symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress reducing between
baseline and follow up with large eﬀect sizes. These ﬁndings are in
line with other chatbot studies (5, 17, 37) but with a much larger
sample size and suggests applicability within Brazil. Interestingly,
large numbers of users showed clinically signiﬁcant, reliable
change, moving from a clinical to non-clinical range for anxiety
and depression as measured by the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Whilst
this requires follow-up and further investigation, these initial
results are extremely promising. It is unclear why there is such a
magnitude of change, but one hypothesis is that participants had
independently sought out a mental health tool and so were likely
to have high motivation and a readiness to change.
LIMITATIONS
This study presents preliminary data obtained over a brief
engagement period without a control group. While an early
response is found to be a strong predictor of the treatment
outcome (38), there is a need to complete a more rigorous
study with a control group and longer follow up before drawing
any ﬁrm conclusions. It is hoped that the evidence presented
in this paper will direct further clinical research and help
in the planning of new technological interventions within
this population.
Within this study, we had limited information on the users
of Vitalk due to the method of data collection within the host
platform. The lack of individual-level demographics limited the
analysis. In future work it would be important to obtain more
detailed information and a deeper understanding of users, for
example, individual-level demographics and data on education
levels and socio-economic status which may impact outcomes.
It would also be interesting to explore if the users have had
any psychological intervention in the past and if they are
doing so currently. This would oﬀer insight into who Vitalk
is reaching, and if for example it is being used as an adjunct
or follow on from therapy or as the only intervention being
accessed. This would oﬀer interesting learning for the wider
health system.
Due to the study being retrospective, we deﬁned engagement
level as the average daily number of responses sent by the
user, as this was the best measure based on the type of data
available. However, this did not consider that some conversations
are longer than others and the user may not be active every
day. Exploring alternative engagement metrics would be useful

Chatbot Engagement and Effectiveness
to enrich our understanding of how the chatbot is used and
would enable more comparison within the literature. Analyzing
engagement for each conversation would also allow a more
granular understanding of the impact of speciﬁc intervention
techniques on symptom change. This would allow us to explore
which are the most impactful components, whether this be the
chatbot, mood tracking, speciﬁc cognitive behavioral techniques
or a combination of all three.
CONCLUSION
As there is currently very little research on the use of chatbots
in mental healthcare, particularly within low- and middle-
income countries, these early ﬁndings are promising. The study
highlights the potential of using such an innovative tool to engage
users and oﬀer an eﬀective intervention to improve mental health
in Brazil’s general population. While ﬁndings show promise,
more rigorous research is required before any ﬁrm conclusions
can be drawn.
