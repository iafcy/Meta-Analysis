Abstract
This trial represents the final stage of the CARESSES project which aimed to develop and evaluate a culturally competent 
artificial intelligent system embedded into social robots to support older adult wellbeing. A parallel group, single-blind ran-
domised controlled trial was conducted across older adult care homes in England and Japan. Participants randomly allocated 
to the Experimental Group or Control Group 1 received a Pepper robot for up 18 h across 2 weeks. Two versions of the 
CARESSES artificial intelligence were tested: a fully culturally competent system (Experimental Group) and a more limited 
version (Control Group 1). Control Group 2 (Care As Usual) participants did not receive a robot. Quantitative outcomes 
of interest reported in the current paper were health-related quality of life (SF-36), loneliness (ULS-8), and perceptions 
of robotic cultural competence (CCATool-Robotics). Thirty-three residents completed all procedures. The difference in 
SF-36 Emotional Wellbeing scores between Experimental Group and Care As Usual participants over time was significant 
(F[1] = 6.614, sig = .019, ηp
2 = .258), as was the comparison between Any Robot used and Care As Usual (F[1] = 5.128, 
sig = .031, ηp
2 = .146). There were no significant changes in SF-36 physical health subscales. ULS-8 loneliness scores slightly 
improved among Experimental and Control Group 1 participants compared to Care As Usual participants, but this was not 
significant. This study brings new evidence which cautiously supports the value of culturally competent socially assistive 
robots in improving the psychological wellbeing of older adults residing in care settings.

1  Introduction
Health and social care sectors worldwide are facing rising 
pressures due to increased demand associated with aging 
populations, the many complex chronic conditions associ-
ated with this population, and now the impact of Covid-19. 
Therefore, exploring technological solutions that may allevi-
ate these pressures in a safe, ethical, acceptable and effective 
manner is vital.
The evidence regarding the impact of assistive robotics 
for older adults with care needs is emerging and, in rela-
tion to psychological wellbeing, appears encouraging. Abdi, 
Al-Hindawi, Ng, and Vizcaychipi’s [1] scoping review of 
socially assistive robots (SARs) within older adult health-
care settings assessed a range of outcomes from 33 studies,

totalling 1574 participants and 11 robots. Twenty-eight 
of these studies reported positive outcomes in relation to 
assisting older adults with cognitive training, companion-
ship, social facilitation and physiological therapy. However, 
the authors conclude that while the evidence for SARs is 
promising, many studies had methodological issues and 
most only focused upon small robots, in particular the PARO 
seal robot.
Systematic reviews by Pu, Moyle, Jones, and Todorovic 
[2] and Abbott et al. [3] reached similar conclusions. The 
former examined the effectiveness of SARs for older adults 
from data extracted from nine randomized controlled trials, 
concluding that, overall, social robots do have the potential 
to reduce anxiety, agitation, loneliness and improve qual-
ity of life for older adults despite non-significant results in 
their meta-analysis. Abbott et al.’s [3] review of qualitative 
and quantitative evidence in relation to the use of robopets 
(small animal‐like companion robots) in improving older 
adults’ wellbeing similarly reported that, on the whole, there 
is evidence of positive impact in relation to reduced agi-
tation and loneliness despite non-significance within their 
meta-analysis. Both reviews however also highlighted a large 
proportion of evidence has to date been produced by stud-
ies using the PARO robot only and that many studies were 
had a high risk of bias, particularly in relation to allocation 
concealment and blinding.
The current study, part of the CARESSES project, 
attempted to build on the current evidence-base by con-
ducting an exploratory RCT using a novel culturally com-
petent and autonomous artificial intelligence system [4, 5] 
developed earlier in the project, and embedded into the Pep-
per humanoid robot using (which has to date been largely 
overlooked by other similar trials to date) within older adult 
care settings in the UK and Japan. It is the first to employ a 
cross-national trial design, and among the first to explore the 
impact of culturally competent artificial intelligence embed-
ded into social robotics for enhancing health and wellbeing. 
The importance of cultural competence in improving patient 
outcomes is widely reported, particularly within the nursing 
literature [6, 7]. The concept refers to the ability of services 
to effectively meet and leverage the cultural and commu-
nication needs of clients [6]. Yet despite both its impor-
tance for enhancing patient-centred care and considerable 
debate around the conceptualisation and construction of 
‘cultural robotics’ [8–11], the concept has never previously 
been implemented and evaluated for its utility using a ran-
domised controlled trial design within healthcare settings. 
Cultural competence has also been linked with improved 
patient satisfaction [12] and acceptance [13, 14], which are 
two further key aspects of successful assistive robotics solu-
tions [15–17].
The CARESSES project was formed on the aforemen-
tioned points, namely that producing an artificial intelligence 
that embeds cultural competence to achieve patient-centred-
ness should boost SARs’ overall quality of user interactions, 
boost user acceptance, and that further research into produc-
ing safe, acceptable and effective socially assistive robotic 
solutions is needed so to help reduce the strain on the older 
adult care sector. The current paper specifically presents the 
trial’s quantitative results in relation to the intervention’s 
impact upon health-related quality of life, mental health 
and loneliness, when culturally competent socially assistive 
robots are used to supplement existing older adult care in 
long-term residential care settings.
2  Methods
2.1  Study Design and Setting
The CARESSES project involved a mixed-method, single-
blind (among participants receiving a robot only), parallel-
group experimental trial was employed within long-term 
older adult care homes in England and Japan during 2019. 
A pre-trial pilot study was first employed during late 2018 in 
one UK-based care home (which did not feature in the main 
trial). This established that our planned procedures were 
likely to be feasible and acceptable, and led to several pro-
cedural and technical improvements that were subsequently 
employed to enhance the main trial’s procedures.
The University of Bedfordshire’s Research Ethics Com-
mittee approved the UK-based study (Ref: UREC130) 
whereas the Human Subject Research Ethics Review Tech-
nical Subcommittee of the Japan Advanced Institute of Sci-
ence and Technology Life Science Committee approved the 
Japan-based study (Ref: 30–001). Full details on how ethical 
considerations, a key component of the overall project, were 
identified and managed can be found elsewhere [18–20]. 
An overview of the methodological approach follows below 
although full details pertaining to methodological proce-
dures (including the full suite of data collection measures 
used) have been published elsewhere [20].
2.2  Participants
Participants were recruited on the following basis: they were 
aged ≥ 65 years; resided in a single occupancy bedroom / 
bedroom area within their care home; were unlikely to 
express aggression towards themselves, the robot, and/or the 
researcher; possessed sufficient cognitive competence and 
sufficient physical health; and were able to verbally com-
municate in English (UK site only) or Japanese (Japan site 
only). Residents who self-identified themselves as primarily 
belonging to the English or Indian culture were recruited 
from UK-based care homes predominantly owned by 
Advinia Health Care (a full research partner in the project), 

247

1 3
whereas the Japanese participants were recruited from the 
HISUISUI assisted living facility in Japan.
To determine eligibility, care home staff first nominated 
residents (using initials only to protect anonymity) who they 
believed met the inclusion criteria. The research team then 
conducted brief structured interviews with staff who made 
nominations using the interRAI-Long Term Care Facility 
‘Cognitive Performance Scale’ and ‘Aggressive Behaviour 
Scale’ sub-scales [21] to assess cognitive competence and 
aggressiveness, and the FRAIL-NH scale [22] to assess 
frailty (a proxy to physical health). Residents who passed 
screening were then approached by a familiar care home 
staff member and introduced to a researcher who proceeded 
to invite the resident to participate.
2.3  Allocation and Blinding
Participants were allocated to one of following three groups 
using random sampling stratified by gender: 1. Experimen-
tal group (utilizing a CARESSES experimental robot); 2. 
Control Group 1 (utilizing a CARESSES control robot); and 
3. Control Group 2 (Care As Usual only). Participants who 
received a robot were blinded to which type of robot they 
received (the experimental or control robot). Care home staff 
were also blinded and there were no circumstances under 
which unblinding was permissible.
2.4  Trial Preparation
All research staff were subject to Disclosure & Barring 
Service checks (in the UK) and criminal record checks (in 
Japan). Researchers also completed a series of ethics and 
methods training, had weekly supervisory meetings and 
team support on an on-going basis. Care home staff were 
prepared via a brief presentation regarding what to expect 
during testing procedures, to request they continue their jobs 
as usual, to not rely upon the robot and—to help protect 
staff morale and concerns about the implications of techno-
logical interventions—reminded that the project is explor-
ing whether and how social robots may support outcomes 
in conjunction with current care rather than replacing care. 
Leaflets that contained this information were also made 
available.
Technical preparation and set-up procedures lasting 
approximately 1 h took place within each participant’s bed-
room prior to the first test either in the presence of the resi-
dent or without their presence if they preferred and provided 
consent for. The research team also had a brief preparatory 
meeting with participants allocated to receive a robot so to 
answer any remaining questions and to collect key personal 
information required to customise the robot (e.g. name, age 
and the contact information of close family members the 
robot could use to contact if the resident wished).
2.5  Boosting Standardisation
Several procedures took place to boost procedural standardi-
sation between the UK and Japan-based sites. This included 
regular joint planning meetings, a jointly produced, detailed 
protocol, using the same data collection instruments (includ-
ing pre-existing validated Japanese translations where pos-
sible), researchers from both sites undergoing the same 
series of training procedures, and step-by-step manuals to 
aid implementation of procedures.
2.6  Interventions
Participants allocated to the Experimental Group or Control 
Group 1 received a robot for two weeks. The robot hard-
ware used was ‘Pepper’, a robot manufactured by SoftBank 
Robotics (a study partner). It is 4 ft tall, weighs 63 lb and, 
due to its artificial appearance, is not disadvantaged by the 
Uncanny Valley effect [23].
The CARESSES Experimental Robot represented our 
best effort of producing robotic cultural competence. This 
involved (a) the robot being made aware of the particu-
lar participants’ cultural background; (b) pre-loading and 
employing the appropriate Cultural Knowledge Base (CKB) 
during testing (for which three such databases were devel-
oped for the English, Indian and Japanese cultures); (c) ini-
tially tailoring its interactions to a culture-specific level and 
then, during the second half of testing only, shifting towards 
more personalised interactions after learning more about the 
participants’ individual preferences and values; and (d) prop-
agating its learning of the participant in one particular area 
automatically to other related areas for improved predictions 
about the participants’ values and preferences.
The CARESSES Control Robot represented our attempt 
at ensuring clinical equipoise through producing a robot that 
was less culturally competent but also not culturally incom-
petent (where it might be reasonably likely to expect harm). 
This robot was therefore not pre-aware of the participant’s 
cultural background, it did not propagate its learning and 
it pre-loaded a generic and more limited CKB not tailored 
for any particular cultural profile. However, it did tailor its 
interactions to become more personalised over time.
An example to illustrate the differences between these 
versions is that for a participant who primarily identifies 
with the English culture, the Experimental Robot would load 
its English CKB upon first meeting the individual, initiate 
a greeting that is likely to be valued (e.g. hand waving), 
and to begin conversing in topics of conversation likely to 
be valued as encoded within the CKB (e.g. talking about 
football, Hollywood movies, Western music, World War 2). 
Conversations could then lead to the robot asking whether 
the participant might like to watch videos, listen to music 
or play a memory game associated with such interests. 

248

1 3
However, for the Control Robot, upon initially meeting the 
participant, would instead take a guess at an appropriate 
initial greeting gesture (e.g. a bow), and also make less accu-
rate guesses about what topics of conversation are likely 
to be valued (e.g. asking the English participant whether 
he/she enjoys Sumo Wrestling or Bollywood movies), also 
enquiring whether the participant might wish to watch, lis-
ten or play a game associated with these topics. During the 
second week of testing, both versions adjust to the specific 
responses obtained in relation to conversation topics (e.g. if 
the participant states he/she does not like football, then both 
versions remember this and explore other sports which he/
she may instead value). If the participant agrees that he/she 
likes Sumo Wrestling, the Experimental robot propagates 
this learning to also guess that he/she might also value other 
aspects of Japanese culture, whereas the Control Robot does 
not form such connections. A detailed explanation as to how 
the conversational interactions were developed and imple-
mented during the trial stage has been previously described 
[24, 25]
The development of the CARESSES experimental and 
control robots required finding innovative technological 
solutions in order to embed the robots with the required Arti-
ficial Intelligence, enabling the robot to interact with the par-
ticipants using its sensors and algorithms for data processing 
and reasoning. Indeed, the basic version of Pepper provides 
basic functionalities for interacting with people, but they 
need to be orchestrated through specific cognitive processes 
in order to enable a natural and engaging long-term inter-
action (given the aim was not to implement Wizard-of-Oz 
experiments but rather fully autonomous behaviour). A full 
explanation on how the artificial intelligence for the experi-
mental and control robots was developed for the purpose of 
testing and evaluation has been previously described [26].
2.7  Testing Procedures
Participants allocated to receive a robot had six sessions 
with the robot spread across two weeks at convenient times 
for the residents. Each session lasted for up to 3 h, with 
participants free to use the robot as much or as little as they 
wished during these times. The first session involved train-
ing the participant on how to use the robot and access the 
various functionalities, how to communicate with it, how to 
request assistance, and to answer remaining questions. The 
subsequent sessions involved the participants using the robot 
independently and privately (although for safety reasons, 
sessions were audio–video monitored by researchers nearby 
which participants were aware of). This involved the robot 
initially being placed near to the resident (within 3 feet) who 
could then specify further how close they wished the robot 
to remain positioned. Participants then used the robot to 
engage in conversation, listen to music, watch videos, play 
games, and to contact loved ones via text, video messages, 
video or audio calls. For safety reasons, during each session, 
the robot would remain in its initial position and not move 
around to follow the resident, although it would swivel to 
face the resident as necessary. After testing was complete, 
the research team spent additional time to support partici-
pants in case they expressed any sadness or distress from 
missing the robot. Control Group 2 (Care As Usual) partici-
pants did not engage in any tests and instead continued to 
receive their usual level and type of care.
2.8  Data Collection
The quantitative measures of health and wellbeing applied 
during 1–1 structured interviews with residents at baseline 
and post-intervention were: (1) Short Form (36) Health Sur-
vey version (SF-36) [27]. This is a widely used and validated 
health survey measuring eight dimensions of mental and 
physical health. This was completed by all participants; (2) 
Short Form UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-8) [28]. This is 
a widely used brief and validated measure of loneliness and 
was also completed by all participants.
The Cultural Competence Assessment Tool–Robotics 
(CCATool-Robotics) tool was employed to assess percep-
tions of robotic cultural competence. This is an adapted ver-
sion of the RCTSH Cultural Competence Assessment Tool 
(CCATool) [29]. This was completed by participants who 
received a robot at the one-week stage and post-interven-
tion. Measurements were taken during these time periods 
to assess to what degree perceptions of cultural competence 
changed after personalisation had occurred during week 2. 
All data were collected between February and November 
2019.
2.9  Data Analysis
Data were first checked for accuracy with any discrepancies 
audited, discussed and resolved. There were two instances 
of missing SF-36 data. This scale tolerates small amounts of 
missing data due to its use of mean average subscales [27] 
and as such no adjustment or imputation was needed. There 
was one instance of missing data regarding the ULS-8 data 
for which case mean substitution was used as it was contex-
tually appropriate to do so [30]. There were no missing data 
for the CCATool data.
Cronbach’s Alpha scores were good. Specifically, SF-36 
scored 0.758 and 0.741, while ULS-8 scored 0.756 and 
0.830 at baseline and post-intervention respectively.
Kolmogorov–Smirnov Normality Tests were conducted 
so to establish the normality of distribution among the 
dependent variables. Further, observation of scale variable 
differences between means and medians, kurtosis, skew val-
ues and histogram distributions were also observed. Overall, 

249

1 3
the data was assessed to be non-normally distributed and 
therefore non-parametric tests were applied. For within-
group repeated analyses, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were 
applied. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) tests were also 
carried out to measure and compare post-intervention out-
come scores across a grouping variable (controlling for base-
line scores). Grouping variables were constructed according 
to the group to which they were allocated to (Experimental 
Group, Control Group 1, Control Group 2). To expand the 
available analytical comparisons, an ‘Any Robot’ grouping 
variable was constructed which combined the data collected 
from the Experimental Group and Control Group 1 groups. 
Assessing the impact of perceived cultural competence on 
outcome change was made through assessing the differences 
in outcome scores between all available analytical com-
parisons (Exp Group vs Control Group 1, Exp Group vs 
Control Group 2, Control Group 1 vs Control Group 2, Exp 
Group + Control Group 1 [‘Any Robot’] vs Control Group 2).
Significance was set at p < 0.05, two-tailed. IBM SPSS 
Statistics v26 was used to run the analyses.
3  Results
3.1  Sample Characteristics
Nine care homes across England (n = 8) and Japan (n = 1) 
agreed to participate. Across these homes, 134 residents 
were nominated by care staff, 111 of whom passed screen-
ing. During initial recruitment procedures, it was observed 
that twelve further residents were unlikely to meet eligibil-
ity criteria (mainly due to perceived memory problems). Of 
the remaining 99 participants, 45 consented although ten 
subsequently dropped out prior to tests commencing. The 
remaining 35 participants commenced procedures although 
two participants (both allocated to control group 1) withdrew 
after 1 session (n = 1) and 2 sessions (n = 1). Thus, overall, 
33 residents fully participated who identified themselves as 
primarily belonging to English (n = 15), Indian (n = 15) or 
Japanese (n = 3) cultures. The recruitment rate (eligible and 
invited / participated) was therefore 35.4%. The main rea-
sons for declining participation were: ‘too tired’ (n = 14), 
no interest in project (n = 5), against the idea of robots in 
care homes (n = 3), too busy (n = 3) and family refused to 
consent (n = 3).
As can be seen in Tables 1 and 2, participants’ age ranged 
from 65—98 years (Mean = 81.9; SD = 9.82), the oldest 
of whom were Japanese (M = 86; SD = 9.54) followed by 
English (M = 83.67; SD = 10.3) and Indian participants 
(M = 79.4; SD = 9.36). The sample was predominantly 
female (n = 22), educational level was fairly equally dis-
tributed, and most participants were married at some point 
in their lives, with a large portion now widowed (n = 23).

Participants were of multiple specific religious faiths 
which for analytical purposes were categorised as Christian 
(n = 13), Hindu (n = 14) or other (this mostly consisted of 
atheist or ‘non-religious’ people) (n = 6). A full overview of 
participant characteristics per group allocation can be found 
in Table 3.
3.2  Quantitative outcome measures
Table 4 describes the overall mean total scores of each out-
come measure at initial assessment (either Baseline [T0] 
or after one week [T1] depending on tool) and post-inter-
vention [T2] per group. SF-36 mental health total mean 
scores significantly decreased for the Care As Usual group 
(T0: M = 76.22 [SD = 16.51]; T2: M = 63.30 [SD = 25.3]; 
p < 0.05), whereas participants receiving a robot did not 
observe such a reduction, and, in the case of the Experi-
mental group, a slight increase (T0: M = 77.59 [SD = 16.4]; 
T2: M = 78.39 [SD = 12.15]) was observed. For the SF-36 
mental health subscales, small score improvements for the 
Experimental Group can also be seen for the ‘role limita-
tions—emotional’ (i.e. the degree to which emotional health 
impacts upon one’s ability to conduct their usual roles) (T0: 
M = 86.11 [SD = 33.21]; T2: M = 90.28 [SD = 28.83]) and 
‘energy and fatigue’ subscales (T0: M = 57.92 [SD = 23.82]; 
T2: M = 60.00 [SD = 24.31]). However, a significant 
decrease in the ‘role limitations—emotional’ scale was also 
observed for the Control group across the two time points 
(T0: M = 87.88 [SD = 30.81]; T2: M = 60.60 [SD = 44.27]; 
Z = − 2.041, sig = 0.041). A numerical although non-sig-
nificant mean score increase was observed for the ‘emo-
tional wellbeing’ subscale in the Experimental group 
(T0: M = 83.00 [SD = 11.83]; T2: M = 89.33 [SD = 7.69]) 
whereas a considerable numerical decrease was observed 
for the Care As Usual group (T0: M = 82.80 [SD = 12.66]; 
T2: M = 67.60 [SD = 29.96]). As seen in Tables 5 and 6, 
ANCOVA comparisons revealed that the relative improve-
ment of ‘emotional wellbeing’ subscale scores between 
Experimental group participants and Care As Usual partici-
pants over time was significant (F[1] = 6.614, sig = 0.019, 
ηp
2 = 0.258), as was the comparison between Any Robot 
(i.e. participants in the Experimental or Control group) 
and Care As Usual (F[1] = 5.128, sig = 0.031, ηp
2 = 0.146). 
There were no significant changes in mean scores over time 
in SF-36 physical health subscales or with the ULS-8 loneli-
ness scores. However, for the latter, the ‘Any Robot’, Experi-
mental and Control groups experienced a slight reduction 
in loneliness severity between T0 and T2 (Exp group: T0: 
M = 14.9 [SD = 4.98]; T2: M = 14.3 [SD = 3.53], Control 
Group: T0: M = 18.8 [SD = 4.73]; T2: M = 17.2 [SD = 6.46]) 
whereas the Care As Usual group saw a slight increase in 
loneliness scores (T0: M = 15.7 [SD = 4.73]; T2: M = 16.5 
[SD = 5.4]).

Regarding perceptions of cultural competence, both ver-
sions of the robot produced fairly high levels of CCATool 
scores at both time points. However, the Experimental 
group’s robot performed better than the Control group’s 
robot at both time points in all but two of the subscales (Sub-
scale B: Cultural Sensitivity at T2 and Subscale D: Cultural 
Competence at T1). CCATool scores increased between T1 
and T2 for all scales within the Experimental group and all 
but in one scale for the Control group (Subscale D: Cul-
tural Competence—T1: M = 4.91 [SD = 1.51, T2: M = 4.45 
[SD = 1.51]). A full breakdown of CCATool scores can be 
seen in Table 7.
4  Discussion and Conclusions
While the findings are nuanced and are the product of an 
exploratory trial with several limitations, overall, the results 
cautiously provide further evidence in support of socially 
assistive robots being used to support older adults in care 
settings in a supplementary way, particularly in relation to 
mental health and emotional wellbeing.
Firstly, fairly large and positive score changes in the 
‘emotional wellbeing’ subscale were observed in both the 
Any Robot group and the Experimental group, whereas no 
change in score was observed for the Control group and a 
fairly large decrease in scores was observed for the Care As 
Usual group. When assessing the magnitude of change in 
scores over time between groups, the differences between 
improved scores in the Any Robot group compared to the 
Care As Usual group, and between the Experimental group 
compared to the Care As Usual group, were significant. This 
implies that using a CARESSES robot (ideally the Experi-
mental Robot) compared to not using any robot may indeed 
be likely to improve older adults’ emotional wellbeing, even 
only after a period of 2 weeks. Whether and to what degree 
this effect may hold or change over time is however currently 
unknown.
When examining the SF-36 mental health total scores, 
which may be argued to be a less precise way of measuring 
mental health than the ‘emotional wellbeing’ subscale alone 
[31, 32], the differences in score change over time between 
groups were close to meeting the statistical significance 
threshold (Experimental group vs Care As Usual group: 
F[1] = 4.249, sig = 0.054; Experimental group vs Control 
group: F[1] = 3.836, sig = 0.065). These findings lend fur-
ther support to the notion that having access to a version of 
the CARESSES intervention over 2 weeks may be likely to 
protect older adults’ mental health compared to not using 
any robot, and that the Experimental robot is likely to be 
particularly effective at this.
The Experimental robot also produced better scores 
during testing on the ‘role limitation—emotional’ SF-36

subscale compared to the both the Control and Care As 
Usual groups. This scale measures how limited indi-
viduals are in conducting their usual activities because 
of emotional problems. As can be observed in Table 3, 
the Experimental group mean scores slightly increased, 
whereas the Control group’s scores significantly decreased 
(Z = − 2.041; sig = 0.041) and the Care As Usual group 
also observed a large decrease (although a non-signifi-
cant one). These between-group differences were close 
to significance (Experimental group vs Care As Usual: 
F[1] = 3.993, sig = 0.06; Experimental group vs Control 
robot group: F[1] = 3.792, sig = 0.066). These findings 
therefore provide some further evidence that using a cul-
turally competent socially assistive robot may be likely to 
protect against mental health problems, including those 
which impact upon one’s everyday activities.
An SF-36 measure that both the versions of the robot per-
formed reasonably well in comparison to the Care As Usual 
group was ‘energy and fatigue’, with both robot groups 
showing a slight increase in scores over time whereas the 
Care As Usual group had a larger, although non-significant 
numerical decrease. The reasons for why the robots may 
have protected participants’ energy levels is difficult to 
interpret although it may be that gains in mental health and 
emotional wellbeing boosted energy (indeed, a significant 
correlation between emotional wellbeing and energy/fatigue 
can be observed: rho = 0.499; sig = 0.003).
The intervention was not able to produce any discernible 
impact in terms of physical health. These findings are unsur-
prising; the intervention was designed with a stronger focus 
on boosting mental health through culturally competent 
interactions rather than boosting physical health. The robots

did offer participants the option to watch exercise videos and 
in a few cases the participants attempted to copy some of the 
basic exercises they were watching. However, clearly the 
offer of videos and providing tips about improving physical 
health was not effective in producing clear physical health 
improvements in such a short period of time and with what 
is a frail and physically disabled population. It should also be 
noted that there are limitations associated with the hardware 
given that the Pepper robot is not designed or able to provide 
any physical assistance. The Pepper hardware is also not able 
to dispense medication which in theory could have boosted 
medication adherence and thus physical health may have 
been improved. Furthermore, it may have been helpful for 
the system to have included reminders about taking medi-
cation; however, this feature was not made available during 
testing due to ethical concerns.
With regard to loneliness, ULS-8 baseline scores for the 
study samples were identified to be fairly high, which for this 
population is unsurprising [33, 34]. During testing, severity 
of loneliness slightly increased in the Care As Usual group 
whereas slight decreases were observed for the Experimental 
and Control Robot groups. These results can be interpreted 
in several ways. First, they indicate that using a culturally 
competent robot may be reasonably unlikely to increase 
loneliness compared to care as usual. Second, they indicate 
that, even over a short period of time (2 weeks), a slight 
reduction in loneliness may be observed. If these trends 
were to continue over time, these differences may become 
more meaningful. Third, if the full CARESSES culturally 
competent software was made available to the Experimental 
robot from the outset (rather than only during the second 
week of testing), the improvements in outcomes related to 
loneliness (and mental health) would likely have been even 
larger. However, it is clear that more work to improve the 
depth and impact of the system to drive down loneliness is 
required. Such improvements may tie-in with enhancements 
to the ‘social functioning’ part of the system, so that future 
systems can have a stronger focus on improving the social 
capital and circumstances of the individual [35].
Finally, with regard to perception of cultural compe-
tence, the results of the CCATool show that after one and 
two weeks of use, both the Experimental group’s robot 
and Control group’s robot were, overall, perceived to be 
reasonably culturally competent. Both versions of the 
robot were perceived to be more culturally competent 
after two weeks than compared to after one week, although 
the Experimental group showed greater improvement in 
scores overall. This may suggest that the changes made to 
the system after week 1, to increase cultural competence 
of the system (e.g. by enabling personalisation towards 
individual cultural values), had a positive impact upon per-
ceptions of cultural competence and, as expected, a greater 
level of impact with the Experimental group participants.

However, it may also be that increased scores over time 
were due to the participants’ growing understanding of 
how to use the system more as time passed. Or, of course, 
a combination of both these explanations.
There are a number of study limitations. Firstly, 
although the trial represents one of the most rigorous 
and largest of its kind to date, particularly with respect to 
cross-cultural assessments and intervention intensity, sam-
ple sizes were not statistically powered and may be viewed 
as fairly small (particularly the Japanese sample), con-
sequently reducing generalisability. However, given that 
each test required two weeks, that only two robots were 
available to us, that on average only four residents per care 
home were eligible and agreed to participate and that, to 
achieve the study sample size spanned 10 months (across 
two countries) with many costs, collecting larger samples 
was not feasible within the overall project timescale. Fur-
thermore, even though every attempt to control key poten-
tial confounding variables was made, and that gender-
based stratified random group allocation was employed, 
it is likely that some confounding variables were present. 
Further, a likely source of bias was that participants using 
a robot were made aware that they were being audio and 
video monitored by researchers which may have inhibited 
or influenced some of their conversations and interactions 
with the robot. This was a bias that the research team could 
not fully overcome given that it was critical to monitor 
participants to ensure their safety and to intervene when 
technical problems occurred. Another potential bias could 
have been that some participants in Control Group 2 who 
wanted a robot but did not receive one had their mood 
negatively affected by being aware of their peers receiving 
one. Finally, it should be noted that this trial was based on 
a particular type of population, namely older adults resid-
ing in care settings without severe dementia, severe mental 
health problems or severe frailty (that would require hos-
pitalisation). Therefore, inferences made on the potential 
impact of the system on other populations based upon the 
current system should be treated with caution, particularly 
older adults with severe levels of dementia and frailty.
Overall, the CARESSES trial represents one of the largest 
attempts to explore the impact of autonomous social robots 
on the health and wellbeing of older adults within social 
care settings, and the first to assess the role of culturally 
competent systems. Despite the study limitations, it can be 
cautiously concluded that the CARESSES system did not 
fare worse than care as usual in most of the study outcome 
measures and, particularly in relation to mental health and 
emotional wellbeing, it was able to produce significantly 
better outcomes. Further research is needed to confirm and 
build upon these findings, particularly those driven by sta-
tistically powered sample sizes, and to assess whether and 
how trends change beyond a 2-week period only.
