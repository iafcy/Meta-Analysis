            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted access to treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs), while alcohol and cannabis retail sales increased. During the pandemic, we tested a tailored digital health solution, Woebot-SUDs (W-SUDs), for reducing substance misuse.\n## METHODS\nIn a randomized controlled trial, we compared W-SUDs for 8 weeks to a waitlist control. U.S. adults (N = 180) who screened positive for substance misuse (CAGE-AID>1) were enrolled June-August 2020. The primary outcome was the change in past-month substance use occasions from baseline to end-of-treatment (EOT). Study retention was 84%. General linear models tested group differences in baseline-to-EOT change scores, adjusting for baseline differences and attrition.\n## RESULTS\nAt baseline, the sample (age M = 40, SD = 12, 65% female, 68% non-Hispanic white) averaged 30.2 (SD = 18.6) substance occasions in the past month. Most (77%) reported alcohol problems, 28% cannabis, and 45% multiple substances; 46% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Treatment participants averaged 920 in-app text messages (SD = 892, Median = 701); 96% of completed lessons were rated positively; and 88% would recommend W-SUDs. Relative to waitlist, W-SUDs participants significantly reduced past-month substance use occasions (M = -9.1, SE = 2.0 vs. M = -3.3, SE = 1.8; p = .039). Secondary substance use and mood outcomes did not change significantly by group; however, reductions in substance use occasions correlated significantly with increased confidence and fewer substance use problems, cravings, depression and anxiety symptoms, and pandemic-related mental health effects (p-value<.05).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nW-SUDs was associated with significant reductions in substance use occasions. Reduction in substance use occasions was associated with better outcomes, including improved mental health. W-SUDs satisfaction was high.\n",

A number of such interventions have been found to be effective, especially for mild to moderate cases. They largely rely on psychoeducation and 'homework tasks', and are specific to certain diagnoses (e.g. depression).\n## AIMS\nThis paper presents the results of a web-based randomized controlled trial of Manage Your Life Online (MYLO), a program that uses artificial intelligence to engage the participant in a conversation across any problem topic.\n## METHOD\nHealthy volunteers (n = 213) completed a baseline questionnaire and were randomized to the MYLO program or to an active control condition where they used the program ELIZA, which emulates a Rogerian psychotherapist. Participants completed a single session before completing post-study and 2-week follow-up measures.\n## RESULTS\nAnalyses were per protocol with intent to follow-up. Both programs were associated with improvements in problem distress, anxiety and depression post-intervention, and again 2 weeks later, but MYLO was not found to be more effective than ELIZA. MYLO was rated as significantly more helpful than ELIZA, but there was no main effect of intervention on problem resolution.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nFindings are consistent with those of a previous smaller, laboratory-based trial and provide support for the acceptability and effectiveness of MYLO delivered over the internet for a non-clinical sample. The lack of a no-treatment control condition means that the effect of spontaneous recovery cannot be ruled out.\n",

This study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of using an artificial intelligence-based chatbot to improve smile and speech in PD. Further, we explored the potential predictive value of objective face and speech parameters for motor symptoms, cognition, and mood.\n## METHODS\nIn this open-label randomized study, we collected a series of face and conversational speech samples from 20 participants with PD in weekly teleconsultation sessions for 5 months. We investigated the effect of daily chatbot conversations on smile and speech features, then we investigated whether smile and speech features could predict motor, cognitive, and mood status.\n## RESULTS\nA repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed that the chatbot conversations had a significant interaction effect on the mean and standard deviation of the smile index during smile sections (both P\u00a0=\u00a0.02), maximum duration of the initial rise of the smile index (P\u00a0=\u00a0.04), and frequency of filler words (P\u00a0=\u00a0.04), but no significant interaction effects were observed for clinical measurements including motor, cognition, depression, and quality of life. Explorative analysis using statistical and machine-learning models revealed that the smile indices and several speech features were associated with motor symptoms, cognition, and mood in PD.\n## CONCLUSION\nAn artificial intelligence-based chatbot may positively affect smile and speech in PD.

In this experiment, which was designed to study the acquaintance process, we randomly assigned 417 participants into three conditions: face-to-face (FTF) chat with a human, online chat with a human, and online chat with a commercially-available, emotionally-responsive chatbot, Replika. After a 20-min getting-acquainted chat, participants reported their affective state and relational evaluations of the chat. Additionally, all chats were recorded and text analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program. In all conditions, participants reported moderate levels of positive emotions and low levels of negative emotions. Those who chatted FTF with a human reported significantly more negative emotions than those who chatted with a bot. However, those who chatted with a human also reported more homophily with and liking of their chat partner and that their partner was more responsive. Meanwhile, participants had fewest conversational concerns with the chatbot. These findings have implications for future computer-mediated interaction studies: conversations with chatbots appear to have different affordances and effects on chatter enjoyment and conversational concerns in getting-acquainted contexts. These results may help designers improve reception and marketability for chatbots in consumer markets.",

As a result, primary care providers (PCPs) are often called on to provide first-line care for these youth. Digital health interventions can extend mental health specialty care, but few are evidence based. We evaluated the feasibility of delivering an evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) app with an embedded conversational agent to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to symptomatic adolescents presenting in primary care settings during the pandemic.\n## OBJECTIVE\nIn this 12-week pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility of delivering the app-based intervention to adolescents aged 13 to 17 years with moderate depressive symptoms who were treated in a practice-based research network (PBRN) of academically affiliated primary care clinics. We also obtained preliminary estimates of app acceptability, effectiveness, and usability.\n## METHODS\nThis small, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated depressive symptom severity in adolescents randomized to the app or to a wait list control condition. The primary end point was depression severity at 4-weeks, measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Data on acceptability, feasibility, and usability were collected from adolescents and their parent or legal guardian. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 PCPs from 11 PBRN clinics to identify facilitators and barriers to incorporating mental health apps in treatment planning for adolescents with depression and anxiety.\n## RESULTS\nThe pilot randomized 18 participants to the app (n=10, 56%) or to a wait list control condition (n=8, 44%); 17 participants were included in the analysis, and 1 became ineligible upon chart review due to lack of eligibility based on documented diagnosis. The overall sample was predominantly female (15/17, 88%), White (15/17, 88%), and privately insured (15/17, 88%). Mean PHQ-9 scores at 4 weeks decreased by 3.3 points in the active treatment group (representing a shift in mean depression score from moderate to mild symptom severity categories) and 2 points in the wait list control group (no shift in symptom severity category). Teen- and parent-reported usability, feasibility, and acceptability of the app was high. PCPs reported preference for introducing mHealth interventions like the one in this study early in the course of care for individuals presenting with mild or moderate symptoms.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn this small study, we demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety of using a CBT-based chatbot for adolescents presenting with moderate depressive symptoms in a network of PBRN-based primary care clinics. This pilot study could not establish effectiveness, but our results suggest that further study in a larger pediatric population is warranted.

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nStudents in need of mental health care face many barriers including cost, location, availability, and stigma. Studies show that computer-assisted therapy and 1 conversational chatbot delivering cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offer a less-intensive and more cost-effective alternative for treating depression and anxiety. Although CBT is one of the most effective treatment methods, applying an integrative approach has been linked to equally effective posttreatment improvement. Integrative psychological artificial intelligence (AI) offers a scalable solution as the demand for affordable, convenient, lasting, and secure support grows.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of using an integrative psychological AI, Tess, to reduce self-identified symptoms of depression and anxiety in college students.\n## METHODS\nIn this randomized controlled trial, 75 participants were recruited from 15 universities across the United States. All participants completed Web-based surveys, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) at baseline and 2 to 4 weeks later (T2). The 2 test groups consisted of 50 participants in total and were randomized to receive unlimited access to Tess for either 2 weeks (n=24) or 4 weeks (n=26). The information-only control group participants (n=24) received an electronic link to the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) eBook on depression among college students and were only granted access to Tess after completion of the study.\n## RESULTS\nA sample of 74 participants completed this study with 0% attrition from the test group and less than 1% attrition from the control group (1/24). The average age of participants was 22.9 years, with 70% of participants being female (52/74), mostly Asian (37/74, 51%), and white (32/74, 41%). Group 1 received unlimited access to Tess, with daily check-ins for 2 weeks. Group 2 received unlimited access to Tess with biweekly check-ins for 4 weeks. The information-only control group was provided with an electronic link to the NIMH's eBook. Multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted. We used an alpha level of .05 for all statistical tests. Results revealed a statistically significant difference between the control group and group 1, such that group 1 reported a significant reduction in symptoms of depression as measured by the PHQ-9 (P=.03), whereas those in the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found between the control group and both test groups 1 and 2 for symptoms of anxiety as measured by the GAD-7. Group 1 (P=.045) and group 2 (P=.02) reported a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety, whereas the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found on the PANAS between the control group and group 1 (P=.03) and suggests that Tess did impact scores.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis study offers evidence that AI can serve as a cost-effective and accessible therapeutic agent. Although not designed to appropriate the role of a trained therapist, integrative psychological AI emerges as a feasible option for delivering support.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nInternational Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number: ISRCTN61214172; https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN61214172.\n",

Users' well-being levels were tracked using the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index throughout the engagement with service. A 1-tailed paired samples t test was used to assess well-being levels before and after usage, and hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine the change in symptoms over time.\n## RESULTS\nThe median well-being score at the last measurement was higher (median 52) than that at the start of the intervention (median 40), indicating a significant improvement (W=2682927; P<.001).

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nSymptoms of depression and anxiety commonly coexist with chronic musculoskeletal pain, and when this occurs, standard orthopedic treatment is less effective. However, mental health intervention is not yet a routine part of standard orthopedic treatment, in part because of access-related barriers. Digital mental health intervention is a potential scalable resource that could be feasibly incorporated into orthopedic care.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study's primary purpose was to assess the feasibility of introducing a digital mental health intervention (Wysa) in an outpatient orthopedic setting to patients with coexisting symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. The secondary purpose was to perform a preliminary effectiveness analysis of the intervention.\n## METHODS\nIn this single-arm, prospective cohort study, participants included adult patients (18 years and older) who presented to a nonsurgical orthopedic specialist at a single tertiary care academic center for evaluation of a musculoskeletal condition and who self-reported symptoms of depression and/or anxiety (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Depression and/or Anxiety score \u226555). Face-to-face enrollment was performed by a research coordinator immediately after the participant's encounter with an orthopedic clinician. Participants were provided 2 months of access to a mobile app called Wysa, which is an established, multicomponent digital mental health intervention that uses chatbot technology and text-based access to human counselors to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness training, and sleep tools, among other features. For this study, Wysa access also included novel, behavioral activation-based features specifically developed for users with chronic pain. Primary feasibility outcomes included the study recruitment rate, retention rate, and engagement rate with Wysa (defined as engagement with a therapeutic Wysa tool at least once during the study period). Secondary effectiveness outcomes were between-group differences in mean longitudinal PROMIS mental and physical health score changes at 2-month follow-up between high and low Wysa users, defined by a median split.\n## RESULTS\nThe recruitment rate was 29.3% (61/208), retention rate was 84% (51/61), and engagement rate was 72% (44/61). Compared to low users, high users reported greater improvement in PROMIS Anxiety scores (between-group difference -4.2 points, 95% CI -8.1 to -0.2; P=.04) at the 2-month follow-up. Between-group differences in PROMIS Depression (-3.2 points, 95% CI -7.5 to 1.2; P=.15) and Pain Interference scores (-2.3 points, 95% CI -6.3 to 1.7; P=.26) favored high users but did not meet statistical significance. Improvements in PROMIS Physical Function scores were comparable between groups.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDelivery of a digital mental health intervention within the context of orthopedic care is feasible and has the potential to improve mental health and pain-related impairment to a clinically meaningful degree. Participants' engagement rates exceeded industry standards, and additional opportunities to improve recruitment and retention were identified. Further pilot study followed by a definitive, randomized controlled trial is warranted.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04640090; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04640090.\n",

            "abstract": "Mental health issues are at the forefront of healthcare challenges facing contemporary human society. These issues are most prevalent among working-age people, impacting negatively on the individual, his/her family, workplace, community, and the economy. Conventional mental healthcare services, although highly effective, cannot be scaled up to address the increasing demand from affected individuals, as evidenced in the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversational agents, or chatbots, are a recent technological innovation that has been successfully adapted for mental healthcare as a scalable platform of cross-platform smartphone applications that provides first-level support for such individuals. Despite this disposition, mental health chatbots in the extant literature and practice are limited in terms of the therapy provided and the level of personalisation. For instance, most chatbots extend Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) into predefined conversational pathways that are generic and ineffective in recurrent use. In this paper, we postulate that Behavioural Activation (BA) therapy and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are more effectively materialised in a chatbot setting to provide recurrent emotional support, personalised assistance, and remote mental health monitoring. We present the design and development of our BA-based AI chatbot, followed by its participatory evaluation in a pilot study setting that confirmed its effectiveness in providing support for individuals with mental health issues.\n",

Woebot is a mental health digital solution informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and built upon an artificial intelligence-driven platform to deliver tailored content to users. In a previous 2-week randomized controlled trial, Woebot alleviated depressive symptoms.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study aims to adapt Woebot for the treatment of substance use disorders (W-SUDs) and examine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy.\n## METHODS\nAmerican adults (aged 18-65 years) who screened positive for substance misuse without major health contraindications were recruited from online sources and flyers and enrolled between March 27 and May 6, 2020. In a single-group pre/postdesign, all participants received W-SUDs for 8 weeks. W-SUDs provided mood, craving, and pain tracking and modules (psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapeutic tools) using elements of dialectical behavior therapy and motivational interviewing. Paired samples t tests and McNemar nonparametric tests were used to examine within-subject changes from pre- to posttreatment on measures of substance use, confidence, cravings, mood, and pain.\n## RESULTS\nThe sample (N=101) had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD 10.0), and 75.2% (76/101) of the participants were female, 78.2% (79/101) were non-Hispanic White, and 72.3% (73/101) were employed. Participants' W-SUDs use averaged 15.7 (SD 14.2) days, 12.1 (SD 8.3) modules, and 600.7 (SD 556.5) sent messages. About 94% (562/598) of all completed psychoeducational lessons were rated positively. From treatment start to end, in-app craving ratings were reduced by half (87/101, 86.1% reporting cravings in the app; odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.32-0.73). Posttreatment assessment completion was 50.5% (51/101), with better retention among those who initially screened higher on substance misuse. From pre- to posttreatment, confidence to resist urges to use substances significantly increased (mean score change +16.9, SD 21.4; P<.001), whereas past month substance use occasions (mean change -9.3, SD 14.1; P<.001) and scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (mean change -1.3, SD 2.6; P<.001), 10-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (mean change -1.2, SD 2.0; P<.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item (mean change 2.1, SD 5.2; P=.005), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (mean change -2.3, SD 4.7; P=.001), and cravings scale (68.6% vs 47.1% moderate to extreme; P=.01) significantly decreased. Most participants would recommend W-SUDs to a friend (39/51, 76%) and reported receiving the service they desired (41/51, 80%). Fewer felt W-SUDs met most or all of their needs (22/51, 43%).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nW-SUDs was feasible to deliver, engaging, and acceptable and was associated with significant improvements in substance use, confidence, cravings, depression, and anxiety. Study attrition was high. Future research will evaluate W-SUDs in a randomized controlled trial with a more diverse sample and with the use of greater study retention strategies.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04096001; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04096001.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nMotivation is a core component of diabetes self-management because it allows adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) to adhere to clinical recommendations. In this context, virtual coaches (VCs) have assumed a central role in supporting and treating common barriers related to adherence. However, most of them are mainly focused on medical and physical purposes, such as the monitoring of blood glucose levels or following a healthy diet.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis proof-of-concept study aims to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of a VC intervention for psychosocial support before and after the intervention and at follow-up. The intent of this VC is to motivate adults with type 1 DM and type 2 DM to adopt and cultivate healthy coping strategies to reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and diabetes-related emotional distress, while also improving their well-being.\n## METHODS\nA total of 13 Italian adults with DM (18-51 years) interacted with a VC, called Motibot (motivational bot) using the Telegram messaging app. The interaction covered 12 sessions, each lasting 10 to 20 minutes, during which the user could dialogue with the VC by inputting text or tapping an option on their smartphone screen. Motibot is developed within the transtheoretical model of change to deliver the most appropriate psychoeducational intervention based on the user's motivation to change.\n## RESULTS\nResults showed that over the 12 sessions, there were no significant changes before and after the intervention and at follow-up regarding psychosocial factors. However, most users showed a downward trend over the 3 time periods in depression and anxiety symptoms, thereby presenting good psychological well-being and no diabetes-related emotional distress. In addition, users felt motivated, involved, encouraged, emotionally understood, and stimulated by Motibot during the interaction. Indeed, the analyses of semistructured interviews, using a text mining approach, showed that most users reported a perceived reduction in anxiety, depression, and/or stress symptoms. Moreover, users indicated the usefulness of Motibot in supporting and motivating them to find a mindful moment for themselves and to reflect on their own emotions.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nMotibot was well accepted by users, particularly because of the inclusion of mindfulness practices, which motivated them to adopt healthy coping skills. To this extent, Motibot provided psychosocial support for adults with DM, particularly for those with mild and moderate symptoms, whereas those with severe symptoms may benefit more from face-to-face psychotherapy.\n",

Most of these social robots have provided timely stimuli to the elderly at home and in care centres, including keeping them active and boosting their mood. However, previous investigations have registered shortcomings in these robots, particularly in their ability to satisfy an essential human need: the need for companionship. Reports show that the elderly tend to lose interests in these social robots after the initial excitement as the novelty wears out and the monotonous familiarity becomes all too familiar. This paper presents our research facilitating conversations between a social humanoid robot, Nadine, and cognitively impaired elderly at a nursing home. We analysed the effectiveness of human-humanoid interactions between our robot and 14 elderly over 29 sessions. We used both objective tools (based on computer vision methods) and subjective tools (based on observational scales) to evaluate the recorded videos. Our findings showed that our subjects engaged positively with Nadine, suggesting that their interaction with the robot could improve their well-being by compensating for some of their emotional, cognitive, and psychosocial deficiencies.

Mental health chatbots are a highly scalable method to address this gap. Manage Your Life Online (MYLO) is an artificially intelligent chatbot that emulates the method of levels therapy. Method of levels is a therapy that uses curious questioning to support the sustained awareness and exploration of current problems.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a co-designed interface for MYLO in young people aged 16 to 24 years with mental health problems.\n## METHODS\nAn iterative co-design phase occurred over 4 months, in which feedback was elicited from a group of young people (n=7) with lived experiences of mental health issues. This resulted in the development of a progressive web application version of MYLO that could be used on mobile phones. We conducted a case series to assess the feasibility and acceptability of MYLO in 13 young people over 2 weeks. During this time, the participants tested MYLO and completed surveys including clinical outcomes and acceptability measures. We then conducted focus groups and interviews and used thematic analysis to obtain feedback on MYLO and identify recommendations for further improvements.\n## RESULTS\nMost participants were positive about their experience of using MYLO and would recommend MYLO to others. The participants enjoyed the simplicity of the interface, found it easy to use, and rated it as acceptable using the System Usability Scale. Inspection of the use data found evidence that MYLO can learn and adapt its questioning in response to user input. We found a large effect size for the decrease in participants' problem-related distress and a medium effect size for the increase in their self-reported tendency to resolve goal conflicts (the proposed mechanism of change) in the testing phase. Some patients also experienced a reliable change in their clinical outcome measures over the 2 weeks.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWe established the feasibility and acceptability of MYLO. The initial outcomes suggest that MYLO has the potential to support the mental health of young people and help them resolve their own problems. We aim to establish whether the use of MYLO leads to a meaningful reduction in participants' symptoms of depression and anxiety and whether these are maintained over time by conducting a randomized controlled evaluation trial.\n",

            "abstract": "The amount of academic workload in schools can cause students to experience stress and become more susceptible to mental health problems. However, because of fear of societal stigma, students may find it more difficult to approach others about the stress they experience. A chatbot can provide an alternative avenue for students to freely share the stressful situations they are experiencing. In this study, we investigated the use of Woebot as a mechanism to help senior high school students alleviate stress from academic workload. 25 participants who engaged in daily conversations with Woebot for a two-week period rated the chatbot\u2019s likeness to a human with a mean score of 5.56 out of 8, while its ability to understand the feelings of the participants and empathize with them had a mean score of 5.61. An analysis of the chat logs showed that the participants valued Woebot\u2019s lessons and stories while they faced challenges in cases when the chatbot generated inappropriate responses. We discuss our findings and provide design suggestions that could make conversational agents like Woebot be more useful in helping the general student population cope with stress.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we created an end-to-end autonomous robotic platform to give emotional support to children in long-term, multi-session interactions. Using a mood estimation algorithm based on visual cues of the user\u2019s behaviors through their facial expressions and body posture, a multi-dimensional model predicts a qualitative measure of the subject\u2019s affective state. Using a novel Interactive Reinforcement Learning algorithm, the robot is able to learn over several sessions the social profile of the user, adjusting its behavior to match their preferences. Although the robot is completely autonomous, a third party can optionally provide feedback to the robot through an additional UI to accelerate its learning of the user\u2019s preferences. To validate the proposed methodology, we evaluated the impact of the robot on elementary school aged children in a long-term, multi-session interaction setting. Our findings show that using this methodology, the robot is able to learn the social profile of the users over a number of sessions, either with or without external feedback as well as maintain the user in a positive mood, as shown by the consistently positive rewards received by the robot using our proposed learning algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Technological advancements re-shaped user-product interactions by enabling people to make conversation with interactive systems. This new form of interaction led designers to create a new type of user interface: Conversational User Interface (CUI). Expensive psychological therapy fees and people\u2019s increased awareness related to importance of well-being attracted the interactive system developers to create a domain specific Conversational Agent, which is particularly focusing on psychological terapy and has CUI. In order to maintain user engagement and sustain usage, design of such systems is important. However, existing design guidelines for Conversational Agents are limited and focus on business functions of these agents; however, conversational experience should be the main focus for designers to sustain user engagement and support people\u2019s well-being.\nThe aim of this research is to explore design qualities of Conversational Agent\u2019s that focuses on enhancing people\u2019s subjective well-being, to accomplish sustained usage and engagement with the conversational agent and propose guidance for designing such agents. For this purpose, interviews were conducted with users. Woebot, a Conversational Agent, which is designed for promoting people\u2019s subjective well-being was selected as a case for the study and evaluated by 16 participants. The interpretations of the participants were obtained by semi- structured and in-depth interviews. Through analysing the results of the interviews, improvement suggestions are presented regarding system operations and functionality in terms of its attractiveness, perspicuity, effectiveness, stimulation, dependability, efficiency and novelty. Lastly, the study provides insights that would affect users\u2019 engagement and overall experience.",

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted daily lives globally, causing social isolation that impacted the mental health and well-being of the population, particularly the students. With the shortage of accessible healthcare facilities and resources, the community is turning to technology-based mental healthcare interventions such as telemental health systems, online support groups, self-service web and mobile applications, and chatbots. In this study, we assessed the extent in which the daily interaction with the chatbot Wysa can influence the well-being of students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students evaluated the usability and effectiveness of Wysa\u2019s clinical interventions which include the talk therapy, gratitude journal, self-care practices and mindfulness exercise throughout the duration of the week-long experiment. They provided their perception on the quality of the chatbot\u2019s response, affect and human-likeness, and shared attributes that would motivate self-disclosure and openness to communicate with the chatbot. Our findings can shed insights on the effectiveness of mental health apps as a coping mechanism in a time of social isolation and provide suggestions on how such technologies can be improved in order to maximize well-being benefits as well as user satisfaction.",

            "abstract": "## Background\nDigital mental health interventions (DMHIs) may reduce treatment access issues for those experiencing depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. DMHIs that incorporate relational agents may ofer unique ways to engage and respond to users and to potentially help reduce provider burden. This study tested Woebot for Mood & Anxiety (W-MA-02), a DMHI that employs Woebot, a relational agent that incorporates elements of several evidence-based psychotherapies, among those with baseline clinical levels of depressive or anxiety symptoms. Changes in self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms over 8 weeks were measured, along with the association between each of these outcomes and demographic and clinical characteristics. ## Methods\nThis exploratory, single-arm, 8-week study of 256 adults yielded non-mutually exclusive subsamples with either clinical levels of depressive or anxiety symptoms at baseline. Week 8 Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) changes were measured in the depressive subsample (PHQ-8\u226510). Week 8 Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) changes were measured in the anxiety subsample (GAD-7\u226510). Demographic and clinical characteristics were exam\u2011ined in association with symptom changes via bivariate and multiple regression models adjusted for W-MA-02 utiliza\u2011tion. Characteristics included age, sex at birth, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, sexual orientation, employ\u2011ment status, health insurance, baseline levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and concurrent psychotherapeutic or psychotropic medication treatments during the study. ## Results\nBoth the depressive and anxiety subsamples were predominantly female, educated, non-Hispanic white, and averaged 38 and 37 years of age, respectively. The depressive subsample had signifcant reductions in depres\u2011sive symptoms at Week 8 (mean change=\u20147.28, SD=5.91, Cohen\u2019s d=-1.23, p<0.01); the anxiety subsample had signifcant reductions in anxiety symptoms at Week 8 (mean change=-7.45, SD=5.99, Cohen\u2019s d=-1.24, p<0.01). No signifcant associations were found between sex at birth, age, employment status, educational background and Week 8 symptom changes. Signifcant associations between depressive and anxiety symptom outcomes and sexual orientation, marital status, concurrent mental health treatment, and baseline symptom severity were found.",

            "abstract": "College students encounter various types of stresses in school due to schoolwork, personal relationships, health issues, and future career concerns. Some students are susceptible to the strikes of failures and are inexperienced with or fearful of dealing with setbacks. When these negative emotions gradually accumulate without resolution, they can cause long-term negative effects on students\u2019 physical and mental health. Some potential health problems include depression, anxiety, and disorders such as eating disorders. Universities commonly offer counseling services; however, the demand often exceeds the counseling capacities due to limited numbers of counsellors/psychologists. Thus, students may not receive immediate counseling or treatments. If students are not treated, some repercussions may lead to severe abnormal behavior and even suicide. In this study, combining immersive virtual reality (VR) technique with psychological knowledge base, we developed a VR empathy-centric counseling chatbot (VRECC) that can complementarily support troubled students when counsellors cannot provide immediate support. Through multi-turn (verbal or text) conversations with the chatbot, the system can demonstrate empathy and give therapist-like responses to the users. During the study, more than 120 students were required to complete a questionnaire and 34 subjects with an above-median stress level were randomly drawn for the VRECC experiment. We observed decreasing average stress level and psychological sensitivity scores among subjects after the experiment. Although the system did not yield improvement in life-impact scores (e.g., behavioral and physical impacts), the significant outcomes of lowering stress level and psychological sensitivity have given us a very positive outlook for continuing to integrate VR, AI sentimental natural language process, and counseling chatbot for advanced VRECC research in helping students improve their psychological well-being and life quality at schools.",

A smart shirt is developed to collect the ECG signal from the human body. The robot assistant has the ability to engage in verbal conversations with humans. Recurrence Quantitative Analysis (RQA) is used to extract ECG features for emotion classification purpose. Along with our own dataset, two other public datasets, RECOLA and DECAF, are also used to evaluate our methodology.
