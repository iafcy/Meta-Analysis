            "abstract": "Melanoma, a very severe form of skin cancer, spreads quickly and has a high mortality rate if not treated early. Recently, machine learning, deep learning, and other related technologies have been successfully applied to computer-aided diagnostic tasks of skin lesions. However, some issues in terms of image feature extraction and imbalanced data need to be addressed. Based on a method for manually annotating image features by dermatologists, we developed a melanoma detection model with four improvement strategies, including applying the transfer learning technique to automatically extract image features, adding gender and age metadata, using an oversampling technique for imbalanced data, and comparing machine learning algorithms. According to the experimental results, the improved strategies proposed in this study have statistically significant performance improvement effects. In particular, our proposed ensemble model can outperform previous related models."

Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide quantitative information regarding the morphology and textural features of lesions. This study attempted to use AI to evaluate the ultrasonic images of PTs and FAs and to explore the diagnostic performance of AI features in the differential diagnosis of PTs and FAs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 40 PTs and 290 FAs <5 cm in maximum diameter found in female patients were retrospectively analyzed. All tumors were segmented by doctors, and the features of the lesions were collated, including circularity, height-to-width ratio, margin spicules, margin coarseness (MC), margin indistinctness, margin lobulation (ML), internal calcification, angle between the long axis of the lesion and skin, energy, grey entropy, and grey mean. The differences between PTs and FAs were analyzed, and the diagnostic performance of AI features in the differential diagnosis of PTs and FAs was evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Statistically significant differences (P<0.05) were found in the height-to-width ratio, ML, energy, and grey entropy between the PTs and FAs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of single features showed that the area under the curve [(AUC) 0.759] of grey entropy was the largest among the four features with statistically significant differences, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were 0.925, 0.459, 0.978, and 0.190, respectively. When considering the combinations of the features, the combination of height-to-width ratio, margin indistinctness, ML, energy, grey entropy, and internal calcification was the most optimal of the combinations of features with an AUC of 0.868, and a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.734, 0.900, 0.982, and 0.316, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Quantitative analysis of AI can identify subtle differences in the morphology and textural features between small PTs and FAs.

Despite approaching expert-level diagnosis performance, convolutional neural network (ConvNet) adoption in clinical practice is impeded by their limited explainability, and by subjective, expensive explainability validations. We introduce DermX, an end-to-end framework for explainable automated dermatological diagnosis. DermX is a clinically-inspired explainable dermatological diagnosis ConvNet, trained using DermXDB, a 554 image dataset annotated by eight dermatologists with diagnoses, supporting explanations, and explanation attention maps. DermX+ extends DermX with guided attention training for explanation attention maps. Both methods achieve near-expert diagnosis performance, with DermX, DermX+, and dermatologist F1 scores of 0.79, 0.79, and 0.87, respectively. We assess the explanation performance in terms of identification and localization by comparing model-selected with dermatologist-selected explanations, and gradient-weighted class-activation maps with dermatologist explanation maps, respectively. DermX obtained an identification F1 score of 0.77, while DermX+ obtained 0.79. The localization F1 score is 0.39 for DermX and 0.35 for DermX+. These results show that explainability does not necessarily come at the expense of predictive power, as our high-performance models provide expert-inspired explanations for their diagnoses without lowering their diagnosis performance."

            "abstract": "Research has shown that the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of equine sarcoids (ES) can be improved. Particularly, less experienced veterinarians are often mistaken in their clinical judgement despite a high level of diagnostic confidence. The aim of this study was to develop and assess the performance of a diagnostic protocol (DP) to improve diagnostic accuracy and identify diagnostically challenging cases. The design of the DP was based on typical clinical features of ES and its algorithm was optimised through repeated tests on clinical cases prior to validating its performance in a representative online examination. A total of 22 equine practitioners and 31 veterinary students used the DP to diagnose 40 standardised ES and non-ES cases in an online examination. Scores of these 53 respondents were compared to scores of 128 respondents of comparable levels of expertise, and 14 experts, all assessing the same cases without using the DP. Overall, respondents using the DP were significantly more likely (odds ratio (OR) 1.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.09-1.43) to diagnose a case correctly compared to respondents not using the DP and felt significantly more confident of their diagnosis (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.39-1.67). Thus, the DP proved to be a reliable tool to increase clinical diagnostic accuracy and diagnostic confidence. The DP algorithms may be further improved with experiences gained from its application in equine practice and clinicians will be able to optimise their diagnostic accuracy and selection of lesions requiring a biopsy."

This cross-sectional study analyzes the dermoscopy workshop intervention of a dermoscopy multimodal curriculum. Volunteers attended one 120-minute dermoscopy workshop on benign and malignant growths using a validated algorithm. Participants took a 30-image pre- and posttest. Survey questions on dermoscopy use, preferences for learning, and skin biopsy performance were included to enhance curriculum development. About 96 participants completed both pre- and postintervention tests. The mean preintervention score (out of 30) was 18.6 and increased to 24.4 on the postintervention evaluation. There was a statistically significant improvement in scores for both benign and malignant skin growths after the intervention (P < .05). Short dermoscopy workshops have a positive intervention effect when training primary care providers to identify images of benign and malignant dermoscopic skin lesions. A multimodal dermoscopy curriculum allows learners to build on initial training using spaced review and blended learning strategies.

Dermatologists usually diagnose melanoma by visual inspection of moles. Digital hair removal can provide a non-invasive way to remove hair and hair-like regions as a pre-processing step for skin lesion images. Hair removal has two main steps: hair segmentation and hair gaps inpainting. However, hair segmentation is a challenging task which requires manual tuning of thresholding parameters. Hard-coded threshold leads to over-segmentation (false positives) which in return changes the textural integrity of lesions and or under-segmentation (false negatives) which leaves hair traces and artefacts which affect subsequent diagnosis. Additionally, dermal hair exhibits different characteristics: thin; overlapping; faded; occluded and overlaid on textured lesions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this presented paper, we proposed a deep learning approach based on a hybrid network of convolutional and recurrent layers for hair segmentation using weakly labelled data. We utilised the deep encoded features for accurate detection and delineation of hair in skin images. The encoded features are then fed into recurrent neural network layers to encode the spatial dependencies between disjointed patches. Experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset, called \"Towards Melanoma Detection: Challenge\". We chose two metrics to evaluate the produced segmentation masks. The first metric is the Jaccard Index which penalises false positives and false negatives.

            "abstract": "Purpose: Current skin cancer detection relies on dermatologists' visual assessments of moles directly or dermoscopically. Our goal is to show that our similarity assessment algorithm on dermoscopic images can perform as well as a dermatologist's assessment. Approach: Given one target mole and two other moles from the same patient, our model determines which mole is more similar to the target mole. Similarity was quantified as the Euclidean distance in a feature space designed to capture mole properties such as size, shape, and color. We tested our model on 18 patients, each of whom had at least five moles, and compared the model assessments of mole similarity with that of three dermatologists. Fleiss' Kappa agreement coefficients and iteration tests were used to evaluate the agreement in similarity assessment among dermatologists and our model. Results: With the selected features of size, entropy (color variation), and cluster prominence (asymmetry), our algorithm's similarity assessments agreed moderately with the similarity assessments of dermatologists. The mean Kappa of 1000 iteration tests was 0.49 ( confidence interval   ( CI ) = [ 0.23 , 0.74 ]  ) when comparing three dermatologists and our model, which is comparable to the agreement in similarity assessment among the dermatologists themselves (the mean Kappa of 1000 iteration tests for three dermatologists was 0.48, CI = [ 0.19 , 0.77 ]  .) By contrast, the mean Kappa was 0.22 ( CI = [ - 0.00 , 0.43 ]  ) when comparing the similarity assessments of three dermatologists and random guesses. Conclusions: Our study showed that our image feature-engineering-based algorithm can effectively assess the similarity of moles as dermatologists do. Such a similarity assessment could serve as the foundation for computer-assisted intra-patient evaluation of moles."

The detection of melanoma in its early stage is essential for prognosis improvement and for guaranteeing a high five-year relative survival rate of patients. The clinical diagnosis of skin lesions is challenging and not trivial since it depends on human vision and physician experience and expertise. Therefore, a computer method that makes an accurate extraction of important details of skin lesion image can assist dermatologists in cancer detection. In particular, the border detection is a critical computer vision issue owing to the wide range of lesion shapes, sizes, colours and skin texture types. In this paper, an automatic and effective pigmented skin lesion segmentation method in dermoscopic image is presented. The proposed procedure is adopted to extract a mask of the lesion region without the adoption of other signal processing procedures for image improvement.

Also, skin lesion images are largely similar in overall appearance owing to the low inter-class variability. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework for automatic classification of skin lesion images using adversarial training and transfer learning toward melanoma detection. In the first stage, we leverage the inter-class variation of the data distribution for the task of conditional image synthesis by learning the inter-class mapping and synthesizing under-represented class samples from the over-represented ones using unpaired image-to-image translation. In the second stage, we train a deep convolutional neural network for skin lesion classification using the original training set combined with the newly synthesized under-represented class samples. The training of this classifier is carried out by minimizing the focal loss function, which assists the model in learning from hard examples, while down-weighting the easy ones. Experiments conducted on a dermatology image benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over several standard baseline methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Interestingly, we show through feature visualization and analysis that our method leads to context based lesion assessment that can reach an expert dermatologist level."

We, therefore, aimed to find disease-specific immune profiles, discriminating Pso from PsA patients, possibly facilitating the correct identification of Pso patients in need of referral to a rheumatology clinic. The phenotypes of peripheral blood immune cells of consecutive Pso and PsA patients were analyzed, and disease-specific immune profiles were identified via a machine learning approach. This approach resulted in a random forest classification model capable of distinguishing PsA from Pso (mean AUC = 0.95).

In order to achieve more effective and accurate segmentation of skin lesions, a parallel network architecture based on Transformer is proposed in this paper. This network is composed of two parallel branches: the former is the newly constructed multiple residual frequency channel attention network (MFC), and the latter is the visual transformer network (ViT). First, in the MFC network branch, the multiple residual module and the frequency channel attention module (FCA) module are fused to improve the robustness of the network and enhance the capability of extracting image detailed features. Second, in the ViT network branch, multiple head self-attention (MSA) in Transformer is used to preserve the global features of the image. Finally, the feature information extracted from the two branches are combined in parallel to realize image segmentation more effectively. To verify the proposed algorithm, we conducted experiments on the dermoscopy image dataset published by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) in 2018. The results show that the intersection-over-union (IoU) and Dice coefficients of the proposed algorithm achieve 90.15% and 94.82%, respectively, which are better than the latest skin melanoma segmentation networks.

            "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic-relapsing inflammatory skin disease, burdened by various comorbidities. AD most commonly occurs in children but may persist or present in adulthood becoming a lifelong condition. Therefore, AD requires an effective long-term treatment improving disease signs and symptoms but also of patients' quality of life (QoL). However continuous long-term use of most traditional AD immunosuppressive treatments is not recommended for safety reasons or insufficient efficacy data. Despite the available guidelines, there is still need for knowledge of AD long-term treatment, taking into account new disease measures and recent treatment options. Five Italian scientific societies implemented a joint consensus procedure to define the most appropriate clinical practice for the long-term management of adult moderate-severe AD. Through a modified Delphi procedure, consensus was reached by overall 51 Italian dermatologists and allergists (The Italian AD Study Group) experienced in the management of adult AD on 14 statements covering three AD areas of interest, namely diagnosis, definition of disease severity and clinimetrics, and a treat-to-target approach. This paper reports and discusses the agreed statements, which define disease and patient impact measures, therapeutic approach, and a treatment decision algorithm to support clinicians in the long-term management of adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD in their daily clinical practice."

However, patients' responses to the involvement of AI in the care process remains largely unclear. The study aims to explore whether individuals were more likely to follow a recommendation when a physician used AI in the diagnostic process considering a highly (vs. less) severe disease compared to when the physician did not use AI or when AI fully replaced the physician.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants from the USA (n = 452) were randomly assigned to a hypothetical scenario where they imagined that they received a treatment recommendation after a skin cancer diagnosis (high vs. low severity) from a physician, a physician using AI, or an automated AI tool. They then indicated their intention to follow the recommendation. Regression analyses were used to test hypotheses. Beta coefficients (ß) describe the nature and strength of relationships between predictors and outcome variables; confidence intervals [CI] excluding zero indicate significant mediation effects.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The total effects reveal the inferiority of automated AI (ß = .47, p = .001 vs. physician; ß = .49, p = .001 vs. physician using AI). Two pathways increase intention to follow the recommendation. When a physician performs the assessment (vs. automated AI), the perception that the physician is real and present (a concept called social presence) is high, which increases intention to follow the recommendation (ß = .22, 95% CI [.09; 0.39]). When AI performs the assessment (vs. physician only), perceived innovativeness of the method is high, which increases intention to follow the recommendation (ß = .15, 95% CI [- .28; - .04]). When physicians use AI, social presence does not decrease and perceived innovativeness increases.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Pairing AI with a physician in medical diagnosis and treatment in a hypothetical scenario using topical therapy and oral medication as treatment recommendations leads to a higher intention to follow the recommendation than AI on its own. The findings might help develop practice guidelines for cases where AI involvement benefits outweigh risks, such as using AI in pathology and radiology, to enable augmented human intelligence and inform physicians about diagnoses and treatments."

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that deep learning is capable of classifying dermatoscopic images at least as well as dermatologists. However, many studies in skin cancer classification utilize non-biopsy-verified training images. This imperfect ground truth introduces a systematic error, but the effects on classifier performance are currently unknown. Here, we systematically examine the effects of label noise by training and evaluating convolutional neural networks (CNN) with 804 images of melanoma and nevi labeled either by dermatologists or by biopsy. The CNNs are evaluated on a test set of 384 images by means of 4-fold cross validation comparing the outputs with either the corresponding dermatological or the biopsy-verified diagnosis. With identical ground truths of training and test labels, high accuracies with 75.03% (95% CI: 74.39-75.66%) for dermatological and 73.80% (95% CI: 73.10-74.51%) for biopsy-verified labels can be achieved. However, if the CNN is trained and tested with different ground truths, accuracy drops significantly to 64.53% (95% CI: 63.12-65.94%, p < 0.01) on a non-biopsy-verified and to 64.24% (95% CI: 62.66-65.83%, p < 0.01) on a biopsy-verified test set. In conclusion, deep learning methods for skin cancer classification are highly sensitive to label noise and future work should use biopsy-verified training images to mitigate this problem."

To ensure treatment safety, research efforts are needed to comprehensively detect and understand irAEs. Retrospective analysis of data from electronic health records can provide knowledge to characterize these toxicities. However, such information is not captured in a structured format within the electronic health record and requires manual chart review.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      In this work, we propose a natural language processing pipeline that can automatically annotate clinical notes and determine whether there is evidence that a patient developed an irAE. Seven hundred eighty-one cases were manually reviewed by clinicians and annotated for irAEs at the patient level. A dictionary of irAEs keywords was used to perform text reduction on clinical notes belonging to each patient; only sentences with relevant expressions were kept. Word embeddings were then used to generate vector representations over the reduced text, which served as input for the machine learning classifiers. The output of the models was presence or absence of any irAEs. Additional models were built to classify skin-related toxicities, endocrine toxicities, and colitis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The model for any irAE achieved an average F1-score = 0.75 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.85.

Timely recognition of the erythema migrans rash of acute Lyme disease by patients and clinicians is crucial to early diagnosis and treatment. Our objective in this study was to develop deep learning approaches using deep convolutional neural networks for detecting acute Lyme disease from erythema migrans images of varying quality and acquisition conditions. This study used a cross-sectional dataset of images to train a model employing a deep convolutional neural network to perform classification of erythema migrans versus other skin conditions including tinea corporis and herpes zoster, and normal, non-pathogenic skin. Evaluation of the machine's ability to classify skin types was also performed on a validation set of images. Machine performance for detecting erythema migrans was further tested against a panel of non-medical humans. Online, publicly available images of both erythema migrans and non-Lyme confounding skin lesions were mined, and combined with erythema migrans images from an ongoing, longitudinal study of participants with acute Lyme disease enrolled in 2016 and 2017 who were recruited from primary and urgent care centers. The final dataset had 1834 images, including 1718 expert clinician-curated online images from unknown individuals with erythema migrans, tinea corporis, herpes zoster, and normal skin. It also included 116 images taken of 63 research participants from the Mid-Atlantic region. Two clinicians carefully annotated all lesion images. A convenience sample of 7 non-medically-trained humans were used as a panel to compare against machine performance. We calculated several performance metrics, including accuracy and Kappa (characterizing agreement with gold standard), as well as a receiver operating characteristic curve and associated area under the curve. For detecting erythema migrans, the machine had an accuracy (95% confidence interval error margin) of 86.53% (2.70), ROCAUC of 0.9510 (0.0171) and Kappa of 0.7143. Our results suggested substantial agreement between machine and clinician criterion standard. Comparison of machine with non-medical expert human performance indicated that the machine almost always exceeded acceptable specificity, and could operate with higher sensitivity. This could have benefits for prescreening prior to physician referral, earlier treatment, and reductions in morbidity."

The DNN was trained using 12 254 images from the ISIC set and 594 images from the Shinshu set. The sensitivity for malignancy prediction by the dermatologists was significantly higher for the Shinshu set than for the ISIC set (0.853 [95% confidence interval, 0.820-0.885] vs 0.608 [0.553-0.664], P < 0.001). The specificity of the DNN at the dermatologists' mean sensitivity value was 0.962 for the Shinshu set and 1.00 for the ISIC set and significantly higher than that for the human readers (both P < 0.001). The dermoscopic diagnostic performance of dermatologists for skin tumors tended to be less accurate for patients of non-local populations, particularly in relation to the dominant skin type. A DNN may help close this gap in the clinical setting."

Although commonly used eXplainable AI (XAI) methods provide insights into these largely opaque algorithms, such explanations are usually convoluted and not readily comprehensible. The explanation of decisions regarding the malignancy of skin lesions from dermoscopic images demands particular clarity, as the underlying medical problem definition is ambiguous in itself. This work presents ExAID (Explainable AI for Dermatology), a novel XAI framework for biomedical image analysis that provides multi-modal concept-based explanations, consisting of easy-to-understand textual explanations and visual maps, to justify the predictions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Our framework relies on Concept Activation Vectors to map human-understandable concepts to those learned by an arbitrary Deep Learning (DL) based algorithm, and Concept Localisation Maps to highlight those concepts in the input space.

The combination of the high sensitivity and specificity from 18F-FDG PET and the high resolution from CT makes accurate assessment of disease status and treatment response possible. Since cancer is a systemic disease, whole-body imaging is of high interest. Moreover, whole-body metabolic tumour burden is emerging as a promising new biomarker predicting outcome for innovative immunotherapy in different tumour types.

Presence and distribution of lesional vessels are associated with specific abnormalities. Therefore, detection and localization of cutaneous vessels provide critical information towards diagnosis and stage status of diseases. However, cutaneous vessels are highly variable in shape, size, color and architecture, which complicate the detection task. Considering the large variability of these structures, conventional vessel detection techniques lack the generalizability to detect different vessel types and require separate algorithms to be designed for each type. Furthermore, such techniques are highly dependent on precise hand-crafted features which are time-consuming and computationally inefficient. As a solution, we propose a data-driven feature learning framework based on stacked sparse auto-encoders (SSAE) for comprehensive detection of cutaneous vessels. Each training image is divided into small patches of either containing or non-containing vasculature. A multilayer SSAE is designed to learn hidden features of the data in hierarchical layers in an unsupervised manner. The high-level learned features are subsequently fed into a classifier which categorizes each patch into absence or presence of vasculature and localizes vessels within the lesion. Over a test set of 3095 patches derived from 200 images, the proposed framework demonstrated superior performance of 95.4% detection accuracy over a variety of vessel patterns; outperforming other techniques by achieving the highest positive predictive value of 94.7%.

The model is trained and tested with the sliding window technique. The proposed concatenated X-R50 model is cutting-edge, with a 97.8% prediction accuracy. The performance of the model is also validated by a statistical hypothesis test using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The reported approach is both accurate and efficient and can help dermatologists and clinicians detect skin cancer at an early stage of the clinical process."

However, due to blurred boundaries, low contrast between the lesion and its surrounding skin, and changes in color and shape, most existing segmentation methods still face great challenges in obtaining receptive fields and extracting image feature information. To settle the above issues, we construct a new framework, named SEACU-Net, to analyze and segment skin lesion images.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Inspired by the U-Net, we utilize dense convolution blocks to obtain more discriminative information. Then, at each encoding and decoding stage, a channel and spatial squeeze & excitation layer are designed after each convolution, to adaptively enhance useful information features and suppress low-value ones from different feature channels. In addition, the attention mechanism is integrated into the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) structure, which improves sensitivity and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, this network introduces a novel loss based on binary cross-entropy and Jaccard losses, which can ensure more balanced segmentation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The proposed method is applied to the ISIC 2017 and 2018 publicly image databases, then obtains a better performance in Dice, Jaccard, and Accuracy, with 89.11% and 87.58% Dice value, 80.50% and 78.12% Jaccard value, 95.01%, and 93.60% Accuracy value, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The results of quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method reaches high-performance skin lesion segmentation, and can help radiologists make radiotherapy treatment plans in clinical practice."

Even though dermatologists are trained to recognize patterns of morphology, it is still a subjective visual assessment. Tools for automated pattern recognition can provide objective information to support clinical decision-making. Noninvasive skin imaging techniques provide complementary information to the clinician. In recent years, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become a powerful skin imaging technique. According to specific functional needs, skin architecture varies across different parts of the body, as do the textural characteristics in OCT images. There is, therefore, a critical need to systematically analyze OCT images from different body sites, to identify their significant qualitative and quantitative differences. Sixty-three optical and textural features extracted from OCT images of healthy and diseased skin are analyzed and, in conjunction with decision-theoretic approaches, used to create computational models of the diseases. We demonstrate that these models provide objective information to the clinician to assist in the diagnosis of abnormalities of cutaneous microstructure, and hence, aid in the determination of treatment. Specifically, we demonstrate the performance of this methodology on differentiating basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from healthy tissue."

In particular, we use clinical and dermoscopic images of skin lesions along with patient metadata from the Interactive Atlas of Dermoscopy dataset (1011 cases; 20 disease labels; 3 management decisions) and demonstrate that predicting management labels directly is more accurate than predicting the diagnosis and then inferring the management decision ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] improvement in overall accuracy and AUROC respectively), statistically significant at [Formula: see text]. Directly predicting management decisions also considerably reduces the over-excision rate as compared to management decisions inferred from diagnosis predictions (24.56% fewer cases wrongly predicted to be excised).

Herein, we summarized the relevant evidence and provided an algorithm for decision-making in MCC management based on the latest 2021 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Additionally, we report current active MCC clinical trials in the United States. The initial management of MCC is dependent upon the pathology of the primary tumor and presence of metastatic disease. Patients with no clinical evidence of regional lymph node involvement generally require sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) while clinically node-positive patients should undergo fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy and full imaging workup. If SLNB or FNA/core biopsy are positive, a multidisciplinary team should be assembled to discuss if additional node dissection or adjuvant therapy is necessary. Wide local excision is optimal for primary tumor management and SLNB remains the preferred staging and predictive tool in MCC.

Therefore, it is classified as a serious disease that directly threatens human health and life. Recently, the number of deaths due to this disease has increased significantly. Thus, researchers are interested in creating computer-aided diagnostic systems that aid in the proper diagnosis and detection of these lesions from dermoscopy images. Relying on manual diagnosis is time consuming in addition to requiring enough experience from dermatologists. Current skin lesion segmentation systems use deep convolutional neural networks to detect skin lesions from RGB dermoscopy images. However, relying on RGB color model is not always the optimal choice to train such networks because some fine details of lesion parts in the dermoscopy images can not clearly appear using RGB color model. Other color models exhibit invariant features of the dermoscopy images so that they can improve the performance of deep neural networks. In the proposed Color Invariant U-Net (CIU-Net) model, a color mixture block is added at the beginning of the contracting path of U-Net. The color mixture block acts as a mixer to learn the fusion of various input color models and create a new one with three channels. Furthermore, a new channel-attention module is included in the connection path between encoder and decoder paths. This channel attention module is developed to enrich the extracted color features. From the experimental result, we found that the proposed CIU-Net works in harmony with the new proposed hybrid loss function to enhance skin segmentation results.

Given the current decline in BU incidence, clinical expertise in the recognition of BU is likely to wane and laboratory confirmation of BU becomes increasingly important.

The convolutional neural network (Microsoft ResNet-152 model; Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China) was fine-tuned with images from the training portion of the Asan dataset, MED-NODE dataset, and atlas site images (19,398 images in total). The trained model was validated with the testing portion of the Asan, Hallym and Edinburgh datasets. With the Asan dataset, the area under the curve for the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, intraepithelial carcinoma, and melanoma was 0.96 ± 0.01, 0.83 ± 0.01, 0.82 ± 0.02, and 0.96 ± 0.00, respectively.

With the Hallym dataset, the sensitivity for basal cell carcinoma diagnosis was 87.1% ± 6.0%. The tested algorithm performance with 480 Asan and Edinburgh images was comparable to that of 16 dermatologists. To improve the performance of convolutional neural network, additional images with a broader range of ages and ethnicities should be collected."

            "abstract": "An automated melanocytic lesion image-analysis algorithm is described that aims to reproduce the decision-making of a dermatologist. The utility of the algorithm lies in its ability to identify lesions requiring excision from lesions not requiring excision. Using only wavelet coefficients as features, and testing three different machine learning algorithms, a cohort of 250 images of pigmented lesions is classified based on expert dermatologists' recommendations of either excision (165 images) or no excision (85 images). It is shown that the best algorithm utilises the Shannon4 wavelet coupled to the support vector machine, where the latter is used as the classifier. In this case the algorithm, utilising only 22 othogonal features, achieves a 10-fold cross validation sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 and 0.87, resulting in a diagnostic-odds ratio of 261. The advantages of this method over diagnostic algorithms-which make a melanoma/no melanoma decision-are twofold: first, by reproducing the decision-making of a dermatologist, the average number of lesions excised per melanoma among practioners in general can be reduced without compromising the detection of melanoma; and second, the intractable problem of clinically differentiating between many atypical dysplastic naevi and melanoma is avoided. Since many atypical naevi that require excision on clinical grounds will not be melanoma, the algorithm-in contrast to diagnostic algorithms-can aim for perfect specificities without clinical concerns, thus lowering the excision rate of non-melanoma. Finally, the algorithm has been implemented as a smart phone application to investigate its utility in clinical practice and to streamline the assimilation of hitherto unseen tested images into the training set."

However, determining a reliable and clinically applicable cut-off of the acquisition time plays an important role in routine practice. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic equivalence of short acquisition time of 57 with routine 75 seconds per bed position (s/BP) of [18F]-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) PET. Phantom studies applying EARL criteria suggested the feasibility of shortened acquisition time in routine clinical imaging by 3D TOF PET/CT scanners. Ninety-six patients with melanoma, lung or head and neck cancer underwent a standard whole-body, skull base-to-thigh or vertex-to-thigh [18F]-FDG PET/CT examination using the 3D TOF Ingenuity TF PET/CT system (Philips, Cleveland, OH). The [18F]-FDG activity applied was equal to 4MBq per kg body weight. Retrospectively, PET list-mode data were used to calculate a second PET study per patient with a reduced acquisition time of 57 s instead of routine 75 s/BP. PET/CT data were reconstructed using a 3D OSEM TOF algorithm. Blinded patient data were analysed by two nuclear medicine physicians. The number of [18F]-FDG-avid lesions per body region (head&neck, thorax, abdomen, bone, extremity) and image quality (grade 1-5) were evaluated. Semiquantitative analyses were performed by standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements using 3D volume of interests (VOI). The visual and semiquantitative diagnostic equivalence of 214 [18F]-FDG-avid lesions were analysed in the routine standard (75 s/BP) as well as the calculated PET/CT studies with short acquisition time.

Early detection and treatment can improve survival. Smartphone applications are readily accessible and potentially offer an instant risk assessment of the likelihood of malignancy so that the right people seek further medical attention from a clinician for more detailed assessment of the lesion.

Both studies were at high risk of bias from selective participant recruitment and high rates of non-evaluable images. Concerns about applicability of findings were high due to inclusion only of lesions already selected for excision in a dermatology clinic setting, and image acquisition by clinicians rather than by smartphone app users.We report data for five mobile phone applications and 332 suspicious skin lesions with 86 melanomas across the two studies. Across the four artificial intelligence-based applications that classified lesion images (photographs) as melanomas (one application) or as high risk or 'problematic' lesions (three applications) using a pre-programmed algorithm, sensitivities ranged from 7% (95% CI 2% to 16%) to 73% (95% CI 52% to 88%) and specificities from 37% (95% CI 29% to 46%) to 94% (95% CI 87% to 97%). The single application using store-and-forward review of lesion images by a dermatologist had a sensitivity of 98% (95% CI 90% to 100%) and specificity of 30% (95% CI 22% to 40%).The number of test failures (lesion images analysed by the applications but classed as 'unevaluable' and excluded by the study authors) ranged from 3 to 31 (or 2% to 18% of lesions analysed).

Applications based on store-and-forward images could have a potential role in the timely presentation of people with potentially malignant lesions by facilitating active self-management health practices and early engagement of those with suspicious skin lesions; however, they may incur a significant increase in resource and workload. Given the paucity of evidence and low methodological quality of existing studies, it is not possible to draw any implications for practice.

The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.94, 0.95, and 0.94 for EVCM-, H&E-, and combination-trained models, respectively. We developed an algorithm for automatic BCC detection in EVCM images (comparable accuracy to dermatologists). This approach could be used to assist with BCC detection during Mohs surgery.

In general, cancer is nothing but the unnatural growth of blood cells in different parts of the body and is named accordingly. It may be skin cancer, breast cancer, uterus cancer, intestinal cancer, stomach cancer, etc. However, every type of cancer consists of unwanted blood cells which cause issues in the body starting from the minor to death. Cancer cells have the common features in them, and these common features we have used in our work for the processing. Cancer has a significant death rate; however, it is frequently curable with simple surgery if detected in its early stages. A quick and correct diagnosis may be extremely beneficial to both doctors and patients. In several medical domains, the latest deep-learning-based model's performance is comparable to or even exceeds that of human specialists. We have proposed a novel methodology based on a convolutional neural network that may be used for almost all types of cancer detection. We have collected different datasets of different types of common cancer from different sources and used 90% of the sample data for the training purpose, then we reduced it by 10%, and an 80% image set was used for the validation of the model.

Statistics show that competent dermatologists have a diagnostic accuracy rate of less than 80%, while inexperienced dermatologists have a diagnostic accuracy rate of less than 60%. The higher rate of misdiagnosis will cause many patients to miss the most effective treatment window, risking the patients' life safety. However, the majority of the current study of neural network-based skin cancer diagnosis remains at the image level without patient clinical data. A deep convolutional network incorporating clinical patient metadata of skin cancer is presented to realize the classification model of skin cancer in order to further increase the accuracy of skin cancer diagnosis. There are three basic steps in the approach. First, the high-level features (edge features, color features, texture features, form features, etc.). Implied by the image were retrieved using the pre-trained DenseNet-169 model on the ImageNet dataset. Second, the MetaNet module is introduced, which uses metadata to control a certain portion of each feature channel in the DenseNet-169 network in order to produce weighted features. The MetaBlock module was added at the same time to improve the features retrieved from photos using metadata, choosing the most pertinent characteristics in accordance with the metadata data. The features of the MetaNet and MetaBlock modules were finally combined to create the MD-Net module, which was then used as input into the classifier to get the classification results for skin cancers. On the PAD-UFES-20 and ISIC 2019 datasets, the suggested methodology was assessed. The DenseNet-169 network model combined with this module, according to experimental data, obtains 81.4% in the balancing accuracy index, and its diagnostic accuracy is up between 8% and 15.6% compared to earlier efforts.

Given the high complexity of this task, we propose a new prioritization pipeline guided and inspired by domain knowledge. We explored automatic lesion segmentation and tested different learning schemes, namely hierarchical classification and curriculum learning approaches, optionally including additional patient metadata. The final priority level prediction can then be obtained by combining predicted diagnosis and a baseline priority level accounting for explicit expert knowledge. In both the differential diagnosis and prioritization branches, lesion segmentation with 30% tolerance for contextual information was shown to improve classification when compared with a flat baseline model trained on original images; furthermore, the addition of patient information was not beneficial for most experiments. Curriculum learning delivered better results than a flat or hierarchical approach.

Three patients were initially diagnosed and treated in neighbouring Counties Manukau District Health Board and later transferred to Auckland District Health Board. All had different initial treating clinicians at a time before any predefined treatment algorithm. Emphasis was placed on initial diagnosis and treatment, subsequent disease activity and changes in management. Local management was compared retrospectively with existing evidence relating to the treatment of anti-MDA-5 DM with ILD. Ethical approval was not obtained, according to the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee exemption for audits and related activities.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Six patients with a variety of clinical presentations were identified appropriately as having anti-MDA-5 DM with ILD. They were commenced on different immunosuppressive regimens, with treatment adjusted according to response and on-going disease activity.

This can be rapidly progressive, with a poor prognosis in spite of treatment, particularly among Asian patients. Disease activity can seemingly be monitored with serum ferritin. The most effective management of this condition remains poorly researched; however, increasing retrospective evidence favours early aggressive multi-agent immunosuppression and a low threshold for escalation of therapy."

To evaluate changes in erythema, a reliable device that can support objective diagnosis is required.

To assess the performance in comparison to dermatologists' evaluations, five dermatologists independently evaluate the areas of erythema, and we defined an area called the clinical consensus area of erythema (CCAE), which is based on the majority opinion of dermatologists during evaluation. The CCAE values obtained were compared with the erythema areas determined by the system's diagnostic algorithm.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Forty-one photographs with areas of erythema were evaluated by the proposed system and by dermatologists.

The results also showed that the proposed system could detect erythema areas without any pigmentation. In contrast to assessments by individual dermatologists, use of the CCAE reduced the amount of error that occurred owing to bias or subjectivity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      A new erythema evaluation system was developed and validated through CCAE, suggesting that the system can support dermatologists' objective diagnoses of erythema."

We aimed to simulate these real-world scenarios and evaluate the effects of image source institution, diagnoses outside of the training set, and other image artifacts on classification accuracy, with the goal of informing clinicians and regulatory agencies about safety and real-world accuracy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We designed a large dermoscopic image classification challenge to quantify the performance of machine learning algorithms for the task of skin cancer classification from dermoscopic images, and how this performance is affected by shifts in statistical distributions of data, disease categories not represented in training datasets, and imaging or lesion artifacts. Factors that might be beneficial to performance, such as clinical metadata and external training data collected by challenge participants, were also evaluated. 25 331 training images collected from two datasets (in Vienna [HAM10000] and Barcelona [BCN20000]) between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2018, across eight skin diseases, were provided to challenge participants to design appropriate algorithms. The trained algorithms were then tested for balanced accuracy against the HAM10000 and BCN20000 test datasets and data from countries not included in the training dataset (Turkey, New Zealand, Sweden, and Argentina). Test datasets contained images of all diagnostic categories available in training plus other diagnoses not included in training data (not trained category).

Shifted statistical distributions and disease categories not included in training data contributed to decreases in accuracy. Image artifacts, including hair, pen markings, ulceration, and imaging source institution, decreased accuracy in a complex manner that varied based on the underlying diagnosis. When comparing algorithms to expert dermatologists (2460 ratings on 1269 images), algorithms performed better than experts in most categories, except for actinic keratoses (similar accuracy on average) and images from categories not included in training data (26% correct for experts vs 6% correct for algorithms, p<0·0001).

Early detection classically involves dermoscopy to identify suspicious lesions for which biopsy is indicated. Biopsy and histological examination then diagnose benign nevi, atypical nevi, or cancerous growths. With current methods, a considerable number of unnecessary biopsies are performed as only 11% of all biopsied, suspicious lesions are actually melanomas. Thus, there is a need for more advanced noninvasive diagnostics to guide the decision of whether or not to biopsy. Artificial intelligence can generate screening algorithms that transform a set of imaging biomarkers into a risk score that can be used to classify a lesion as a melanoma or a nevus by comparing the score to a classification threshold. Melanoma imaging biomarkers have been shown to be spectrally dependent in Red, Green, Blue (RGB) color channels, and hyperspectral imaging may further enhance diagnostic power.

The overall survival rate for early-stage disease is 99.4%. However, melanoma can recur years later (in the same region of the body or as distant metastasis), and results in a dramatically lower survival rate. Currently there is no reliable method to predict tumor recurrence and metastasis on early primary tumor histological images.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      To identify rapid, accurate, and cost-effective predictors of metastasis and survival, in this work, we applied various interpretable machine learning approaches to analyze melanoma histopathological H&E images. The result is a set of image features that can help clinicians identify high-risk-of-metastasis patients for increased clinical follow-up and precision treatment. We use simple models (i.e., logarithmic classification and KNN) and \"human-interpretable\" measures of cell morphology and tissue architecture (e.g., cell size, staining intensity, and cell density) to predict the melanoma survival on public and local Stage I-III cohorts as well as the metastasis risk on a local cohort.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We use penalized survival regression to limit features available to downstream classifiers and investigate the utility of convolutional neural networks in isolating tumor regions to focus morphology extraction on only the tumor region.

We find that good quality AI-based support of clinical decision-making improves diagnostic accuracy over that of either AI or physicians alone, and that the least experienced clinicians gain the most from AI-based support. We further find that AI-based multiclass probabilities outperformed content-based image retrieval (CBIR) representations of AI in the mobile technology environment, and AI-based support had utility in simulations of second opinions and of telemedicine triage. In addition to demonstrating the potential benefits associated with good quality AI in the hands of non-expert clinicians, we find that faulty AI can mislead the entire spectrum of clinicians, including experts. Lastly, we show that insights derived from AI class-activation maps can inform improvements in human diagnosis.

We separated studies according to whether the diagnosis was recorded face-to-face (in-person), or based on remote (image-based), assessment.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Studies of any design that evaluated dermoscopy in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma, compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow-up. Data on the accuracy of visual inspection, to allow comparisons of tests, was included only if reported in the included studies of dermoscopy.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS-2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated accuracy using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC),methods. Analysis of studies allowing direct comparison between tests was undertaken. To facilitate interpretation of results, we computed values of sensitivity at the point on the SROC curve with 80% fixed specificity and values of specificity with 80% fixed sensitivity. We investigated the impact of in-person test interpretation; use of a purposely developed algorithm to assist diagnosis; observer expertise; and dermoscopy training.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included a total of 104 study publications reporting on 103 study cohorts with 42,788 lesions (including 5700 cases), providing 354 datasets for dermoscopy. The risk of bias was mainly low for the index test and reference standard domains and mainly high or unclear for participant selection and participant flow. Concerns regarding the applicability of study findings were largely scored as 'high' concern in three of four domains assessed. Selective participant recruitment, lack of reproducibility of diagnostic thresholds and lack of detail on observer expertise were particularly problematic.The accuracy of dermoscopy for the detection of invasive melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants was reported in 86 datasets; 26 for evaluations conducted in person (dermoscopy added to visual inspection), and 60 for image-based evaluations (diagnosis based on interpretation of dermoscopic images). Analyses of studies by prior testing revealed no obvious effect on accuracy; analyses were hampered by the lack of studies in primary care, lack of relevant information and the restricted inclusion of lesions selected for biopsy or excision. Accuracy was higher for in-person diagnosis compared to image-based evaluations (relative diagnostic odds ratio (RDOR) 4.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.4 to 9.0; P < 0.001).We compared accuracy for (a), in-person evaluations of dermoscopy (26 evaluations; 23,169 lesions and 1664 melanomas),versus visual inspection alone (13 evaluations; 6740 lesions and 459 melanomas), and for (b), image-based evaluations of dermoscopy (60 evaluations; 13,475 lesions and 2851 melanomas),versus image-based visual inspection (11 evaluations; 1740 lesions and 305 melanomas). For both comparisons, meta-analysis found dermoscopy to be more accurate than visual inspection alone, with RDORs of (a), 4.7 (95% CI 3.0 to 7.5; P < 0.001), and (b), 5.6 (95% CI 3.7 to 8.5; P < 0.001). For a), the predicted difference in sensitivity at a fixed specificity of 80% was 16% (95% CI 8% to 23%; 92% for dermoscopy + visual inspection versus 76% for visual inspection), and predicted difference in specificity at a fixed sensitivity of 80% was 20% (95% CI 7% to 33%; 95% for dermoscopy + visual inspection versus 75% for visual inspection). For b) the predicted differences in sensitivity was 34% (95% CI 24% to 46%; 81% for dermoscopy versus 47% for visual inspection), at a fixed specificity of 80%, and predicted difference in specificity was 40% (95% CI 27% to 57%; 82% for dermoscopy versus 42% for visual inspection), at a fixed sensitivity of 80%.Using the median prevalence of disease in each set of studies ((a), 12% for in-person and (b), 24% for image-based), for a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions, an increase in sensitivity of (a), 16% (in-person), and (b), 34% (image-based), from using dermoscopy at a fixed specificity of 80% equates to a reduction in the number of melanomas missed of (a), 19 and (b), 81 with (a), 176 and (b), 152 false positive results. An increase in specificity of (a), 20% (in-person), and (b), 40% (image-based), at a fixed sensitivity of 80% equates to a reduction in the number of unnecessary excisions from using dermoscopy of (a), 176 and (b), 304 with (a), 24 and (b), 48 melanomas missed.The use of a named or published algorithm to assist dermoscopy interpretation (as opposed to no reported algorithm or reported use of pattern analysis), had no significant impact on accuracy either for in-person (RDOR 1.4, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.6; P = 0.17), or image-based (RDOR 1.4, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.3; P = 0.22), evaluations. This result was supported by subgroup analysis according to algorithm used. We observed higher accuracy for observers reported as having high experience and for those classed as 'expert consultants' in comparison to those considered to have less experience in dermoscopy, particularly for image-based evaluations. Evidence for the effect of dermoscopy training on test accuracy was very limited but suggested associated improvements in sensitivity.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Despite the observed limitations in the evidence base, dermoscopy is a valuable tool to support the visual inspection of a suspicious skin lesion for the detection of melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, particularly in referred populations and in the hands of experienced users. Data to support its use in primary care are limited, however, it may assist in triaging suspicious lesions for urgent referral when employed by suitably trained clinicians. Formal algorithms may be of most use for dermoscopy training purposes and for less expert observers, however reliable data comparing approaches using dermoscopy in person are lacking."

Due to a shortage of board-certified dermatologists, the burden of dermal lesion screening and erythema monitoring has fallen to primary care physicians (PCPs).

Although the automatic detection and prediction of diseases such as melanoma and leukemia is still being investigated and studied in IoMT, existing approaches are not able to achieve a high degree of efficiency. Thus, with a new approach that provides better results, patients would access the adequate treatments earlier and the death rate would be reduced. Therefore, this paper introduces an IoMT proposal for medical images' classification that may be used anywhere, i.e., it is an ubiquitous approach. It was designed in two stages: first, we employ a transfer learning (TL)-based method for feature extraction, which is carried out using MobileNetV3; second, we use the chaos game optimization (CGO) for feature selection, with the aim of excluding unnecessary features and improving the performance, which is key in IoMT. Our methodology was evaluated using ISIC-2016, PH2, and Blood-Cell datasets. The experimental results indicated that the proposed approach obtained an accuracy of 88.39% on ISIC-2016, 97.52% on PH2, and 88.79% on Blood-cell datsets. Moreover, our approach had successful performances for the metrics employed compared to other existing methods."

In experimental studies, modern CNN architectures perform single image analysis at the level of dermatologists and domain-experts, also for multiclass predictions including a multitude of possible diagnoses. This may not necessarily translate to good clinical performance, and reliable randomized controlled prospective clinical trials for modern CNNs are essentially missing. Weaknesses of CNNs are that limitations of available training image datasets propagate to limitations of CNN predictions, and they cannot provide a reliable estimate of uncertainty. Recent research focuses on human-computer collaboration, where gains in accuracy were measured even with imperfect CNNs. With missing academic and clinical agreement on equivocal melanocytic lesions, fully automating histologic assessment of them with CNNs appear problematic, and applications in the near future are probably limited to supporting, referencing or recommendation roles."

The deadliest and most serious form of skin cancer is called melanoma. Skin cancer can affect anyone, regardless of skin color, race, gender, and age. The diagnosis of melanoma has been done by visual examination and manual techniques by skilled doctors. It is a time-consuming process and highly prone to error. The skin images captured by dermoscopy eliminate the surface reflection of skin and give a better visualization of deeper levels of the skin. However, the existence of many artifacts and noise such as hair, veins, and water residue make the lesion images very complex. Due to the complexity of images, the border detection, feature extraction, and classification process are challenging. Without a proper mechanism, it is hard to identify and predict melanoma at an early stage. Therefore, there is a need to provide precise details, identify early skin cancer, and classify skin cancer with appropriate sensitivity and precision. This article aims to review and analyze two deep neural network-based classification algorithms (convolutional neural network, CNN; recurrent neural network, RNN) and a decision tree-based algorithm (XG-Boost) on skin lesion images (ISIC dataset) and find which of these provides the best classification performance metric. Also, the performance of algorithms is compared using six different metrics-loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC."

Performance was evaluated using another set of 344 images and 281 images from other hospitals. Classifications by 44 participants (six board-certified dermatologists, 12 dermatology residents, nine medical doctors not specialized in dermatology and 17 medical students) were used for comparison.\n## RESULTS\nThe outcomes based on the area under curve, sensitivity and specificity were 0·827 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0·782-0·873], 0·755 (95% CI 0·673-0·827) and 0·803 (95% CI 0·752-0·855), respectively, for the set of 344 images; and 0·774 (95% CI 0·699-0·849), 0·702 (95% CI 0·579-0·808) and 0·759 (95% CI 0·701-0·813), respectively, for the set of 281 images. The DCNN was equivalent to the dermatologists and superior to the nondermatologists in classifying malignancy. After referencing the DCNN result, the mean ± SD Youden index increased significantly for nondermatologists, from 0·201 ± 0·156 to 0·322 ± 0·141 (P < 0·001).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDCNNs can classify lip diseases at a level similar to dermatologists. This will help unskilled physicians discriminate between benign and malignant lip diseases. What's already known about this topic? Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) can classify malignant and benign skin diseases at a level equivalent to dermatologists. The lips are a unique feature in terms of histology and morphology. Previous studies of DCNNs have not investigated tumours on specific locations. What does this study add? This study shows that DCNNs can distinguish rare malignant and benign lip disorders at the same rate as dermatologists. DCNNs can help nondermatologists to distinguish malignant lip diseases. What are the clinical implications of this work? DCNNs can distinguish malignant and benign skin diseases even at specific locations such as the lips, as well as board-certified dermatologists. Malignant lip diseases are rare and difficult for less trained doctors to differentiate them from benign lesions. This study shows that in dermatology, DCNN can help improve decision-making processes for rare skin diseases in specific areas of the body.\n"

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronically relapsing skin disease. Although a definitive cure is not available, appropriate treatment can control the disease. The advent of biologic drugs has led to the need for a clear definition of the disease severity and treatment response. A standardized list of outcomes that defines clinician-reported disease severity and patients' reported severity are therefore essential. Solid criteria to define the response to treatment and treatment failure are lacking to date.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This systematic review defines treatment goals in terms of clinician-reported disease severity and patient-reported outcomes, referring to the published moderate-to-severe AD clinical trials. The application of these goals in daily clinical practice will ensure a better selection of available treatment options, thus increasing patient quality of care.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic literature search was performed to identify the treatments goals of randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) on moderate-to-severe adult AD published between January 2000 and October 2020.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 14 studies met the eligibility criteria. The most widely used tools in terms of clinician-reported disease severity were the Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) followed by the Eczema Area Severity Score (EASI) and Investigator Global Assessment (IGA). For disease severity scales as efficacy outcome in RCTs, the greatest standardization and reproducibility was for improvement of at least 50% in EASI score and IGA score reduction of ≥2 grades from baseline. The most widely used tools from the patients' perspective were the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Numeric Rate Scale (NRS)-itch and Patient Oriented Eczema Measure Score (POEM). In terms of patients' reported efficacy outcomes in RCTs, a numerical DLQI, NRS-itch and POEM score improvement of at least 4 points from baseline was reported.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This systematic review highlights the need for collaboration between experts in order to define and optimize treatment outcomes. Despite considerable progress in harmonizing outcome measures, promoted by the foundation of the Harmonizing Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) initiative in 2008, our results demonstrate that this endpoint is still an unmet need. Based on the literature data we propose a minimum treatment goal algorithm for use in daily clinical practice aimed at stimulating a discussion on how the care of AD patients could be further improved."

            "abstract": "Skin cancer, and its less common form melanoma, is a disease affecting a wide variety of people. Since it is usually detected initially by visual inspection, it makes for a good candidate for the application of machine learning. With early detection being key to good outcomes, any method that can enhance the diagnostic accuracy of dermatologists and oncologists is of significant interest. When comparing different existing implementations of machine learning against public datasets and several we seek to create, we attempted to create a more accurate model that can be readily adapted to use in clinical settings. We tested combinations of models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and various layers of data manipulation, such as the application of Gaussian functions and trimming of images to improve accuracy. We also created more traditional data models, including support vector classification, K-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms, and compared them to the CNN-based models we had created. Results had indicated that CNN-based algorithms significantly outperformed other data models we had created. Partial results of this work were presented at the CSET Presentations for Research Month at the Minnesota State University, Mankato."

            "abstract": "Skin cancer is considered to be the most common human malignancy. Around 5 million new cases of skin cancer are recorded in the United States annually. Early identification and evaluation of skin lesions are of great clinical significance, but the disproportionate dermatologist-patient ratio poses a significant problem in most developing nations. Therefore a novel deep architecture, named as SkiNet, is proposed to provide faster screening solution and assistance to newly trained physicians in the process of clinical diagnosis of skin cancer. The main motive behind SkiNet's design and development is to provide a white box solution, addressing a critical problem of trust and interpretability which is crucial for the wider adoption of Computer-aided diagnosis systems by medical practitioners. The proposed SkiNet is a two-stage pipeline wherein the lesion segmentation is followed by the lesion classification. Monte Carlo dropout and test time augmentation techniques have been employed in the proposed method to estimate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. A novel segmentation model named Bayesian MultiResUNet is used to estimate the uncertainty on the predicted segmentation map. Saliency-based methods like XRAI, Grad-CAM and Guided Backprop are explored to provide post-hoc explanations of the deep learning models. The ISIC-2018 dataset is used to perform the experimentation and ablation studies. The results establish the robustness of the proposed model on the traditional benchmarks while addressing the black-box nature of such models to alleviate the skepticism of medical practitioners by incorporating transparency and confidence to the model's prediction."

            "abstract": "Motivation:\n        \n      \n      Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women today. Survival rates in developing countries are around 50%-60% due to late detection. A personalized, accurate risk scoring method can help in targeting the right population for follow-up tests and enables early detection of breast abnormalities. Most of the available risk assessment tools use generic and weakly correlated features like age, weight, height etc. While a personalized risk scoring from screening modalities such as mammography and ultrasound could be helpful, these tests are limited to very few metropolitan hospitals in developing countries due to high capital cost, operational expenses and interpretation expertise needed for a large screening population.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We propose and analyze a new personalized risk framework called Thermalytix Risk Score (TRS) to identify a high-risk target population for regular screening and enable early stage breast cancer detection at scale. This technique uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) over thermal images to automatically generate a breast health risk score. This risk score is mainly derived from two sub-scores namely, vascular score and hotspot score. A hotspot score signifies the abnormality seen from irregular asymmetric heat patterns seen on the skin surface, whereas vascular score predicts the presence of asymmetric vascular activity. These scores are generated using machine learning algorithms over medically interpretable parameters that describes the metabolic activity inside the breast tissue and indicate the presence of a possible malignancy even in asymptomatic women.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The proposed personalized risk score was tested on 769 subjects in four breast cancer screening facilities. The subjects' age ranged from 18 to 82 years with a median of around 45 years. Out of the 769 subjects, 185 subjects were diagnosed with a breast malignancy by an expert radiologist after mammography, ultrasound and/or histopathology. Our personalized AI based risk score achieved an area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) of 0.89 when compared to an age normalized risk score that showed an AUC of 0.68. We also found that if the computed risk score is used to place individuals into four risk groups, the likelihood of malignancy also increases monotonically with the risk grouping level.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The proposed AI based personalized risk score uses breast thermal image patterns for risk computation and compares favorably to other generic risk estimation approaches. The proposed risk framework solution is automated, affordable, non-invasive, non-contact and radiation free and works for a wide age range of women from 18 to 82 years, including young women with dense breasts. The proposed score might be further used to assign subjects into one of the four risk groups and provide guidance on the periodicity of screening needed. In addition, the automatically annotated thermal images localizes the potential abnormal regions and might empower the physician to create a better personalized care."

Facial BCCs most commonly occur on the nose and the management of these lesions is particularly complex, given the functional and complex implications of treatment. Multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings are routinely held to integrate expertise from dermatologists, surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, pathologists and allied health professionals. The aim of this research was to develop a supervised machine-learning algorithm to predict MDT recommendations for nasal BCC to potentially reduce MDT caseload, provide automatic decision support and permit data audit in a health service context.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study population included all consecutive patients who were discussed at skin cancer-specialised MDT (SSMDT) with a diagnosis of nasal BCC between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015.

We suggest that utilising this algorithm gives the MDT more time to consider more complex patients, where multiple factors, including recurrence, financial costs and cosmetic outcome, contribute to the final decision, but cannot be reliably predicted to determine that outcome. This approach has the potential to reduce the burden and improve the efficiency of the specialist skin MDT and, in turn, improve patient care, reduce waiting times and reduce the financial burden.

A retrospective study applying machine learning models to a dataset of 8644 MMS procedures to predict complex wound reconstruction and number of MMS procedure stages. Each procedure record contained preoperative data on patient demographics, estimated clinical tumor size prior to surgery (mean diameter), tumor characteristics and tumor location, and postoperative procedure outcomes included the wound reconstruction technique and the number of MMS stages performed in order to achieve tumor-free margins. For the number of stages complexity classification model, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.79 (good performance), with model accuracy of 77%, sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 77%, positive prediction value (PPV) of 14% and negative prediction value (NPV) of 98%.

Retrospective analysis was performed, and 30 children with lymphangioma from the hospital were recruited as the study subjects. The ultrasound-guided bleomycin interventional therapy was adopted and applied to CT scanning through convolutional neural network (CNN). The CT imaging-related indicators before and after interventional therapy were detected, and feature analysis was performed. In addition, the CNN algorithm was adopted to segment the image of the tumor was clearer and more accurate. At the same time, the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of the CNN algorithm was 0.9, which had a higher degree of agreement. In terms of clinical symptoms, the cured children's lesions disappeared, the skin surface returned to normal color, and the treatment was smooth. In the two cases with effective treatment, the cystic mass at the lesion site was significantly smaller, and the nodules disappeared. CT images before interventional therapy showed that lymphangiomas in children were more common in the neck. The cystic masses at all lesion sites varied in diameter and size, and most of them were similar to round and irregular, with uniform density distribution. The boundary was clear, the cyst was solid, and there were different degrees of compression and spread to the surrounding structure. Most of them were polycystic, and a few of them were single cystic. After interventional treatment, CT images showed that 27 cases of cured children's lymphangioma completely disappeared. Lymphangioma was significantly reduced in two children with effective treatment. Edema around the tumor also decreased significantly. Patients who did not respond to the treatment received interventional treatment again, and the tumors disappeared completely on CT imaging. No recurrence or new occurrence was found in three-month follow-up. The total effective rate of interventional therapy for lymphangioma in children was 96.67%. The CNN algorithm can effectively compare the CT image features before and after interventional treatment for children's lymphangioma. It was suggested that the artificial intelligence algorithm-aided CT imaging examination was helpful to guide physicians in the accurate treatment of children's lymphangioma."

The resulting algorithm is simple and easy to implement in multi-dimensions. Concerning applications, we focus on skin tumor segmentation. The clinical dataset used for the experiments is composed of 12 images with the ground truth given by a dermatologist. Comparisons with the reference methods show that the proposed method is more robust to the choice of the volume initialization. Moreover, thanks to the flexibility introduced by the diffuse interface, the sensitivity increases by 12% if the initialization is inside the lesion, and the Dice index increases by 59%, if the initialization covers the entire lesion.

Computer systems can assist in melanoma detection, but are not widespread in clinical practice. In 2016, an open challenge in classification of dermoscopic images of skin lesions was announced. A training set of 900 images with corresponding class labels and semi-automatic/manual segmentation masks was released for the challenge. An independent test set of 379 images, of which 75 were of melanomas, was used to rank the participants. This article demonstrates the impact of ranking criteria, segmentation method and classifier, and highlights the clinical perspective. We compare five different measures for diagnostic accuracy by analysing the resulting ranking of the computer systems in the challenge. Choice of performance measure had great impact on the ranking. Systems that were ranked among the top three for one measure, dropped to the bottom half when changing performance measure. Nevus Doctor, a computer system previously developed by the authors, was used to participate in the challenge, and investigate the impact of segmentation and classifier. The diagnostic accuracy when using an automatic versus the semi-automatic/manual segmentation is investigated. The unexpected small impact of segmentation method suggests that improvements of the automatic segmentation method w.r.t. resemblance to semi-automatic/manual segmentation will not improve diagnostic accuracy substantially. A small set of similar classification algorithms are used to investigate the impact of classifier on the diagnostic accuracy. The variability in diagnostic accuracy for different classifier algorithms was larger than the variability for segmentation methods, and suggests a focus for future investigations. From a clinical perspective, the misclassification of a melanoma as benign has far greater cost than the misclassification of a benign lesion.

It is a consistency-based method which exploits the unlabeled data by encouraging the prediction consistency of given input under perturbations, and leverages a self-ensembling model to produce high-quality consistency targets for the unlabeled data. Considering that human diagnosis often refers to previous analogous cases to make reliable decisions, we introduce a novel sample relation consistency (SRC) paradigm to effectively exploit unlabeled data by modeling the relationship information among different samples. Superior to existing consistency-based methods which simply enforce consistency of individual predictions, our framework explicitly enforces the consistency of semantic relation among different samples under perturbations, encouraging the model to explore extra semantic information from unlabeled data. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our method on two public benchmark medical image classification datasets, i.e., skin lesion diagnosis with ISIC 2018 challenge and thorax disease classification with ChestX-ray14.

As for image classification, the classifier is constructed on the pretrained deep neural network using transfer learning method. The synthetic images from the proposed skin lesion style-based GANs are finally added to the training set to help train the classifier for better classification performance.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The proposed skin lesion style-based GAN has been evaluated by Inception Score (IS), Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Precision and Recall, and is superior to other compared GAN models in these quantitative evaluation metrics.

The creation of a phenotype currently requires clinical experts and experts in the data to be queried. The new approach presented here demonstrates a computational alternative to the classification of patient cohorts based on automatic weighting of ICD codes. This approach was applied to data from six different clinics within the University of Arkansas for Medical Science (UAMS) health system. The results were compared with phenotype algorithms designed by clinicians and informaticians for asthma and melanoma. Relative to traditional phenotype development, this method shows potential to considerably reduce time requirements and monetary costs with comparable results."

            "abstract": "Traditional approaches to automatic diagnosis of skin lesions consisted of classifiers working on sets of hand-crafted features, some of which modeled lesion aspects of special importance for dermatologists. Recently, the broad adoption of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in most computer vision tasks has brought about a great leap forward in terms of performance. Nevertheless, with this performance leap, the CNN-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have also brought a notable reduction of the useful insights provided by hand-crafted features. This paper presents DermaKNet, a CAD system based on CNNs that incorporates specific subsystems modeling properties of skin lesions that are of special interest to dermatologists aiming to improve the interpretability of its diagnosis. Our results prove that the incorporation of these subsystems not only improves the performance, but also enhances the diagnosis by providing more interpretable outputs."

The underrepresentation of dark skin images makes diagnosing skin pathology in people of color challenging. For conditions such as skin cancer, in which early diagnosis makes a difference between life and death, people of color have worse prognoses and lower survival rates than people with lighter skin tones as a result of delayed or incorrect diagnoses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, such as deep learning, offer a potential solution that can be achieved by diversifying the mostly light-skin image repositories through generating images for darker skin tones. Thus, facilitating the development of inclusive cancer early diagnosis systems that are trained and tested on diverse images that truly represent human skin tones.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      We aim to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence-based skin cancer early detection system for all skin tones using clinical images.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study consists of four phases: (1) Publicly available skin image repositories will be analyzed to quantify the underrepresentation of darker skin tones, (2) Images will be generated for the underrepresented skin tones, (3) Generated images will be extensively evaluated for realism and disease presentation with quantitative image quality assessment as well as qualitative human expert and nonexpert ratings, and (4) The images will be utilized with available light-skin images to develop a robust skin cancer early detection model.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      This study started in September 2020.

The most common technique to observe and diagnosis of such cancer is the use of noninvasive dermoscope lens. Since this approach is based on the expert ocular inference, early stage of melanoma diagnosis is a difficult task for dermatologist. The main purpose of this article is to introduce an efficient algorithm to analyze the dermoscopic images. The proposed algorithm consists of four stages including converting the image color space from the RGB to CIE, adjusting the color space by applying the combined histogram equalization and the Otsu thresholding-based approach, border extraction of the lesion through the local Radon transform, and recognizing the melanoma and nonmelanoma lesions employing the ABCD rule. Simulation results in the designed user-friendly software package environment confirmed that the proposed algorithm has the higher quantities of accuracy, sensitivity, and approximation correlation in comparison with the other state-of-the-art methods. These values are obtained 98.81 (98.92), 94.85 (89.51), and 90.99 (86.06) for melanoma (nonmelanoma) lesions, respectively."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the value of high-resolution ultrasound combined with shear-wave elastography (SWE) in measuring skin thickness in patients with localized scleroderma (LS). Fifty patients with LS diagnosed by pathology in the hospital were selected as the research object, with a total of 96 lesions. Healthy people (50 cases) in the same period were selected as the control group. The skin thickness of the abdomen, chest, and left finger of the two groups was compared. The traditional nonlocal means (NLM) algorithm was improved by changing the Euclidean distance and introducing a cosine function, which was applied to the ultrasonic imaging intelligent diagnosis of patients with localized scleroderma. SWE imaging was evaluated, and the results demonstrated that LS lesion edema stage accounted for 7.29%, hardening stage occupied 43.75%, and the proportion of atrophy stage reached 48.96%. When the size of shell was 1 mm, maximum elastic modulus (E max) was 0.984, mean of elastic modulus (Emean) was 0.926, and electro-static discharge (Esd) was 0.965. When the size of shell was 2 mm, the elastic moduli around lesions were as follows: Emax was 0.998, Emean was 0.968, and Esd was 0.997. By comparing the skin thickness of the abdomen, chest, and left finger, it was found that there was a significant difference between the LS group and the control group (P < 0.05). When the shell was 2 mm, the effect of sensitivity specificity on SWE imaging was better than that when the shell was 1 mm. In summary, the improved NLM algorithm showed excellent denoising effects on the ultrasonic images of LS patients. Besides, it could assist clinicians in ultrasonic imaging diagnosis for LS patients and effectively improve the diagnostic accuracy of diseases."

However, acquiring visual expertise is tedious and time-consuming and the perceptual strategies mediating visual categorization skills are poorly understood. In this paper, the Ease algorithm was developed to predict an item's categorization difficulty (Ease value) based on the item's perceptual similarity to all within-category items versus between-category items in the dataset. In this study, Ease values were used to construct an easy-to-hard and hard-to-easy training schedule for teaching melanoma diagnosis. Whereas previous visual training studies suggest that an easy-to-hard schedule benefits learning outcomes, no studies to date have demonstrated the easy-to-hard advantage with complex, real-world images. In our study, 237 melanoma and benign images were collected for training and testing purposes. The diagnostic accuracy of images was verified by an expert dermatologist. Based on their Ease values, the items were grouped into easy, medium, and hard categories, each containing an equal number of melanoma and benign lesions. During training, participants categorized images of skin lesions as either benign or melanoma and were given corrective feedback after each trial. In the easy-to-hard training condition, participants learned to categorize all the easy items first, followed by the medium items, and finally the hard items. Participants in the hard-to-easy training condition learned items in the reverse order. Post-training results showed that training in both conditions transferred to the classification of new melanoma and benign images. Participants in the easy-to-hard condition showed modest advantages both in the acquisition and retention of the melanoma diagnosis skills, but neither scheduling condition exhibited a gross advantage. The Ease values of the items predicted categorization accuracy after, but not before training, suggesting that the Ease algorithm is a promising tool for optimizing medical training in visual categorization."

The psoriasis area severity index (PASI) score, a tool used to evaluate the severity of psoriasis, is currently used in clinical trials and clinical research. The determination of severity is based on the subjective judgment of the clinician. Thus, the disease evaluation deviations are induced. Therefore, we propose optimal algorithms that can effectively segment the lesion area and classify the severity. In addition, a new dataset on psoriasis was built, including patch images of erythema and scaling. We performed psoriasis lesion segmentation and classified the disease severity. In addition, we evaluated the best-performing segmentation method and classifier and analyzed features that are highly related to the severity of psoriasis. In conclusion, we presented the optimal techniques for evaluating the severity of psoriasis. Our newly constructed dataset improved the generalization performance of psoriasis diagnosis and evaluation. It proposed an optimal system for specific evaluation indicators of the disease and a quantitative PASI scoring method.

The fast rise of deep learning, particularly in clinical decision support tools, has provided exciting solutions primarily in medical imaging. In the past, ANNs (artificial neural networks) have been used extensively in dermatology and have shown promising results for detecting various skin diseases. Eczema represents a group of skin conditions characterized by irritated, dry, inflamed, and itchy skin. This study extends great help to automate the diagnosis process of various kinds of eczema through a Hybrid model that uses concatenated ReliefF optimized handcrafted and deep activated features and a support vector machine for classification. Deep learning models and standard image processing techniques have been used to classify eczema from images automatically. This work contributes to the first multiclass image dataset, namely EIR (Eczema image resource). The EIR dataset consists of 2039 labeled eczema images belonging to seven categories. We performed a comparative analysis of multiple ensemble models, attention mechanisms, and data augmentation techniques for this task. The respective accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, for eczema classification by classifiers were recorded. In comparison, the proposed Hybrid 6 network achieved the highest accuracy of 88.29%, sensitivity of 85.19%, and specificity of 90.33%% among all employed models. Our findings suggest that deep learning models can classify eczema with high accuracy, and their performance is comparable to dermatologists. However, many factors have been elucidated that contribute to reducing accuracy and potential scope for improvement."

We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities per algorithm and threshold using the bivariate hierarchical model. We investigated the impact of: in-person test interpretation; use of a purposely developed algorithm to assist diagnosis; and observer expertise.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 49 publications reporting on a total of 51 study cohorts with 34,351 lesions (including 2499 cases), providing 134 datasets for visual inspection. Across almost all study quality domains, the majority of study reports provided insufficient information to allow us to judge the risk of bias, while in three of four domains that we assessed we scored concerns regarding applicability of study findings as 'high'. Selective participant recruitment, lack of detail regarding the threshold for deciding on a positive test result, and lack of detail on observer expertise were particularly problematic.Attempts to analyse studies by degree of prior testing were hampered by a lack of relevant information and by the restricted inclusion of lesions selected for biopsy or excision. Accuracy was generally much higher for in-person diagnosis compared to image-based evaluations (relative diagnostic odds ratio of 8.54, 95% CI 2.89 to 25.3, P < 0.001). Meta-analysis of in-person evaluations that could be clearly placed on the clinical pathway showed a general trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, with the highest sensitivity (92.4%, 95% CI 26.2% to 99.8%) and lowest specificity (79.7%, 95% CI 73.7% to 84.7%) observed in participants with limited prior testing (n = 3 datasets). Summary sensitivities were lower for those referred for specialist assessment but with much higher specificities (e.g. sensitivity 76.7%, 95% CI 61.7% to 87.1%) and specificity 95.7%, 95% CI 89.7% to 98.3%) for lesions selected for excision, n = 8 datasets). These differences may be related to differences in the spectrum of included lesions, differences in the definition of a positive test result, or to variations in observer expertise. We did not find clear evidence that accuracy is improved by the use of any algorithm to assist diagnosis in all settings. Attempts to examine the effect of observer expertise in melanoma diagnosis were hindered due to poor reporting.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Visual inspection is a fundamental component of the assessment of a suspicious skin lesion; however, the evidence suggests that melanomas will be missed if visual inspection is used on its own. The evidence to support its accuracy in the range of settings in which it is used is flawed and very poorly reported. Although published algorithms do not appear to improve accuracy, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the 'no algorithm' approach should be preferred in all settings. Despite the volume of research evaluating visual inspection, further prospective evaluation of the potential added value of using established algorithms according to the prior testing or diagnostic difficulty of lesions may be warranted."

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is almost always a localised skin cancer with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue, whereas a minority of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs) and invasive melanomas are higher-risk skin cancers with the potential to metastasise and cause death. Dermoscopy has become an important tool to assist specialist clinicians in the diagnosis of melanoma, and is increasingly used in primary-care settings. Dermoscopy is a precision-built handheld illuminated magnifier that allows more detailed examination of the skin down to the level of the superficial dermis. Establishing the value of dermoscopy over and above visual inspection for the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC in primary- and secondary-care settings is critical to understanding its potential contribution to appropriate skin cancer triage, including referral of higher-risk cancers to secondary care, the identification of low-risk skin cancers that might be treated in primary care and to provide reassurance to those with benign skin lesions who can be safely discharged.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection and dermoscopy, alone or in combination, for the detection of (a) BCC and (b) cSCC, in adults.

We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic thresholds were missing. We estimated accuracy using hierarchical summary ROC methods. We undertook analysis of studies allowing direct comparison between tests. To facilitate interpretation of results, we computed values of sensitivity at the point on the SROC curve with 80% fixed specificity and values of specificity with 80% fixed sensitivity. We investigated the impact of in-person test interpretation; use of a purposely-developed algorithm to assist diagnosis; and observer expertise.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 24 publications reporting on 24 study cohorts, providing 27 visual inspection datasets (8805 lesions; 2579 malignancies) and 33 dermoscopy datasets (6855 lesions; 1444 malignancies). The risk of bias was mainly low for the index test (for dermoscopy evaluations) and reference standard domains, particularly for in-person evaluations, and high or unclear for participant selection, application of the index test for visual inspection and for participant flow and timing. We scored concerns about the applicability of study findings as of 'high' or 'unclear' concern for almost all studies across all domains assessed. Selective participant recruitment, lack of reproducibility of diagnostic thresholds and lack of detail on observer expertise were particularly problematic.The detection of BCC was reported in 28 datasets; 15 on an in-person basis and 13 image-based. Analysis of studies by prior testing of participants and according to observer expertise was not possible due to lack of data. Studies were primarily conducted in participants referred for specialist assessment of lesions with available histological classification. We found no clear differences in accuracy between dermoscopy studies undertaken in person and those which evaluated images. The lack of effect observed may be due to other sources of heterogeneity, including variations in the types of skin lesion studied, in dermatoscopes used, or in the use of algorithms and varying thresholds for deciding on a positive test result.Meta-analysis found in-person evaluations of dermoscopy (7 evaluations; 4683 lesions and 363 BCCs) to be more accurate than visual inspection alone for the detection of BCC (8 evaluations; 7017 lesions and 1586 BCCs), with a relative diagnostic odds ratio (RDOR) of 8.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5 to 19.3; P < 0.001). This corresponds to predicted differences in sensitivity of 14% (93% versus 79%) at a fixed specificity of 80% and predicted differences in specificity of 22% (99% versus 77%) at a fixed sensitivity of 80%. We observed very similar results for the image-based evaluations.When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions, of which 170 are BCC (based on median BCC prevalence across studies), an increased sensitivity of 14% from dermoscopy would lead to 24 fewer BCCs missed, assuming 166 false positive results from both tests. A 22% increase in specificity from dermoscopy with sensitivity fixed at 80% would result in 183 fewer unnecessary excisions, assuming 34 BCCs missed for both tests. There was not enough evidence to assess the use of algorithms or structured checklists for either visual inspection or dermoscopy.Insufficient data were available to draw conclusions on the accuracy of either test for the detection of cSCCs.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Dermoscopy may be a valuable tool for the diagnosis of BCC as an adjunct to visual inspection of a suspicious skin lesion following a thorough history-taking including assessment of risk factors for keratinocyte cancer. The evidence primarily comes from secondary-care (referred) populations and populations with pigmented lesions or mixed lesion types. There is no clear evidence supporting the use of currently-available formal algorithms to assist dermoscopy diagnosis."

Knowledge of BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry (IHC) results can streamline decisions during initial oncology consultations, prior to DNA-based test results. In the absence of formal guidelines that require pathologist initiated ('reflex') BRAF mutation testing, our institution developed a local protocol to perform BRAF V600E IHC on specimens from all stage III/IV melanoma patients when the status is otherwise unknown. This study was designed to evaluate the application of this protocol in a tertiary referral pathology department. A total of 408 stage III/IV melanoma patients had tissue specimens accessioned between 1 January and 31 March in three consecutive years (from 2019 to 2021), reported by 32 individual pathologists. The BRAF mutation status was established by pathologists in 87% (352/408) of cases. When a prior BRAF mutation status was previously known, as confirmed in linked electronic records (202/408), this status had been communicated by the clinician on the pathology request form in 1% of cases (3/202). Pathologists performed BRAF V600E IHC in 153 cases (74% of cases where the status was unknown, 153/206) and testing was duplicated in 5% of cases (20/408). Reflex BRAF IHC testing was omitted in 26% of cases (53/206), often on specimens with small volume disease (cytology specimens or sentinel node biopsies) despite adequate tissue for testing. Incorporating BRAF IHC testing within routine diagnostic protocols of stage III/IV melanoma was both feasible and successful in most cases. Communication of a patient's BRAF mutation status via the pathology request form will likely improve implementation of pathologist initiated BRAF mutation testing and may result in a reduction of duplicate tests. To improve pathologist reflex testing rates, we advocate for the use of an algorithmic approach to pathologist initiated BRAF mutation testing utilising both IHC and DNA-based methodologies for stage III/IV melanoma patients."

            "abstract": "Melanoma is defined as a disease that has been incurable in advanced stages, which shows the vital importance of timely diagnosis and treatment. To diagnose this type of cancer early, various methods and equipment have been used, almost all of which required a visit to the doctor and were not available to the public. In this study, an automated and accurate process to differentiate between benign skin pigmented lesions and malignant melanoma is presented, so that it can be used by the general public, and it does not require special equipment and special conditions in imaging. In this study, after preprocessing of the input images, the region of interest is segmented based on the Otsu method. Then, a new feature extraction is implemented on the segmented image to mine the beneficial characteristics. The process is then finalized by using an optimized Deep Believe Network (DBN) for categorization into 2 classes of normal and melanoma cases. The optimization process in DBN has been performed by a developed version of the newly introduced Thermal Exchange Optimization (dTEO) algorithm to obtain higher efficacy in different terms. To show the method's superiority, its performance is compared with 7 different techniques from the literature."

Lesion segmentation is an initial step in CAD schemes as it leads to low error rates in quantification of the structure, boundary, and scale of the skin lesion. Subjective clinical assessment of the skin lesion segmentation results provided by current state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation techniques does not offer the required results as per the inter-observer agreement of expert dermatologists. This study proposes a novel deep learning-based, fully automated approach to skin lesion segmentation, including sophisticated pre and postprocessing approaches. We use three deep learning models, including UNet, deep residual U-Net (ResUNet), and improved ResUNet (ResUNet++). The preprocessing phase combines morphological filters with an inpainting algorithm to eliminate unnecessary hair structures from the dermoscopic images. Finally, we used test time augmentation (TTA) and conditional random field (CRF) in the postprocessing stage to improve segmentation accuracy. The proposed method was trained and evaluated on ISIC-2016 and ISIC-2017 skin lesion datasets. It achieved an average Jaccard Index of 85.96% and 80.05% for ISIC-2016 and ISIC-2017 datasets, when trained individually. When trained on combined dataset (ISIC-2016 and ISIC-2017), the proposed method achieved an average Jaccard Index of 80.73% and 90.02% on ISIC-2017 and ISIC-2016 testing datasets.

            "abstract": "Melanoma is one of the most dangerous skin cancers. The current melanoma segmentation is mainly based on FCNs (fully connected networks) and U-Net. Nevertheless, these two kinds of neural networks are prone to parameter redundancy, and the gradient of neural networks disappears that occurs when the neural network backpropagates as the neural network gets deeper, which will reduce the Jaccard index of the skin lesion image segmentation model. To solve the above problems and improve the survival rate of melanoma patients, an improved skin lesion segmentation model based on deformable 3D convolution and ResU-NeXt++ (D3DC- ResU-NeXt++) is proposed in this paper. The new modules in D3DC-ResU-NeXt++ can replace ordinary modules in the existing 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can be trained efficiently through standard backpropagation with high segmentation accuracy. In particular, we introduce a new data preprocessing method with dilation, crop operation, resizing, and hair removal (DCRH), which improves the Jaccard index of skin lesion image segmentation. Because rectified Adam (RAdam) does not easily fall into a local optimal solution and can converge quickly in segmentation model training, we also introduce RAdam as the training optimizer. The experiments show that our model has excellent performance on the segmentation of the ISIC2018 Task I dataset, and the Jaccard index achieves 86.84%. The proposed method improves the Jaccard index of segmentation of skin lesion images and can also assist dermatological doctors in determining and diagnosing the types of skin lesions and the boundary between lesions and normal skin, so as to improve the survival rate of skin cancer patients. Overview of the proposed model. An improved skin lesion segmentation model based on deformable 3D convolution and ResU-NeXt++ (D3DC- ResU-NeXt++) is proposed in this paper. D3DC-ResU-NeXt++ has strong spatial geometry processing capabilities, it is used to segment the skin lesion sample image; DCRH and transfer learning are used to preprocess the data set and D3DC-ResU-NeXt++ respectively, which can highlight the difference between the lesion area and the normal skin, and enhance the segmentation efficiency and robustness of the neural network; RAdam is used to speed up the convergence speed of neural network and improve the efficiency of segmentation."

In current clinical setting, abrupt cutoff of a skin lesion determined by an examination of a dermatologist. This process is subjective, nonquantitative, and error-prone. We present an improved computational model to quantitatively measure abruptness of a skin lesion over our previous method. To achieve this, we quantitatively analyze the texture features of a region within the lesion boundary. This region is bounded by an interior border line of the lesion boundary which is determined using level set propagation (LSP) method. This method provides a fast border contraction without a need for extensive boolean operations. Then, we build feature vectors of homogeneity, standard deviation of pixel values, and mean of the pixel values of the region between the contracted border and the original border. These vectors are then classified using neural networks (NN) and SVM classifiers.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      As lower homogeneity indicates sharp cutoffs, suggesting melanoma, we carried out our experiments on two dermoscopy image datasets, which consist of 800 benign and 200 malignant melanoma cases. LSP method helped produce better results than Kaya et al., 2016 study. By using texture homogeneity at the periphery of a lesion border determined by LSP, as a classification results, we obtained 87% f1-score and 78% specificity; that we obtained better results than in the previous study. We also compared the performances of two different NN classifiers and support vector machine classifier. The best results obtained using combination of RGB color spaces with the fully-connected multi-hidden layer NN.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Computational results also show that skin lesion abrupt cutoff is a reliable indicator of malignancy. Results show that computational model of texture homogeneity along the periphery of skin lesion borders based on LSP is an effective way of quantitatively measuring abrupt cutoff of a lesion."

            "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of melanoma, with accuracies comparable to those achieved by dermatologists. However, the performance of a CNN trained with only clinical images of a pigmented skin lesion in a clinical image classification task, in competition with dermatologists, has not been reported to date. In this study, we extracted 5846 clinical images of pigmented skin lesions from 3551 patients. Pigmented skin lesions included malignant tumors (malignant melanoma and basal cell carcinoma) and benign tumors (nevus, seborrhoeic keratosis, senile lentigo, and hematoma/hemangioma). We created the test dataset by randomly selecting 666 patients out of them and picking one image per patient, and created the training dataset by giving bounding-box annotations to the rest of the images (4732 images, 2885 patients). Subsequently, we trained a faster, region-based CNN (FRCNN) with the training dataset and checked the performance of the model on the test dataset. In addition, ten board-certified dermatologists (BCDs) and ten dermatologic trainees (TRNs) took the same tests, and we compared their diagnostic accuracy with FRCNN. For six-class classification, the accuracy of FRCNN was 86.2%, and that of the BCDs and TRNs was 79.5% (p = 0.0081) and 75.1% (p < 0.00001), respectively. For two-class classification (benign or malignant), the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 91.5%, 83.3%, and 94.5% by FRCNN; 86.6%, 86.3%, and 86.6% by BCD; and 85.3%, 83.5%, and 85.9% by TRN, respectively. False positive rates and positive predictive values were 5.5% and 84.7% by FRCNN, 13.4% and 70.5% by BCD, and 14.1% and 68.5% by TRN, respectively. We compared the classification performance of FRCNN with 20 dermatologists. As a result, the classification accuracy of FRCNN was better than that of the dermatologists. In the future, we plan to implement this system in society and have it used by the general public, in order to improve the prognosis of skin cancer."

Early detection of melanoma is possible through visual inspection of pigmented lesions over the skin, treated with simple excision of the cancerous cells. However, due to the limited availability of dermatologists, the visual inspection alone has the limited and variable accuracy that leads the patient to undergo a series of biopsies and complicates the treatment. In this work, a deep learning method is proposed for automated Melanoma region segmentation using dermoscopic images to overcome the challenges of automated Melanoma region segmentation within dermoscopic images.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      A deep region based convolutional neural network (RCNN) precisely detects the multiple affected regions in the form of bounding boxes that simplify localization through Fuzzy C-mean (FCM) clustering. Our method constitutes of three step process: skin refinement, localization of Melanoma region, and finally segmentation of Melanoma. We applied the proposed method on benchmark dataset ISIC-2016 by International Symposium on biomedical images (ISBI) having 900 training and 376 testing Melanoma dermatological images.\n    \n\n\n          Main findings:\n        \n      \n      The performance is evaluated for Melanoma segmentation using various quantitative measures.

            "abstract": "In recent years, vast developments in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) for skin diseases have generated much interest from clinicians and other eventual end-users of this technology. Introducing clinical domain knowledge to these machine learning strategies can help dispel the black box nature of these tools, strengthening clinician trust. Clinical domain knowledge also provides new information channels which can improve CAD diagnostic performance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for malignant melanoma (MM) detection by fusing clinical images and dermoscopic images. The proposed method combines a multi-labeled deep feature extractor and clinically constrained classifier chain (CC). This allows the 7-point checklist, a clinician diagnostic algorithm, to be included in the decision level while maintaining the clinical importance of the major and minor criteria in the checklist. Our proposed framework achieved an average accuracy of 81.3% for detecting all criteria and melanoma when testing on a publicly available 7-point checklist dataset. This is the highest reported results, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in the literature by 6.4% or more. Analyses also show that the proposed system surpasses the single modality system of using either clinical images or dermoscopic images alone and the systems without adopting the approach of multi-label and clinically constrained classifier chain. Our carefully designed system demonstrates a substantial improvement over melanoma detection. By keeping the familiar major and minor criteria of the 7-point checklist and their corresponding weights, the proposed system may be more accepted by physicians as a human-interpretable CAD tool for automated melanoma detection."

Although previous studies have used artificial intelligence (AI) to classify lesions as benign or malignant, there have not been extensive studies examining the use of AI on identifying and categorizing a primary skin lesion's morphology. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a standalone AI tool to correctly categorize a skin lesion's morphology from a test bank of images. To provide a marker of performance, we evaluate the accuracy of primary care physicians to categorize skin lesion morphology in the same test bank of images without any aids and then with the aid of a simple visual guide. The AI system achieved an accuracy of 68% in determining the single most likely morphology from the test image bank. When the AI's top prediction was broadened to its top three most likely predictions, accuracy improved to 80%. In comparison, the diagnostic accuracy of primary care physicians was 36% without any aids and 68% with the visual guide (P < 0.001). The AI was subsequently tested on an additional set of 222 heterogeneous images of varying Fitzpatrick skin types and achieved an overall accuracy of 70% in the Fitzpatrick I-III skin type group and 68% in the Fitzpatrick IV-VI skin type group (P = 0.79). An AI is a powerful tool to assist physicians in the diagnosis of skin lesions while still requiring the user to critically consider other possible diagnoses."

The segmentation is done on melanoma and Basal-cell carcinoma tumors, the most common skin cancer types, and could be used for diagnosis and surgical excision planning in a clinical context. Compared with previously proposed algorithms, which tend to underestimate the size of the lesion, we propose two new boundary terms which provide significant improvements of the accuracy. The first is a probabilistic boundary expansion (PBE) term designed to broaden the segmented area at the boundaries, which uses the feature asymmetry criterion. The second is a curvature dependent regularization (CDR), which aims at overcoming the tendency of standard regularization to shrink segmented areas. On a clinical dataset of 12 patients annotated by a dermatologist, the proposed algorithm has a comparable Dice index but increases the sensitivity by 26%. The proposed algorithm improves the sensitivity for all lesions, and the obtained sensitivity is close to that of the intra-observer variability."

Computer-aided diagnostic systems using deep convolutional neural networks are gaining importance in order to cope with difficulties. This study focuses on deep learning-based fusion networks and fusion loss functions. For the automatic segmentation of skin lesions, U-Net (U-Net + ResNet 2D) with 2D residual blocks and 2D volumetric convolutional neural networks were fused for the first time in this study. Also, a new fusion loss function is proposed by combining Dice Loss (DL) and Focal Tversky Loss (FTL) to make the proposed fused model more robust. Of the 2594 image dataset, 20% is reserved for test data and 80% for training data. In test data training, a Jaccard score of 0.837 and a dice score of 0.918 were obtained. The proposed model was also scored on the ISIC 2018 Task 1 test images, whose ground truths were not shared. The proposed model performed well and achieved a Jaccard index of 0.800 and a dice score of 0.880 in the ISIC 2018 Task 1 test set. In addition, it has been observed that the new fused loss function obtained by fusing Focal Tversky Loss and Dice Loss functions in the proposed model increases the robustness of the model in the tests. The proposed new loss function fusion model has outstripped the cutting-edge approaches in the literature."

As the patient may no longer be present at the time of image interpretation, quality assurance is key during image acquisition. Herein, we introduce a quality assurance process by means of automatically quantifying diagnostically uninformative areas within the lesional area by using RCM and coregistered dermoscopy images together. We trained and validated a pixel-level segmentation model on 117 RCM mosaics collected by international collaborators. The model delineates diagnostically uninformative areas with 82% sensitivity and 93% specificity. We further tested the model on a separate set of 372 coregistered RCM-dermoscopic image pairs and illustrate how the results of the RCM-only model can be improved via a multimodal (RCM + dermoscopy) approach, which can help quantify the uninformative regions within the lesional area.

Specifically, spitzoid melanocytic tumors are one of the most challenging melanocytic lesions due to their ambiguous morphological features. The gold standard for its diagnosis and prognosis is the analysis of skin biopsies. In this process, dermatopathologists visualize skin histology slides under a microscope, in a highly time-consuming and subjective task. In the last years, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have emerged as a promising tool that could support pathologists in daily clinical practice. Nevertheless, no automatic CAD systems have yet been proposed for the analysis of spitzoid lesions. Regarding common melanoma, no system allows both the selection of the tumor region and the prediction of the benign or malignant form in the diagnosis. Motivated by this, we propose a novel end-to-end weakly supervised deep learning model, based on inductive transfer learning with an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) to refine the embedding features of the latent space. The framework is composed of a source model in charge of finding the tumor patch-level patterns, and a target model focuses on the specific diagnosis of a biopsy. The latter retrains the backbone of the source model through a multiple instance learning workflow to obtain the biopsy-level scoring. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we performed extensive experiments on a private skin database with spitzoid lesions. Test results achieved an accuracy of 0.9231 and 0.80 for the source and the target models, respectively. In addition, the heat map findings are directly in line with the clinicians' medical decision and even highlight, in some cases, patterns of interest that were overlooked by the pathologist."

However it suffers drawbacks: it requires a strong expertise and is time-consuming. Moreover the notion of atypia or dysplasia of the visible cells used for diagnosis is very subjective, with poor inter-rater agreement reported in the literature. Lastly, histology requires a biopsy which is an invasive procedure and only captures a small sample of the lesion, which is insufficient in the context of large fields of cancerization. Here we demonstrate that the notion of cellular atypia can be objectively defined and quantified with a non-invasive in-vivo approach in three dimensions (3D). A Deep Learning (DL) algorithm is trained to segment keratinocyte (KC) nuclei from Line-field Confocal Optical Coherence Tomography (LC-OCT) 3D images. Based on these segmentations, a series of quantitative, reproducible and biologically relevant metrics is derived to describe KC nuclei individually. We show that, using those metrics, simple and more complex definitions of atypia can be derived to discriminate between healthy and pathological skins, achieving Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) scores superior than 0.965, largely outperforming medical experts on the same task with an AUC of 0.766.

While 81.5% of responders were aware of AI as an emerging topic in pathology, only 18.8% had either good or excellent knowledge about AI. In terms of diagnosis classification, 42.6% saw strong or very strong potential for automated suggestion of skin tumor diagnoses. The corresponding figure for inflammatory skin diseases was 23.0% (Padj < 0.0001). For specific applications, the highest potential was considered for automated detection of mitosis (79.2%), automated suggestion of tumor margins (62.1%) and immunostaining evaluation (62.7%). The potential for automated suggestion of immunostaining (37.6%) and genetic panels (48.3%) were lower. Age did not impact the overall attitudes toward AI. Only 6.0% of the responders agreed or strongly agreed that the human pathologist will be replaced by AI in the foreseeable future. For the entire group, 72.3% agreed or strongly agreed that AI will improve dermatopathology and 84.1% thought that AI should be a part of medical training. Conclusions: Pathologists are generally optimistic about the impact and potential benefit of AI in dermatopathology. The highest potential is expected for narrow specified tasks rather than a global automated suggestion of diagnoses. There is a strong need for education about AI and its use within dermatopathology."

Objective: To develop a convolutional neural network model to classify clinically relevant selected multiple-lesion skin diseases, this in accordance to the STARD guidelines. Methods: This was an image-based retrospective study using multi-task learning for binary classification. A VGG-16 model was trained on 16,543 non-standardized images. Image data was distributed in training set (80%), validation set (10%), and test set (10%). All images were collected from a clinical database of a Danish population attending one dermatological department. Included was patients categorized with ICD-10 codes related to acne, rosacea, psoriasis, eczema, and cutaneous t-cell lymphoma. Results: Acne was distinguished from rosacea with a sensitivity of 85.42% CI 72.24-93.93% and a specificity of 89.53% CI 83.97-93.68%, cutaneous t-cell lymphoma was distinguished from eczema with a sensitivity of 74.29% CI 67.82-80.05% and a specificity of 84.09% CI 80.83-86.99%, and psoriasis from eczema with a sensitivity of 81.79% CI 78.51-84.76% and a specificity of 73.57% CI 69.76-77.13%. All results were based on the test set. Conclusion: The performance rates reported were equal or superior to those reported for general practitioners with dermatological training, indicating that computer-aided diagnostic models based on convolutional neural network may potentially be employed for diagnosing multiple-lesion skin diseases."

            "abstract": "Acne vulgaris, the most common skin disease, can cause substantial economic and psychological impacts to the people it affects, and its accurate grading plays a crucial role in the treatment of patients. In this paper, we firstly proposed an acne grading criterion that considers lesion classifications and a metric for producing accurate severity ratings. Due to similar appearance of acne lesions with comparable severities and difficult-to-count lesions, severity assessment is a challenging task. We cropped facial skin images of several lesion patches and then addressed the acne lesion with a lightweight acne regular network (Acne-RegNet). Acne-RegNet was built by using a median filter and histogram equalization to improve image quality, a channel attention mechanism to boost the representational power of network, a region-based focal loss to handle classification imbalances and a model pruning and feature-based knowledge distillation to reduce model size. After the application of Acne-RegNet, the severity score is calculated, and the acne grading is further optimized by the metadata of the patients. The entire acne assessment procedure was deployed to a mobile device, and a phone app was designed. Compared with state-of-the-art lightweight models, the proposed Acne-RegNet significantly improves the accuracy of lesion classifications. The acne app demonstrated promising results in severity assessments (accuracy: 94.56%) and showed a dermatologist-level diagnosis on the internal clinical dataset.The proposed acne app could be a useful adjunct to assess acne severity in clinical practice and it enables anyone with a smartphone to immediately assess acne, anywhere and anytime."

However, studies on machine-learning-aided diagnosis of depigmented non-melanocytic lesions, which are more difficult to diagnose by unaided eye, are very few. Objective: We aim to assess the performance of deep learning methods for diagnosing vitiligo by deploying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and comparing their diagnosis accuracy with that of human raters with different levels of experience. Methods: A Chinese in-house dataset (2,876 images) and a world-wide public dataset (1,341 images) containing vitiligo and other depigmented/hypopigmented lesions were constructed. Three CNN models were trained on close-up images in both datasets. The results by the CNNs were compared with those by 14 human raters from four groups: expert raters (>10 years of experience), intermediate raters (5-10 years), dermatology residents, and general practitioners. F1 score, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity metrics were used to compare the performance of the CNNs with that of the raters. Results: For the in-house dataset, CNNs achieved a comparable F1 score (mean [standard deviation]) with expert raters (0.8864 [0.005] vs. 0.8933 [0.044]) and outperformed intermediate raters (0.7603 [0.029]), dermatology residents (0.6161 [0.068]) and general practitioners (0.4964 [0.139]). For the public dataset, CNNs achieved a higher F1 score (0.9684 [0.005]) compared to the diagnosis of expert raters (0.9221 [0.031]).

Modern technological developments and research methodologies made it possible to detect and identify this kind of skin cancer more effectively; however, the automated localization and segmentation of skin lesion at earlier stages is still a challenging task due to the low contrast between melanoma moles and skin portion and a higher level of color similarity between melanoma-affected and -nonaffected areas. In this paper, we present a fully automated method for segmenting the skin melanoma at its earliest stage by employing a deep-learning-based approach, namely faster region-based convolutional neural networks (RCNN) along with fuzzy k-means clustering (FKM). Several clinical images are utilized to test the presented method so that it may help the dermatologist in diagnosing this life-threatening disease at its earliest stage. The presented method first preprocesses the dataset images to remove the noise and illumination problems and enhance the visual information before applying the faster-RCNN to obtain the feature vector of fixed length. After that, FKM has been employed to segment the melanoma-affected portion of skin with variable size and boundaries. The performance of the presented method is evaluated on the three standard datasets, namely ISBI-2016, ISIC-2017, and PH2, and the results show that the presented method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The presented method attains an average accuracy of 95.40, 93.1, and 95.6% on the ISIC-2016, ISIC-2017, and PH2 datasets, respectively, which is showing its robustness to skin lesion recognition and segmentation."

            "abstract": "Microcystic lymphatic malformations as described in the international literature form a subgroup of low-flow congenital vascular malformations (VM) resulting from irregular embryological development. Microcystic lesions normally manifest as an accumulation of lymph- and blood-filled vesicles that, when externalized, cause skin maceration with consequent pain and potential infection resulting in the impairment of the patient's quality of life. There is no consensus on a standardized algorithm nor clear guidelines for successful treatment of this type of lymphatic malformation, and treatment options employed often result in ambivalent and transient outcomes with a high rate of recurrence. The topical formulation of tacrolimus is a well-known FDAapproved anti-T cell agent that was recently identified as a potent activator of ALK1, which is involved in several processes and functions including angiogenesis. We investigated if topical administration of tacrolimus may be an effective therapy for directly targeting cutaneous microcystic lymphatic malformations as a complement to systemic treatment. The study enrolled four patients with cutaneous microcystic lymphatic malformations: three male (ages: 13,15,18) and one female (age: 30). Two of the patients presented lesions on their backs, one patient on the left hand and one on the left lower limb. All four patients received treatment with topical tacrolimus 0.1% twice a day for 10 weeks on a previously selected area for application. Weekly clinical follow-ups were conducted along with close physician-patient contact. All patients displayed a satisfactory response after treatment. Lymphorrhea and bleeding were stopped in all cases and the esthetic aspect of lesions improved in two patients. To date, all patients presented no clinically significant changes to the size or extension of the lesion. Topical tacrolimus treatment is a promising and reasonable option for microcystic lymphatic malformations. Our results encourage further exploration in larger populations with the consideration that it is a safe and effective alternative or complementary therapy to systemic treatment."

Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a relatively new, non-invasive imaging technique that allows screening lesions at a cellular resolution. However, one of the main disadvantages of the RCM is frequently occurring artifacts which makes the diagnostic process more time consuming and hard to automate using e.g. end-to-end deep learning approach. A tool to automatically determine the RCM mosaic quality could be beneficial for both the lesion classification and informing the user (dermatologist) about its quality in real-time, during the examination procedure. In this work, we propose an attention-based deep network to automatically determine if a given RCM mosaic has an acceptable quality. We achieved accuracy above 87% on the test set which may considerably improve further classification results and the RCM-based examination."

            "abstract": "The skin is the largest organ of the human body, and many visceral diseases will be directly reflected on the skin, so it is of great clinical significance to accurately segment the skin lesion images. To address the characteristics of complex color, blurred boundaries, and uneven scale information, a skin lesion image segmentation method based on dense atrous spatial pyramid pooling (DenseASPP) and attention mechanism is proposed. The method is based on the U-shaped network (U-Net). Firstly, a new encoder is redesigned to replace the ordinary convolutional stacking with a large number of residual connections, which can effectively retain key features even after expanding the network depth. Secondly, channel attention is fused with spatial attention, and residual connections are added so that the network can adaptively learn channel and spatial features of images. Finally, the DenseASPP module is introduced and redesigned to expand the perceptual field size and obtain multi-scale feature information. The algorithm proposed in this paper has obtained satisfactory results in the official public dataset of the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC 2016). The mean Intersection over Union (mIOU), sensitivity (SE), precision (PC), accuracy (ACC), and Dice coefficient (Dice) are 0.901 8, 0.945 9, 0.948 7, 0.968 1, 0.947 3, respectively.

In the context that doctors at provincial hospitals and health facilities are overloaded, doctors at lower levels lack experience, and having a tool to support doctors in the process of diagnosing skin diseases quickly and accurately is essential. Along with the strong development of artificial intelligence technologies, many solutions to support the diagnosis of skin diseases have been researched and developed. In this paper, a combination of one Deep Learning model (DenseNet, InceptionNet, ResNet, etc) with Soft-Attention, which unsupervisedly extract a heat map of main skin lesions. Furthermore, personal information including age and gender are also used. It is worth noting that a new loss function that takes into account the data imbalance is also proposed. Experimental results on data set HAM10000 show that using InceptionResNetV2 with Soft-Attention and the new loss function gives 90 percent accuracy, mean of precision, F1-score, recall, and AUC of 0.81, 0.81, 0.82, and 0.99, respectively. Besides, using MobileNetV3Large combined with Soft-Attention and the new loss function, even though the number of parameters is 11 times less and the number of hidden layers is 4 times less, it achieves an accuracy of 0.86 and 30 times faster diagnosis than InceptionResNetV2."

            "abstract": "Diabetic skin manifestations, previous to ulcers and wounds, are not highly accounted as part of diagnosis even when they represent the first symptom of vascular damage and are present in up to 70% of patients with diabetes mellitus type II. Here, an application for skin macules characterization based on a three-stage segmentation and characterization algorithm used to classify vascular, petechiae, trophic changes, and trauma macules from digital photographs of the lower limbs is presented. First, in order to find the skin region, a logical multiplication is performed on two skin masks obtained from color space transformations; dynamic thresholds are stabilised to self-adjust to a variety of skin tones. Then, in order to locate the lesion region, illumination enhancement is performed using a chromatic model color space, followed by a principal component analysis gray-scale transformation. Finally, characteristics of each type of macule are considered and classified; morphologic properties (area, axes, perimeter, and solidity), intensity properties, and a set of shade indices (red, green, blue, and brown) are proposed as a measure to obviate skin color differences among subjects. The values calculated show differences between macules with a statistical significance, which agree with the physician's diagnosis. Later, macule properties are fed to an artificial neural network classifier, which proved a 97.5% accuracy, to differentiate between them. Characterization is useful in order to track macule changes and development along time, provides meaningful information to provide early treatments, and offers support in the prevention of amputations due to diabetic feet. A graphical user interface was designed to show the properties of the macules; this application could be the background of a future Diagnosis Assistance Tool for educational (i.e., untrained physicians) and preventive assistance technology purposes."

            "abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancers that is sometimes difficult for doctors and experts to diagnose. The noninvasive dermatoscopic method is a popular method for observing and diagnosing skin cancer. Because this method is based on ocular inference, the skin cancer diagnosis by the dermatologists is difficult, especially in the early stages of the disease. Artificial intelligence is a proper complementary tool that can be used alongside the experts to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis. In the present study, a new computer-aided method has been introduced for the diagnosis of the skin cancer. The method is designed based on combination of deep learning and a newly introduced metaheuristic algorithm, namely, Wildebeest Herd Optimization (WHO) Algorithm. The method uses an Inception convolutional neural network for the initial features' extraction. Afterward, the WHO algorithm has been employed for selecting the useful features to decrease the analysis time complexity. The method is then performed to an ISIC-2008 skin cancer dataset. Final results of the feature selection based on the proposed WHO are compared with three other algorithms, and the results have indicated good results for the system. Finally, the total diagnosis system has been compared with five other methods to indicate its effectiveness against the studied methods. Final results showed that the proposed method has the best results than the comparative methods."

The performances of the three above-mentioned algorithms are compared from different perspectives. In addition, some images from the Cifar10 dataset are applied as the out-of-domain data and the performances of the algorithms are evaluated and compared for images that are far from the training samples.

            "abstract": "Skin lesion border irregularity, which represents the B feature in the ABCD rule, is considered one of the most significant factors in melanoma diagnosis. Since signs that clinicians rely on in melanoma diagnosis involve subjective judgment including visual signs such as border irregularity, this deems it necessary to develop an objective approach to finding border irregularity. Increased research in neural networks has been carried out in recent years mainly driven by the advances of deep learning. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or multilayer perceptrons have been shown to perform well in supervised learning tasks. However, such networks usually don't incorporate information pertaining the ambiguity of the inputs when training the network, which in turn could affect how the weights are being updated in the learning process and eventually degrading the performance of the network when applied on test data. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy multilayer perceptron (F-MLP) that takes the ambiguity of the inputs into consideration and subsequently reduces the effects of ambiguous inputs on the learning process. A new optimization function, the fuzzy gradient descent, has been proposed to reflect those changes. Moreover, a type-II fuzzy sigmoid activation function has also been proposed which enables finding the range of performance the fuzzy neural network is able to attain. The fuzzy neural network was used to predict the skin lesion border irregularity, where the lesion was firstly segmented from the skin, the lesion border extracted, border irregularity measured using a proposed measure vector, and using the extracted border irregularity measures to train the neural network. The proposed approach outperformed most of the state-of-the-art classification methods in general and its standard neural network counterpart in particular. However, the proposed fuzzy neural network was more time-consuming when training the network."

There is a need to develop high-performance and low-cost data augmentation strategies for intelligent skin cancer screening devices that can be deployed in rural or underdeveloped communities. The proposed strategy can not only improve the classification performance of skin lesions but also highlight the potential regions of interest for clinicians' attention. This strategy can also be implemented in a broad range of clinical disciplines for early screening and automatic diagnosis of many other diseases in low resource settings. Methods. We propose a high-performance data augmentation strategy of search space 101, which can be combined with any model through a plug-and-play mode and search for the best argumentation method for a medical database with low resource cost. Results. With EfficientNets as a baseline, the best BACC of HAM10000 is 0.853, outperforming the other published models of \"single-model and no-external-database\" for ISIC 2018 Lesion Diagnosis Challenge (Task 3). The best average AUC performance on ISIC 2017 achieves 0.909 (±0.015), exceeding most of the ensembling models and those using external datasets. Performance on Derm7pt archives the best BACC of 0.735 (±0.018) ahead of all other related studies. Moreover, the model-based heatmaps generated by Grad-CAM++ verify the accurate selection of lesion features in model judgment, further proving the scientific rationality of model-based diagnosis. Conclusion. The proposed data augmentation strategy greatly reduces the computational cost for clinically intelligent diagnosis of skin lesions. It may also facilitate further research in low-cost, portable, and AI-based mobile devices for skin cancer screening and therapeutic guidance."

            "abstract": "The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing worldwide. If detected early, melanoma is highly treatable, so early detection is vital.Skin cancer early detection has improved significantly in recent decades, for example by the introduction of screening in 2008 and dermoscopy. Nevertheless, in particular visual detection of early melanomas remains challenging because they show many morphological overlaps with nevi. Hence, there continues to be a high medical need to further develop methods for early skin cancer detection in order to be able to reliably diagnosemelanomas at a very early stage.Routine diagnostics for melanoma detection include visual whole body inspection, often supplemented by dermoscopy, which can significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy of experienced dermatologists. A procedure that is additionally offered in some practices and clinics is wholebody photography combined with digital dermoscopy for the early detection of malignant melanoma, especially for monitoring high-risk patients.In recent decades, numerous noninvasive adjunctive diagnostic techniques were developed for the examination of suspicious pigmented moles, that may have the potential to allow improved and, in some cases, automated evaluation of these lesions. First, confocal laser microscopy should be mentioned here, as well as electrical impedance spectroscopy, multiphoton laser tomography, multispectral analysis, Raman spectroscopy or optical coherence tomography. These diagnostic techniques usually focus on high sensitivity to avoid malignant melanoma being overlooked. However, this usually implies lower specificity, which may lead to unnecessary excision of benign lesions in screening. Also, some of the procedures are time-consuming and costly, which also limits their applicability in skin cancer screening. In the near future, the use of artificial intelligence might change skin cancer diagnostics in many ways. The most promising approach may be the analysis of routine macroscopic and dermoscopic images by artificial intelligence.For the classification of pigmented skin lesions based on macroscopic and dermoscopic images, artificial intelligence, especially in form of neural networks, has achieved comparable diagnostic accuracies to dermatologists under experimental conditions in numerous studies. In particular, it achieved high accuracies in the binary melanoma/nevus classification task, but it also performed comparably well to dermatologists in multiclass differentiation of various skin diseases. However, proof of the basic applicability and utility of such systems in clinical practice is still pending. Prerequisites that remain to be established to enable translation of such diagnostic systems into dermatological routine are means that allow users to comprehend the system's decisions as well as a uniformly high performance of the algorithms on image data from other hospitals and practices.At present, hints are accumulating that computer-aided diagnosis systems could provide their greatest benefit as assistance systems, since studies indicate that a combination of human and machine achieves the best results. Diagnostic systems based on artificial intelligence are capable of detecting morphological characteristics quickly, quantitatively, objectively and reproducibly, and could thus provide a more objective analytical basis - in addition to medical experience."

Open-source skin images were downloaded from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) archive. Different deep neural networks (DNNs) (n = 8) were trained based on a random dataset constituted of 8015 images. A test set of 2003 images was used to assess the classifiers' performance at low (300 × 224 RGB) and high (600 × 450 RGB) image resolution and aggregated data (age, sex and lesion localization). We also organized two different contests to compare the DNN performance to that of general practitioners by means of unassisted image observation. Both at low and high image resolution, the DNN framework differentiated dermatological images with appreciable performance. In all cases, the accuracy was improved when adding clinical data to the framework. Finally, the least accurate DNN outperformed general practitioners. The physician's accuracy was statistically improved when allowed to use the output of this algorithmic framework as guidance. DNNs are proven to be high performers as skin lesion classifiers and can improve general practitioner diagnosis accuracy in a routine clinical scenario."

            "abstract": "Dermatologists often diagnose or rule out early melanoma by evaluating the follow-up dermoscopic images of skin lesions. However, existing algorithms for early melanoma diagnosis are developed using single time-point images of lesions. Ignoring the temporal, morphological changes of lesions can lead to misdiagnosis in borderline cases. In this study, we propose a framework for automated early melanoma diagnosis using sequential dermoscopic images. To this end, we construct our method in three steps. First, we align sequential dermoscopic images of skin lesions using estimated Euclidean transformations, extract the lesion growth region by computing image differences among the consecutive images, and then propose a spatio-temporal network to capture the dermoscopic changes from aligned lesion images and the corresponding difference images. Finally, we develop an early diagnosis module to compute probability scores of malignancy for lesion images over time. We collected 179 serial dermoscopic imaging data from 122 patients to verify our method. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model outperforms other commonly used sequence models. We also compared the diagnostic results of our model with those of seven experienced dermatologists and five registrars. Our model achieved higher diagnostic accuracy than clinicians (63.69% vs. 54.33%, respectively) and provided an earlier diagnosis of melanoma (60.7% vs. 32.7% of melanoma correctly diagnosed on the first follow-up images). These results demonstrate that our model can be used to identify melanocytic lesions that are at high-risk of malignant transformation earlier in the disease process and thereby redefine what is possible in the early detection of melanoma."

It is estimated that 16.5 million US adults (7.3%) have AD that initially began at age >2 years, with nearly 40% affected by moderate or severe disease. Therefore, a quantitative measurement that tracks the evolution of AD severity could be extremely useful in assessing patient evolution and therapeutic efficacy. Currently, SCOring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) is the most frequently used measurement tool in clinical practice. However, SCORAD has the following disadvantages: (i) time consuming-calculating SCORAD usually takes about 7-10 minutes per patient, which poses a heavy burden on dermatologists and (ii) inconsistency-owing to the complexity of SCORAD calculation, even well-trained dermatologists could give different scores for the same case. In this study, we introduce the Automatic SCORAD, an automatic version of the SCORAD that deploys state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks that measure AD severity by analyzing skin lesion images. Overall, we have shown that Automatic SCORAD may prove to be a rapid and objective alternative method for the automatic assessment of AD, achieving results comparable with those of human expert assessment while reducing interobserver variability."

Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images-two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets-consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care."

            "abstract": "Recent research revealed the superiority of artificial intelligence over dermatologists to diagnose melanoma from images. However, 30-50% of all melanomas and more than half of those in young patients evolve from initially benign lesions. Despite its high relevance for melanoma screening, neither clinicians nor computers are yet able to reliably predict a nevus' oncologic transformation. The cause of this lies in the static nature of lesion presentation in the current standard of care, both for clinicians and algorithms. The status quo makes it difficult to train algorithms (and clinicians) to precisely assess the likelihood of a benign skin lesion to transform into melanoma. In addition, it inhibits the precision of current algorithms since 'evolution' image features may not be part of their decision. The current literature reveals certain types of melanocytic nevi (i.e. 'spitzoid' or 'dysplastic' nevi) and criteria (i.e. visible vasculature) that, in general, appear to have a higher chance to transform into melanoma. However, owing to the cumulative nature of oncogenic mutations in melanoma, a more fine-grained early morphologic footprint is likely to be detectable by an algorithm. In this perspective article, the concept of melanoma prediction is further explored by the discussion of the evolution of melanoma, the concept for training of such a nevi classifier and the implications of early melanoma prediction for clinical practice. In conclusion, the authors believe that artificial intelligence trained on prospective image data could be transformative for skin cancer diagnostics by (a) predicting melanoma before it occurs (i.e. pre-in situ) and (b) further enhancing the accuracy of current melanoma classifiers. Necessary prospective images for this research are obtained via free mole-monitoring mobile apps."

It is either diagnosed malignant or benign - depending upon the severity of the infection and the current stage. The conventional methods require a detailed physical inspection by an expert dermatologist, which is time-consuming and imprecise. Therefore, several computer vision methods are introduced lately, which are cost-effective and somewhat accurate. In this work, we propose a new automated approach for skin lesion detection and recognition using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). The proposed cascaded design incorporates three fundamental steps including; a) contrast enhancement through fast local Laplacian filtering (FlLpF) along HSV color transformation; b) lesion boundary extraction using color CNN approach by following XOR operation; c) in-depth features extraction by applying transfer learning using Inception V3 model prior to feature fusion using hamming distance (HD) approach. An entropy controlled feature selection method is also introduced for the selection of the most discriminant features. The proposed method is tested on PH2 and ISIC 2017 datasets, whereas the recognition phase is validated on PH2, ISBI 2016, and ISBI 2017 datasets. From the results, it is concluded that the proposed method outperforms several existing methods and attained accuracy 98.4% on PH2 dataset, 95.1% on ISBI dataset and 94.8% on ISBI 2017 dataset."

Twenty-four patients were interviewed about a direct-to-patient AI tool and 24 patients were interviewed about a clinician decision-support AI tool. Interrater reliability ratings for the 2 coding teams were κ = 0.94 and κ = 0.89. Patients primarily conceptualized AI in terms of cognition. Increased diagnostic speed (29 participants [60%]) and health care access (29 [60%]) were the most commonly perceived benefits of AI for skin cancer screening; increased patient anxiety was the most commonly perceived risk (19 [40%]). Patients perceived both more accurate diagnosis (33 [69%]) and less accurate diagnosis (41 [85%]) to be the greatest strength and weakness of AI, respectively. The dominant theme that emerged was the importance of symbiosis between humans and AI (45 [94%]). Seeking biopsy was the most common response to conflict between human and AI clinical decision-making (32 [67%]). Overall, 36 patients (75%) would recommend AI to family members and friends.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      In this qualitative study, patients appeared to be receptive to the use of AI for skin cancer screening if implemented in a manner that preserves the integrity of the human physician-patient relationship."

            "abstract": "Patient satisfaction is an important indicator of health care quality, and it remains an important goal for optimal treatment outcomes to reduce the level of misdiagnoses and inappropriate or absent therapeutic actions. Digital support tools for differential diagnosis to assist clinicians in reaching the correct diagnosis may be helpful, but how the use of these affect patients is not clear. The primary objective of this feasibility study was to investigate patient experience and satisfaction in a primary care setting where general practitioners (GPs) used a visual clinical decision support system (CDSS) compared with standard consultations. Secondary objectives were diagnostic accuracy and length of consultation. Thirty-one patients with a dermatologist-confirmed skin diagnosis were allocated to consult GPs that had been randomized to conduct either standard consultations (SDR, n = 21) or CDSS (n = 16) on two separate study days one week apart. All patients were diagnosed independently by multiple GPs (n = 3-8) in both the SDR and CDSS study arms. Using the CDSS, more patients felt involved in the decision making (P = 0.05). In addition, more patients were exposed to images during the consultations (P = 6.8e-27), and 83% of those that were shown images replied they felt better supported in the consultation. The use of CDSS significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy (34%, P = 0.007), and did not increase the duration of the consultation (median 10 minutes in both arms). This study shows for the first time that compared with standard GP consultations, CDSS assist the GP on skin related diagnoses and improve patient satisfaction and diagnostic accuracy without impacting the duration of the consultations. This is likely to increase correct treatment choices, patient adherence, and overall result in better healthcare outcomes."

            "abstract": "Manual count of mitotic figures, which is determined in the tumor region with the highest mitotic activity, is a key parameter of most tumor grading schemes. It can be, however, strongly dependent on the area selection due to uneven mitotic figure distribution in the tumor section. We aimed to assess the question, how significantly the area selection could impact the mitotic count, which has a known high inter-rater disagreement. On a data set of 32 whole slide images of H&E-stained canine cutaneous mast cell tumor, fully annotated for mitotic figures, we asked eight veterinary pathologists (five board-certified, three in training) to select a field of interest for the mitotic count. To assess the potential difference on the mitotic count, we compared the mitotic count of the selected regions to the overall distribution on the slide. Additionally, we evaluated three deep learning-based methods for the assessment of highest mitotic density: In one approach, the model would directly try to predict the mitotic count for the presented image patches as a regression task. The second method aims at deriving a segmentation mask for mitotic figures, which is then used to obtain a mitotic density. Finally, we evaluated a two-stage object-detection pipeline based on state-of-the-art architectures to identify individual mitotic figures. We found that the predictions by all models were, on average, better than those of the experts. The two-stage object detector performed best and outperformed most of the human pathologists on the majority of tumor cases. The correlation between the predicted and the ground truth mitotic count was also best for this approach (0.963-0.979). Further, we found considerable differences in position selection between pathologists, which could partially explain the high variance that has been reported for the manual mitotic count. To achieve better inter-rater agreement, we propose to use a computer-based area selection for support of the pathologist in the manual mitotic count."

Design: Cross-sectional epidemiologic study analyzing the content of posts associated with 31 Instagram skin of color dermatology-related topics (hashtags). Setting: Population-based Participants: The Instagram accounts linked with the top 9 posts as generated by the Instagram algorithm associated with each search term. Exposures: Instagram account holders. Main Outcomes and Measures: [1] The number of posts associated with each skin of color dermatology hashtag search term. [2] Classification of posts as either educational or promotional. [3] Classification of posts as a photo or video. [4] Classification of Instagram accounts that produced the posts (American board-certified dermatologists, dermatology residents, foreign dermatologists, patients, medical interest groups, or other). [5] Quantification of the number of post likes and comments. [6] Comparison of number of educational and promotional posts between board-certified dermatologists and other Instagram users. Results: The 31 sampled hashtags were associated with a total of 9,087,589 posts as of January 16, 2020. 219 of the 288 top posts generated from these queries met inclusion criteria. Board-certified dermatologists (26 posts) only generated 12% of top posts, whereas individuals not certified in dermatology produced 88% of top content. Of this group, social media influencers were the largest subcategory (37 posts). A majority of the top posts were promotional (135 posts, 61.6%) and formatted as photos (181 posts, 82.6%). While there was a significant difference in the number of likes for content posted by board-certified dermatologists vs non-dermatologists (P=0.027), these differences became non-significant after stratifying by the intention of the post (promotional P=0.13, educational P=0.17). Conclusions and Relevance: Board-certified dermatologists are underrepresented among people generating top skin of color dermatology-related content on Instagram. Board-certified dermatologists should establish a more prominent presence on social media platforms so that patients have greater access to accurate, evidenced-based educational resources regarding dermatologic conditions, treatment options, and treatment risks from reliable sources.

We performed a retrospective multicentre study to evaluate dermoscopic images of histologically-proven LM and PAK, and assess previously described dermoscopic criteria. In the first part of the study, 61 cases of LM and 74 PAK were examined and a parsimonious algorithm was elaborated using stepwise discriminant analysis.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) are high-risk skin cancers which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early curable cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems use artificial intelligence to analyse lesion data and arrive at a diagnosis of skin cancer. When used in unreferred settings ('primary care'), CAD may assist general practitioners (GPs) or other clinicians to more appropriately triage high-risk lesions to secondary care. Used alongside clinical and dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, CAD may reduce unnecessary excisions without missing melanoma cases.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine the accuracy of CAD systems for diagnosing cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, BCC or cSCC in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of dermoscopy.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Studies of any design that evaluated CAD alone, or in comparison with dermoscopy, in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma or BCC or cSCC, and compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS-2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities separately by type of CAD system, using the bivariate hierarchical model. We compared CAD with dermoscopy using (a) all available CAD data (indirect comparisons), and (b) studies providing paired data for both tests (direct comparisons). We tested the contribution of human decision-making to the accuracy of CAD diagnoses in a sensitivity analysis by removing studies that gave CAD results to clinicians to guide diagnostic decision-making.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 42 studies, 24 evaluating digital dermoscopy-based CAD systems (Derm-CAD) in 23 study cohorts with 9602 lesions (1220 melanomas, at least 83 BCCs, 9 cSCCs), providing 32 datasets for Derm-CAD and seven for dermoscopy. Eighteen studies evaluated spectroscopy-based CAD (Spectro-CAD) in 16 study cohorts with 6336 lesions (934 melanomas, 163 BCC, 49 cSCCs), providing 32 datasets for Spectro-CAD and six for dermoscopy. These consisted of 15 studies using multispectral imaging (MSI), two studies using electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and one study using diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy. Studies were incompletely reported and at unclear to high risk of bias across all domains. Included studies inadequately address the review question, due to an abundance of low-quality studies, poor reporting, and recruitment of highly selected groups of participants.Across all CAD systems, we found considerable variation in the hardware and software technologies used, the types of classification algorithm employed, methods used to train the algorithms, and which lesion morphological features were extracted and analysed across all CAD systems, and even between studies evaluating CAD systems. Meta-analysis found CAD systems had high sensitivity for correct identification of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in highly selected populations, but with low and very variable specificity, particularly for Spectro-CAD systems. Pooled data from 22 studies estimated the sensitivity of Derm-CAD for the detection of melanoma as 90.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 84.0% to 94.0%) and specificity as 74.3% (95% CI 63.6% to 82.7%). Pooled data from eight studies estimated the sensitivity of multispectral imaging CAD (MSI-CAD) as 92.9% (95% CI 83.7% to 97.1%) and specificity as 43.6% (95% CI 24.8% to 64.5%). When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the mean observed melanoma prevalence of 20%, Derm-CAD would miss 20 melanomas and would lead to 206 false-positive results for melanoma. MSI-CAD would miss 14 melanomas and would lead to 451 false diagnoses for melanoma. Preliminary findings suggest CAD systems are at least as sensitive as assessment of dermoscopic images for the diagnosis of invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants. We are unable to make summary statements about the use of CAD in unreferred populations, or its accuracy in detecting keratinocyte cancers, or its use in any setting as a diagnostic aid, because of the paucity of studies.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In highly selected patient populations all CAD types demonstrate high sensitivity, and could prove useful as a back-up for specialist diagnosis to assist in minimising the risk of missing melanomas. However, the evidence base is currently too poor to understand whether CAD system outputs translate to different clinical decision-making in practice. Insufficient data are available on the use of CAD in community settings, or for the detection of keratinocyte cancers. The evidence base for individual systems is too limited to draw conclusions on which might be preferred for practice. Prospective comparative studies are required that evaluate the use of already evaluated CAD systems as diagnostic aids, by comparison to face-to-face dermoscopy, and in participant populations that are representative of those in which the test would be used in practice."

We present W-Net, a novel Convolution Neural Network (CNN) framework that employs the raw ultrasound waveforms in addition to the grey ultrasound image to semantically segment and label tissues for anatomical, pathological, or other diagnostic purposes. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first deep-learning or CNN approach for segmentation that analyzes ultrasound raw RF data along with the grey image. We chose subcutaneous tissue (SubQ) segmentation as our initial clinical goal for dense segmentation since it has diverse intermixed tissues, is challenging to segment, and is an underrepresented research area. SubQ potential applications include plastic surgery, adipose stem-cell harvesting, lymphatic monitoring, and possibly detection/treatment of certain types of tumors. Unlike prior work, we seek to label every pixel in the image, without the use of a background class. A custom dataset consisting of hand-labeled images by an expert clinician and trainees are used for the experimentation, currently labeled into the following categories: skin, fat, fat fascia/stroma, muscle, and muscle fascia. We compared W-Net and attention variant of W-Net (AW-Net) with U-Net and Attention U-Net (AU-Net). Our novel W-Net's RF-Waveform encoding architecture outperformed regular U-Net and AU-Net, achieving the best mIoU accuracy (averaged across all tissue classes). We study the impact of RF data on dense labeling of the SubQ region, which is followed by the analyses of the generalization capability of the networks to patients and analysis on the SubQ tissue classes, determining that fascia tissues, especially muscle fascia in particular, are the most difficult anatomic class to recognize for both humans and AI algorithms. We present diagnostic semantic segmentation, which is semantic segmentation carried out for the purposes of direct diagnostic pixel labeling, and apply it to breast tumor detection task on a publicly available dataset to segment pixels into malignant tumor, benign tumor, and background tissue class. Using the segmented image we diagnose the patient by classifying the breast lesion as either benign or malignant.

Melanoma diagnosis is difficult, even for experienced dermatologists, due to the wide range of morphologies in skin lesions. Given the rapid development of deep learning algorithms for melanoma diagnosis, it is crucial to validate and benchmark these models, which is the main challenge of this work. This research presents a new benchmarking and selection approach based on the multi-criteria analysis method (MCDM), which integrates entropy and the preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE) methods. The experimental study is carried out in four phases. Firstly, 19 convolution neural networks (CNNs) are trained and evaluated on a public dataset of 991 dermoscopic images. Secondly, to obtain the decision matrix, 10 criteria, including accuracy, classification error, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, false-positive rate, false-negative rate, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and the number of parameters are established. Third, entropy and PROMETHEE methods are integrated to determine the weights of criteria and rank the models. Fourth, the proposed benchmarking framework is validated using the VIKOR method. The obtained results reveal that the ResNet101 model is selected as the optimal diagnosis model for melanoma in our case study data. Thus, the presented benchmarking framework is proven to be useful at exposing the optimal melanoma diagnosis model targeting to ease the selection process of the proper convolutional neural network architecture."

Hence, this paper intends to develop an efficient skin cancer detection scheme, which classifies the nature of cancer, whether it is normal, benign or malignant.

Moreover, the extracted features are subjected to fuzzy classifier for recognizing the cancer. In addition, the limits of membership functions are optimally selected by improved Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). Thus, the proposed scheme is termed as Improved Selection of Encircling and Spiral updating position of WO-based Fuzzy Classifier (ISESW-FC). From the optimized output, the type of skin cancer image can be determined, whether it is normal, benign or malignant. The performance of proposed model is compared over other conventional methods, and its efficiency is proved by means of Type I and Type II measures."

(2) Methods: The predictions are made by k-nearest neighbor with a 5-fold cross validation algorithm and a neural network model to assist dermatologists in the diagnosis of cancerous skin lesions. As a main contribution, this work proposes a descriptor that combines skin surface fractal dimension and relevant color area features for skin lesion classification purposes. The surface fractal dimension is computed using a 2D generalization of Higuchi's method. A clustering method allows for the selection of the relevant color distribution in skin lesion images by determining the average percentage of color areas within the nevi and melanoma lesion areas. In a classification stage, the Higuchi fractal dimensions (HFDs) and the color features are classified, separately, using a kNN-CV algorithm. In addition, these features are prototypes for a Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) classifier. The efficiency of our algorithms was verified by utilizing images belonging to the 7-Point, Med-Node, and PH2 databases; (3) Results: Experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed RBFNN model in skin cancer classification is 95.42% for 7-Point, 94.71% for Med-Node, and 94.88% for PH2, which are all significantly better than that of the kNN algorithm.

For high degree malignant skin tumors, if not detected in time, they can do serious harm to patients' health. However, in clinical practice, identifying malignant degree requires biopsy and pathological examination which is time costly. Furthermore, in many areas, due to the severe shortage of dermatologists, it's inconvenient for patients to go to hospital for examination. Therefore, an easy to access screening method of malignant skin tumors is needed urgently. Firstly, we spend 5 years to build a dataset which includes 4,500 images of 10 kinds of skin tumors. All instances are verified pathologically thus trustworthy; Secondly, we label each instance to be either low-risk, high-risk or dangerous in which Junctional nevus, Intradermal nevus, Dermatofibroma, Lipoma and Seborrheic keratosis are low-risk, Basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease and Actinic keratosis are high-risk, Squamous cell carcinoma and Malignant melanoma are dangerous; Thirdly, we apply the Xception architecture to build the risk degree classifier.

            "abstract": "Early detection of melanoma remains a daily challenge due to the increasing number of cases and the lack of dermatologists. Thus, AI-assisted diagnosis is considered as a possible solution for this issue. Despite the great advances brought by deep learning and especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are still not used in clinical practice. This may be explained by the dermatologist's fear of being misled by a false negative and the assimilation of CNNs to a \"black box\", making their decision process difficult to understand by a non-expert. Decision theory, especially game theory, is a potential solution as it focuses on identifying the best decision option that maximizes the decision-maker's expected utility. This study presents a new framework for automated melanoma diagnosis. Pursuing the goal of improving the performance of existing systems, our approach also attempts to bring more transparency in the decision process. The proposed framework includes a multi-class CNN and six binary CNNs assimilated to players. The players' strategies is to first cluster the pigmented lesions (melanoma, nevus, and benign keratosis), using the introduced method of evaluating the confidence of the predictions, into confidence level (confident, medium, uncertain). Then, a subset of players has the strategy to refine the diagnosis for difficult lesions with medium and uncertain prediction. We used EfficientNetB5 as the backbone of our networks and evaluated our approach on the public ISIC dataset consisting of 8917 lesions: melanoma (1113), nevi (6705) and benign keratosis (1099). The proposed framework achieved an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.93 for melanoma, 0.96 for nevus and 0.97 for benign keratosis. Furthermore, our approach outperformed existing methods in this task, improving the balanced accuracy (BACC) of the best compared method from 77% to 86%. These results suggest that our framework provides an effective and explainable decision-making strategy. This approach could help dermatologists in their clinical practice for patients with atypical and difficult-to-diagnose pigmented lesions. We also believe that our system could serve as a didactic tool for less experienced dermatologists."

Methods: First, the weighted co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm was used to identify the hub genes related to clinical phenotypes of melanoma in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database. Nest, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis was used to dimensionality reduction of these hub genes and constructed a prognostic signature to predict the prognosis and immunosuppressive response of melanoma. Result: Through in-depth analysis, we constructed a 5-mRNA prognostic signature and verified its prognostic value in internal (TCGA-SKCM, n = 452) and external independent datasets (GSE53118, n = 79). Based on this signature, the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) of melanoma was characterized, and the result was found that patients in the high-risk group had lower CD8 T cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression (PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA4), as well as higher M0/M2 macrophage infiltration. Our results also found the risk score based on a 5-mRNA signature was significantly associated with tumor mutational burden (TMB) and tumor stem cell markers (CD20, CD38, ABCB5, CD44, etc.). Lastly, we built a nomogram for clinician prediction for the prognosis of patients with melanoma. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that the 5-mRNA signature has an important predictive value for the overall survival of melanoma.

To effectively discriminate benign and malign skin lesions, this work investigates sixty different architectures of the Feedforward Back Propagation Network (FFBPN), based on shape asymmetry for an optimal structural design that includes both the hidden neuron number and the input data selection. The reason for the choice of shape asymmetry was based on the 5-10% disagreement between dermatologists regarding the efficacy of asymmetry in the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. Asymmetry is quantified based on lesion shape (contour), moment of inertia of the lesion shape and histograms. The FFBPN has a high architecture flexibility, which indicates it as a favorable tool to avoid the over-parameterization of the ANN and, equally, to discard those redundant input datasets that usually result in poor test performance. The FFBPN was tested on four public image datasets containing melanoma, dysplastic nevus and nevus images. Experimental results on multiple benchmark data sets demonstrate that asymmetry A2 is a meaningful feature for skin lesion classification, and FFBPN with 16 neurons in the hidden layer can model the data without compromising prediction accuracy."

In the reader study, for the multi-class tasks, the diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of 164 dermatologists were 0.770 and 0.962 for BCC, 0.807 and 0.897 for melanocytic nevus, 0.624 and 0.976 for seborrheic keratosis, 0.939 and 0.875 for the \"others\" group, respectively; the diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of multi-class CNN were 0.800 and 1.000 for BCC, 0.800 and 0.840 for melanocytic nevus, 0.850 and 0.940 for seborrheic keratosis, 0.750 and 0.940 for the \"others\" group, respectively. For the two-class tasks, the sensitivity and specificity of dermatologists and CNN for classifying psoriasis were 0.872 and 0.838, 1.000 and 0.605, respectively. Both the dermatologists and CNN achieved at least moderate consistency with the reference standard, and there was no significant difference in Kappa coefficients between them (P > 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The performance of CNN developed with relatively modest number of dermoscopic images of skin tumors and psoriasis for Chinese population is comparable with 164 dermatologists.

            "abstract": "As an analytic tool in medicine, deep learning has gained great attention and opened new ways for disease diagnosis. Recent studies validate the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms for binary classification of skin lesions (i.e., melanomas and nevi classes) with dermoscopic images. Nonetheless, those binary classification methods cannot be applied to the general clinical situation of skin cancer screening in which multi-class classification must be taken into account. The main objective of this research is to develop, implement, and calibrate an advanced deep learning model in the context of automated multi-class classification of skin lesions. The proposed Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model is carefully designed with several layers, and multiple filter sizes, but fewer filters and parameters to improve efficacy and performance. Dermoscopic images are acquired from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration databases (ISIC-17, ISIC-18, and ISIC-19) for experiments. The experimental results of the proposed DCNN approach are presented in terms of precision, sensitivity, specificity, and other metrics. Specifically, it attains 94 % precision, 93 % sensitivity, and 91 % specificity in ISIC-17. It is demonstrated by the experimental results that this proposed DCNN approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, exhibiting 0.964 area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) in ISIC-17 for the classification of skin lesions and can be used to assist dermatologists in classifying skin lesions. As a result, this proposed approach provides a novel and feasible way for automating and expediting the skin lesion classification task as well as saving effort, time, and human life."

Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made significant and rapid advances within dermatology image analysis. The aims of this investigation were to create a de novo CNN for differentiating between MIS and invasive melanomas based on clinical close-up images and to compare its performance on a test set to seven dermatologists. Methods: A retrospective study including clinical images of MIS and invasive melanomas obtained from our department during a five-year time period (2016-2020) was conducted. Overall, 1,551 images [819 MIS (52.8%) and 732 invasive melanomas (47.2%)] were available. The images were randomized into three groups: training set (n = 1,051), validation set (n = 200), and test set (n = 300). A de novo CNN model with seven convolutional layers and a single dense layer was developed. Results: The area under the curve was 0.72 for the CNN (95% CI 0.66-0.78) and 0.81 for dermatologists (95% CI 0.76-0.86) (P < 0.001). The CNN correctly classified 208 out of 300 lesions (69.3%) whereas the corresponding number for dermatologists was 216 (72.0%). When comparing the CNN performance to each individual reader, three dermatologists significantly outperformed the CNN. Conclusions: For this classification problem, the CNN was outperformed by the dermatologist. However, since the algorithm was only trained and validated on 1,251 images, future refinement and development could make it useful for dermatologists in a real-world setting."

Therefore, there is a clear need for an affordable and effective adjunct modality that can address these limitations.

            "abstract": "Medical image analysis for perfect diagnosis of disease has become a very challenging task. Due to improper diagnosis, required medical treatment may be skipped. Proper diagnosis is needed as suspected lesions could be missed by the physician's eye. Hence, this problem can be settled up by better means with the investigation of similar case studies present in the healthcare database. In this context, this paper substantiates an assistive system that would help dermatologists for accurate identification of 23 different kinds of melanoma. For this, 2300 dermoscopic images were used to train the skin-melanoma similar image search system. The proposed system uses feature extraction by assigning dynamic weights to the low-level features based on the individual characteristics of the searched images. Optimal weights are obtained by the newly proposed optimized pair-wise comparison (OPWC) approach. The uniqueness of the proposed approach is that it provides the dynamic weights to the features of the searched image instead of applying static weights. The proposed approach is supported by analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and meta-heuristic optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), JAYA, genetic algorithm (GA), and gray wolf optimization (GWO). The proposed approach has been tested with images of 23 classes of melanoma and achieved significant precision and recall. Thus, this approach of skin melanoma image search can be used as an expert assistive system to help dermatologists/physicians for accurate identification of different types of melanomas."

            "abstract": "Background and Objective. Skin cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. One of the most common non-melanoma tumors is basal cell carcinoma (BCC), which accounts for 75% of all skin cancers. There are many benign lesions that can be confused with these types of cancers, leading to unnecessary biopsies. In this paper, a new method to identify the different BCC dermoscopic patterns present in a skin lesion is presented. In addition, this information is applied to classify skin lesions into BCC and non-BCC. Methods. The proposed method combines the information provided by the original dermoscopic image, introduced in a convolutional neural network (CNN), with deep and handcrafted features extracted from color and texture analysis of the image. This color analysis is performed by transforming the image into a uniform color space and into a color appearance model. To demonstrate the validity of the method, a comparison between the classification obtained employing exclusively a CNN with the original image as input and the classification with additional color and texture features is presented. Furthermore, an exhaustive comparison of classification employing different color and texture measures derived from different color spaces is presented. Results. Results show that the classifier with additional color and texture features outperforms a CNN whose input is only the original image. Another important achievement is that a new color cooccurrence matrix, proposed in this paper, improves the results obtained with other texture measures. Finally, sensitivity of 0.99, specificity of 0.94 and accuracy of 0.97 are achieved when lesions are classified into BCC or non-BCC. Conclusions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a methodology to detect all the possible patterns that can be present in a BCC lesion is proposed. This detection leads to a clinically explainable classification into BCC and non-BCC lesions. In this sense, the classification of the proposed tool is based on the detection of the dermoscopic features that dermatologists employ for their diagnosis."

Accurate identification of erythema migrans allows for early diagnosis and treatment, which avoids the potential for later neurologic, rheumatologic, and cardiac complications of Lyme disease. We develop and test several deep learning models for detecting erythema migrans versus several other clinically relevant skin conditions, including cellulitis, tinea corporis, herpes zoster, erythema multiforme, lesions due to tick bites and insect bites, as well as non-pathogenic normal skin. We consider a set of clinically-relevant binary and multiclass classification problems of increasing complexity. We train the DL models on a combination of publicly available images and test on public images as well as images obtained in the clinical setting. We report performance metrics that measure agreement with a gold standard, as well as a receiver operating characteristic curve and associated area under the curve. On public images, we find that the DL system has an accuracy ranging from 71.58% (and 95% error margin equal to 3.77%) for an 8-class problem of EM versus 7 other classes including other skin pathologies, insect bites and normal skin, to 94.23% (3.66%) for a binary problem of EM vs. non-pathological skin. On clinical images of affected individuals, the DL system has a sensitivity of 88.55% (2.39%).

Bacterial culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it has low sensitivity and takes days to produce definitive results. Early laboratory diagnosis can help guide physicians to provide treatment specific to B. pseudomallei In our study, we adapted host gene expression signatures obtained from microarray data of B. pseudomallei-infected cases to develop a real-time PCR diagnostic test using two differentially expressed genes, AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) and FAM26F (family with sequence similarity 26, member F). We tested blood from 33 patients with B. pseudomallei infections and 29 patients with other bacterial infections to validate the test and determine cutoff values for use in a cascading diagnostic algorithm. Differentiation of septicemic melioidosis from other sepsis cases had a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 93%, and negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV) of 82% and 93%, respectively. Separation of cases likely to be melioidosis from those unlikely to be melioidosis in nonbacteremic situations showed a sensitivity of 40%, specificity of 54%, and NPV and PPV of 44% and 50%, respectively.

Hence, there is a great need for a new automated approach in order to make diagnosis more reliable. In this paper, we present a twophase technique to classify images of lesions into benign or malignant. The first phase consists of an image processing-based method that extracts the Asymmetry, Border Irregularity, Color Variation and Diameter of a given mole.

Diagnosis of pigmented lesions is challenging even for experienced dermatologists due to the wide range of morphological manifestations.

The main problem of implementing intellectual analysis systems is low accuracy. One of the possible ways to increase this indicator is using stages of preliminary processing of visual data and the use of heterogeneous data.

Additionally, dermoscopic images were classified by a CNN approved for the European market as a medical device (Moleanalyzer Pro, FotoFinder Systems, Bad Birnbach, Germany). Primary endpoints were the sensitivity and specificity of the CNN's dichotomous classification in comparison with the dermatologists' management decisions.

            "abstract": "Background and objective:\n        \n      \n      Dermatological images are typically diagnosed based on visual analysis of the skin lesion acquired using a dermoscope. However, the final quality of the acquired image is highly dependent on the illumination conditions during the acquisition phase. This variability in the light source can affect the dermatologist's diagnosis and decrease the accuracy of computer-aided diagnosis systems. Color constancy algorithms have proven to be a powerful tool to address this issue by allowing the standardization of the image illumination source, but the most commonly used algorithms still present some inherent limitations due to assumptions made on the original image. In this work, we propose a novel Dermatological Color Constancy Generative Adversarial Network (DermoCC-GAN) algorithm to overcome the current limitations by formulating the color constancy task as an image-to-image translation problem.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A generative adversarial network was trained with a custom heuristic algorithm that performs well on the training set. The model hence learns the domain transfer task (from original to color standardized image) and is then able to accurately apply the color constancy on test images characterized by different illumination conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art color constancy algorithms for dermatological images in terms of normalized median intensity and when using the color-normalized images in a deep learning framework for lesion classification (accuracy of the seven-class classifier: 79.2%) and segmentation (dice score: 90.9%). In addition, we validated the proposed approach on two different external datasets with highly satisfactory results.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The novel strategy presented here shows how it is possible to generalize a heuristic method for color constancy for dermatological image analysis by training a GAN.

In addition, the accuracies of these features in differentiating melanoma from benign lesions were compared. Results show that simple features based on the brightness difference between the two halves of the lesion performed the best in predicting asymmetry and subsequently melanoma.Clinical relevance- The proposed work will assist researchers in choosing better performing color asymmetry features thereby improving the accuracy of automatic melanoma detection.

Currently, disease severity scores require dermatologists to estimate percentage area of involvement, which is subjected to inter and intra-assessor variability. Previous studies focus on pure skin but vitiligo on the face, which has a more serious impact on patients' quality of life, was completely neglected. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have good performance on many segmentation tasks. However, due to data privacy, it is hard to have a large clinical vitiligo face image dataset to train a CNN. To address this challenge, images from two different sources, the Internet and the proposed vitiligo face synthesis algorithm, are employed in training. 843 vitiligo images taken from different viewpoints were collected from the Internet. These images are hugely different from the target clinical images collected according to a newly established international standard. To have more vitiligo face images similar to the target clinical images to enhance segmentation performance, an image synthesis algorithm is proposed. Both synthetic and Internet images are used to train a CNN which is modified from the fully convolutional network (FCN) to segment face vitiligo lesions. The results show that 1) the synthetic images effectively improve segmentation performance; 2) the proposed algorithm achieves 1.06 % error for the face vitiligo area estimation and 3) it is more accurate than two dermatologists and all the previous automated vitiligo segmentation methods, which were designed for segmentation vitiligo on pure skin."

Grading acne plays an important role in diagnosis, and the diagnosis is made by counting the number of acne. It is a labor-intensive job and it is easy for dermatologists to make mistakes, so it is very important to develop automatic diagnosis methods.

            "abstract": "Melanoma will affect an estimated 73,000 new cases this year and result in 9,000 deaths, yet precise diagnosis remains a serious problem. Without early detection and preventative care, melanoma can quickly spread to become fatal (Stage IV 5-year survival rate is 20-10%) from a once localized skin lesion (Stage IA 5- year survival rate is 97%). There is no biomarker for melanoma in clinical use, and the current diagnostic criteria for skin lesions remains subjective and imprecise. Accurate diagnosis of melanoma relies on a histopathologic gold standard; thus, aggressive excision of melanocytic skin lesions has been the mainstay of treatment. It is estimated that 36 biopsies are performed for every melanoma confirmed by pathology among excised lesions. There is significant morbidity in misdiagnosing melanoma such as progression of the disease for a false negative prediction vs the risks of unnecessary surgery for a false positive prediction. Every year, poor diagnostic precision adds an estimated $673 million in overall cost to manage the disease. Currently, manual dermatoscopic imaging is the standard of care in selecting atypical skin lesions for biopsy, and at best it achieves 90% sensitivity but only 59% specificity when performed by an expert dermatologist. Many computer vision (CV) algorithms perform better than dermatologists in classifying skin lesions although not significantly so in clinical practice. Meanwhile, open source deep learning (DL) techniques in CV have been gaining dominance since 2012 for image classification, and today DL can outperform humans in classifying millions of digital images with less than 5% error rates. Moreover, DL algorithms are readily run on commoditized hardware and have a strong online community of developers supporting their rapid adoption. In this work, we performed a successful pilot study to show proof of concept to DL skin pathology from images. However, DL algorithms must be trained on very large labelled datasets of images to achieve high accuracy. Here, we begin to assemble a large imageset of skin lesions from the UCSF and the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) dermatology clinics that are well characterized by their underlying pathology, on which to train DL algorithms. If trained on sufficient data, we hypothesize that our approach will significantly outperform general dermatologists in predicting skin lesion pathology. We posit that our work will allow for precision diagnosis of melanoma from widely available digital photography, which may optimize the management of the disease by decreasing unnecessary office visits and the significant morbidity and cost of melanoma misdiagnosis."

We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of an open-access AI application (Skin Image Search™) for recognition of skin diseases. Clinical images including tumours, infective and inflammatory skin diseases were collected at the Department of Dermatology at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital and uploaded for classification by the online application. The AI algorithm classified the images giving 5 differential diagnoses, which were then compared to the diagnoses made clinically by the dermatologists and/or histologically. We included 521 images portraying 26 diagnoses. The diagnostic accuracy was 56.4% for the top 5 suggested diagnoses and 22.8% when only considering the most probable diagnosis. The level of diagnostic accuracy varied considerably for diagnostic groups. The online application demonstrated low diagnostic accuracy compared to a dermatologist evaluation and needs further development."

            "abstract": "General practitioners (GPs) are playing a key role in skin cancer screening. Non-melanoma skin cancer is frequent and difficult to diagnose. We aimed to assess whether GPs are facing difficulties in diagnosing non-pigmented skin tumours (NPSTs) and whether they would be interested in artificial intelligence (AI) software that could help them with this task. A questionnaire addressing the difficulties in diagnosing NPST and the potential interest in AI as a tool to help diagnose these tumours was emailed to GPs working in two French regions. In total, 147 respondents (98%) had faced difficulties diagnosing NPSTs; 86% agreed that an AI diagnostic tool could be useful in a GP's office and 83% agreed that it could change their practice. Nevertheless, 68% would not be willing to pay for this kind of software. GPs are facing difficulties in diagnosing NPSTs and would be interested in an AI tool that could help them achieve this. As referral to dermatology practices can be trying, AI diagnostic aids should be developed to help GPs in their gatekeeping task, however at limited cost to the GP."

However, in psoriasis, BSA tends to be overestimated by physicians and has shown high inter-rater and intrarater variability. Furthermore, there are no reports suggesting the cause and clinical significance of overestimating BSA in psoriasiss.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      To investigate the errors in estimating BSA in psoriasis by comparing physicians' results with those of computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA) and to provide suggestions regarding the clinical implications of such errors.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using 43 images, 36 physicians visually estimated BSA in psoriasis, and subsequently, the images were evaluated using a CAIA program (ImageJ); the BSA values determined by the physicians and CAIA were then compared and matched. The BSA percentage was also graded on a scale from 0 to 6, as follows: Grade 0 = no lesion, Grade 1 = 1%-9%, Grade 2 = 10%-29%, Grade 3 = 30%-49%, Grade 4 = 50%-69%, Grade 5 = 70%-89% and Grade 6 = 90%-100%.

Physicians tended to overestimate the BSA of psoriatic lesions by 8.76% ± 8.82% compared with CAIA. The largest estimation error (proportion incorrect 75.7%) was observed in Grade 3 (30%-49% involvement). Estimates in the second half of the range demonstrated a higher proportion of inaccuracies compared with those in the first half. An overestimating error occurred in certain morphological characteristics of the psoriatic lesions.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The inaccuracy of BSA estimation by physicians may be related to the fact that information from the human eye is perceived to be exaggerated compared with the actual size. Further research into using artificial intelligence technology is needed to reduce quantification error and develop an ideal BSA assessment system. Additionally, education and training are needed for physicians to measure BSA accurately."

Furthermore, the image digitalization provides an opportunity to develop algorithms for automatic quantifications, ideally leading to improved reproducibility as compared to the naked eye examination by pathologists. In order to implement them effectively, accuracy of mitotic figure detection using WSI should be investigated.

Studies show significant improvement in skin cancer detection with dermoscopy use. Frontline FMPs are an ideal target group for dermoscopy training. The 3-step Triage Amalgamated Dermoscopic Algorithm (TADA) facilitates high sensitivity and specificity for pigmented and nonpigmented skin lesions. Step I requires unequivocal identification of dermoscopic features for 1 of 3 benign skin lesions: angioma, dermatofibroma, or seborrheic keratosis.

Many traditional machine learning algorithms including deep learning-based methods are employed for melanoma classification. However, more and more complex network architectures do not harvest a leap in model performance. In this paper, we aim to enhance the credibility of CAD approach for melanoma by paying more attention to clinically important information. We propose a Zoom-in Attention and Metadata Embedding (ZooME) melanoma detection network by: 1) introducing a Zoom-in Attention model to better extract and utilize unique pathological information of dermoscopy images; 2) embedding patients' demographic information including age, gender, and anatomic body site, to provide well-rounded information for better prediction. We apply a ten-fold cross-validation on the latest ISIC-2020 dataset with 33,126 dermoscopy images. The proposed ZooME achieved state-of-the-art results with 92.23% in AUC score, 84.59% in accuracy, 85.95% in sensitivity, and 84.63% in specialty, respectively."

Usually physicians look for abnormalities in these modalities in diagnostic procedures. Count and volume of abnormalities are very important for optimal treatment of patients. Segmentation is a preliminary step for these measurements and also further analysis. Manual segmentation of abnormalities is cumbersome, error prone, and subjective. As a result, automated segmentation of abnormal tissue is a need. In this study, representative techniques for segmentation of abnormal tissues are reviewed. Main focus is on the segmentation of multiple sclerosis lesions, breast cancer masses, lung nodules, and skin lesions. As experimental results demonstrate, the methods based on deep learning techniques perform better than other methods that are usually based on handy feature engineering techniques. Finally, the most common measures to evaluate automated abnormal tissue segmentation methods are reported."

While diversification may result in more generalizable AI-based systems, it can also introduce hidden variables. If neural networks are able to distinguish/learn hidden variables, these variables can introduce batch effects that compromise the accuracy of classification systems.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The objective of the study was to analyze the learnability of an exemplary selection of hidden variables (patient age, slide preparation date, slide origin, and scanner type) that are commonly found in whole slide image data sets in digital pathology and could create batch effects.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We trained four separate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn four variables using a data set of digitized whole slide melanoma images from five different institutes.

For example, variation in image brightness or different cameras can already suffice to diminish performance. Ensemble solutions, where multiple model predictions are combined into one, can improve these problems.

Based on this preliminary screening, the physician decides whether to proceed with further tests, typically prostate biopsy, to confirm cancer and evaluate its aggressiveness. Nevertheless, the specificity of the PSA test is suboptimal and, as a result, about 75% of men who undergo a prostate biopsy do not have cancer even if they have elevated PSA levels. Overdiagnosis leads to unnecessary overtreatment of prostate cancer with undesirable side effects, such as incontinence, erectile dysfunction, infections, and pain. Here, we used artificial neuronal networks to develop models that can diagnose PC efficiently. The model receives as an input a panel of 4 clinical variables (total PSA, free PSA, p2PSA, and PSA density) plus age. The output of the model is an estimate of the Gleason score of the patient. After training on a dataset of 190 samples and optimization of the variables, the model achieved values of sensitivity as high as 86% and 89% specificity. The efficiency of the method can be improved even further by training the model on larger datasets."

Each set included 30 melanomas and 100 benign lesions of related localisations and morphology (set-SSM: superficial spreading melanomas and macular nevi; set-LMM: lentigo maligna melanomas and facial solar lentigines/seborrhoeic keratoses/nevi; set-NM: nodular melanomas and papillomatous/dermal/blue nevi; set-Mucosa: mucosal melanomas and mucosal melanoses/macules/nevi; set-AMskin: acrolentiginous melanomas and acral (congenital) nevi; set-AMnail: subungual melanomas and subungual (congenital) nevi/lentigines/ethnical type pigmentations).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The CNN showed a high-level performance in set-SSM, set-NM and set-LMM (sensitivities >93.3%, specificities >65%, receiver operating characteristics-area under the curve [ROC-AUC] >0.926). In set-AMskin, the sensitivity was lower (83.3%) at a high specificity (91.0%) and ROC-AUC (0.928). A limited performance was found in set-mucosa (sensitivity 93.3%, specificity 38.0%, ROC-AUC 0.754) and set-AMnail (sensitivity 53.3%, specificity 68.0%, ROC-AUC 0.621).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The CNN may help to partly counterbalance reduced human accuracies. However, physicians need to be aware of the CNN's limited diagnostic performance in mucosal and subungual lesions. Improvements may be expected from additional training images of mucosal and subungual sites."

As of yet, no clinical guidelines, diagnostic criteria, or treatment algorithms exist, and the approaches to the diagnostic workup and treatment of UV patients may differ globally. We conducted an online survey to examine how UV patients are diagnosed and treated by international specialists and to reveal the greatest challenges in managing UV patients worldwide.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Distribution of the questionnaire included an email to individuals in the World Allergy Organization (WAO) database, with no restrictions applied to the specialty, affiliation, or nationality of the participants (November 2018). The email contained a link (Internet address) to the online questionnaire. Responses were anonymous. The link to the questionnaire was further sent to the network of Urticaria Centers of Reference and Excellence (UCARE) in the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA2LEN) as well as to the Turkish Dermatology Society and the Japanese Society of Allergology, who distributed the link to their members. In addition, the survey link was posted online in the group of the Russian Society of Allergologists and Immunologists.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We received 883 completed surveys from physicians in 92 countries. UV was reported to be rare in clinical practice, with an average of 5 patients per physician per year. More than two-thirds of physicians reported wheals, burning of the skin, and residual hyperpigmentation in 60-100% of UV patients. The most frequently reported reason for receiving referrals of patients with UV was to establish the diagnosis. The most important features for establishing the diagnosis of UV were wheals of longer than 24 hours duration (72%), the results of skin biopsy (63%), and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (46%). The most common tests ordered in UV patients were complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, complement components, antinuclear antibodies, and skin biopsy. Physicians considered UV to be of unknown cause in most patients, and drugs and systemic lupus erythematosus to be the most common identifiable causes. Two of 3 physicians reported that they use second-generation antihistamines in standard dose as the first-line therapy in patients with UV. The greatest perceived challenges in the management of UV were the limited efficacy of drugs and the absence of clinical guidelines and treatment algorithms.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      UV is a challenging disease. Skin biopsy, a gold standard for UV diagnosis, is not performed by many physicians. This may lead to misdiagnosis of UV, for example, as chronic spontaneous urticaria, and to inadequate treatment. International consensus-based recommendations for the classification of UV and the diagnostic workup and treatment, as well as prospective studies evaluating potentially safe and effective drugs for the treatment of UV, are necessary."

            "abstract": "The rates of skin cancer (SC) are rising every year and becoming a critical health issue worldwide. SC's early and accurate diagnosis is the key procedure to reduce these rates and improve survivability. However, the manual diagnosis is exhausting, complicated, expensive, prone to diagnostic error, and highly dependent on the dermatologist's experience and abilities. Thus, there is a vital need to create automated dermatologist tools that are capable of accurately classifying SC subclasses. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have verified the success of computer-assisted dermatologist tools in the automatic diagnosis and detection of SC diseases. Previous AI-based dermatologist tools are based on features which are either high-level features based on DL methods or low-level features based on handcrafted operations. Most of them were constructed for binary classification of SC. This study proposes an intelligent dermatologist tool to accurately diagnose multiple skin lesions automatically. This tool incorporates manifold radiomics features categories involving high-level features such as ResNet-50, DenseNet-201, and DarkNet-53 and low-level features including discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and local binary pattern (LBP). The results of the proposed intelligent tool prove that merging manifold features of different categories has a high influence on the classification accuracy. Moreover, these results are superior to those obtained by other related AI-based dermatologist tools. Therefore, the proposed intelligent tool can be used by dermatologists to help them in the accurate diagnosis of the SC subcategory. It can also overcome manual diagnosis limitations, reduce the rates of infection, and enhance survival rates."

In this prospective study, we investigated the diagnostic accuracy of a class 1 CE-certified smartphone app in melanoma risk stratification and its patient and dermatologist satisfaction. Pigmented skin lesions ≥ 3 mm and any suspicious smaller lesions were assessed by the smartphone app SkinVision® (SkinVision® B.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands, App-Version 6.8.1), 2D FotoFinder ATBM® master (FotoFinder ATBM® Systems GmbH, Bad Birnbach, Germany, Version 3.3.1.0), 3D Vectra® WB360 (Canfield Scientific, Parsippany, NJ, USA, Version 4.7.1) total body photography (TBP) devices, and dermatologists. The high-risk score of the smartphone app was compared with the two gold standards: histological diagnosis, or if not available, the combination of dermatologists', 2D and 3D risk assessments. A total of 1204 lesions among 114 patients (mean age 59 years; 51% females (55 patients at high-risk for developing a melanoma, 59 melanoma patients)) were included.

Additionally, all patients and dermatologists completed a newly created questionnaire for preference and trust of screening type. The smartphone app was rated as trustworthy by 36% (20/55) of patients at high-risk for melanoma, 49% (29/59) of melanoma patients, and 8.8% (10/114) of dermatologists.

A skin cancer screening by combination of dermatologist and smartphone app was favored by only 1.8% (1/55) resp. 3.4% (2/59) of the patients; no patient preferred an assessment by a smartphone app alone. The diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice was not as reliable as previously advertised and the satisfaction with smartphone apps for melanoma risk stratification was scarce. MHealth apps might be a potential medium to increase awareness for melanoma screening in the lay population, but healthcare professionals and users should be alerted to the potential harm of over-detection and poor performance.

            "abstract": "In this paper, we describe our method for skin lesion classification. The goal is to classify skin lesions based on dermoscopic images to several diagnoses' classes presented in the HAM (Human Against Machine) dataset: melanoma (MEL), melanocytic nevus (NV), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), actinic keratosis (AK), benign keratosis (BKL), dermatofibroma (DF), and vascular lesion (VASC). We propose a simplified solution which has a better accuracy than previous methods, but only predicted on a single model that is practical for a real-world scenario. Our results show that using a network with additional metadata as input achieves a better classification performance. This metadata includes both the patient information and the extra information during the data augmentation process. On the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC) 2018 skin lesion classification challenge test set, our algorithm yields a balanced multiclass accuracy of 88.7% on a single model and 89.5% for the embedding solution, which makes it the currently first ranked algorithm on the live leaderboard. To improve the inference accuracy. Test time augmentation (TTA) is applied. We also demonstrate how Grad-CAM is applied in TTA. Therefore, TTA and Grad-CAM can be integrated in heat map generation, which can be very helpful to assist the clinician for diagnosis."

In this paper, we present a semi-supervised computer-aided system for automatic erythema severity scoring in psoriasis images. Firstly, the unsupervised stage includes a novel image representation method. We construct a dictionary, which is then used in the sparse representation for local feature extraction. To acquire the final image representation vector, an aggregation method is exploited over the local features. Secondly, the supervised phase is where various multi-class machine learning (ML) classifiers are trained for erythema severity scoring. Finally, we compare the proposed system with two popular unsupervised feature extractor methods, namely: bag of visual words model (BoVWs) and AlexNet pretrained model. Root mean square error (RMSE) and F1 score are used as performance measures for the learned dictionaries and the trained ML models, respectively. A psoriasis image set consisting of 676 images, is used in this study. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of the proposed procedure can provide a setup where erythema scoring is accurate and consistent. Also, it is revealed that dictionaries with large number of atoms and small patch sizes yield the best representative erythema severity features. Further, random forest (RF) outperforms other classifiers with F1 score 0.71, followed by support vector machine (SVM) and boosting with 0.66 and 0.64 scores, respectively.

Introduction: Our first aim was to evaluate the frequency of use of different electronic devices, that is, personal computer (PC), notebook, tablet, smartphone, in a pool of dermatologists recruited to perform multiple online testing session on difficult melanocytic skin lesions (MSLs) cases. The second aim was to evaluate the feasibility of each device in terms of teledermatologic diagnostic performance; the use of four different diagnostic methods, that is, intuitive diagnosis and three dermoscopic algorithms, was also investigated. Materials and Methods: A total of 111 dermatologists with 4 different levels of experience in dermoscopy, performed 4 tests (intuitive diagnosis and iDScore, ABCD rule, 7-point-checklist-based diagnosis) on 979 MSLs blinded cases. Each testing session was performed with a preferred device. Results: The overall highest areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) (82%) was obtained by young generation dermoscopists 1-4 years experience) when using an integrated clinical dermoscopic algorithm (iDScore) on a notebook. The average dermatologist using the iDScore obtained AUROC 77.40% with large screen devices (PC and notebook) 77.6% with small screen (tablet, smartphone) and 78.2% by combining the two. Discussion: Young generation of dermoscopists alternately use different devices, whereas elderly generation still prefer to use the PC. The diagnostic performances obtained with small/large screen were not statistically different from those obtained with fixed/mobile devices. Conclusions: Mobile devices were feasible tools to achieve adequate diagnostic accuracy in difficult MSLs, on a teledermatology setting, independently from participant skill level/age."

The anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 antibody ipilimumab and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibodies, including nivolumab and pembrolizumab, are currently available and widely used, and other immune-inhibiting antibodies are now under intensive investigation. These antibodies have shown efficacy in a growing number of tumor types, following initial observations of their notable effects in melanoma treatment. Despite the efficacy of these antibodies, their novel mechanisms of action are also associated with a new class of side effects called immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). These side effects do not share a common pathophysiology with other anticancer treatments and, therefore, they often require specific therapies. When detected early and correctly treated, IRAEs are reversible; however, they can become severe and life-threatening if underestimated or inappropriately treated. This review aims to revisit the pathogenesis of IRAEs, with attention to gastrointestinal manifestations, since these are common and potentially dangerous complications of immunotherapy and represent a major cause of treatment discontinuation. Recommendations and guidelines for the management of IRAEs are also presented, in order to provide a clear and applicable algorithm for use by clinicians."

This is required for a broad range of indispensable intelligent applications, like intelligent healthcare systems. Dynamic image classification is one of the major areas of concern for researchers, which may take place during analysis under the IoT environment. Dynamic image classification is associated with several temporal data perturbations (such as novel class arrival and class evolution issue) which cause a massive classification deterioration in the deployed classification models and make them in-effective. Therefore, this study addresses such temporal inconsistencies (novel class arrival and class evolution issue) and proposes an adapted deep learning framework (ameliorated adaptive convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble framework), which handles novel class arrival and class evaluation issue during dynamic image classification. The proposed framework is an improved version of previous adaptive CNN ensemble with an additional online training (OT) and online classifier update (OCU) modules. An OT module is a clustering-based approach which uses the Euclidean distance and silhouette method to determine the potential new classes, whereas, the OCU updates the weights of the existing instances of the ensemble with newly arrived samples. The proposed framework showed the desirable classification improvement under non-stationary scenarios for the benchmark (CIFAR10) and real (ISIC 2019: Skin disease) data streams. Also, the proposed framework outperformed against state-of-art shallow learning and deep learning models. The results have shown the effectiveness and proven the diversity of the proposed framework to adapt the new concept changes during dynamic image classification. In future work, the authors of this study aim to develop an IoT-enabled adaptive intelligent dermoscopy device (for dermatologists).

Despite being common, its identification is tremendously hard because of the complexities like skin tone and color variation due to the presence of hair regions. Therefore the type of skin disease prediction is not accurately achieved in many pieces of research. To deal with mentioned concerns, a novel optimal probability-based deep neural network is proposed to assist medical professionals in appropriately diagnosing the type of skin disease. Initially, the input dataset is fed into the pre-processing stage, which helps to remove unwanted contents in the image. Afterward, features extracted for all the pre-processed images are subjected to the proposed Optimal Probability-Based Deep Neural Network (OP-DNN) for the training process. This classification algorithm classifies incoming clinical images as different skin diseases with the help of probability values. While learning OP-DNN, it is essential to determine the optimal weight values for reducing the training error. For optimizing weight in OP-DNN structure, an optimization approach is implemented in this research. For that, whale optimization is utilized because it works faster than other methods. The proposed multi-type skin disease prediction model is implemented in MatLab software and achieved 95% of accuracy, 0.97 of specificity, and 0.91 of sensitivity. This exposes the superiority of the proposed multi-type skin disease prediction model using an effective OP-DNN based feature extraction approach to attain a high accuracy rate and also it predict several kinds of skin disease than the previous models, which can protect the patients survives as well as can assist the physicians in making a decision certainly."

To perform diagnostic analysis, clinicians collect a set of RCM mosaics (RCM images concatenated in a raster fashion to extend the field view) at 4-5 specific layers in skin, all localized in the junction between the epidermal and dermal layers (dermal-epidermal junction, DEJ), necessitating locating that junction before mosaic acquisition. In this study, we automate DEJ localization using deep recurrent convolutional neural networks to delineate skin strata in stacks of RCM images collected at consecutive depths. Success will guide to automated and quantitative mosaic acquisition thus reducing inter operator variability and bring standardization in imaging.

A miniature dataset version of it is also available with only two classes: malignant and benign. Malignant tumors are tumors that are cancerous, and benign tumors are non-cancerous. Malignant tumors have the ability to multiply and spread throughout the body at a much faster rate. The early detection of the cancerous skin lesion is crucial for the survival of the patient. Deep learning models and machine learning models play an essential role in the detection of skin lesions. Still, due to image occlusions and imbalanced datasets, the accuracies have been compromised so far. In this paper, we introduce an interpretable method for the non-invasive diagnosis of melanoma skin cancer using deep learning and ensemble stacking of machine learning models. The dataset used to train the classifier models contains balanced images of benign and malignant skin moles. Hand-crafted features are used to train the base models (logistic regression, SVM, random forest, KNN, and gradient boosting machine) of machine learning. The prediction of these base models was used to train level one model stacking using cross-validation on the training set. Deep learning models (MobileNet, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, and DenseNet121) were used for transfer learning, and were already pre-trained on ImageNet data. The classifier was evaluated for each model. The deep learning models were then ensembled with different combinations of models and assessed. Furthermore, shapely adaptive explanations are used to construct an interpretability approach that generates heatmaps to identify the parts of an image that are most suggestive of the illness. This allows dermatologists to understand the results of our model in a way that makes sense to them. For evaluation, we calculated the accuracy, F1-score, Cohen's kappa, confusion matrix, and ROC curves and identified the best model for classifying skin lesions."

To overcome these challenges, color enhancement and automatic color identification techniques, based on QuadTree segmentation and modeled after expert color assessments, are developed. The approach presented in this paper is shown to provide an accurate model of expert color assessment. Specifically, the proposed model is shown to: 1) identify significantly more colors in melanomas than in benign skin lesions; 2) identify a higher frequency in melanomas of three colors: blue-gray, black, and pink; and 3) delineate locations of melanoma colors by quintiles, specifically predilection for blue-gray and pink in the periphery and a trend for white and black in the lesion center.

The opacity of black box algorithms is an obstacle to the trustworthiness of their outcomes. Moreover, the use of opaque algorithms is not normatively justified in medical practice. The authors introduce a formalism, called computational reliabilism, which allows generating justified beliefs on the algorithm reliability and trustworthy outcomes of artificial intelligence (AI) systems by means of epistemic warrants, called reliability indicators. However, they remark the need for reliability indicators specific to black box algorithms and that justified knowledge is not sufficient to justify normatively the actions of the physicians using medical AI systems. Therefore, Durán and Jongsma advocate for a more transparent design and implementation of black box algorithms, providing a series of recommendations to mitigate the epistemic and ethical challenges behind their use in medical practice. In this response, I argue that a peculiar form of black box algorithm transparency, called design publicity, may efficiently implement these recommendations. Design publicity encodes epistemic, that is, reliability indicators, and ethical recommendations for black box algorithms by means of four subtypes of transparency. These target the values and goals, their translation into design requirements, the performance and consistency of the algorithm altogether.

First, clinical photographs are annotated by dermatologists, and then the original background information is masked with unique colors to generate several subsets with distinct background colors. Sample-balanced training and test sets are generated using random over/undersampling and data augmentation techniques. Finally, the deep learning networks are independently trained on diverse subsets of backdrop colors to compare the performance of classifiers based on different background information.

In addition, ML models are increasingly being applied to dermatology as a diagnostic decision support tool using image analysis, especially for skin cancer detection and classification.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aims to perform a prospective validation of an image analysis ML model as a diagnostic decision support tool for the diagnosis of dermatological conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this prospective study, 100 consecutive patients who visit a participant general practitioner (GP) with a skin problem in central Catalonia were recruited. Data collection was planned to last 7 months. Anonymized pictures of skin diseases were taken and introduced to the ML model interface (capable of screening for 44 different skin diseases), which returned the top 5 diagnoses by probability. The same image was also sent as a teledermatology consultation following the current stablished workflow. The GP, ML model, and dermatologist's assessments will be compared to calculate the precision, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the ML model. The results will be represented globally and individually for each skin disease class using a confusion matrix and one-versus-all methodology. The time taken to make the diagnosis will also be taken into consideration.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patient recruitment began in June 2021 and lasted for 5 months. Currently, all patients have been recruited and the images have been shown to the GPs and dermatologists. The analysis of the results has already started.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study will provide information about ML models' effectiveness and limitations. External testing is essential for regulating these diagnostic systems to deploy ML models in a primary care practice setting."

            "title": "Management of dupilumab-associated ocular surface diseases in atopic dermatitis patients.",
            "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterised by eczematous skin lesions and intense pruritus. It is often associated with other atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, bronchial asthma and eosinophilic oesophagitis. Dupilumab is the first biologic approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in Switzerland. Dupilumab targets the interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13 receptor and thus inhibits the signalling of IL-4 and IL-13, two key mediators of type 2 inflammation, resulting in an improvement of clinical signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. Patients with atopic dermatitis present more often with ocular surface diseases (OSDs), such as allergic conjunctivitis, blepharitis and keratitis as well as infectious conjunctivitis and keratoconus compared with the general population. Upon dupilumab therapy, increased rates of ocular surface diseases have been reported in clinical trials. Interestingly, dupilumab-associated (da) OSD is restricted to atopic dermatitis patients and has not been observed in asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis trials. Fortunately, most cases of dupilumab-associated OSD are mild-to-moderate and transient. Thus, ocular surface disease presents a particular adverse event of treatment with dupilumab in dermatology. This article aims at providing a practical guide for physicians, with a special focus on dermatologists, allergists and ophthalmologists in Switzerland, to the diagnosis and management of dupilumab-associated OSD in atopic dermatitis patients.For this purpose, an expert group of dermatologists and ophthalmologists from university and cantonal hospitals in Switzerland reviewed data on ocular surface diseases published in clinical trial and real-life reports of dupilumab therapy, published case reports and case series on the management of dupilumab-associated OSD, as well as recent recommendations provided by experts of national and international boards. Based on the observations of dupilumab-associated OSD and practical experiences in identifying and treating OSD, an algorithm has been developed that is specific to the needs in Switzerland. Considering concomitant ocular diseases and differential diagnoses, the clinical presentation of dupilumab-associated OSD and its response to therapeutic measures, a stepwise approach is recommended. Mild dupilumab-associated OSD can be managed by dermatologists and allergists, whereas patients with moderate-to-severe OSD requiring corticosteroid or calcineurin inhibitor therapy should necessarily be referred to an ophthalmologist. The effects of preventive measures, such as artificial tears, are uncertain. The recommendations provided here should guarantee a prompt and effective treatment of OSD for patients under dupilumab therapy in order to prevent that an otherwise potent therapy has to be ceased because of ocular adverse events."

The association of gentian violet skin markings in dermoscopic images with the performance of the CNN was investigated in 3 image sets of 130 melanocytic lesions each (107 benign nevi, 23 melanomas).\n    \n\n\n          Exposures:\n        \n      \n      The same lesions were sequentially imaged with and without the application of a gentian violet surgical skin marker and then evaluated by the CNN for their probability of being a melanoma. In addition, the markings were removed by manually cropping the dermoscopic images to focus on the melanocytic lesion.\n    \n\n\n          Main outcomes and measures:\n        \n      \n      Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the CNN's diagnostic classification in unmarked, marked, and cropped images.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In all, 130 melanocytic lesions (107 benign nevi and 23 melanomas) were imaged.

In marked lesions, an increase in melanoma probability scores was observed that resulted in a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 85.7%-100%) and a significantly reduced specificity of 45.8% (95% CI, 36.7%-55.2%, P < .001). The ROC AUC was 0.922. Cropping images led to the highest sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 85.7%-100%), specificity of 97.2% (95% CI, 92.1%-99.0%), and ROC AUC of 0.993.

Less is known about their robustness against real-world variations, and clinicians may incorrectly assume that a model with an acceptable area under the receiver operating characteristic curve or related performance metric is ready for clinical use. Here, we systematically assessed the performance of dermatologist-level convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on real-world non-curated images by applying computational \"stress tests\". Our goal was to create a proxy environment in which to comprehensively test the generalizability of off-the-shelf CNNs developed without training or evaluation protocols specific to individual clinics. We found inconsistent predictions on images captured repeatedly in the same setting or subjected to simple transformations (e.g., rotation). Such transformations resulted in false positive or negative predictions for 6.5-22% of skin lesions across test datasets. Our findings indicate that models meeting conventionally reported metrics need further validation with computational stress tests to assess clinic readiness."

            "abstract": "The early detection of melanoma is the most efficient way to reduce its mortality rate. Dermatologists achieve this task with the help of dermoscopy, a non-invasive tool allowing the visualization of patterns of skin lesions. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems developed on dermoscopic images are needed to assist dermatologists. These systems rely mainly on multiclass classification approaches. However, the multiclass classification of skin lesions by an automated system remains a challenging task. Decomposing a multiclass problem into a binary problem can reduce the complexity of the initial problem and increase the overall performance. This paper proposes a CAD system to classify dermoscopic images into three diagnosis classes: melanoma, nevi, and seborrheic keratosis. We introduce a novel ensemble scheme of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), inspired by decomposition and ensemble methods, to improve the performance of the CAD system. Unlike conventional ensemble methods, we use a directed acyclic graph to aggregate binary CNNs for the melanoma detection task. On the ISIC 2018 public dataset, our method achieves the best balanced accuracy (76.6%) among multiclass CNNs, an ensemble of multiclass CNNs with classical aggregation methods, and other related works. Our results reveal that the directed acyclic graph is a meaningful approach to develop a reliable and robust automated diagnosis system for the multiclass classification of dermoscopic images."

            "abstract": "Lesion segmentation is a critical task in skin cancer analysis and detection. When developing deep learning-based segmentation methods, we need a large number of human-annotated labels to serve as ground truth for model-supervised learning. Due to the complexity of dermatological images and the subjective differences of different dermatologists in decision-making, the labels in the segmentation target boundary region are prone to produce uncertain labels or error labels. These labels may lead to unsatisfactory performance of dermoscopy segmentation. In addition, the model trained by the errored one-hot label may be overconfident, which can lead to arbitrary prediction and model overfitting. In this paper, a superpixel-oriented label distribution learning method is proposed. The superpixels formed by the simple linear iterative cluster (SLIC) algorithm combine one-hot labels constraint and define a distance function to convert it into a soft probability distribution. Referring to the model structure of knowledge distillation, after Superpixel-oriented label distribution learning, we get soft labels with structural prior information. Then the soft labels are transferred as new knowledge to the lesion segmentation network for training. Ours method on ISIC 2018 datasets achieves an Dice coefficient reaching 84%, sensitivity 79.6%, precision 80.4%, improved by 19.3%, 8.6% and 2.5% respectively in comparison with the results of U-Net.

In recent years, the interpretability of deep networks has been explored using methods that obtain visual features highlighted by neurones or analyse activations to extract more useful information. Following the latter approach, this study proposes a system for melanoma diagnosis that explicitly incorporates dermoscopic feature segmentations into a diagnosis network through a channel modulation scheme. Modulation weights control the influence of the detected visual patterns based on the lesion content. As shown in the experimental section, our design not only improves the system performance on the ISIC 2016 (average AUC of 86.6% vs. 85.8%) and 2017 (average AUC of 94.0% vs. 93.8%) datasets, but also notably enhances the interpretability of the diagnosis, providing useful and intuitive cues to clinicians."

            "title": "Using deep learning for dermatologist-level detection of suspicious pigmented skin lesions from wide-field images.",
            "abstract": "A reported 96,480 people were diagnosed with melanoma in the United States in 2019, leading to 7230 reported deaths. Early-stage identification of suspicious pigmented lesions (SPLs) in primary care settings can lead to improved melanoma prognosis and a possible 20-fold reduction in treatment cost. Despite this clinical and economic value, efficient tools for SPL detection are mostly absent. To bridge this gap, we developed an SPL analysis system for wide-field images using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and applied it to a 38,283 dermatological dataset collected from 133 patients and publicly available images. These images were obtained from a variety of consumer-grade cameras (15,244 nondermoscopy) and classified by three board-certified dermatologists. Our system achieved more than 90.3% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 90 to 90.6) and 89.9% specificity (89.6 to 90.2%) in distinguishing SPLs from nonsuspicious lesions, skin, and complex backgrounds, avoiding the need for cumbersome individual lesion imaging. We also present a new method to extract intrapatient lesion saliency (ugly duckling criteria) on the basis of DCNN features from detected lesions. This saliency ranking was validated against three board-certified dermatologists using a set of 135 individual wide-field images from 68 dermatological patients not included in the DCNN training set, exhibiting 82.96% (67.88 to 88.26%) agreement with at least one of the top three lesions in the dermatological consensus ranking. This method could allow for rapid and accurate assessments of pigmented lesion suspiciousness within a primary care visit and could enable improved patient triaging, utilization of resources, and earlier treatment of melanoma."

            "abstract": "Skin lesions are a feature of many diseases including cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Ulcerative lesions are a common manifestation of CL. Response to treatment in such lesions is judged through the assessment of the healing process by regular clinical observations, which remains a challenge for the clinician, health system, and the patient in leishmaniasis endemic countries. In this study, image processing was initially done using 40 CL lesion color images that were captured using a mobile phone camera, to establish a technique to extract features from the image which could be related to the clinical status of the lesion. The identified techniques were further developed, and ten ulcer images were analyzed to detect the extent of inflammatory response and/or signs of healing using pattern recognition of inflammatory tissue captured in the image. The images were preprocessed at the outset, and the quality was improved using the CIE L∗a∗b color space technique. Furthermore, features were extracted using the principal component analysis and profiled using the signal spectrogram technique. This study has established an adaptive thresholding technique ranging between 35 and 200 to profile the skin lesion images using signal spectrogram plotted using Signal Analyzer in MATLAB. The outcome indicates its potential utility in visualizing and assessing inflammatory tissue response in a CL ulcer. This approach is expected to be developed further to a mHealth-based prediction algorithm to enable remote monitoring of treatment response of cutaneous leishmaniasis."

However, the segmentation is challenging due to the low contrast of skin lesions from a captured image, fuzzy and indistinct lesion boundaries, huge variety of interclass variation of melanomas, the existence of artifacts, etc. In this work, an efficient and accurate melanoma region segmentation method is proposed for computer-aided diagnostic systems.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A skin lesion segmentation (SLS) method based on the separable-Unet with stochastic weight averaging is proposed in this work. Specifically, the proposed Separable-Unet framework takes advantage of the separable convolutional block and U-Net architectures, which can extremely capture the context feature channel correlation and higher semantic feature information to enhance the pixel-level discriminative representation capability of fully convolutional networks (FCN). Further, considering that the over-fitting is a local optimum (or sub-optimum) problem, a scheme based on stochastic weight averaging is introduced, which can obtain much broader optimum and better generalization.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The proposed method is evaluated in three publicly available datasets. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach segmented the skin lesions with an average Dice coefficient of 93.03% and Jaccard index of 89.25% for the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2016 Skin Lesion Challenge (SLC) dataset, 86.93% and 79.26% for the ISIC 2017 SLC, and 94.13% and 89.40% for the PH2 dataset, respectively. The proposed approach is compared with other state-of-the-art methods, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms them for SLS on both melanoma and non-melanoma cases. Segmentation of a potential lesion with the proposed approach in a dermoscopy image requires less than 0.05 s of processing time, which is roughly 30 times faster than the second best method (regarding the value of Jaccard index) for the ISIC 2017 dataset with the same hardware configuration.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We concluded that using the separable convolutional block and U-Net architectures with stochastic weight averaging strategy could enable to obtain better pixel-level discriminative representation capability. Moreover, the considerably decreased computation time suggests that the proposed approach has potential for practical computer-aided diagnose systems, besides provides a segmentation for the specific analysis with improved segmentation performance."

            "abstract": "The dermatoscope has gained tremendous popularity among dermatologists as an adjunctive tool to better visualize subsurface structures and identify patterns that may improve the diagnosis of a wide range of skin diseases. Initially, the pigmented lesion experts who were the early adopters promoted the use of the dermatoscope to increase diagnostic accuracy of early melanomas and decrease the harvesting of benign lesions. With current near universal adoption of the diagnostic technique by dermatologists, the dermatoscope is now employed to help identify a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious, and vascular conditions of the skin, hair, and nails, resulting in the emergence of several branches of dermatoscopy-inflammoscopy, trichoscopy, onychoscopy, and entodermoscopy. The future of dermatoscopy will involve incorporation of artificial intelligence that will make the assessment process increasingly objective, more accurate, and universally available. Despite the wide acceptance and adoption of dermatoscopy, the overall impact of its widespread use still remains unclear, whether it has decreased biopsy rates of benign lesions, reduced health care costs, or improved patient outcomes."

They will not only evaluate the single lesion of interest but more importantly the context of it. Visually comparing the similarity of the majority of lesions within the same patient provides a strong indication for lesions with significantly differing aspects. Deep learning algorithms are capable to identify such outliers, i.e. images that differ considerably from the expected appearance on a larger cohort, and highlight the main differences in those cases.

Clinical Relevance- Deep learning algorithms are showing many promising results in dermatology lesion classification. However the context of the lesion is normally not considered in the analysis which prevents these tools to transition into routine practice. An outlier detector based on real world data would allow a dermatologist or general practitioner to detect the suspicious lesions for further examination. The algorithm would additionally provide useful insights by highlighting the feature differences between the original outlier (malignant lesion) and the lesion reconstructed by the autoencoder."
