            "criteria": "We searched four electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore (IEE Xplore) and Scopus for peer-reviewed articles of AI-assisted skin cancer diagnosis without language restriction from January 1, 2017, until November 8, 2022. Search terms were combined for four key concepts: (1) AI, (2) skin cancer, (3) diagnosis, (4) doctors. The full search strategy is available in the Supplementary material (Supplementary Table 3). We chose 2017 as the cutoff for this review since this was the year when deep learning was first reported as performing at a level comparable to dermatologists, notably in the seminal study by Esteva et al9, which suggested that AI technology had reached a clinically useful level in assisting skin cancer diagnosis.",
