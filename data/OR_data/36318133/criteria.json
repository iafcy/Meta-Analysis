            "criteria": "Investigators independently dual reviewed abstracts and full-text articles to identify studies meeting prespecified eligibility criteria. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus. Published studies were eligible for the meta-analysis if they evaluated associations of unintended pregnancy with maternal and infant health outcomes occurring during pregnancy and post partum by comparing participants with unintended vs intended pregnancies and reported estimates that adjusted for confounders. Unintended pregnancy was determined by maternal self-report. To optimize applicability to US practice, eligible studies included populations in countries considered very high on the 2018 Human Development Index. While the search and eligibility criteria used an inclusive definition of women (ie, pregnant and postpartum populations that included all gender identities), studies referred to their populations as women. Investigators managed references in an EndNote database (Thomson Reuters).",
