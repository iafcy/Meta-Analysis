Pregnancy Intention and Its Relationship to 
Birth and Maternal Outcomes 

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether there are associations 
between pregnancy intention (intended, unwanted, mis- 
timed, or ambivalent) and negative birth and maternal 
outcomes: low birth weight (less than 2,500 g), preterm 
delivery (fewer than 37 weeks), small for gestational age, 
premature labor, hypertension, and other maternal out- 
comes. 
METHODS: We analyzed data from the population-based 
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, including 
87,087 women who gave birth between 1996 and 1999 in 18 
states. Information on pregnancy outcomes was derived 
from birth certificate data and a self-administered question- 
naire completed postpartum. We employed SUDAAN (RTI 
International, Research Triangle Park, NC) for univariable 
and logistical regression analyses. 
RESULTS: In analyses controlling for demographic and 
behavioral factors, women with unwanted pregnancies had 
an increased likelihood of preterm delivery (adjusted odds 
ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.33) and 
premature rupture of membranes (adjusted OR 1.37, 95% 
CI 1.01–1.85) compared with women with intended preg- 
nancies. Women who were ambivalent toward their preg- 
nancies had increased odds of delivering a low birth weight 
infant (adjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02–1.29); in contrast, 
women with mistimed pregnancies had a lower likelihood 
(adjusted OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 – 0.97).

CONCLUSION: Pregnancy intention, 
specifically un- 
wanted and ambivalent, may be an indicator of increased 
risk for some poor birth and maternal outcomes and 
should be considered in interventions aimed at improv- 
ing the health of the mother and child. 
(Obstet Gynecol 2007;109:678–86) 


nancies in 2001 were unintended.1 An unin- 
tended pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy that is 
either unwanted or mistimed at the time of concep- 
tion.2,3 Current definitions of unintended preg- 
nancy also include women who are ambivalent 
about their pregnancy.4 Unintended pregnancy is 
associated with social and economic disadvantage 
and maternal behaviors such as smoking, alcohol 
consumption, and late initiation of prenatal care.5– 8 
Poor birth outcomes such as preterm delivery and 
low birth weight are prevalent in the United States; 
preterm delivery and low birth weight rates in 2002 
were 12.1% and 7.8%, respectively, with the low 
birth weight rate reaching the highest level reported 
in three decades.9 Although several studies have 
examined the associations between pregnancy in- 
tention and birth outcomes, such as low birth 
weight, preterm delivery, and small for gestational 
age, the findings are inconsistent mainly due to 
small sample size and lack of adjustment for strong 
confounders.10 –18 
Although globally and in the United States, safe- 
motherhood initiatives have drawn attention to the 
prevalence of maternal mortality and morbidity, pop- 
ulation-based data and research examining factors 
associated with maternal morbidity are lacking. A 
handful of studies have documented associations be- 
tween pregnancy intention and other outcomes, such 
as depression, physical abuse, and postpartum depres- 
sion,19 –21 but research focused specifically on the 
relationship between unintended pregnancy and ma- 
ternal outcomes is limited. 




the 
effect of pregnancy intention on birth and maternal 
outcomes, this analysis aimed to examine the associ- 
ation between pregnancy intention (intended, un- 
wanted, mistimed, or ambivalent) and birth outcomes 
(low birth weight, preterm delivery, and small for 
gestational age) or maternal outcomes (nausea, kidney 
or bladder infections, premature rupture of mem- 
branes, vaginal bleeding, diabetes, high blood pres- 
sure, premature labor, pregnancy complications, and 
hospitalizations during pregnancy). If such an associ- 
ation does exist, pregnancy intention may be an 
additional factor that clinicians can use to identify 
potential risk of poor pregnancy outcomes. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
We used data from the ongoing, population-based 
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System,22,23 
including 87,087 women who gave birth between 
1996 and 1999 in 18 states, where survey response 
rates were 70% or more. In each state, every month, 
women who give birth are randomly chosen and sent 
a self-administered questionnaire 2 to 6 months post- 
partum. Women who fail to respond to the question- 
naire after two attempts are offered a telephone 
interview. Because the Pregnancy Risk Assessment 
Monitoring System uses a stratified sampling process 
that oversamples women with specific risks and char- 
acteristics (eg, race), weights are created for this 
oversampling scheme. Weights are also created for 
nonresponse by examining factors that influence re- 
sponse (eg, maternal age). The data are statistically 
weighted to adjust for survey design, noncoverage, 
and nonresponse, thereby creating a study population 
that is representative of all female state residents who 
had a live birth in the state during 1996 and 1999. The 
self-administered questionnaire includes information 
about maternal behaviors and experiences before and 
during pregnancy. Data from the questionnaire are 
linked to the birth certificate. Women whose pregnan- 
cies ended in multiple births were excluded from this 
analysis. The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring 
System has been reviewed and approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. 
Pregnancy intention was the main exposure of 
interest and was assessed by the question, “Thinking 
back to just before you got pregnant, how did you feel 
about becoming pregnant?” Women who responded, 
“I wanted to be pregnant sooner” or “I wanted to be 
pregnant then” were categorized as intending the 
pregnancy. Women who reported “I wanted to be 
pregnant later” were labeled as having a mistimed 
pregnancy. Women who responded “I didn’t want to 
be pregnant then or at any time in the future” were 
classified as having an unwanted pregnancy. Ambiv- 
alence was defined as women who answered “I don’t 
know.” 
Data on birth outcomes came from birth certifi- 
cates and included low birth weight (less than 2,500 
g), preterm delivery (fewer than 37 weeks) and small 
for gestational age (defined as birth weight below the 
10th percentile for the infant’s gestational age based 
on race and parity—specific standards only available 
for white and African-American infants).24 The meth- 
odology described by Whitehead et al25 was used for 
determining the small for gestational age variable and 
for excluding incompatible infant birth weights and 
gestational ages. Odds ratios were calculated for 
maternal morbidities based on data from the birth 
certificate, the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitor- 
ing System questionnaire, or a combination of both 
data sources. The birth certificate provides only yes- 
or-no information regarding whether women had 
hypertension, vaginal bleeding, diabetes, premature 
rupture of the membranes, premature labor, or no 
complications at the time of the delivery. For the 
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System ques- 
tionnaire, women were asked if they had been hospi- 
talized during their pregnancy. Women who an- 
swered yes were then asked to select the reason why 
they were hospitalized (premature labor, high blood 
pressure, vaginal bleeding or placenta problems, nau- 
sea, vomiting, dehydration, kidney or bladder infec- 
tion, diabetes [high blood sugar], or other). While 
some women were hospitalized for these conditions 
during pregnancy, we do not know whether the 
condition (eg, diabetes) existed before the pregnancy. 
We combined the data for vaginal bleeding, diabetes, 
and high blood pressure because they were available 
from both the birth certificate and the Pregnancy Risk 
Assessment Monitoring System questionnaire. We 
also created three composite measures of maternal 
outcome based on whether any maternal outcome 
was reported only on the birth certificate, reported 
only in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring 
System, or reported on either the birth certificate or in 
the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. 
We employed SUDAAN (RTI International) for 
univariable and logistical regression analyses of our 
dependent variables: birth outcomes and maternal 
morbidities. For analytic purposes, we chose an a 
priori confounder set based upon the current litera- 
ture on pregnancy intention and birth outcomes. We 
used the same confounder set for all analyses, because 
no one to our knowledge has studied the association 




between pregnancy intention and maternal outcomes. 
The logistic regression models included maternal age, 
maternal race, maternal ethnicity, maternal educa- 
tion, marital status, parity, prenatal care, previous low 
birth weight infant or premature delivery, smoking 
during the pregnancy, and drinking during the preg- 
nancy as confounders. Given that we do not know the 
true causal mechanism, we viewed these variables as 
confounders. 
RESULTS 
In this population, 53.2% of women reported in- 
tended pregnancies, 10.6% had unwanted pregnan- 
cies, 30.2% had mistimed pregnancies, and 6.0% were 
their pregnancies from 1996 to 
ambivalent about 
1999 (Table 1). For poor birth outcomes, 5.9% of the 
women had a low birth weight infant, 8.7% had a 
preterm delivery, and 8.2% had a small for gestational 
age infant (data not shown). The prevalence of poor 
maternal outcomes was low overall but varied by type 
of outcome; 3.8% of the women in the sample had 
nausea, 2.2% had kidney or bladder infections, 2.5% 
had premature rupture of membranes, 4.1% had 
vaginal bleeding, 3.2% had diabetes, 6.4% had high 
blood pressure, and 6.3% had premature labor (data 
not shown). Based on birth certificate data, 11.3% had 
one of the maternal outcomes and for the Pregnancy 
Risk Assessment Monitoring System questionnaire, 
13.0% of women were hospitalized for one of the 
outcomes (data not shown). When combining the 
birth certificate and the Pregnancy Risk Assessment 
Monitoring System questionnaire data, 21.9% of 
women had at least one of the maternal outcomes 
(data not shown). 
Women who had unintended (combining un- 
wanted, mistimed, and ambivalent) pregnancies dif- 
fered from women with intended pregnancies in 
nearly all of the maternal characteristics and behav- 
iors, birth outcomes, and maternal outcomes (Table 
1). The distribution of birth and maternal outcomes 
varied by levels of pregnancy intention, with women 
who had an unwanted pregnancy differing signifi- 
cantly from those who had an intended pregnancy on 
a number of birth and maternal outcomes; however, 
fewer differences were observed among women who 
had mistimed pregnancies or who were ambivalent 
about their pregnancies (Table 1). 
In adjusted analyses (Table 2), women who re- 
ported that they felt ambivalent toward their pregnan- 
cies were more likely to have a low birth weight infant 
than women with intended pregnancies (adjusted OR 
1.15, 95% CI 1.02–1.29). Women with unwanted 
pregnancies were at increased odds of preterm deliv- 
ery (adjusted OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01–1.33) and pre- 
mature rupture of membranes (adjusted OR 1.37, 
95% CI 1.01–1.85). Women who had mistimed preg- 
nancies were at decreased odds of having a low birth 
weight infant (adjusted OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 – 0.97). 
No other associations were observed between preg- 
nancy intention and birth and maternal outcomes, 
including the composite variable of maternal out- 
comes from both Pregnancy Risk Assessment Moni- 
toring System and birth certificate data. 
DISCUSSION 
Unintended pregnancy was highly prevalent in this 
sample; nearly 50% of women reported an unin- 
tended pregnancy. Prevalence of low birth weight in 
our sample was similar to the national prevalence in 
1999 (the time of this study); 5.9% of women in our 
sample had a low birth weight infant compared with 
6.0% of women delivering singletons nationally. Pre- 
term rates were lower in our study: 8.7% in our 
sample compared with 11.8% (includes multiple 
births) nationally.26 
We found that women who reported that their 
pregnancies were unwanted had higher odds of pre- 
term delivery, which is consistent with other stud- 
ies.12,16 Women who reported they were ambivalent 
about their pregnancies had higher odds of delivering 
a low birth weight infant. However, women with 
mistimed pregnancies were at decreased odds of 
having a low birth weight infant, which is not consis- 
tent with other studies.17,21,27 Overall, we found no 
associations between pregnancy intention and mater- 
nal outcomes, except 
for an association between 
unwanted pregnancy and premature rupture of mem- 
branes. Although these associations were statistically 
significant, they may be of limited clinical significance 
due to their relatively weak magnitude. In addition, it 
is unclear whether pregnancy intention itself is a risk 
factor for poor outcomes or whether it is simply a risk 
marker for other variables that influence pregnancy 
outcome, such as late initiation of prenatal care or 
smoking or drinking during pregnancy.5,6,8,21,28 
Previous studies have focused primarily on “un- 
wanted” and “mistimed” pregnancies and have failed 
to include women who were ambivalent about their 
pregnancies16,17,27; however, in this analysis women 
who were ambivalent about 
their pregnancy had 
different risks for poor birth outcomes. We defined 
ambivalence as women who responded “I don’t 
know” to the question asking how they felt about the 
timing of their pregnancy, but this does not capture 
clearly the complex contradictory emotions that 
women may have toward pregnancy. Ambivalence is

not a very well-understood construct and does not

field of unintended pregnancy have argued the need 
to understand and assess ambivalence.29 –31 Our anal- 
ysis suggests that disaggregating those women who 
are ambivalent from the overall group of women with 
unwanted pregnancies may highlight a group of 
women who have unique characteristics and risks.

One of the main limitations in this study is the 
retrospective assessment of pregnancy intention at the 
time of conception. Several studies have shown that 
women underreport unintended pregnancy when 
asked about intention retrospectively, eg, a woman 
may state that she did not intend to become pregnant 
at the time of conception but then change her inten- 
tion status after giving birth.32–34 Women’s recall of 
pregnancy intention at the time of conception may be 
influenced by experiences during pregnancy, deliv- 
ery, and the postpartum period. Using data from the 
National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, an analysis of 
pregnancy intention during and after pregnancy has 
shown that switching of intention does occur when 
this 
women are asked retrospectively; however 
switching occurs in both directions: from unintended 
to intended and intended to unintended. The authors 
concluded that even with this switching, there is not 
an underestimate or overestimate of the number of 
unintended pregnancies or potential consequences of 
unintendedness, including very low birth weight.33 
Two studies that examined pregnancy intention pro- 
spectively found that women who had unwanted 
pregnancies were at a higher risk of premature labor, 
which is consistent with our results.12,16 
Misclassification of ambivalence may also be a 
limitation. Women who responded to the mailed 
questionnaire could read the all the response options 
for the pregnancy intention question; women who 
failed to answer the mailed questionnaire, but re- 
sponded to the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitor- 
ing System questionnaire by phone, were not explic- 
itly given the option “I don’t know.” In this case, only 
if a woman specifically stated that she did not know 
was she labeled as being ambivalent. In these data, 
18% of participants responded by phone. Women 
participating by phone were less likely to respond “I 
don’t know” than women participating by mail 
(P(cid:1).001). This may indicate misclassification of am- 
bivalence; however, when we excluded women from 
our analysis who responded by phone, the estimates 
for ambivalence did not change substantially. 
Another limitation may be an underestimation of 
maternal morbidity based on the information from 
birth certificate data and the Pregnancy Risk Assess- 
ment Monitoring System. An analysis comparing 
hospital discharge data, birth certificates, and Preg- 
nancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System question- 
naires showed low agreement between Pregnancy 
Risk Assessment Monitoring System and birth certif- 
icate records (Whitehead N, Callaghan W, Johnson 
C, Williams L. Maternal Morbidity Surveillance: 
Comparison of hospital discharge data, birth certifi- 
cates, and confidential questionnaires [abstract]. Am J 
Epidemiol 2004;159:S87). However, it is important to 
note that Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring 
System, discharge data, and birth certificates are 
usually measuring different constructs. For example, 
the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 
measure of high blood pressure includes preeclamp- 
sia or toxemia, while in the birth certificate only 
hypertension status is recorded. Pregnancy Risk As- 
sessment Monitoring System data are based on 
whether a woman recalls that she was hospitalized for 
a certain condition and, therefore, most likely under- 
estimates the number of women who experienced 
one of the maternal outcomes. Furthermore, there is 
no detailed information about the condition, for ex- 
ample the type of diabetes. Birth certificates are more 
likely to capture events at delivery, and the collection 
process for the birth certificate data varies by hospital. 
We decided in this analysis that since both have 
shortcomings, it would be better to include the data 
from both. Even if there is misclassification by using a 
composite maternal outcome measure of the Preg- 
nancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System and birth 
certificate data, 
it is unlikely that misclassification 
would differ by intention status. We conducted a 
sensitivity analysis for the outcomes of vaginal bleed- 
ing, diabetes, and hypertension to examine whether 
the associations with pregnancy intention were differ- 
ent when using only one source of data. The results 
only changed substantially for hypertension among 
pregnancies that were unwanted with a significant 
association when using the Pregnancy Risk Assess- 
ment Monitoring System data only. 
Finally, some may argue that our results are an 
artifact of conducting a number of comparisons; 
however, all of our analyses were biologically plausi- 
ble and based upon a priori hypotheses. We have 
reported all of our associations, not just the subset that 
was statistically significant. 
The relationship between pregnancy intention 
and maternal morbidities has been understudied. A 
recent study emphasized that maternal morbidities 
during labor and delivery are much more frequent 
than previously thought and that elucidation of the 
factors related to this burden is necessary35; more 
research will be necessary to determine the validity of 
our results. Our findings suggest that pregnancy in- 
tention may be an indicator for increased risk of poor 
outcomes, including low birth weight, preterm deliv- 
ery, and premature rupture of the membranes. There- 
fore, knowledge of pregnancy intention may help 
clinicians provide the best possible care to their 
patients.
