Abstract 
Intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization during pregnancy is a major 
public health concern, yet little is known about how risk factors for IPV 
during pregnancy may depend on whether women have histories of 
victimization dating back to early childhood (ages 0-5 years). This study 
examined whether risk factors for physical IPV victimization during 
pregnancy (a pregnancy that was not planned and prenatal substance use) 
differed for women with versus without early childhood victimization.

Participants were 236 ethnically diverse, low-income biological mothers 
(M = 30.94 years; 50.0% Latina, 16.9% Caucasian, 13.1% African American, 
and 16.9% multiracial) of children aged 0 to 6 years. Mothers were classified 
into four groups based on whether they had experienced early childhood 
victimization and physical IPV victimization during pregnancy with the 
target child. Multinomial logistic regressions, controlling for demographic 
characteristics, examined whether a pregnancy not planned and prenatal 
substance use predicted group membership. Compared to mothers with 
early victimization only, mothers with both early childhood victimization and 
physical IPV during pregnancy were more than 3 times as likely to report 
that their pregnancy with the target child was not planned. In follow-up 
analyses, mothers with early victimization and physical IPV during pregnancy 
also reported higher lifetime parity than mothers with physical IPV during 
pregnancy but no early victimization. Early childhood victimization may place 
women on a risk pathway to physical IPV during pregnancy, particularly if 
the pregnancy is not planned. Prevention and policy efforts should screen 
women for early childhood victimization to understand risks for physical IPV 
during pregnancy.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization during pregnancy is a wide- 
spread international concern, as it is associated with maternal physical and 
mental health risks and morbidity, fetal trauma, and perinatal and long-term 
complications in offspring (Jasinski, 2004; Pallitto, Campbell, & O’Campo, 
2005; Taillieu & Brownridge, 2010; World Health Organization [WHO], 
2011). Rates of prenatal victimization vary globally, from 1% to more than 
30%, depending on the region, definition of violence (e.g., physical vs. sex- 
ual or psychological), setting of screening (public or private clinic, hospital), 
and socioeconomic status (SES) of reporters (Campbell, García-Moreno, & 
Sharps, 2004; Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 1999; 
Gazmararian et al., 1996; Shumway et al., 1999; WHO, 2011). 
Recognizing the wide range of risks for IPV during pregnancy is critical 
for treating, screening, and preventing victimization in pregnant women. A 
recent meta-analysis of 92 studies that focused on physical IPV (defined as 
being hit, bit, slapped, pushed, or restrained) found that the strongest risk fac- 
tor for IPV victimization during pregnancy was IPV victimization prior to 
pregnancy (James, Brody, & Hamilton, 2013). However, women with 





previous victimization do not invariably experience physical IPV during 
pregnancy (Castro, Peek-Asa, García, Ruiz, & Kraus, 2003; Jasinski, 2004; 
Martin, English, Clark, Cilenti, & Kupper, 1996; Pallitto et al., 2005), and 
some women experience IPV for the first time during pregnancy (Taillieu & 
Brownridge, 2010). Thus, there is need for further differentiation of the risks 
for physical IPV victimization during pregnancy among women with or with- 
out previous victimization. 
Over the past two decades, research has specifically emphasized the 
effects of victimization and adversity during childhood on long-term func- 
tioning, in part due to the adverse childhood experiences studies (Felitti et al., 
1998). Studies have found that victimization in childhood significantly 
increases the odds of IPV victimization during pregnancy (Castro et al., 2003; 
Huth-Bocks, Krause, Ahlfs-Dunn, Gallagher, & Scott, 2013). Recent research 
has underscored that victimization (e.g., violence exposure and maltreat- 
ment) during early childhood (ages 0-5 years), in particular, has enduring 
consequences for adulthood IPV revictimization (Narayan, Englund, & 
Egeland, 2013). However, less is know about whether victimization in early 
childhood affects IPV victimization during pregnancy specifically. 
The present study focused on physical IPV victimization during preg- 
nancy, including physical bodily contact intending to contain, restrain, or 
inflict harm (e.g., being hit anywhere, choked, pushed, slapped, kicked, 
or thrown to the ground), or the use or threat to use a weapon such as a knife 
or gun. The rationale for a physical IPV scope was to build on the recent 
meta-analytic findings of James and colleagues (2013) and to clarify path- 
ways to victimization involving a single type of violence—physical—that 
has a more established definition than other types of violence (Black et al., 
2011; James et al., 2013). 
A Developmental Psychopathology (DP) 
Perspective 
The guiding framework of the present study is the DP perspective, which 
describes the course of maladaptive behavior and relationships as a progres- 
sion from early adverse experiences to cumulative and transactional interac- 
tions between individuals and their environments (Cicchetti & Toth, 2009; 
Masten, 2006). According to the DP perspective, experiences during early 
childhood, particularly those involving interpersonal relationships, exert a 
particularly strong and enduring influence into adulthood (Cicchetti & Toth, 
2009; Sroufe, Egeland, Carlson, & Collins, 2005; Waters & Cummings, 
2000). Early interpersonal victimization, including direct physical or sexual 
maltreatment of children, or indirect victimization, such as children’s 





exposure to interparental violence (EIPV), communicate that violence, 
power, and aggression are acceptable interpersonal tactics, which undermines 
the ability to feel safe and protected (Davies & Woitach, 2008; Lieberman & 
Van Horn, 2008). In turn, children may internalize violence and victimization 
as expected characteristics of intimate relationships, and they may reenact or 
subject themselves to these experiences in adult relationships (Cappell & 
Heiner, 1990; Waters & Cummings, 2000). 
Theoretically, early childhood victimization and the associated lack of 
protection from caregivers may undermine an individual’s expectation that 
she is worthy of protection and destabilize her ability to appropriately assess 
the risk for violence revictimization in adult relationships (Cappell & Heiner, 
1990; Davies & Woitach, 2008; Pratchett & Yehuda, 2011). This issue 
becomes salient during pregnancy when women must evaluate conditions of 
safety in regard to their unborn child (Lieberman, Díaz, & Van Horn, 2009). 
Pregnancy is a particularly important time to assess the risk for physical IPV 
because women are reorganizing and reprocessing their relationships, behav- 
iors, and early experiences to prepare for motherhood (Huth-Bocks et al., 
2013; Lieberman et al., 2009; Slade, Cohen, Sadler, & Miller, 2009). 
The DP perspective emphasizes that cumulative and contextual experi- 
ences also influence development, interplaying with early experiences to 
shape adaption and maladaption (Cicchetti & Toth, 2009; Sameroff, 2000; 
Sroufe et al., 2005). Numerous factors during the prenatal period likely affect 
the risk for physical IPV, including behavioral factors (e.g., substance use), 
social-contextual factors (e.g., a pregnancy that is not planned or intended), 
and sociodemographic factors (e.g., economic stress, low educational attain- 
ment; Jasinski, 2004; Martin et al., 1996; Pallitto et al., 2005; Taillieu & 
Brownridge, 2010). For instance, maternal prenatal substance use has been 
associated with prenatal physical IPV victimization, both because the pres- 
ence of alcohol and drugs may precipitate and escalate violent interactions 
between partners and because substance use is often a coping mechanism fol- 
lowing victimization (Chambliss, 2008; Lipsky, Holt, Easterling, & Critchlow, 
2005). A pregnancy being unplanned or unintended has also been associated 
with physical IPV during pregnancy (Campbell et al., 2004; Finer & Zolna, 
2011). An unintended pregnancy may precipitate IPV if the perpetrator does 
not want the pregnancy or questions the paternity (Chambliss, 2008). Indeed, 
women whose pregnancy was unintended were 2.5 to 4.1 times more likely to 
experience physical IPV during pregnancy than women whose pregnancy was 
intended (Gazmararian et al., 1995; Goodwin et al., 2000). 
Sociodemographic factors, such as low SES and educational attainment, 
are also significantly associated with increased risk of physical IPV during 
pregnancy (James et al., 2013; Jasinski, 2004). Women who experience 





physical IPV during pregnancy in the context of ongoing poverty not only 
face the aforementioned risks to maternal and fetal development associated 
with IPV, but they are also less likely to receive prenatal care and to have 
access to screening for IPV and health services (Chambliss, 2008; WHO, 
2011). These compounding risks may be particularly impactful for low- 
income and ethnic-minority women (Rodríguez, Valentine, Son, & 
Muhammad, 2009), the focal population of this study, thus presenting a key 
opportunity to identify women at substantial risk for physical IPV and in 
great need of services. 
A DP Perspective With a Person-Oriented 
Approach 
Understanding how early experiences and cumulative and contextual factors 
interplay to predict physical IPV during pregnancy could potentially improve 
screening and identification of at-risk women. Potentially, early childhood 
victimization may further amplify the increased risk for physical IPV during 
pregnancy in women with prenatal substance use or whose pregnancies are 
not planned. Given that developmental pathways are probabilistic rather than 
deterministic (Cicchetti & Toth, 2009; Sameroff, 2000), and not all victims of 
physical IPV during pregnancy experience prior victimization (Jasinski, 
2004; Pallitto et al., 2005; Taillieu & Brownridge, 2010), the current investi- 
gation focused on four mutually exclusive groups of women and the risk 
factors that differentiate them (i.e., prenatal substance use, pregnancy not 
planned, sociodemographic characteristics): women who (a) did not experi- 
ence early childhood victimization or physical IPV during pregnancy 
(“Neither”), (b) experienced early childhood victimization but not physical 
IPV during pregnancy (“Early Victimization Only”), (c) did not experience 
early childhood victimization but experienced physical IPV during preg- 
nancy (“IPV During Pregnancy Only”), and (d) experienced early childhood 
victimization and physical IPV during pregnancy (“Early+Pregnancy”). 

The present study used a person-oriented approach to address within-sample, 
between-group variation. A person-oriented approach, which has been called for 
in recent studies of violent behavior, is a strategy to identify person-specific 
characteristics by examining whether people or subgroups within samples can 
be differentiated from other subgroups based on common behaviors or experi- 
ences. As opposed to variable-oriented approaches, which examine patterns that 
characterize entire samples without regard to individual or subgroup variation, 





person-oriented approaches examine how within-sample variation differentiates 
groups of people to make sense of more individualized experiences (Bogat, 
Levendosky, & von Eye, 2005; Levendosky, 2013; Nurius & Macy 2008). 
Presently, a person-oriented approach was used to examine variation in the four 
groups to test whether substantiated prenatal risk factors for physical IPV vic- 
timization during pregnancy (prenatal substance use and a pregnancy that was 
not planned) significantly predicted group membership. 
Given the risks of physical IPV to maternal and child health and well-being 
(CDC, 1999; Jasinski, 2004; Pallitto et al., 2005; Taillieu & Brownridge, 2010; 
WHO, 2011), a person-oriented approach was also used to examine how mem- 
bership in each of the four groups was associated with variation in maternal 
reproductive functioning, such as lifetime parity (i.e., total number of pregnan- 
cies) and adverse child outcomes after birth (e.g., offspring trauma exposure). 
Research suggests that physical IPV during pregnancy may be linked to higher 
lifetime parity (Gee, Mitra, Wan, Chavkin, & Long, 2009; Pallitto et al., 2005; 
Taillieu & Brownridge, 2010), which is concerning if additional pregnancies also 
contain physical IPV, thereby further amplifying victimization of mothers and, 
potentially, traumatic exposure of their offspring. Moreover, given high rates of 
intergenerational adversity in individuals with childhood victimization (Narayan 
et al., in press), it is likely that offspring of mothers who were victimized in early 
childhood or during pregnancy would be at heightened risk for trauma exposure 
(Pratchett & Yehuda, 2011; Sroufe et al., 2005). Understanding how rates of life- 
time parity and offspring trauma exposure differ across the four groups would 
clarify strategies to deter intergenerational cycles of victimization. 

It was hypothesized that mothers who reported prenatal substance use and a preg- 
nancy with the target child that was not planned would have significantly greater 
likelihood of being in a group characterized by victimization in early childhood 
and/or during pregnancy compared with mothers with neither period of victim- 
ization. It was also hypothesized that, compared with mothers with neither period 
of victimization, mothers with one or both periods of victimization would have 
higher lifetime parity and offspring with greater trauma exposure. 


Participants were 236 biological mothers (M = 30.94, SD = 6.83; 50.0% 
Latina, 16.9% Caucasian, 13.1% African American, 16.9% multiracial or 





other) referred for clinical services at a university-affiliated clinical research 
program following their child’s exposure to a traumatic event (e.g., maltreat- 
ment, family or community violence, death of someone close, and so on). 
Families were primarily recruited through referrals from mental health ser- 
vice providers or case managers, flyers posted in the county hospital where 
the program was located, or self-referrals following a family’s experience of 
trauma. Target children (i.e., those for whom the mother was seeking ser- 
vices; 51.3% male) ranged from 0 to 6 years old (M = 3.65, SD = 1.30). The 
majority of children were first-born (60.2%), yet many mothers (55.1%) had 
more than one child (M = 1.77, SD = 0.87, range = 1-6 children). 
The institutional review board at the University of California, San 
Francisco approved all procedures. In-person informed consent was obtained 
before a maternal baseline interview, which assessed maternal early child- 
hood and IPV victimization, whether the pregnancy with the target child had 
been planned, psychological functioning, offspring traumatic event exposure, 
and demographics. The assessments were conducted in the mothers’ pre- 
ferred language (Spanish or English) by trained masters- and doctoral-level 
clinicians. 
Due to the nature of ongoing stress and trauma affecting many of these 
families, 37 additional biological mothers were enrolled but dropped out of 
the study before the assessment period was completed. As such, these women 
did not provide information about early childhood or IPV victimization. 
Attrition analyses indicated that these 37 families did not differ from the 236 
included families on any of the key independent or dependent variables in 
this study. 

Mothers’ early childhood victimization. Mothers completed the Life Stressors 
Checklist–Revised (LSC-R; Wolfe, Kimerling, Brown, Chrestman, & Levin, 
1996), comprised of 30 adverse lifetime experiences, including childhood 
maltreatment (e.g., physical abuse [PA] or sexual abuse [SA]) and EIPV. 
Mothers endorsed whether they had experienced each event and, if so, the 
age or range of ages that the event occurred. The present study focused on 
three types of early childhood (ages 0 to 5 years) victimization that are estab- 
lished precursors to violence victimization in adulthood: EIPV, PA, and SA 
(Fite et al., 2008; Narayan, Englund, Carlson, & Egeland, 2014; Narayan 
et al., 2013; Sroufe et al., 2005). Given that reports of victimization were 
retrospective and regarding early childhood, an inclusive approach was used: 
Mothers were considered to have a history of early childhood victimization if 
they endorsed EIPV, PA, or SA at or before age 5. Of these women, 37.7% 





endorsed any victimization (n = 89), 26.3% endorsed EIPV (n = 62), 11.0% 
endorsed PA (n = 26), and 13.9% endorsed SA (n = 33) between ages 0 to 5 
years. 
IPV during pregnancy. During the baseline interview, mothers were asked 
whether they had experienced any of 10 types of physical violence during 
their pregnancy with the target child: being hit in the head, stomach, or else- 
where; choked; pushed; slapped; kicked; thrown to the ground; knifed; or 
threatened/shot with a gun (α = .73). A dichotomous variable of any physical 
violence victimization (n = 83, 35.2%) was computed. Of these mothers, 
92.8% (n = 77) reported that the children’s fathers had been the perpetrators 
of the IPV during pregnancy. 
IPV during pregnancy was retrospectively reported, so the victimization 
was not necessarily ongoing. (Given the target child’s age, the pregnancy had 
taken place anywhere from 2 to 72 months prior to the baseline assessment.) 
Nevertheless, all mothers and children were involved in ongoing treatment 
and case management specifically designed to address any ongoing violence 
that was disclosed as part of the clinical services following the baseline inter- 
view. This clinical program had also obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality, 
which limited disclosure of identifying information about the participants 
during any court or legislative proceedings. 
Prenatal substance use. During the baseline interview, mothers were asked, 
“Was there substance use during pregnancy [with the target child]?” Given 
the low frequency of any substance use (16.1%, n = 38), a binary variable of 
“any prenatal substance use,” which included any alcohol or drug use during 
pregnancy, was created. 
Pregnancy not planned. Mothers were asked, “Was the pregnancy planned?” 
In the current study, responses were reverse-coded for a binary variable of 
“pregnancy not planned” (62.3%, n = 147). This terminology is used subse- 
quently because pregnancy research emphasizes the clear and specific usage 
and meaning of terminology such as “planned” versus “unplanned” and 
“intended” versus “unintended” (Barrett & Wellings, 2002). According to a 
survey study of pregnant women, “planned” may include several specific 
criteria besides intention of having a child, including cessation of contracep- 
tion, partner agreement, and lifestyle/life stage compatibility. Alternatively, 
labeling a pregnancy as “unplanned” may more generally pertain to circum- 
stances involving lack of foresight or preparation for a wanted pregnancy, as 
well as mistakes, accidents, and contraception failures resulting in unwanted 
pregnancies. Thus, “planned” versus “unplanned” pregnancies are not 





necessarily directly opposing circumstances (although “intended” was often 
interchangeable with “planned”; Barrett & Wellings, 2002). Given these find- 
ings and the wording of the original question asked of mothers, we use “preg- 
nancy not planned” rather than “unplanned” to describe the present variable. 
Lifetime maternal parity. During the baseline assessment, mothers indicated 
their total number of lifetime pregnancies, “How many pregnancies have you 
had (including the target child)?” 
Child exposure to traumatic events. During baseline, mothers also completed 
the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory—Parent Form, Revised (TESI; 
Ghosh Ippen et al., 2002), which assessed the target child’s exposure to 23 
adverse experiences, including maltreatment, exposure to family or commu- 
nity violence, accidental injury, loss or separation from caregivers, and other 
stressful events. This study used a sum of the total number of children’s trau- 
matic life events and a sum of just the three events that paralleled maternal 
early childhood victimization (i.e., EIPV, PA, and SA) from children’s birth 
to present. 

Covariates included maternal and child demographic characteristics, mater- 
nal victimization during middle childhood and adolescence, and recent/ongoing 
maternal mental state—operationalized as depressive symptoms and parent- 
ing distress—given that mothers were the primary informants on all 
measures. 
Child demographic characteristics included age and sex. Maternal demo- 
graphic characteristics included mothers’ age at the target child’s birth, time 
since pregnancy, SES (comprised of standardized educational attainment and 
average monthly income), and maternal ethnic–minority status of Latina or 
non-Latina. While prevalence and incidence rates of IPV in Latina women 
are comparable with non-Latina women (Ahrens, Rios-Mandel, Isas, & del 
Carmen Lopez, 2010; Klevens, 2007), impoverished Latina women may be 
less likely to disclose IPV or other family adversities and to seek necessary 
treatment. For instance, cultural norms (e.g., male-dominated relationships), 
family values (e.g., not disclosing personal information), and factors related 
to immigration status (e.g., fear of deportation) and acculturation (e.g., lan- 
guage barriers, lack of familiarity with service systems) may contribute to 
Latina women underreporting IPV or offspring trauma exposure (Ahrens 
et al., 2010; Klevens, 2007; Rodríguez et al., 2009). For these reasons, Latina 
ethnicity was added as a covariate in all analyses. 





Maternal victimization in middle childhood and adolescence was con- 
trolled to account for victimization occurring beyond early childhood. These 
variables were comprised of maternal reports from the LSC-R of the same 
three types of victimization (EIPV, PA, SA) from early childhood but pertain- 
ing to experiences in middle childhood (ages 6-12 years) and adolescence 
(ages 13-17 years). Victimization scores ranged from 0 to 3 types of exposure 
for each age period. 
Regarding maternal mental state, depressive symptomatology was 
assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-2; Beck, 
Steer, & Brown, 1996), a 21-item checklist of depressive symptoms on a 0- to 
3-point scale of symptoms over a 2-week period. Total scores ranged from 0 
to 63 (M = 18.52, SD = 11.83; α = .92). In the last year of data collection, the 
BDI-2 was replaced with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression 
Scale, Revised (CESD-R; Eaton, Smith, Ybarra, Muntaner, & Tien, 2004) 
because it offered more accessible language for both Spanish-speaking and 
disadvantaged populations. As a result, 11 participants were assessed using 
the CESD-R, which also uses a 0- to 3-point scale of depressive symptoms 
(M = 20.91, SD = 12.41). (Mean levels of depressive symptoms did not differ 
for participants who were administered the BDI-2 or the CESD-R, t(2, 225) 
= .15, p = ns.) Parental distress was assessed with the Parenting Stress Index, 
Short Form, Version 3 (PSI-SF; Abidin, 1990), a 36-item checklist of items 
on a 0- to 5-point scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. This study 
used the Parent Distress subscale, which assesses parental stress in the par- 
enting role (M = 31.56, SD = 9.82; α = .89). Raw scores at or above the 85th 
percentile indicate atypical stress (n = 106; 44.9%). Z scores of depression 
and parenting distress were averaged for parental mental state. 

The analyses proceeded in two parts and were conducted in SPSS Version 22. 
First, using multinomial logistic regression, we tested whether prenatal risk 
factors (pregnancy not planned and prenatal substance use) and covariates 
(maternal age, time since birth, SES, Latina ethnicity, middle childhood, and 
adolescent victimization) significantly predicted group membership. 
Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (95% CI) were used to 
reflect the strength of each coefficient after accounting for all the other vari- 
ables in the model. This approach has been used in previous developmental 
research on intergenerational patterns of risk (Jaffee et al., 2013). 
Next, three ANCOVA tests examined whether group membership was 
associated with mothers’ lifetime parity, with offspring exposure to total trau- 
matic events, and with traumatic events specifically reflecting victimization. 





Covariates were maternal demographic factors and mental state, and child 
age and sex. Significant ANCOVAs were examined for differences in adjusted 
marginal means, and p values were corrected with the Bonferroni method 
(α = .05/6 = .008). 

The rate of missing data was approximately 2.4% across the entire dataset, 
ranging from 0% (child sex, maternal ethnic–minority status) to 11.0% (SES) 
on individual variables. All non-covariate variables had less than 3% missing 
data. Data were assumed to be missing at random and were imputed using 
fully conditional specification in SPSS Version 22 (Rubin, 1987; Schafer & 
Graham, 2002). Twenty datasets were imputed, and pooled imputed results 
were compared with non-imputed results. The pattern of findings did not dif- 
fer between the raw and imputed results, with the exception of prenatal sub- 
stance use (see below), which was not significant according to the pooled 
results. All results presented below reflect the raw data. 

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for all variables by group and for the 
total sample. 
Results of the multinomial logistic regression analyses are presented in 
Table 2. As outlined earlier, it was hypothesized that prenatal substance use 
and a pregnancy not planned would correspond to greater odds of membership 
in the Early Victimization Only, IPV During Pregnancy Only, and 
Early+Pregnancy groups compared with the Neither group. As shown in Table 
2, mothers who reported prenatal substance use had greater odds of being in 
the Early Victimization Only group than in the Neither group (OR = 3.76, 95% 
CI = [1.08, 13.02], p < .01). However, this finding was not significant in the 
imputed results, potentially due to low endorsement of prenatal substance use 
across the whole sample. A pregnancy not planned did not significantly pre- 
dict membership in any of the victimization groups compared with member- 
ship in the Neither Group. However, mothers who reported a pregnancy not 
planned were significantly more likely to be in the Early+Pregnancy group 
than the Early Victimization Only group (see column G4 vs. G2 in Table 2; 
OR = 3.90, 95% CI = [1.19, 12.75], p < .05). 
In terms of covariates, middle childhood victimization was the only 
covariate that differentiated group membership. Mothers with middle child- 
hood victimization had significantly higher odds of being in the Early 
Victimization Only group compared with the Neither group (see column G2

with the IPV During Pregnancy Only group (see column G3 vs. G2, in Table

childhood victimization also had significantly higher odds of being in the

Results of the ANCOVA analyses are presented in Table 3. It was hypoth- 
esized that each of the three victimization groups would have higher lifetime 
parity compared with the Neither group. Indeed, group membership was sig- 
nificantly associated with higher lifetime parity, F(3, 184) = 3.11, p < .05, 
η2 = .04. Post hoc contrasts indicated a significant pairwise comparison in 
adjusted marginal means between the Early+Pregnancy group (M = 4.16, 
SE = .45) and the Pregnancy Only group (M = 2.52, SE = .36; p = .005; Table 
3). Of the covariates included, only maternal age predicted higher lifetime 
parity, F(1, 184) = 5.01, p < .05, η2 = .03. 
It was also hypothesized that offspring of mothers in each of the three 
victimization groups would have higher exposure to total traumatic events 
and to victimization-type events in particular. Group membership was sig- 
nificantly associated with greater offspring exposure to total traumatic events, 
F(3, 184) = 3.24, p < .05, η2 = .05. However, while the Early+Pregnancy and 
IPV During Pregnancy Only groups had offspring with greater trauma expo- 
sure at α = .05, Bonferroni-corrected pairwise contrasts indicated that no con- 
trasts were significantly different. Of the covariates, maternal Latina ethnicity, 
F(1, 184) = 11.78, p < .01, η2 = .06; parental mental state, F(1, 184) = 12.84, 
p < .01, η2 = .07; and child age, F(1, 184) = 6.62, p < .05, η2 = .04, also sig- 
nificantly predicted greater total traumatic events. Finally, group membership 


 



was not associated with greater exposure to offspring victimization, F(3, 182) 
= 2.06, p = ns. However, maternal Latina ethnicity, F(1, 182) = 4.98, p < .05, 
η2 = .03, and parental mental state, F(1, 182) = 6.10, p < .05, η2 = .03, pre- 
dicted greater offspring victimization exposure. 

Using a DP perspective, which emphasizes the roles of early, cumulative, and 
contextual experiences in shaping development and adaptation, as well as a 
person-oriented approach to understand within-sample variation in groups 
who share characteristic behavior and experiences, the hypotheses were two- 
fold. First, it was predicted that prenatal risk factors for physical IPV victim- 
ization during pregnancy, including substance use and pregnancy not planned, 
would predict women’s membership in groups characterized by early child- 
hood victimization, physical IPV during pregnancy, or both, compared with 
neither form of victimization. Results pertaining to prenatal substance use 
were only weakly supported. A higher percentage of women in all three of the 
victimization groups reported prenatal substance use (approximately 19% 
across all three groups) compared with women with neither form of victim- 
ization (approximately 11%); however, these results did not hold in the 
imputed data. The low endorsement of prenatal substance use across the 
whole sample potentially precluded detection of significant group differ- 
ences. Furthermore, this low endorsement could have been due to women’s 
general unease in disclosing any alcohol or drug use during pregnancy. 
Moreover, given that women only reported whether they had ever used any 
alcohol or drugs at any time during pregnancy, quantity or frequency of use 
was not captured, yet these characteristics of use may have been important 
undetected factors in predicting group differences. Group differences also 
might have been evident had we assessed fathers’ substance use patterns, 
given established risks for physical IPV victimization during pregnancy 
when the partner is using alcohol or drugs (Chambliss, 2008; Lipsky et al., 
2005). 
Having a pregnancy that was not planned also did not predict membership 
in any of the victimization groups compared with the group without victim- 
ization. However, women who reported a pregnancy with the target child that 
was not planned were almost 4 times more likely to be a member of the 
Early+Pregnancy group than to be a member of the Early Victimization Only 
group. This finding suggests that a pregnancy that is not planned coupled 
with previous victimization in early childhood may be a more potent risk for 
physical IPV during pregnancy than early victimization on its own. In other 
words, women who have experienced early childhood victimization and then 





have a pregnancy that is not planned may be at particularly high risk for being 
physically victimized during pregnancy. This finding aligns with previous 
literature showing that an unintended pregnancy contributes to risk for physi- 
cal IPV during pregnancy (CDC, 1999; Chambliss, 2008; Jasinski, 2004; 
Taillieu & Brownridge, 2010) and extends past research to suggest that for 
women who also experienced EIPV, PA, or SA before age 5, a pregnancy not 
planned may further increase the risk for physical IPV during pregnancy. 
Although not hypothesized, victimization in middle childhood (ages 6-12 
years) also differentiated group membership. Women who reported middle 
childhood victimization were significantly more likely to be in a group with 
early childhood victimization 
(the Early Victimization Only and 
Early+Pregnancy groups) than in a group without early childhood victimiza- 
tion (the IPV During Pregnancy Only and Neither groups). However, differ- 
ences in adolescent victimization were not evident across groups. These 
findings suggest that the period spanning early and middle childhood may be 
a cumulative pathway associated with elevated risk for physical IPV victim- 
ization during pregnancy, particularly if the pregnancy is not planned. 
The second set of hypotheses predicted that women with either or both 
periods of victimization would have higher lifetime parity, total offspring 
trauma exposure, and offspring exposure to victimization than women with 
neither period of victimization. Differences in lifetime parity were evident 
across the four groups, albeit in an unexpected way. Women in the 
Early+Pregnancy group had significantly higher lifetime parity than women 
in the IPV During Pregnancy Only group. These findings suggest that early 
victimization may affect patterns of reproductive functioning, beyond physi- 
cal IPV victimization circumscribed to pregnancy (Gee et al., 2009; Taillieu 
& Brownridge, 2010). When physical IPV during pregnancy follows previ- 
ous victimization in early childhood, it may be associated with higher rates of 
lifetime parity. 
It is important to note, however, that higher lifetime parity in and of itself 
is not a negative outcome. Whether subsequent pregnancies may have con- 
tained IPV or may not have been planned was not assessed in the present 
study; thus, any risks or characteristics associated with other pregnancies are 
unknown. It is also unknown whether women’s other pregnancies resulted in 
full-term births or not. Thus, the nature of the association between early vic- 
timization, physical IPV during pregnancy, and lifetime parity is a viable area 
for future research to clarify. 
Contrary to hypotheses, group differences in offspring exposure to total 
traumatic events or to victimization events did not reach statistical signifi- 
cance. Of clinical significance, however, women who experienced physical 
IPV during pregnancy with or without early childhood victimization (IPV 





During Pregnancy Only and Early+Pregnancy groups) had offspring who 
experienced approximately one more traumatic event than women without 
physical IPV during pregnancy (both the Early Victimization Only and 
Neither groups). Despite not being statistically significant, the presence of 
one additional traumatic event for offspring, depending on its nature, could 
substantially impact the course of functioning and well-being in children and 
families. 
The present findings also illuminated cultural differences in offspring 
exposure to traumatic events. Latina mothers endorsed higher offspring 
exposure to total traumatic events and to victimization-type traumatic events 
than non-Latina mothers. While it is not known whether these ethnic differ- 
ences are due to higher rates of actual trauma or to differences in disclosure 
rates between Latina and non-Latina women, this finding is contrary to past 
research that Latina women may be less likely to disclose family hardships to 
health providers (Ahrens et al., 2010; Klevens, 2007). One reason for this 
contradiction might be that all women in the current study were seeking treat- 
ment for their child, potentially increasing their willingness to disclose infor- 
mation about offspring trauma exposure. Relatedly, during baseline, women 
were speaking with interviewers whom they knew would be their therapists 
following the assessment period. Latina women were often paired with cul- 
turally informed, Spanish-speaking therapists, potentially facilitating disclo- 
sure. Future research should explore more nuanced understanding of ethnic 
and cultural differences, not only in rates of maternal physical IPV, offspring 
trauma exposure, and disclosure of both, but also regarding the intersection 
of substance use, IPV, and pregnancies that are not planned. 

Notable strengths are that the present study addressed the need for more tai- 
lored, person-oriented approaches that emphasize within-sample variation 
(Bogat et al., 2005; Levendosky, 2013; Nurius & Macy, 2008) when under- 
standing risks for physical IPV victimization in pregnant women. The sample 
also encompassed a range of ethnic diversity and SES, thereby illuminating 
the experiences and needs of underserved populations. More research is 
needed on how early victimization affects pathways to prenatal victimization, 
reproductive functioning, parenting, and child well-being in ethnic-minority 
families, and this study provides a step in that direction. 
There were several limitations. In terms of design limitations, this study 
was cross-sectional and only measured physical IPV victimization, prenatal 
substance use, and status of pregnancy as planned for one child. This 
precluded identifying directional relations between these variables, the 





associations with the presence of physical IPV victimization across all preg- 
nancies, and the extent to which physical IPV victimization and substance 
use may have been situational and resolved over the course of the pregnancy. 
The associations between physical IPV victimization during pregnancy, pre- 
natal substance use, and planned pregnancies are likely multidirectional cir- 
cumstances rather than linear associations. Moreover, it would have been 
optimal to have obtained information on the fathers’ behavior, such as their 
involvement in substance use and their role as physical IPV perpetrators or 
victims. Notably, in other samples, up to 30% of pregnant women reported 
engaging in physical IPV perpetration against the father (Lieberman et al., 
2009), suggesting that physical IPV during pregnancy is often bidirectional. 
In terms of measurement limitations, reports of early childhood victimiza- 
tion and physical IPV during pregnancy were obtained by retrospective 
maternal report. In an effort to minimize potential recall errors and reporting 
bias, this study used inclusive, dichotomous scores of physical IPV victim- 
ization during pregnancy and early childhood victimization, and it controlled 
for maternal mental state at the time of reports. In addition, some variables 
were drawn from limited and non-standardized instruments, such as physical 
IPV victimization during pregnancy, or from single-question items (e.g., 
whether the pregnancy was planned or alcohol/drug use occurred), in part 
because the larger study did not specifically focus on these constructs. It 
would have been preferable to know about different types of IPV (e.g., psy- 
chological and sexual victimization were not assessed) and to have more 
comprehensive, standardized assessments of substance use and family plan- 
ning. In terms of ecologically valid findings, participating dyads were referred 
for treatment following offspring trauma exposure, so the results may not 
generalize to non-treatment-seeking populations. Furthermore, because the 
larger treatment program was for mothers with children, mothers who expe- 
rienced physical IPV and lost the pregnancy were not included, nor were 
women victimized in early childhood who did not have children. 

Victimization in early childhood may place women on a heightened risk path- 
way to physical IPV during pregnancy, specifically if their pregnancies are 
not planned. Women with dual experiences of early victimization and physi- 
cal IPV during pregnancy also may, in turn, have higher lifetime parity and 
their children may be at incremental risk of experiencing more traumatic 
events. It is critical that future research, prevention, and policy efforts con- 
sider pregnant women’s early childhood experiences and whether their preg- 
nancies are planned when evaluating how to prevent physical IPV during 





pregnancy and deter intergenerational cycles of trauma in families. Potentially, 
universal screening for early childhood victimization should be implemented 
at prenatal visits to assess the extent to which pregnant women have histories 
of early and cumulative experiences of victimization. Continued efforts to 
isolate and deter early childhood adversity would likely have lasting effects 
on well-being across generations.
