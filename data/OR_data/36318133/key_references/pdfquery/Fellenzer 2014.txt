Intendedness of Pregnancy and Other Predictive Factors 
for Symptoms of Prenatal Depression in a Population-Based Study 


Abstract Prenatal depression (PD) as a risk factor for 
adverse birth outcomes is well documented. Less is known 
about maternal risks for PD, which could inform preventive 
strategies for perinatal and interconceptional care. This 
exploratory study investigates associations between pre- 
natal depression symptoms and unintended and mistimed 
pregnancies and other maternal risk factors for PD. A 
subset of birth records from the New York Statewide 
Perinatal Data System (n = 19,219) was used in this sec- 
ondary analysis of cross-sectional data. Univariate and 
multivariate multinomial regression was used to identify 
factors that are independently associated with four self- 
reported levels of prenatal depression symptoms. Women 
with unintended pregnancies were more likely (AOR, 95 % 
CI) to report severe (3.6, 2.6–5.1) or moderate (2.0, 
1.6–2.5) prenatal depression symptoms and less likely to 
report no symptoms, compared to women with intended 
pregnancies. Likewise, women with mistimed pregnancies 
were more likely to report severe (2.7, 2.2–3.5) or mod- 
erate (1.7, 1.5–2.1) prenatal depression symptoms than no 
symptoms, compared to women with intended pregnancies. 
Low education, drug use, smoking, minority race, being 
unmarried and having Medicaid insurance were also sig- 
niﬁcant, independent predictors of PD symptoms. Results 
suggest that routine screening for depression, intendedness

Depression that begins during pregnancy is a prevalent 
form of obstetric morbidity that elevates risk of poor 
pregnancy outcomes, including slower fetal growth rates, 
premature delivery and low birth weight [1–4]. One study 
reported that women with prenatal depression (PD) had 
13 % greater incidence of premature delivery (OR 2.61) 
and 15 % greater incidence of low birth weight (OR 4.75) 
than non-depressed women [2]. These adverse outcomes 
may be mediated by stress and depression-induced 
increases in cortisol and other changes in maternal and 
infant body chemistry [2–4] and the adverse effects of 
frequently co-occurring risks such as use of tobacco, 
alcohol and other drugs and inadequate medical care that 
are associated with prenatal depression [5]. Furthermore, 
prenatal depression has been shown to be a strong predictor 
of postpartum depression [6–9], which would extend and 
compound risks for the developing infant and mother [10]. 
Prenatal depression is estimated to occur in 10–20 % of 
pregnancies in the US [11, 12]. However, studies show that 
only 18 % of pregnant women who meet criteria for 
depressive disorders seek treatment during pregnancy and 


postpartum [13]. Consequently, a majority of cases of 
treatment, 
prenatal depression do not 
despite multiple visits to health care providers during 
pregnancy. Prenatal depression is potentially modiﬁable, 
especially when identiﬁed early in pregnancy [14–18]. 
Additional knowledge of risk factors for PD, increased 
attention to modiﬁable factors and a preventive approach to 
early identiﬁcation of at-risk women by health care pro- 
viders could reduce risks and morbidity attributable to 
to postpartum 
prenatal depression, and in some cases, 
depression as well. 
Researchers have explored risk factors for depression 
during pregnancy and have found numerous maternal 
psychological, social, economic, demographic, health and 
behavioral factors that have univariate associations with 
prenatal depression [5, 19–21]. Unintended pregnancy has 
been evaluated as an adjusted risk factor for prenatal 
depression in a relatively small number of studies, but most 
have shown a positive relationship between unintended 
pregnancy and symptoms of PD [5, 6, 22–26]. A large, 
nationally representative cohort study of more than 11,000 
infants in Ireland found that unintended pregnancy was 
associated with an increased risk of prenatal depression 
(RR 1.36, 95 % CI 1.19–1.54) [25]. A cohort study of 
1,600 US pregnancies revealed an association between 
mid-pregnancy depression symptoms and unwanted preg- 
nancy (OR 2.05, 95 % CI 1.12–3.75) [6]. Bunevicius et al. 
[24] studied the prevalence of, and risk factors for prenatal 
depression by trimester in a sample of Lithuanian women 
and found a strong association between unintended and 
unwanted pregnancies and prenatal depressive disorder in 
all three trimesters, with AORs (95 % CI) ranging from 
6.07 (1.64–22.46) to 15.35 (3.18–72.24). 
This study investigates risk factors for prenatal depres- 
sion, focusing on unintended and mistimed pregnancies. Our 
study aim is to increase understanding of the effect of 
pregnancy intendedness and other predictive factors on PD 
symptoms through secondary analysis of a population-based 
sample. For health care providers, more information about 
who may be at elevated risk for prenatal depression is crucial 
to planning and implementing preventive approaches to the 
identiﬁcation (via screening for depression, intendedness 
and other associated risk factors) and treatment of depression 
during all stages of reproductive health care. 

The cross-sectional sample for our secondary analysis 
included all women with recorded births of live infants in a 
13-county region in central New York State during 2011 
(N = 19,219). This region includes the cities of Water- 
town, Syracuse, and Binghamton NY, has a mix of urban,

Within 72 h after delivery, women in this study were 
asked via written survey to reﬂect back on their pregnancy 
and self-rate their prenatal depression symptoms and their 
desire/intention to become pregnant just before their latest 
pregnancy, given the following choices: wanted to be 
pregnant… ‘sooner’, ‘then’, ‘later’, and ‘not then or in the 
future’ [27]. Responses for the ﬁrst two categories were 
combined for statistical analysis and the resulting three 
categories are hereafter referred to as ‘intended’ (the ref- 
erent category), ‘mistimed’ and ‘unintended’, respectively. 
Of the original 19,219 SPDS records, 1,160 (6.0 %) 
cases were excluded, including 825 (4.3 %) cases with a 
missing outcome variable and 335 (1.7 %) with one or 
more missing predictor variables. Comparisons of charac- 
teristics of women with missing and non-missing prenatal 
depression symptoms were conducted using Chi square and 
exact probability tests. 
Non-collinear potential predictor variables with unadjusted 
odds ratios C1.5 (equivalent to r C 0.1, a ‘‘small’’ effect size 
[28]) for prenatal depression in the univariate analyses were 
selected for preliminary multivariate regression modeling 
(Table 2). Predictor variables with non-signiﬁcant (p C 0.05) 
adjusted odds ratios in the preliminary multivariate models 
were excluded from the ﬁnal model (Table 3). All multivar- 
iate models used simultaneous entry of predictor variables. 
All research was conducted in accordance with pre- 
vailing ethical standards. All statistical analyses used two- 
tailed tests of signiﬁcance, a priori a = 0.05 and 95 % CIs, 
and were carried out using SPSS, Version 20. 
suburban and rural populations, and has demographic and 
socioeconomic proﬁles that are similar to much of the US. 
Self-reported symptoms of depression during pregnancy, 
pregnancy intendedness and a set of other potential pre- 
dictor variables (Table 1) based on literature review and 
availability were obtained from the New York Statewide 
Perinatal Data System (SPDS) after receiving exempt sta- 
tus from the Institutional Review Board of SUNY Upstate 
Medical University. The sample was chosen based on 
convenient access to the data and because we thought it 
was likely to be representative of many regions of the US. 
The outcome of interest is a self-rated measure of severity 
of depression symptoms during pregnancy with ﬁve levels: 
‘not depressed at all’, ‘a little depressed’, ‘moderately 
depressed’, ‘very depressed’, and ‘very depressed and had to 
get help’. The latter two levels were combined for the sta- 
tistical analyses, and the four categories of symptom severity 
are hereafter referred to as ‘none’ (the referent category), 
‘mild’, ‘moderate’ and ‘severe’. The SPDS measure of 
depression symptoms was originally developed for use by 
the Prenatal Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) 
[27], and has been ﬁeld-tested and validated. 

The prevalence of self-reported depression symptoms 
during pregnancy and the set of potential risk factors 
included in this study are summarized in Table 1. The 
prevalence of self-reported levels of no symptoms, mild, 
and severe prenatal depression symptoms 
moderate 
was 70, 22, 6 and 2 %, respectively. About 62 % of 
women reported that their pregnancy was intended, 30 % 
reported it as mistimed and approximately 9 % said it was 
unintended. 
The univariate multinomial regression analysis identi- 
ﬁed a subset of the risk factors we evaluated (Table 1) that 
met our criteria for preliminary multivariate analysis. 
These variables are shown in Table 2. Variables in the ﬁnal 
model are shown in Table 3. 

The adjusted odds ratios and 95 % CIs for predictive 
variables retained in the ﬁnal multinomial logistic regres- 
sion model are presented in Table 3. Compared to women

with intended pregnancies, the adjusted odds (95 % CI for 
AOR, 95 % CI for r, an effect size measure, p value) of 
severe depressive symptoms (vs. no symptoms) were 3.6 
(2.6–5.1, r = 0.25–0.41, p \ 0.001) 
for 
women with unintended pregnancies. Similarly, women 
with mistimed 
(2.0–3.5, 
pregnancies were 
r = 0.19–0.33, p \ 0.001) times more likely to report 
severe depression symptoms (vs. no symptoms) than were 
women with intended pregnancies. We also observed 
similar patterns of smaller, but signiﬁcant AORs (ranging 
from 1.7 to 2.0, r = 0.14–0.19, all p \ 0.001) for moderate 
and mild depression symptoms (vs. no symptoms) associ- 
ated with unintended and mistimed pregnancies, relative to 
the odds for intended pregnancies. 


Maternal drug use during pregnancy was also found to be 
strongly associated with prenatal depression (Table 3). 
Women whose medical records indicated prenatal use of 
illicit drugs or non-prescribed medications were [AOR 
(95 % CI)] 3.2 (2.2–4.5) and 1.5 (1.1–2.0) times more 
likely to report severe and moderate depression symptoms 
than no symptoms, respectively, when compared to women 
with no known history of prenatal drug use. 

Compared to non-smokers, women who smoked during the 
trimester were more likely to report prenatal 
ﬁrst 
depression symptoms than no symptoms, independent of 
other risk factors (Table 3). For example, women who 
reported smoking 20 or more cigarettes per day during the 
ﬁrst trimester were [AOR (95 % CI)] 3.1 (1.7–5.4) times 
more likely to report moderate symptoms rather than no 
symptoms of PD, compared to the non-smokers. Compared 
to non-smokers, smoking as few as one to nine cigarettes 
per day during the ﬁrst trimester was a signiﬁcant, inde- 
pendent predictor of an increased likelihood [AOR (95 % 
CI)] of reporting mild 1.4 (1.2–1.5), moderate 1.9 (1.5–2.3) 
or severe 1.7 (1.2–2.5) symptoms of PD, rather than no 
symptoms. 

Adjusted relative odds for prenatal depression symptoms 
vs. no symptoms were also generally higher for women 
with lower levels of educational attainment (compared to 
college graduates), for younger mothers (compared to older 
mothers), for Hispanic and Black mothers (compared to 
White mothers) and for those with Medicaid insurance 
(compared to private or other insurance, Table 3). 

Maternal risk factors for self-reported prenatal depression 
symptoms and for poor pregnancy outcomes frequently co- 
occur in pregnant women. For example, 11.8 % of women 
with unintended or mistimed pregnancies used drugs dur- 
ing pregnancy, 10 times the rate observed for intended

pregnancies (1.8 %), and 66.4 % of the drug users were 
carrying an unintended or mistimed child. Nearly one-third 
(30.7 %) of women with unintended pregnancies and 
28.5 % of women with mistimed pregnancies smoked 
during pregnancy; in contrast 13.9 % with intended preg- 
nancies smoked during their pregnancy. Furthermore, 
67.4 % of women known to use drugs during pregnancy 
also smoked during pregnancy. 
Comparisons of characteristics of women with missing 
(vs. non-missing) prenatal depression symptoms found that 
women with missing information about PD symptoms were 
signiﬁcantly more likely to be Black (11.4 % of missing 
cases vs. 7.2 % of non-missing cases), be 35 years old or 
older (16.4 vs. 11.5 %) have Medicaid insurance (51.2 vs. 
40.7 %), have no high school diploma (28.2 vs. 14.6 %) 
and have unintended (12.6 vs. 8.6 %) or mistimed (37.9 vs. 
29.2 %) pregnancies. 

Nearly 30 % of childbearing women in our sample repor- 
ted some prenatal depression symptoms, which is higher 
than the range of 10–20 % commonly reported in US 
studies [11, 12, 29]. One possible explanation is that our 
sample of US births is, in fact, a census of births in a 
13-county region in central New York, and may capture 
more women with prenatal depression than other (e.g. 
facility-based) sampling methods. Alternatively, it could be 
that women in this region have greater prevalence of PD 


than the norm. Another possible explanation is misclassi- 
ﬁcation due to different instruments used to measure pre- 
natal depression across studies; some portion of the women 
who reported mild symptoms in our study might not be 
classiﬁed as having depressive symptoms using other 
depression screens. About 8 % reported moderate or severe 
prenatal depression symptoms, which is in line with esti- 
mates of PD from other studies, and these women are the 
focus of our ﬁndings. In addition, missing value analysis 
for prenatal depression symptoms revealed that women 
with missing information about PD symptoms tend to have 
characteristics associated with elevated risk of moderate or 
severe symptoms, which suggests that the prevalence of 
moderate and severe symptoms may be greater than 8 % in 
this population. 

Our ﬁndings suggest an inverse association between 
intendedness of pregnancy and symptoms of prenatal 
depression, with 95 % CI estimates of AORs for severe PD 
(referent: no PD symptoms) of 2.6–5.1 
symptoms 
(r = 0.25–0.41) 
(referent: 
intended pregnancies) and 2.0–3.5 (r = 0.19–0.33) for 
mistimed pregnancies (Table 3). Based on Cohen’s [28] 
guidelines, the effect sizes we observed for the independent 
(i.e., adjusted) relationship between pregnancy intended- 
ness and severe depressive symptoms ranged from nearly- 
moderate to nearly-strong. Although Cohen’s guidelines 
are meant to be interpreted in the context of other similar 
studies (see below), we ﬁnd it striking to observe these 
levels of independent effects for pregnancy intendedness, 
because prenatal depression is likely to be affected by a 
complex combination of multiple interacting biological, 
physiological, psychosocial and environmental factors. 
Our ﬁndings are consistent with other reports [6, 24, 25], 
in which AORs for depressive symptoms in unintended 
pregnancy [AOR, (95 % CI for AOR, 95 % CI for r)] 
varied between 1.36 (1.19–1.54, r = 0.05–0.13) and 15.35 
(3.18–74.24, r = 0.30–0.76) times the odds for depressive 
symptoms in intended pregnancies [24, 25]. It is interesting 
that most of the studies of unintended pregnancy and risk 
for prenatal depression show convergent results, because 
they differ markedly in terms of study design, sampling 
instruments used to measure 
methods and populations, 
depressive symptoms and pregnancy intendedness, and in 
the covariates controlled in the adjusted odds ratios [6, 21, 
24, 25]. Replicated results under disparate conditions 
suggest that the association between unintended and mist- 
imed pregnancies and prenatal depression symptoms may 
be relatively strong, consistent and insensitive to differ- 
ences in methods and measures among studies. 
There is evidence to suggest that women with unin- 
tended pregnancies have greater risk of adverse pregnancy 
outcomes than women with intended pregnancies [1–4, 
30–32]. Orr et al. [30] evaluated the association between 

intendedness of pregnancy and preterm birth in a large 
prospective cohort and found that unintended pregnancy 
was 
preterm delivery 
associated with 
(adjusted RR 1.82, 95 % CI 1.08–3.08, p = 0.026). 
Another study found that women who reported that their 
pregnancies were unwanted had more than twice the risk 
of infant mortality during the ﬁrst 28 days following 
delivery than women with intended pregnancies [31]. In a 
case–control study, Sable et al. [32] showed that mothers 
of very low birth weight infants were signiﬁcantly more 
likely to report 
the 
pregnancy (OR 1.53) than those who had a normal-weight 
baby. 


It also appears that on the whole, women with unin- 
tended pregnancies and those with prenatal depression 
share similar risk proﬁles for poor pregnancy outcomes. A 
study of women with unintended or mistimed pregnancies 
using PRAMS data found that compared to women with 
intended pregnancies, mothers with unintended and misti- 
med pregnancies were more likely to consume less than the 
recommended amount of preconception folic acid (AOR 
2.4, 95 % CI 1.7–3.2), smoke prenatally (2.0, 1.5–2.9), 
smoke postpartum (1.9, 1.4–2.6) and report postpartum 
depression (2.0, 1.5–2.6) [33]. 
In addition, these women were less likely than women 
with intended pregnancies to initiate prenatal care during 
the ﬁrst trimester (0.3, 0.3–0.5) and breastfeed for 8 or 
more weeks (0.7, 0.6–1.0) [33]. In this study, we also found 
a negative relationship between self-reported prenatal 
depression symptoms and breastfeeding at hospital dis- 
charge; 39.4 % (650/1,561) of mothers with unintended 
pregnancies were breastfeeding, while the comparable rates 
for mothers with mistimed and intended pregnancies were 
51.7 % (2,688/5,199) and 64.0 % (7,201/11,250), respec- 
tively (v2 = 422.4, df = 2, p \ 0.001, V = 0.15). Similar 
to the Cheng et al. study [33], other research conﬁrms the 
association between unintended or unwanted pregnancies 
and continued smoking [34, 35]. Thus it appears that un- 
intendedness, in and of itself, may signal a need for further 
inquiry regarding history of other risk factors during pre- 
natal care visits. We discuss using this signal 
in our 
conclusions. 
Consistent with many studies [5], we found that com- 
pared to mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy, 
mothers who smoked during the ﬁrst trimester of preg- 
nancy were about 2–3 times more likely to report moderate 
or severe symptoms of prenatal depression rather than no 
symptoms (Table 3). There was also a strong trend towards 
greater numbers of cigarettes smoked per day being asso- 
levels of depression symptoms 
ciated with higher 
(Table 3). 
It is well documented that maternal smoking during 
threats to the fetus and 






developing infant. As cited and summarized in Roy et al. 
[36], children of women who smoke during pregnancy 
show ‘‘low birth weight [37], increased risk of stillbirth 
[38], 
and 
increased asthma and wheezing [40] as well as behavioral 
abnormalities, including increased evidence of attentional 
deﬁcits, impaired learning and memory, lowered IQ, and 
cognitive dysfunction’’. Other studies have also revealed 
that women who smoke during pregnancy may have 
increased incidence of depression and thus reduced moti- 
vation to quit smoking during pregnancy [41]. Although 
screening for smoking may be routine during the initial 
prenatal visit, it may be frequently discussed in isolation 
from other barriers to quitting that also adversely impact 
pregnancy outcomes, such as unintended pregnancy, stress, 
anxiety and depression. In our conclusions, we recommend 
an integrated approach to risk screening and better coor- 
dinated interventions. 
We also observed strong associations between drug use 
and reported prenatal depression symptoms, after adjusting 
for smoking and other predictive factors. Compared to 
women not known to use drugs, women who did were 3.2 
times more likely to report severe symptoms of depression 
rather than no symptoms. Our ﬁndings are similar to other 
reports regarding drug use and depression [5] and drug use 
and intendedness [42, 43]. 
Other studies have demonstrated increased risk for 
perinatal depression or prenatal depression symptoms 
associated with low educational attainment [44, 45], His- 
panic ethnicity [6] and Black race [46, 47]. We likewise 
found that women with low education and Hispanic and 
Black mothers are at increased risk for severe PD symp- 
toms during pregnancy after controlling for intendedness 
and other socioeconomic and behavioral factors (Table 3). 

The outcome variable is a measure of severity of depres- 
sion symptoms during pregnancy, and is not a clinical 
diagnosis of depression by a qualiﬁed practitioner. In 
addition, it is based on a single question, unlike most 
standard screening tools for depression, which have mul- 
tiple questions and dimensions. Furthermore, prenatal 
depression symptoms and pregnancy intendedness are self- 
reported measures that were collected after delivery, and 
are therefore subject to recall bias [46, 47]. One source of 
bias is that the birth outcome was known at the time of data 
collection, which may inﬂuence a mother’s retrospective 
assessment of intendedness and depression symptoms. In 
addition, birth intendedness is a subjective concept that 
may be inﬂuenced by social norms and stigma [48]. The 
social bias is for women who did not want to get pregnant 
to report they had wanted the pregnancy. 


The use of data sets for secondary analysis—like birth 
records—that are not designed around speciﬁc research 
questions can result in incomplete information; for exam- 
ple, the SPDS data does not distinguish between chronic 
depressive symptoms and symptoms originating in the 
prenatal period. Furthermore, the distribution of unmea- 
sured confounders could be unequally distributed among 
childbearing women with and without symptoms of pre- 
natal depression. Similarly, the results of our (and any) 
regression modeling procedures may be sensitive to the 
particular set of predictor variables that were included. 
This study is also subject to the general limitations of 
any cross-sectional study. The concurrent measurement of 
predictive factors and prenatal depression symptoms pre- 
cludes assessment of the temporal 
sequence between 
exposures of interest and prenatal depression symptoms. 
For example, we found strong relationships between in- 
tendedness of pregnancy, self-reported depressive symp- 
toms, smoking and substance abuse. Although it was not 
our aim, our cross-sectional study cannot assess causal 
pathways and the temporal sequence of 
relationships 
within this constellation of risk factors. 
Central New York, like many regions and US states, has 
a relatively small minority population compared to the US 
as a whole. In our sample, Whites made up 80.7 % of the 
birth mothers, whereas US birth mothers consisted of 
54.4 % Whites and 45.6 % minorities in 2010 [49]. Lower 
minority representation in our sample must be considered 
when assessing the generalizability of our study results to 
regions with larger proportions of minorities. 


This is the ﬁrst study of pregnancy intendedness as a pre- 
dictor of prenatal depression symptoms that uses a large, 
population-based sample. Our study also uses validated and 
ﬁeld-tested PRAMS questions to measure self-reported 
prenatal depression symptoms and pregnancy intendedness. 
for underrepresentation of minorities, most 
socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of our 
sample are similar to the US proﬁle of birthing mothers. 
For example, 33.1 % of US birth mothers were 24 and 
younger and 14.5 % were 35 and older in 2010 [49]. In our 
sample, 34.4 % of mothers were 24 or younger and 11.7 % 
were 35 and older. Our sample was also similar to the US 
proﬁle for education, smoking and use of WIC. 
We also found that our estimate of the overall preva- 
lence of moderate and severe PD symptoms is within range 
of other published studies that used different methods, 
instruments and facilities-based samples. Most importantly, 
our ﬁndings on the association between intendedness and 
prenatal depression symptoms and on other risk factors for 
PD are entirely consistent with the results of longitudinal 

studies that measured depression symptoms using a variety 
of standard screening tools (e.g. BDI-II, CES-D and EPDS) 
throughout the course of the pregnancy and into the post- 
partum period. These replicated ﬁndings support 
the 
validity of our results, despite the methodological limita- 
tions of the study. Both the similarity of our demographics 
to US norms and consistency of our ﬁndings with published 
results suggest that our population-based study may have 
generalizable ﬁndings for many communities throughout 
the US. 

Although relatively few studies have examined unintended 
pregnancy as an adjusted risk factor for prenatal depres- 
sion, most of these studies, which vary substantially in size, 
design and methods, have found unintended and mistimed 
pregnancies to be risk factors for prenatal depression. This 
study, like others, demonstrates substantial effect sizes for 
the relationship between intendedness and depressive 
symptoms while controlling for potential confounders. 
Therefore, a reasonable next step would be to evaluate the 
impact of a trial program that incorporates routine, repe- 
ated screening for depression and associated risks during 
prenatal and 
interconceptional care, plus 
coordinated 
interventions and support on the prevalence of PD, smok- 
ing and other risk behaviors, and unintended and mistimed 
pregnancies. Future research should include prospective 
studies of potential moderators of intendedness for prenatal 
depression, such as race, cultural background, age and 
socioeconomic status, in order to tailor interventions to 
speciﬁc groups of women. 
routine care; 
for example, a validated two-question 
screening tool for depression was found to be feasible and 
effective in clinical practice in several studies [50–54]. 
We also recommend a preventive approach to optimize 
women’s health and readiness for a successful pregnancy 
prior to conception. Preventive screening for risk factors 
that might impact future pregnancies should be a routine 
part of medical care for all women of reproductive age. 
Interventions for smoking and drug use may be more 
successful during preconceptional and interconceptional 
life stages, when stress and anxiety may be lower than 
during pregnancy. Depression too, is treatable and more 
treatment options are available during preconceptional and 
interconceptional stages than during pregnancy. Unin- 
tended and mistimed pregnancies may be addressed 
through family planning consultation and contraception 
services during the post-partum and interconceptional 
periods to prevent recurrence. In summary, a preventive, 
routine approach to risk evaluation and coordinated, evi- 
dence-based interventions for co-occurring risk factors 
throughout a woman’s reproductive lifespan may help 
reduce the burden that unintended pregnancies, maternal 
depression and frequently co-occurring risks place on 
newborn children in our communities.

Our result suggest that unintended pregnancies may be a 
signal that concealed co-morbidities and other risks for 
adverse pregnancy outcomes may be present or emergent 
during the course of the pregnancy. In order to effectively 
intervene and increase the likelihood of positive outcomes 
for current and future pregnancies, providers need to fully 
understand the complex network of risks and mediators 
affecting the mother and fetus, and seek to address them 
using 
evidence-based 
approaches. 



The ﬁrst step in effective intervention requires a fully- 
informed provider; the results of this and other studies 
indicate an urgent need to incorporate routine screening for 
depression, intendedness and associated risk factors such as 
smoking and substance abuse into standard protocols for all 
prenatal care visits. Abbreviated versions of screening tools 
are available and make screenings a feasible practice in
