Background: To investigate the prevalence, socio-cultural and psychosocial risk factors for perinatal depression in Singaporean 
women. 
Method: A prospective cohort of 559 women was interviewed antenatally and at six weeks’ postpartum at a tertiary hospital. 
Women were interviewed for diagnosis of depression using a two-stage design, with a screening questionnaire and diagnostic 
interview. 
Results: Postnatally, a negative confinement experience was associated with depression. Other independent factors included 
poor emotional support, a past history of depression, unplanned pregnancy and perceived potential conflicts with relatives over 
childcare antenatally and dissatisfaction, poor instrumental support postnatally. The prevalence of depression antenatally and 
postnatally was 12.2% and 6.8%, respectively. 
Limitations: Measures of satisfaction with social support were based on self-report; there were high dropout rates at six weeks’ 
postpartum; and other modulating social factors such as pre-existing interpersonal conflicts were not studied. 
Conclusions: Perinatal depression in Singaporean women is common. Contrary to expectations, a negative dconfinementT 
experience is a significant risk factor for postnatal depression, and is not universally welcomed by women. Depression is 
modulated by dissimilar sets of psychosocial factors antenatally and postnatally.

Psychosocial factors play a large part in depression 
(Brown et al., 1996), perhaps even more so during the 
perinatal period than at any other time in a woman’s 
life. Perinatal depression, defined here as depression 
encompassing pregnancy and the first postpartum 
year, has potentially profound negative effects on 
mother and child (Murray and Cooper, 1997). Pills- 
bury (1978) has pointed towards the protective effects 
of close social networks and forms of culturally 
sanctioned social support such as the ritual of 
confinement or bdoing the monthQ in some Asian 
cultures, though recent studies have highlighted that 
ethnoepidemiological factors must also be considered 
(Lee et al., 2004). Singapore is a small South-East 
Asian island–nation that presents the opportunity to 
study a population with easy geographical access to 
extended family, as well as to traditional social 
support through confinement practices. 
In particular, we were interested to study the 
confinement experience and its relation to perinatal 
depression. Singapore is a melting-pot of South-East 
Asian cultures and influences. It has a predominantly 
ethnic Chinese population with significant Malay and 
Indian minorities. The majority of Chinese and 
Indians of childbearing age are third- or fourth- 
generation Singaporeans whose ancestors migrated 
from Southern China and Southern India respectively. 
The Malay population is indigenous and shares the 
same culture as their counterparts in Peninsular 
Malaysia and part of the Riau islands of Indonesia. 
In this study, we defined bconfinementQ to encom- 
pass not only the Chinese traditional practice also 
known as peiyue, but also the local Malay and Indian 
traditions which are intended to increase social 
support for the mother and to aid her recovery from 
childbirth. Chinese confinement traditions dictate that 
the mother is in a state of depletion and needs 
bwarmingQ tonics and food to redress this imbalance. 
Special dietary prescriptions and proscriptions may 
include food that is cooked with ginger, and avoiding 
bcoolingQ things such as cold water or drinks. For 
some women, confinement practices may even in- 
clude bathing in warm water to which certain herbs 
have been added or not washing one’s hair for the 
entire month! In addition to or other than having a 
female relative help with infant care, some Chinese 
women may hire a bconfinement nannyQ for the 
express purpose of cooking the requisite postnatal 
diet and looking after the physical needs of the baby. 
There is booming cottage industry of middle-aged 
Chinese women with practical experience in peiyue 
who have successful careers staying with families a 
month at a time to care for them. Anecdotally, there 
have been reports of clashes between confinement 
caregivers and the new mother over issues such as, 
say, whether or not to breastfeed the child in which 
both parties may come with different sets of cultural 
beliefs and expectations. 



In addition for the woman to not leave the house 
for 
is 
common for Malay women to hire a masseuse who 
provides postnatal massage, apply traditional herbs 
and perform abdominal binding designed to aid 
involution of the uterus and return to the mother’s 
prenatal weight and figure. Indian Hindu women are 
likely to have certain dietary restrictions during the 
postnatal period, together with having special prayers 
and ceremonies designed to protect mother and child 
from spiritual harm. Owing to the assimilation of 
such practices across cultures, various elements of 
these confinement practices have been adopted 
across the different ethnic groups to varying degrees. 
For example, 
is not uncommon for Chinese or 
Indian women to hire a Malay masseuse who will 
come to the house during the confinement month to 
do the postnatal massage and abdominal binding 
during the first few weeks post-delivery. We thus 
sought to study the socio-cultural factors associated 
with and prevalence of perinatal depressive disorders 
in Singaporean women. 


The study design was of a longitudinal cohort study 
of women delivering at a university-affiliated teaching 
hospital in Singapore between July 2002 to December 
2003. Inclusion criteria included all pregnant women 
who were available for the 6-week follow-up period 
after delivery. Potential subjects were approached 
during their antenatal appointments in the obstetric 
clinic and written informed consent was first obtained 
from potential subjects prior to recruitment. Women 
who were subsequently diagnosed as having a 


clinically significant disorder were offered access to 
counselling or psychiatric services. The study was 
approved by the local institutional review board. 
The study had a two-stage design consisting of a 
screening questionnaire followed by a diagnostic 
interview for mood disorders. This was done at both 
initial and follow-up visits. All women received a 
detailed questionnaire that included the well-validated 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (Cox 
et al., 1987). Following a pilot study in which the 
EPDS was validated in all women, 
those scoring 
above a cut-off value of 7 on the EPDS were 
subsequently interviewed by one of 
the authors 
(C.Y.I.C) trained in the use of the mood disorder 
modules of the Structured Clinical 
Interview for 
DSM-IV, non-patient version (SCID-IV) (First et al., 
1994). A Mandarin-version EPDS was adapted from 
the Hong Kong Chinese version of the EPDS (Lee et 
al., 1998) for Chinese-speaking patients. However, the 
original English-language version of the EPDS was 
used instead as the vast majority of respondents 
preferred to be interviewed in English. The six-week 
postnatal visit consisted of a brief questionnaire, the 
EPDS, and the SCID-IV for screen-positive women. If 
the women did not turn up for their six-week postnatal 
visits, self-addressed survey forms were mailed to 
them in addition to telephone reminders if they did not 
reply within a week. 
The mood disorders that were studied in this 
sample included that of major depressive disorder 
(MDD) by DSM-IV criteria (American Psychiatric 
Association, 1994), and minor depressive disorder if 
their symptoms did not reach five out of the nine 
criteria specified for MDD. Given that many women 
had somatic symptoms that were attributable to the 
perinatal state rather than depression, care was taken 
the symptoms enquired about were 
to ensure that 
distinct from the former. If any doubt existed as to the 
cause of the symptoms, then we erred on the side of 
conservatism and it was scored as negative. 
We examined the risk factors that were commonly 
reported in previous studies of postnatal depression. 
These included: 
(a) Demographic and socio-economic factors such 
the number, age and 
as age; marital status; 
gender of other children; educational 
level; 
employment status; household income, and 
whether 
extended family or not; 

(b) Medical history and past psychiatric history of 
depression; obstetric history including previous 
miscarriage or abortion; 
(c) Interpersonal relationships such as marital and 
sexual satisfaction; ratings of emotional and 
practical support (also known as instrumental 
support) by various family members, and 
perceived potential conflicts with other family 
members over childcare; 
(d) Socio-cultural factors such as details of specific 
confinement practices and the subjects’ views 
on whether or not they found them helpful. 
Marital satisfaction was based on a self-reported 
item on the questionnaire using a five-point Likert 
scale. Social support was conceptualised as pertaining 
to emotional support and practical support domains. 
Respondents rated various specific family members 
including one’s partner, the infant’s grandparents, a 
domestic helper if any, and other relatives such as 
siblings, according to the amount of the two types of 
support they could count on, based on a five-point 
Likert scale ranging from bhardly everQ to b usuallyQ. 
These were assigned raw values ranging from 1 to 5, 
yielding a total score of between 5 and 35 for each of 
the emotional and practical support sub-scores and 
between 10 and 70 on the overall support score, with 
70 being the maximum amount of social support 
scored. Inclusion of a domestic helper into the social 
support network was deemed important within the 
Singaporean context, as a substantial number of 
families employ a live-in foreign domestic helper to 
aid in childcare and housework. At six weeks’ 
postpartum, additional questions were asked pertain- 
ing to the degree of satisfaction with the confinement 
experience if any, whether 
the woman was still 
breastfeeding or not, and how many times they had 
brought 
their infants to the doctor on non-routine 
visits (that is, other than for immunizations or well- 
baby visits) over the past six weeks. 
We estimated that a sample size of 500 would give 
a 95% confidence estimate of DSM-IV major depres- 
sive disorder at 10% prevalence with a 2.5% point 
precision. The Obstetrics and Gynaecology depart- 
ment of the National University Hospital of Singapore 
oversees approximately 2500 deliveries per year. 



Statistical analysis was done using the Statistical 
Package for Social Sciences Version 12.0 (SPSS 
v12.0 for Windows XP). Univariate analysis for the 
various independent variables that might be associated 
with perinatal mood disorders was performed using 
the independent Student’s t-test for continuous vari- 
ables and chi-square tests for dichotomous and 
categorical variables. Logistic regression analysis 
was used to estimate the univariate odds ratios and 
their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Multi- 
ple logistic regression analysis was used to explore the 
important independent associations between variables 
and mood disorders after adjustment for confounders. 

During the first phase of the study when 724 
mothers were approached antenatally for recruitment 
into the study, 128 (17.7%) declined to participate in 
the study and 37 (5.1%) were excluded because they 
would not be available during the follow-up period. 
The remaining 559 (77.2%) patients were recruited 
into the study. Limited information about the refusals 
was obtained from their patient registration data. 
However, comparison of baseline data between 
refusals and subjects showed that 
the two groups 
appeared to be comparable in terms of age and ethnic 
group. During the second phase of the study, 278 
mothers gave follow-up interviews at six weeks’ 
postpartum. Of the dropouts, 279 either declined 
follow-up or were un-contactable, one mother had had 
a stillbirth and one mother had died from medical 
complications of pregnancy. Patients who dropped out 
did not differ significantly from patients who were 
available for six-week follow-up in all the studied 
variables except for ethnic group and mean EPDS 
scores (Table 1), with follow-up patients having lower 
EPDS scores than dropouts. 
The mean age of the women was 31 years (F 4.7 
y). 47.2% were Chinese, 24.9% were Malay, 19.0% 
were Indian and 8.9% were classified under other

the women were 
married at the time of recruitment into the study, with 
510 (91.2%) having completed secondary school 
education and above. 224 (40.4%) of the sample 
were university graduates, reflecting a relatively high 
level of education compared with the general popu- 
lation. 342 (61.8%) were either working full-time 
(56.9%) or part-time (4.9%), with the remaining either 
stay-at-home mothers or unemployed. 405 (72.5%) 
women were living with their partners without any 
extended family members in the same household. 
Antenatally, 68 (12.2%) women were diagnosed as 
having a clinically significant mood disorder, of 
which 24 (4.3%) women were diagnosed with major 
depressive disorder and 44 (7.9%) as having minor 
depressive disorder. The rate of depressive disorders 
fell 
to 6.8% at six weeks postpartum, with the 
percentage of mothers diagnosed with MDD remain- 
ing the same at 4.3% (Table 2). Significant factors on 
univariate analysis associated with depression in 
antenatal women are tabulated in Table 3, together 
with the results for the stepwise logistic regression 
modelling. Four factors that were statistically signif- 
icant included an unplanned pregnancy, poor emo- 
tional support, a past history of depression and 
anticipating potential conflicts with family members 
over childcare. Postnatally, logistic regression analysis 
the 
with adjustment for confounding showed that 
presence of depressive disorder was independently

associated with a negative confinement experience, a 
past history of depression, low instrumental support 
and marital dissatisfaction (Table 4). 

We found that while having a negative confine- 
ment experience was associated with the risk of 
having a depressive disorder (Table 4). Antenatally, 
78% of the respondents indicated that 
they were 
intending to undergo confinement, with 79.2% of 
respondents reporting that they had done so at the 
postnatal follow-up. 61.9% expected their confine- 
ment to be a positive experience when interviewed 

antenatally, and 67.2% of 
those who eventually 
underwent confinement reported that they had found 
it a positive experience, with the rest replying bnot 
sureQ or bnoQ. The majority of women described the 
confinement experience to include practices such as 
not 
few weeks’ 
postpartum (69.4%), eating certain foods (66.9%), 
avoiding certain foods (58.6%) and having postnatal 
massage (52.2%). Only one in three women reported 
that 
the confinement experience included having 
someone help with looking after the newborn during 
the day (31.8%) or the night (29.0%). 18% indicated 
that their mothers-in-law would be the main care- 
givers during their confinement; however there was

no association detected between this subset of women 
and increased prevalence of depressive disorders 
(v2 = 1.691, p = 0.193). 

To our knowledge, this is the first study to show 
that confinement practices can be a risk factor for 
postnatal depression, a form of culturally sanctioned 
support which is widely practiced in South-East Asia 
among the Chinese, Malay and Indian populations. 
Furthermore, a third of women surveyed did not 
consider confinement a positive experience. In our 
sample, a positive confinement experience was also 
not associated with a lower risk of developing a 
depressive disorder in our study population. One 
possible explanation of this finding is that the study 
was insufficiently powered to detect a significant 
association between a positive confinement experi- 
ence as a protective factor against depression. 
Another explanation is of course that a positive 
confinement experience in itself is not enough to 
there are many 
ameliorate depression and that 
complex inter-related variables involved. Our inter- 
pretation of 
the data is that confinement per se 
should no longer be counted upon to be a factor that 
might 
lessen or delay the onset of depressive 
(Pillsbury, 1978) and that a negative 
disorder 
confinement experience might actually contribute 
towards a new mother’s distress. Our survey of 
confinement practices that mothers reported also 
indicates that instrumental support such as having a 
family member or bconfinement ladyQ looking after 
the baby during the day and/or night occurred in 
only a third of mothers. Thus though the more 
the confinement experience 
common elements of 
would include dietary proscriptions and prescriptions 
as well as restrictions on a woman leaving the home, 
actual instrumental support was only provided in a 
minority of mothers. The heterogeneity and quality 
of the confinement experience are thus an important 
factor 
to take into account when considering its 
effects on the woman’s postpartum experience. 
A study on Chinese women who had migrated to 
Sydney, Australia also found that 18% of the subjects 
felt ambivalent about 
their confinement, with the 
impression that their adherence to such practices were 
more a result of family or in-law expectations than 
their own wishes (Matthey et al., 2002). This is likely 
to have been the case for the women in our sample as 
well, given that 38% were not sure or did not think 
that confinement would be helpful even during the 
antenatal visit. Future research would be useful in 
elucidating the actual specific components of the 
confinement experience that are perceived as helpful 
and go towards ameliorating or preventing postnatal 
depression. A further clinical implication for physi- 
cians involved in the care of antenatal women would 
be to identify women who do not think confinement 
will be a positive experience, and to possibly involve 
the family early to reduce the potential stress on the 
mother by not insisting that she undergo confinement 
practices that are a stressor rather than a source of 
emotional and instrumental support for her. 
The caregiver during the confinement period was 
another variable we looked at. Lee et al (2004) had 
earlier pointed towards the possibility of this period 
being like a double-edged sword, providing much- 
needed practical support on one hand, and being an 
additional source of interpersonal conflict, particu- 
larly if the mother-in-law was the one responsible for 
looking after the woman during the first postpartum 
month. Given women in confinement, as the name 
implies, are not encouraged to step out of the home 
during the first few weeks postpartum, 
this could 
lead to an increased chance of unwanted interper- 
sonal 
friction with family members, particularly 
among women who did not have a good initial 
relationship with the relative responsible for helping 
out during confinement. We did not detect any 
association between the mother-in-law being in- 
volved in confinement and depressive disorders as 
was suggested in Lee’s ethnoepidemiological study; 
however, our study was not sufficiently powered to 
detect such associations. 
We also did not find any protective effect of having 
one’s mother being involved in the confinement 
experience, unlike an earlier Taiwanese study (Heh 
et al., 2004). However, comparisons between the two 
populations are limited due to differences in the two 
populations’ characteristics. While a Taiwanese wom- 
an might travel back to her parental home for the 
confinement period and receive practical support 
largely from her parents, a woman in Singapore might 
be able to access multiple sources of practical support 


owing to geographical proximity to one’s parents, 
parents-in-law and the ease of hiring a live-in 
domestic helper. This once again highlights the need 
to take the social and cultural context into account 
when considering the effect of cultural and psycho- 
social practices on perinatal depression. 
It can also be argued that postnatal depression 
could also cause a woman to be more likely to 
perceive her confinement experience as a negative 
one. There may indeed be some women who fall into 
this group. However, about four in ten women in the 
their confinement 
sample had misgivings about 
experience being a positive one even before they 
had delivered, and this would have included women 
who were not depressed prior to delivery. While a 
negative confinement experience is obviously not the 
only factor involved in postnatal depression, it may 
very well be the proverbial straw that breaks the 
camel’s back in some cases. 


the relationship between the 
confinement experience and postnatal depression is 
a complex one, the specific pathways of which this 
study has picked up but 
is unable to address 
adequately. Future qualitative studies would be 
needed to further explore and elucidate the nature of 
the relationship between depression and the confine- 
ment experience. Ultimately, what is important is that 
a woman undergoing a confinement experience 
should not be simplistically assumed to enjoy it and 
benefit from it, and that it can be a source both of 
much-needed support as well as stress. 
4.1. Emotional and instrumental support across 
delivery 
After controlling for various factors, we found a 
strong statistical association between the presence of 
depressive disorder and emotional support antenatally. 
Postnatally, instrumental support became more highly 
associated with depressive disorder than emotional 
support. This is perhaps not surprising, given the 
importance of practical help required in caring for a 
newborn infant. Furthermore, poor marital satisfaction 
was independently associated with depression at six 
weeks’ postpartum. It would thus appear that antenatal 
depression and postnatal depression share dissimilar 
risk factors with diverse relevance during the antenatal 
and postnatal period. 

We found that the prevalence of antenatal depres- 
sive disorders in our sample of women was comparable 
to that of Western populations (O’Hara and Swain, 
1996; Gorman et al., 2004). There was a drop in 
prevalence rates of depression after delivery as has 
been described in other studies (Evans et al., 2001). 
Strikingly, prevalence rates of major depressive disor- 
der remained stable as the declines in prevalence rates 
of depressive disorder postnatally were largely due to a 
drop-off in minor depressive disorder prevalence rates. 

One limitation of the study was the high dropout 
rate during the second phase of the study. This is 
perhaps not surprising, given that high rates of 
refusals in excess of 50% and dropouts of up to 
36% were also seen in other studies of perinatal 
women (Morris-Rush et al., 2003). These dropout and 
refusal rates may thus reflect a widespread problem in 
the perinatal period where there are extra demands 
placed on the woman’s time due to preparing for the 
arrival and caring for the new infant. Patients who 
dropped out of the study also had significantly higher 
EPDS scores, suggesting a possibly higher rate of 
depression in this group. Another factor to consider in 
our study is that we also offered screen-positive 
women referrals for counselling and towards appro- 
priate channels of help. It is likely that this would 
have resulted in lower rates of perinatal depression 
than if no interventions were offered. However, the 
take-up rate of women who were depressed and 
agreed to be referred to social workers or psychiatrists 
for treatment was extremely low. Thus on balance, our 
reported rate is unlikely to reflect a positive bias 
towards reporting psychological distress. 
A further limitation of the study was that although 
care was taken to diagnose women who screened as 
positive on the EPDS with a diagnostic interview 
schedule using the SCID, a small proportion of 
women with low EPDS scores (false negatives) may 
actually have had clinically diagnosable depressive 
disorder. Including these women in the control group 
of non-depressed women would thus bias the 
estimates of association towards the null. 


A note also needs to be made about the clinical 
versus statistical significance of a negative confine- 
ment experience and its association with postnatal 
depression. While statistically significant, the confi- 
dence intervals were very large, largely due to the 
small absolute numbers of postnatally depressed 
women in the six-week postnatal sample. Given that 
the prevalence of depression is likely to be under- 
estimated in the follow-up sample, we think that 
this association is 
likely to be clinically 
significant. 

Other possible factors that might modulate psy- 
chosocial support were also not addressed in this 
study. For example, although the majority of women 
lived in nuclear family units in their own house- 
holds, governmental policies encouraging young 
couples to live within a kilometre of their parents 
and good transport 
the woman’s 
parents or parents-in-law could be living in close 
proximity and are able to provide reliable practical 
support 
the new parents. Also, pre-existing 
interpersonal conflicts were not assessed in this 
study as well. 



Perinatal depression in Singaporean women is 
though it appears that antenatal and 
common, 
postnatal depression are modulated by dissimilar sets 
of psychosocial factors. Some of these factors are 
well known, such as poor marital satisfaction, 
unplanned pregnancy and a past history of depres- 
sion. Clinicians should thus be alert 
to enquiring 
about women’s emotional as well as instrumental 
support during the perinatal period, bearing in mind 
that different aspects of such support may emerge as 
differentially important depending on the time-point 
the woman is seen at. 
Contrary to expectations, we also found that a 
negative confinement experience actually increases 
the risk of postnatal depression. The nature of the 
confinement experience is complex and heteroge- 
nous, possibly involving factors that can increase 
postnatal depression by increasing unwelcome inter- 
personal contact or are perceived as an obligation or 
series of restrictions which the mother does not find 
helpful. It should certainly no longer be taken at 
face value as a uniformly helpful practice. Future 
research could elucidate which particular aspects of 
the confinement experience are helpful, rather than 
contributing towards depressive disorder, and to 
study interventions that could tip the balance in 
favour of the mother’s psychiatric and emotional 
well-being. 



2. Culturally mandated social support is a complex 
phenomenon which cannot be assumed to be 
always helpful to the mother; 
3. Prevalence rates of depression drop after delivery, 
mainly accounted for by a reduction in the 
prevalence of minor depressive disorder. 

1. High dropout rates at 6 weeks’ postnatal follow-up; 
2. Only self-report measures of psychosocial support 

3. Other possible factors that might modulate psy- 
chosocial support such as proximity to extended 
family and pre-existing interpersonal conflicts were 
not assessed.
