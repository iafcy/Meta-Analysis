The purpose of this paper was to examine the relationship between unintended pregnancy and 
intimate partner violence (IPV) before and during pregnancy among Latinas. A cross-sectional 
interview measuring pregnancy intent, IPV, and acculturation, using the Acculturation Rating 
Scale for Mexican Americans (ARSMA-II), was conducted among Latina women in their 2nd or 
3rd trimester of pregnancy at clinics in Los Angeles (n = 313). Overall, 44% of women reported 
an unintended pregnancy. The prevalence of physical (any) and emotional (only) abuse 12 months 
before pregnancy was 11% and 22%, respectively. Although both types of IPV decreased during 
pregnancy (10% and 19%, respectively), most reports of physical IPV during pregnancy (53%) 
were among women who did not report physical abuse before pregnancy. After adjusting for other 
factors, physical IPV before pregnancy was not associated with unintended pregnancy (adjusted 
OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.40, 2.16). The prevalence of unintended pregnancy was highest (76%) 
among highly acculturated Latinas. However, when an unintended pregnancy occurred among less 
acculturated Latinas, who comprised the majority of the sample (n = 270), it was associated with 
greater risk of physical IPV during pregnancy (unadjusted OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.06, 6.23); 
although the confidence interval included one after adjusting for other factors (adjusted OR = 2.79; 
95% CI = 0.98, 7.92). An unintended pregnancy may have a unique impact on relationships in 
the context of Latino culture, where family and pregnancy are highly valued. Pregnancy often 
creates an opportunity for providers to discuss issues related to abuse and family planning with 
women who do not regularly access care. The results from this study may be used to increase the 
cultural sensitivity with which violence and reproductive health are addressed among the diverse 
population of Latinas when they connect with prenatal services.

Intimate partner violence (IPV), most often perpetrated against a woman by a current 
or former male partner, is recognized as a widespread public health issue in the United 
States (Tjaden & Thoennes, 2000). In addition to physical and sexual abuse, IPV often 
entails emotional abuse, intimidation, financial control, coercion, threats, and isolation. 
Undoubtedly, the climate of fear such abuse must create imposes a significant constraint 
on contraceptive use and family planning, contributing to a number of adverse reproductive 
health outcomes among women who are victims (Amaro, 1995; Pallitto, Campbell, & 
O’Campo, 2005; Wingood, DiClemente, & Raj, 2000). Unintended pregnancy is one such 
outcome, and in turn, a mistimed or unwanted pregnancy could create or aggravate tension 
in a relationship and be an important determinant of whether abuse continues to occur 
during pregnancy. Indeed, an association between IPV and unintended pregnancy has been 
reported in the United States and internationally (Castro, Peek-Asa, Garcia, Ruiz, & Kraus, 
2003; Gazmararian et al., 1995; Gessner & Perham-Hester, 1998; Goodwin, Gazmararian, 
Johnson, Gilbert, & Saltzman, 2000; Leung, Leung, Lam, & Ho, 1999; Martin et al., 1999; 
Pallitto & O’Campo, 2004; Sahin & Sahin, 2003; Saltzman, Johnson, Gilbert, & Goodwin, 
2003). 
Family planning and childbearing all too often occur in the context of a violent relationship, 
as an estimated 5% of pregnant women in the United States report IPV (Saltzman et al., 
2003). It is important that health care providers and public health professionals understand 
the cultural contexts surrounding these relationships when offering care and designing 
violence prevention and reproductive health programs (de la Torre & Estrada, 2001; Flores- 
Ortiz, 1993, 1994; Torres, 1987, 1991; Warwick, 1997), especially in California, where 
more than half of all births occur among the Latina population. Although Latinas are at 
higher risk for both IPV and unintended pregnancy than other ethnic groups (Chandra, 
Martinez, Mosher, Abma, & Jones, 2005; Garcia, Hurwitz, & Kraus, 2005; Giachello, 
2001; Henshaw, 1998; Jones, Darroch, & Henshaw, 2002; Raine, Minnis, & Padian, 2003; 
Sangi-Haghpeykar, Ali, Posner, & Poindexter, 2006; Sorenson & Telles, 1991), data on 
family planning and IPV among Latinas living in the United States are scant, and even fewer 
studies have examined these issues among subgroups of the Latina population. 
Acculturation, for instance, is a strong predictor of health outcomes in Latino populations 
and has been defined as “those phenomena, which result when groups of individuals having 
different cultures come into continuous first-hand contact, with subsequent changes in the 
original cultural patterns of either or both groups” (Redfield, Linton, & Herskovits, 1936, 
p. 149). Measures of acculturation have been used to identify populations at higher risk 
of certain health outcomes and to determine how public health programs are designed and 
best targeted to specific groups. Many public health prevention programs in the United 
States focus on the individual, as opposed to the family, which may inhibit Latinas who 
are more family oriented from participating (Champion, 1996; Diaz Olavarrieta & Sotelo, 
1996; Flores-Ortiz, 1993; Unger & Molina, 1998). At the same time, highly acculturated 
Latinas may benefit from existing public health preventative programs in institutions, such 
as health care facilities and schools. Several studies, for instance, have found that Latinas 
who are more highly acculturated have higher rates of IPV compared with Latinas who 


 


are less acculturated and who have greater ties to the Latino values of family and children 
(Garcia et al., 2005; Sorenson & Telles, 1991). 
Attitudes and behaviors related to family planning also differ within the Latina population 
living in the United States. Latina women have higher birth rates and lower rates of 
contraceptive use than other ethnic groups (Chandra et al., 2005; Giachello, 2001; Henshaw, 
1998; Jones et al., 2002; Raine et al., 2003). Researchers have offered explanations for 
these trends—a culture in which the male is dominant, religious beliefs, lack of access to 
health care, low self-efficacy in using condoms and birth control pills, and a preference 
for sons over daughters may all play a role in contributing to low contraceptive use 
and unintended pregnancy among Latinas (Gibson & Lanz, 1991; Kost, Singh, Vaughan, 
Trussell, & Bankole, 2008; Ortiz & Casas, 1990; Russell, Williams, Farr, Schwab, & 
Plattsmier, 1993; Unger & Molina, 1997, 2000). If cultural barriers inhibit contraceptive use, 
one might expect that highly acculturated Latinas would be more likely to use contraceptives 
and be at decreased risk of unintended pregnancy. However, the evidence is mixed. Several 
studies have found greater acculturation is associated with more favorable beliefs about 
using condoms, more consistent contraceptive use, and a preference for smaller families, 
suggesting highly acculturated Latinas would be less likely to have an unintended pregnancy 
(Amaro, 1988; Marin, Tschann, Gomez, & Kegeles, 1993; Norris & Ford, 1994; Romo, 
Berenson, & Segars, 2004; Sabogal, Perez-Stable, Otero-Sabogal, & Hiatt, 1995; Sorenson, 
1985). At the same time, other studies have found greater acculturation is associated with 
an increase in sexual risk behaviors that lead to unintended pregnancy, particularly among 
younger populations who engage in other health-risk behaviors, such as drug and alcohol use 
(Afable-Munsuz & Brindis, 2006). Reproductive health behaviors among Latinas are then 
complex and are further complicated in the context of a violent relationship. 
The purpose of this article is to examine the relationship between unintended pregnancy 
and IPV before and during pregnancy among Latinas in Los Angeles, California. We 
hypothesize that women who report IPV before pregnancy are more likely to report an 
unintended pregnancy and that unintended pregnancy is associated with abuse by an intimate 
partner during pregnancy. Because the Latina population living in the United States is 
diverse in terms of acculturation and different groups may require different intervention 
approaches, we also examine the association of acculturation with unintended pregnancy 
and IPV around the time of pregnancy, and we assess whether the relationship between 
pregnancy intent and abuse differs according to level of acculturation. Pregnancy is a time 
when women connect regularly with health care, creating an opportunity for providers to 
discuss issues related to abuse and family planning. Therefore, these data will strengthen the 
evidence base supporting the adoption of IPV screening and referral programs and increase 
the cultural sensitivity with which these programs address violence and reproductive health 
among the diverse Latina population. 


Data for this analysis come from a cross-sectional study conducted between 1998 and 
2000 by researchers at the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center at the 


 


University of California, Los Angeles. The study was initially designed to assess the 
relationship between acculturation and IPV among Latina women. The methods, described 
briefly in what follows, can also be found in several prior publications (Castro, Peek-Asa, 
Garcia, Ruiz, & Kraus, 2003; Garcia, Hurwitz, & Kraus, 2005; Peek-Asa, Garcia, McArthur, 
& Castro, 2002). The institutional review board of the University of California, Los Angeles, 
approved the research. 

All women attending gynecological and obstetrical appointments at five clinics serving low- 
income populations in Los Angeles were approached to participate in the study. The clinics 
were chosen because they represented areas with large Latino populations. Each woman 
who agreed to participate gave informed consent and a trained female bilingual interviewer 
administered a questionnaire in the participant’s choice of English or Spanish. A total of 
483 women who were approached and agreed to participate in the study self-identified as 
Latina/Hispanic. This analysis includes all pregnant women in their second or third trimester 
who self-identified as Latina/Hispanic and had a current partner (n = 313), all of whom were 
heterosexual. 

Women were asked about pregnancy intent using the question, “Before you got pregnant, 
were you thinking of having a baby?” Physical, sexual, and emotional abuses by an intimate 
partner 12 months before and during pregnancy were then measured using a screening 
instrument validated among Latina populations (Peek-Asa, Garcia, McArthur, & Castro, 
2002). The scale contained 12 questions on types of physical violence (e.g., “Purposely 
pushed you?” or “Hit you with a hand or fist?”), 13 questions on forms of psychological 
violence (e.g., “Humiliated or scorned you?” or “Told you that you are unattractive or 
ugly?”), and 3 questions on sexual violence (e.g., “Demanded sex when you were not 
willing?”). Women who gave an affirmative response to any item on the physical, sexual, 
or emotional subscales were categorized as having reported that type of violence. Because 
sexual violence is a form of physical violence, and because the number of women who 
reported sexual violence was low, the physical and sexual violence variables were collapsed. 
Violence before and during pregnancy was then analyzed using a variable with three 
mutually exclusive categories—any physical abuse with or without emotional abuse, only 
emotional abuse, and no abuse. 
The respondent’s level of acculturation was measured using the first scale of the 
Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican-Americans-II (ARSMA-II; Cuellar, Arnold, & 
Maldonado, 1995). Capable of measuring orientation toward Mexican and Anglo culture 
independently, the ARSMA-II is one of the most comprehensive and widely used validated 
scales for measuring the process of acculturation in United States. The scale contains 30 
questions, from which a continuous score is calculated and categorized into five levels: 1 = 
very Mexican oriented, 2 = Mexican oriented to approximately balanced biculturally, 3 = 
s 
ghtly Anglo oriented bicultural, 4 = strongly Anglo oriented, and 5 = very assimilated, or 
i 
l 
Anglicized. In this analysis the third, fourth, and fifth categories were collapsed because a 
small number of women were Anglo oriented. 


 



The distribution of variables related to the demographic characteristics of the respondent, 
her partner, her reproductive history, and reported IPV prior to pregnancy were examined 
according to reported IPV during pregnancy using cross tabulations and percentages. Next, 
multivariate logistic regressions in SAS Version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) were 
conducted to examine the relationship between unintended pregnancy and IPV before and 
during pregnancy. Acculturation was examined as a covariate in the models, and then 
regression models were stratified to examine differences according to level of acculturation. 
Other covariates were evaluated as potential confounders by examining their association 
with IPV and unintended pregnancy and included in final models on the basis of the degree 
to which they affected the associations of interest and based on prior knowledge. Odds ratios 
and 95% confidence intervals were used to interpret the results. 


Overall, 30% of the respondents were under 21 years of age, 48% had not completed any 
high school, 87% reported a monthly household income of less than or equal to $1,500, 
and 71% were currently married or living with a partner (Table 1). The vast majority of 
the respondents had partners who were older than 21 years (86%), and most partners (83%) 
were born outside of the United States. Regarding the women’s reproductive histories, 42% 
had been sexually active with more than one partner, 54% had been pregnant before, and 9% 
reported having had an abortion. 

Overall, 10% of the women reported physical abuse during pregnancy and another 19% 
reported emotional abuse (Table 1). Compared with women who reported no abuse, women 
who reported physical or emotional abuse during pregnancy were more likely to be younger 
than 21 years of age (40% and 37% vs. 27%), more educated (73% and 60% vs. 47%), and 
not married to or living with a current partner (43% and 38% vs. 25%). They were also more 
likely to have a partner younger than 21 years of age (27% and 20% vs. 10%) who was born 
in the United States (20% and 25% vs. 14%) and to report having had more that one sexual 
partner (60% and 53% vs. 36%). 
IPV before pregnancy was a strong predictor of abuse during pregnancy (Table 1). 
Compared with women who reported no abuse during pregnancy, women who reported 
physical or emotional abuse were more likely to report the same type of IPV before 
pregnancy (47% vs. 4% and 57% vs. 12%, respectively) At the same time, the majority 
of women who reported physical IPV during pregnancy did not report they were physically 
abused before becoming pregnant; in other words, approximately 23% of women reported 
that violence escalated from emotional abuse before pregnancy to physical abuse during 
pregnancy, and another 30% reported physical abuse started during pregnancy when no 
abuse occurred before pregnancy. However, many women also reported an improvement 
during pregnancy. The majority (56% or n = 19) of women who reported physical IPV 
before pregnancy did not report physical IPV during pregnancy. 


 



The majority of the women fell into the lowest level of acculturation on the ARSMA-II, 
which corresponds to very Mexican oriented (63%; Table 2). One fourth (25%) were 
categorized into the second lowest level (Mexican oriented to approximately balanced 
culturally). Only 12% of women fell into the highest levels of acculturation, indicating 
i 
b 
greater orientation to Anglo culture. 

Overall, 44% of the women reported an unintended pregnancy (Table 2). When we examined 
physical IPV before pregnancy in relation to unintended pregnancy, the unadjusted odds 
ratio (OR) was 1.62 (95% CI = 0.78, 3.37), and we did not observe an association after 
adjusting for the age of the respondent, partner’s age, marital status, number of sexual 
partners, and level of acculturation—the adjusted OR was 0.92 (95% CI = 0.40, 2.16). 
However, women who reported emotional abuse before pregnancy did differ with respect to 
pregnant intent after adjusting for these same factors; women who reported emotional IPV 
before pregnancy were less likely than women who were not abused to report an unintended 
pregnancy (adjusted OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.26, 0.97). 
When level of acculturation was examined in relation to unintended pregnancy, the highest 
acculturated Latinas (ARSMA Levels III-V) were more likely to report their pregnancy was 
unintended when compared with the least acculturated Latinas (ARSMA Level I; unadjusted 
OR = 5.54; 95% CI = 2.48, 12.36; Table 2). However, after adjusting for other factors, 
including the respondent’s age, partner’s age, marital status, and number of sexual partners, 
the confidence interval crossed 1 (adjusted OR = 2.24; 95% CI = 0.86, 5.85). It did not 
appear that moderate acculturation (ARSMA Level II) was associated with unintended 
pregnancy (adjusted OR = 1.15; 95% CI = 0.62, 2.12). We also examined the association 
between IPV before pregnancy and unintended pregnancy within levels of acculturation, but 
no differences were found. 

When we examined unintended pregnancy in relation to physical IPV during pregnancy, 
the unadjusted OR was 2.12 (95% CI = 0.97, 4.61; Table 3). The association became 
stronger after adjusting for other factors, primarily due to the addition of acculturation to 
the model. After adjusting for level of acculturation, as well as age, education, and IPV 
before pregnancy, women who reported an unintended pregnancy were more likely to report 
physical IPV during pregnancy compared with women who intended pregnancy (adjusted 
OR = 2.80; 95% CI = 1.01, 7.73) An association between pregnancy intent and emotional 
IPV during pregnancy was not observed. 
When the relationship between level of acculturation and IPV during pregnancy was 
examined, physical IPV during pregnancy was more common among women who were 
highly acculturated (ARMSA Levels III-V; unadjusted OR = 3.19; 95% CI = 1.09, 9.29; 
Table 3). However, we found no association in the multivariate model, which included the 
respondent’s age, education, and IPV before pregnancy (adjusted OR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.17, 
3.80). The same was true when we examined the relationship between moderate levels of 


 


acculturation (ARSMA Level II) and physical IPV during pregnancy (adjusted OR = 0.94; 
95% CI = 0.28, 3.16). 
Finally, we examined the relationship between unintended pregnancy and physical IPV 
within levels of acculturation (Table 4). Among Mexican-oriented women only (ARSMA 
Levels I-II), unintended pregnancy was associated with greater risk of physical IPV during 
pregnancy (unadjusted OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.06, 6.23); although the confidence interval 
widened to include one after adjusting for other factors (adjusted OR = 2.79; 95% CI = 
0.98, 7.92). In comparison, it did not appear that unintended pregnancy was associated with 
an increase in the risk of physical IPV during pregnancy among Latinas who were highly 
acculturated (ARSMA Levels III-V; unadjusted OR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.09, 4.49), although 
the number of women falling into this group was small. 

It has been noted that the climate of fear and control surrounding violent relationships 
constrains women’s agency to use contraceptives, leading to a variety of adverse 
reproductive health outcomes (Amaro, 1995; Wingood et al., 2000). This may be especially 
true among certain Latino populations where there is a strong male patriarchy (Pallitto 
& O’Campo, 2005). Studies have shown that IPV before pregnancy is associated with 
increased risk of one such outcome, an unintended pregnancy (Gazmararian et al., 1995; 
Gessner & Perham-Hester, 1998; Goodwin et al., 2000; Saltzman et al., 2003). 
In this study, however, physical abuse by an intimate partner before pregnancy was not 
associated with pregnancy intent after controlling for age, marital status, acculturation, and 
sexual history. The differences between our findings and past research may be because this 
study was conducted among a U.S. Latina population, and the majority of the women in 
our sample were acculturated very little to U.S. culture. Although less acculturated Latinas 
may come from stronger male patriarchies that inhibit contraceptive use, they may be less 
likely to use contraception because of other reasons, such as a preference for larger families 
and religious beliefs (Gibson & Lanz, 1991; Romo et al., 2004). It is also possible some 
women reported they were thinking of getting pregnant, in spite of abuse, because they place 
a high importance on having children. At the same time, emotional abuse before pregnancy 
was associated with a decreased risk of unintended pregnancy. Because few studies have 
examined emotional abuse, these findings need further evaluation. However, women who are 
emotionally abused could intend a pregnancy, expecting a child will have a positive impact 
on their situation. 
For many women who reported physical abuse before pregnancy—more than 50%—the 
violence stopped during pregnancy. At the same time, more than half of all reports of 
physical IPV during pregnancy indicated the abuse started after conception, which provides 
further empirical support that batterer behavior often becomes worse during pregnancy. 
Although little is known about what makes violence stop or start during pregnancy, our 
results suggest that unintended pregnancy may be associated with the occurrence of physical 
violence during pregnancy. That an unintended pregnancy could be an important determinant 
of whether abuse continues to occur or begins during pregnancy has received very little 


 


attention in the literature. Furthermore, the association between unintended pregnancy and 
physical abuse during pregnancy persisted among the least acculturated women. Although 
unintended pregnancies were less common among these women, when an unplanned or 
unwanted pregnancy does occur among women who are more Mexican oriented, it could 
have a negative impact on their relationship in the context of Latino culture, where family 
and pregnancy are highly valued. 
Understanding unintended pregnancy and IPV around the time of pregnancy in the context 
of Latino culture is important for developing public health programs that target specific 
groups of Latina women. For instance, Latinas who are highly acculturated and those who 
were born or raised in the United States tend to resemble other non-Latina populations, such 
as African American women. Highly acculturated Latinas may then benefit from existing 
preventative programs in institutions, such as health care facilities and schools, which tend 
to use approaches where the individual, as opposed to the family network, is the main focus 
of the intervention. In comparison, Latinas who have acculturated very little or none at 
all to the U.S. culture may require slightly different approaches. The family, “la familia,” 
rather than the individual, are most important (Champion, 1996; Diaz Olavarrieta & Sotelo, 
1996; Flores-Ortiz, 1993; Unger & Molina, 1998). Therefore, it is critical that the family or 
kin group is acknowledged in health promotion programs, through the use of “promotoras” 
(e.g., peer counselors), for example, to share health information. In this study, unintended 
pregnancy was less common among less acculturated Latinas, but this issue may be hard to 
discuss in communities that place a high value on pregnancy and family. As such, it may 
be even more important that health messages about pregnancy intent and IPV come from a 
trusted community source, such as a promotora. In addition, during pregnancy many Latinas 
have more frequent contact with the health care system and those who are less acculturated 
may not feel particularly comfortable in these settings. It is, therefore, critical that prenatal 
care providers are also aware of and sensitive to the differences that exist among the Latina 
population when discussing issues related to family planning and abuse. 

Although this study has strengths, it also has several limitations. Women sampled at the 
end of pregnancy may not represent the population of women who received prenatal care 
from the clinics during earlier stages of their pregnancy. Abused women are more likely 
to have complications during pregnancy (Boy & Salihu, 2004; Coker, Sanderson, & Dong, 
2004). If abuse led to fetal or maternal death or inhibited prenatal care, the population of 
women sampled in their second or third trimester would contain less abused women than a 
population sampled earlier during the pregnancy. 
Because of the cross-sectional nature of this study, the results should also be interpreted 
with caution. Although the respondents were asked to report on abuse and pregnancy intent 
at distinct time points, their answers were subject to recall bias. It is possible that violence 
during pregnancy could have led women to give less favorable reports on intending a 
pregnancy than they would have given if they were asked the same question directly after 
finding out they were pregnant. In addition, our analysis of pregnancy intent is limited 
by the fact that we lacked information on use of and access to contraceptives, as well as 


 


whether the unintended pregnancy was mistimed or unwanted. Finally, we primarily focused 
our interpretation of results on point estimates and the magnitude and direction of the 
associations of interest. However, we recognize that some odds ratios did not reach statistical 
significance, as some 95% confidence intervals crossed the null value of 1. Therefore, 
readers may want to interpret nonsignificant results with greater caution. 

The results from this study contribute to a better understanding of unintended pregnancy 
and IPV among Latinas in the United States. Unintended pregnancy was associated with 
the occurrence of physical violence during pregnancy, and many women who were abused— 
more than 50%—reported that the physical violence started during pregnancy. Women who 
were more highly acculturated were at greater risk of unintended pregnancy; however, the 
majority of women sampled were acculturated very little to the United States, and when an 
unintended pregnancy did occur among women with stronger ties to Latino culture, it was 
associated with physical abuse during pregnancy. It is our hope that these results can be 
used by future studies to further examine family-planning practices in the context of violent 
relationships and in the context of the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that exist among 
Latino populations living in the United States. It is recommended that violence prevention 
and reproductive health programs targeted at Latinas are sensitive to the diversity that exists 
among these women in terms of acculturation.
