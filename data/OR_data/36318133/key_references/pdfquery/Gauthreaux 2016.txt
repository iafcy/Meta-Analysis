Abstract 
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a form of major depressive disorder affecting approximately 13% of women worldwide. Unintended 
pregnancies, reaching close to 50% of the pregnancies in the United States, have become a major health concern. While many 
physiologic and psychosocial causes have been analyzed, few studies have examined the relationship between unintended 
pregnancy and symptoms of PPD. 
A cross-sectional study was conducted using surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Pregnancy 
Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) from 2009 to 2011. The PRAMS population-based random sample included women 
who have had recent live births and is representative of 78% of the United States population. The chi-squared test was used to 
examine bivariate associations. Binary logistic regression was utilized to study unadjusted and adjusted associations between PPD 
and pregnancy intendedness, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics of mothers in the sample. Multicollinearity in 
the adjusted model was evaluated using variance inﬂation factors. Sampling weights were used to account for PRAMS’ complex 
sampling design. 
Of the 110,231 mothers included in the sample, only 32.3% reported desiring the pregnancy at the time of conception. Women 
with pregnancies categorized as mistimed: desired sooner, mistimed: desired later, or unwanted were 20% (adjusted odds ratio 
[AOR] = 1.2; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 1.1–1.3), 30% (AOR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.2–1.4), and 50% (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3–1.7) more 
likely to experience symptoms of PPD, respectively, compared to women with desired pregnancies. Other factors found to be 
associated with experiencing symptoms of PPD were a gestational age of <27 weeks (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 2.5–4.0), having a 
previous history of depression (AOR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.6–2.0), and being abused during or before pregnancy (AOR = 1.6; 95% CI: 
1.4–2.0). 
We found that women with mistimed or unwanted pregnancies were more likely to experience symptoms of PPD. Our ﬁndings 
support the current US Preventive Services Task Force and American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations for an integrated 
approach to screening for depression, aiding in the maximization of intervention and early referral for women at risk for PPD.

Postpartum depression (PPD), or depression experienced after 
pregnancy, is a serious illness that puts the well-being of both 
mother and baby at risk. It is highly prevalent among new mothers, 
affecting nearly 13% of women.[1] It is also a highly stigmatized 
condition, although recent high-proﬁle cases have drawn signiﬁ- 
cant media attention to the issue. Given its stigmatized nature, 
as well as both the short-term and long-term implications for 
mother and child, effective screening for PPD by general medical 
practitioners is an essential public health intervention. 
PPD is a term that has suffered from lack of clarity and is not 
clearly operationally deﬁned. The 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) utilizes a 
broader term of peripartum depression, encompassing depression 
in which the onset occurred during or within the ﬁrst 4 weeks of 
pregnancy, as a form of major depressive disorder. A person who 
suffers from a major depressive episode must either have a 
depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities 
consistently for at least a 2-week period. A major depressive 
episode is also characterized by the presence of 5 or more of these 
symptoms: a depressed mood; markedly diminished interest or 
pleasure in all, or almost all, activities; signiﬁcant unintentional 
weight loss or gain; 
insomnia or hypersomnia; agitation or 
psychomotor retardation; fatigue or loss of energy; feelings of 
worthlessness or excessive guilt; diminished ability to think, 
concentrate, or make decisions; and recurrent 
thoughts of 
death.[2] However, within primary care settings, it is likely not 
possible to make a formal diagnosis of peripartum depression. 
For primary care physicians, obstetricians, and pediatricians 
working with new mothers, attention should be paid to screening 
for potential symptoms of PPD, such as feeling depressed, 
hopeless, or slowed down, so that appropriate referrals for 
mental health services can be made. 
Unintended pregnancy is also a serious public health concern in 
the United States, which has rates higher than most other 
industrialized nations. It has been estimated that nearly half of all 
pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and poorer 
women are disproportionately affected.[3] Women who experi- 
ence unintended pregnancies are less likely to receive adequate 
prenatal care or breastfeed, and are more likely to engage in 
unhealthy activities during pregnancy and have low birth weight 
babies.[3] Unintended pregnancies are described as either 
unwanted or mistimed. An unwanted pregnancy is deﬁned as 
occurring when no children or no additional children are wanted 
by the mother. Mistimed pregnancies include those occurring 
earlier or later than desired.[3,4] 
While many physiologic and psychosocial causes of PPD have 
been explored, few studies have examined the relationship 
between pregnancy intendedness and experiencing symptoms of 
PPD.[5–12] To our knowledge, no such national studies within the 
United States have been conducted. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the association between pregnancy intendedness and 
symptoms of PPD. We explored this association using a 
nationally representative sample available from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention’s Pregnancy Risk Assessment 
Monitoring System (PRAMS).[13] 


This secondary data analysis utilized data from PRAMS.[13] 
PRAMS uses a complex survey design in order to capture 

adequate information from high-risk populations.[14] Forty states 
and New York City participate in the annual survey, representing 
78% of live births in the United States.[13] All women with live 
births within the surveillance period are eligible for inclusion. 
Data collected from 2009 to 2011 using the PRAMS Phase 6 
Core Questionnaire were included in this study.[15] 
Pregnancy intendedness was measured by participants’ answers 
to the question, “Thinking back to just before you got pregnant 
with your new baby, how did you feel about becoming pregnant?” 
Following the deﬁnitions utilized by Finer and Zolna,[3] pregnancy 
intendedness for those answering “I wanted to be pregnant then” 
was categorized as Desired; “I wanted to be pregnant sooner” as 
mistimed: desired sooner; “I wanted to be pregnant later” as 
mistimed: desired later; and “I did not want to be pregnant then or 
at any time in the future” as unwanted. The outcome of interest was 
deﬁned by participants’ answers to survey questions related to self- 
assessed experience with symptoms of PPD. Women were asked if 
after the birth of their child they felt any of the following symptoms: 
down, depressed, or sad; hopeless; or slowed down. If the 
respondent indicated they had experienced any of the 3 symptoms, 
they were asked to rate the frequency of experiencing the feeling as 
never, rarely, sometimes, often, or always.[15] Women indicating 
they sometimes, often, or always experienced any of 
these 
symptoms were classiﬁed as experiencing symptoms of PPD; those 
indicating they rarely or never experienced all 3 symptoms were 
classiﬁed as not having PPD. Although the DSM-5 utilizes the 
broader term of peripartum depression, this study focused solely on 
depression arising after delivery, excluding women whose depres- 
sion started prior to delivery.[2] 
Potential confounders included maternal age (<20, 20–34, and 
≥35 years); ethnicity (Hispanic and non-Hispanic); race (White, 
Black, and other); marital status (married and unmarried); 
total annual household income (<$10,000, $10,000–$19,999, 
$20,000–$49,999, and >$50,000); level of education (less than 
high school, high school, and more than high school); gestational age 
at birth (<28, 28–33, 34–36, and ≥37 weeks); medical history of 
depression (no and yes); abuse during or before pregnancy (no and 
yes); and presence of stressors in the mother’s life (none, 1–2 stressors, 
3–5 stressors, and 6 or more stressors). Stressors included: having an 
ill family member; separation or divorce from partner; recent move; 
homelessness; respondent lost a job; partner lost a job; arguing with 
partner more than usual; partner did not desire pregnancy; unable to 
pay bills; being in a physical ﬁght; respondent or partner went to jail; 
someone close to the respondent had a problem with drugs or 
drinking; or someone close to the respondent died. 

Descriptive statistics included examining frequency distributions 
of the categorical variables and assessing for missing data. We 
examined bivariate associations using the chi-squared test. Binary 
logistic regression was utilized to study unadjusted and adjusted 
associations between PPD and pregnancy intendedness, as well as 
other demographic and clinical characteristics of mothers in the 
sample. The adjusted model included maternal age, ethnicity, 
race, marital status, total household income, level of education, 
gestational age, medical history of depression, abuse during or 
before pregnancy, and the presence of stressors in the mother’s 
life. Multicollinearity in the adjusted model was evaluated using 
variance inﬂation factors. Sampling weights were used to account 
for PRAMS’ complex sampling design.[14] A P value < 0.05 was 
considered statistically signiﬁcant, and 95% conﬁdence intervals 
(CIs) were used to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of estimated 


odds ratios. Data analysis was performed using Stata 13 (College 
Station, TX). 

Ethical approval was waived since the analysis was considered 
nonhuman subjects 
research by the Florida International 
University Health Sciences Institutional Review Board. 

Among the 112,358 women who completed the PRAMS Phase 6 
Core Questionnaire, 110,231 provided information related to 
pregnancy intendedness and were included in this study. Table 1 
describes the demographic and clinical characteristics of mothers 
included in the sample by pregnancy intendedness. Of these, 32.3% 
had pregnancies categorized as desired; 17.5% had pregnancies 
categorized as mistimed: desired sooner; 40.1% had pregnancies 
categorized as mistimed: desired later; and 10.1% had pregnancies 
categorized as unwanted. All characteristics showed a statistically 
signiﬁcant relationship with pregnancy intendedness. Women with 
pregnancies categorized as mistimed: desired later or unwanted 
were more likely to be unmarried (P < 0.001), have a total 
household income of <$10,000 (P < 0.001), have an education 
level of high school or less (P < 0.001), have a medical history of 
depression (P < 0.001), report a history of abuse (P < 0.001), and 
have more stressors (P < 0.001).

Table 2 shows the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) 
for PPD among mothers surveyed by PRAMS from 2009 to 2011. 
No multicollinearity was observed in the adjusted model. With 
any incongruence between intention of pregnancy and time of 
conception, women were more likely to experience symptoms 
of PPD; this association remained even after adjustment for 
confounding variables. Women with pregnancies categorized as 
mistimed: desired sooner, mistimed: desired later, or unwanted 
had 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1–1.3), 1.3 (95% CI: 1.2–1.4), and 1.5 (95% 
CI: 1.3–1.7) times the odds of experiencing symptoms of PPD, 
respectively, compared to women with desired pregnancies. 
Other factors found to be associated with experiencing symptoms 
of PPD were a gestational age of <28 weeks (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 
2.5–4.0), having a previous history of depression (AOR = 1.8; 
95% CI: 1.6–2.0), and being abused during or before pregnancy 
(AOR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.4–2.0). A dose effect of the number of 
stressors on the increased odds of PPD symptoms was observed 
after adjustment. Having 1 to 2 stressors increased the odds of 
PPD symptoms by half (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.4–1.7), 3 to 5 
stressors more than doubled the odds (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI: 
2.2–2.7), and 6 or more stressors quadrupled the odds (AOR = 
4.1; 95% CI: 3.4–5.0). Women with household income

>$50,000 had 1.3 times the odds of experiencing symptoms of 
PPD compared to women with household income <$10,000 
(AOR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1–1.5). Unmarried women were less 
likely to experience symptoms of PPD (AOR = 0.9; 95% CI: 
0.8–0.9). Black women and women of other race were also less 
likely to experience symptoms of PPD (AOR = 0.7; 95% CI: 
0.6–0.7 and AOR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.8–0.95, respectively). 
Maternal age of 35 years or older had a borderline signiﬁcant 
association with experiencing symptoms of PPD (AOR = 1.2; 
95% CI: 1.0–1.4). 

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between 
pregnancy intendedness and experiencing symptoms of PPD. 
While other potential risk factors have been investigated, in our 
review of the literature we found only a few studies exploring the 
relationship between pregnancy intendedness and symptoms of 
PPD. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study utilizing a national 
sample to explore pregnancy intendedness as a possible risk factor 
for PPD symptoms. We found a signiﬁcant association between 
pregnancy intendedness and PPD symptoms, even after adjusting 
for several confounders. Women with pregnancies categorized as 
mistimed: desired sooner, mistimed: desired later, and unwanted 
had 1.2, 1.3, and 1.5 times the odds of experiencing symptoms of 
depression, respectively. Our results draw attention to the potential 
importance of targeted approaches to screen for PPD in women 
with mistimed or unwanted pregnancies. 
Our ﬁndings were similar to those of Iranfar et al, Karacam et al, 
and Cortés-Salim et al, who evaluated pregnancy intendedness as a 
risk factor for PPD in Iran, Turkey, and Mexico, respectively.[16–18] 
Iranfar et al found that Iranian women who had unintended 
pregnancies were at higher risk for PPD compared to women with 
intended pregnancies.[16] Likewise, Karacam et al observed that 
Turkish women with unplanned pregnancies experienced a greater 
number of psychiatric disorders during the early postpartum 
period compared to those with planned pregnancies, and Cortés- 
Salim et al reported that women with unplanned pregnancies had 
higher rates of psycho-emotional disorders compared to those who 
did not.[17,18] 
Beck et al and Robertson et al determined that prenatal 
depression was a predictor of PPD.[7,9] This study lends further 
support to that ﬁnding; women with a history of depression were 
approximately twice as likely to suffer from symptoms of PPD 
when compared to those without a history of depression. 
Similarly to Robertson et al, we discovered that as the number of 
stressors increased, the odds of PPD symptoms increased.[9] In 
respect to maternal age, our study supports the ﬁndings of 
McGuinness et al, who concluded that although not a sole risk 
factor, maternal age is associated with many challenges in 
pregnancy which may lead to a higher incidence of PPD.[12] 
Additionally, our ﬁndings were congruent with those of Beck 
et al, who found 13 signiﬁcant predictors of PPD, including 
unplanned/unwanted pregnancy, prenatal depression, life stress, 
and social support.[7] Our ﬁnding that women who were 
unmarried were slightly less likely to experience symptoms of 
PPD warrants further investigation. Other studies have examined 
the quality of the marital relationship as a contributing factor to 
PPD.[9,19] Our ﬁnding may be explained, at least in part, by the 
fact that we were unable to control for relationship quality. The 
ﬁndings that women of Black and other race had decreased odds 
of experiencing symptoms of PPD and that higher household 
income increased the odds is contrary to ﬁndings in other 
studies.[7,20] Complex factors such as awareness and cultural 
acceptability of reporting symptoms related to PPD may help to 
explain these ﬁndings but were beyond the scope of this analysis, 
thus requiring further investigation.[21] 
One strength of our study is the use of PRAMS data, which was 
collected in a systematic, standardized manner, and provided a 
large sample size representative of 78% of live births in the United 
States.[13] To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study in the literature 
to utilize PRAMS data to explore the association between 
pregnancy intendedness and experiencing symptoms of PPD on a 
national level. Possible limitations include the risk of recall and 
social desirability bias among respondents, as well as the cross- 
sectional nature of the data collected. Additionally, the extent to 
which stressors affected an individual respondent is unknown; 
PRAMS does not collect information that would help clarify the 
complicated relationship between the effects of stress on an 
individual. For this reason, we were unable to weight stressors 
based on their level of severity for each respondent. Furthermore, 
our operational deﬁnition for symptoms of PPD, based on the 
frequency the symptoms were experienced, may limit generaliz- 
ability. To improve screening procedures, future research may 
include determination of the threshold for the number and 
frequency of self-reported symptoms that should be considered 
indicative of the presence of PPD, with appropriate analysis of 
sensitivity and speciﬁcity when comparing to the gold standard of 
formal psychiatric diagnosis. 
We found that women with mistimed or unwanted pregnancies 
were more likely to experience symptoms of PPD. Our ﬁndings 
encourage physician evaluation of pregnancy intendedness 
during the patient’s prenatal and postpartum ofﬁce visits. This 
recommendation is relevant to primary care physicians, obste- 
tricians, and pediatricians who are likely to come in contact with 
mothers frequently in the weeks following birth. Our ﬁndings 
support the current US Preventive Services Task Force and 
American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations for an 
integrated approach to screening for depression with the ultimate 
goal of intervention and early referral for women at risk for PPD, 
as well as highlight the need for a quick and accurate diagnostic 
tool for early detection of PPD.[22–24] Given the potential physical 
and psychological impact of PPD on both mother and child, 
particularly for those with low levels of social support, adequate 
screening for symptoms of PPD is a public health imperative.
