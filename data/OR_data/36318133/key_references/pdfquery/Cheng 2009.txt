Background: This study was conducted to determine the relationship between unintended pregnancy and maternal behaviors before, during 
and after pregnancy. 
Study Design: Data were analyzed from a stratified random sample of 9048 mothers who delivered live born infants between 2001 and 2006 
and completed the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) survey 2 to 9 months after delivery. Binary and ordinal logistic 
regression methods with appropriate survey weights were used to control for socio-demographic factors. 
Results: Compared to women with intended pregnancies, mothers with unwanted pregnancies were more likely to consume less than the 
recommended amount of preconception folic acid [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7–3.2], smoke prenatally 
(OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.5–2.9), smoke postpartum (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.35–2.55) and report postpartum depression (OR 1.98, 95% CI 
1.48–2.64); they were less likely to initiate prenatal care during the first trimester (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.3–0.5) and breastfeed for 8 or more 
weeks (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57–0.97). Compared to women with intended pregnancies, women with mistimed pregnancies were also more 
likely to consume inadequate folic acid, delay prenatal care and report postpartum depression. 
Conclusion: Even after controlling for multiple socio-demographic factors, unwanted and mistimed pregnancies were associated with 
unhealthy perinatal behaviors.

The reduction of unintended pregnancy is a prominent 
reproductive health objective for Healthy People 2010 — a 
national set of goals aimed at decreasing significant 
preventable health threats [1]. With nearly half of all 
pregnancies in the US estimated to be unwanted or wanted 
later at the time of conception [2], the impact of unintended 
pregnancy is a major public health concern. 
A 1995 Institute of Medicine report [3] summarized the 
potential consequences of unintended pregnancy. The 
factors such as tobacco and 
report acknowledged that 
alcohol exposure, physical abuse, prenatal care utilization,

infant low birth weight, preterm birth and breastfeeding 
may not be directly related to pregnancy intention but 
may be due to the fact that unintended pregnancies are 
more common among women with disadvantaged back- 
grounds. 
studies have produced differing 
results on the relationship between pregnancy intention 
and maternal prenatal behaviors depending on the 
population studied and the methodology used [4–9]. 
Most previous studies in the US have mainly examined 
the association between pregnancy intention and prenatal 
behaviors, pregnancy outcomes, and breastfeeding. There 
studies on preconception or 
has been a paucity of 
postpartum factors and we know of no large US 
population-based studies on the relationship between 
pregnancy intention and perinatal behaviors for births 
occurring after 1999. 
The goal of our study was to examine the relationship 
between pregnancy intention and preconception, prenatal 
and postpartum maternal behaviors in a recent birth cohort 
while controlling for socio-demographic factors. 




We examined survey data collected from a random 
sample of postpartum mothers in Maryland who delivered 
live births between 2001 and 2006 and completed the 
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) 
survey. The Maryland Department of Health and Mental 
Hygiene conducts the survey under a cooperative agreement 
with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
Stratified random sampling is used to oversample mothers 35 
years of age or older and women who delivered low birth 
weight (b2500 g) infants. The annual sample, determined by 
the CDC for each PRAMS state, 
is large enough for 
estimating statewide risk factor proportions within 3.5% at a 
95% confidence level. Mothers are sent up to three surveys 
followed by telephone interviews if no response is received 
by mail. Survey data are linked with birth certificate data to 
provide additional demographic, medical and pregnancy 
information. The 9048 responses to the survey received 
during the study years were weighted to make the results 
representative of all Maryland women delivering live born 
infants during the study period and to account 
for 
nonresponse. The overall response rate for the survey during 
this study period was 71%. 
Pregnancy intention was assessed by response to the 
survey question, “Thinking back to just before you got 
pregnant, how did you feel about becoming pregnant?” For 
the purpose of this report, a woman who reported, “I wanted 
to be pregnant then” or “I wanted to be pregnant sooner” was 
considered to have had an intended pregnancy; a woman 
who reported, “I wanted to be pregnant later” was considered 
to have had a mistimed pregnancy; and a women who 
responded, “I didn't want to be pregnant then or at any time 
the future” was considered to have had an unwanted 
pregnancy. “I don't know” was not presented as a response 
option to this question. 
Maternal behaviors studied included use of a multi- 
vitamin containing folic acid during the 3 months before 
pregnancy, smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy, 
smoking postpartum, alcohol consumption during the last 3 
months of pregnancy, time of initiation of prenatal care, 
breastfeeding initiation, breastfeeding for 8 or more weeks, 
infant sleep position and postpartum contraception use. Data 
were summarized using PROC CROSSTAB in SAS-callable 
SUDAAN (RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC, 
USA). Binary and ordinal logistic regression methods using 
appropriate survey weights were used to control for socio- 
demographic factors including maternal age, race/ethnicity, 
Medicaid status, parity, marital status and educational level 
using Stata version 10.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, 
USA). The appropriate institutional review boards qualified 
this project as exempt research. 

their 
pregnancies were unintended, including 31.1% that were 
mistimed and 10.3% that were unwanted. Both mistimed 
and unwanted pregnancies were more prevalent among 
mothers who were black, unmarried, completed 12 or less 
years of school and were enrolled in Medicaid. Teen 
mothers had the highest percentage of births that were 
mistimed (65.8%), while women 40 years of age and older 
had the highest percentage of births that were unwanted 
(20.8%) (Table 1). 
With the exception of alcohol use during pregnancy and 
postpartum contraception use, unhealthy behaviors were 
more prevalent among mothers with unwanted births than 
mothers with mistimed or intended births (Table 2). After 
controlling for 
socio-demographic factors, unhealthy 
behaviors were still more likely to be associated with 
unwanted pregnancies than with intended or mistimed 
pregnancies (Table 3). However, pregnancy intention was 
significantly associated with breastfeeding

Our findings show that unintended pregnancies are very 
common, accounting for two out of every five live births in 
Maryland. Furthermore, the association of mistimed and 
unwanted births with unhealthy perinatal behaviors persists 
after controlling for multiple socio-demographic factors. 
Although current guidelines recommend that all women 
of childbearing age consume folic acid daily to prevent 
neural tube birth defects in case of unplanned pregnancy 
[10], our findings, similar to a prior study of 1998–1999 
Oregon births [11], showed that only 15% of mothers with 
unwanted pregnancies met these recommendations. After 
controlling for socio-demographic factors, we found that 
mothers with unwanted or mistimed pregnancies were more 
than twice as likely to report inadequate daily consumption 
of folic acid before pregnancy as mothers with intended 
pregnancies. Since preconception health visits are usually 
only utilized by women who are actively planning a 
pregnancy, women may benefit from the incorporation of 
folic acid guidelines into routine family planning or other 
health services that young women utilize. 
Our findings showed that women with unwanted or 
mistimed pregnancies were more likely to delay initiation of 
prenatal care until after the first trimester than women with 
intended pregnancies. The delay in prenatal care has been 
reported in other studies and, according to Kost et al. [4], 
most likely reflects a delay in recognition of the pregnancy. 
Although information about first trimester cigarette, alcohol 
and drug use is not collected through PRAMS survey, prior 
studies have shown that women with unplanned pregnancies 
are more likely to place their fetuses at risk during the first 
trimester through exposure to potential teratogens [9,12]. We 
found that women with unwanted pregnancies were more 
than twice as likely to smoke during the last 3 months of 
pregnancy than women with intended pregnancies. Since it is 
unlikely that nonsmokers would begin smoking during 
pregnancy, these women probably smoked throughout the 
pregnancy — placing their pregnancies at risk for many 
adverse outcomes [13]. In addition, a delay in care for 
women with medical disorders such as diabetes places their 
pregnancies at higher risk [14]. 
The findings that mothers with mistimed and unwanted 
births were as likely as mothers with intended births to 
initiate breastfeeding, place their infants to sleep on their 
backs and use postpartum contraception provide support 
for the concept that many mothers with unintended births

attempt to practice healthy behaviors. However, the more 
challenging behaviors, such as breastfeeding for 8 weeks' 
duration and smoking cessation, were less prevalent among 
women with unwanted pregnancies than among women 
with intended or mistimed ones. Past studies have similarly 
found that infants from unintended births are more likely 
to be breastfed shorter durations than infants from intended 
births [6,7,15]. In contrast, unlike these past studies, our 
research did not find differences in breastfeeding initiation. 
This may be due, in part, to PRAMS survey responses of 
breastfeeding even one time as a positive for breastfeeding 
initiation. Postpartum depression was also more prevalent 
among mothers with unwanted and mistimed births than 
among mothers with intended births. There has been 
surprisingly little research on the relationship between 
depression and unintended births in the US. The few 
studies that have looked at depression, mostly from other 
developed countries, have found higher levels of depres- 
sion among mothers with unwanted births [16–18]. Our 
study confirms these findings, showing that women with 
unwanted births were nearly twice as likely to report 
feeling depressed during the postpartum period as women 
with intended births. Postpartum depression has been 
in poor mother–infant 
shown to result 
interactions and 
subsequent behavioral and cognitive difficulties for the 
child [19–21]. In its most severe form, depression can 
threaten the life and safety of the mother and her family. 
Mothers with depressive symptoms are less likely to 
continue breastfeeding [22] and more likely to smoke daily 
[23]. Postpartum smoking and its association with 
pregnancy intention have not been studied adequately 
either. It is likely that smoking cessation may be especially 
problematic for women undergoing the stress of an 
unwanted birth. In addition, outcomes from exposure to 
secondhand smoke such as sudden infant death syndrome 
(SIDS), disruption of normal maternal–infant interactions 
due to maternal depression, and the loss of the full benefits 
of breast milk may have potential long-term consequences 
for a child [13,21,24] well beyond the perinatal period. 
The question of whether mistimed or unwanted pregnan- 
cies result in poor birth outcomes remains unanswered. A 
recent 18-state analysis of 1996–1999 births using PRAMS 
data revealed that unwanted births were more likely than 
intended births to be associated with preterm delivery but not 
infant birth weight [25]. However, the magnitude of this 
finding was relatively small (adjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 
1.01–1.33) [25] and other studies have not shown consistent 
findings for infant birth weight or preterm birth [5–7]. Future 
research should examine other outcomes such as neural tube 
defects, fetal or infant death, SIDS and later childhood 
cognitive or behavioral disorders that may be due to 
unhealthy behaviors associated with unwanted pregnancies. 
There are several limitations to this study. As in any 
retrospective survey, the responses are subject to recall bias. 
Also, the ideal time to ascertain pregnancy intention is just 
before conception and not after delivery when conditions 
may change the perception of intendedness [26]. Also, the 
definition of unintended pregnancy (pregnancy wanted later 
or unwanted at any time) is innately problematic. The 
PRAMS survey does not assess whether the mother or father 
was pleased with the pregnancy nor does it assess ambivalent 
feelings about the pregnancy or other social and cultural 
factors that go into the individual's desirability of the 
pregnancy [26,27]. Surveys such as PRAMS are subject to 
social desirability. Questions about smoking, alcohol and 
physical violence may not be answered truthfully and the 
incidence of these behaviors may be underestimated. The 
determination of postpartum depression was based on the 
mother's self-reporting of her symptoms and not on a clinical 
diagnosis. The dataset used for this study includes informa- 
tion collected only from mothers who delivered live born 
infants. It is possible that the association between pregnancy 
intendedness and preconceptional or prenatal behaviors may 
be different among women whose pregnancies result in fetal 
loss or pregnancy termination. 

In conclusion, unwanted pregnancies that result in live 
birth are associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy 
and postpartum, 
folic acid 
consumption, delayed initiation of prenatal care until after 
the first trimester, postpartum depression and breastfeeding 
for less than 8 weeks. Mistimed births were also associated 
with poor folic acid intake, delayed prenatal care and 
postpartum depression but to a lesser extent than unwanted 
births. Prevention of mistimed and unwanted births through 
pregnancy planning and utilization of effective contraception 
will help to reduce the magnitude of these unhealthy 
perinatal factors. Integration of topics such as smoking 
cessation and folic acid intake into primary care and family 
planning services for women of reproductive age may help to 
increase healthy behaviors among women with unintended 
pregnancies. Further research is needed to elucidate the 
potential perinatal and long-term adverse effects of unin- 
tended pregnancy on mothers and families.
