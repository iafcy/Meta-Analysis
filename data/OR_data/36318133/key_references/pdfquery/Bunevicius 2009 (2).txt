Abstract 
Objective. To assess the prevalence of antenatal depressive disorder in different trimesters and to evaluate the relation of 
psychosocial risk factors to antenatal depressive disorder. Design. Cohort follow-up. Setting. University Hospital, Kaunas, 
Lithuania. Sample. Two hundred and thirty pregnant women consecutively admitted. Methods. At 12(cid:1)16 weeks, 22(cid:1)26 
weeks, and 32(cid:1)36 weeks of pregnancy, participants were screened for depression using the World Health Organization’s 
Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF). Women who gave at least one positive answer to the 
CIDI-SF depression-screening question were evaluated for depressive disorder using the non-patient version of the 
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID-NP). Psychosocial stressors and two Big Five Personality dimensions, 
neuroticism and extraversion, were also evaluated. Main outcome measures. Prevalence of depressive disorder. Results. The 
prevalence of the antenatal depressive disorder at 12(cid:1)16 weeks’ gestation was 6.1%, at 22(cid:1)26 weeks 3.5%, and at 32(cid:1)36 
weeks 4.4%. In the first trimester, a greater prevalence of current depressive disorder was independently associated with 
unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, high neuroticism, low education, and a previous history of depression; in the second 
trimester with unplanned and unwanted pregnancy and high neuroticism; in the third trimester with unplanned and 
unwanted pregnancy, high neuroticism, and the occurrence of psychosocial stressors during the last year. Conclusions. The 
highest prevalence of depressive disorders was found in the first trimester, the lowest in mid-pregnancy. Several 
determinants (unwanted and unplanned pregnancy, high neuroticism) were independent predictors of antenatal depressive 
disorders throughout whole pregnancy, while other determinants (low education, previous history of depression, the 
occurrence of psychosocial stressors at the end of pregnancy) were trimester specific.

Psychiatric disorders, particularly mood and anxiety 
disorders, have the highest prevalence in women 
during childbearing years (1). A meta-analysis of 59 
studies found an increased rate of onset of depres- 
sion in pregnancy and in the postpartum period (2). 
Evidence suggests that postpartum depression can 
be part of a continuum, with onset of illness during 
pregnancy (3). A longitudinal cohort study showed 
that depressive symptoms are actually more common 
during gestation than in the postpartum period (4). 
The study by Gaynes et al. indicated that up to 11% 
of women suffer from major or minor depression 
during gestation (5).

Depression during pregnancy can have serious 
implications for all family members. Relationship 
conflicts, decreased ability to care for other children 
and loss of employment are examples. Uncontrolled 
maternal depression puts the developing fetus at 
harm due to substance abuse, poor prenatal care and 
suicide attempts (6). Mood and anxiety disorders 
during pregnancy are associated with diminished 
fetal wellbeing, poor obstetric outcomes, including 
birthweight, body mass index and preterm delivery 
(7,8), and with persistent behavioral problems dur- 
ing childhood (9). Therefore, early detection of 
antenatal depression and intervention are important 
clinical tasks. However, antenatally as well as post- 
natally depressed women are poorly identified by 
their general practitioners (10). Symptoms of de- 
pressive disorder, such as disturbed sleep, appetite, 
energy and interest level, may be incorrectly as- 
sumed to be symptoms associated with pregnancy or 
the postpartum period (11). 
Studies of antenatal depression have mostly ex- 
amined antenatal mood as a predictor of postnatal 
depression. There have been several efforts to 
develop ‘screening tools’ to predict which women 
will become depressed postnatally (12). While the 
predictive value of these instruments has been poor 
in identifying pregnant 
(12), they became useful 
women who are currently depressed (13). Psycho- 
social risk factors that are indicators of distress 
during pregnancy, such as previous negative preg- 
nancy experience (e.g. miscarriages, terminations), 
domestic violence, significant emotional losses prior 
to age 16 or within the past year may be associated 
with depressive mood during pregnancy (14,15). 
Maladaptive personality traits, such as chronic 
anxiety and low self-esteem (16), may also impact 
depressive mood during pregnancy. Although there 
is substantial evidence on the association between 
specific personality dimensions, such as neuroticism 
or introversion, and major depression in general and 
in the postpartum period (17,18), there are no data 
with regard to pregnancy. Recent reviews demon- 
strate that substantial risk factors for depression 
during pregnancy are a personal history of mood 
and anxiety disorders, previous postpartum depres- 
sion, family history of psychiatric disorders, younger 
age, unplanned pregnancy, ambivalence or negative 
feelings about the pregnancy, greater number of 
children, substance abuse or smoking, lower educa- 
tional levels, and unemployment (19). 
The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence 
the current antenatal depressive disorders at 
of 
different trimesters during gestation and to evaluate 
the relation between psychosocial risk factors and 
antenatal depressive disorder. 

In 2005, women who attended for antenatal care at 
two antenatal clinics in Kaunas, Lithuania, were 
invited to participate. All were low risk, and mid- 
wives and family doctors gave antenatal care, while 
according to Lithuanian antenatal care regulations, 
there was an obligatory consultation with an obste- 
trician twice during pregnancy. Three hundred and 
seven consecutive women signed the informed con- 
sent. Women who did not attend all three study 
assessments (n (cid:2)77) were excluded from the study. 
These 77 women were no different from those who 
attended all assessments in terms of psychosocial 
and demographic characteristics. 
Data from 230 (74.9% response rate) eligible 
women were thus used for the final analysis (Table 
I). Age ranged from 18 to 43 years (mean 299 
5 years). All women were Caucasian and fluent in 
Lithuanian. None of the participating women re- 
ceived biological or psychological treatment for a 
depressive disorder. 
The participants were interviewed three times by 
the same psychiatrist (LK): at 12(cid:1)16, 22(cid:1)26, and 
32(cid:1)36 weeks. During the first pregnancy assessment 
time (12(cid:1)16 weeks of pregnancy), a translated ver-

Association was used to collect clinical and psycho- 
social data (age, level of education, working outside 
home, lifestyle habits, history of depression, history 
of depression in the family, obstetrical history, as 
well as was this pregnancy wanted or not) (20). 
During all three pregnancy assessment times, wo- 
men were screened for depression using the World 
Health Organization’s Composite International Di- 
agnostic Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF) (21). All 
women who gave at least one positive answer to the 
CIDI-SF depression screening question were admi- 
nistered the detailed standard psychiatric diagnostic 
assessment with the non-patient version of 
the 
Interview for DSM-III-R 
Structured Clinical 
(SCID-NP) (22). During all three pregnancy assess- 
ment times, the occurrence of psychosocial stressors 
was evaluated using the validated translation of the 
DSM-III-R Severity of Psychosocial Stressors Scale 
in Adults during the last year (23). At the second 
assessment 
two personality 
dimensions, neuroticism and extroversion, were 
assessed using the Big Five Personality Inventory 
(BFPI) (24). 

The CIDI-SF was developed by the World Health 
Organization from the full version of the CIDI to 
screen for the most commonly occurring psychiatric 
diagnoses. 
A previously validated Lithuanian translation of 
the SCID-NP was employed for detailed psychiatric 
diagnostic assessment (25). The SCID-NP com- 
prises a semi-structured clinical interview ensuring 
accurate and reliable psychiatric diagnosis and con- 
sists of several models designed to diagnose specific 
mental disorders. We used module ‘A’ for diagnosing 
mood syndromes such as major depression and 
dysthymia, and module ‘I’ for diagnosing adjustment 
disorder with depressive mood. Women who were 
diagnosed as having current major depressive dis- 
order, current dysthymia or current adjustment 
disorder with depressed mood were classified as a 
case. 
A previously validated Lithuanian translation of 
the DSM-III-R Severity of Psychosocial Stressors 
Scale in Adults during last year (23) was used to 
evaluate the occurrence of psychosocial stressors. 
The rating of the stressor is based on the clinician’s 
assessment of how an ‘average’ person in similar 
circumstances and with similar sociocultural values 
would experience the particular stressor(s). The 
rating is based on the severity of the stressor itself, 
not on the person’s vulnerability to the particular 
stressor. 
Subscales of neuroticism and of extraversion of the 
BFPI (24) consist of eight statements each. Each 
statement is scored from zero to five according to the 

extent to which someone agrees or disagrees with the 
listed characteristic of personality. A high neuroti- 
cism score indicates a tendency to experience 
unpleasant emotions easily and to react more in- 
tensely than normal. A low extraversion score 
interac- 
indicates inhibition and shyness in social 
tions. We used categorical classification of these 
subscales. Subjects scoring higher than the mean 
(cid:3)1 SD on the subscale of neuroticism were con- 
sidered as cases with high neuroticism. Subjects 
scoring lower than 1 SD below the mean on the 
subscale of extraversion were considered as cases 
with low extraversion. Hence, a score of ]28 on the 
subscale of neuroticism was used to define high 
neuroticism (n (cid:2)41, 17.8%), and a score of 523 on 
the subscale of extraversion was used to define low 
extraversion (n (cid:2)47, 20.4%). 
The CIDI-SF and the BFPI were translated into 
Lithuanian using the standard procedure of double 
translation by two psychiatrists: RB and LK. 
The Biomedical Research Ethics Committee at 
the Kaunas University of Medicine approved this 
study. 

The normality of the distribution of personality 
subscales was checked using the one sample 
Kolmogorov(cid:1)Smirnov test. Data on the psychosocial 
and demographic characteristics of the subjects were 
summarized using descriptive statistics. Prevalence 
rates for antenatal depressive disorders during each 
trimester of pregnancy were compared using McNe- 
mar tests (Table II). Logistic regression analysis was 
used to examine factors associated with a depressive 
disorder as the dependent variable (OR, 95% CI). 
Independent variables were selected based on the 
data published in the literature, such as demo- 
graphic, psychosocial, and personality factors. To 
assess an association between psychosocial factors 
and antenatal depressive disorder, first a univariate 
logistic model was used. Subsequently, only those 
in the univariate 
variables that were significant 
model during different 
trimesters of pregnancy 
were entered in a multiple logistic regression model. 
All comparisons were two-way and at 5% signifi- 
cance level. Analysis was performed using the 
Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS). 

In total, 17% (n (cid:2)38), 11% (n (cid:2)26), and 11% (n (cid:2) 
25) of women were screened positive for depressive 
disorders at 12(cid:1)16, 22(cid:1)26, and 32(cid:1)36 weeks of 
respectively. The prevalence rate of

clinical diagnosis of any depressive disorder was 
6.1% (n (cid:2)14) at 12(cid:1)16 weeks, 3.5% (n (cid:2)8) at 22(cid:1) 
26 weeks, and 4.4% (n (cid:2)10) at 32(cid:1)36 weeks of 
pregnancy (Table II). In total, 17 (7.4%) women 
were diagnosed as having a depressive disorder at 
least once during pregnancy. Depressive disorders 
consisted of major depression (14 women), adjust- 
ment disorder with depressed mood (two women) 
and dysthymia (one woman). The prevalence of 
major depression was 5.2% (n (cid:2)12) at 12(cid:1)16 weeks, 
2.6% (n (cid:2)6) at 22(cid:1)26 weeks, and 3.5% (n (cid:2)7) at 
32(cid:1)36 weeks of pregnancy. 
Seven of the 14 women diagnosed with a depres- 
sive disorder at 12(cid:1)16 weeks of pregnancy recovered 
without any treatment, the other seven remained 
depressed during the second and third trimester of 
pregnancy, also without any treatment. One of seven 
women who recovered from depression reported a 
non-planned pregnancy, while five of seven who did 
not recover during gestation (OR: 15.0, 95% CI: 
1.03; 218.3). In the second trimester of pregnancy, 
one woman who was newly diagnosed as having 
adjustment disorder with depressed mood, remained 
depressed during the third trimester. In the third 
trimester of pregnancy, 
two women were newly 
diagnosed as having a mild episode of major depres- 
sion. 
In Table III, the results of a univariate logistic 
regression are shown with a diagnosis of a depressive 
disorder as the dependent variable. There were four 
determinants significantly associated with depression 
at all assessments: non-planned pregnancy, a perso- 
nal history of depression in the past, a personal 
history of psychiatric treatment in the past and high 
neuroticism scores. During the first trimester, low 
education, the occurrence of psychosocial stressors 
and a family history of depression were also signifi- 
cantly related to depression. Psychosocial stressors 
were related to depression during the last trimester. 
Smoking was related to depression at a 90% signifi- 
cance level during the second and third trimesters. 
The results of a multiple logistic regression 
analysis with depression as the dependent variable 
at three different trimesters of pregnancy are shown 
in Table IV. In the first trimester, depression was 
independently related to unplanned and unwanted 
pregnancy, high neuroticism, low education and a 
previous history of depression; in the second trime- 
ster, depression was independently related to un- 
planned and unwanted pregnancy 
and high 
neuroticism; in the third trimester, depression was 
independently related to unplanned and unwanted 
pregnancy, high neuroticism and occurrence of 
psychosocial stressors during the last year. 

Our study has demonstrated that the highest pre- 
valence of antenatal depressive disorders was at the 
beginning of pregnancy, the lowest in mid-preg- 
nancy. Unwanted und unplanned pregnancy and 
high neuroticism scores were stable determinants of 
antenatal depression. Furthermore, depression was 
associated with low education and a previous history 
of depression at the beginning of pregnancy, and 
with the occurrence of psychosocial stressors at the 
end of pregnancy. 
A recent review of the literature on antenatal major 
depression reported a point prevalence ranging from 
3.1 to 4.9% at different times during pregnancy (5). 
Our data on the prevalence rates of antenatal 
depressive disorder are in the same range, 2.6(cid:1)5.2% 
at different trimesters of pregnancy. Our prevalence 
rate data of any antenatal depressive disorder ranges 
from 3.5 to 6.1% and correspond to data from other 
studies. Pop et al. (20), using the CIDI as a 
diagnostic instrument, reported the prevalence of 
depression ranging from 5.3% during the first 
trimester of pregnancy to 2.9% during the third 
trimester of pregnancy. Lee et al. (26), using the 
SCID-NP, reported a 6.4% prevalence of depression 
in Chinese women at the 38th week of pregnancy. 
The role of personality dimensions in major 
depression has long been studied. Many reports 
have consistently documented that personality traits, 
such as high neuroticism, low extraversion, low self- 
esteem, excessive self-criticism or interpersonal de- 
pendency, are associated with depression in both

general and postpartum populations (18, 27). There 
is ample evidence showing that, during a major 
depression, the scores for neuroticism are increased. 
This effect is usually attributed to the state effect of 
depression (27). A recent general population-based 
study of 4,796 subjects showed that personality- 
related vulnerability (high levels of neuroticism, 
depressive coping style and low self-esteem) was 
present more than one year before the onset of the 
episode of major depression, which increased further 
during the episode of depression to return to 
premorbid levels after full remission (28). The 
authors suggest the ongoing expression of vulner- 
ability as a personality deviance and synchrony of 
change between severity of depressive symptoms and 
personality deviance. Our study is the first 
to 
examine the relation between personality and an- 
tenatal depressive disorder. We found that high 
neuroticism but not low extraversion was signifi- 
cantly associated with depression during each trime- 
ster of pregnancy. This is in accordance with results 
from previous studies in the general population (27) 
and in postpartum women (18). 
Pregnancy and birth itself are often regarded as 
stressful life events possibly leading to depression 
(28). The relation between life events, vulnerability 
to stress and the onset of depression is well estab- 
lished in a psychiatric population. In this study, we 
found that stressful life events, such as unwanted and 
unplanned pregnancy, were associated with depres- 
sive disorder through all trimesters of pregnancy. 
Pakenhalm et al. (29) reported that during the third 
trimester of pregnancy, higher rates of depression are 
life events. 
related to higher reports of stressful 
These findings correspond with our data showing 
that an association between depression and psycho- 
social stressors in the third trimester of gestation is 
not limited to unwanted pregnancy and covers other 
psychosocial stressors as well. 
We found lower education to be an independent 
risk factor of depression at early pregnancy, which has 
also been described in other studies (19). Lower 
education is frequently related to lower socioeco- 
nomic status, which is also a risk factor for depression. 
Smoking and depression were related at a 90% 
significance level in the second and third trimesters 
of pregnancy. Others also report a relation between 
smoking and depression (30). The fact that this 
relation in the current study was not significant at a 
95% level is mainly explained by the low number of 
women who smoked during gestation. According to 
the Lithuanian National Birth Register for the year 
2006, before pregnancy 8.3% of women reported 
smoking and during pregnancy 5% reported smok- 
ing (31). The lower prevalence of smokers found in 
our study might suggest that the more vulnerable 
women did not participate in the study. A high 
prevalence of alcohol intake might be explained by 
women being considered as alcohol consumers if 
they used at 
least one drink of alcohol during 
pregnancy, according to Dutch Royal Midwifery 
Association interview format used. 
A limitation of the study is the relatively small 
sample. Another limitation is the lack of a control 
group of non-pregnant women. Moreover, biological 
determinants of depression, such as thyroid dysfunc- 
tion and immunity (20), and certain social factors, 
such as domestic violence and use of narcotics, were 
also not evaluated in this report. 
The strengths of this study are its prospective 
design, the fact that one psychiatrist performed the 
psychiatric evaluation using standardized instru- 
ments (including syndromal diagnoses of psychiatric 
disorders) and that personality traits such as neuroti- 
cism and extroversion were evaluated. 
Until recently, researchers and health care provi- 
ders have especially focused on recognizing and 
treating depression during the postnatal period. 
However, unrecognized and untreated antenatal 
depression also has a negative impact on the well- 
being of the fetus and mother. Therefore, 
it is 
to diagnose and treat depression in 
important 
pregnancy. A better understanding of the factors 
that increase the risk of developing antenatal depres- 
sion may contribute to achieving this goal.
