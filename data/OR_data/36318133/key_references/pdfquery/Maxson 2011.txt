Pregnancy Intention, Demographic Differences, 
and Psychosocial Health 


Objectives: We explore the psychosocial, demographic, and maternal characteristics across wanted, mistimed, 
and unwanted pregnancies. 
Methods: Data from 1321 women from a prospective cohort study of pregnant women in Durham, NC, are 
analyzed. Psychosocial correlates were obtained through prenatal surveys; electronic medical records were used 
to ascertain maternal health and pregnancy outcomes. 
Results: Sixty-two percent of the women indicated an unintended pregnancy, with 44% (578) mistimed and 18% 
(245) unwanted. Only 38% of the pregnancies were characterized as wanted. Women with unwanted and with 
mistimed pregnancies were similar demographically, but they differed signiﬁcantly on psychosocial proﬁles and 
maternal characteristics. Women with mistimed and with wanted pregnancies differed in demographics and 
psychosocial proﬁles. Wanted pregnancies had the healthiest, mistimed an intermediate, and unwanted the 
poorest psychosocial proﬁle. Women with unwanted pregnancies had the highest depression, perceived stress, 
and negative paternal support scores ( p < 0.05) and the lowest self-efﬁcacy, social support, and positive paternal 
support scores ( p < 0.05). In multivariate analyses, women with riskier psychosocial proﬁles had higher odds of 
being in the unwanted category. Controlling for psychosocial and demographic variables, perceived stress and 
positive paternal support remained signiﬁcant predictors of belonging to the unwanted and mistimed groups. 
Conclusions: Fully characterizing pregnancy intention and its relationship to psychosocial proﬁles may provide 
a basis for identifying women with highest risk during pregnancy and early motherhood. Women with un- 
wanted and mistimed pregnancies may appear similar demographically but are different psychosocially. Wo- 
men with unwanted pregnancies have multiple risk factors and would beneﬁt from targeted interventions. 


unintended pregnancies to 30%, the United States ex- 
periences consistently high rates, ranging from 40% to 65%.1–3 
Unintended pregnancy remains a vital public health issue, as 
it has been associated with delayed and inadequate prenatal 
care,4,5 higher rates of low birth weight and preterm birth 
infants,4–9 infant mortality,5,7 risky behaviors during preg- 
nancy,10–12 maternal morbidity and mortality,4,13 and in- 
creased medical costs.14 
Pregnancy intention varies by demographic characteristics, 
with unintended pregnancies reported more often in women 
who are black,13,15,16 unmarried,13,15,16 less educated,13,15,16 
and enrolled in Medicaid.16 In one study, women without 
high school diplomas were three times more likely to have an 
unintended pregnancy than women with college degrees.1 
Importantly, although the proportion of unintended preg- 
nancies is highest among teens, women aged ‡ 20 account for 
the largest number of unintended pregnancies.1,17 These de- 
mographic characteristics have been linked, independent of 
intention, to adverse pregnancy outcomes,18–20 and the rela- 
tionship between pregnancy intention and birth outcomes 
attenuates in some cases after adjusting for maternal socio- 
economic variables.15,21 An unintended pregnancy may be an 
additional stressor during pregnancy and may modify a 
woman’s psychosocial health, contributing to the risk of ad- 
verse outcomes. 
As the rates for unintended pregnancy have remained high 
despite multiple and varied intervention strategies,1,22,23 re- 
searchers have incorporated a more nuanced deﬁnition of in- 
tention to better understand the problem and thus design more 
effective intervention programs.4,13,24–28 Conventionally, the 
literature has divided pregnancy into two categories: intended 
and unintended.15,29 This dichotomous classiﬁcation com- 
bines mistimed and unwanted pregnancies into one category, 




unintended. A mistimed pregnancy may be inherently differ- 
ent from an unwanted pregnancy. For example, D’Angelo 
et al.24 found that the majority of births (57%) were intended. 
When the 43% unintended category was broken down, how- 
ever, 32% of births were mistimed, leaving 11% of the births 
unwanted. Women who report an unwanted pregnancy often 
are older than women who report a mistimed pregnancy,16,24 
suggesting that the context of an unwanted pregnancy likely 
differs from the context of a mistimed pregnancy. Therefore, it 
may not be valid to combine these two categories. 
Psychosocial health has been found to differ among inten- 
tion status. Although the work on psychosocial health is still 
relatively new,5 Orr and Miller30 were at the forefront over a 
decade ago, comparing psychosocial health among women 
with wanted, mistimed, and unwanted pregnancies. They 
found that women with unwanted pregnancies had the 
highest levels of depression and exposure to stress and the 
lowest levels of support. Women with mistimed pregnancies 
were intermediate between women with unwanted and 
wanted pregnancies. Urging cautious interpretation, Orr and 
Miller emphasize the risks of unwanted and mistimed preg- 
nancies to the well-being of these women. Similarly, in more 
recent research, women with unintended pregnancies have 
reported higher levels of depression,16,31,32 higher levels of 
stress,32 and lower levels of well-being.33 
This current work complements the existing literature on 
pregnancy intention by focusing on demographic and psy- 
chosocial proﬁles, with an emphasis on whether these proﬁles 
differ across intention status, particularly unwanted and 
mistimed pregnancies. We deﬁne the psychosocial proﬁle as 
the constellation of depression, self-efﬁcacy, paternal support, 
social support, and perceived stress, an indicator of psycho- 
social health involving strengths and strains. We use an on- 
going prospective cohort study of pregnant women in 
Durham County, NC, and categorize intention as wanted, 
mistimed, or unwanted. This allows for more systematic 
comparisons across maternal subgroups, including an anal- 
ysis of whether mothers with mistimed vs. unwanted preg- 
nancies constitute different subgroups. 

The Healthy Pregnancy, Healthy Baby Study is an ongoing 
prospective cohort study designed to examine the effects of 
environmental, social, and host factors on racial disparities in 
pregnancy outcomes. The study, part of the U.S. Environ- 
mental Protection Agency (USEPA)-funded Southern Center 
on Environmentally Driven Disparities in Birth Outcomes 
(SCEDDBO), enrolls pregnant women from the Duke Ob- 
stetrics Clinic and the Durham County Health Department 
Prenatal Clinic. Women receiving prenatal care at these sites 
were eligible to participate if they were at least 18 years of age, 
English literate, between 18 and 28 weeks of gestation at study 
enrollment, lived in Durham County, were planning on de- 
livering at Duke University Medical Center, and did not have 
a multiple gestation or any known fetal genetic or congenital 
abnormalities. 
Demographic, health behavior, and medical history data 
were obtained by direct patient interview and through elec- 
tronic medical record review at the time of enrollment. In- 
formation on events of the pregnancy, labor and delivery, and 
health of the neonate were ascertained from maternal and 
neonatal electronic medical records. Psychosocial proﬁles 
were assessed through a variety of survey instruments given 
between 18 and 28 weeks gestation, including the Fragile 
Families and Child Well-Being Survey,34 the Perceived Stress 
Scale (PSS),35 the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List 
(ISEL),36 the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 
Scale (CES-D),37 and the Jerusalem and Schwarzer instrument 
for assessing self-efﬁcacy.38 

Pregnancy intention was assessed with a module devel- 
oped by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) in its Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 
(PRAMS) study.39 This question asks the mother to think back 
to just before she became pregnant with this child and indicate 
how she felt about becoming pregnant. Response choices in- 
clude wanting to become pregnant sooner, later, at that time, 
or not at all. We combined responses indicating wanting to 
become pregnant sooner and at that time as wanted. We 
classiﬁed later as mistimed and not at all as unwanted. 

Depression was assessed using the CES-D scale.37 De- 
signed for use in nonpsychiatric samples from the general 
population, it has excellent psychometric properties. 

The relationship with the biological father was assessed 
with a battery of questions taken from the Fragile Families 
and Child Well-Being Survey.34 The module assesses the 
amount of supportiveness and conﬂict present in the rela- 
tionship. In a nationally representative survey, these mea- 
sures were signiﬁcant predictors of marital and romantic 
status.40 Positive paternal support comprises understanding, 
affection, listening, and empathy. Negative paternal support 
comprises critical, controlling, and abusive behaviors. 

The PSS assesses subjective experience of stress.21 PSS items 
tap the degree to which individuals feel that events in their 
lives are unpredictable and uncontrollable. Comparisons of 
the 10-item version with the original 14-item version of the 
scale reveal that the shorter version is psychometrically su- 
perior; Cronbach’s alpha reliability was 0.78. 

The ISEL22 is used to assess several dimensions of social 
support, including self-esteem, tangible social support, be- 
longing, and satisfaction with supports; Cronbach’s alpha 
was between 0.80 and 0.89. 

Self-efﬁcacy is measured using the 10-item Jerusalem and 
Schwarzer General Self-Efﬁcacy Scale. This module measures 
how well respondents can cope with daily hassles and their 
ability to adapt to stressful circumstances; Cronbach’s alpha 
for this module ranges from 0.76 to 0.90.38 
This analysis includes women enrolled between study in- 
ception in June 2005 and September 2010. Of the 1743 women 


enrolled in the study, 85 were excluded from analysis because 
they did not report pregnancy intention. An additional 155 
women were excluded because of missing data on at least one 
demographic covariate (race, age, education, income, marital 
status). Because there were small numbers of Hispanics and 
Asians, we restricted this analysis to non-Hispanic black (NHB) 
(oversampling intentional) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) 
women. Thus, 1321 women were included in these analyses. 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was run to compare the 
three groups in terms of demographics, psychosocial proﬁles, 
and pregnancy outcomes. In addition, multivariate analyses 
controlling for demographic characteristics previously found 
to be related to pregnancy intention were performed with 
multinomial 
logistic regression. The Healthy Pregnancy, 
Healthy Baby Study and all associated analyses are conducted 
according to a research protocol approved by Duke’s In- 
stitutional Review Board. All analyses were run using STATA 
10 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). 


Demographic characteristics of the sample can be found in 
Table 1. The sample is predominantly low income, with 51% 
of the women reporting annual incomes of < $20,000. In ad- 
dition, 77% of the sample are NHB, 72% are single, and 73% 
are on Medicaid or are without health insurance. The mean 
age of women enrolled in the study is 26.2 years, with 45% of 
the sample < age 25. Sixty-two percent of the women indi- 
cated that the pregnancy was unintended, with 44% (578) 
mistimed and 18% (245) unwanted. Only 38% of the preg- 
nancies were characterized as wanted. 

Signiﬁcant demographic differences exist across the three 
intention categories (Table 1). Women who reported an un- 
wanted pregnancy were more likely than those who reported 
a wanted pregnancy to have lower incomes, be NHB, have 
lower educational attainment, be single, and have three or 
more children. Whereas the demographic differences were 
pronounced between the unwanted and wanted categories, 
the unwanted and mistimed groups were similar on most 
demographic characteristics. The unwanted and mistimed 
groups were not statistically different on percent NHB, in- 
come, marital status, or education. The only statistically sig- 
niﬁcant demographic differences between the unwanted and 
mistimed groups were that women with mistimed pregnan- 
cies were younger and less likely to have three or more chil- 
dren than the unwanted category. Women with wanted 
pregnancies were signiﬁcantly more likely to be married and 
less likely to be NHB and have higher incomes and educa- 
tional attainment 
the other two groups 
( p < 0.0001). 


Maternal characteristics played an important role in preg- 
nancy intention as well (Table 2). Compared to women who

reported a wanted or a mistimed pregnancy, women who 
reported an unwanted pregnancy were signiﬁcantly more 
likely to have had a previous preterm birth ( p < 0.0001). They 
were also more likely to have had a previous therapeutic 
(optional) abortion ( p < 0.01). Further, they were less likely to 
be having their ﬁrst child ( p < 0.0001). Interestingly, 18% of the 
unwanted group were having their ﬁrst child. 

The psychosocial characteristics reﬂected the ordinal na- 
ture of the intention groups (Table 3). Generally, we might 
have increasing concern for maternal and fetal health as one 
moves along the continuum from wanted to mistimed to 
unwanted pregnancies. Women who are trying to get preg- 
nant may be more likely to have considered their precon- 
ception health and habits than women in both other 
categories, and the women whose pregnancies are mistimed 
may be more likely to adjust their habits in response to their 
pregnancy than women who do not want to be pregnant at all. 
We see this ordinal nature of the categories playing out in the 
psychosocial characteristics as well. Women who reported 
their pregnancy as wanted have signiﬁcantly better psycho- 
social characteristics than women who reported their preg- 
nancy as mistimed, whose characteristics were signiﬁcantly 
better than those of women who reported their pregnancy as 
unwanted (Table 3). It should be noted that although the 
mean depression score among women who reported their 
pregnancy as unwanted (18.0) was above the cutoff for clinical 
depression in the general population (16), the pregnancy 
cutoff is generally higher due to the physical similarities in 
some of the symptoms of pregnancy and depression (fatigue, 
sleep changes).30,32,41 Women with wanted pregnancies 
scored much lower on depression, with a mean score of 12.4, 
and those in the mistimed category had an intermediate av- 
erage score of 15.1. Self-efﬁcacy, a measure of a sense of 
control, was signiﬁcantly lower in the unwanted group 
compared to the wanted group, but not statistically different 
from the mistimed group. Perceived stress was signiﬁcantly 
higher in the unwanted group compared to the mistimed and 
wanted groups and was signiﬁcantly higher in the the mis- 
timed group than in the wanted group. 
Women with unwanted pregnancies had signiﬁcantly 
lower levels of social support, as measured by the ISEL 
checklist. Additionally, women with unwanted pregnancies 
had statistically signiﬁcantly higher levels of negative pater- 
nal support and statistically signiﬁcantly lower levels of 
positive paternal support compared to the other two groups 
(Table 3). 

The ANOVA results provide important insights, but mul- 
tivariate analysis is required to fully understand membership 
of intention categories. Analyses controlled for maternal race, 
maternal age, maternal education, marital status, income, and 
having three or more children. Table 4 presents the base 
model, containing only the covariates. Comparing unwanted 
with wanted pregnancies, the signiﬁcant predictors were be- 
ing NHB (OR 4.64, CI 2.48-8.68), being single (OR 2.38, CI 
1.44-3.93), higher income (OR 0.40, CI 0.22-0.74), and having 
three or more children (OR 2.74, CI 1.69-4.44). Predictors 
varied for the mistimed/wanted comparison. Race dropped 
signiﬁcance, but age gained signiﬁcance. Being in the age

would be in the mistimed group (OR 2.7, CI 1.7-4.3; OR 1.8, CI

children (OR 2.2, CI 1.4-3.5) predicted membership in the 
unwanted vs. mistimed category. 
Before adding the psychosocial health measures to the 
multivariate, multinomial model for intention status, we 
present Table 5 showing the distribution of each psychosocial 
survey score in the sample population of participants re- 
porting all demographic covariates (note, about 10% of par- 
ticipants did not report income and were excluded here). 
Higher scores on the surveys measuring perceived stress, 
depression, and negative paternal support are associated with 
higher risk psychosocial health (i.e. more perceived stress, 
more depression, and more negative paternal support). 
Lower scores on the surveys measuring self-efﬁcacy, social 
support, and positive paternal support are associated with 
higher risk psychosocial health (i.e. lower self-efﬁcacy, less 
social support and less positive paternal support). 
Psychosocial variables also predicted intention group 
membership (Table 6). Table 6 presents the crude, covariate- 
adjusted, and fully adjusted models. In comparing the un- 
wanted and wanted groups, all psychosocial variables inde- 
pendently signiﬁcantly distinguished the unwanted and 
wanted groups. Higher scores on depression, perceived 
stress, and negative paternal support increased the likelihood 
that one would be in the unwanted group. Conversely, higher 
scores on social support and positive paternal support de- 
creased the likelihood that one would be in the unwanted 
group. The covariates in the base model remained similar 
with the addition of each psychosocial variable. When cov- 
ariates are added to the model, higher scores on depression, 
perceived stress, and negative paternal support predicted 
being in the unwanted as compared to the wanted group. In 
the fully adjusted model, which includes the covariates as 
well as all psychosocial measures, higher levels of perceived 
stress signiﬁcantly increased the likelihood (OR 1.7, CI 1.1-

signiﬁcantly differentiating the groups. The fully adjusted 
model follows the same pattern, with perceived stress 
increasing and positive paternal support decreasing the 
odds of being in the mistimed group (compared to the 
wanted). 
The unwanted and mistimed groups differed on all psy- 
chosocial characteristics in the unadjusted models. When the 
covariates are added to the model, higher scores on depres- 
sion, perceived stress, and negative paternal support signiﬁ- 
cantly increase the likelihood and higher scores on social 
support and positive paternal support signiﬁcantly decrease 
the likelihood that one is in the unwanted as compared to the 
mistimed group. In the fully adjusted model, the relationships 
are attenuated. 
Pregnancy outcome differences across 
intention categories 
ANOVA analyses of the three groups indicate statistically 
signiﬁcant differences in birth weight and gestational age. In 
pairwise comparisons, mean birth weight was signiﬁcantly 
lower in the unwanted group compared to the other two 
groups (unwanted = 3000 g; mistimed = 3083 g; wanted = 3144 g, 
p < 0.05). Similarly, mean gestational age was signiﬁcantly 
lower for the unwanted group (unwanted = 37.7; mistimed = 
38.1; wanted = 38.1, p < 0.05). The disparity increased even 
more when dichotomizing on spontaneous delivery rather 
than clinically indicated induction at < 32 weeks (unwanted, 
4%; mistimed, 1%; wanted, 1%, p < 0.05). These statistical 
differences were attenuated in multivariate analyses, with the 
covariates accounting for differences in birth weight and 
gestational age. 

This analysis examined the maternal and psychosocial 
contributors to intention status in an ongoing prospective 
cohort study. In our sample, the unwanted and mistimed 
pregnancies were similar demographically but markedly 
different on psychosocial health measures and maternal 
characteristics. Unwanted pregnancies also differed from 
wanted pregnancies demographically and psychosocially. 
The mistimed and wanted groups differed in both areas as 
well. 
The psychosocial differences among the groups merit fur- 
ther elucidation. Our ﬁndings complement previous research 
that psychosocial health differs across pregnancy intention 
groups.16,30–33 Similar to earlier research, our unwanted 
group has a risky proﬁle, experiencing high levels of depres- 
sion, perceived stress, and negative paternal support along 
with low levels of self-efﬁcacy and support, both general and 




paternal. Looking holistically at this psychosocial proﬁle and 
the at-risk demographic proﬁle, these women are at sub- 
stantial risk. It is unlikely that these proﬁles will change when 
the pregnancy is over; rather, these risks are often long term 
and not easily ameliorated. Especially important is the ﬁnding 
that these women report high levels of perceived stress, with 
corresponding low levels of paternal support, even after 
controlling for all other psychosocial and demographic cov- 
ariates. Further, although the relationships between intention 
and birth weight and gestational age are attenuated when 
controlling for covariates, women with unwanted pregnan- 
cies have mean lower birth weights and earlier deliveries. It is 
important to explore why some women have repeated un- 
wanted pregnancies. Over one third of the women in the 
unwanted category had previously had an elective abortion, 
with 12% having had more than one abortion. Our data in- 
dicate that serial unwanted pregnancies constitute a signiﬁ- 
cant public health problem. Women who already have three 
or more children at home may be at particular risk for con- 
textual stress with a lack of appropriate support, potentially 
impacting maternal mental and physical health as well as 
long-term parenting ability. 
Another interesting subset of women who reported an 
unwanted pregnancy is the 18% who are pregnant with their 
ﬁrst child. Many would expect that these women would re- 
port that their pregnancy is mistimed rather than unwanted. 
Further elucidation of these women’s context and motivation 
would be worthwhile. Even within the same intention cate- 
gory, women may differ dramatically. 
We argue that the three categories of intention—unwanted, 
mistimed, and wanted—more appropriately identify inten- 
tion phenotypes as compared to the more traditional intended 
vs. unintended dichotomization. A woman who becomes 
pregnant earlier than expected may react and behave differ- 
ently from either a woman who becomes pregnant when 
planned or one who does not want the pregnancy at all. 
Further, the women who reported a wanted pregnancy may 
have already begun preparing for the pregnancy through 
recommended lifestyle changes. Our results agree with pre- 
vious research that indicates that combining the unwanted 
and mistimed groups masks important differences between 
the groups,11,13,15,16,24,28,30,42 with clinical 
implications in 
needs assessment and ancillary service delivery, such as social 
work. 

limitations. Self-reported preg- 
nancy intention has inherent issues. The acceptance of ad- 
mitting an unwanted or mistimed pregnancy may vary by 
culture. We are limited in our ability to address this, as our 
sample is predominantly NHB. In addition, given that the 
pregnancy intention question is asked at the time of enroll- 
ment, which is between 18 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, when 
women have already chosen to carry their pregnancies to 
term, self-reports may not be wholly reliable. Pregnancy 
intention has the potential to change depending on when the 
woman is asked.21 We also may negatively bias our estimate 
of unwanted pregnancies because we fail to capture the 
women who decide to terminate the pregnancy before 18 
weeks as well as limit enrollment to women who are £ 28 
weeks pregnant, thereby eliminating women with unwanted 
pregnancies who may be more likely to initiate prenatal care 
late. We note, however, that the CDC’s intention question- 
naire within PRAMS, an important source of information on 
pregnancy intention in the United States, is implemented 
after delivery. Our sample is limited to women > 18 years of 
age, eliminating many teen pregnancies, which are a high- 
risk group for mistimed pregnancies. Considering 62% of 
our participants indicated an unintended pregnancy, the 
potential negative bias indicates that unintended pregnancy 
is a serious public health concern. 
Future research should explore the distinction between 
unwanted and mistimed pregnancies in other cohorts to 
conﬁrm the results presented here. In addition, research is 
needed to understand and prevent the high rates of un- 
wanted and mistimed pregnancies, with a particular em- 
phasis on unwanted pregnancies, given the greater risk these 
women pose. Additional barriers to pregnancy planning, 
beyond access to contraceptive services, should be identiﬁed 
so public health systems can effectively work on breaking 
down these barriers. Given the signiﬁcant numbers of un- 
wanted pregnancies that occur in multiparas (81% of the 
women in our unwanted group), 
intervention research 
aimed at high-risk women in the immediate postnatal period 
appears warranted. 
Additional studies are needed that reﬁne the measurement 
of pregnancy intention. Ideally, the question would be asked 
at pregnancy conﬁrmation, reducing the potential for recall 
bias. Quantifying the degree of mistiming of a pregnancy 
would be helpful, as a pregnancy that is 1 year earlier than 
desired is inherently different from one that is 10 years early. 
Asking women and their partners about the dimensions of 
intention (trying to get pregnant, happiness regarding preg- 
nancy)25 would clarify what it means for a pregnancy to be 
intended or unintended. 

Pregnancy intention is an important indicator of a woman’s 
readiness to bear a child, her mental and physical health, and 
her sociodemographic context. Although preventing unin- 
tended pregnancies remains an important public health ob- 
jective, understanding the contributors to unwanted and 
mistimed pregnancies elucidates large concurrent risk factors. 
In our cohort, women who report unwanted pregnancies, 
especially those who have recurring unwanted pregnancies, 
appear to be the most distinct and at highest risk. Having an 
unwanted pregnancy does not mean these women will not 
want or love their infant.43 However, knowing the demo- 
graphic and psychosocial risks, clinicians could make referrals 
for services so these women get the support they need to 
reduce stress and enhance resiliency. Preventing mistimed 
and unwanted pregnancies is important; further, in clinical 
practice, identifying the riskiest pregnancies and determining 
appropriate intervention strategies for the current pregnancy, 
subsequent interconceptual care, and maternal and child 
health are paramount.
