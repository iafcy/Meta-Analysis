Chronic anxiety 
Chronic depression 
Purpose: chronic poor mental health over the course of pregnancy contributes to greater adverse 
maternal and child outcomes. Identifying women with chronic depressive or anxiety symptoms can 
provide opportunities to reduce distress and improve pregnancy outcomes. The objective of this study 
was to determine risk factors of chronic antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms using a longitudinal 
pregnancy cohort in Alberta, Canada. 
Methods: women with singleton pregnancies were included (N¼ 3021). Anxiety and depressive symp- 
toms were measured in the second and third trimesters using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety 
Inventory and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, respectively. On the basis of the timing and 
persistence of symptoms, the following three mutually exclusive subgroups for each anxiety and 
depressive symptoms were created: never symptomatic, symptomatic only in the second trimester, 
and symptomatic at both time points. Separate logistic regression models were used to derive risk factors 
for each subgroup. 
Findings: women with chronic anxiety or depressive symptoms were distinguished from those with 
transient symptoms or no symptoms by their optimism scores, in which less optimistic pregnant women 
had a four-fold increased risk for developing chronic depressive or anxiety symptoms compared with 
more optimistic women (AOR varied from 4.30 to 4.93). Additionally, high perceived stress, low social 
support, history of mental health issues were common predictors of chronic anxiety and depressive 
symptoms in pregnancy. Partner tension was the exclusive predictor of anxiety symptoms (AOR varied 
from 1.94 to 2.31) and poor physical health (AOR 2.54; 95% CI 1.32–4.89), unplanned pregnancy (AOR 
3.05; 95% CI 1.61–5.79), and infertility treatments (AOR 4.98; 95% CI 1.85–13.39) were unique predictors 
of chronic depressive symptoms. 
Conclusions: knowledge of the risk factors of chronic poor mental health during pregnancy might inform 
the development of effective strategies within the limited resources of health-care systems to target 
populations with greater needs for interventions. 


Anxiety and depressive symptoms are common during preg- 
nancy. Up to one-third of women may experience anxiety symp- 
toms during pregnancy (Lee et al., 2007). The prevalence of 
depression varies from 7.4% in the ﬁrst trimester, to 12.8% in the 
second semester, and 12.0% in the third trimester (Bennett et al., 


Sheila.McDonald@albertahealthservices.ca (S. McDonald),

2004). The literature suggests that anxiety and depressive symp- 
toms are not static across the perinatal period (Sutter-Dallay et al., 
2012; Mora et al., 2009; Kuo et al., 2014) and symptoms for some 
women may be transitional and resolve over time, whereas these 
symptoms can persist in other women (Geller, 2004). Signiﬁcant 
heterogeneity in the timing and persistence of perinatal depres- 
sion has been reported and three distinct categories of women in 
regard to depressive symptoms have been identiﬁed: never 
symptomatic, chronically symptomatic, and only symptomatic at 
the antenatal or postpartum period (Sutter-Dallay et al., 2012; 
Mora et al., 2009). Similar evidence on antenatal anxiety 
is scarce with the exception of a recent study that reported

trajectories of the severity of anxiety symptoms ranging from very 
low to very high among women undergoing caesarean childbirth 
(Kuo et al., 2014). The heterogeneity of anxiety symptoms has been 
noted in other populations (Nandi et al., 2009). 
It is known that depression and anxiety can increase the risk of 
adverse pregnancy and child outcomes. The timing and duration of 
depressive and anxiety symptoms may be related to severity of 
adverse maternal and child health outcomes. For instance, in a 
longitudinal study, Chung et al. (2004) found that depressive 
symptomatology that persisted through the perinatal period was 
related to poor parenting practices (Chung et al., 2004). A link 
between antenatal anxiety and preterm birth, low birth weight 
(Littleton et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 2009; O'Donnell et al., 2011), 
and postpartum depression (Ahluwalia et al., 2004; Heron et al., 
2004; Skouteris et al., 2009) as well as the increased risk of delays 
in cognitive, behavioural, and psychomotor development and 
mental health problems in children (Buss et al., 2011; Davis and 
Sandman, 2012; Kingston et al., 2012; Loomans et al., 2012) has 
been reported. Alterations 
in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal 
cortical-axis activity, which is believed to play a role in forming 
the pathways of these adverse outcomes, have been shown to be 
related to chronic anxiety symptoms (Greaves-Lord et al., 2007). 
Roesch et al. (2004) found that pregnancy anxiety experienced at 
multiple time points over the course of pregnancy was associated 
with shorter gestation (Roesch et al., 2004). 
Demographic and psychosocial characteristics of pregnant 
women suffering from chronic mental health symptoms might 
differ from others. In a study by Mora et al. (2009), chronically 
depressed women were more likely to be multiparous and have 
moderate or high stress levels compared with other women (Mora 
et al., 2009). Evidence on risk factors of chronic mental health 
symptoms during the antenatal period is limited. With a few 
exceptions, previous studies on risk factors of antenatal depression 
and anxiety are cross-sectional with a single assessment of 
symptoms and do not address chronicity of symptoms or varia- 
tions related to pregnancy stages. Knowledge of the risk factors of 
chronic antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms can inform 
screening strategies to identify the at-risk group of women with a 
high need for interventions. This information might also aid in the 
development of more reﬁned models of mechanisms and causal 
pathways in which poor mental health leads to adverse outcomes. 
The aim of the current study was to identify the demographic, 
clinical, cognitive, and psychosocial predictors of transient and 
chronic depressive and anxiety symptoms in a community sample 
of pregnant women. 

Data for this study were obtained from the All Our Babies (AOB) 
cohort, an established longitudinal pregnancy cohort in Alberta, 
Canada, that has prospective questionnaire data on maternal 
mental health, health-care utilisation, birth outcomes, and post- 
partum experiences. Recruitment began in 2008 and ended in 
2010. Information on recruitment, data collection, and question- 
naires for the AOB study has been described in detail elsewhere 
(Gracie et al., 2010; McDonald et al., 2013). Data collection 
included repeat assessments using validated questionnaires and 
investigator/stakeholder questions. Participants completed three 
questionnaires, twice during pregnancy ( o25 weeks and 34–36 
weeks gestation) and once during the postpartum period (four 
months), and provided consent to link to their medical records. 
The cohort has been followed annually at 12, 24, and 36 months 
post partum. Cohort retention is greater than 80%. The study 
was approved by the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board of 
the University of Calgary. Participants provided informed consent 
at the time of recruitment and were provided copies for their 
records. 

Women with singleton pregnancies were included (N ¼3021). 
Anxiety was deﬁned as scoring above the established cut-off of 40 
on the state anxiety subscale of the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety 
Inventory (Spielberger and Gorsuch, 1983). The State Anxiety 
Inventory consists of 20 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 
1 (not at all) to 4 (very much so). This scale has been validated 
against clinical interviews during both the pregnancy and post- 
partum period and has been found to have acceptable sensitivity, 
speciﬁcity, and predictive values to determine cases of anxiety 
among a perinatal population (Grant et al., 2008; Meades and 
Ayers, 2011). Three mutually exclusive subgroups of anxiety were 
created based on the timing and persistence of symptoms: never 
symptomatic, symptomatic exclusively in the second trimester 
(o24 weeks), and symptomatic at both time points. Chronic 
anxiety was deﬁned as persistently high levels of anxiety symp- 
toms during both the second and third trimesters, whereas 
transient anxiety was deﬁned as anxiety symptoms exclusively 
during the second trimester. 
Depression was measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depres- 
sion Scale (EPDS), a 10-item self-report questionnaire. The scale 
has high reliability with an internal consistency of .87(Cox et al., 
1987). The EPDS has been validated for use in the antenatal period 
(Murray and Cox, 1990). A score greater than or equal to 13 has 
been recommended to identify women with symptoms of major 
depression (Gaynes et al., 2005). Similar to anxiety, the following 
three mutually exclusive subgroups of depression were created: 
never symptomatic, symptomatic exclusively in the second trime- 
ster (transient depression), and symptomatic at both time points 
(chronic depression). 
Variables that were considered potential predictors of antena- 
tal depression and anxiety were selected according to the litera- 
ture and through discussion with perinatal mental health 
professionals. Variables were grouped into the following domains: 
demographics (maternal age, marital status, education level, 
household income level, ethnicity, and time living in Canada), 
obstetrical and physical health status (gravidity, parity, pre- 
pregnancy BMI, reproductive history, timing of pregnancy, mode 
of conception, pre-existing chronic conditions, and physical health 
status), psychosocial (history of substance or alcohol abuse, history 
of abuse/neglect, history of mental health issues, partner tension, 
and social support in pregnancy), optimism as a cognitive variable, 
and perceived stress. 
Physical health status, social support, and perceived stress 
variables were measured in the second trimester. Physical health 
status was measured using the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey 
(SF-12v2), a shorter version of the SF-36v2 that covers the same 
eight health domains. This scale evaluates functional health and 
well-being from the patient's perspective and has two compo- 
nents: physical health (PCS) and mental health (MCS) functioning 
(Ware et al., 1996). The SF-12v2 has satisfactory validity and 
reliability, with Cronbach's alphas of .88 for the physical compo- 
nent summary and .82 for the mental component summary 
(Cheak-Zamora et al., 2009). In the present study, a score below 
the 20th percentile on the SF-12v2 physical component summary 
was deﬁned as a poor health status during pregnancy. 
The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Scale is a 
19-item self-report scale that measures four dimensions of social 
support: emotional/informational, tangible, affectionate, and posi- 
tive social interaction (Sherbourne and Stewart, 1991). For each 
item, participants are asked to indicate how often each type of 
support was available to them if needed by choosing one of ﬁve

options. Scores for each item vary from 1 to 5, and the possible 
total score ranges from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a greater 
perceived social support. The internal consistency of the overall 
support scale and all subscales is high, ranging from .91 to .97. 
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a ten-item scale that assesses 
the degree to which individuals perceive situations in their lives to 
be stressful. Participants are asked to rate how often they have felt 
or thought a certain way with response choices ranging from 
never to very often. The total score is determined by summing all 
items and ranges from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating more 
perceived stress. The scale has good internal consistency, with a 
Cronbach's alpha of .85 (Cohen et al., 1983). 
Dispositional optimism was measured by the Life-Orientation 
Test-Revised, a 10-item self-report scale. Each item is scored from 
0 to 4 based on the respondent's level of agreement with the item. 
Given that 4 of these10 items are ﬁllers and are therefore not used 
to derive a score, the total score ranges from 0 to 24. Higher scores 
indicate greater levels of optimism (Scheier et al., 1994). 
A past history of mental health problems was deﬁned as any 
self-reported depressive episode for greater than two weeks or 
other mental disorders, such as generalised anxiety disorder, 
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disor- 
der. Information on pre-existing medical conditions was obtained 
from the medical records. All remaining variables were assessed 
using single-item questions or combinations of single item survey 
questions. 

Descriptive statistics using frequencies and percentages were 
used to describe sample characteristics. χ2 analysis was used to 
assess bivariate associations between each category of depression 
and anxiety and demographic, obstetrical, cognitive, and psycho- 
social variables. Four separate logistic regression models were 
performed to derive risk factor proﬁles for transient anxiety, 
transient depression, chronic anxiety, and chronic depression. 
A hierarchal model building strategy was adopted with blocks of 
variables entered in the following order: demographic, obstetrical, 
psychosocial, cognitive, and perceived stress. Variables from each 
domain were considered for inclusion in the multivariable regres- 
sion models if they had signiﬁcant bivariate association at p ¼.20 
or if the variables were deemed clinically important regardless of 
statistical signiﬁcance. Further model building involved checking 
the independent effects of those factors previously removed from 
each block to ensure robustness of the ﬁnal models. Although our 
outcome variables included three categories, we did not perform 
multinomial regression analysis because separate regression ana- 
lyses allowed for building speciﬁc models for each subgroup. 
Adjusted odds ratios and 95% conﬁdence intervals were presented 
for all ﬁnal models, and an alpha level of .05 was used for 
statistical tests. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 
statistical software program, version 19.0 (IBM Corp, 2010). 

the occurrence of transient and chronic anxiety symptoms was 
higher than depression (Table 2). 
Bivariate analysis revealed that transient anxiety was asso- 
ciated with younger maternal age (o25) (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.54– 
3.71), household income o$40,000 (OR 2.29; 95% CI 1.60–3.26), 
household income of $40,000–$79,999 (OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.14–1.84), 
non-Caucasian ethnicity (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.22–1.95), new immi- 
grants (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.30–2.56), unplanned pregnancy (OR 1.87; 
95% CI 1.50–2.34), poor physical health status (OR 1.99; 95% CI 
1.57–2.51), history of abuse/neglect (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.55–2.36), 
history of substance abuse (OR 1.76; 95% CI 1.08–2.86), partner 
tension (OR 2.72; 95% CI 2.21–3.36), history of mental health 
issues (OR 2.32; 95% CI 1.90–2.84), low social support (OR 3.48; 
95% CI 2.64–4.59), being less-optimistic (OR 4.60; 95% CI 3.61– 
5.87), and high perceived stress (OR 6.65; 95% CI 5.23–8.47). With 
the exception of being a new immigrant and having a history of 
substance abuse, similar factors were associated with chronic 
anxiety symptoms. The ﬁnal multivariable regression models for 
transient and chronic anxiety are presented in Tables 3 and 4. High 
perceived stress, 
low social support, history of mental health 
issues, partner tension, and being less optimistic were predictors 
of chronic anxiety in pregnancy. 
Transient depressive symptoms were associated with younger 
maternal age (o 25) (OR 3.19; 95% CI 1.59–6.38), household 
income o$40,000 (OR 5.35 95% CI 3.35–8.55), household income 
of $40,000–$79,999 (OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.40–3.21), non-Caucasian 
ethnicity (OR 2.51; 95% CI 1.74–3.62), new immigrants (OR 2.07; 
95% CI 1.30–3.40), unplanned pregnancy (OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.21– 
2.59), infertility treatments (OR 3.40; 95% CI 4.07–10.79), poor 
physical health status (OR 2.08; 95% CI 1.42–3.06), history of 
substance abuse (OR 3.30; 95% CI 1.70–6.40), partner tension 
(OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.67–3.42), history of mental health issues (OR 
3.73; 95% CI 2.60–5.34), low social support in pregnancy (OR 6.44; 
95% CI 4.49–9.33), being less optimistic (OR 4.03; 95% CI 2.77– 
5.86), and high perceived stress (OR 34.43; 95% CI 21.29–55.69) at 
the bivariate level. In addition to these factors, poor reproductive 
history and pre-existing chronic conditions were associated with 
chronic depressive symptoms throughout pregnancy. The ﬁnal 
multivariable regression models for transient and chronic depres- 
sive symptoms are presented in Tables 5 and 6. Predictors of 
chronic depressive symptoms in the ﬁnal model included high 
perceived stress, 
low social support, history of mental health 
issues, poor physical health status, unplanned pregnancy, inferti- 
lity treatment, and being less optimistic. 
On the basis of ﬁnal models, women with chronic symptoms 
were distinguished from those with transient symptoms by their 
optimism scores in which less optimistic pregnant women had a 
four-fold increased risk for developing chronic depressive or 
anxiety symptoms compared with more optimistic women (AOR 
varied from 4.30 to 4.93). Partner tension was the exclusive 
predictor of anxiety symptoms (AOR varied from 1.94 to 2.31). 
Poor physical health (AOR 2.54; 95% CI 1.32–4.89), unplanned 
pregnancy (AOR 3.05; 95% CI 1.61–5.79), and infertility treatments 
(AOR 4.98; 95% CI 1.85–13.39) were unique predictors of chronic 
depressive symptoms. 
The majority of participants were between 25 and 34 years of 
age, married, Caucasian and were born in Canada or had lived in 
Canada for more than ﬁve years. Most participants had more than 
a high school education and reported an annual household income 
of at least $80,000 Canadian dollars (Table 1). These characteristics 
align with the pregnant and parenting population of an urban 
centre in Canada (McDonald et al., 2013). In total, 23% of women 
experienced anxiety on at least one occasion during pregnancy, 
whereas 11% of women reported depressive symptoms. Similarly, 

The aim of this study was to examine the risk factors of 
transient and chronic depressive and anxiety symptomatology in 
a community sample of over 3000 pregnant women in Alberta, 
Canada. A range of characteristics was independently associated 
with membership in each category of symptoms, including demo- 
graphic, obstetric, cognitive, and psychosocial variables and per- 
ceived stress. Some of these factors were widely shared across

categories regardless of the continuity of symptoms or stage of 
pregnancy. Three common risk factors of transient or chronic 
depressive and anxiety symptoms were high perceived stress, low 
social support, and a past history of mental health problems. The 
impact of these factors on maternal mental health is well-docu- 
mented; a past history of mental health problems is a major risk 
factor for perinatal anxiety and mood disorders (Giardinelli et al., 
2012; Goodman and Tyer-Viola, 2010) and the primary reason for 
referral to mental health services during the perinatal period 
(Sloan and Kirsh, 2008). Individuals with a history of poor mental 
health may have a more heightened response to stressful events 
than those without (Post, 1992). In our study, perceived stress was 
associated with both transient and chronic anxiety and depression, 
with the highest risks related to depression and chronic anxiety 
(AOR varied from 17.16 to 24.95). Some common stressors during 
pregnancy are low material resources, poor employment condi- 
tions, intense family and household responsibilities, tension in 
intimate relationships, and complications of pregnancy (Dunkel 
Schetter and Tanner, 2012). Low social support can limit the access 
and uptake of important resources that enhance resilience to 
integration, connectedness, and enacted 
stress, such as social 
support (Dunkel, 2011). A supportive social network can directly 
improve overall well-being both by buffering the impact of 
potentially adverse effects of stressful life events and by increasing 
the ability to cope with these stressors (Cohen and Wills, 1985). 
Nearly 90% of our community-based sample of pregnant 
women exhibited low depressive symptomology, and the majority

of elevated depressive symptoms were transient. Less than 3% of 
women experienced chronic depression. Anxiety rates were higher 
in all classes, and approximately 9% of women experienced chronic 
anxiety. These results call for more attention to antenatal anxiety, 
particularly given its adverse impact on pregnancy outcomes. 
The factor that distinguished transient symptoms from chronic 
conditions for both depressive and anxiety symptoms was dis- 
positional optimism. Pregnant women who were less optimistic 
had a four-fold increased risk to develop chronic depressive or 
anxiety symptoms compared with optimistic women. Disposi- 
tional optimism may directly reduce stress by inﬂuencing internal 
coping strategies and the cognitive adjustment to diverse stres- 
sors. A meta-analysis of 50 studies revealed that dispositional 
optimism was positively associated with coping strategies used to 
eliminate, reduce, or manage stressors or emotions and negatively 
associated with strategies intended to ignore, avoid, or withdraw 
from stressors or emotions (Nes and Segerstrom, 2006). In addi- 
tion, a positive vision of the future can affect a person's perception 
of control and indirectly reduce distress. In a study of distress in a 
sample of high-risk pregnant women, Lobel et al. (2002) found 
that optimistic women were more likely than non-optimistic 
women to perceive their pregnancy as controllable and use non- 
avoidant coping strategies. 
Lancaster et al. (2010) conducted a systematic review of 57 
studies to identify an overall trend of evidence of risk factors of 
depression during pregnancy. Similar to our study, they found that 
lack of social support and life stress were consistently related to an 
increased risk of depression during pregnancy. The reviewers also 
noted that signiﬁcant bivariate associations between history of 
depression, unplanned pregnancy, and lower income exist, but 
further research is needed to conﬁrm multivariate relationships 
(Lancaster et al., 2010). In our study, unplanned pregnancy and a 
history of mental health problems were predictors of chronic 
depressive symptoms, but low household income was not. 
Two previous studies have examined the risk factors of chronic 
depressive symptomology in the perinatal period. In contrast to 
our ﬁndings, Sutter-Dallay et al. (2012) reported associations 
between income and parity and chronic depression. One explana- 
tion for this contrasting ﬁnding is that their analysis did not 
account for perceived stress or psychosocial and cognitive vari- 
ables. Mora et al. (2009) examined the risk factors of chronic 
depression in a prospective cohort study; consistent with our 
ﬁndings, they noted that high or medium stress is related to 
chronic depression. Similar to our study, they did not ﬁnd 
associations between chronic depression and maternal age, mar- 
ital status, or health behaviours (Mora et al., 2009). 
We are not aware of other studies that have examined the risk 
factors of chronic anxiety symptoms throughout pregnancy. In a 
longitudinal study, Lee et al. (2007) examined anxiety risk factors 
at each trimester of pregnancy and noted variations in demo- 
graphic and obstetric factors, such as age, parity, marital status, 
and history of smoking and drinking. Buist et al. (2011) conducted 
a cohort study to determine the association between demographic 
and psychosocial factors and continuity of generalised anxiety 
disorder (GAD) from preconception to pregnancy in four groups of 
women: no history of GAD, pre-pregnancy GAD, GAD only during 
pregnancy, and GAD during both pre-pregnancy and pregnancy. 
They found that women with both pre-pregnancy and pregnancy 
anxiety constituted a unique group and were more likely to have 
low levels of support and education as well as a history of 
childhood abuse (Buist et al., 2011). 
low social 
support was a predictor of chronic anxiety. We found associations 
between chronic anxiety and history of abuse (OR 2.04; 95% CI 
1.54–2.70) and education (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.21–2.66) at a bivariate 
level; however, these associations did not remain signiﬁcant in 
multivariate analysis. 

Some variables were more uniquely related to a particular 
category of symptoms. For example, demographic variables predicted 
only transient depression or anxiety. Physical health status and 
obstetrical factors, 
including unplanned pregnancy, were unique 
predictors of chronic depression. Generally, the rates of unplanned 
pregnancy are higher among women with a mental health problem 
(Takahashi et al., 2012). Women with an unplanned pregnancy also 
have an increased risk for discontinuing mental health treatment 
after the conﬁrmation of pregnancy compared with women with a 
planned pregnancy (Roca et al., 2013). Although not directly exam- 
ined in our study, it is possible that the combined effects of the 
discontinuation of treatment, excessive stress about the inﬂuence of 
medications on pregnancy, and a fear of symptoms relapse during 
pregnancy, labour, or the postpartum period contribute to emotional 
distress among women with unplanned pregnancies. 
Partner tension was a unique predictor for both transient and 
chronic anxiety. A poor quality marital relationship, particularly in 
conjunction with other stressors, such as ﬁnancial difﬁculties, is a 
strong predictor for antenatal anxiety (Nasreen et al., 2011). Although 
there is the possibility of a bidirectional association between anxiety 
and partnership tension in which elevated anxiety may result in more 
relationship conﬂict, preliminary evidence suggests a unidirectional 
association. In a longitudinal study, Whisman et al. (2011) examined 
the association between relationship adjustment and symptoms of 
anxiety and depression among a sample of pregnant women with a 
past history of depression. They reported a unidirectional association 
between lower relationship adjustment and higher anxiety levels at 
the next assessment (Whisman et al., 2011). However, they found a 
bidirectional, recursive association between depression and low 
relationship adjustment (Whisman et al., 2011). In our study, bivariate 
associations between partner tension and depression emerged but 
were not signiﬁcant in multivariable analysis. Similarly, Lancaster et al. 
(2010) found a bivariate trend of association between depression and 
poor relationship quality in a review of evidence; however, at the 
multivariable level, they did not observe such a relationship. 
Despite the substantial sample size and the length of follow-up, 
there are a few methodological limitations in this study. Single 
mothers constituted a small percentage of the sample; therefore, 
the analysis might not have sufﬁcient power to detect the 
inﬂuence of marital status on mental health. 
In our sample, 
approximately 10% of women with a history of mental health 
problems reported taking prescription medications for their men- 
tal health condition during pregnancy. Our data, however, did not 
include detailed information about the timing, duration, or com- 
pliance of the treatment. Although the mean anxiety and depres- 
sion scores were not signiﬁcantly different between women taking 
medications in our sample and those not taking medications, this 
remains a limitation of the study. 

Identifying pregnant women who experience chronic anxiety 
or depressive symptoms can help target resources within health- 
care systems to serve this high-needs population. The ﬁnding with 
the clearest clinical importance is that women with lower levels of 
optimism are at greater risk for chronic depressive or anxiety 
symptoms during pregnancy. If these ﬁndings are conﬁrmed with 
further research, the inclusion of the measure of optimism in 
routine assessments could distinguish women at risk of chronic 
symptoms from those with transient symptoms. 
Our results also emphasise the importance of understanding 
relationship dynamics in the preconception and early pregnancy 
periods to address maternal anxiety. Simple interventions, such as 
brief cognitive behavioural therapy to improve communications 
between partners, might reduce anxiety symptoms. The associa- 
tion between poor physical health status, obstetric variables, and

chronic depression suggests that women with pregnancy compli- 
cations should be monitored closely. 

Our ﬁndings conﬁrm that pregnant women represent a hetero- 
geneous group in terms of the chronicity of anxiety and depressive 
symptoms and that some of the characteristics of women with 
chronic poor mental health are different from other pregnant 
women. These results may inform the development of strategies to 
appropriately target limited resources of health-care systems for 
populations with chronic poor mental health problems and 
greater needs for interventions to improve maternal and child 
outcomes related to poor mental health.
