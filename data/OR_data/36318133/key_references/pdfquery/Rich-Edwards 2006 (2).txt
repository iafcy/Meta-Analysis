Objective: Data are scarce regarding the sociodemographic predictors of antenatal and postpartum 
depression. This study investigated whether race/ethnicity, age, finances, and partnership status were 
associated with antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms. 
Setting: 1662 participants in Project Viva, a US cohort study. 
Design: Mothers indicated mid-pregnancy and six month postpartum depressive symptoms on the 
Edinburgh postpartum depression scale (EPDS). Associations of sociodemographic factors with odds of 
scoring .12 on the EPDS were estimated. 
Main results: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 9% at mid-pregnancy and 8% postpartum. 
Black and Hispanic mothers had a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms compared with non- 
Hispanic white mothers. These associations were explained by lower income, financial hardship, and 
higher incidence of poor pregnancy outcome among minority women. Young maternal age was 
associated with greater risk of antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms, largely attributable to the 
prevalence of financial hardship, unwanted pregnancy, and lack of a partner. The strongest risk factor for 
antenatal depressive symptoms was a history of depression (OR = 4.07; 95% CI 3.76, 4.40), and the 
strongest risk for postpartum depressive symptoms was depressive symptoms during pregnancy (6.78; 
4.07, 11.31) or a history of depression before pregnancy (3.82; 2.31, 6.31). 
Conclusions: Financial hardship and unwanted pregnancy are associated with antenatal and postpartum 
depressive symptoms. Women with a history of depression and those with poor pregnancy outcomes are 
especially vulnerable to depressive symptoms during the childbearing year. Once these factors are taken 
in account, minority mothers have the same risk of antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms as 
white mothers.

women during their lifetime, and is a leading cause of 
morbidity among women.5 Pregnancy and the post- 
partum months may be windows of heightened vulnerability 
to depression. Antenatal and postpartum depression are 
associated with marital discord and low social, emotional, 
and cognitive competence among offspring.2–5 
Despite advances in understanding the causes of major 
depression, 
the predictors of antenatal and postpartum 
depressive symptoms remain poorly understood. Major 
depression in women is associated with poor social support, 
marital conflict, adverse life events, and low maternal 
education.6 Poverty is a powerful predictor of major depres- 
sion, with incidence rates two to three times higher among 
lowest socioeconomic groups.7 8 Several stressors associated 
with major depression also predict depression during the 
childbearing year. Primary among these are adverse life 
events and poor social support.9–12 
There is more debate, and less data, with regard to 
sociodemographic risk factors for antenatal and postpartum 
depression. Although several studies report no association of 
socioeconomic position with antenatal and postpartum 
depression,13–18 others conducted in impoverished areas report 
depression rates as high as 25% during pregnancy and 20% or 
more postpartum.11 19 20 Large epidemiological surveys have 
shown that white persons and Hispanics may be more 
vulnerable to major depression uncomplicated by other 
illness, while black persons are especially prone to comorbid 
depression.21–23 Almost no studies, however, have examined 
how antenatal and postpartum depression vary across racial 
and ethnic groups, and the extent to which such variation is 
explained by socioeconomic position. We determined to 
investigate sociodemographic predictors of antenatal and 
postpartum depressive symptoms 
in a large obstetrics 
practice. 
METHODS 
Project Viva is a prospective cohort study of pregnancy 
outcomes and maternal and child health.24 25 Participants 
were recruited at their first prenatal visit to one of eight 
obstetric practices associated with Harvard Vanguard Medical 
Associates, a large group practice in urban and suburban 
Boston. This analysis used data collected at enrolment (at a 
mean 10 weeks’ gestation), mid-pregnancy (28 weeks’ 
gestation), and at six months postpartum. 
Of 2128 Project Viva participants who delivered a live 
infant, 1662 (78%) completed a mid-pregnancy questionnaire 
that assessed history of depression as well as current 
depressive symptoms with a 10 item Edinburgh postpartum 
depressive symptoms scale (EPDS).26 At six months post- 
partum, 1278 respondents (77% of the cohort that completed 
the mid-pregnancy questionnaire) completed a second EPDS. 
We chose the EPDS because it has been validated for both 
antenatal and postpartum use.26–28 The EPDS focuses on 
cognitive and affective symptoms, avoiding the inflation of 
prevalence by physical symptoms (such as fatigue and

physical discomfort) typical of normal pregnancy and the 
postpartum.9 29 An EPDS score above 12 indicates probable 
depression.29–31 Validation of the EPDS against diagnostic 
interviews indicated a specificity of 78% and a 
clinical 
sensitivity of 86%.26 While a score of more than 12 on the 
EPDS does not confirm depression, factors that predict an 
EPDS score above this threshold probably predict clinically 
significant depression. 
We measured history of depressive symptoms before 
pregnancy with the question, ‘‘Before this pregnancy, was 
there ever a period of time when you were feeling depressed 
or down or when you lost interest in pleasurable activities 
most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 weeks?’’ There 
were 309 women (19%) who endorsed this question. A 
history of depression required an endorsement of 
the 
symptom question plus either an indication that she saw a 
health care professional who said she was depressed or an 
indication that a health care professional had prescribed her a 
medication for depression. By this definition, 185 (11%) 
women had a history of depression. Concerned that women 
with lower socioeconomic status might be less likely to 
receive professional diagnosis or treatment of depression, we 
also considered history of depressive symptoms without 
treatment or diagnosis. 

We measured by interview and questionnaire risk factors 
for depression. Maternal age, 
immigrant 
status, household income, education, maternal employment 
status, cigarette smoking, pre-pregnant body mass index (kg/ 
m2), partnership status, and pregnancy intention/wantedness 
were recorded at enrolment, typically in the first trimester. 
Pregnancy intention/wantedness was assessed with the 
question: 
‘‘Regarding this pregnancy: (a) I was actively 
trying to become pregnant; (b) I was not actively trying, but I 
was glad to become pregnant; (c) I wanted to be pregnant 
someday, but not now; or (d) I did not want to be pregnant 
now or at any time in the future’’. Because of small numbers, 
we collapsed both ‘‘not now’’ responses into one category 
that represented 5% of respondents. As teen motherhood and 
childbearing before the typical age of college graduation were 
rare in this cohort, we considered as the youngest age group 
mothers under the age of 23 years (74 participants, or 4% of 
the cohort). We chose this age cut off point because it 
represented the age at which a woman might bear a child 
after having completed four years of post-high school 

education. Social support was recorded at mid-pregnancy, 
using short questionnaire scales that measured emotional 
and material support from a partner and, separately, from 
family or friends.32 Offspring birth weight was extracted from 
hospital delivery records. At six months postpartum, when 
the EPDS was readministered, we again recorded partnership 
status, body mass index, cigarette smoking, household 
income, financial hardship, maternal employment, as well 
as resumption of menstrual cycles, breast feeding, social 
support, postpartum physical symptoms, and quantity of 
maternal and infant sleep. Postpartum financial hardship 
was defined as a ‘‘no’’ response to any of the following items, 
‘‘Since your baby was born, have you always had enough 
money to: (a) buy infant formula; (b) buy baby food; (c) buy 
nappies (diapers); (d) buy food; (e) pay rent or mortgage.’’ 
We used multiple imputation to account 
for missing 
independent variables.33 This study was approved by the 
human subjects committee of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. 

Statistical analysis 
We built 
for the 
logistic regression models to account 
independent and confounding effects of many variables. 
We sought to include only variables that were either (1) a 
race/ethnicity, 
main exposure under 
immigrant status, household income, financial hardship, 
partnership status) or (2) theoretical or empirical confoun- 
ders of the main exposures (such as parity or delivery of a low 
birthweight infant). Where information is lacking on the 
relative to onset of 
exact 
depressive symptoms, it can be murky to discover if the 
‘‘exposures’’ might in fact be the result of a history of 
depressive symptoms. For example, could current partnership 
status be a result of previous depressive symptoms? Did 
depressive symptoms start before or after the conception of 
an unintended pregnancy? We therefore performed second- 
ary analyses to test whether exposure-outcome relations were 
similar among women without a history of depression or 
depressive symptoms.

months postpartum, 8% of participants scored .12 on the 
EPDS. There were 1278 participants who responded to both 
the antenatal and postpartum questionnaires: among these 
women, 31% of women with antenatal depressive symptoms 
also suffered from postpartum depressive symptoms. In 
contrast, only 6% without antenatal depressive symptoms 
experienced postpartum depressive symptoms. 

Risk factors for depressive symptoms 
Table 1 shows 
risk factors. These 
unadjusted statistics show higher prevalence of depressive 
symptoms among mothers who were younger, less educated, 
with fewer financial resources, without a spouse or cohabi- 
tating partner, and those who delivered low birthweight 
infants. Before adjusting for other factors associated with 
minority status, it seemed that there was a higher prevalence 
of depressive symptoms among black and Hispanic mothers. 
The remaining analysis focused on identifying which of these 
were independent risk factors for depressive symptoms. 
Predictors of antenatal depressive symptoms 
Table 2 shows models built to investigate predictors of 
antenatal depressive symptoms. In a basic model including 
maternal age, race/ethnicity, immigrant status, and parity 
(model 1), we found decreasing risks of antenatal depressive 
symptoms with increasing maternal age, with the youngest 
mothers (,23 years) at two or more times the risk of 
depressive symptoms compared with older mothers. In this 
naive model, black and Hispanic mothers seemed to be at 
increased risk of antenatal depressive symptoms. However, 
further adjustment for household income (model 2) dam- 
pened the associations of maternal age and race/ethnicity 
with antenatal depressive symptoms. 
We further adjusted for partnership status and pregnancy 
intention in model 3. Lack of a spouse or cohabitating partner 
and unwanted pregnancy doubled the risk of second 
trimester depressive symptoms. Accounting for these factors 
in model 3 reduced the risk associated with young mother- 
hood and minority status. Further adjustment for maternal

symptoms as employed women, whether they were seeking 
work (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 0.64, 1.95) or not (OR = 0.90, 95% 
CI 0.47, 1.72). 
We considered first trimester social support from family/ 
friends and from partner (model 4), both of which were 
associated with reduced risk of antenatal depressive symp- 
toms in the second trimester, although only support from 
family and friends was statistically significantly related to 
antenatal depressive symptoms. Adjustment for social sup- 
port dampened, but did not eliminate, the risk of antenatal 
depressive symptoms associated with being unpartnered or 
carrying an unwanted pregnancy. There was little evidence of 
race or age associations in model 4. 
A history of any depressive symptoms before pregnancy 
(age adjusted OR = 4.51, 95% CI 4.24, 4.80) and of diagnosed 
or treated depression (age adjusted OR = 4.07, 95% CI 3.76, 
4.40) were potent risk factors for antenatal depressive 
symptoms. We reasoned that a history of depression or 
depressive symptoms before pregnancy might adversely 
influence partnership status or pregnancy intention, each of 
which was associated with antenatal depressive symptoms in 
this cohort. To examine whether these factors affected risk of 
antenatal depressive symptoms independent of any associa- 
tion with prepregnancy depression, we reran model 3 among 
the group of 1353 women who reported no history of 
depression or depressive symptoms before pregnancy, among 
whom 84 (6%) reported a first onset of depressive symptoms 
during pregnancy. We found slightly weaker associations of 
partnership status (OR = 2.08; 0.90, 4.84) and unwanted 
pregnancy (1.89; 0.88, 4.09) with risk of antenatal depressive 
symptoms among women with no history of depression 
before pregnancy, compared with the full cohort (ORs of 2.34 
and 2.31, respectively, in model 3 in table 2). 
Predictors of postpartum depressive symptoms 
Table 3 shows models built to identify sociodemographic 
predictors of depressive symptoms at six months postpartum. 
As with antenatal depression, we again found increased risk 
of postpartum depressive symptoms among the youngest 
mothers (model 5). While black and Hispanic mothers 
seemed to be at higher risk of postpartum depressive 
symptoms, these associations lacked statistical significance. 
Having delivered a low birthweight infant conferred a nearly 
threefold higher risk of postpartum depressive symptoms; 
this explained a small portion of the increased risk associated 
with young maternal age and minority status (model 6). In 
model 7, we added a measure of financial hardship that more 
than tripled the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms. 
Household income (model 7) had an inconsistent association 
with postpartum depressive symptoms (whether or not the 
financial hardship term was in the model). These financial 
factors explained all of the apparent higher risk among black 
mothers and much of the higher risk seen among Hispanic 
mothers, and a portion of the risk associated with young 
motherhood. Partnership status and pregnancy intention 
were not associated with postpartum depressive symptoms. 
Further adjustment for cigarette smoking, breast feeding, 
return of menses, infant sleeping hours, postpartum physical 
symptoms (haemorrhoids, incontinence, varicose veins, pain 
during sex, sciatica, sore breasts, or back pain), postpartum 
body mass index, or history of depression of depressive 
symptoms before or during the pregnancy did not materially 
change these findings. While mothers who were not working 
outside the home and mothers on maternity leave were at the 
same risk of postpartum depressive symptoms as employed 
mothers, those who were looking for work were more likely 
to have postpartum depressive symptoms (OR = 2.35; 1.00, 
5.49, compared with employed mothers). 
Although partnership status did not seem to determine 
postpartum depressive symptoms, social support from a 
partner had a strong protective association with postpartum 
depressive symptoms, as did social support from family and 
friends (model 8). When these social support factors were 
added to the model (model 9), the risk associated with 
hardship decreased considerably, suggesting that the impact 
of financial hardship on postpartum depressive symptoms 
may be partly explained by low social support that may 
accompany or predate hardship. 
A history of undiagnosed depressive symptoms before 
pregnancy (OR = 3.37; 2.14, 5.29), diagnosed or treated pre- 
pregnancy depression (OR = 3.82; 2.31, 6.31) or antenatal 
depressive symptoms (OR = 6.78; 4.07, 11.31) conferred a 
several-fold higher risk of postpartum depressive symptoms. 
When we ran model 8 among the 1051 mothers with no 
history of depressive symptoms before or during pregnancy, 
financial hardship remained a risk factor (OR = 4.05; 1.6, 
9.83) for postpartum depressive symptoms, but low birth- 
weight did not (OR = 1.45; 0.40,5.28). 
DISCUSSION 
We saw a 9% prevalence of antenatal depressive symptoms, 
which is on the lower side of the 9% to 15% prevalence of 
antenatal depressive symptoms reported by other studies 
using the EPDS.31 34 Other studies, using a variety of 
depression assessment tools, have reported antenatal depres- 
sion prevalences of 9%–28% for predominantly middle class 
samples11 19 35 and 25%–50%11 19 36 for low income popula- 
tions. The somewhat lower prevalence in our population 
probably reflects both the specificity of the EPDS and the 
comparatively high socioeconomic position of our cohort. 
Although our study is one of the first to report a higher 
prevalence of antenatal depressive symptoms among minor- 
ity and young mothers, 
these associations were largely 
explained by differences in income, partnership status, and 
pregnancy intention. We saw a roughly 30% higher pre- 
valence of antenatal depressive symptoms among women 
with household incomes below $40 000, although this did 
not reach statistical significance. However, the higher risk is 
consistent with several studies20 35 37 that have reported high 
prevalence of antenatal depression among women of lower 
socioeconomic position. We also found a twofold increased 
risk of antenatal depressive symptoms with unwanted 
pregnancy, which we believe has not been previously 
examined. By far the most powerful risk factor for depressive 
symptoms during pregnancy was a history of prior depres- 
sion, which conferred a fourfold increased risk of antenatal 
depressive symptoms, similar to that reported in a small 
study of Norwegian mothers.1 
Few studies have examined race/ethnicity as a risk factor 
for postpartum depression. As with antenatal depression, the 
higher prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms that 
we saw among minority mothers was explained by financial 
hardship. Although some studies report no associations of 
postpartum depression with socioeconomic position,11 39 
others have found that financial difficulties,19 29 unemploy- 
ment,11 38 or low education36 are more prevalent among 
women with postpartum depression. We saw a nearly 
threefold increased risk of postpartum depression among

mothers who had low birthweight 
infants. One study 
reported increased risk of postpartum depression with poor 
infant health,36 but another found reduced risk of depression 
among women who had delivered before term.29 The single 
strongest risk factor for postpartum depressive symptoms 
was depressive symptoms during pregnancy, as has been seen 
consistently.34 40 
To the extent that depressive symptoms before, during, and 
after pregnancy represent a consistent underlying depressive 
syndrome, it is possible that depressive symptoms preceding 
pregnancy might increase social and economic risk (such as 
unemployment or lack of a partner); if this were the case, 
these social and economic risks might seem as spurious 
‘‘predictors’’ of antenatal and postpartum depression. To our 
knowledge, no study has examined whether these risk factors 
predict depressive symptoms among women with no history 
of depressive symptoms. Lack of a partner and unwanted 
pregnancy remained associated with antenatal depressive 
symptoms among women with no history of depressive 
symptoms, suggesting that the risks associated with partner- 
ship status and pregnancy intention are not spurious 
artefacts of an antecedent depressive symptoms. For post- 
partum depressive symptoms, financial hardship was a risk 
factor whether or not women had experienced prior 
depressive symptoms, suggesting that poverty precedes 
postpartum depression, rather than the alternative that 
depression leads to poverty. 
This study had several limitations. Chief among these is 
our reliance on a self reported screen of depressive symptoms, 
rather than clinician diagnosis. Although the EPDS has been 
it remains 
validated in a broad range of populations,41 
possible that cultural and/or economic factors may have 
caused women to over-report or under-report depressive 
symptoms. Social desirability bias may particularly affect 
minority42 and lower socioeconomic participants,43 leading 
them to under-report symptoms of depression,42 and us to 
underestimate associations between these factors and 
depressive symptoms. The timing of exposures and the onset 
of depressive symptoms is not established for every exposure; 
in particular, the examination of social support and depres- 
sion is effectively cross sectional and should be interpreted 
with caution (as in most other studies). While 23% of the 
cohort who responded to the mid-pregnancy questionnaire 
did not return the postpartum questionnaire, the proportion 
responding was similar among those with (75%) and without 
(77%) depression mid-pregnancy. This suggests that non- 
response neither substantially reduced our estimate of the 
prevalence of depression, nor created bias in ascertaining 
predictors of depression. If anything, the higher loss to follow 

up among minority and disadvantaged mothers might have 
caused us to slightly underestimate associations between 
lower socioeconomic status and depressive symptoms. 
In summary, we found that maternal race/ethnicity is not 
an independent predictor of antenatal or postpartum 
depressive symptoms. Instead, the apparently higher risk 
among minority women seems to result from financial 
hardship and, for postpartum depressive symptoms, poor 
risk of antenatal and 
pregnancy outcome. The higher 
postpartum depressive symptoms associated with young 
maternal age is largely explained by financial hardship, 
unwanted pregnancy, and lack of a partner. The fact that 
financial hardship and partnership status predicted depres- 
sive symptoms among women with no history of depressive 
symptoms suggests that these factors are likely to predate, 
and perhaps cause, depression during pregnancy and the 
postpartum.
