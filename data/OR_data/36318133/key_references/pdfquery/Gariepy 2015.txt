Objective—Investigate whether unplanned or poorly timed pregnancies (self-reported at 
enrollment) are associated with preterm or small for gestational age births. 

Setting—Offices (n=137) providing prenatal care in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts 
March 2005 to May 2009. 



Results—In adjusted analyses, pregnancy planning was not significantly associated with preterm 
(Odds Ratio 1.18, 95%CI 0.85-1.65) nor small for gestational age birth (Odds Ratio 1.17, 95%CI 
0.69-1.97). Similarly, poorly timed pregnancies were not significantly associated with preterm 
(Odds Ratio 0.85, 95%CI 0.53-1.38) nor small for gestational age birth (Odds Ratio 0.92, 95%CI

0.65-1.29). Combining pregnancy planning (yes/no) and timing (yes/no) into a 4-level category 
showed no significant association with preterm birth or small for gestational age. 
Conclusion(s)—In a large cohort with antenatally assessed pregnancy planning and timing, 
outcome data collected from medical record abstraction, and robust analysis adjusting for multiple 
confounding factors including maternal demographics, medical conditions, and other risk factors, 
neither pregnancy planning nor pregnancy timing showed a significant association with preterm or 
small for gestational age infants. This study improves upon previous analyses that lack adjustment 
for confounding, and use retrospective self-reporting to assess pregnancy planning and timing, and 
preterm and small for gestational age birth. Findings may differ in higher risk populations with 
higher prevalence of preterm or small for gestational age births. 
Capsule—Neither pregnancy planning nor timing showed a significant association with preterm 
or small for gestational age births in this large prospective cohort controlling for confounders. 



Unplanned pregnancy, which includes pregnancies that are unintended, mistimed, or 
unwanted, is common (1, 2). More than half (51%) of all pregnancies in the U.S. are 
unplanned (1). The burden of unplanned pregnancy is highest among women ages 18 to 24; 
women who were cohabiting but not married; women whose income is below the poverty 
line; women with less than a high school diploma; and Black or Hispanic women (1). 
Unplanned pregnancies that result in live births (60% of unplanned pregnancies and 40% of 
all births) (1-3) have been associated with a variety of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes 
including delayed prenatal care, increased physical violence during pregnancy, depression, 
reduced breastfeeding, decreased inter-pregnancy intervals, lower likelihood of advanced 
educational attainment and higher likelihood of behavioral issues for children from 
unplanned pregnancies (4-7). 
Whether unplanned pregnancy is associated with preterm birth and/or delivery of a small for 
gestational age (SGA) or low birth weight infant is not clear. While there is support for an 
association between unplanned pregnancy and either preterm birth (7-17), SGA, or low birth 
weight (3,10,11,13,14,17-22), not all studies agree (15,23-27). More clearly understanding 
risk factors for preterm and SGA births is a public health priority. 
Preterm birth, defined as a live birth before 37 completed weeks gestation, is the leading 
cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in developed countries (28). In fact, more infants 
(35%) die from preterm-related problems, including low birth weight, than from any other 
single cause in the U.S. (29). Preterm birth also significantly increases the risk of cerebral 
palsy, vision impairment, cognitive or hearing impairment (30). 
In 2012, approximately 1 in 9 infants (11.6% of live births) was born preterm in the U.S. 
(31). The disparity in demographic distribution of preterm birth mirrors the pattern for 



unplanned pregnancy. The U.S. rate of preterm birth is highest for non-Hispanic black 
infants (16.8%), followed by Native Americans (13.6%), Hispanics (11.7%), whites (10.5%) 
and Asians (10.3%) (31,32). Preterm birth is highest among women with a history of 
preterm birth; women younger than 18 or older than 40 years of age; women with income 
below the poverty line; women with less than a high school diploma; and women with 
increased stress during pregnancy (31,32). Birth weight is another important predictor of 
infant health, and SGA may be associated with intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal morbidity 
and mortality (31, 33). Studies that explore the impact of pregnancy planning and timing on 
birth outcomes are vulnerable to false associations if they do not take these critical socio- 
economic and demographic factors into consideration. 
We sought to gain a better understanding of the relationship between unplanned or poorly 
timed pregnancy and preterm or SGA birth, and variables (e.g. depression, anxiety, stress, 
social support) that affect this relationship. We hypothesized that women with unplanned or 
poorly timed pregnancies would have a higher risk of preterm birth and SGA. By 
investigating this relationship, there may be an opportunity to identify individual women 
with unplanned or poorly timed pregnancy and develop interventions to decrease the risk of 
preterm or SGA birth. And if pregnancy planning and timing are associated with preterm or 
SGA births, decreasing unplanned or poorly timed pregnancies could be a potentially 
effective strategy for decreasing the national preterm birth rate. By prospectively assessing 
pregnancy planning and timing prior to delivery, collecting outcome data from medical 
record abstraction instead of birth certificate data or retrospective survey responses from 
parents, and performing robust adjustments for multiple confounding factors including 
maternal demographics, medical conditions, and other risk factors, our analysis adds to and 
improves upon the previous literature. 


We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study designed to explore the 
associations of major depressive episodes and/or antidepressant medication use in pregnancy 
with adverse birth outcomes, including the risk for preterm birth (34,35). To be eligible for 
the study, women had to be at least 18 years of age (16 at the Yale site), less than 18 weeks 
estimated gestational age with a singleton pregnancy, speak English or Spanish, and have 
access to a telephone. Women with insulin-dependent diabetes, plans to terminate their 
pregnancy, or intention to relocate were ineligible. Study size was calculated to show a 2- 
fold difference in preterm birth among women exposed to depression or antidepressant 
medication, compared to those who were not exposed, with 85% power assuming a 5% 
preterm birth rate (34). Detailed study methods, including recruitment, enrollment and 
assessment procedures, staff training and quality control, have been described previously 
(34,35). Yale University School of Medicine and participating hospitals provided human 
subjects approval for the study. 
Study staff recruited and enrolled pregnant women receiving prenatal care from 137 
obstetrical practices and hospital-based clinics in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts 
between March 2005 and May 2009. Study follow-up continued until September 2009. 



After verbal consent was obtained, staff administered a screening questionnaire to collect 
information on gestational age, current mood, lifetime and current mood and anxiety 
disorders, antidepressant treatment, and exclusion criteria. In order to meet the study’s 
primary goal of exploring associations between major depressive episodes and/or 
antidepressant medication use in pregnancy with adverse birth outcomes, all women who 
met the above criteria and had a current or recent major depressive episode, post-traumatic 
stress disorder, or were undergoing antidepressant treatment, and a randomly selected 
comparator group with none of those characteristics. 
After enrolled participants gave written consent for interviews and medical record review, 
study staff conducted an initial home interview before 18 weeks estimated gestational age 
(EGA). Staff also interviewed participants by phone at 28 (± 2) weeks gestation and 8 (± 4) 
weeks after delivery. All staff interviewers received extensive training including at least 4 
days of instruction and 4 supervised interviews. 

At the initial interview, interviewers obtained data on demographic and potential 
confounding variables, including mental health outcomes (e.g. depression, post-traumatic 
stress disorder) perceived stress, and social support. Maternal age, race, ethnicity, education, 
marital status, parity, pregnancy history including previous preterm birth, tobacco use, 
alcohol use, other illicit drug use, and medication use was collected. The Edinburgh 
Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the modified Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) 
Symptom Scale, the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale, and the modified Kendler Social Support 
Interview (MKSSI) were administered at the first visit (36-39). The Cohen Perceived Stress 
Scale evaluates the degree to which individuals feel that life events are unpredictable and 
uncontrollable (38).38 The modified PTSD Symptom Scale assesses the presence and 
severity of DSM-IV PTSD symptoms related to a single identified traumatic event in 
individuals (37). The MKSSI is a reliable and valid tool for assessing social support 
(emotional and instrumental support) in pregnant women (39). 
At each of the three interviews, participants answered questions about major depressive 
disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder 
from the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview v2.1 (WMH- 
CIDI) (40). The WMH-CIDI is a valid and reliable lay interview instrument whether 
administered in person or over the telephone, is acceptable for use in pregnant women, and 
is further described in previous publications regarding this study (34,35). A standard 
algorithm was used to determine whether a participant met criteria for a major depressive 
episode during pregnancy. Perceived stress, and social support were not assessed at the 
second or third visit. 
We measured our exposure of interest at the first study visit (before 18 weeks EGA). 
Interviewers assessed pregnancy intention by asking women whether their pregnancy was 
planned (“Was this pregnancy planned? Yes/No”), and whether they thought it was a good 
time for them to be pregnant (“Do you think this is a good time for you to be pregnant? Yes/ 
No”). 



Medical-record reviewers, who were masked from interview information, abstracted data on 
outcomes of preterm birth and SGA infants from hospital records. We used standard of care 
definitions for outcome measurement. Preterm birth was defined as delivery before 37 
completed weeks of pregnancy (41). Gestational age was verified by a first-trimester 
ultrasound where available, last menstrual period, due date set by a physician, or earliest 
prenatal ultrasound. SGA refers to newborns whose birth weight is less than the 10th 
percentile for gestational age (33). 

We used bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the association of 
pregnancy planning and timing with preterm and SGA birth, and calculated unadjusted and 
adjusted odds ratios, controlling for potential confounding variables. We identified possible 
demographic factors (chosen a priori) that might confound the relationship between 
pregnancy planning or timing and preterm or SGA birth. Use of tobacco, alcohol or illicit 
drugs, depression (major depression 6 months before pregnancy and/or during pregnancy), 
and stress are all correlates of pregnancy planning/timing, preterm birth and SGA 
(1,21,41-47). Mother’s age, education, race, marital status, gravidity, history of preterm 
birth, history of sexual abuse prior to age 18, and social support are all correlates of both 
pregnancy planning/timing and preterm birth (1,5,41,42,46-51). Use of selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor during pregnancy, panic disorder during pregnancy, benzodiazepine use 
during pregnancy, and post-traumatic stress disorder before pregnancy are correlated with 
depression and preterm birth (34). Participants with missing data were excluded from the 
regression models and are reported in Tables 1 and 2. 
To estimate the risk of preterm or SGA birth, we generated separate models for pregnancy 
planning and timing. In addition to the independent, binary exposures of planning and 
timing, we created a 4-level exposure variable: (1) women with an unplanned pregnancy 
occurring at a bad time, (2) women with an unplanned pregnancy occurring at a good time, 
(3) women with a planned pregnancy occurring at a bad time, and (4) women with a planned 
pregnancy occurring at a good time (reference category). Analyses were conducted using 
SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
The cohort is comprised of 2654 women with singleton, live births who completed the initial 
interview assessing exposures of pregnancy planning and timing status, after exclusion of 
women with multiple births, miscarriage, stillbirth, abortion, and withdrawals. Data on birth 
outcomes were available for 99%. Of these 2654 women, 2487 (94%) completed at least 1 
of the 2 remaining interviews (at 28 weeks EGA or 8 weeks postpartum), and 2008 women 
(83%) completed both (34). 
Our study population was primarily white (73.7%), educated (56.6% of women reported 16 
or more years of education), married or living with a partner (87%), and older (mean age 31, 
83.5% age 25 or older). Table 1 presents demographic and other characteristics for all 
participants, and compares those with term versus preterm pregnancies. 




Thirty-seven percent of participants reported unplanned pregnancies and 13% reported that 
it was not a good time to be pregnant (Table 1). Information on pregnancy planning was 
missing for 3 participants and information on pregnancy timing was missing for 23 
participants. Approximately 8.5% of participants experienced a preterm birth and 8.3% 
delivered a SGA infant. Information on birth weight was missing for 4 participants. 
Compared to women with planned or well-timed pregnancies, multivariate adjusted models 
did not support the hypothesis that women with unplanned pregnancies had a significantly 
higher probability of preterm (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.18, 95% CI 0.85-1.65) or SGA birth (OR 
1.17, 95% CI 0.69-1.97), or that women reporting a poorly timed pregnancy had a 
significantly higher probability of preterm (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53-1.38) or SGA birth (OR 
0.92, 95% CI 0.65-1.29) (Tables 1 and 2). Covariates that were significantly associated with 
an increased odds of preterm birth included: previous preterm birth (OR 4.43, 95% CI 
3.00-6.52) and panic disorder during pregnancy (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.08-3.71) (Table 1). 
Maternal age 25 to 34 years was associated with a lower risk of preterm birth (OR 0.62, 95% 
CI 0.44-0.86) (Table 1) compared to age 35 and greater. For SGA, less than 12 years of 
education (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.01-3.35) and cigarette use (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.19-2.65) was 
associated with higher risk, while history of 1 or more previous births (OR 0.69, 95% CI 
0.50-0.95) was associated with a lower risk of SGA (Table 2). Neither pregnancy planning 
nor timing, modelled as a 4-level exposure variable, in logistic regression and adjusted for 
the above covariates showed a significant association with preterm birth or SGA (Table 3 
and 4). 

In this prospective cohort study, we found no significant association between pregnancy 
planning and pregnancy timing and the risk of preterm or SGA birth. A major strength of 
these findings includes analysis of data from a large, carefully characterized cohort of 
women who were prospectively assessed during early pregnancy for planning and timing. 
Outcome data were collected from medical record abstraction, rather than self-report, and 
the analysis was robust in its adjustment for multiple confounding factors. 
Previous studies demonstrating a significant increase in preterm (10-15,16,17) or SGA births 
(3,10,11,13,14,17-22) among unplanned pregnancies have multiple methodological 
limitations. Most studies showing a positive association relied on retrospective assessment 
of pregnancy intention,(3,10-15,17-22) which may be subject to recall and reporting bias 
(2,52). Prospective longitudinal analyses of pregnancy planning and timing demonstrate that 
women’s answers change over time, especially after childbirth and women are more likely 
to report a pregnancy as planned, possibly due to rationalization (2,52). Women giving birth 
to infants with health problems due to prematurity or SGA may also be more likely to report 
a pregnancy as unplanned (53). In addition to limitations in exposure assessment, many 
studies employed methods to ascertain birth outcomes that are less reliable than review of 
individual medical charts, including retrospective parental surveys and use of birth 
certificate data (10,12-15, 17, 19, 20, 22). Studies reporting an increased risk of preterm or 
SGA births among women with unplanned pregnancies are also hampered by lack of control 
for potential confounding variables (11,15,18). In our analyses among women with 



unplanned pregnancy, we also found a significant unadjusted odds for preterm birth 
(OR1.39, 95% CI 1.05-1.83) which was attenuated and non-significant after adjustment for 
confounders. Studies that do not control for confounding factors, such as socioeconomic 
status and race, may falsely associate pregnancy planning and timing with preterm and SGA 
birth. 
There are only 4 studies in the published literature reporting antenatal assessment of 
pregnancy planning and timing, with abstracted preterm and SGA birth outcome data from 
medical records (16,23,25,26), and only 1 study meeting the same criteria that reports SGA 
outcomes (25). Three prospective studies did not find a significant association between 
pregnancy planning and timing, and preterm and/or SGA birth (23,25,26) and one study 
showed a significant association between pregnancy planning and timing and preterm birth 
(SGA not evaluated) (16). However, none of the 4 prospective studies comprehensively 
adjusted for potential confounding (16,23,25,26), including lack of adjustment for history of 
prior preterm birth (23,26), which is the strongest risk factor for preterm birth (28), and lack 
of adjustment for age (16), race (25,26), education (16,25,26), marital status (16,25), mental 
health disorders (16,25,26) or use of tobacco (23,26), alcohol (23, 26), or illicit substances 
(23,25,26). 

To the best of our knowledge, this analysis of the relationship between pregnancy planning 
and timing with preterm birth and SGA is the largest prospective cohort of pregnant women 
with individual assessments reported. As noted, previous analyses have evaluated pregnancy 
intention retrospectively (e.g. up to 5 years postpartum) (15). Our study also evaluated 
comprehensive information on multiple potential confounders, including maternal 
demographics, medical conditions, and other risk factors, which improves upon previous 
analyses that did not adjust for possible confounders (11,15,18,16,23,25,26). Another 
strength of our dataset is that it used two standard measures of pregnancy planning (one 
direct question about whether the pregnancy was planned and a second question about 
whether the timing of pregnancy was good) that were asked during the first interview, before 
18 weeks EGA, prior to birth outcomes. Finally, our study reviewed medical records of all 
participants to capture robust outcome measurements for gestational age and birth weight at 
delivery, instead of using administrative data (birth certificates) or retrospective survey 
responses from parents (10,12-15, 17, 19, 20, 22). 
This dataset is limited by its assessment of pregnancy planning and timing by the 2 measures 
used. While these 2 assessments are standard measures, they have been criticized as being 
imprecise. For example, many find fault with the assumption that pregnancy is a conscious 
and deliberate decision for women (2,52-56) and point out that a dichotomous response 
option does not account for the approximately 30-60% of women who may be ambivalent 
about pregnancy planning (52,57). Therefore, this analysis may have been enriched by more 
in-depth questions, such as whether pregnancy was unplanned but desired or unplanned and 
undesired, and by including questions about prenatal preparation and whether pregnancy 
was discussed with and agreed upon by the male partner (55,58). Analysis of pregnancy 
desirability would also benefit from multiple longitudinal assessments, with questions 



repeated at each study visit. To further address issues of reverse causality, it would have 
been helpful to assess perceived stress and social support before pregnancy and throughout 
pregnancy, since they may be acting as mediators for the relationship between unplanned 
pregnancy and preterm birth. 
Generalizability of our findings may be limited by the characteristics of study participants. 
Compared to national statistics, participants in this cohort exhibited a similar rate of 
unplanned pregnancy (40% vs. 37%), but a lower rate of preterm birth (11.6% vs. 8.5%), 
respectively. Compared to regional statistics from the same time period (2005-2009), 
participants in this cohort exhibited a lower rate of preterm birth (on average 10.4% in 
Connecticut and 11.1% in Massachusetts vs. 8.5%), respectively (32). Our cohort was also 
predominantly 25-34 years old, white and non-Hispanic, highly educated, married or living 
with a partner, and therefore our findings may not be applicable to other populations of 
pregnant women. Furthermore, potential participants who chose to terminate their pregnancy 
were excluded from this study as the main outcome was preterm birth. Since women with 
unplanned, undesired pregnancies are more likely to choose abortion, it is not surprising that 
our cohort would have a relatively high population of planned pregnancies, occurring at a 
good time in women’s lives. 
Among our cohort, having an unplanned or poorly timed pregnancy was not associated with 
preterm or SGA birth. However, future research examining whether pregnancy planning and 
timing is associated with preterm or SGA birth in specific sub-groups of high-risk women is 
warranted, utilizing prospective assessments of pregnancy planning and timing, medical 
record abstraction to optimize validity of clinical outcome measures, and collection of 
salient information on potential confounding variables. If pregnancy planning and/or timing 
is associated with preterm or SGA birth in some groups of high-risk women, targeted 
screening and interventions could improve maternal and neonatal health.
