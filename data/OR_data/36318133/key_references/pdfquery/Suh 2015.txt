Abstract Background Postpartum depression is associ- 
ated with negative physical and mental health outcomes for 
both the mother and infant. This study examines the rela- 
tionship between a mother and/or her partner’s pregnancy 
intentions and reported post-partum depressive symptoms 
(PPDs). Methods Using Louisiana pregnancy risk assess- 
ment monitoring system, 2000–2003, a secondary cross- 
sectional analysis was conducted on 5549 mothers, strati- 
ﬁed by race, who delivered a singleton, live birth and 
whose infant was still alive at the time of the survey. 
Bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were con- 
ducted, taking into account the complex survey design. 
Results In multivariable models, unwanted pregnancies 
were associated with severe PPDs (aOR 1.76, 95 % CI 
1.23–2.53). Furthermore, 
the association between hus- 
bands/partners’ who did not want or care about the preg- 
nancy and mild PPDs remained for White women (aOR 
1.32, 95 % CI 1.02–1.69); while among Black women, 
neither parent’s pregnancy intention were associated with

mild or severe PPDs. Conclusions This study supports 
existing research demonstrating the association between 
pregnancy intention and PPDs. This study contributes to 
the limited information on the role that partner pregnancy 
intention plays on maternal mental health outcomes, 
however further discussion is needed on the impact of this 
role across races. Findings can be used in programs aiming 
to reduce adverse mental health outcomes among high-risk 
mothers.

Maternal mental health 

Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are 
unintended—either mistimed or unwanted. Though a lim- 
ited number of studies have found that women with 
unwanted or mistimed pregnancies were at higher risk of 
reporting PPD, they have not consistently taken into con- 
sideration partner support, particularly father’s own preg- 
nancy wantedness or intention. Furthermore, no studies to 
date that have examined the impact of partner support 
within racial groups. 
The objective of this study was to better understand the 
relationship between pregnancy intentions of both the 
mother and the father and maternal postpartum depressive 
affect, utilizing data from the state-wide Louisiana Preg- 
nancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (LaPRAMS) 
Phase IV (2000–2003) data. This study contributes to the 
limited information on the role that partner pregnancy 
intention plays on postpartum depressive affect and pre- 
sents novel ﬁndings by race that may aid in prevention 
strategies. 



Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unin- 
tended—either mistimed or unwanted [1–3]. The term mistimed 
pregnancy is most commonly used when a women becomes 
pregnant earlier than preferred and an unwanted pregnancy 
when there wasn’t a desire for children at all, or more children 
[3]. In fact, almost 40 % of women in the U.S. in their lifetime 
have had an unintended pregnancy that led to an early termi- 
nation [1], and 37 % of women have delivered a baby that 
resulted from an unintended pregnancy [4]. In Louisiana alone, 
58 % of all pregnancies are unintended—72 % of those are 
mistimed, and 28 % are unwanted [5]. Younger (aged 18–24), 
low-income, minority 
unmarried (particularly cohabiting), 
women and women who have not completed high school are 
more likely to have an unintended pregnancy [6]. 
Unintended pregnancies are associated with adverse 
health outcomes for the mother and child, such as maternal 
tobacco and alcohol use during pregnancy [7, 8], low birth 
weight or preterm birth [8, 9], lower prenatal care utiliza- 
tion, reduced breast feeding rates [5, 8, 10, 11], lower folic 
acid consumption or decreased use of prenatal care services 
[12–15]. While the relationship between pregnancy inten- 
tion and infant health outcomes has been well documented, 
few studies address the impact of unintended pregnancies 
on maternal physical and mental health, such as postpartum 
depression (PPD) [16–24]. 
Nearly 20 % of mothers experience a depressive episode 
within the ﬁrst 3 months postpartum, and 7.1 % have major 
depressive symptomology [25]. Symptoms of PPD are 
depressed mood, sleep disturbance, weight changes, loss of 
energy, decreased concentration, increased sensitivity and 
anxiety [26]. PPD has been associated with a decrease in 
the time a mother spends with her infant [27], missed 
pediatric appointments [28], higher levels of disruptive 
behavior among children [29], and insecure attachment 
between mother and child [30]. Although there is no clear 
cause of PPD, risk factors include family history of psy- 
chiatric disease, marital distress, inadequate social support, 
intimate partner violence, racial or ethnic minority status, 
and high levels of psychosocial 
[26, 31–33]. 
Reported symptoms of PPD have been lower among White 
women in some samples [34, 34], and higher in others [35], 
although once additional factors such as ﬁnancial hardship 
and pregnancy intention are taken into account, racial and 
ethnic differences in PPD may no longer be apparent [35– 
37]. Though a limited number of studies have found that 
women with unwanted or mistimed pregnancies were at 
higher risk of reporting PPD, they have not consistently 
taken into consideration partner support [15, 17, 18, 38, 
39], and we identiﬁed no studies to date that have exam- 
ined the impact of partner support within racial groups. 



Marital status or lack of a partner has been linked with an 
increased risk of PPD [31, 35], and the connection between 
relationship quality and or satisfaction and depression has 
been well documented [40]. One potential mechanism in the 
relation between marital status or lack of a partner and risk of 
PPD is the effect of partner support on the mother’s per- 
ceived social support, which may be linked to PPD [35, 36]. 
While paternal support can be deﬁned through multiple 
measures: ﬁnancial support, assistance with child-rearing, 
the presence of the father on the baby’s birth certiﬁcate [41– 
47], father’s own pregnancy wantedness or intention is 
another aspect of social support related to maternal mental 
health that has received much less attention in the literature. 
While few studies have examined the increase in risk of PPD 
as a result of partner pregnancy intention [16], research on 
partners’ pregnancy intentions and relationship quality has 
demonstrated the important role that relationship quality and 
partner intentions play in prenatal care [48], smoking during 
pregnancy [49], and subsequent high-risk pregnancies [50]. 
Others have linked partners’ pregnancy intentions and 
relationship satisfaction to depression, although the risk of 
PPD was not addressed explicitly [51, 52]. 
The objective of this study was to better understand the 
relationship between pregnancy intentions of both the 
mother and the father and maternal postpartum depressive 
affect. We hypothesized that compared to mothers who 
wanted their pregnancies, those who mistimed or did not 
want to conceive, would have higher rates of reported 
postpartum depressive affect, with stronger associations in 
unwanted pregnancies than mistimed pregnancies. We also 
hypothesized that mothers whose partners viewed the 
pregnancy as mistimed or unwanted would have higher 
rates of reported postpartum depressive affect than mothers 
whose partners wanted the pregnancy. 



A secondary cross-sectional study utilizing Louisiana’s 
System 
Pregnancy 
(LaPRAMS) Phase IV (2000–2003) data was conducted. 
Phase IV LaPRAMS data was used because it is more rep- 
resentative of the general Louisiana population since Phases 
V and VI had low response rates due to the disruption and 
displacement of residents caused by Hurricane Katrina. The 
average response rate for 2000–2003 was 71 %. 
PRAMS is an ongoing, population-based risk factor 
surveillance system designed to detect maternal experi- 
ences and health behaviors that occur before, during and 
after pregnancy [53]. Stratiﬁed random sampling of 


mothers is used to oversample older (35? years old) 
mothers, women who deliver low birth weight (\2500 g) 
infants and racial minorities. PRAMS questions cover 
topics such as prenatal care, obstetric history, maternal use 
of alcohol and cigarettes, physical abuse, contraception, 
economic status, maternal stress, and early infant devel- 
opment and health status [54]. PRAMS utilizes both 
qualitative and quantitative data in a self-reported ques- 
tionnaire that is completed a few months after the baby is 
born. An introduction letter is sent to introduce PRAMS to 
the mother and within a week, the mother receives the 
survey in the mail. Mothers who do not complete the ﬁrst 
survey are mailed a second; if they do not complete the 
second survey, they are mailed a third. Mothers who do not 
complete any of the three mail surveys are contacted by 
telephone, for a total data collection period of 95 days. To 
minimize recall bias, efforts to contact women end 
9 months postpartum [54]. 
Approximately 100–300 women are selected per month 
from a stratiﬁed sample of eligible birth certiﬁcates [54]. 
Consistent with previous and ongoing PRAMS procedure, 
all participating health departments use a standardized data 
collection method developed by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. In this study, three levels of inclu- 
sion criteria were applied. First analysis was limited to 
mothers who delivered singleton live births and whose child 
was still living at the time the survey was administered 
(N = 6582). Next, only White and Black mothers were 
included in the analysis due to very small sample size of 
other racial groups in the dataset (\2 %). Last, analysis was 
limited to women who had completed information on all of 
analytic variables including outcomes, key exposure vari- 
ables, demographic and other predictors (described below). 
List-wise deletion was chosen because there were \10 % 
missing data and no differences between missing and non- 
missing so missing at random was assumed. For perceived 
husband/partner pregnancy intention, \5 % of the mothers 
were missing data and therefore were not included in this 
analysis. After inclusion criterion was applied the ﬁnal 
analytic sample included 5549 women. There were no dif- 
ferences between the full and analytic samples with respect 
to demographics or other potential confounders. 


Mother’s pregnancy intention from LaPRAMS was mea- 
sured by a question addressing how they felt about 
becoming pregnant, ‘‘Thinking back to just before you got 
pregnant, how did you feel about becoming pregnant?’’ 
The answer scales included (1) ‘‘Wanted to be pregnant 
sooner’’; (2) ‘‘Wanted to be pregnant later’’; (3) ‘‘Wanted 
to be pregnant then’’; (4) ‘‘Did not want to be pregnant then 
or in the future.’’ Consistent with previous studies [7, 55], 
we collapsed this variable into three levels: wanted (op- 
tions 1 and 3), mistimed (option 2) and unwanted preg- 
nancy (option 4). The mother’s perception of her husband 
or partner’s pregnancy intention was measured by the 
question ‘‘Which statement describes your husband or 
partner before pregnancy?’’ (1) ‘‘Wanted me to get preg- 
nant’’, (2) ‘‘Partly wanted to get pregnant’’, (3) ‘‘He didn’t 
care one way or the other’’, (4) ‘‘Did not especially want 
me to get pregnant’’, (4) ‘‘Wanted very much for me not to 
get pregnant.’’ Options 1 and 2 were classiﬁed as a wanted 
pregnancy, option 3 as indifferent, and options 4 and 5 as 
unwanted. We also examine partner discordance, deﬁned 
as: the mother wanting the pregnancy but the partner not 
wanting the pregnancy; the mother not wanting the preg- 
nancy but the partner wanting the pregnancy; any discor- 
dance between mother and partner (yes/no). 


Five options derived from LaPRAMs responses to the 
question ‘‘In the months after your delivery, would you say 
that you were…’’ were used as indicators to measure self- 
reported 
(PPDs). 
Respondents’ answers were classiﬁed into three categories: 
‘‘Not depressed at all’’ was deemed as absence of depres- 
sive affect, ‘‘Little depressed’’ and ‘‘Moderately depres- 
sed’’ as mild depression; and ‘‘Very depressed’’ or ‘‘Very 
depressed and need help’’ as severe depression. 


All of sociodemographic variables were obtained from 
LaPRAMs IV and birth certiﬁcate records in Louisiana. 
Maternal age and biological fathers’ age (from birth cer- 
tiﬁcate) were re-coded as younger than 18, 18–24, 25–34, 
older than 35 years old. Maternal education from the birth 
certiﬁcate was categorized as \12, 12 and [12 years. The 
household income (from PRAMS) was categorized as 
$0–14,999, $15,000–24,999, $25,000–34,999, higher than 
$35,000. Marital status (from birth certiﬁcate) was classiﬁed 
as married and not married. Additional variables were 
dichotomized as yes or no including: insurance (‘‘Insurance 
status before delivery’’ and ‘‘Medicaid during pregnancy’’) 
from PRAMS, birth outcomes from the birth certiﬁcate 
(‘‘previous live birth’’ and ‘‘Very low birth weight baby’’ i.e. 
babies born weighing \1500 g), and three health behavior 
indicators from PRAMS (‘‘smoking at last 3 months during 
pregnancy’’, ‘‘drinking at the last 3 months of pregnancy’’ 
and current smoking status. As a marker of stress, if partic- 
ipants gave any conﬁrmative answer to 13 stress questions 
on the PRAMS survey (e.g., homeless, lost job, ﬁnancial 



problems, and physical ﬁght) they were characterized as 
having experienced at least one stressor 12 months before 
pregnancy. Factor weights were applied to individual stres- 
sors, however this did not result in a statistic difference 
analytically, and treating stress as un-weighted by type of 
stressor is commonly utilized in cumulative risk markers 
[56, 57]. Physical abuse from PRAMS was measured by 
asking whether new mothers had any physical abuse from 
husband or others 12 months before or during their preg- 
nancy, and their responses were dichotomized as yes and no. 
These covariates were chose based on previous documen- 
tation in the literature of their association with pregnancy 
intention and birth outcomes as well as examination of 
potential confounding as described below. 

Descriptive analysis was performed to characterize the 
respondents. To obtain the pairwise comparison, a general- 
ized multinominal logistic regression model was used to 
evaluate the associations between outcome variable (PPDs) 
and exposure variables (Parents’ pregnancy intention) con- 
trolling for demographic and other covariate variables. 
Bivariate analyses and Chi square test were performed to 
estimate the crude association between maternal pregnancy 
intention and husband/partners’ intention and PPDs sepa- 
rately and crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % conﬁdence 
intervals (CIs) were calculated. Covariates that were signif- 
icantly associated with PPDs at p \ 0.05 in bivariate analy- 
ses and that changed the estimation of the ORs for intention 
by more than 10 %, or commonly considered confounders in 
the literature were included in a multinominal 
logistic 
regression model to examine the association between expo- 
sure and mild PPDs and severe PPDs respectively. Mother 
and husband/partner’s pregnancy intention were included in 
the same model, however models with separate intention 
variables as well as discordance were run separately. Due to 
long-standing racial disparities (White vs. Black) in birth 
outcomes [58], racial disparities in unintended pregnancies 
[6], and conﬂicting evidence regarding PPD differences 
across race among women, we tested effect modiﬁcation by 
race and data analysis was stratiﬁed by race to examine 
whether there were racial differences in the association 
between parents’ pregnancy intention and PPDs. To account 
for the complex sampling design of PRAMS, all statistical 
analyses were weighted and performed using SAS 9.2. 

Weighted frequencies of demographic characteristics, 
parents’ pregnancy intention and PPDs of all participants 
are presented in Table 1. Of 5549 respondents, 60.7 % 

were White and 39.3 % were Black mothers. For preg- 
nancy intention among respondents, 47.3 % mothers 
reported that they wanted to have a baby at that time, 36 % 
that 
the 
the pregnancy was mistimed and 16.7 % that 
pregnancy was unwanted. Nearly half of 
respondents 
reported their husbands/partners’ wanted them to become 
pregnant, 19 % didn’t care and 24 % did not want their 
wives/partners’ to become pregnant. With respect to dis- 
cordance, 14 % of mothers experienced some form of 
partner discordance, with approximately 9 % of mothers 
wanting the pregnancy but the partner did not and 5 % of 
mothers not wanting the pregnancy but the partner did. 
Nearly 60 % of women reported they experienced any type 
of PPDs (9.2 % severe PPDs and 48.2 mild PPDs). 
White mothers were more likely to report that their 
pregnancy was intended compared to Black mothers. While 
26 % of Black mothers reported their pregnancy was 
unintended a much lower percentage of White participants 
reported unintended pregnancies (11 %). Responses were 
similar for Black and White women related to their hus- 
bands/partner’s pregnancy intention; more than 50 % of 
husbands/partners wanted a baby and \30 % did not. 
Overall, White mothers reported higher percentages of 
mild PPDs than Black mothers (52 % vs. 42 %), and Black 
mothers were more likely to report no PPDs and severe 
PPDs compared to White mothers. 
Crude bivariate analysis, presented in Table 2, in the 
overall sample revealed that respondents whose pregnan- 
cies were mistimed were 15 % more likely to have mild 
(OR 1.15, 95 % CI 1.01–1.33) and 50 % more likely to 
have severe PPDs (OR 1.52, 95 % CI 1.19–1.95) compared 
to mothers who wanted to become pregnant. The associa- 
tion was even stronger between unwanted pregnancies and 
to 
reporting severe PPDs; mothers who did not want 
become pregnant were twice as likely to report severe 
PPDs compared to mothers who wanted to become preg- 
nant (OR 2.12, 95 % CI 1.58–2.84). Maternal report of 
partners’ pregnancy intention was also associated with 
mothers’ PPDs. Respondents were 1.25 times more likely 
to report mild (OR 1.25, 95 % CI 1.07–1.47) and 1.46 
times more likely to report severe PPDs (severe PPDs OR 
1.46, 95 % CI 1.12–1.89) if they perceived that their hus- 
bands/partners did not want the pregnancy.;). With respect 
to discordance, mothers who wanted the pregnancy but the 
partner did not were signiﬁcantly less likely to report 
severe PPDs (OR 0.64, 95 % CI 0.44–0.93); while those 
who did not want the pregnancy but the partner did were 
signiﬁcantly more likely to report severe PPDs (OR 1.57, 
95 % CI 1.04–2.37). As expected given these results, there 
was no relation between any discordance and PPDs. 
In the overall sample, crude associations were statisti- 
cally signiﬁcant for the following covariates—maternal 
education ([12 years of education), household income

a Any physical abuse means suffering any physical abuse from husband or others before or during delivery 
report mild PPDs compared to mothers who perceived that 
their partner wanted the pregnancy. However among black 
women maternal pregnancy unwantedness was only sig- 
niﬁcantly associated with severe PPDs, with black mothers 
who did not want to become pregnant being 1.7 times more 
likely to report severe PPDs (OR 1.70, 95 % CI 1.08–2.67) 
compared to black mothers who wanted to become preg- 
nant. No association between husbands/partners’ intention 
and mothers’ PPDs was found; however, Black mothers 
who indicated not wanting the pregnancy but the partner 
did were signiﬁcantly more likely to report severe PPDs 
(OR 1.63, 95 % CI 1.00–2.67) For the covariates in the 
sample of White women, crudely, associations were sta- 
tistically signiﬁcant for biological father’s age, maternal 
education, marital status and having insurance before 
pregnancy. Among Black women, only maternal education, 
physical abuse, and smoking were signiﬁcant. 
Table 3 presents the results from multivariable analysis 
among the overall, White and Black samples. After 
adjusting for covariates, mothers who had mistimed preg- 
nancies were 20 % more likely to report mild PPDs (aOR 
1.19, 95 % CI 1.01–1.41) and mothers who had an 
unwanted pregnancies were 1.76 times more likely to 
report severe PPDs compared to respondents who intended 
to get pregnant (aOR 1.76, 95 % CI 1.23–2.53), with the 
strength of this association slightly lower compared to the 
crude association from the bivariate analysis. Hus- 
bands/partners’ wanting a baby was no longer signiﬁcantly 
associated with most types of PPDs but those participants 
whose husbands/partners did not care if their partner 
became pregnant were less likely to report severe PPDs 
(aOR 0.70, 95 % CI 0.51–0.97) and those whose partner 
did not want the pregnancy were more likely to report mild 
(aOR 1.32, 95 % CI 1.02–1.69), even after 
PPDs 
accounting for any discordance. Models with discordance 
in either direction (mother wanted pregnancy but father did 
not, or vice versa) also revealed no signiﬁcant association 
with PPDs after accounting for other covariates. The ﬁnal 
model presents results with any discordance due to larger 
cell sizes for stratiﬁed analyses. Black respondents were 
signiﬁcantly less likely to have mild PPDs compared with 
their White counterparts (aOR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.61–0.86). 
Consistent with bivariate analysis results, having a very 
low birth weight baby, suffering any abuse before or during 
delivery, experiencing any life stress before delivery, and 
being a current smoker when interviewed were strongly 
associated with self-reported PPDs, with stronger associa- 
tions observed for severe versus mild PPDs in multivari- 
able multinomial models (Table 3). 
Among White participants, women with unwanted 
pregnancies were 1.79 times more likely to have severe 
PPDs compared with respondents with intended pregnan- 
cies after adjusting for covariates (aOR 1.79, 95 % CI 
1.07–2.99), but there was no signiﬁcant difference com- 
pared with women with mistimed pregnancies. White 
the 
women with husbands/partners’ who did not want 



pregnancy were 30 % more likely to report mild PPDs 
compared to those whose husbands/partners wanted them 
to become pregnant (aOR 1.32, 95 % CI 1.02–1.69). 
Among Black women, after controlling for all of the 
covariates, neither mother or partner’s pregnancy intention 
was associated with mild or severe PPDs. Consistent with 
overall sample, experiencing any stress 12 months before 
pregnancy, being a victim of any abuse and having a very 
low birth weight baby were strongly associated with mild 
and severe PPDs among both Black and White mothers. 

The goal of this research was to better understand the 
relationship between pregnancy intentions of both the 
mother and the father and maternal mental health out- 
comes. We observed that, compared to mothers who 
wanted their pregnancies, those who mistimed or did not 
want to conceive, were more likely to report postpartum 
depressive affect, with greater associations in unwanted 
pregnancies than mistimed pregnancies and for severe 
PPDs affect versus mild. The association with not wanting 
the pregnancy and severe PPDs was observed overall and 
among White but not Black women. Discordance in 
intention also played a role in PPDs, although only in crude 
analyses. Women who indicated they did not want the 
pregnancy but 
the partner did were signiﬁcantly more 
likely to report severe PPDs; yet, unexpectedly, those who 
indicated they wanted the pregnancy but the partner did not 
were less likely to have mild PPDs. 
We also observed signiﬁcant differences in PPDs 
between Black and White women, with Black women half 
as likely to experience mild PPDs compared to White 
women, although there was no signiﬁcant difference in 
severe PPDs between racial groups. Results corroborate 
previous studies that have observed differences in rates of 
postpartum depression across racial and economic groups 
[]. However, such differences may also be related to 
socioeconomic status or diagnostic biases [59, 60]. 
Results corroborate ﬁndings that women with unwanted 
or mistimed pregnancies may be at higher risk of reporting 
PPD than women with intended pregnancies [15, 17, 18, 
38, 39]. The ﬁndings from this study provide an additional 
perspective on the relationship between unintended preg- 
nancies and PPD; that there may be a difference in PPDs 
severity if the pregnancy was mistimed or unwanted. It 
seems appropriate that women who reported their preg- 
nancies as mistimed, they wanted children but not at that 
time, were more likely to report mild PPDs. Whereas 
women who did not want to get pregnant at all or did not 
want any more children, an unwanted pregnancy, were 
more likely to report severe PPDs. 

It is not entirely clear whether pregnancy intention itself 
is a risk factor for PPDs, or if other variables such as 
pregnancy outcome, partner support or additional stressors 
during pregnancy play a role in the association. An 
unwanted or mistimed pregnancy may be indicative of 
marital distress, inadequate social support, or potentially 
intimate partner violence—all of which have been associ- 
ated with PPD [26, 31–33, 61]. Others studies utilizing 
PRAMS data have noted that some risk factors for post- 
partum depression are partner-associated stress and physi- 
cal abuse during pregnancy [55]. We also observed that 
physical abuse during pregnancy was one of the strongest 
factors in PPDs in this sample, with both Black and White 
women being more than three times more likely to expe- 
rience severe PPDs if they reported any physical abuse than 
those women who reported no abuse during pregnancy. 
They were approximately two times as likely to experience 
mild PPDs compared to women reporting no abuse. 
Physical abuse in the adjusted model also attenuated the 
impact of partner’s intention, rendering it non-signiﬁcant 
for most associations and potentially indicative of media- 
tion by physical abuse in the partner support-PPDs relation. 
While full mediation was not tested in this analysis, this is 
an area for future study. 
Although mother’s intention to get pregnant is the most 
commonly used indicator of pregnancy intention in the 
literature, father and/or partner’s intent should be consid- 
ered and results indicate that this relation may differ by 
race. We also observed that mothers with partners who did 
not care about or want the pregnancy had higher rates of 
reported postpartum depressive affect than mothers whose 
partners wanted the pregnancy among White but not Black 
women. In adjusted models as well, lack of partner support 
was associated with mild PPDs but only among White 
women. Having a partner who did not care was protective 
against severe PPDs in the sample overall. Research has 
shown that partner support during the course of a woman’s 
pregnancy is essential to the mother’s health and well-be- 
ing [13, 41, 44, 62–64]. While we did examine discordance 
between the mother and her partner for pregnancy want- 
edness, the questions posed to mothers about her own 
pregnancy wantedness and her partners’ were not the same; 
therefore, actual discordance was difﬁcult to deﬁne and 
with similar questions, may have revealed a greater impact. 
Findings from this study are also congruent with pre- 
vious studies reporting that Louisiana’s unintended preg- 
nancy rates, while comparable to the national average, may 
be higher than other states’ averages by at least 10 % [11]. 
This coupled with research demonstrating that women with 
unintended pregnancies are more likely to report PPD 
symptomology than women with intended pregnancies 
emphasizes the importance for clinicians and public health 
professionals to understand this complex relationship 


between pregnancy intention and postpartum depressive 
affect [7]. 
Despite important ﬁndings, there are key limitations, 
including the fact that this study was retrospective assess- 
ment of pregnancy intention, which introduces the possi- 
bility of recall bias and temporal limitations. The most 
accurate measures of pregnancy intention are prospective 
and are multi-faceted [19, 65–67], and ideally based on 
data from both the mother and father. Women with low 
birth weight or preterm infants, may be more likely to 
indicate lower levels of pregnancy intention than women 
with healthy, full-term babies [68]. Also, women may 
misstate pregnancy intention in either direction, resulting 
in an unreliable measure [10]. An additional limitation is 
the response choices in mother’s and father’s pregnancy 
intention, which were different and therefore made simul- 
taneous examination difﬁculty. Furthermore, partner’s 
pregnancy intention was based on mother’s proxy reports 
of fathers’ intentions rather than fathers’ own reports. 
Furthermore, there is no information on the speciﬁcs of the 
romantic status of the mothers’ relationship (i.e., together 
the time of the survey or single vs. 
or separated at 
cohabitating) which may have an impact on the importance 
of partner intention. The self-reported of PPDs is also 
retrospective, covers a broad period of time, and is a sub- 
jective measure of depression based on one survey question 
that is not a derivative of commonly used items. There are 
limitations in trying to capture pregnancy intention and 
post-partum depressive affect in a single question. Mater- 
nal mental health is a complex issue that cannot be diag- 
nosed or even fully captured in a single question, as was 
done in this PRAMS dataset. Finally, a cross-sectional 
study design does not allow for causal inferences and there 
is the possibility for reciprocal associations between ret- 
rospective pregnancy intention, perception of partners’ 
pregnancy intention, and self-reported PPDs. 
Findings from this research can be used to aid in the 
development and assessment of programs designed to 
identify high-risk mothers and reduce adverse mental 
health outcomes for mothers [54]. Programs should take 
pregnancy intention into consideration when attempting to 
identify mothers at an increased risk for PPD, in addition to 
other factors such as current and previous stressful life 
events, especially physical abuse, but also the cumulative 
risk that many women with untended pregnancies may face 
[50]. States like Georgia, Oklahoma and Washington have 
already used PRAMS data to direct policy and program 
initiatives directed at unintended pregnancy. As Louisiana 
has a higher level of unintended pregnancies compared to 
most states [11], and a relatively high prevalence of 
mothers who report PPDs, there is an increased impetus to 
utilize evidenced based ﬁndings to inform programs and 
practice. Clinicians and healthcare providers should also be 
aware of the intention of the mother and of her partner in 
preparing for the postnatal period. While policy and pro- 
gram initiatives to address unintended pregnancies may be 
beneﬁcial, results from this study stress the importance of 
considering racial differences in both pregnancy intention 
and PPDs report in order to most effectively address neg- 
ative mental health outcomes. The inﬂuence of unintended 
pregnancies is complex and this study contributes to the 
limited information on the role that partner pregnancy 
intention plays on maternal mental health outcomes [16].
