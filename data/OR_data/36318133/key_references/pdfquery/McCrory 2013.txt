Background: Unintended pregnancy is associated with increased risk for adverse neonatal and early childhood 
outcomes spanning an array of indicators, but it remains unclear whether these risks hold independent of other 
biological, social and environmental risk factors. 
Methods: This study uses data from the ﬁrst wave of the ‘Growing Up in Ireland Study’, a large nationally repre- 
sentative cohort study of more than 11 000 infants, to examine the risk factors associated with unintended preg- 
nancy. Adopting a staged approach to the analysis, the study investigates whether pregnancy intention inﬂuences 
maternal health behaviours during pregnancy independent of background characteristics, and whether pregnancy 
intention carries any additional risk for adverse infant and maternal health outcomes when we adjust for back- 
ground characteristics and prenatal behaviours. 
Results: The study conﬁrmed that sociodemographic factors are strongly associated with unintended pregnancy 
and that unintended pregnancy is associated with a range of health compromising behaviours that are known to 
be harmful to the developing fetus. While there was little evidence to suggest that pregnancy intention was 
associated with adverse neonatal outcomes or developmental delay independent of other covariates, there was 
strong evidence that intention status had a bearing on the mother’s psychosocial health. Unintended pregnancy 
was associated with increased risk of depression (risk ratio 1.36 [95% conﬁdence interval 1.19, 1.54]), and higher 
parenting stress (risk ratio 1.27 [95% conﬁdence interval 1.16, 1.38]). 
Conclusions: Ascertaining the mother’s pregnancy intention during the ﬁrst antenatal visit may represent a means 
for monitoring those at greatest risk for adverse mother and child outcomes. 

Although studies differ in their characterisation of 
pregnancy intention,1 unintended pregnancy (UIP) is 
usually deﬁned as a pregnancy that is mistimed (i.e. 
occurs earlier or later than was intended) or is 
unwanted.2 UIPs are important from a public policy 
perspective 
associated with 
they 
increased risk for adverse neonatal outcomes, includ- 
ing preterm birth (PTB)3 and low birthweight (LBW).4

Other studies have documented deﬁcits extending 
into early childhood,5 and adulthood,6 although at 
present it is unclear whether these effects hold inde- 
pendent of other biological, social and environmental 
risk factors.1 
Less well understood are the reasons why UIP 
leads to worse outcomes.7 UIP may serve as a marker 
for other social disadvantages, which operate as inde- 
pendent risk factors for worse outcomes.7 UIP may 
also inﬂuence maternal health behaviours during the 
prenatal period and these decisions can have impor- 
tant implications for fetal growth and development. 
Alternatively, it could be that women with a UIP may 



experience less prenatal care, or delay seeking prenatal 
care.8 Finally, and less explored, are the psychosocial 
pathways through which UIP leads to adverse out- 
comes. For example, studies have documented poorer 
levels of psychological health among women with 
including higher rates of depression, higher 
UIPs, 
levels of perceived stress, and lower levels of partner 
and social support.9 
Pregnancy intention and pre-conceptional and 
prenatal behaviours 
A number of studies have examined the impact of UIP 
on maternal health behaviours during pregnancy, 
noting that those for whom the pregnancy was unin- 
tended are more likely to engage in health com- 
including smoking during 
promising behaviours, 
pregnancy,10–13 failing to adhere to recommendations 
regarding vitamin supplementation10,14,15 and delaying 
the timing of the ﬁrst antenatal booking appoint- 
ment.8,10,12,13 A recent study of maternal and neonatal 
consequences of UIP in rural India has also shown 
variations in the use of recommended prenatal care, 
with unwanted pregnancies over twice as likely as 
wanted pregnancies to receive inadequate prenatal 
care.16 Other studies, however, have found that UIP 
does not carry any excess risk of smoking during 
pregnancy when background factors have been con- 
trolled for.17,18 


Most studies investigating this issue have focused on 
the immediate neonatal period but it has been argued 
that methodologically rigorous studies examining the 
relationship between pregnancy intention and neo- 
natal outcomes are lacking.19 The evidence from the 
stronger 
that 
unwanted status does not carry any additional risk for 
adverse neonatal outcomes when maternal back- 
ground characteristics and differences in prenatal 
behaviours are controlled for.4,18 A systematic review4 
found that UIP was associated with signiﬁcantly 
increased odds of PTB and LBW in the unadjusted 
analysis, but that the relationship with PTB no longer 
held in the multivariable adjusted model. When the 
unintended category was further disaggregated into 
unwanted and mistimed pregnancies, there was no 
higher risk for LBW in the adjusted models. 




Pregnancy intention and mother and 
child outcomes 
Fewer studies have examined the impact of pregnancy 
intention on children’s outcomes beyond the immedi- 
ate neonatal period, and among those that have, ﬁnd- 
ings have been mixed. Analysis of data from the 
National Maternal and Infant Health Survey found 
that although unwanted pregnancy was associated 
with worse global health ratings, over-activity and 
lower scores on a composite developmental index, 
these effects were eroded when adjusted for maternal 
characteristics and social and biological risk factors.20 
A separate analysis of the same data set5 found that 
across each of the assessed outcomes (less than excel- 
lent health, over-activity and the composite develop- 
mental score), UIP was associated with less favourable 
outcomes. Finally, Carson and collaborators did not 
note any signiﬁcant differences in the cognitive scores 
of children resulting from unplanned vs. planned 
pregnancies at 3 or 5 years of age after adjusting for 
the marked socio-economic differences that existed 
between groups.21 
Pregnancy intention and parent 
psychosocial health 
While research on the impact of UIP on the mother’s 
mental health and psychosocial outcomes is limited,1 
there is evidence that UIP may modify the psychoso- 
cial health of mothers, by impacting on the levels of 
stress, anxiety and depression she may experience.9 
One study found that mothers with UIPs were more 
likely to report higher levels of depression and lower 
levels of happiness than mothers with planned preg- 
nancies, spent less leisure time with their children, 
and were more likely to use physical punishment 
with their children than other mothers.22 Even after 
controlling for sociodemographic variables, research 
indicates that UIP predicts poorer psychosocial out- 
comes for mothers.23,24 
Given the discrepant pattern of results that has 
emerged across studies, this study attempts to discern 
whether there are any signiﬁcant effects of pregnancy 
intention on a variety of maternal prenatal behaviours, 
infant outcomes, and parental psychosocial variables 
independent of background factors using data from 
the ﬁrst wave of the Growing Up in Ireland Study – a 
large nationally representative study of more than 
11 000 infants who were ﬁrst assessed at 9 months of 


age. The objectives of this was study were to (i) assess 
the relationship between pre-conceptional and post- 
partum behaviours;10 and (ii) explore infant outcomes 
in relation to UIP beyond the immediate perinatal 
period.21 


Children who would have been 9 months of age at the 
time of interview (between September 2008 and April 
2009) were selected from the Child Beneﬁt Register 
(CBR) provided by the Department of Social and 
Family Affairs. The CBR was used as a sampling frame 
because child beneﬁt is a universal welfare entitle- 
ment in Ireland and has practically complete coverage 
of all children born in the Republic of Ireland at the 
time of the study. The sample was selected on a sys- 
tematic basis, pre-stratifying by marital status, county 
of residence, nationality and number of children (i.e. 
less than 16 years of age) in the household to ensure 
that households less likely to respond were oversam- 
pled, using a random start and constant sampling 
fraction. The total eligible CBR population was all 
births occurring during the period December 2007 to 
June 2008, which amounted to 41 185 children. A total 
of 17 264 families were approached to take part in the 
study, of which 64.5% (n = 11 134) families consented 
to participate. 
The sample weights were constructed by adjusting 
the distribution of the sample to known population 
ﬁgures. The population distributions were derived 
from two sources. The ﬁrst source was from tabula- 
tions, which were prepared by the Central Statistics 
Ofﬁce on the number and characteristics of children 
(aged less than 1 year) and their families from the 
2006 Census of Population. The second source was the 
CBR from which the sample was drawn. The 73 662 
children registered on the CBR as being born in the 
calendar year 2008 were taken as the population to 
which the sample was statistically weighted and 
grossed in statistically re-adjusting the sample. 
The project was subject to ethical approval by a 
Research Ethics Committee convened by the Depart- 
ment of Health and Children. A letter of introduction 
was sent to the family a few days in advance of their 
ﬁrst contact. Interviewers were instructed to make 
initial visits to households in person. Interviewers 
administered the main questionnaires on laptops, and 
respondents completed a second, more sensitive ques- 
tionnaire on a Computer Assisted Self-Interview 
(CASI) basis. 

Information regarding pregnancy intention was 
obtained retrospectively when the child was 9 months 
of age by means of a survey question on the sensitive 
questionnaire administered on a CASI basis. This 
questionnaire was designed to capture other sensi- 
tive information relating to the respondent’s marital 
status and life style related behaviours during preg- 
nancy. Pregnancy intention was assessed by means of 
a question, which asked the mother whether she had 
intended to become pregnant before the study child 
was conceived. Responses were categorised into two 
categories: intended and unintended. The intended 
category included those who said that 
they had 
planned to become pregnant at that time (n = 6260). 
The unintended category included both unwanted 
[no intention of ever becoming pregnant (n = 1054)], 
unsure (n = 779) and mistimed pregnancies [either 
later (n = 1086), much later (n = 711) or earlier than 
intended (n = 677)]. It was assumed that all pregnan- 
cies in this category involved potentially adverse 
experiences for the mother, given the unwanted, 
uncertain or mistimed nature of the pregnancy. 
The mother was asked two questions regarding 
folic acid use: (1) whether she had taken folic acid 
before pregnancy, and (2) whether she had taken folic 
acid during the ﬁrst 3 months of her pregnancy. 
Dosage and type of preparation of folic acid were not 
speciﬁed. The mother also self-completed a sensitive 
CASI questionnaire, which asked whether she had 
smoked during the course of her pregnancy or drank 
alcohol during the course of her pregnancy. 

included whether 
there were any complications during the child’s birth 
(yes/no), whether the child was born LBW (<2500 or 
(cid:2)2500 g) and whether 
the child was delivered 
preterm (i.e. earlier than 37 weeks). 

Developmental competencies at 9 months of age was 
assessed using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire 
(ASQ),25 which is a parent-report instrument that pro- 
duces subscale scores and a dichotomous pass/fail 
threshold for each of ﬁve skill areas: communication, 


gross motor, ﬁne motor, problem solving and 
personal-social development. Although Growing Up 
in Ireland asked a set of items that spanned multiple 
age ranges, this analysis uses the 10-month age inter- 
val score as the most appropriate single score for the 
9-month-old infants. Other authors26 have reported 
positively on the use of parent-report methods for 
detecting developmental delay and the ASQ’s psycho- 
metric properties were described as ‘excellent’ in a 
review of such instruments by the American Academy 
of Pediatrics.27 


Maternal depression was indexed using the eight-item 
Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale 
(CESD-8), which is a short self-report screening 
instrument for depression in the general population.28 
Responses are indicated on a four-point rating scale: 
‘rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day)’, ‘some or 
a little of the time (1–2 days)’, ‘occasionally or a mod- 
erate amount of the time (3–4 days)’ and ‘most or all 
of the time (5–7 days)’ with a reference period of the 
previous 7 days. A composite score is calculated by 
summing item responses (range 0–24). Scores can also 
be dichotomised with a score seven or greater sug- 
gesting a clinically signiﬁcant level of psychological 
distress. The CESD has good internal consistency reli- 
ability (alpha = 0.86) and the concurrent validity of the 
scale has been established through its association with 
other depression measures such as the Beck Depres- 
sion Inventory.28 
Maternal perception of the 
child’s temperament 
The six-item fussy-difﬁcult subscale of 
the Infant 
Characteristics Questionnaire was used to index difﬁ- 
cult infant temperament.29 Respondents rate the per- 
ceived ease or difﬁculty of their infant’s temperament 
on a seven-point rating scale with scores at the higher 
end of the spectrum representing a more difﬁcult dis- 
position. The scale has good internal consistency with 
an alpha of 0.79 and test–retest reliability of 0.70 over 
a 30-day interval. Convergence between parent and 
ratings of 0.61 has been 
independent observer 
reported for the fussy-difﬁcult scale.29 





The parental stress scale is an 18-item self-report 
instrument, which was designed to assess parenting 
stress.30 Respondents indicate their level of agreement 
to a series of statements regarding the parenting role 
on a ﬁve-point Likert-scale with responses ranging 
from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The instru- 
ment produces scores for each of four subscales: 
Parental rewards, Parental stressors, Lack of control 
and Parental satisfaction. A total stress score is calcu- 
lated by summing across the four subscales, with 
scores ranging between 18 and 90 (higher scores being 
indicative of higher parenting stress). 

Non-biological mothers were not asked the question 
relating to pregnancy intention (n = 181) and a further 
386 mothers declined to answer the question resulting 
in an analytic sample of 10 567. With the exception of 
income, which was missing for 7.4% of the sample, 
the degree of missing data was relatively small. We 
created a dummy variable for cases missing on 
income to bring them back into the analysis. We ﬁrst 
describe the sociodemographic characteristics of the 
sample by pregnancy intention status and report the 
independent association of each of these factors with 
intention status by ﬁtting log-Poisson regression 
models expressing the risk ratio (RR) and associated 
95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) estimated using a 
Poisson model with robust variance estimator. We 
then estimate the unadjusted and multivariable 
adjusted RRs of engaging in health compromising 
prenatal behaviours adjusting for demographic char- 
acteristics. Finally, we present the unadjusted and 
multivariable adjusted RRs for adverse infant and 
maternal health outcomes adjusting for the set of 
demographic and prenatal 
life style-related behav- 
iours. All analyses were undertaken using stata 
(version 12.0). 

Overall, 40.7% of the sample reported that they had a 
UIP. Table 1 describes the sociodemographic charac- 
teristics of the sample by pregnancy intention status. 
Lower social class, income and education were all 
associated with increased risk for a UIP, as was 
unmarried status. Coming from a white non-Irish or a

black ethic/racial background was also associated 
with increased risk for a UIP. 
Table 2 shows the relationship between pregnancy 
intention and maternal prenatal behaviours control- 
ling for the set of maternal background characteristics 
shown in Table 1. Having a UIP was associated with 
higher risk of smoking and drinking during preg- 
nancy, and attending later on average for the ﬁrst pre- 
natal booking appointment. UIP was also associated 
with a signiﬁcantly lower probability that the mother 
would take periconceptional folic acid or folic acid 
during the ﬁrst 3 months of pregnancy. 
Table 3 provides the unadjusted (model 1) and mul- 
tivariable adjusted RR controlling for maternal back- 
ground characteristics and maternal prenatal health 
behaviours (model 2). Of the three assessed neonatal 
outcomes, only one was associated with pregnancy 
intention status with a UIP being associated with 
increased risk for birthing complications in the ﬁnal 
model (RR 1.08 [95% CI 1.02, 1.14]). Although a UIP 
was associated with signiﬁcantly increased risk of 
failing to meet the developmental milestone typical of 
children of this age on the gross motor component 
of the ASQ, this association was fully eroded in the 
multivariable analysis. 

associated with 
increased risk of scoring above the 80th percentile on 
the Parental Stress Scale, and the effect remained after 
adjustment for confounding variables. Compared with 
those for whom the pregnancy was intended, the RR of 
scoring above the 80th percentile on the parental stress 
scale was 1.27 [95% CI 1.16, 1.38] among those who 
characterised their pregnancy as unintended. A UIP 
was also associated with signiﬁcantly higher risk of 
obtaining a clinically signiﬁcant depression score on 
the CESD (RR 1.36 [95% CI 1.19, 1.54]).

This study has conﬁrmed that sociodemographic and 
socio-economic factors are associated with UIP, and 
that UIP is a risk factor for a range of prenatal behav- 
iours that are deleterious to fetal health. There was 
little evidence to suggest that pregnancy intention has 
any impact on early infant health outcomes when we 
control for maternal background characteristics and 
maternal health behaviours during pregnancy. Indeed,

pregnancy intention was associated with only one of 
the three neonatal outcomes. UIP was associated with 
only one of the ﬁve ASQ components and the excess 
risk of gross motor delay was fully attenuated in the 
ﬁnal model. 
There was, however, strong evidence that UIP has a 
bearing on the mother’s psychosocial health as evi- 
denced by higher rates of depression and higher rates 
of parenting stress among those for whom the preg- 
nancy was unintended. These ﬁndings are suggestive 
of a parent–child relationship that is under strain and 
may provide a potential mediating pathway through 
which pregnancy intention can come to inﬂuence later 
outcomes.5,6 Indeed, a common ﬁnding in the litera- 
ture is that children who are exposed to a caregiving 
environment in which the mother is suffering from 
major depressive illness are at increased risk for a 
range of adverse health outcomes, including emo- 
tional and behavioural maladjustment.31 
This study has several limitations. First, the time 
horizon for assessing the consequences of UIP is small 
as it spans only the ﬁrst 9 months of the infant’s life. 
Second, some investigators32,33 have questioned the 
validity of using retrospective reports of pregnancy 
intention because of response biases resulting from ex 
post rationalisation of pregnancy intention. It should 
be acknowledged however that the effects may be 
under or overestimated1 and that analysis of data from 
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth cohort 
revealed that the association between UIPs and chil- 
dren’s outcomes did not differ appreciably when 
intention was assessed prospectively compared with 
retrospectively.18 Third, although higher 
rates of 
maternal depression among those with unwanted and 
mistimed pregnancies were documented, a baseline 
measure for maternal depression was not available so 
it is difﬁcult to establish in a cross-sectional study 
whether the relationship is causal. Finally, it could be 
argued that the sample is highly selective as the 
sample was selected from the CBR at 9 months of age 
and hence excludes women who aborted their preg- 
nancies. This group may differ in a number of impor- 
tant ways from those who went on to deliver an 
unwanted pregnancy. However, given that abortion is 
in Ireland, except in very strict circum- 
not legal 
stances, this may not present a large challenge to the 
validity of the results. 
Among the major strengths of the study is the large 
the sample, which 
and representative nature of 
amounts to approximately one-sixth of all livebirths in 
Ireland during this period, which allows for the esti- 
mation of robust main effects. In addition, we were 
able to examine the impact of pregnancy intention 
across a wide range of prenatal, neonatal and child 
outcomes in the ﬁrst 9 months of life, as well as the 
effect of intention status on the parent–child dynamic 
which has been identiﬁed as a major shortcoming in 
the literature.19 The ﬁnding that UIP is associated with 
health compromising behaviours during pregnancy 
and adverse maternal psychosocial health has clear 
policy implications. Ascertaining the mother’s preg- 
nancy intention during the ﬁrst antenatal visit may 
represent an opportunity to monitor those at greatest 
risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes, and allow for 
the development of interventions that may mitigate 
the risk among those with unintended pregnancies. 

The Growing Up in Ireland data have been funded by 
the Government of Ireland through the Department of 
Children and Youth Affairs; have been collected under 
the Statistics Act, 1993, of the Central Statistics Ofﬁce. 
The project has been designed and implemented 
by the joint Economic and Social Research Institute- 
Trinity College Dublin Growing Up in Ireland Study 
Team. 
The authors would also like to thank the members 
of the Growing Up in Ireland Project and Study 
teams, and James Williams, Aisling Murray and 
Amanda Quail for providing additional information 
on study sampling and weighting.
