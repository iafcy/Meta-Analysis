Factors related to depression during pregnancy: are 
there gender differences? 

ABSTRACT 
Objective: To determine gender differences between 
women and their partners in the effect of psychosocial 
and personal factors on depression during the third 
trimester of pregnancy. 
Method: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 
687 women and their partners (n = 669) attending the 
prenatal programme of Valencia province (Spain). Data 
collection was carried out by means of a self-reported 
questionnaire. The outcome variable was depression 
during the third trimester of pregnancy measured by the 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Predictor variables 
were psychosocial (marital dissatisfaction, confidant and 
affective social support) and personal (previous history of 
depression, partner depression and unplanned pregnancy) 
variables. The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their 95% 
confidence intervals were calculated by fitting a logistic 
regression model. 
Results: The prevalence of pregnancy depression was 
higher among women (10.3%) than men (6.5%). In both 
sexes, the probability of depression during pregnancy was 
higher in those with marital dissatisfaction (aOR 3.05, 
95% CI 1.59 to 5.82 for women and 3.14, 95% CI 1.24 to 
7.99 for men) and among those whose with a previous 
history of depression (aOR 2.18, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.89 for 
women and 5.22, 95% CI 2.05 to 13.34 for men). 
Unplanned pregnancy did not increase the risk of 
pregnancy depression either in women or men. Gender 
differences were found on the impact of social support 
and partner’s depression. Whereas among men low 
affective social support and partner depression were 
associated with a higher probability of reporting depres- 
sion, none of these variables were related to women’s 
depression. 
Conclusion: Most predictor factors of depression during 
pregnancy are similar for both sexes but a gender- 
different impact of social support and partner depression 
on pregnancy depression was appreciated. Health 
professionals should be aware of potentially vulnerable 
groups for early diagnosis of pregnancy depression and to 
provide effective interventions. 
The transition to parenthood starts during preg- 
nancy when parents begin to form emotional 
bonds with the unborn child and continues for a 
certain time after childbirth. Therefore, significant 
emotional and interpersonal adjustments are 
necessary.1 Consequently, parents are more vulner- 
able to psychiatric illnesses during the postnatal 
period. Evidence suggests that postpartum depres- 
sion can be part of a continuum, with the onset of 
illness during pregnancy.2 Nevertheless, previous 
research has focused on examining the risk factors 
of depression mainly during the postpartum 
period. Moreover, more attention has been paid 
to the problem of postpartum depression among 
women, but paternal postpartum depression is a 
relatively unrecognised phenomenon.3 
The prevalence of postpartum depression in 
mothers has been consistently reported as between 
8% and 28%,4 5 and for fathers it varies from 5% to 
13%,6 7 
in the early postpartum period. The 
prevalence of maternal depression during preg-

The scientific literature has highlighted the 
influence of personal and psychosocial risk factors 
(past history of depression, stressful 
life events, 
low social support) during pregnancy9 and post- 
partum depression.3 6 10–12 Findings concerning the 
effect of marital problems10 11 13–16 and unplanned 
pregnancy on postpartum depression are, however, 
not consistent.10 17 18 A limited number of studies 
have addressed the study of fathers’ depression risk 
factors during pregnancy and the postnatal period, 
but a recent meta-analysis showed that maternal 
depression was a strong predictor of postpartum 
depression among fathers.3 
The aim of this study was to determine gender 
differences between women and their partners in 
the effect of psychosocial (marital dissatisfaction, 
factors (previous 
social support) and personal 
history of depression, partner’s depression and 
unplanned pregnancy) on depression during the 
third trimester of pregnancy. 
METHOD 
Study design and setting 
A cross-sectional survey was carried out over a 
sample of 769 women selected by means of 
consecutive sampling from January to December 
2005. A total of 769 women in their third trimester 
of pregnancy (between 28 and 31 weeks of 
pregnancy) and their partners attending the pre- 
natal programme in 10 primary care centres of 
Valencia province (Spain) were recruited into the 
study. Response rates were 89.34% for women and 
87% for men, obtaining a sample of 687 and 669 
subjects, respectively. We did not find significant 
differences in the distribution of age, educational 
level, native country, and occupational social class 
between respondent and non-respondent women, 
although the percentage of women without 
slightly higher among non- 
employment was 
respondent women than among 
respondent 
women (34.6% versus 20.8%). 



Data collection 
Data collection was carried out by means of a self-reported 
questionnaire handed out by the midwife to women and their 
partners. Women completed the questionnaire at the primary 
care centre and fathers at home. All participants gave written 
informed consent. 
Measurements 
Outcome variable 
Depression during the third trimester of pregnancy was assessed 
by means of the validated Spanish version of the Edinburgh 
Postnatal Depression Scale, using a threshold score of 12/13.19 
This validation has not determined the cut-off score in fathers, 
so as Matthey et al20 suggested, a two-point lower cut-off score 
(>11) was used. 
Predictor variables 
Psychosocial variables 
Two variables were analysed (marital satisfaction and social 
support). Marital satisfaction was measured using the ENRICH 
Marital Satisfaction Scale (10 items)21 adapted to the Spanish 
cultural context (translation and back-translation). Each item 
was rated on a four-point scale. The total score was categorised 
into high (.24 for women, .25 for men) and low ((24 for 
women, (25 for men) from the values obtained in a one- 
dimensional cluster analysis. 
The Duke-UNC functional social support questionnaire (11 
items) validated for Spain22 23 was used to measure functional 
elements of social support. This 11-item questionnaire has two 
subscales: affective social support (four items) to measure 
positive affective expressions and confidant social support 
(seven items), including such social functions as a confidant 
relationship. Each item was rated on a five-category Likert 
format. Both subscales were dichotomised into high and low, 
taking 15 percentile points as the cutpoint. 
Personal variables 
Previous history of depression, partner’s pregnancy depression 
and unplanned pregnancy were included. 
Adjusting variables 
Some previous studies have shown a relationship between 
postpartum depression and several personal, socio-professional 
(negative life events, age, employment, couple’s occupational 
social class, parity, native country, weekly hours devoted to 
domestic chores)10 12 24–29 and obstetric variables (hyperemesis 
gravidarum, vaginal bleeding, pre-eclampsia).10 30 31 
The presence or absence of negative life events during the past 
12 months was measured from five questions (serious illness or 
death of a close family member, serious illness or death of a 
close friend, separation or divorce, partner’s loss of job, and 
serious economic problems), considering that one presented 
unfavourable life events if at least one of the events mentioned 
above was present. Couples’ occupational social class was 
assigned according to the occupation of the woman or her 
partner (whichever was higher) and was coded with a widely 
used Spanish adaptation of the British classification.32 
Statistical analysis 
After a descriptive analysis of the sample, logistic regression 
models separated by sex and adjusted for personal, socio- 
professional and obstetric factors were fitted in order to 
estimate the associations between predictor variables and 
depression during the third trimester of pregnancy. Adjusted 
odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were the 
measures of association obtained after fitting these models. 
Analyses were conducted using Stata 8 software (Stata Corp, 
College Station, Texas, USA). 
RESULTS 
Description of the sample 
The distribution of depression during the third trimester of 
pregnancy, psychosocial, personal and obstetric characteristics 
of the sample are shown in table 1. The prevalence of depression 
during pregnancy was higher among women (10.3%) than 
among men (6.5%). Among men whose partners were 
experiencing pregnancy depression, the prevalence of pregnancy 
depression was 14.5% and conversely 23.3% of mothers 
experienced depression during pregnancy when their partners 
did. The percentage of couples in which at least one parent 
experienced depression during pregnancy was 15.1%. The 
prevalence of psychosocial factors and of personal factors was 
similar for both sexes, but the prevalence of a previous history 
of depression was lower among men (9.8% versus 21.4%). 
Concerning socio-professional factors, percentages were also 
similar except for age and domestic chores. Fathers were older 
and spent less time doing housework. 
Multivariate results 
Low marital satisfaction increased the probability of depression 
during pregnancy in women and men. Among men low 
affective social support was associated with depression during 
pregnancy, OR 3.92 (95% CI 1.61 to 9.53). Previous depression 
increased the probability of pregnancy depression among fathers 
and mothers. Among fathers, partner’s pregnancy depression 
increased the risk of pregnancy depression, OR 2.89 (95% CI 
1.14 to 7.31). The same trend appeared for mothers but the 
association was not statistically significant and the magnitude 
of the effect was much lower. Unplanned pregnancy did not 
increase the risk of depression during pregnancy either in men or 
women (table 2). 
DISCUSSION 
To our knowledge, this is one of the largest studies of depression 
during pregnancy that includes both mothers and fathers 
among a non-selected population. In addition, we have included 
the most potentially possible psychosocial and personal risk 
factors highlighted by the scientific literature. This manuscript 
presents both similarities and differences between mothers and 
fathers in the effect of psychosocial (marital satisfaction, social 
support) and personal factors (previous history of depression, 
partner’s depression during the third trimester of pregnancy and 
unplanned pregnancy) on depression during the third trimester 
of pregnancy, measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression 
Scale, among a sample of mothers and their partners from 
Valencia (Spain). The study has produced two main findings: 
(1) the prevalence of depression during pregnancy was higher 
among women and (2) although most psychosocial and 
personal factors associated with depression during pregnancy 
were similar for both sexes, low affective social support and 
partner’s depression were only related to men’s depression. 
Marital dissatisfaction and a previous history of depression were 
predictors of pregnancy depression in both mothers and fathers. 
Unplanned pregnancy did not increase the risk of depression 
during pregnancy either in men or women. We found a 
differential effect, however, of social support and partner’s

Odds ratio (OR) adjusted by personal, socio-professional (negative life events, age, employment, occupational social class, parity,

differences include a real difference in the experience of 
depression, under-reporting of depression symptoms by men, 
either because of a poorer recall of these symptoms by men, or 
men expressing disturbed effect through different symptoms 
than those assessed on diagnostic interviews or self-report 
measures.4 
Consistent with previously reported findings, a strong 
association was identified between poor marital relationships 
and depression during pregnancy in both sexes10 11 37–39 and the 
magnitude of effect was similar. 
Affective social support was associated with pregnancy 
depression in men, whereas social support was not associated 
with depression among women. Other authors6 10–12 40 found 
similar results, although they usually used a global social 
support scale. 
It has often been reported that the most reliable predictor of 
prenatal and postnatal depression in mothers6 10 11 37 and in 
fathers is a previous history of depression6 and our findings are 
consistent with this. 
Consistently with other authors, we found that maternal 
pregnancy depression was a strong predictor of pregnancy 
depression in men.3 7 39 41 Interestingly, we found the same trend 
in mothers, but the association was not statistically significant. 
As reported by Schmiege and Russo17 our results do not 
support 
the theory that unplanned pregnancy increases 
pregnancy depression in mothers and their partners. It is 
legal access to 
possible that under present conditions of 
abortion, there is no credible evidence that choosing to 
terminate an unplanned pregnancy puts fathers at greater risk 
of subsequent depression.17 
It is important to point out some possible limitations of this 
study. The cross-sectional nature of data leaves inferences about 
the causal direction of the effect of psychosocial and personal 
factors on depression during pregnancy. 
It is not known 
whether the factors associated with pregnancy depression 
occurred before or after the depressive period. Gender-different 
patterns in predictor variables still deserve further attention. So 
far, attention has been paid to women’s depression during and, 
primarily, after pregnancy. The impact of women’s depression 
on their partner’s mental health should, however, be analysed, 
as well as the role of affective social support as being protective 
of men’s depression during pregnancy. 
Implications for practice and research 
Depression during pregnancy and the puerperium is a serious 
mental health problem for women and its consequences have 
serious implications for the welfare of the family and the 
psychological development of the child.11 Louma et al42 in a

depression, stressful life events, low social support) on

depression risk factors during pregnancy and the postnatal 
period 

We found a differential effect of social support and partner’s 
depression on pregnancy depression between men and women. 
Whereas low affective social support and partner’s depression 
had a negative impact on pregnancy depression among men, 
none of these variables were related to women’s depression. 
Therefore, 
further research should be carried out, combining 
quantitative and qualitative methods, to explain these possible 
gender differences. 


longitudinal study found that maternal depressive symptoms at 
any time, especially antenatally, were a risk factor for the child’s 
wellbeing and the recurrence of maternal depressive symptoms. 
Also recurrence and antenatal depression were associated with 
the least favourable child outcome. As a result of serious 
consequences, doctors and midwives should be aware of 
potentially vulnerable groups (women experiencing marital 
problems, women with a previous history of depression, those 
who have low social support) 
for an early diagnosis of 
pregnancy depression and to provide effective interventions 
(treatment, to provide services targeting social support). 
Our results strongly support the theory that psychosocial 
(marital satisfaction, social support) and personal (previous 
depression, partner’s pregnancy depression) factors were strong 
predictors of pregnancy depression in both mothers and fathers. 
A gender-different 
support and partner 
depression on pregnancy depression was, however, appreciated. 
Therefore, further research should be carried out, combining 
quantitative and qualitative methods, to explain these possible 
gender differences.
