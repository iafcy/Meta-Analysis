Pregnancy Intention and Preterm Birth: Differential 
Associations Among a Diverse Population of Women 
By Aimee Afable- 
Munsuz and Paula 
Braveman 
CONTEXT: Studies published to date provide mixed evidence on the relationship between unintended pregnancy and 
preterm birth, and none take into consideration that the meaning of unintended pregnancy may vary across racial and 
ethnic groups.

METHODS: Data from the 1999–2003 rounds of the Maternal and Infant Health Assessment, a population-based, 
representative survey of postpartum women in California, were used to assess the relationship between pregnancy 
intention and preterm birth. For racial and ethnic groups in which an association was found, sequential logistic 
regression was conducted to further examine the relationship while controlling for socioeconomic characteristics. 
RESULTS: In unadjusted results, pregnancy intention was associated with preterm birth among both whites and 
immigrant Latinas,but not among blacks or U.S.-born Latinas. Among whites,compared with women who reported that 
their pregnancy was intended, those who were unsure about their pregnancy had elevated odds of preterm birth (odds 
ratio, 1.4), as did those who reported their pregnancy was unwanted (1.7) or mistimed (1.4). Among immigrant Latinas, 
those who reported being unsure about their pregnancy were at higher risk of preterm birth than were those who 
reported an intended pregnancy (1.6). After adjustment for socioeconomic factors, the association remained signiﬁcant 
for immigrant Latinas who were unsure about their pregnancy (1.5), but none of the associations remained signiﬁcant 
for whites. 
CONCLUSIONS: Women’s interpretations of questions about pregnancy intention and their social experiences 
regarding pregnancy intention may vary by race or ethnicity. Studies on the association between pregnancy intention 
and preterm birth may need to be group-speciﬁc. 

Almost half (49%) of pregnancies in the United States are 
unintended, and almost half of unintended pregnancies 
end in abortion.1 The demographic groups with the 
highest rates of unintended birth generally are the poor, 
those without a college education, those who are unmar- 
ried, those aged 20–24 years and minorities.1 For exam- 
ple, unintended births occur at a rate of 58 births per 
1,000 women among those with a family income below 
the federal poverty level; this rate is 35 and 40 per 1,000 
among black and Latina women, respectively, in compar- 
ison with 22 per 1,000 among all women in the United 
States.1 

Unintended pregnancy has repeatedly been shown to 
be associated with a range of poor maternal and infant 
low birth 
health indicators, 
weight and inadequate well-baby care, and with poor 
social outcomes.2–12 Preterm birth has extremely serious 
adverse consequences for infant mortality and both short- 
and long-term morbidity and development.13–15 Unin- 
tended pregnancy might influence the risk of preterm 
birth by modifying a woman’s psychological state—for 
example, by contributing to depression or psychological 
stress.12,16–22 In addition, a woman who did not plan 
a pregnancy might not be aware of one early on, and thus 
might not engage in health-promoting maternal behav- 
iors, such as cessation of smoking or harmful drug use, in 
a timely manner.2,3 However, studies published to date 
provide mixed evidence on the relationship between 
unintended pregnancy and preterm birth, and none take 
into consideration that 
the meaning of unintended 
pregnancy may vary across racial and ethnic groups.23–25 
According to conventional classifications,1,2 unin- 
tended pregnancies are ones that are mistimed (occur 
earlier than wanted) or unwanted (not wanted at any 
time). Estimates of unintended pregnancy rates are 
usually based on retrospective reports, collected in 
surveys some time after a birth or a pregnancy termina- 
tion. However, a retrospective approach has inherent 
limitations. Some research suggests that reported inten- 
tions become more positive with time after the child is 
born,26,27 while other research suggests that reports may 
become more negative with time, reflecting a partner’s 
and family’s reactions to the unexpected pregnancy.28 
Furthermore, because unintended pregnancy rates differ 
markedly by race and ethnicity, researchers have begun to 
question the meaning of unintended pregnancy and, 
consequently, its measurement across social groups of 
women.23–25,29–36 



Qualitative studies suggest that the idea of planning 
a pregnancy may have limited relevance for some groups 
of women. A study that was based on in-depth interviews 
with low-income black adolescent women in New 
Orleans found an inconsistency between their expressed 
desire to postpone pregnancy and their observed behav- 
ior, manifested in unintended childbearing. The research- 
ers suggest 
the interplay between community 
acceptance of teenage pregnancy, limited socioeconomic 
opportunities, and imperfect knowledge of and access to 
reproductive health care may make it difficult for young 
black women to realize their intentions.24,25 Barrett and 
Wellings, who conducted in-depth interviews with a di- 
verse group of women in London, suggest that a planned 
pregnancy is a somewhat idealized goal, regardless of 
women’s socioeconomic status. According to those inter- 
viewed, achieving a planned pregnancy requires that 
women deliberately decide to become pregnant, tempo- 
rarily discontinue any contraceptive use, be in agreement 
with their partner and reach the right time in terms of 
lifestyle or life stage.30 Indeed, even for women who 
believe they have control over any one of these factors, 
having control over all of them simultaneously presents 
an even greater challenge. 
PREGNANCY INTENTION AND PRETERM BIRTH 
It is important to consider the findings of studies on the 
associations between pregnancy intention and preterm 
birth in light of the potentially varied meaning of preg- 
nancy intention across social groups of women. A pro- 
spective study of 434 women receiving prenatal care in 
Belgium found a positive association between unintended 
pregnancy and preterm birth after adjustment for wom- 
en’s medical risk status and socioeconomic status, 
although this study did not use the conventional intend- 
edness classifications.7 A prospective study of 922 low- 
income black women recruited at prenatal clinics in 
Baltimore found a positive association between unin- 
tended pregnancy, using the conventional classification, 
and preterm birth after other medical risk factors were 
adjusted for.8 Another study, using 1995 National Survey 
of Family Growth (NSFG) data, found a higher risk of 
preterm birth among women whose pregnancies were 
mistimed by two years or more than among those who 
had intended pregnancies.9 
On the other hand, three clinic-based studies found no 
evidence of an association between preterm birth and 
unintended pregnancy. One included 1,908 women (the 
majority of whom were white) in North Carolina,12 one 
was conducted among 416 low-income black women in 
Harlem10 and one involved 1,404 women recruited from 
a prenatal clinic in northwestern Russia.11 
Furthermore, other studies have shown that the asso- 
ciation between unintended pregnancy and other mater- 
nal, infant and child health outcomes diminishes and 
sometimes disappears after adjustment for maternal 
socioeconomic variables.3,4,6 All of these studies were 
based on data sets with relatively extensive socioeco- 
nomic information (e.g., the National Longitudinal Sur- 
vey of Youth), and used multiple socioeconomic 
variables, including mother’s family structure at age 14, 
receipt of public assistance, mother’s education, mother’s 
labor force status and family income. The studies dis- 
cussed above, however, had little information on socio- 
economic status, and all but one relied on data from 
prenatal clinics; these facts limit the ability to assess 
potential confounding and generalizability. 
The current study was conducted to examine the 
relationship between unintended pregnancy and pre- 
term birth in a large, population-based sample of racially 
and ethnically diverse postpartum women with more 
extensive socioeconomic information than has been 
available in prior studies. Specifically, the analysis inves- 
tigates the following research questions: Is unintended 
pregnancy associated with preterm birth among the 
general population of childbearing women and among 
childbearing women of different racial and ethnic groups 
in California? If so, do socioeconomic factors confound 
the relationship? 
METHODS 
Study Design 
We used five years (1999–2003) of data from the 
California Maternal and Infant Health Assessment 
(MIHA). MIHA, a collaborative project of the state 
health department’s Maternal and Child Health/Office 
of Family Planning Branch and the University of 
California, San Francisco, is an annual survey of women 
having live births in California from February through 
May; its data are linked with birth certificate data, which 
provide the sampling frame. Women are eligible to 
participate in MIHA if they are English- or Spanish- 
speaking state residents; are 15 or older; had singleton, 
twin or triplet births; and had addresses recorded on 
birth certificates. The sample is stratified according to 
region in California and woman’s education and race or 
ethnicity, and selected randomly from within those 
strata; blacks are oversampled. Approximately 3,500 
women are interviewed each year, and the sample is 
representative of the more than 150,000 women who 
give birth in California during the four-month assess- 
ment period. 
MIHA includes a range of questions on maternal and 
infant health and maternal socioeconomic and demo- 
graphic characteristics. Surveys in English and Spanish 
are mailed to women 10–14 weeks after they have given 
birth; two weeks after the initial mailing, reminder post- 
cards are sent to nonrespondents, and three weeks after 
the reminders, a second mailing of questionnaires is sent. 
Telephone contact is attempted with nonrespondents 
and those whose surveys are returned because of incor- 
rect addresses. In 1999–2003, surveys were completed 2– 
7 months after the surveys were mailed. Questionnaires 
were completed by mail for about 75% of respondents 



and by telephone for about 25%; 75% of the surveys were 
completed in English, and 25% in Spanish. 
In 1999–2003, a total of 17,725 women completed the 
MIHA survey. The response rate was 72% overall, but was 
somewhat lower (63–68%) among subgroups who tradi- 
tionally are less likely than average to participate in mail or 
telephone surveys (those with less than a high school 
education, black women and Latina women born outside 
the United States). However, the maternal characteristics 
of the sample are similar to those of all eligible women 
who gave birth statewide (information available upon 
request). 
A survey question combining race and ethnicity was 
used in conjunction with birth certificate information on 
birthplace to create seven mutually exclusive racial and 
ethnic group categories: black, U.S.-born Asian, immi- 
grant Asian, U.S.-born Latina, immigrant Latina, Native 
American and white. There were too few immigrant 
blacks or immigrant whites to examine separately. 
U.S.-born Asians and Native Americans were excluded 
from selected analyses because sample sizes were small; 
immigrant Asians were excluded because the sample 
likely was not representative, as the survey was not 
translated into any Asian languages. White women made 
up the largest proportion of the sample, followed by 
immigrant Latinas, U.S.-born Latinas and blacks. The 
analysis was limited to women reporting singleton births, 
as women with multiple births have a different risk profile 
for preterm birth.37,38 The final sample size for the 
primary analyses was 15,331; women who did not report 
race or ethnicity and those who were Asian or Native 
American were excluded.

Study Variables 
From birth certificate data on gestational age, we identi- 
fied women who had a preterm birth, defined as a birth at 
less than 37 weeks of gestation. We used several measures 
to reflect socioeconomic status: educational attainment of 
the woman and of her baby’s father, and family income (as 
a percentage of the federal poverty level, which was es- 
timated using published guidelines from the U.S. Census 
Bureau for the relevant year39). Because both young age at 
first birth and single parenthood have repeatedly been 
associated with socioeconomic disadvantage,2 we also 
included the relevant demographic variables: maternal 
age, parity and marital status. 
The main independent variable is pregnancy intention, 
categories—intended, mistimed, 
defined with four 
unwanted and unsure. Because mistimed and unwanted 
pregnancies might be qualitatively distinct and might 
have differential impacts on pregnancy outcomes,2,9,33 
intention status was analyzed as a four-category variable 
(intended vs. mistimed vs. unwanted vs. unsure), as 
opposed to a dichotomous variable (unintended vs. 
intended).9 The following MIHA question (modeled on 
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System and 
NSFG questions) was used to construct the pregnancy 
intention measure: ‘‘Thinking back to just before you got 
pregnant, how did you feel about getting pregnant?’’ 
Response choices are ‘‘I wanted to get pregnant then’’ 
(indicating that the pregnancy was intended), ‘‘I wanted 
to get pregnant later’’ (it was mistimed), ‘‘I didn’t want to 
get pregnant then or in the future’’ (it was unwanted) and 
‘‘I wasn’t sure what I wanted.’’ Consistent with other 
research utilizing MIHA data, women who reported that 
their pregnancy was mistimed or unwanted or that they 
were unsure about their pregnancy were classified as 
having an unintended pregnancy;40 our definition is 
modeled after the conventional definition but also in- 
cludes ‘‘unsure’’ responses. 
Analytic Approach 
MIHA data were statistically weighted so that results can 
be generalized to the statewide population of eligible 
women with live births in the years 1999–2003. We used 
SAS41 to describe sample characteristics and SUDAAN42 
to construct logistic regression models. Unadjusted odds 
ratios examining predictors of preterm birth (with 95% 
confidence intervals) were calculated first among all 
women and then within each racial and ethnic group. 
Racial and ethnic groups in which preterm birth was 
associated with unintended pregnancy were further 
analyzed through sequential multiple regression. Each 
model in these analyses added one of the following 
variables to the unadjusted model: family income, re- 
spondent’s education, paternal education, age, parity and 
marital status. We examined changes in odds ratios and 
95% confidence intervals and log-likelihood ratio tests for 
each model to assess how the addition of each variable 
affected the associations and to assess the practical 
significance of the contribution of each variable to each 
successive model. We also constructed a full model that 
adjusted for all socioeconomic factors related to preterm 
birth. (Models in which there were no significant associ- 
ations are not shown.) 
RESULTS 
Sample Characteristics 
Overall, 9% of women in this sample had a preterm birth; 
the proportion ranged from 8% among white and U.S.-born 
Asian women to 14–15% among blacks and Native Amer- 
icans (Table 1). Thirteen percent of the women reported 
being unsure about pregnancy intention, 9% reported that 
their pregnancies were unwanted and 25% reported that 
their pregnancies were mistimed. In total, 46% of these 
pregnancies were unintended. The proportion of women 
reporting unintended pregnancy ranged from 38% among 
white women to 59–66% among U.S.-born Latinas, Native 
Americans and black women. 
The proportion of women who were college graduates 
ranged from 5% among immigrant Latinas to 52% among 
immigrant Asians. Among U.S. born-Latinas, 23% of 
births were among women aged 15–19; 2% of births 
among immigrant Asians were to women in this age- 
group. Finally, the proportion of women reporting being 
unmarried ranged from 13% among immigrant Asians to 
65% among blacks.

Odds of Preterm Birth by Racial or Ethnic Group 
Women who did not intend their pregnancy had an 
elevated likelihood of preterm birth (Table 2, page 69). 
Compared with those whose pregnancy was intended, 
women who were unsure about their pregnancy were at 
higher risk of preterm birth (odds ratio, 1.4), as were 
those reporting their pregnancy as unwanted (1.4) or 
mistimed (1.2). The risk of preterm birth was associated 
with unintendedness among white women (unsure, 1.4; 
unwanted, 1.7; and mistimed, 1.4) and among immigrant 
Latinas (unsure, 1.6), but not among black or U.S.-born 
Latina women. Thus, multivariate analyses are presented 
only for whites and immigrant Latinas. 
Among white women, adjustment for income alone had 
the greatest effect on the likelihood of preterm birth, 
resulting in nonsignificant odds ratios for all categories of 
pregnancy intention (Table 3). With the addition of 
maternal education, paternal education or marital status, 
the relationship between unintended pregnancy and 
preterm birth was attenuated: Women who reported an 
unwanted pregnancy—but not those who reported being 
unsure about the pregnancy or those who considered 
their pregnancy mistimed—were at higher risk of preterm 
birth than were women who reported an intended 
pregnancy (odds ratio, 1.5 in each model). Adding age 
or parity did not influence the observed association 
between any of the pregnancy intention categories and 
preterm birth risk, and did not make a significant contri- 
bution to the model with pregnancy intention alone, 
according to the log-likelihood ratio test (not shown). 
Adjusting for all socioeconomic factors simultaneously 
resulted in nonsignificant odds ratios for all categories of 
pregnancy intention among white women. 
Adjustment for individual socioeconomic factors did 
not appreciably influence the association between preg- 
nancy intention and preterm birth among immigrant 
Latina women (Table 4). However, adjustments for 
maternal education, paternal education, age, marital 
status and parity made significant contributions to vari- 
ation in preterm birth risk, according to the log-likelihood 
ratio tests. After adjustment for all socioeconomic factors 
simultaneously, immigrant Latina women who reported 
being unsure about their pregnancy remained at an 
increased risk of preterm birth (odds ratio, 1.5). 
DISCUSSION 
Utilizing population-based information from a diverse 
sample of postpartum women in California, our study 
demonstrates that the relationship between pregnancy 
intention and preterm birth varies by women’s racial or 
ethnic group. After adjustment for the socioeconomic and 
demographic variables in our study, pregnancy intention

was significantly related to preterm birth among immi- 
grant Latinas, but not among white, black or U.S.-born 
Latina women. These findings both conflict with and 
support previous studies that found that the association 
between unintended pregnancy and other maternal and 
infant health outcomes disappeared after adequate 
adjustment for socioeconomic factors.3–6 The unique 
pattern observed among immigrant Latinas suggests that 
the socioeconomic factors we measured may play differ- 
ent roles in relation to pregnancy intention and preterm 
birth for different groups of women. This finding is 
consistent with the poorly understood but widely 
observed paradox of good birth outcomes among Latinas, 
despite high levels of socioeconomic disadvantage.43–47 
Limitations 
Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, 
our study is cross-sectional, limiting our ability to make 
causal inferences about the relationship between unin- 
tended pregnancy or socioeconomic factors and preterm 
birth. Another limitation, noted earlier, is the retrospec- 
tive measurement of unintended pregnancy, which can be 
resolved only with a longitudinal study design. Similarly, 
although our measure of preterm birth came from birth 
certificates, it was based in part on the mother’s report of 
her last menstrual period, which may be subject to 
reporting error.48,49 Further, despite the large sample 
size overall, we had insufficient numbers of Native 
American and U.S.-born Asian women for analysis, and 
our sample of Asian immigrants may not have been 
representative of this population statewide. Also, we 
focused on socioeconomic factors that might confound 
the relationship between unintended pregnancy and 
preterm birth; other, unmeasured determinants of pre- 
term birth may also vary by racial or ethnic group. 
In interpreting this study’s findings, it is important to 
keep in mind that we analyzed data only on pregnancies 
ending in live births (as did the studies of preterm birth 
discussed previously). In a setting where abortion is legal 
and largely accessible, as it is here in the United States, 
one could argue that women with truly unwanted preg- 
nancies obtain abortions.50 To the extent that abortion is 
safe and accessible, analyses of live births involve only 
a subset of unintended pregnancies—those on the ‘‘more 
desirable’’ end of the spectrum. Abortions that are denied 
to women, however, can have the most serious conse- 
longitudinal 
quences for mother and child. In fact, 
European studies of women who had abortion requests 
denied have found severe negative effects on the 
long-term psychosocial development.51,52 
children’s 
Where abortion is illegal and unsafe, unintended preg- 
nancy is a major contributor to maternal morbidity and 



mortality.53,54 In our study, the exclusion of terminated 
pregnancies may explain both the differential association 
and the lack of association between unintended preg- 
nancy ending in live births and preterm birth, given that 
abortion rates vary by racial or ethnic group.1 
Conclusion 
These findings have several important implications for 
research, as well as for program and policy development. 
They call into question the belief in an association between 
unintended pregnancy and preterm birth, at least among 
certain racial and ethnic groups, and they suggest that 
studies of pregnancy intention and preterm birth cannot 
be generalized across racial or ethnic groups, perhaps 
because of variations across groups in social experiences. 
Our findings also add to concerns about the measurement 
and meaning of unintended pregnancy, particularly 
among diverse populations. Although the varied mean- 
ings of the conventional pregnancy intention categories 
have been explored qualitatively,24,30 more research is 
needed, particularly among immigrant Latina women. 
Longitudinal investigations of how pregnancy intentions 
might change over time, whether the direction of change 
varies by racial or ethnic group or by socioeconomic 
factors, and how pregnant women’s social and health care 
context shapes their stated intentions would seem prom- 
ising. Such inquiries could help us achieve a more nuanced 
understanding of women’s pregnancy goals and desires, 
which in turn could inform the development of alternative 
and more meaningful measures of pregnancy intention. 
To the extent that our study suggests an association 
between socioeconomic factors and the risk of preterm 
birth, programs and policies need to address women’s 
socioeconomic conditions to have an impact on their risk 
of preterm birth. To the extent that the current under- 
standing of pregnancy intention has meaning and impli- 
cations for maternal and infant health, efforts should be 
made to ensure women’s access to reproductive health 
care, including by preserving public health safety net 
measures for immigrants, to have an impact on both 
women’s fertility goals and their risk of preterm birth.
