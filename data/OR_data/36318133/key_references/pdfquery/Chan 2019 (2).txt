Abstract 
This study set out to fill the research gap by including various aspects of 
father involvement and intimate partner violence (IPV) in the examination 
of the association between unintended pregnancy and maternal postnatal 
depression (PND). This study aimed to examine the effect of father 
involvement and IPV on the association between unintended pregnancy and 
PND. A sample of 1,083 pregnant women who attended antenatal clinic 
at selected hospitals in Hong Kong completed two surveys to report on 
their pregnancy intention, antenatal depression, PND, IPV during pregnancy, 
their partner’s (i.e., father’s) involvement during pregnancy and after 
childbirth, and perceived social support. Comparisons were made between 
women with unintended pregnancy and those with intended pregnancy, and 
the effects of unintended pregnancy, father involvement, IPV, and other 
factors on maternal PND were examined. Results show that women with 
unintended pregnancy were more likely to report PND, IPV, fear, postnatal 
stress, lower degree of father involvement, and lower level of social support.

Unintended pregnancy independently increased the risk of PND by 1.95 
times (95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.15, 3.28]), after adjustment for all 
other variables. When father involvement was included in the regression 
model, the negative effects of IPV and the related fear on PND became 
nonsignificant. The positive association between unintended pregnancy and 
PND was robust. Father involvement might help promote maternal health 
by reducing the negative effects of IPV on PND.

Postnatal depression (PND) is a major health problem that affects approxi- 
mately 8% to 19% of women globally (Chaudron, 2003). It has been well 
demonstrated in literature that PND could lead to various serious negative 
health consequences on the family as a whole and that it may not only hamper 
mothers’ physical and mental health (World Health Organization, 2008) but 
also affect the health of other family members including their partners and 
children (Leung et al., 2011; McPeak, Sandrock, Spector, & Pattishall, 2015). 
Known risk factors for PND include a previous history of depression, 
antenatal depression and anxiety, stressful life events, young age, low socio- 
economic status, difficult infant temperament, poor marital relationship, and 
a lack of social support (Beck, 2001; Dagher & Shenassa, 2012; Darcy et al., 
2011; Nakku, Nakasi, & Mirembe, 2006; O’Hara & Swain, 1996; Robertson, 
Grace, Wallington, & Stewart, 2004). Among all the identified risk factors in 
literature, unintended pregnancy is one of the most commonly addressed yet 
under-investigated. Unintended pregnancy is not a rare phenomenon, and it 
affects almost half of the mothers in the United States and up to one-fourth of 
the mothers in Asian countries (C. Y. Chan et al., 2013; Finer & Zolna, 2016; 
Koh, Chui, Tang, & Lee, 2014). Past research has demonstrated the link 
between unintended pregnancy and maternal PND (Abajobir, Maravilla, 
Alati, & Najman, 2016; Abbasi, Chuang, Dagher, Zhu, & Kjerulff, 2013; 
Brito, Alves, Ludermir, & Araújo, 2015); however, findings about the under- 
lying mechanisms are scarce. Latest effort often focuses on the moderating 
and/or mediating effects of factors such as ethnicity, stress, and anxiety in 
explaining the association (Abbasi et al., 2013). 
In the recent decade, father involvement at different stages of pregnancy 
and childbirth has attracted increased attention worldwide (K. L. Chan, Emery, 
Fulu, Tolman, & Ip, 2017). It has been shown that father involvement may be 


associated with better maternal health (K. K. L. Chan & Paterson-Brown, 
2002; Dudgeon & Inhorn, 2004), paternal health (Plantin, Olykoya, & Ny, 
2011), infant health (Teitler, 2001), increased partner satisfaction with their 
relationship (Bondas-Salonen, 1998), and reduced intimate partner violence 
(IPV; K. L. Chan et al., 2017). Due to the lack of systematic and comprehen- 
sive empirical studies on father involvement and health, the mechanisms 
underlying the associations between them remain inconclusive. Some prelimi- 
nary research has suggested several possible pathways. For example, father 
involvement during and beyond pregnancy may promote paternal health by 
facilitating development of positive paternal health behaviors, such as cessa- 
tion of smoking, alcohol consumption, or drug use (Bottorff, Radsma, Kelly, 
& Oliffe, 2009). These positive health behaviors among fathers do not only 
promote paternal health; they have been demonstrated to also facilitate both 
maternal and child health, possibly serving as a protective factor against poor 
pregnancy and obstetric outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight 
(Finnbogadottir, Crang, & Persson, 2003). 
Given that the above factors are closely associated with unintended preg- 
nancy and PND (Crempien, Rojas, Cumsille, & Oda, 2011; Walsh, Keyes, 
Koenen, & Hasin, 2015; Wang et al., 2017), father involvement may act as a 
protective factor for reducing the risk of PND among mothers with unin- 
tended pregnancy. Yet, existing research has failed to investigate the influ- 
ence of father involvement during pregnancy and after childbirth, an alterable 
variable, on such associations. This study set out research questions to fill the 
research gap by investigating the role of father involvement in the association 
between unintended pregnancy, IPV, and maternal PND. The research 
hypotheses include the following: (a) unintended pregnancy is associated 
with maternal PND, IPV, and lower level of social support and (b) father 
involvement reduces the negative effects of IPV on PND. 


This study was conducted within a sample of mothers who had attended the 
antenatal check-up during 2016 and 2017 in four major public hospitals in 
Hong Kong. A baseline survey was conducted on the sample during their 
pregnancy, and a follow-up survey was conducted around 4 weeks postpar- 
tum. Sample recruitment was population based. During the study period, all 
pregnant women with less than 24 weeks of gestation who showed up in the 
antenatal clinic in one of the four research sites, namely, Kwong Wah 
Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, and Prince Wales 


Hospital, were considered eligible and invited to participate in the study. To 
ensure the representativeness of the sample, no limit on ethnicity or national- 
ity was set. Those who could not understand Chinese or English, which were 
the main languages used in this study, were excluded from the sample. 
Pregnant women excluded due to language barrier comprised less than 1% of 
the total number of eligible participants. In addition, about 1% of the eligible 
participants who were below the age of 18 years and those who were unable 
to give informed consent were excluded. 

All subject recruitment and data collection procedures were approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of the Hospital Authority Research Ethics 
Committees of all the four selected hospitals, and there was no important 
change made after the commencement of the study. Participation in the study 
was voluntary, informed consent was provided, and anonymity and confiden- 
tiality of information was guaranteed. Once identified as abused, participants 
were encouraged to seek help and were provided with the necessary informa- 
tion for referral. Health professionals at the four hospitals were trained and 
available for assistance in case of emergency. 
During the study period, all eligible pregnant women who attended the 
antenatal clinic of the four hospitals were informed about the study details 
and participant’s rights in private rooms in the hospitals. In particular, they 
were ensured that refusal to participate would not affect any service they 
received at the hospitals. Eligible women who agreed to participate provided 
written consent and completed the baseline survey that assessed their antena- 
tal depression, IPV experiences, pregnancy intention, and demographic char- 
acteristics in the private room. Participants also indicated their preferred 
methods of contact for the follow-up survey after giving birth to their chil- 
dren (e.g., via phone, by mail, by e-mail, etc.). 
About 4 weeks after their expected date of delivery, participants were con- 
tacted for the follow-up survey. They were asked to complete a structured 
questionnaire that assessed their PND, anxiety, stress level, IPV experience, 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL), perceived social support, and the 
degree of father involvement in their pregnancy. During the follow-up sur- 
vey, participants were reminded again their right to refuse participation, to 
terminate the interview, and to ignore any item either verbally or in printed 
form. Anonymity and confidentiality were assured. No incentives were given 
to the participants. Although there was no potential harm expected, medical 
and health professionals at the four hospitals were available for assistance in 
case of emergency. 



Antenatal and PND. Mothers’ levels of depressive symptoms experienced dur- 
ing pregnancy and after childbirth were assessed with the Chinese version of 
the 10-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (CEPDS; Lee et al., 2018). 
Items were rated on a Likert-type scale from 0 to 3. Total scores ranged from 0 
to 30, with higher scores indicating more severe depression levels. This study 
employed a cutoff score of 10, which was recommended to screen for PND in 
the general Chinese population in Hong Kong (Lee et al., 2018). The CEPDS 
demonstrated good reliability in this study, with a Cronbach’s alpha of .85. 
Pregnancy intention. Mothers were asked whether their current pregnancy was 
intended or not with a yes/no item. Responses were then classified as 
“intended pregnancy” or “unintended pregnancy” in this study. 
IPV during pregnancy. Mothers’ experiences of IPV during pregnancy were 
measured using four items modified from the Chinese version of the Abuse 
Assessment Screen (AAS; Tiwari et al., 2007). Items were rated on a yes/no 
(0/1) scale. Three of the four items assessed mothers’ experiences of psycho- 
logical aggression, physical assault, and sexual coercion by their partner 
during pregnancy, and one assessed whether the mothers experienced fear 
from the IPV. 
Father involvement during pregnancy and after childbirth. Father involvement 
was assessed with 10 items developed in this study. The items recorded the 
degree that the fathers provided emotional support for the mothers (one item; 
that is, whether the fathers would comfort their partner when she felt sad), the 
degree that they provided instrumental assistance on daily housework (six 
items; for example, taking care of pregnant women’s diet, feeding the new- 
borns, helping replace the diapers, etc.), the frequency of attending antenatal 
check-ups with the expectant mothers (one item), the frequency of attending 
parent education classes (one item), and the frequency of seeing ultrasound 
pictures during check-ups with the mothers (one item). The items assessing 
father involvement in daily housework and emotional support were rated on 
a 4-point scale from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating higher degree of 
involvement. The father involvement in daily housework demonstrated good 
reliability in this study, with a Cronbach’s alpha of .86. 
Postnatal anxiety and stress. Postnatal anxiety and stress levels were assessed 
using the Chinese version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 
(DASS; Moussa, Lovibond, & Laube, 2011). The seven-item Anxiety and the 


seven-item Stress subscales were used, and all items were rated on a 4-point 
scale, with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety or stress. The Anxi- 
ety and Stress subscales showed good reliabilities in this study, with Cron- 
bach’s alpha of .75 and .84, respectively. 
Postnatal HRQoL. Mothers’ postnatal HRQoL was assessed with the 12-item 
Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12; Lam, Tse, & Gandek, 2005). Scores on 
the SF-12 were computed as two separate composite scores: one for physical 
health–related QoL (PCS) and the other for mental health–related QoL 
(MCS). Both PCS and MCS ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicat- 
ing better health-related QoL. The SF-12 achieved a Cronbach’s alpha of .85, 
indicating good reliability in this study. 
Perceived social support. Mothers’ perceived social support was measured 
using the Chinese version of the 12-item Multidimensional Scale of Per- 
ceived Social Support (MSPSS-C; Chou, 2000). Three sources of support 
were assessed, including support from family (four items), support from 
friends (four items), and support from some significant others (four items). 
Items were rated on a 7-point scale from 1 to 7. The total score ranged from 
12 to 72, with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived support. 
The reliability of the overall scale and the subscales was good, with Cron- 
bach’s alpha ranging from .90 to .94. 
Demographic characteristics. During the baseline survey, mothers’ demo- 
graphic characteristics were recorded. These variables included their age, 
highest education attainment, employment status, marital status, monthly 
household income, whether they had any chronic health conditions (e.g., dia- 
betes mellitus, heart disease, cancer, etc.), and whether they were receiving 
social security assistance from the government. 

In this study, all statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 24.0 using a 
significance level of 0.05. The demographic characteristics, as well as the 
pregnancy intention, of the mothers were summarized using descriptive sta- 
tistics. The demographic characteristics were then compared between the two 
groups with intended pregnancy and unintended pregnancy using chi-square 
tests and t tests. The mean scores of the scales assessing depression, anxiety, 
stress level, HRQoL, and social support were summarized by descriptive sta- 
tistics and compared between the two groups using t tests. However, the pro- 
portions of mothers with CEPDS scores higher than the cutoff of 10, the 
proportion of mothers reporting IPV, and the proportion of fathers being 


involved during the pregnancy and after childbirth were compared between 
groups using the chi-square tests. 
To examine the associations between unintended pregnancy and PND and 
the effects of father involvement, IPV during pregnancy, and social support on 
those associations, a series of multiphase logistic regression analyses with the 
proportion of mothers with PND (i.e., with CEPDS score higher than 10) as the 
dependent variable were conducted. In the multiphase logistic regression mod- 
els, it was hypothesized that the variables in early phases would affect those in 
later phases, but not the vice versa. In Phase 1, a forward stepwise logistic 
regression was conducted with all demographic characteristics as independent 
variables. In Phase 2, pregnancy intention, IPV during pregnancy, and fear 
resulted from IPV were entered as independent variables. In Phase 3, the differ- 
ent types of father involvement were included in the forward stepwise regres- 
sion model; while in Phase 4, perceived social support was included as the 
independent variable. In this study, the Hosmer and Lemeshow (H-L) Test was 
used to assess the goodness of fit of the logistic regression models (Hosmer & 
Lemeshow, 2000). A nonsignificant result implied adequacy of the model. 


In this study, a total of 1,737 eligible pregnant women agreed to participate 
and completed the baseline survey, and 1,083 of them remained and com- 
pleted the follow-up survey, resulting in a retention rate of 62.3%. 
Demographic characteristics, antenatal depression, anxiety, stress, HRQoL, 
fear, IPV physical assault, and sexual coercion by their partner during preg- 
nancy were compared between those who completed both surveys and those 
who completed only the baseline survey, and no statistically significant dif- 
ference was found. The only difference is on IPV psychological aggression 
during pregnancy. Those who completed only the baseline survey reported 
6% psychological aggression during pregnancy, but those who completed 
both surveys reported 14%. It does not seem that IPV psychological aggres- 
sion had impact on the attrition. 
Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the final sample. In 
this sample, mothers with unintended pregnancy comprised 16.4% (n = 178). 
The mean age of the overall sample was 31.3 years (SD = 4.6 years). 
Approximately 78.8% were employed as full-time workers and 93.7% were 
married or cohabiting with their partner during the study period. Between-group 
comparisons were conducted between mothers with intended pregnancy and 
those with unintended pregnancy, and no significant difference was found in any 
of these demographic characteristics (all p > .05).

the IPV incidents. The mean scores of SF-12 were 50.35 (SD = 6.31) for 
PCS and 52.27 (SD = 8.00) for MCS, while that of MSPSS-C was 71.51 
(SD = 10.69) overall. 
Significant differences were observed between the mothers with intended 
pregnancy and those with unintended pregnancy. When compared to those 
with intended pregnancy, mothers with unintended pregnancy reported sig- 
nificantly higher level of PND symptoms (p < .05), lower degree of father 
involvement during pregnancy and after childbirth (all p < .001), greater like- 
lihood of experiencing IPV (p < .01) and fear resulted from IPV (p < .05), 
higher level of postnatal stress, and lower degree of perceived social support 
from family, friends, and significant others (all p < .05). 
Table 3 lists the proportion of mothers who reported a CEPDS score higher 
than the cutoff of 10 in this study. Overall, 26.4% of the mothers could be 
identified as having antenatal depression and 9.3% as having PND. Significant 
between-group difference was observed in PND: significantly a greater pro- 
portion of mothers with unintended pregnancy could be identified as having 
PND than their counterparts (16.9% vs. 7.8%, p < .01). 
Table 4 shows Pearson’s correlation of all the variables used in the 
regression analysis, except those categorical variables. Table 5 shows the 
summary of the results of the multiphase logistic regression analyses. In 
Phase 1, none of the demographic characteristics was significantly associ- 
ated with PND (which was operationalized a CEPDS score over the cutoff 
of 10). In Phase 2, unintended pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.19, 
95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.36, 3.55], p < .01), IPV during pregnancy 



















 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 


(aOR = 1.78, 95% CI = [1.04, 3.03], p < .05), and fear (aOR = 3.10, 95% CI 
= [1.38, 6.97], p < .01) were significantly associated with PND, while after 
father involvement was included in Phase 3, only unintended pregnancy 
(aOR = 1.97, 95% CI [1.18, 3.28], p <.01), fear (aOR = 2.88, 95% CI [1.25, 
6.64], p <.05), and fathers’ emotional support (aOR = 0.58, 95% CI = [0.41, 
0.83], p <.01) were significant factors. Finally, in Phase 4, when social sup- 
port was added to the regression model, only unintended pregnancy 
remained as significant risk factor for PND (aOR = 1.95, 95% CI = [1.15, 
3.28], p < .05), while fathers’ emotional support (aOR = 0.68, 95% CI = 
[0.46, 0.99], p < .05) and social support (aOR = 0.95, 95% CI = [0.93, 0.97], 
p < .001) were two significant protective factors for PND. The final model 
accounted for 16.7% of variance of PND measured 4 weeks postpartum. 


The findings of this study show that unintended pregnancy was the major risk 
factor that increased almost twice of the PND risk among mothers after the 
adjustment of other variables, supporting the link found in previous meta- 
analysis in literature (Abajobir et al., 2016). Fathers’ emotional support and 
social support from family, friends, and significant others, however, were two 
protective factors for PND among the Chinese mothers. When father involve- 
ment was included, the previously significant effect of IPV and fear resulted 
from IPV incidents on PND became nonsignificant, implying the possible 
effect of father involvement on reducing the negative effects of IPV on mater- 
nal PND. 
This study also reveals reliable estimates on the rates of unintended preg- 
nancy and PND. Approximately 16% of the mothers in Hong Kong reported 
unintended pregnancy, and this rate falls into the range 9% to 25% found in 
previous studies in Hong Kong (C. Y. Chan et al., 2013; Koh et al., 2014); 
although it is not comparable to the rates found in previous Western studies 
(e.g., 45% in a national survey in the United States; Finer & Zolna, 2016). As 
for maternal PND, the 9% rate found in this study falls into the lower end of 
the range of 9% to 22% observed in a Chinese study which used the same 
cutoff of CEPDS (Leung et al., 2011). 

The positive association between unintended pregnancy and PND is sup- 
ported in this study, providing convergent evidence to the past findings that 


PND is more likely to among mothers with unintended pregnancy found both 
in Western countries and in Asian countries (Abajobir et al., 2016; Abbasi 
et al., 2013; Ahmad et al., 2018; Brito et al., 2015; Chi, Zhang, Wu, & Wang, 
2016). Although some have suggested the possible effects of antenatal 
depression on this association (Abbasi et al., 2013), the current findings indi- 
cate that neither antenatal depression was more likely among mothers with 
unintended pregnancy, nor antenatal depression could significantly increase 
the risk of PND at 4 weeks postpartum. Instead, unintended pregnancy was 
independently linked to PND, even after the adjustment for other factors, 
providing support to the independent effect of unintended pregnancy among 
the mixed findings in literature (Abbasi et al., 2013; Brito et al., 2015). 
The current findings demonstrate that mothers with unintended pregnancy 
were more likely to experience IPV during pregnancy, and those experiences 
might be linked to greater risk of PND. This extends the existing knowledge 
that unintended pregnancy increases the risk of IPV (Wang et al., 2017) and 
that IPV increases the risk of PND (Adamu & Adinew, 2018; Ali, Ali, & 
Azam, 2009; Desmarais, Pritchard, Lowder, & Janssen, 2014), by showing 
the potential role of IPV in the positive association between unintended preg- 
nancy and PND. Researchers have suggested the possible impact of IPV dur- 
ing pregnancy on the emotional health among mothers. For example, it might 
increase the risk of negative health behaviors and mood disorders and in turn 
increase the risk of PND (Walsh et al., 2015). Among the negative impacts 
aroused by IPV, fear might be one major negative emotion that could be 
linked to both IPV and depression or PND (Crempien et al., 2011). Indeed, 
this study demonstrated that fear resulted from IPV played a significant role 
in increasing the risk of PND, indicating that fear related to IPV might be one 
underlying factor in explaining PND among mother victims. 
Father involvement, in the form of emotional support to the mothers, 
was found to reduce the risk of maternal PND. It was shown that when 
fathers’ emotional support was included, the previously significant effects 
of pregnancy IPV and fear on PND became nonsignificant, indicating the 
potential effectiveness of fathers’ support on reducing the negative health 
consequences related to pregnancy IPV. On one hand, the protective effect 
of fathers’ emotional support may directly reduce the negative emotions 
and mood problems of mothers, lowering the risk of the onset of PND. On 
the other hand, father involvement may have indirect effect on PND. It has 
been suggested that involved fathers may be better prepared for fatherhood 
(K. L. Chan et al., 2017), which reduces the likelihood of conflicts between 
the couples due to pregnancy and child care and in turn increases marital 
satisfaction (Galovan, Holmes, Schramm, & Lee, 2013), an important pro- 
tective factor for both IPV and maternal PND (Adamu & Adinew, 2018; 


Stith, Green, Smith, & Ward, 2008). It is noteworthy that fathers’ emotional 
support remained as a significant protective factor even when more general 
social support was included in the model, demonstrating that fathers’ sup- 
port could stand out as an independent source of protection against PND 
among mothers. 

The major strength of this study is the inclusion of father involvement in the 
associations between unintended pregnancy and maternal PND. Although 
there has been emerging evidence that father involvement may promote 
maternal health (K. L. Chan et al., 2017; Gungor & Beji, 2007; Liamputtong 
& Naksook, 2003), solid empirical evidence from large-scale studies, espe- 
cially Asian studies, has been scarce. This study provides important evidence 
supporting the effectiveness of father involvement in reducing the negative 
consequences of unintended pregnancy on maternal PND. 
Another strength of this study is the comprehensive operationalization of 
father involvement, which has been varying greatly across studies (Gungor & 
Beji, 2007; Liamputtong & Naksook, 2003). This study examines the concept 
by including various aspects of father involvement before and after childbirth. 
Aspects such as instrumental support, emotional support, and the involvement 
in education classes were all covered. Findings would shed important lights on 
the operationalization of father involvement in future studies. 
Despite the above strengths of this study, there were some methodologi- 
cal limitations. This study only measured PND at about 4 weeks postpar- 
tum. Within this time frame, some PND cases might be undetected, since 
the onset of PND may be beyond the 4 weeks of postpartum (Kettunen, 
Koistinen, & Hintikka, 2014). Besides, the inclusion of only four out of 
eight public hospitals might impose limitation on the representativeness of 
the findings. Without the coverage of all hospitals in the city, the represen- 
tativeness would not be able to reach the maximum. In addition, this study 
did not include all potential factors in explaining PND. For example, health 
of newborns and marital satisfaction might be some examples of the pos- 
sible factors that could be associated with unintended pregnancy and PND 
(McPeak et al., 2015; Odinka et al., 2018). Future research may consider 
including more variables, such as health of other family members and pre- 
vious history of depression and anxiety of the mothers, in developing the 
model to explain maternal PND. Another limitation is that the measures of 
father involvement and PND were based on mother’s self-report. Father 
may have different perception of involvement in terms of instrumental or 
emotional support (K. L. Chan et al., 2017). Including father’s report of 


involvement might provide different perspective in understanding the pro- 
tective effect of father involvement. Self-report on PND using CEPDS is 
not for the determination of clinical depression. Medical professional’s 
diagnosis would be required to provide more comprehensive assessment of 
PND, types, and severity of abuses as well. 

This study shows that unintended pregnancy increases the risk of maternal 
PND assessed 4 weeks postpartum. This positive association is robust and 
remains significant after the adjustment of potential confounding and associ- 
ated factors. Results also support that IPV and the related fear during preg- 
nancy could be a risk factor of maternal PND, but the strength of these 
associations would be reduced with increased levels of emotional support 
provided by fathers. This highlights the importance of promoting father 
involvement during pregnancy and after childbirth to benefit maternal health 
and provides insights on the need for concerted efforts from relevant institu- 
tions to enable fathers to be available for being involved in pregnancy, child- 
birth, and child care and, more importantly, to neither accept nor inadvertently 
create barriers to that involvement.
