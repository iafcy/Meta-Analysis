Do Pregnancy Intentions Matter? A Research Note 
Revisiting Relationships Among Pregnancy, Birth, 
and Maternal Outcomes 

ABSTRACT The pre ven tion of unplanned or unin tended preg nan cies con tin ues to be a 
cor ner stone of U.S. repro duc tive health pol icy, but the evi dence that such preg nan cies 
cause adverse mater nal and child out comes is lim ited. In this research note, we exam­ 
ine these rela tion ships using recent large­scale data and inverse pro pen sity weights 
esti­mated­from­gen­er­al­ized­boosted­mod­els.­We­find­that­preg­nancy­tim­ing­is­related­ 
to mater nal expe ri ence dur ing preg nancy, but not to infant out comes at birth—both of 
which are con sis tent with prior research. In an addi tion to the lit er a ture, we show that 
preg nancy tim ing is rel e vant for a num ber of mater nal out comes, such as the onset of 
depres sion and inti mate part ner vio lence, changes in smok ing behav ior, and receipt of 
med­i­cal­care.­These­find­ings­sug­gest­that­pol­icy­intended­to­improve­infant­wel­fare­by­ 
pre vent ing unin tended preg nan cies has lit tle empir i cal sup port, but that pol icy focused 
on increas ing repro duc tive auton omy and mater nal well­being has the poten tial to 
improve out comes. 


Preventing unin tended or unplanned preg nan cies has long been a cor ner stone of U.S. 
repro duc tive health pol icy, par tially because infant and mater nal out comes are bet ter 
after a planned ver sus an unplanned preg nancy (Brown and Eisenberg 1995; Gipson 
et al. 2008; Institute of Medicine 2011). These well­established asso ci a tions helped 
jus tify expanded con tra cep tive insur ance cov er age in the 2010 Affordable Care Act 
(Institute of Medicine 2011). 
Despite­its­impor­tant­influ­ence­in­pol­icy­mak­ing,­preg­nancy­inten­tion—its­rela­ 
tion ship to out comes, mea sure ment, and con cep tual value—has long been the sub­ 
ject of debate (Aiken et al. 2016; Kost and Lindberg 2015; Kost and Zolna 2019; 
Luker 1999; Potter et al. 2019; Trussell et al. 1999). Unintended preg nan cies have 
been asso ci ated with neg a tive fam ily and child out comes, even after con trol ling for 
mater nal char ac ter is tics within a mul ti ple regres sion frame work (Cheng et al. 2009;

-9710311)con tains sup ple men tary mate rial. 
 





Joyce et al. 2000; Kost et al. 1998; Weller et al. 1987).1 However, other stud ies have 
found almost no causal rela tion ship between preg nancy inten tions and preg nancy or 
infant out comes at birth (Joyce et al. 2000; Kost and Lindberg 2015). We make two 
con tri bu tions to this debate. 
First, we revisit the ques tion of whether infants fare bet ter when the preg nancy 
was well­timed using a larger sam ple and with more pre cise mea sures and meth ods 
than prior work. We aim to deter mine whether the asso ci a tion between preg nancy 
tim ing (for preg nan cies taken to term) and adverse out comes is due solely to mater­ 
nal char ac ter is tics that are cor re lated with preg nancy tim ing or whether preg nancy 
tim ing inde pen dently exerts a causal effect on out comes. It is worth not ing here, 
although we con sider it more in the fol low ing, that we use the tra di tional sur vey ques­ 
tion about whether the preg nancy occurred when the woman wanted it to. Typically, 
this­ques­tion­has­been­used­to­mea­sure­inten­tions.­In­light­of­sig­nifi­­cant­cri­tiques­of­ 
this operationalization, we instead use the lan guage of tim ing. 
Second, we expand the scope of out comes to include a range of mater nal preg nancy 
and post par tum out comes. Much prior work addressed only infant out comes at birth, 
child out comes, or mater nal out comes directly affect ing the in utero envi ron ment, such 
as mater nal alco hol or tobacco con sump tion (Gipson et al. 2008). Research has found 
links between preg nancy inten tion and the expe ri ence of inti mate part ner vio lence 
(IPV) (Jasinski 2001) and post par tum depres sion (Abajobir et al. 2016; Abbasi et al. 
2013; Fellenzer and Cibula 2014; Mercier et al. 2013; but see Christensen et al. 2011), 
as well as symp toms of anx i ety and stress later in life (Biggs et al. 2017; Herd et al. 
2016), suggesting that mater nal out comes may be related to preg nancy inten tions. 

We ana lyze data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), an 
annual sur vey admin is tered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state 
health­depart­ments­of­a­strat­i­fied­sam­ple­of­indi­vid­u­als­who­have­recently­given­birth;­ 
respon dents are contacted within 2–4 months of the live birth. Survey data are inte grated 
with­birth­cer­tifi­­cate­data,­which­are­the­source­of­many­crit­i­cal­infant­out­comes­at­birth,­ 
such as birth weight and pre term birth. We use Phase 7 data from 2012–2015, rep re sen­ 
ta tive of births in par tici pat ing states and 83% of births in the United States. 
The PRAMS ques tion naire employs the tra di tional ques tion to mea sure preg nancy 
inten tion: “Thinking back to just before you got preg nant with your new baby, how did 
you­feel­about­becom­ing­preg­nant?”­Respondents­choose­one­of­five­response­options:­ 
“I wanted to be preg nant later,” “I wanted to be preg nant sooner,” “I wanted to be 
preg nant then,” “I didn’t want to be preg nant then or at any time in the future,” and “I 
wasn’t sure what I wanted.” If moth ers reported that they wanted to be preg nant later, 
the extent of mistiming was assessed with this fol low­up ques tion: “How much lon ger 
did you want to wait to become preg nant?” Response options were “less than 1 year,” 
1 People of all gen ders give birth. In the United States, most extant data sets include char ac ter iza tion 
by gen der but assume that it cor re sponds to sex assigned at birth, and thus it is unclear whether men (or 
other gen ders) with a uterus pro vided infor ma tion about births. For par si mony, we use female nouns and 
pro nouns. 


“1 year to less than 2 years,” “2 years to less than 3 years,” “3 years to 5 years,” and 
“more than 5 years.” We divide these responses into two groups: whether preg nan cies 
were ear lier than wanted by less than two years and whether they were ear lier than 
wanted by two years or more. In Phase 7, PRAMS had added a new response option—“I 
wasn’t sure what I wanted.” Comparisons between Phases 7 and 6 indi cate that respon­ 
dents who selected this option were drawn from all of the other options except “I wanted 
to be preg nant then,” suggesting that this choice is dis tinct from the other three choices 
(Maddow­Zimet and Kost 2020);­there­fore,­ we­ include­ “unsure”­ as­ a­ fifth­ inten­tion­ 
cate gory. Our results are thus not strictly com pa ra ble to ana ly ses employing a four­ 
 
cat e gory mea sure of preg nancy inten tions, but they may have greater con cep tual validity. 
We, like oth ers, ques tion the inter pre ta tion of this ques tion as cap tur ing “inten tions” 
(Kost and Zolna 2019; Potter et al. 2019; Santelli et al. 2003). This con cern is borne 
out of both con cep tual and mea sure ment issues. The con se quences are con sid er able: 
unin tended births can be con strued as an inabil ity or unwill ing ness to plan, a vio la­ 
tion of Amer i cans’ notion of a respon si ble adult (Shim 2010). Therefore, rather than 
using the tra di tional lan guage of “intended” and “unin tended,” we hew more closely to 
the data in describ ing preg nan cies as “then/sooner,” “wanted <2 years later,” “wanted 
≥2 years later,” “never/unwanted,” and “unsure.” We also share con cerns that par ents 
revise preg nancy tim ing pref er ences over the course of the preg nancy and in light of 
infant well­being, leav ing a ret ro spec tive self­report vul ner a ble to mea sure ment error. 
While typ i cally reports shift from unin tended to intended, some stud ies have shown the 
reverse (Guzzo and Hayford 2014; Joyce et al. 2002; Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1993; 
Westoff and Ryder 1977). Revision is par tic u larly likely when the infant expe ri ences 
adverse health events, which is discussed in more detail in the fol low ing. 
All depen dent var i ables and sam ple sizes are listed in Table 1.2 Each out come is 
binary (yes/no). Pregnancy out comes include when the mother rec og nized her preg­ 
nancy­and­whether­she­received­pre­na­tal­care­within­the­first­tri­mes­ter,­gained­the­ 
recommended­weight­dur­ing­preg­nancy­as­defined­by­the­Amer­i­can­College­of­Obste­ 
tricians and Gynecologists (2013), engaged in smok ing or drink ing dur ing preg nancy, 
or expe ri enced the onset of IPV dur ing preg nancy. Infant out comes at birth include 
whether the birth was pre term and whether the new born was low (<2,500 g) or very 
low (<1,500 g) birth weight, was small for ges ta tional age, was admit ted to the inten­ 
sive care unit (ICU), or died before age 1. Maternal post par tum out comes include 
moth ers’ reports of ever breastfeeding or breastfeeding for at least three months, 
attend ing a post par tum med i cal visit, and changes in depres sion or smok ing. 
PRAMS data are col lected from birthing par ents who recently had a live birth and 
exclude those whose preg nan cies ended in mis car riage, abor tion, or still birth. We 
can not assess whether mater nal well­being dur ing and after these preg nan cies var­ 
ied by preg nancy tim ing for those excluded pop u la tions. Because access to abor tion 
dif fers by state of res i dence and eco nomic and social priv i lege, selec tion into unin­ 
tended birth is non ran dom. Our data are con di tional on this selec tion pro cess. Our 
ana ly ses com pare moth ers who reported that their preg nan cies were well­timed with 
oth er wise sim i lar moth ers who reported that their preg nan cies were mistimed, but we 
can not say whether these same moth ers would have taken their preg nan cies to term if 
abor tion had been more read ily avail able.

Notes: Data on preg nancy, infant, and mater nal out comes are from Phase 7 of the National PRAMS. The 
num ber of obser va tions in the uni verse of data varies because of var i a tion in response rates by ques tion. 
IPV = inti mate part ner vio lence. 
The inde pen dent var i ables include a num ber of the mother’s char ac ter is tics: age 
(≤19, 20–24, 25–29, ≥30), mar i tal sta tus (mar ried or other), race and eth nic ity (non­ 
His panic White, His panic, non­His panic Black, non­His panic other), edu ca tional 
attain ment (less than high school, high school, some col lege, col lege or more), expe­

We use inverse pro pen sity weighting (IPW) to adjust the dis tri bu tion of mater nal 
char ac ter is tics so that preg nancy tim ing groups are sim i lar with respect to observed 
var i ables that are (1) related to the prob a bil ity of assign ment to a preg nancy tim ing

ing that all con found ers are adjusted for, regressing preg nancy tim ing on the out come 
of inter est pro vi des unbi ased esti ma tes of the mar ginal causal effect of preg nancy 
tim ing (Austin and Stu art 2015; Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983). Because we can not

not be interpreted as unbi ased esti ma tes. Nevertheless, we can adjust for many of the 
major­fac­tors­that­influ­ence­preg­nancy­tim­ing. 
We use gen er al ized boosted mod els to esti mate mul ti no mial pro pen sity weights 
(McCaffrey et al. 2013). The pre dic tors we use are mother’s age, mar i tal sta tus, race 
and eth nic ity, edu ca tion, and state of res i dence, as well as birth order and whether 
Med ic aid paid for pre na tal care.3 After the pro pen sity weights are esti mated, they are 
mul ti plied by the sur vey weights to per mit cal cu la tion of aver age treat ment effects 
that are rep re sen ta tive of the PRAMS pop u la tion.

As expected, moth ers who wanted their preg nan cies then, sooner, or later but within 
two years were advan taged com pared with moth ers in the three other groups (Table 
2): they had more years of edu ca tion, were more likely to be mar ried, and were less 
likely to have had their pre na tal care paid by Med ic aid. Table 2 also shows that 
they were more likely to expe ri ence adverse preg nancy, birth, and post par tum out­ 
comes. Disentangling these cor re la tions requires adjusting for dif fer ences in moth ers’ 
char ac ter is tics.

women who wanted to be preg nant two or more years later, did not want to be preg­ 
nant, or were unsure how they felt were much more likely than the ref er ence group to 
expe ri ence the onset of inti mate part ner vio lence dur ing preg nancy. 
Despite these dif fer ences in mater nal expe ri ence dur ing preg nancy by preg nancy 
tim ing, infants’ health at birth was quite sim i lar after pro pen sity weighting (Figure 2). 
The­sign­and­the­mag­ni­tude­of­the­coef­fi­cients­var­ied­across­out­comes,­and­few­were­ 
sig­nifi­­cantly­ dif­fer­ent­ from­ zero.­ Of­ note,­ how­ever,­ is­ the­ result­ that­ chil­dren­ who­ 
were born from unwanted preg nan cies were sub stan tially less likely to die in their 
first­year­than­those­born­from­wanted­preg­nan­cies.­Given­the­rar­ity­of­this­out­come­ 
and the poten tial for selec tive reporting and revi sion (Smith­Greenaway and Sennott 
2016),­we­are­hes­i­tant­to­draw­firm­con­clu­sions,­but­the­direc­tion,­mag­ni­tude,­and­ 
pre ci sion of the esti mate suggest that unwanted births are at least as likely to result 
in infant mor tal ity than wanted births. In sum, preg nancy tim ing may have affected 
mater nal expe ri ence dur ing preg nancy, but did not mea sur ably impact infant health 
in utero. 
Results for mater nal post par tum out comes are shown in Figure 3. Women whose 
preg nan cies were unwanted or arrived more than two years ear lier than wanted and 
those who were unsure how they felt about their preg nancy fared unam big u ously 
worse than women whose preg nan cies were bet ter timed, even after weighting. 
Among women who were depressed prior to preg nancy, those with unwanted births, 
those who were unsure how they felt about their preg nancy, and those whose preg­ 
nan cies occurred more than two years before they wanted to be preg nant were less 
likely than the ref er ence group to expe ri ence relief from their depres sion. Women in 
these three categories who did not report depres sion prior to preg nancy were more 
likely to become depressed after giv ing birth. They were less likely to report hav ing 
reduced or quit smok ing and were equally likely to report hav ing increased smok ing. 
Further, women whose preg nan cies were unwanted or who were unsure how they felt 
about their preg nancy were less likely to attend a post par tum checkup.

PRAMS. See the online Appendix Section 1 for details on estimation of the propensity­weighted model. 
Odds ratios and standard errors are given in Appendix Section 3, Table 1. IPV = intimate partner violence. 



Fig. 2 Unadjusted and inverse propensity­weighted estimates of associations between pregnancy inten­ 
tions and infant outcomes at birth, giving odds ratios relative to pregnancies that were wanted then or 
sooner. Scales on the x­axes vary. Models include all respondents. Data are from Phase 7 of the National 
PRAMS. See the online Appendix Section 1 for details on estimation of the propensity­weighted model. 
Odds ratios and standard errors are given in Appendix Section 3, Table 2. ICU = intensive care unit. 
Women whose preg nan cies were ear lier than they wanted were as likely as other 
moth ers to have ever breastfed or to have breastfed for at least three months. Those 
whose preg nan cies were unwanted or who were unsure about their preg nancy were 
less likely to have ever breastfed or to have breastfed for at least three months. These 
results­com­ple­ment­find­ings­from­Kost­and­Lindberg­(2015), who found sim i lar rela­ 
tion ships only for preg nan cies that were unwanted. Our results reveal that mean ing ful 
rela tion ships with breastfeeding extend beyond preg nan cies that were unwanted to 
those about which the mother felt unsure. 
In sum, after account ing for poten tial con found ers, preg nancy tim ing was not 
asso ci ated with infant out comes at birth, but women whose preg nan cies arrived 
sooner than they wanted had worse post par tum out comes than those whose preg nan­ 
cies were on time or arrived later than they wanted. Women who had preg nan cies 
that were unwanted or were mark edly ear lier than wanted, and women who were 
unsure about their preg nancy, suf fered numer ous del e te ri ous out comes and behav­ 
iors, includ ing IPV, depres sion, tobacco con sump tion, lack of early pre na tal care, and 
lack of post par tum care. 

Fig. 3 Unadjusted and inverse propensity­weighted estimates of associations between pregnancy inten­ 
tions and postpartum outcomes, giving odds ratios relative to pregnancies that were wanted then or sooner. 
Scales on the x­axes vary. The postpartum visit and ever breastfed models include all respondents; the 
depression initiated model includes respondents reporting no depression prior to pregnancy; the depression 
improved model includes respondents reporting depression prior to pregnancy; the smoking worsened 
model includes respondents reporting smoking <41 cigarettes/day three months before pregnancy; the 
smoking improved model includes respondents reporting tobacco use three months before pregnancy; and 
the breastfed for ≥3 months model includes respondents interviewed at least 91 days after birth. Data are 
from Phase 7 of the National PRAMS. See the online Appendix Section 1 for details on estimation of the 
propensity­weighted model. Odds ratios and standard errors are given in Appendix Section 3, Table 3. 




One­ jus­ti­fi­ca­tion­ for­ pub­lic­ pol­icy­ encour­ag­ing­ planned­ or­ intended­ preg­nan­cies,­ 
how­ever­ defined,­ is­ that­ intended­ preg­nan­cies­ are­ bet­ter­ for­ infants.­ Like­ pre­vi­ous­ 
research­ers,­ we­ find­ that­ this­ is­ unsup­ported­ by­ the­ data.­ By­ con­trast,­ our­ results­ 
high light that preg nancy tim ing likely does mat ter for mater nal out comes. We show 
that women who wanted to be preg nant later, did not want to be preg nant at all , or 
were unsure about the best tim ing for their preg nancy were at higher risk of inti mate 
part ner vio lence and post par tum depres sion. Unwanted preg nan cies and preg nan cies 
about which the mother was unsure were also asso ci ated with lower rates of breast­ 
feeding. These results are con sis tent with work show ing that mistimed preg nan cies 
taken to term may have neg a tive impacts on older chil dren in the fam ily, in par tic­ 
u lar through changes in home envi ron ments and par ents’ cog ni tive and emo tional 
resources (Barber et al. 1999; Barber and East 2009, 2011). Given that the preg nancy 
tim ing ques tion was asked ret ro spec tively, it is pos si ble that these rela tion ships are 
due to ex post revi sion in light of adverse events. Such revi sion is known to occur for 
infant out comes (Smith­Greenaway and Sennott 2016), but more research is needed 
to under stand their rela tion ships with mater nal out comes. 
To mit i gate any neg a tive effects of unwanted or mistimed preg nan cies on mater­ 
nal out comes, repro duc tive health pol icy should be recentered around repro duc tive 
auton omy and should include pol i cies such as uni ver sal access to no­cost con tra cep­ 
tion and abor tion, com pre hen sive sex edu ca tion, and equity in repro duc tive health 
care, with par tic u lar atten tion to mater nal risks. Women who express that a preg nancy 
was “unwanted” or “mistimed” are tell ing us that they would have pre ferred not to 
have become preg nant at that time. Effective pol icy would work with, rather than 
attempt­to­change,­these­pref­er­ences.­■
