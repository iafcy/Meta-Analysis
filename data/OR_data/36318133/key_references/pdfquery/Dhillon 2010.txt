Abstract 
Objective: to identify the prevalence of antenatal depression among Asian women living in the UK in one antenatal 
clinic, and to investigate the possible association with a desire for a male child and other risk factors. 
Design: cross-sectional questionnaire-based study. 
Setting: general antenatal clinic in a hospital in Birmingham. 
Participants: 300 Asian women, irrespective of place of birth. 
Methods: consecutive Asian women attending routine antenatal appointments during the study period self-completed 
a questionnaire. The ﬁrst part investigated socio-demographic, cultural and other possible risk factors, including 
gender preference. The second part comprised the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). 
Measurements: EPDS score greater than or equal to 12 indicating probable depression. 
Findings: the prevalence of depression was 30.7% (92/300, 95% conﬁdence interval 25.4–35.9%). Maternal male gender 
preference was not common and was not associated with antenatal depression. Family male gender preference, 
unplanned pregnancy, a history of depression and feeling anxious in pregnancy were independently associated with an 
increased likelihood of depression, whilst support from family and friends, being satisﬁed with pregnancy and being 
multiparous were associated with a reduced likelihood of depression. 
Conclusion: rates of antenatal depression were very high in Asian women with some associated risk factors. However, 
male gender preference was not associated with antenatal depression. 
Implications for practice: given the high prevalence, screening Asian women for depression may be indicated to allow 
treatment.

Depression is a common disorder globally and a 
major cause of disability (World Health Organiza- 
tion, 2006). It is known that depression is more 
common in women than men across many cultures, 
and its ﬁrst onset often occurs during the child- 
bearing years (Weissman and Olfson, 1995). In 
the developed world, postnatal depression has 
been the subject of many investigations and its

prevalence is estimated to be 10–15% (O’Hara and 
Swain, 1996). The negative and ongoing impacts of 
postnatal depression, physically, cognitively and 
socially on infant development, have been well 
documented (Beck, 1998; Patel et al., 2004; Rah- 
man et al., 2007). Children with mothers who have 
postnatal depression have a higher rate of insecure 
attachments and perform poorly in cognitive tasks 
(Cogill et al., 1986; Murray, 1992; Murray et al., 
1996). 
Antenatal depression, generally deﬁned as the 
onset of depressive symptoms during pregnancy, 
can occur at any gestation (Bennett et al., 2004). 
Less information is available on antenatal depres- 
sion but studies have generally demonstrated a 
prevalence of 9–17% (Evans et al., 2001; Joseffsson 
et al., 2001; Heron et al., 2004). Antenatal 
depression has important implications for fetal 
and maternal health. Women with antenatal 
depression or anxiety have been found to have 
more planned caesarean sections and epidural use 
in labour (Andersson et al., 2004), to be at a higher 
risk of pre-eclampsia (Kurki et al., 2000), and to be 
more likely to deliver preterm and have low-birth 
weight infants (Steer et al., 1992; Hedegaard et 
al., 1993). Furthermore, antenatal depression is 
associated with postnatal depression (Cooper et 
al., 1996; Forman et al., 2000). 
Although research has been conducted on an- 
tenatal and postnatal depression in Asian countries, 
few studies have examined antenatal depression 
among Asian women living in Western countries. 
High rates of postnatal depression (28%) have been 
reported in Pakistani women (Rahman et al., 2003), 
with rates of 11–23% in Indian women (Chandran et 
al., 2002; Patel et al., 2002). Information on 
antenatal depression from the developing world is 
more limited, but one study in India found a 
prevalence of 16% (Chandran et al., 2002) and 
another study in Pakistan found a prevalence of 25% 
(Rahman and Creed, 2007). 
Gender preference, meaning a desire for a male 
child, exists in many cultures in South Asia, the 
Middle East and East Asia (Booth et al., 1994; 
Nielsen et al., 1997; Chandran et al., 2002; Patel et 
al., 2002; Ekuklu et al., 2004; Lofstedt et al., 
2004). This can be illustrated by the example of 
female 
India, where sex-selected abortions of 
fetuses are believed to have contributed to the 
unequal male-to-female ratio (Booth et al., 1994; 
Nielsen et al., 1997; Sharma et al., 2007). In these 
societies, the birth of a female child when a male 
child is desired has been found to be associated 
with postnatal depression (Ghubash and Abou- 
Saleh, 1997; Chandran et al., 2002; Patel et al., 
2002; Rahman et al., 2003; Ekuklu et al., 2004). 
The aim of this study was to identify the 
prevalence of antenatal depression among Asian 
women living in the UK in one antenatal clinic, and 
to investigate the possible association with a desire 
for a male child and other risk factors. 

The study was cross-sectional, conducted at a large 
maternity hospital in Birmingham, UK. Birmingham 
is a diverse city with 66% of the population 
identifying themselves as White British compared 
with the 87% national average (Population Census 
Data, 2001). The Asian ethnic groups in Birmingham 
include Pakistani (10.6%), Indian (5.7%), Banglade- 
shi (2.1%) and other Asian (1.0%) (Population Census 
Data, 2001). Eighty-four per cent of Birmingham 
residents are born in the UK (Population Census 
Data, 2001). 
Women of Asian ethnicity were recruited from 
general antenatal appointments from January to 
April 2007. Asian ethnicity was deﬁned as Pakistani, 
Bangladeshi or Indian descent, irrespective of place 
of birth. Other Asian ethnicities were excluded as 
they constitute only a small percentage of the 
Birmingham population (Population Census Data, 
2001). All women recognised to be Asian, either 
from names on the clinic list or their appearance, 
were asked if they were able to speak and read 
English and then asked if they would participate. 
Although this study focused on Indian, Pakistani and 
Bangladeshi women, within these areas, many 
different languages are spoken. It was not possible 
to obtain translators for all the different languages, 
so women unable to speak English could not be 
included in the study. Ethical approval was received 
from the South Birmingham Ethics Committee. 
After written informed consent, women were 
given an anonymous two-part questionnaire to 
complete. The ﬁrst part included questions on risk 
factors identiﬁed in previous studies, in particular 
the questionnaire used by Patel et al. (2002) in 
their study in Goa, India. Data were sought about 
socio-demographic characteristics (age, household, 
ethnicity, country of birth, marital status, employ- 
ment) and about topics such as social support from 
husband, family and friends and the quality of 
support. Data were recorded on present pregnancy 
(number of weeks of gestation, unplanned preg- 
nancy, satisfaction with pregnancy) and previous 
pregnancy such as number of other children and 
their gender. Data about present and previous 
psychological illness, speciﬁcally previous antena- 
tal depression, previous postnatal depression and 



feeling anxious 
in pregnancy, and information 
regarding gender preference were also collected. 
The second part of the questionnaire comprised the 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) to 
identify women with probable antenatal depression 
(Cox et al., 1987; Murray and Cox, 1990). This 10- 
item self-complete scale was developed to screen 
for postnatal depression but has been validated for 
use in pregnancy and for use around the world 
(Green and Murray, 1994; Ebehard-Gran et al., 
2002). The scale ranges from 0 to 30 and a cut-off 
score of greater than or equal to 12 was used to 
identify probable cases of depression, as recom- 
mended by a validation study in pregnancy, to 
include all women with both major and minor 
depression (Murray and Cox, 1990). 
The questionnaire was self-completed with the 
researcher present if clariﬁcation was required. 
Women could return questionnaires directly to the 
researcher or to a box at the clinic reception to 
maintain anonymity. A pilot study of 50 subjects 
demonstrated that women had adequate levels of 
in completing the 
literacy and were conﬁdent 
questionnaire. Some struggled with the meaning of 
gender when answering on gender preference, so this 
was changed to preference for the sex of the child. 
The question was phrased so that women were asked 
‘what sex do you want your child to be?’ and could 
answer one of male, female or do not mind. 
Data were analysed using Statistical Package for 
the Social Sciences version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chica- 
go, IL, USA) with two-tailed signiﬁcance levels of 
less than 0.05. Association between variables and 
antenatal depression were investigated using uni- 
variate analysis. Chi-squared test was used for 
categorical variables and Fisher’s exact test was 
used where expected cell sizes were less than ﬁve. 
For continuous variables, t-tests or Mann–Whitney 
U-tests were used for parametric or non parametric 
data where indicated. To identify factors indepen- 
dently associated with antenatal depression, vari- 
ables were entered into a binary forward stepwise 
logistic regression model, and odds ratios and 95% 
conﬁdence intervals (CI) were calculated. 

Only 26 of the 364 Asian women attending clinics 
were ineligible for inclusion in the study as they were 
unable to speak English. Of the 338 eligible women, 
300 participated; a response rate of 88.8%. Twenty- 
three women refused to participate and 15 ques- 
tionnaires were incomplete or not returned (see 
Table 1). Ninety-two women met the threshold score 
of greater than or equal to 12 for depression, giving a 
prevalence of 30.7% ( 95% CI 25.4–35.9%). Thus, the 
power of 
the study, based on equivalence of 
proportion, to investigate the association of antena- 
tal depression with male gender preference was 93%. 
Univariate analyses were conducted to identify 
associations between socio-demographic and cul- 
tural factors and antenatal depression (see Table 
1). Factors found to be signiﬁcantly associated with 
increased likelihood of depression were unplanned 
pregnancy, previous antenatal depression, previous 
postnatal depression, depression at some other 
time, feeling anxious in pregnancy, and family 
preference for a male child. Factors found to be 
signiﬁcantly associated with a decreased likelihood 
of developing depression included being satisﬁed 
with pregnancy, number of people providing sup- 
port, quality of support from family and friends as 
rated by women, and support from husband. 
Only 22/300 (7.3%) women desired a male child 
and there was no association with antenatal 
depression (see Table 2). Although the difference 
was not signiﬁcant, more women (28/300, 9.3%) 
desired a female child. Thirty-eight of 300 (12.7%) 
women stated that their family had a preference 
for a male child, and this was 
signiﬁcantly 
associated with antenatal depression. Most of the 
women whose families desired a male (31/38, 
81.6%) compared with those with no such prefer- 
ence (7/292, 2.4%) did not already have a male 
child. Among families of Indian women, 19.5% (16/ 
82) had a preference for a male relative to 9.8% 
(19/189) of the Pakistani women. 
A potential confounding factor in examining the 
role of gender preference was that some women 
(68, 22.7%) were aware of the sex of their baby. 
This was adjusted for by entering as a variable in 
the logistic regression model, along with other 
potentially confounding factors, but it was not 
found to be associated with antenatal depression. 
The logistic regression model showed, after adjust- 
ment, 
factors positively associated with 
antenatal depression were unplanned pregnancy, 
previous antenatal depression, depression at some 
other time, feeling anxious in the pregnancy and 
family preference for a male (see Table 3). Support 
from family and friends, being satisﬁed with 
pregnancy and being multiparous were negatively 
associated with antenatal depression.

and factors associated with antenatal depression in

women of Asian ethnicity living in the UK. The high 
prevalence of depression during pregnancy in this 
study (30.7%, 95% CI 25.4–35.9%) indicates that this 
poses an important issue for UK Asian women. This 
prevalence is higher than the 25% reported in 
Pakistan and 16% in India (Chandran et al., 2002; 
Rahman and Creed, 2007). It is also higher than the 
7–15% prevalence reported in studies from general 
populations in the developed world (Evans et al., 
2001; Joseffsson et al., 2001; Heron et al., 2004). It 
is comparable, however, with rates of postnatal 
depression found in Pakistan, India and the Middle 
East (Patel et al., 2002; Rahman et al., 2003; 
Ekuklu et al., 2004). However, it should be noted 
that some variation between depression rates could 
occur due to the utilisation of different methods to 
assess and record depression. 

This study speciﬁcally examined male gender 
preference and its association with antenatal 
depression. Only a few women (7.3%) had a 
preference for a male child; 
female 
preference was a little more common. Preference 
for a son exists in many countries in South East Asia 
and the Middle East, often due to social and 
cultural beliefs (Booth et al., 1994; Chandran et 
al., 2002; Patel et al., 2002; Ekuklu et al., 2004; 
Lofstedt et al., 2004). In countries such as India, 
economic pressures and religious pressures, such as 
funeral rites, also make sons more desirable than 
daughters (Arnold et al., 1998). A recent survey in 
Pakistan found a signiﬁcantly greater preference 
for male than female children (Zubair et al., 2007). 
Previous studies in the developing world have found 
an association between male gender preference 
and depression in the postnatal period, and a study 
in Egypt found that women who desired a son were 
more likely to have antenatal depression than 
women who desired a daughter (Kamal et al., 
1999). 
A history of previous antenatal depression or 
depression at some other time was found to be 
associated with antenatal depression and is con- 
sistent with the literature (O’Hara and Swain, 
1996). Previous postnatal depression did not remain 
in the predictive model even though this associa- 
tion is well documented in the literature. This is 
probably because it was very closely related with 
depression at some other time, which may have 
displaced it in the statistical model. Anxiety in 
pregnancy has been related to postnatal depression 
(Zubair et al., 2007). In the developing world, 
unwelcome or unplanned pregnancies have been 
found to be associated with postnatal depression 
(Ghubash and Abou-Saleh, 1997; Chandran et al., 
2002; Ekuklu et al., 2004). Again consistent with 
the literature, in both Western and non-Western 
societies, women with more support from family 
and friends were less likely to develop depression 
(Zuckerman et al., 1989; Hobfall et al., 1995; 
Se´guin et al., 1995; Bolton et al., 1998; Ritter et 
al., 2000; Chandran et al., 2002; Patel et al., 2002; 
Rahman et al., 2003). 
Although the questionnaires were anonymous, 
women often attended the clinic with their 
partners or family members and so this may have 
presented a situation for social desirability bias. 
Some of the EPDS questions enquire about personal 
issues, such as self-harm, and women may have 
been unwilling to divulge this information in the 
vicinity of family members or friends, which would 
have led to an underestimation of depression. 
Similarly, overestimations of support actually re- 
ceived may have been reported. Participants were 
asked to self-complete questionnaires but occa- 
sionally there appeared to be discussion with 
people accompanying them. Other studies in the 
developing world have observed that women 
misinterpreted the meanings of 
the 
questions, such as those about self-harm (Patel et 
al., 2002; Fisher et al., 2004), but in this study, 
comprehension of the questions did not seem to be 
an issue. An intrinsic limitation of the EPDS is that it 
is a screening tool and is not diagnostic, so it can 
only indicate those women with probable depres- 
sion (Murray and Cox, 1990). Nevertheless, it is 
validated for use in research to identify women 
with probable depression and has been used by 
previous studies for this purpose (Cox et al., 1987; 
Murray and Cox, 1990; Green and Murray, 1994). 
For logistical reasons, women unable to speak 
English were excluded from this study. Due to the 
diverse multi-ethnic population of Birmingham, it 
would not have been feasible to translate the 
questionnaire into all the various South East Asian 
languages spoken in the region. However, from the 
364 women approached, only 26 were excluded as 
they were unable to speak English. 

This study found high rates of antenatal depres- 
sion among Asian women in the UK. Antenatal 
depression has signiﬁcant impacts on the well-being 
of the mother and fetus, as well as progressing to 
postnatal depression, 
for which the negative 
implications on mother and child are well docu- 
Steer et al., 1992; 
mented (Murray, 1992; 
Hedegaard et al., 1993; Beck, 1995, 1998; Kurki 
et al., 2000; Andersson et al., 2004). Health 
practitioners should be aware that such a large 
proportion of women may be suffering from 
antenatal depression, especially given its adverse 
effects and its potential for management, either 
through drug treatment or psychological methods 
(Antenatal and Postnatal Mental Health, 2007). In 



antenatal clinics, utilisation of Whooley questions 
as recommended by National Institute for Health 
and Clinical Excellence guidelines may be bene- 
ﬁcial 
(Antenatal and Postnatal Mental Health, 
2007). 

The rates of antenatal depression were shown to be 
very high in this sample of Asian women living in the 
UK. Very few women stated a preference for a son, 
and maternal male gender preference was not 
associated with antenatal depression. Familial 
preference for a male child was not common but 
was associated with antenatal depression. Antena- 
tal depression has implications for fetal develop- 
ment and maternal health, and can progress to 
postnatal depression. Further studies to examine 
this are important. If this high rate of depression is 
conﬁrmed, consideration of early recognition and 
treatment may minimise the physical and emotion- 
ally distressing impact of this condition.
