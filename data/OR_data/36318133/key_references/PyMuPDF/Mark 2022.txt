Do Pregnancy Intentions Matter? A Research Note  
Revisiting Relationships Among Pregnancy, Birth,  
and Maternal Outcomes
Nicholas D. E. Mark and Sarah K. Cowan
ABSTRACT  The pre­ven­tion of unplanned or unin­tended preg­nan­cies con­tin­ues to be a 
cor­ner­stone of U.S. repro­duc­tive health pol­icy, but the evi­dence that such preg­nan­cies 
cause adverse mater­nal and child out­comes is lim­ited. In this research note, we exam­
ine these rela­tion­ships using recent large-scale data and inverse pro­pen­sity weights 
esti­mated from gen­er­al­ized boosted mod­els. We find that preg­nancy tim­ing is related 
to mater­nal expe­ri­ence dur­ing preg­nancy, but not to infant out­comes at birth—both of 
which are con­sis­tent with prior research. In an addi­tion to the lit­er­a­ture, we show that 
preg­nancy tim­ing is rel­e­vant for a num­ber of mater­nal out­comes, such as the onset of 
depres­sion and inti­mate part­ner vio­lence, changes in smok­ing behav­ior, and receipt of 
med­i­cal care. These find­ings sug­gest that pol­icy intended to improve infant wel­fare by 
pre­vent­ing unin­tended preg­nan­cies has lit­tle empir­i­cal sup­port, but that pol­icy focused 
on increas­ing repro­duc­tive auton­omy and mater­nal well-being has the poten­tial to 
improve out­comes.

Introduction
Preventing unin­tended or unplanned preg­nan­cies has long been a cor­ner­stone of U.S. 
repro­duc­tive health pol­icy, par­tially because infant and mater­nal out­comes are bet­ter 
after a planned ver­sus an unplanned preg­nancy (Brown and Eisenberg 1995; Gipson 
et al. 2008; Institute of Medicine 2011). These well-established asso­ci­a­tions helped 
jus­tify expanded con­tra­cep­tive insur­ance cov­er­age in the 2010 Affordable Care Act 
(Institute of Medicine 2011).
Despite its impor­tant influ­ence in pol­icy mak­ing, preg­nancy inten­tion—its rela­
tion­ship to out­comes, mea­sure­ment, and con­cep­tual value—has long been the sub­
ject of debate (Aiken et al. 2016; Kost and Lindberg 2015; Kost and Zolna 2019; 
Luker 1999; Potter et al. 2019; Trussell et al. 1999). Unintended preg­nan­cies have 
been asso­ci­ated with neg­a­tive fam­ily and child out­comes, even after con­trol­ling for 
mater­nal char­ac­ter­is­tics within a mul­ti­ple regres­sion frame­work (Cheng et al. 2009;

Joyce et al. 2000; Kost et al. 1998; Weller et al. 1987).1 However, other stud­ies have 
found almost no causal rela­tion­ship between preg­nancy inten­tions and preg­nancy or 
infant out­comes at birth (Joyce et al. 2000; Kost and Lindberg 2015). We make two 
con­tri­bu­tions to this debate.
First, we revisit the ques­tion of whether infants fare bet­ter when the preg­nancy 
was well-timed using a larger sam­ple and with more pre­cise mea­sures and meth­ods 
than prior work. We aim to deter­mine whether the asso­ci­a­tion between preg­nancy 
tim­ing (for preg­nan­cies taken to term) and adverse out­comes is due solely to mater­
nal char­ac­ter­is­tics that are cor­re­lated with preg­nancy tim­ing or whether preg­nancy 
tim­ing inde­pen­dently exerts a causal effect on out­comes. It is worth not­ing here, 
although we con­sider it more in the fol­low­ing, that we use the tra­di­tional sur­vey ques­
tion about whether the preg­nancy occurred when the woman wanted it to. Typically, 
this ques­tion has been used to mea­sure inten­tions. In light of sig­nif­i­cant cri­tiques of 
this operationalization, we instead use the lan­guage of tim­ing.
Second, we expand the scope of out­comes to include a range of mater­nal preg­nancy 
and post­par­tum out­comes. Much prior work addressed only infant out­comes at birth, 
child out­comes, or mater­nal out­comes directly affect­ing the in utero envi­ron­ment, such 
as mater­nal alco­hol or tobacco con­sump­tion (Gipson et al. 2008). Research has found 
links between preg­nancy inten­tion and the expe­ri­ence of inti­mate part­ner vio­lence 
(IPV) (Jasinski 2001) and post­par­tum depres­sion (Abajobir et al. 2016; Abbasi et al. 
2013; Fellenzer and Cibula 2014; Mercier et al. 2013; but see Christensen et al. 2011), 
as well as symp­toms of anx­i­ety and stress later in life (Biggs et al. 2017; Herd et al. 
2016), suggesting that mater­nal out­comes may be related to preg­nancy inten­tions.
Data
We ana­lyze data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), an 
annual sur­vey admin­is­tered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state 
health depart­ments of a strat­i­fied sam­ple of indi­vid­u­als who have recently given birth; 
respon­dents are contacted within 2–4 months of the live birth. Survey data are inte­grated 
with birth cer­tif­i­cate data, which are the source of many crit­i­cal infant out­comes at birth, 
such as birth weight and pre­term birth. We use Phase 7 data from 2012–2015, rep­re­sen­
ta­tive of births in par­tici­pat­ing states and 83% of births in the United States.
The PRAMS ques­tion­naire employs the tra­di­tional ques­tion to mea­sure preg­nancy 
inten­tion: “Thinking back to just before you got preg­nant with your new baby, how did 
you feel about becom­ing preg­nant?” Respondents choose one of five response options: 
“I wanted to be preg­nant later,” “I wanted to be preg­nant sooner,” “I wanted to be 
preg­nant then,” “I didn’t want to be preg­nant then or at any time in the future,” and “I 
wasn’t sure what I wanted.” If moth­ers reported that they wanted to be preg­nant later, 
the extent of mistiming was assessed with this fol­low-up ques­tion: “How much lon­ger 
did you want to wait to become preg­nant?” Response options were “less than 1 year,”  
1  People of all­ gen­ders give birth. In the United States, most extant data sets include char­ac­ter­iza­tion 
by gen­der but assume that it cor­re­sponds to sex assigned at birth, and thus it is unclear whether men (or 
other gen­ders) with a uterus pro­vided infor­ma­tion about births. For par­si­mony, we use female nouns and 
pro­nouns.

Do Pregnancy Intentions Matter?
“1 year to less than 2 years,” “2 years to less than 3 years,” “3 years to 5 years,” and 
“more than 5 years.” We divide these responses into two groups: whether preg­nan­cies 
were ear­lier than wanted by less than two years and whether they were ear­lier than 
wanted by two years or more. In Phase 7, PRAMS had added a new response option—“I 
wasn’t sure what I wanted.” Comparisons between Phases 7 and 6 indi­cate that respon­
dents who selected this option were drawn from all­ of the other options except “I wanted 
to be preg­nant then,” suggesting that this choice is dis­tinct from the other three choices 
(Maddow-Zimet and Kost 2020); there­fore, we include “unsure” as a fifth inten­tion 
­cat­e­gory. Our results are thus not strictly com­pa­ra­ble to ana­ly­ses employing a four-
cat­e­gory ­mea­sure of preg­nancy inten­tions, but they may have greater con­cep­tual validity.
We, like oth­ers, ques­tion the inter­pre­ta­tion of this ques­tion as cap­tur­ing “inten­tions” 
(Kost and Zolna 2019; Potter et al. 2019; Santelli et al. 2003). This con­cern is borne 
out of both con­cep­tual and mea­sure­ment issues. The con­se­quences are con­sid­er­able: 
unin­tended births can be con­strued as an inabil­ity or unwill­ing­ness to plan, a vio­la­
tion of Amer­i­cans’ notion of a respon­si­ble adult (Shim 2010). Therefore, rather than 
using the tra­di­tional lan­guage of “intended” and “unin­tended,” we hew more closely to 
the data in describ­ing preg­nan­cies as “then/sooner,” “wanted <2 years later,” “wanted 
≥2 years later,” “never/unwanted,” and “unsure.” We also share con­cerns that par­ents 
revise preg­nancy tim­ing pref­er­ences over the course of the preg­nancy and in light of 
infant well-being, leav­ing a ret­ro­spec­tive self-report vul­ner­a­ble to mea­sure­ment error. 
While typ­i­cally reports shift from unin­tended to intended, some stud­ies have shown the 
reverse (Guzzo and Hayford 2014; Joyce et al. 2002; Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1993; 
Westoff and Ryder 1977). Revision is par­tic­u­larly likely when the infant expe­ri­ences 
adverse health events, which is discussed in more detail in the fol­low­ing.
All depen­dent var­i­ables and sam­ple sizes are listed in Table 1.2 Each out­come is 
binary (yes/no). Pregnancy out­comes include when the mother rec­og­nized her preg­
nancy and whether she received pre­na­tal care within the first tri­mes­ter, gained the 
recommended weight dur­ing preg­nancy as defined by the Amer­i­can College of Obste­
tricians and Gynecologists (2013), engaged in smok­ing or drink­ing dur­ing preg­nancy, 
or expe­ri­enced the onset of IPV dur­ing preg­nancy. Infant out­comes at birth include 
whether the birth was pre­term and whether the new­born was low (<2,500 g) or very 
low (<1,500 g) birth weight, was small for ges­ta­tional age, was admit­ted to the inten­
sive care unit (ICU), or died before age 1. Maternal post­par­tum out­comes include 
moth­ers’ reports of ever breastfeeding or breastfeeding for at least three months, 
attend­ing a post­par­tum med­i­cal visit, and changes in depres­sion or smok­ing.
PRAMS data are col­lected from birthing par­ents who recently had a live birth and 
exclude those whose preg­nan­cies ended in mis­car­riage, abor­tion, or still­birth. We 
can­not assess whether mater­nal well-being dur­ing and after these preg­nan­cies var­
ied by preg­nancy tim­ing for those excluded pop­u­la­tions. Because access to abor­tion 
dif­fers by state of res­i­dence and eco­nomic and social priv­i­lege, selec­tion into unin­
tended birth is non­ran­dom. Our data are con­di­tional on this selec­tion pro­cess. Our 
ana­ly­ses com­pare moth­ers who reported that their preg­nan­cies were well-timed with 
oth­er­wise sim­i­lar moth­ers who reported that their preg­nan­cies were mistimed, but we 
can­not say whether these same moth­ers would have taken their preg­nan­cies to term if 
abor­tion had been more read­ily avail­­able.

The inde­pen­dent var­i­ables include a num­ber of the mother’s char­ac­ter­is­tics: age 
(≤19, 20–24, 25–29, ≥30), mar­i­tal sta­tus (mar­ried or other), race and eth­nic­ity (non-
His­panic White, His­panic, non-His­panic Black, non-His­panic other), edu­ca­tional 
attain­ment (less than high school, high school, some col­lege, col­lege or more), expe­
ri­ence of depres­sion before preg­nancy, num­ber of stress events in the 12 months 
before the birth, and state of res­i­dence. Other var­i­ables are infant’s birth order (first, 
sec­ond, third or higher) and whether pre­na­tal care was paid for by Med­ic­aid.
Methods
We use inverse pro­pen­sity weighting (IPW) to adjust the dis­tri­bu­tion of mater­nal 
char­ac­ter­is­tics so that preg­nancy tim­ing groups are sim­i­lar with respect to observed 
var­i­ables that are (1) related to the prob­a­bil­ity of assign­ment to a preg­nancy tim­ing

cat­e­gory and (2) influ­ence the out­come of inter­est. The goal of IPW is to elim­i­nate 
dif­fer­ences in con­found­ers between groups, essen­tially approx­i­mat­ing com­par­i­son 
groups that are equiv­a­lent on all­ char­ac­ter­is­tics except for group assign­ment. Assum­
ing that all­ con­found­ers are adjusted for, regressing preg­nancy tim­ing on the out­come 
of inter­est pro­vi­des unbi­ased esti­ma­tes of the mar­ginal causal effect of preg­nancy 
tim­ing (Austin and Stu­art 2015; Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983). Because we can­not 
account for all­ of the fac­tors that influ­ence preg­nancy tim­ing rel­a­tive to mater­nal 
pref­er­ences, includ­ing selec­tion into tak­ing preg­nan­cies to term, our results should 
not be interpreted as unbi­ased esti­ma­tes. Nevertheless, we can adjust for many of the 
major fac­tors that influ­ence preg­nancy tim­ing.
We use gen­er­al­ized boosted mod­els to esti­mate mul­ti­no­mial pro­pen­sity weights 
(McCaffrey et al. 2013). The pre­dic­tors we use are mother’s age, mar­i­tal sta­tus, race 
and eth­nic­ity, edu­ca­tion, and state of res­i­dence, as well as birth order and whether 
Med­ic­aid paid for pre­na­tal care.3 After the pro­pen­sity weights are esti­mated, they are 
mul­ti­plied by the sur­vey weights to per­mit cal­cu­la­tion of aver­age treat­ment effects 
that are rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the PRAMS pop­u­la­tion.
Because our ana­ly­ses of a five-level mea­sure span 19 out­comes, the p val­ues of 
indi­vid­ual coef­fi­cients are dif­fi­cult to inter­pret; but because the categories and out­
comes are not inde­pen­dent, stan­dard cor­rec­tions for mul­ti­ple com­par­i­sons, such 
as Bonferroni cor­rec­tions, are not appro­pri­ate (Perneger 1998). Thus, although we 
report the point esti­ma­tes and 95% con­fi­dence inter­vals, we urge cau­tion in interpret­
ing spec­i­fic­ity or sta­tis­ti­cal sig­nif­i­cance of indi­vid­ual coef­fi­cients, and we focus our 
dis­cus­sion on broad pat­terns of results while not­ing where indi­vid­ual results dif­fer 
sub­stan­tively from those pat­terns.
Results
As expected, moth­ers who wanted their preg­nan­cies then, sooner, or later but within 
two years were advan­taged com­pared with moth­ers in the three other groups (Table 
2): they had more years of edu­ca­tion, were more likely to be mar­ried, and were less 
likely to have had their pre­na­tal care paid by Med­ic­aid. Table 2 also shows that 
they were more likely to expe­ri­ence adverse preg­nancy, birth, and post­par­tum out­
comes. Disentangling these cor­re­la­tions requires adjusting for dif­fer­ences in moth­ers’ 
char­ac­ter­is­tics.
Figure 1 shows the unad­justed and IPW asso­ci­a­tions between preg­nancy tim­ing and 
preg­nancy expe­ri­ence, giv­ing out­comes with 95% con­fi­dence inter­vals. After adjust­
ment, women whose preg­nan­cies occurred less than two years before they wanted had 
sim­i­lar out­comes as their peers who wanted their preg­nan­cies then or sooner (the ref­
er­ence group). Those whose preg­nan­cies came two or more years sooner than wanted 
were less likely than the ref­er­ence group to rec­og­nize their preg­nancy in the first six 
weeks, to receive pre­na­tal care in the first tri­mes­ter, and to have quit smok­ing by the 
first or sec­ond tri­mes­ter, but were no less likely to have quit by the third tri­mes­ter. They 
were mar­gin­ally less likely to have gained the recommended amount of weight dur­ing

preg­nancy in the first six weeks, to receive pre­na­tal care in the first tri­mes­ter, and to 
have quit smok­ing dur­ing their preg­nancy, but were no less likely to have gained the 
recommended amount of weight or reduced their alco­hol con­sump­tion. Women who 
were unsure about their preg­nancy tim­ing were less likely to have received pre­na­tal 
care in the first tri­mes­ter and to have quit smok­ing dur­ing their preg­nancy. Finally, 
women who wanted to be preg­nant two or more years later, did not want to be preg­
nant, or were unsure how they felt were much more likely than the ref­er­ence group to 
expe­ri­ence the onset of inti­mate part­ner vio­lence dur­ing preg­nancy.
Despite these dif­fer­ences in mater­nal expe­ri­ence dur­ing preg­nancy by preg­nancy 
tim­ing, infants’ health at birth was quite sim­i­lar after pro­pen­sity weighting (Figure 2). 
The sign and the mag­ni­tude of the coef­fi­cients var­ied across out­comes, and few were 
sig­nif­i­cantly dif­fer­ent from zero. Of note, how­ever, is the result that chil­dren who 
were born from unwanted preg­nan­cies were sub­stan­tially less likely to die in their 
first year than those born from wanted preg­nan­cies. Given the rar­ity of this out­come 
and the poten­tial for selec­tive reporting and revi­sion (Smith-Greenaway and Sennott 
2016), we are hes­i­tant to draw firm con­clu­sions, but the direc­tion, mag­ni­tude, and 
pre­ci­sion of the esti­mate suggest that unwanted births are at least as likely to result 
in infant mor­tal­ity than wanted births. In sum, preg­nancy tim­ing may have affected 
mater­nal expe­ri­ence dur­ing preg­nancy, but did not mea­sur­ably impact infant health 
in utero.
Results for mater­nal post­par­tum out­comes are shown in Figure 3. Women whose 
preg­nan­cies were unwanted or arrived more than two years ear­lier than wanted and 
those who were unsure how they felt about their preg­nancy fared unam­big­u­ously 
worse than women whose preg­nan­cies were bet­ter timed, even after weighting. 
Among women who were depressed prior to preg­nancy, those with unwanted births, 
those who were unsure how they felt about their preg­nancy, and those whose preg­
nan­cies occurred more than two years before they wanted to be preg­nant were less 
likely than the ref­er­ence group to expe­ri­ence relief from their depres­sion. Women in 
these three categories who did not report depres­sion prior to preg­nancy were more 
likely to become depressed after giv­ing birth. They were less likely to report hav­ing 
reduced or quit smok­ing and were equally likely to report hav­ing increased smok­ing. 
Further, women whose preg­nan­cies were unwanted or who were unsure how they felt 
about their preg­nancy were less likely to attend a post­par­tum checkup.

Do Pregnancy Intentions Matter?
Women whose preg­nan­cies were ear­lier than they wanted were as likely as other 
moth­ers to have ever breastfed or to have breastfed for at least three months. Those 
whose preg­nan­cies were unwanted or who were unsure about their preg­nancy were 
less likely to have ever breastfed or to have breastfed for at least three months. These 
results com­ple­ment find­ings from Kost and Lindberg (2015), who found sim­i­lar rela­
tion­ships only for preg­nan­cies that were unwanted. Our results reveal that mean­ing­ful 
rela­tion­ships with breastfeeding extend beyond preg­nan­cies that were unwanted to 
those about which the mother felt unsure.
In sum, after account­ing for poten­tial con­found­ers, preg­nancy tim­ing was not 
asso­ci­ated with infant out­comes at birth, but women whose preg­nan­cies arrived 
sooner than they wanted had worse post­par­tum out­comes than those whose preg­nan­
cies were on time or arrived later than they wanted. Women who had preg­nan­cies 
that were unwanted or were mark­edly ear­lier than wanted, and women who were 
unsure about their preg­nancy, suf­fered numer­ous del­e­te­ri­ous out­comes and behav­
iors, includ­ing IPV, depres­sion, tobacco con­sump­tion, lack of early pre­na­tal care, and 
lack of post­par­tum care.

Do Pregnancy Intentions Matter?
Discussion
One jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for pub­lic pol­icy encour­ag­ing planned or intended preg­nan­cies, 
how­ever defined, is that intended preg­nan­cies are bet­ter for infants. Like pre­vi­ous 
research­ers, we find that this is unsup­ported by the data. By con­trast, our results 
high­light that preg­nancy tim­ing likely does mat­ter for mater­nal out­comes. We show 
that women who wanted to be preg­nant later, did not want to be preg­nant at all­, or 
were unsure about the best tim­ing for their preg­nancy were at higher risk of inti­mate 
part­ner vio­lence and post­par­tum depres­sion. Unwanted preg­nan­cies and preg­nan­cies 
about which the mother was unsure were also asso­ci­ated with lower rates of breast­
feeding. These results are con­sis­tent with work show­ing that mistimed preg­nan­cies 
taken to term may have neg­a­tive impacts on older chil­dren in the fam­ily, in par­tic­
u­lar through changes in home envi­ron­ments and par­ents’ cog­ni­tive and emo­tional 
resources (Barber et al. 1999; Barber and East 2009, 2011). Given that the preg­nancy 
tim­ing ques­tion was asked ret­ro­spec­tively, it is pos­si­ble that these rela­tion­ships are 
due to ex post revi­sion in light of adverse events. Such revi­sion is known to occur for 
infant out­comes (Smith-Greenaway and Sennott 2016), but more research is needed 
to under­stand their rela­tion­ships with mater­nal out­comes.
To mit­i­gate any neg­a­tive effects of unwanted or mistimed preg­nan­cies on mater­
nal out­comes, repro­duc­tive health pol­icy should be recentered around repro­duc­tive 
auton­omy and should include pol­i­cies such as uni­ver­sal access to no-cost con­tra­cep­
tion and abor­tion, com­pre­hen­sive sex edu­ca­tion, and equity in repro­duc­tive health 
care, with par­tic­u­lar atten­tion to mater­nal risks. Women who express that a preg­nancy 
was “unwanted” or “mistimed” are tell­ing us that they would have pre­ferred not to 
have become preg­nant at that time. Effective pol­icy would work with, rather than 
attempt to change, these pref­er­ences. ■
