Abstract
Background: Unintended pregnancies are common and when not resulting in a termination of pregnancy may
lead to unintended childbirth. Unintended pregnancies are associated with increased health risks, also for women
for whom pregnancy continues to childbirth. Our objective was to present the prevalence of unintended pregnancy in
six European countries among pregnant women attending routine antenatal care, and to investigate the association
with a history of physical, sexual and emotional abuse.
Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study, of 7102 pregnant women who filled out a questionnaire during
pregnancy as part of a multi-country cohort study (Bidens) with the participating countries: Belgium, Iceland,
Denmark, Estonia, Norway and Sweden. A validated instrument, the Norvold Abuse Questionnaire (NorAq) consisting of
10 descriptive questions measured abuse. Pregnancy intendedness was assessed using a single question asking women
if this pregnancy was planned. Cross-tabulation, Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression analysis were used.
Results: Approximately one-fifth (19.2 %) of all women reported their current pregnancy to be unintended. Women
with an unintended pregnancy were significantly younger, had less education, suffered economic hardship, had a
different ethnic background from the regional majority and more frequently were not living with their partner. The
prevalence of an unintended pregnancy among women reporting any lifetime abuse was 24.5 %, and 38.5 %
among women reporting recent abuse. Women with a history of any lifetime abuse had significantly higher odds
of unintended pregnancy, also after adjusting for confounding factors, AOR for any lifetime abuse 1.41 (95 % CI
1.23–1.60) and for recent abuse AOR 2.03 (95 % CI 1.54–2.68).
Conclusion: Women who have experienced any lifetime abuse are significantly more likely to have an unintended
pregnancy. This is particularly true for women reporting recent abuse, suggesting that women living in a violent
relationship have less control over their fertility.

Background
Unintended pregnancy and unintended childbirth can
have serious health, economic, and social consequences
for women and their families. Unintended childbearing
is associated with antenatal depression, continued risk
behavior including alcohol consumption and smoking,
failure to adapt health-improving behaviors like taking
folic acid and failure to initiate early antenatal care [1–5].
Unintended childbirth additionally increases the risk for
low birth weight and preterm birth, postnatal depression,
and negatively affects breastfeeding and bonding [6–9].
Studies suggest that 9–65 % of births worldwide are
the result of a pregnancy that was not planned [10–15].
The great variation in this prevalence is due to differences
in sampling and methodology as well as differences be-
tween cultures and countries. An unintended pregnancy
may be unwanted, mistimed or unexpected [15–18].
Studies suggest that the negative impact of unintended
pregnancies is greater for unwanted than for mistimed
or unexpected pregnancies [7, 16].
Unintended pregnancy is more common in younger
women, single women, women not cohabiting with their
partner, and women with more children [10, 19]. Studies
report that race, ethnicity and recent immigration influ-
ence the prevalence of unintended pregnancy and birth
[19, 20]. These studies suggest this may be due to racial
differences in women’s willingness to terminate unwanted
pregnancies and ethnic and religious issues regarding the
use of family planning and co-habiting. Furthermore,
studies suggest that women experiencing intimate part-
ner violence (IPV) are at greater risk of unintended
pregnancy [15, 21]. The proposed mechanisms for this
are, forced sex, fear of negotiating contraceptive use,
birth control sabotage, and partner interference with
access to healthcare [22, 23]. Unintended pregnancy
does not necessarily lead to unintended birth, but more
frequently to termination of pregnancy [24]. This is
why much of the research on the association between
violence against women and unintended pregnancy has
been performed by those working in the field of contra-
ception and gynecology as opposed to obstetrics [23, 25,
26]. Few studies from high-economic countries have
described the association between a history of physical,
sexual or emotional abuse and the occurrence of unin-
tended pregnancy among women planning to give birth
[21]. Those that do, present crude associations without
adjusting for obvious confounding factors, such as age,
education, marital- and economic status [14, 16]. The first
objective of our study was to present the prevalence of
unintended pregnancies among pregnant women intend-
ing to give birth in 6 European countries. The second ob-
jective of was to investigate the association between
unintended pregnancy and a history of physical, emotional
or sexual abuse by any/unknown perpetrator(s).
Methods
This prospective cross-sectional study uses data collected
during pregnancy as part of the Bidens cohort study, a
six-country (Belgium, Iceland, Denmark, Estonia, Norway,
and Sweden) study of women attending routine antenatal
care, between March 2008 and August 2010 [27].
The main aim of the Bidens cohort study was to assess
the association between a history of abuse and mode of
delivery and this determined the population size [27]. A
total of 7200 pregnant women who consented, subse-
quently completed a questionnaire and allowed for the
extraction of specified data on delivery from their med-
ical notes. The 68 -item questionnaire included several
validated instruments measuring fear of childbirth, abuse
and depression. Where a previously translated version
of the instruments were available, these were used.
Otherwise, the questionnaire was translated into the
required languages by a native speaker (Flemish, Icelandic,
Danish, Estonian, Russian, Norwegian and Swedish) and
then translated back again into the source language. The
original and back-translated versions were used to
determine the final version.
Due to country specific organization as well as re-
quirements of local ethic committees, minor variations
in the recruitment procedure occurred. In Belgium,
women were approached by the midwife or secretary
when attending antenatal care. Consenting women were
asked to complete the questionnaire in a separate room.
In Iceland women were recruited when attending rou-
tine ultrasound and returned completed forms by mail.
In Denmark women were given information about the
study when attending early routine ultrasound screening
and were mailed the questionnaire later. They returned
the questionnaire by mail or when attending their next
ultrasound examination. In Estonia women were invited
to participate while visiting for an antenatal consultation.
After completing the questionnaire it was left in a mail-
box at the clinic. In Norway women, after attending
routine ultrasound, received the questionnaire by mail
and returned it by mail. Non-responders were sent one
reminder. In Sweden, the questionnaire was adminis-
tered to women when attending routine glucose toler-
ance tests and filled out during the two hours gap
between the blood samplings. Belgium and Sweden were
not permitted to record non-participation. The esti-
mated response rate varied between 50 % in Norway to
90 % in Estonia.
All women required sufficient language skills to fill out
the questionnaire. In Estonia women could choose to
complete an Estonian or Russian language questionnaire.
In Belgium, Iceland and Denmark women less than
18 years of age were excluded. In Denmark, only women
from
the
local
geographical
area
were
invited.
In
Belgium, women who were not able to be separated

from their accompanying person were not recruited. In
Iceland, Denmark and Norway, women with major fetal
pathologies were excluded from the study.
Ethics
The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical
guidelines developed by the World Health Organization
(WHO) [28]. The information letter instructed women
to complete the form in a place where they could be un-
disturbed and included telephone numbers and e-mail
addresses to contact if needed. Additionally, in Belgium,
Estonia and Sweden, participants had the opportunity to
complete the questionnaires at the clinic, and measures
were installed to ensure accompanying persons were not
with them. Data was anonymized before analysis. Formal
approvals of local ethical committees were obtained in
each country, as listed below.

was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee in
Stockholm (2006/354-31/1), date: 14th June 2006.
Definition of variables
Whether a pregnancy was intended or not was assessed
using a single question which in 5 of the 6 countries was
worded “Was this pregnancy planned?” with a “yes” or
“no” answering option. In Sweden it was considered
culturally appropriate to pose the question as “Was this
pregnancy unplanned?” with the same response options.
The responses were harmonized through coding. The
questionnaire included questions on socio-economic
background, general and mental health, and obstetric
history. The questions on abuse were taken from the
Norvold Abuse Questionnaire (NorAQ), which was devel-
oped in a Nordic multi-center study among gynecological
patients [29]. This validated instrument includes 10
descriptive questions measuring emotional, physical,
and sexual abuse at increasing levels of severity, i.e.
mild, moderate and severe (Fig. 1) [30]. For each type
and level of abuse the answer categories were “no”, “yes
as a child”, “yes as an adult”, or “yes both as a child and
as an adult”. The responses were classified according to
the most severe level reported and categorized as either
adult or childhood abuse. Women were defined as having
experienced any abuse/any lifetime abuse if they answered
yes to at least one of the questions of sexual, emotional
and physical abuse [29]. The question measuring mild
physical abuse has shown low specificity in the validation
study and was therefore excluded [30].
In addition, women were asked if they had experienced
the abuse during the past 12 months, which in our
study was termed recent abuse. Parity was derived from
a question asking women how many children they
had given birth to. Women reported their education by
checking one of four predefined categories shown in
Table 1. Economic hardship was investigated by asking
women how easy it would be for them to pay a large bill
(3070 Euro or 4230 US $) within a week, adjusted by
countries’ consumer price index (CPI). The answering
option “very difficult” was defined as experiencing eco-
nomic hardship. Women were asked how many weeks
pregnant they were when filling out the form, which was
categorized as shown in the Table 1. Women whose
mother tongue was the national language were consid-
ered as ethnically belonging. As we recruited in Flanders
in Belgium this was Flemish, and in Estonia this was
Estonian.
Statistical analyses
Cross-tabulation and Pearson’s Chi square test were per-
formed to compare the prevalence of pregnancy intention
between countries and by selected socio-economic and
obstetric factors. Level of significance was set at p < 0.05,
two-sided. The association between pregnancy intention
and the different types of abuse was assessed by calcu-
lating Crude and Adjusted Odds Ratios (OR) with 95 %
Confidence Intervals (CI) using binary logistic regression
analysis. Based on the literature we entered the following a
priori selected covariates in the first model: age, education,
civil status, occupation, ethnicity, economic hardship and
gestational age. Neither occupation nor ethnicity influ-
enced the adjusted OR and they were therefore excluded
from the final models presented in the paper. Comparison
group consisted of women with no sexual, physical or
emotional abuse. Analyses were performed in PASW
Statistics (version 22.0).

Results
From the 7200 women who filled out the questionnaires
we excluded 39 women for whom we lacked informa-
tion pregnancy intendedness and 59 women who failed
to answer any of the questions for either emotional,
sexual or physical abuse, resulting in a sample of 7102
women. Approximately one-fifth (19.2 %) of all women
reported their current pregnancy to be unintended
(Table 2). There were significant differences between
the participating countries. The lowest prevalence was
found in Belgium (10 %), while Iceland had the highest
prevalence (26 %) (Table 2). These differences remained
significant after adjusting for age, civil status, education,
gestational age and economic hardship (Additional file 1:
Table S1).
Unintended pregnancy was significantly more com-
mon among women less than 25 years of age, those who
had less than 13 years of education, not living with their
partner, and students or women not working outside
their home (Table 1). Women whose mother tongue was
different form the local language at the study site were
significantly more likely to report having an unintended
pregnancy (Table 1).
The prevalence of an unintended pregnancy among
women not reporting any abuse was 15.8 % compared
to 24.5 % among those reporting any lifetime abuse
(Table 3). While the prevalence of unintended pregnancy
among women reporting recent sexual abuse was 51.7 %
(Table 3). Women with a history of abuse had signifi-
cantly higher odds of unintended pregnancy, also after
adjusting for confounding factors. This was particularly
true for recent abuse (Table 4).
We did not observe a dose–response effect between
unintended pregnancy and the categories mild, moderate
and severe abuse for any of the types of abuse (Additional
file 2: Table S2). When analysed by participating country,
the results all pointed in the same direction. However, the
adjusted association between unintended pregnancy and
any lifetime abuse was only significant for Norway and
Sweden (Additional file 3: Figure S1).

Discussion
Among pregnant women attending routine antenatal
care in 6 European countries, one in five women had
not intended to become pregnant. Women who have ex-
perienced abuse are more likely to report their current
pregnancy to be unintended. The association was signifi-
cant for all the types of abuse, also after adjusting for
confounding factors, and strongest for women reporting
recent abuse, who were twice as likely to have an unin-
tended pregnancy.
In our study, we assessed pregnancy intendedness
using a single question, asking women if their pregnancy
was “planned”. In Swedish the questions was the opposite,
asking women if the pregnancy was “oplanerad” which

directly translated means “unplanned” i.e. not planned.
Our analyses suggest this was the appropriate way of cul-
turally adapting the question, capturing the same concept.
It may be a limitation of our study that we assessed preg-
nancy intention with a single question, as the concept
is a complex one. American surveys have traditionally
used sets of question sequences yielding prevalence
estimates of a pregnancy being intended (i.e. wanted
at the time the pregnancy occurred), mistimed (wanted,
but not at the time it occurred) or unwanted (not wanted
at any time) [31].
A qualitative study by Barrett and Wellings found that
there is a vast variability in women’s understanding of
“planned” and “unplanned” [32]. Still, women in this
qualitative study thought the term “intended” was inter-
changeable with the term “planned” and they generally
preferred the terms “planned” and “unplanned” while posi-
tively disliking “unwanted” [32]. The British women in
Barret and Welling’s study applying the term “planned” in-
cluded not only the intention to become pregnant and
stopping contraceptives, but also partner agreement and
the right time in their life [32]. In contrast, “unplanned”
included not intending to get pregnant, failure to use
contraception, failure of contraception, and accident/
mistake [32]. As a result of their qualitative study,
Barrett and Welling’s suggested using more than one
question to assess the planning status of a pregnancy in
quantitative studies and together with Smith they devel-
oped an instrument consisting of 6 questions which they
stated, captures a more nuanced picture of intention [18].
However, when their instrument was used in a recent
study the 6 questions were used as a measuring scale
resulting in a score which then translated into two cat-
egories, unplanned and planned pregnancy [17]. The same
categories we used in our study. We conclude that even
though we only used a single question we very likely
captured the core concept. It needs to be emphasized that
women may be happy with the pregnancy even though it
was not intended [33, 34].
While previous studies have shown an association
between unintended pregnancy and physical and sexual
intimate partner violence (IPV) our study adds the asso-
ciation between emotional abuse and unintended preg-
nancy [11, 21]. Although not shown explicitly before,
emotional abuse certainly played a role in the results
of the previous studies on IPV. It is through threat,

degradation, humiliation and restriction of freedom a
woman can lose control over her own life and decisions
on fertility. A substantial proportion of women who suf-
fer from intimate partner physical and sexual violence
also are victims of emotional violence [35, 36]. Recent
abuse in our study occurred within the past 12 months
of filling out the questionnaire and was most strongly
associated with an unintended pregnancy. Women were
on average six months pregnant at the time of respond-
ing to the questionnaire. We did not inquire about the
perpetrator of the abuse in our study. However, based
on the literature, it is likely that the perpetrator of recent
abuse is the current partner and/or father of the unborn
baby [35, 37]. As such, our study confirms the findings
of others, i.e. an increased risk of unintended pregnancy
among women who suffer(ed) IPV.
Furthermore, our study showed that women with a
history of childhood abuse (<18 years of age) are at an
increased risk of an unintended pregnancy. The vast
body of research on childhood abuse shows that victims
are more likely to achieve less education, have more
physical and psychological complaints and psychiatric
and medical diagnoses, and partake in harmful behav-
iour such as substance abuse. All of which may influence
fertility control. In addition is re-victimization common,
i.e. women abused in childhood become victims of adult
abuse [36].
While we found significant associations for all the
types of abuse for the total sample, the same was not
true when we analysed by participating country. This is
most likely due to the reduced statistical power of these
smaller sub-samples.
A limitation of our study is that we have no infor-
mation if the father of the child intended the preg-
nancy. This could have given us more information on
the possible pathways of why women with a history
of abuse more frequently have an unintended preg-
nancy. Studies suggest that pregnancy coercion, birth
control
sabotage
and
reproductive
control
by
the
partner are part of the mechanism which increases
the risk for unintended pregnancy among women ex-
periencing intimate partner violence [22, 23]. Neither
have we information on the use of contraceptives.
Women using contraceptives while becoming preg-
nant are more likely to have an unwanted pregnancy.
Studies suggest that the negative impact of unintended
pregnancies is greater for unwanted pregnancies than for
mistimed pregnancies [16, 38].
We found significant differences in prevalence of unin-
tended pregnancy between the countries participating in
this study. In particular, Belgium and Denmark had a
lower prevalence than Estonia, Norway and Sweden
while Iceland had a higher prevalence. This could be
related to the fertility rate in the respective countries.
The thought behind this being that the more children
being born per woman the more likely they are to be
unplanned. Belgium and Denmark had a lower fertility
rate than Norway, Sweden and Iceland in 2008–2010
[39]. However, Estonia had the lowest fertility rate in
2010 among the countries participating in our study and
yet their prevalence of unintended pregnancy was similar
to Norway and Sweden. Research suggests that differ-
ences in the prevalence of unintended pregnancy is in-
fluenced by social, religious and cultural values which
influence the use of contraceptives, termination of preg-
nancy, and how family constellations and children are
valued [19, 20]. There are clear cultural, religious and
possibly social differences between the participating
countries. The benefits and sanctions women experience
when becoming pregnant may also contribute to the
differences. The extent of maternity leave and monetary
compensation varies greatly between countries. For ex-
ample, in Norway, a woman has 10–12 months of paid
maternity leave after the birth, provided she has worked
6 of the past 10 months. In Belgium, maternity leave is
limited to 10 weeks after birth. There are small differ-
ences between the countries when it comes to access
and price of contraceptives.
Although we recruited women attending routine ante-
natal care, just a few of them may not have intended to
continue with their pregnancy. We lack mode of delivery

for 308 of the women who filled out the questionnaire.
Among these, we found five women who reported an
unplanned pregnancy and who had a gestational length
of less than 17 weeks. All five were from Estonia and
could still have decided to have a termination of preg-
nancy. However, the numbers are so few that they would
not have affected our overall results.
The large sample of unselected pregnant women from
six European countries is a major strength of this study.
In addition is our study prospective, i.e. women reported
pregnancy intention while pregnant. This is thought to
give a more correct estimate of unintended pregnancies
as studies suggest that there is a pronounced tendency
for births which prospectively were classified as un-
wanted to be retrospectively described as wanted or
mistimed [39].
We assessed the association of unintended pregnancy
with physical, sexual and emotional abuse either as a
child or as an adult. This is in contrast to other studies,
which are mostly limited to intimate partner violence/
domestic violence and none investigate the when they
investigate the association between abuse and pregnancy
intention, [11, 12, 21, 37]. A strength of our study is that
abuse was measured using the 10 descriptive questions
of the Norvold Abuse, which has been validated among
Swedish women attending gynaecology outpatients de-
partments and has been previously used in several of the
Scandinavian countries also included in our present
study [29, 30]. The population in these studies was simi-
lar to the population in our study. However, a limitation
of the study is that the questions have not been validated
in other countries beside Sweden [30].
It is difficult to compare the prevalence of intended
pregnancy in our study with studies using the terms
mistimed and unwanted pregnancy [15]. Our findings
are in agreement with a study from Southern Sweden
who reported 14.1 % of unintended pregnancies among
those without and 23.1 % among those with a history of
abuse [14].
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that women, who experienced
physical, emotional or sexual abuse in childhood, adult-
hood or both, are more likely to experience an unin-
tended pregnancy. The strongest association was found
for abuse experienced within the past 12 months. If, as
we supposed, women experienced this recent abuse
from their current partner/father of the unborn child,
they may be concerned for the welfare of their child
as well as their own and the consequences of having
a baby together with this person may have. From all
perspectives, these are vulnerable women, who should
be identified and offered appropriate services during
pregnancy.
