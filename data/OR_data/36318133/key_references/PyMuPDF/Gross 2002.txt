Objective: This study identiﬁed correlates of self-reports of being very depressed in the months
after delivery in a population-based sample of women. Methods: We analyzed data on 14,609
recent mothers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Pregnancy Risk
Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). The sample included mothers who delivered a live
birth in Colorado, New York State, and North Carolina from 1996 (New York only) to 1999.
We assessed risk factors for self-reports of being very depressed in the months after delivery
using logistic regression. Results: Overall, 5.9% (95% CI = 5.3, 6.4) of new mothers reported
being very depressed in the months after delivery. Women who reported that their pregnancy
was a “very hard time” or “one of the worst times of my life” had the highest prevalence of
reporting being very depressed in the months after delivery (24.9%, 95% CI = 21.3, 28.5) and,
when all risk factors were adjusted for simultaneously, were 4.6 times (95% CI = 3.1, 6.3) more
likely to report being very depressed in the months after delivery than other women. Other
signiﬁcant risk factors for self-reports of being very depressed in the months after delivery
included experiencing partner-associated stress (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.5, 2.5), physical abuse
during pregnancy (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1, 2.4), and not breast-feeding (OR = 1.4, 95%
CI = 1.1, 1.8). Conclusions: The highest prevalence for self-reports of being very depressed in
the months after delivery was in women who reported that their pregnancy was a “very hard
time” or “one of the worst times of my life.” Clinicians need to be aware of the needs of some
women for mental health services both during and after pregnancy.

INTRODUCTION
Postpartum depression is a serious condition that
negativelyaffectsthequalityoflifeanddailyfunction-
ing of new mothers. In addition, it is linked to prob-
lemswithmaritalrelationships,mother/childbonding,
and infant behavior and/or development (1–8). Es-
timates of the prevalence of postpartum depression
range from 7 to 24% (9–14), with the highest preva-
lence in lower socioeconomic groups (11).

Demographic variables such as education (2, 12, 15)
and parity (15) have been found to be associated with
postpartum depression. Social and economic factors
include being unemployed or having lost a job (10,
14, 16); experiencing stressful life events (10, 17, 18);
living without a spouse (10, 11, 15,16); and being di-
vorced or separated, having marital discord, or living
with an unsupportive spouse (1, 12, 17). Individual
risk factors include having an unplanned or unwanted
pregnancy (14, 16, 19) and not breast-feeding (14–
16, 19). In addition, several studies have found that
the strongest predictor of postpartum depression was
previous depression (11, 17). A meta-analysis on post-
partum depression found a history of depression to be
one of the strongest and most consistent predictors of
postpartum depression (18).
Two weaknesses of most previous studies are that
they are based on clinical samples and test discrete
risk factors. This study addresses these weaknesses
by analyzing a population-based sample which allows
for the results to be more generalizable. It also incor-
porates a broad and large number of potential risk
factors and has a sufﬁcient sample size to identify risk
factors independently associated with being very de-
pressed in the months after delivery of a live infant.
Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify the cor-
relates of self-reports of being very depressed in the
months after delivery using a population-based sam-
ple of women. We analyzed data from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Pregnancy
Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) and
included mothers who delivered a live birth in
Colorado, New York State, and North Carolina.
METHODS
The CDC initiated PRAMS in 1987 to provide
state-speciﬁc, population-based surveillance of se-
lected maternal behaviors that occur before, during,
and after pregnancy. In each PRAMS state, a monthly
random, stratiﬁed, systematic sample of 100–250 new
mothers is selected from birth certiﬁcates. Each state
stratiﬁes the sample by different variables and over-
sampleswomenfromhigh-riskgroups(e.g.,thosewith
a low birth weight infant, inadequate prenatal care,
or who received Medicaid). The women sampled are
mailed a 14-page questionnaire 2–6 months after de-
livery, with up to two additional questionnaires for
nonrespondents. If nonresponse persists, telephone
interviews are attempted. Women respond, on aver-
age, 3 months after delivery. The PRAMS analysis
dataset includes information from the questionnaire
and the infant’s birth certiﬁcate.
Currently, PRAMS is conducted in 32 states.
Three states, Colorado, New York (excluding New
York City), and North Carolina, collect information
on self-reports of being very depressed in the months
after delivery and are included in this analysis. The
data are from 1996 for New York State and 1997–1999
for all three states. The overall response rate was 73%
(73%forColorado,71%forNewYorkState,and74%
for North Carolina).
Of the 15,815 mothers who responded to the
PRAMS questionnaire, we excluded 955 mothers
(6%) whose infants had died by the survey date to
avoid the potentially confounding effect of infant loss
on being very depressed in the months after deliv-
ery. We excluded an additional 251 (1.6%) women be-
cause of missing information on being very depressed
in the months after delivery. The study sample con-
sisted of 14,609 women who delivered a live birth in
Colorado, New York State, or North Carolina.
Measurement of Variables
Self-reports of being very depressed in the
months after delivery were based on women’s re-
sponses to the PRAMS question, “[I]n the months
after your delivery, would you say that you were not
depressed at all, a little depressed, moderately de-
pressed, very depressed, or very depressed and had
to get help?” These ﬁve response categories were col-
lapsed into two groups for our analysis. The “not de-
pressed” group included mothers who reported being
“not depressed at all,” “a little depressed,” or “mod-
erately depressed.” The “very depressed group” in-
cluded mothers who reported being “very depressed”
or “very depressed and had to get help.” We chose a
conservative deﬁnition to capture the most clearly de-
pressed group of women.
The
PRAMS
questionnaire
included
one
question that captured the emotional state during
pregnancy: “[H]ow would you describe the time
during your pregnancy?” The responses “one of the
happiest times of my life,” “a happy time with few
problems,” or “a moderately hard time” were com-
bined into a “happy” group. Those who responded
“a very hard time” or “one of the worst times of
my life” were combined into a “very hard time”
group.
We obtained information on the following so-
ciodemographic factors, previously found to be

associated
with
postpartum
depression
in
the
literature, from the birth certiﬁcates: maternal age,
race, ethnicity, education, and infant birth weight (2,
9, 10, 14, 16–19). Education was categorized into less
than high school graduate, high school graduate, and
morethanhighschoolgraduate.Racewascategorized
into White, African American, and other (includ-
ing Native American/American Indian, Asian/Paciﬁc
Islander, and other groups). Hispanic ethnicity was
collected and reported as a separate variable. Low
birth weight was deﬁned as those infants weighing
less than 2500 g at birth.
Single adult households, Medicaid recipients,
length of infant hospital stays, stress events, physical
abuse during pregnancy, pregnancy intention, breast-
feeding, and parity came from the PRAMS question-
naire.
To capture stress events, the PRAMS question-
naire included a list of 13 stress events and asked
women if they had experienced any of them during
the 12 months prior to delivery. The 13 items were
grouped into four constructs on the basis of the work
of Ahluwalia et al. who used principal component
analysis to develop them (20). In principal component
analysis, the individual items are correlated with other
similar items and represent, as a whole, a construct
that individual items may not capture. The four con-
structs include emotional (very sick family member,
someone very close died), partner associated (sepa-
rated or divorced, argued more than usual with part-
ner or husband, husband or partner said he did not
want pregnancy), ﬁnancial (moved to a new address,
husband or partner lost his job, mother lost her job,
bills could not be paid), and traumatic (homeless, in-
volved in a physical ﬁght, mother or husband or part-
ner went to jail, someone very close had a problem
with drinking or drugs) (20).
Pregnancy intention was ascertained from the
questionnaire and deﬁned as intended if the woman
stated that she wanted to be pregnant then or sooner,
mistimed if the woman stated that she wanted to be
pregnant later, or unwanted if the woman did not
want to be pregnant then or at any time in the fu-
ture. Women were considered physically abused if
they reported being physically abused by the husband
or partner, another family or household member, or
someone else during the pregnancy. Breastfeeding
was coded as “yes” if the woman reported breast-
feeding for more than 1 week. The range of missing
values for the sociodemographic risk factors ranged
from .05% for physical abuse to 7% for pregnancy
intendedness.
Statistical Analysis
Because the prevalence and the risk factors for
self-reports of being very depressed in the months
after delivery were similar in all three states, we ana-
lyzed the data from all three states together. We cal-
culated prevalence percentages with 95% conﬁdence
intervals (CIs) for self-reports of being very depressed
in the months after delivery by the potential risk fac-
tors. We conducted logistic regression analysis to as-
sess if these same factors were independently associ-
ated with being very depressed in the months after
delivery. We considered odds ratios (ORs) with 95%
CIs that did not include 1.0 to be signiﬁcant. All data
presented have been weighted to account for nonre-
sponse. We analyzed data using SUDAAN software
to account for the weighting and complex sampling
design of PRAMS.
RESULTS
Looking at the ﬁve response categories of self-
reported depression, the majority of women reported
that they experienced a little depression (42.3%; 95%
CI = 41.1, 43.5) in the months after delivery followed
closely by the proportion of women who reported no
depression (40.2%; 95% CI = 39.1, 41.4). Problems
with moderate depression were reported by 11.6%
(95% CI = 10.9, 12.4) of the women, 4.4% (95% CI =
3.9, 4.9) stated that they were very depressed, and
1.4% (95% CI = 1.1, 1.7) indicated that they were
very depressed and had to get help.
Demographic features of the women in the study
are presented in the ﬁrst column of Table I. Over-
all, 5.9% (95% CI = 5.3, 6.4) of the mothers were
in the very depressed group. Levels of self-reports
of being very depressed in the months after deliv-
ery were highest for women who reported that the
pregnancy was “a very hard time” or “the worst time
of my life” (24.9%), experienced physical abuse dur-
ing pregnancy (15.8%), had an unwanted pregnancy
(13.7%), or experienced traumatic stressful life events
(13.0%) (Table I, column 2). Other groups of women
who had a higher prevalence of self-reports of be-
ing very depressed in the months after delivery than
the overall average prevalence were women who were
the only adults in the household, experienced partner-
associated stressful events, were African American,
were aged less than 20 years, were not high school
graduates, received Medicaid, or had a low birth
weight infant or an infant who stayed in the hospital
longer than they did.

Results from the logistic regression analysis, ad-
justing for all factors simultaneously, are also pre-
sented in Table I. Women who reported that their
pregnancy was a “very hard time” or “one of the
worst times” were 4.6 times (95% CI = 3.4, 6.3) more
likely to report being very depressed in the months
after delivery than women who were happy during
pregnancy. Other risk factors for self-reports of be-
ing very depressed in the months after delivery in-
cluded experiencing partner-associated stress (OR =
1.9, 95% CI = 1.5, 2.5), physical abuse during preg-
nancy (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1, 2.4), and not breast-
feeding (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1, 1.8).
DISCUSSION
The results of this study suggest that the women
who had the strongest risk for self-reports of be-
ing very depressed in the months after delivery were
those who reported that their pregnancy was a “very
hard time” or “one of the worst times.” Other stud-
ies have found that depression during pregnancy (1,
9, 11–13,18, 21) or a previous history of depression is
a strong predictor of postpartum depression (11, 17,

Correlates of Being Very Depressed in the Months After Delivery
251
18, 21). The second strongest predictor of self-reports
of being very depressed in the months after delivery
in our study, experiencing partner-associated stress, is
also consistent with the ﬁndings of previous studies
(1, 12, 17).
In addition, we found an association between
having been physically abused during pregnancy and
self-reports of being very depressed in the months
after delivery. Other studies have also found higher
rates of depression among women who have been
abused than among women who have not (22), as well
as higher rates of past experiences of physical abuse
among depressed women (23). But to our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate an association
between the abuse occurring during pregnancy and
self-reports of being very depressed occurring post-
partum.
Not breastfeeding has been found consistently
to be a risk factor for postpartum depression (14–16,
19). We found a modest association (OR 1.4, 95%
CI = 1.1, 1.8) between not breastfeeding and self-
reports of being very depressed in the months after
delivery. When we stratiﬁed on emotional state dur-
ing pregnancy (data not shown), we found an associ-
ation between not breastfeeding and self-reports be-
ing very depressed in the months after delivery only
among women who reported the pregnancy was a
“very hard time” or “one of the worst times” (OR 1.7,
95% CI = 1.1–2.6). Among women who were happy
during pregnancy, there was no association between
not breast-feeding and being very depressed in the
months after delivery (OR 1.2, 95% CI = 0.9–1.6).
We hypothesize that not breastfeeding is a result of
thedepression,notariskfactor.Womenwhoreported
that they were very depressed after delivery may have
been less likely to initiate breastfeeding because of
the difﬁculties they were experiencing. In addition,
some women may have decided not to breast-feed
because they were taking antidepressive medications
and did not want to expose their newborns to these
drugs.
The percentage of women reporting being very
depressed during the months after delivery (5.9%)
found in PRAMS data from three states is below the
range of estimates of postpartum depression reported
in other studies (9, 10, 12–14, 24, 25), probably be-
cause of methodological differences. The measure-
ment of self-reports of being very depressed in the
months after delivery in this study was based on a
single, unvalidated question asked of new mothers
3 months, on average, after delivery. We cannot as-
sess whether the women who self-identiﬁed as very
depressed postpartum in PRAMS met the clinical
deﬁnitions of postpartum depression. The Diagnos-
tic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV deﬁnition of ma-
jor depression includes either depressed mood or de-
creased interest or pleasure in activities, in addition
to the experience of four other symptoms (such as
changes in appetite, sleeping patterns, and fatigue)
most of the day for at least 2 weeks (26). The women
in this study experienced depressed mood, but we do
not have information on its duration, the other symp-
toms, or on the length of time they experienced them.
The lower percentage of women reporting de-
pression during the months after delivery in this study
may also be a result of selective nonresponse. Women
who chose not to respond to the PRAMS question-
naire may have been more likely to be depressed.
We also chose to be conservative in our deﬁnition
of the very depressed category. We did not include
the “moderately depressed” women in the very de-
pressed group. Therefore, we may have misclassiﬁed
some women, who should have been included in the
very depressed group but perhaps did not report that
they were very depressed. If we included the “mod-
erately depressed” women, the prevalence of self-
reports of being very depressed in the months after
delivery would be 17.5%. Nevertheless, we decided to
keep in the exposed group only those who reported
that they were very depressed because whether or
not they had clinical depression, their reports of be-
ing very depressed suggest they were in need of some
kind of support or services. For women who reported
that they were moderately depressed, the need for ser-
vices is less clear. Some of these women may be very
depressed but unwilling to report it and some of these
women may have short-term negative experiences
that resolve themselves without clinical services. The
threshold for deﬁning women with depressed symp-
toms is ultimately arbitrary, and could also inﬂuence
our ﬁndings. Given that this study used an unex-
plored matrix, we chose a conservative deﬁnition for
depression.
Another limitation of these data is that the retro-
spective collection of the information, such as stress
events and emotional state during pregnancy, could
introduce recall bias. For example, women who were
depressed when completing the questionnaire may
have been more likely than women who were not
depressed to remember the difﬁculties or negative
experiences during their pregnancy. In turn, these
women may have been more likely to describe the
period when they were pregnant as a difﬁcult or hard
time. The same could also be said for women who

252
Gross, Wells, Radigan-Garcia, and Dietz
reported not being very depressed after pregnancy,
who may have been more likely than the depressed
women to report that they were happy during their
pregnancy. The recall bias would overestimate the as-
sociation between not being happy during pregnancy
and self-reports of being very depressed in the months
after delivery. While the magnitude of this ﬁnding may
have been overestimated in this study, the association
is consistent with the ﬁndings in other studies (1, 9,
11, 12, 18, 21), suggesting that it is real.
Strengths of this study are that it is population-
based and the ﬁndings can be generalized to women
giving birth in Colorado, New York State, or North
Carolina. Also, by having a large sample size and 16
potential risk factors, we were able to assess the inde-
pendent association of a variety of demographic, so-
cial, economic, individual, and infant risk factors with
self-reports of being very depressed in the months af-
ter delivery. In doing so, we found that the woman’s
self-reported emotional state during pregnancy was
the most signiﬁcant predictor of self-report of be-
ing very depressed in the months after delivery and
that many sociodemographic variables that were as-
sociated with postpartum depression in clinical sam-
ples were not associated with self-report of being
very depressed after delivery in this population-based
sample.
The results of this study indicate that over 10%
of women reported that they had a very hard time
during pregnancy and 5.9% reported being very de-
pressed in the months after delivery. For the three
states studied, this translates to approximately 23,900
women during pregnancy and 15,500 women during
the postpartum period who may be in need of ser-
vices annually. Effective psychotherapy and pharma-
cological treatment models are available for depres-
sion (25–30). Clinicians need to be aware of the needs
of some women for mental health services both during
and after pregnancy.
