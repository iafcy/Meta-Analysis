Abstract 
Background:  Studies report heightened risks of mental health problems among women who experience an unin-
tended pregnancy, but few consider the complexity of pregnancy intentions. In this study, we evaluate how different 
dimensions of pregnancy intentions (pregnancy planning and pregnancy acceptance) relate to two maternal depres-
sive symptoms and perceived psychological distress.
Methods:  This study draws from a cross-sectional national survey conducted in all maternities in France over a one-
week period in 2016. All mothers 18 years and older who had a live birth during the study period were invited to par-
ticipate. After excluding women who underwent infertility treatment, our analytical sample included 10,339 women. 
We first described levels and correlates of pregnancy planning and acceptance, defined in four categories; planned/
welcomed, unplanned/welcomed, planned/unwelcomed, unplanned/unwelcomed. We then assessed the bivariate 
and multivariate associations between pregnancy planning and acceptance and two outcomes: women’s self-per-
ceived psychological health and the presence of two depressive symptoms during pregnancy. We used multivariate 
logistic regressions to evaluate these associations, after adjusting for socio-demographic and medical factors.
Results:  Altogether 7.5 to 24.1% of mothers perceived their psychological health during pregnancy was poor, 
according to pregnancy planning and acceptance categories and 10.3 to 22.4% indicated feelings of sadness and loss 
of interest during pregnancy, according to pregnancy planning and acceptance categories. As compared to women 
with planned/welcomed pregnancies, the odds of perceived poor psychological health and depressive symptoms 
were 2.55 times (CI 2.20–2.95) and 1.75 times higher (CI 1.51–2.02), respectively, among unplanned/unwelcomed 
pregnancies and 2.02 (CI 1.61–2.53) and 2.07 (CI 1.7–2.5) higher, among planned/unwelcomed pregnancies. Among 
women with unplanned pregnancies, we also found higher odds of perceived poor psychological health among 
women whose pregnancy was unwelcomed while the odds of depressive symptoms were not different by pregnancy 
planning status among women with unwelcomed pregnancies.
Conclusions:  These findings consolidate previous reports of the association between pregnancy intentions and 
maternal psychological distress, while further specifying the relationship, which mostly depends on the acceptance

Background
Despite widespread contraceptive coverage in high-
income countries, the proportion of pregnancies that 
are unintended ranges from 34% in the Unite Kingdom 
[1], to 36% in France [2] and 46% in the United States [3]. 
Unintended pregnancies represent a significant public 
health concern due to associated increases in maternal 
and perinatal morbidity [4].
Recent attention has concentrated on the associa-
tion between pregnancy intentions and mental health, 
as poor mental health is suggested to be a cause and 
consequence of unintended pregnancy. Some studies 
indicate that depressive symptoms affect contraceptive 
choices and practices [5], which determine unintended 
pregnancy risk [6, 7]. Other studies suggest experienc-
ing an unintended pregnancy is likely to cause stress, 
which may contribute to heightened risk of poor mental 
health [8]. Two meta-analyses reported an increase in the 
prevalence of antepartum depression among women who 
experienced an unintended birth [9, 10]. While the causal 
pathways linking pregnancy intentions to poor psycho-
logical health are complex, the implications are profound 
for mothers and infants given the associations between 
maternal depression and other behaviors, such as sub-
stance use [11], and the consequences on perinatal health 
and child development [12, 13].
A growing body of work has questioned the relevance 
of the dichotomous indicator of unintended pregnancy, 
defined as the combination of unwanted and mistimed 
pregnancies [14–16]. A systematic review supports the 
use of more nuanced indicators, showing the risk of 
maternal depressive symptoms is greater among women 
who have an unwanted birth compared to a mistimed 
birth [10]. Likewise, Gariepy et al.’s prospective study in 
the US suggests that the acceptance of the timing of preg-
nancy is a better predictor of mental health than initial 
pregnancy plans [17]. Similar results were reported in a 
Swedish study [18], while a network analysis exploring 
the co-occurrence of maternal psychosocial risks among 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive women 
indicates that distress about pregnancy rather than 
intention was the most central feature in a network of 
psychosocial risks and was strongly related to antenatal 
depression [19].
These findings support Aiken et al.’ framework focus-
ing on pregnancy acceptability as a salient measure 
to inform maternal health [16]. The ways in which 
women’s perspectives on pregnancy relate to their psy-
chological health during pregnancy deserves further 
consideration, as the acceptability of a pregnancy is 
tied to economical or relational circumstances that also 
affect health processes [4]. Building on this work, we 
investigate the intersecting contribution of pregnancy 
planning and acceptance on antenatal psychological 
distress, in the form of perceived psychological health 
and two depressive symptoms, among women giving 
birth in France in 2016.
Material and methods
This study draws from the 2016 French National Peri-
natal Survey [20]. The survey included all mothers who 
gave birth in France over a one-week period. Women 
were invited to participate in the study after delivery, 
during their maternity admission and were interviewed 
by trained midwives who collected information about 
their sociodemographic characteristics, pregnancy 
intentions and contraceptive behaviors at the time 
of conception, and their health and behaviors during 
pregnancy, including care-seeking behaviors. The sur-
vey included additional self-administered questions at 
the end of the interview. Medical information related 
to maternal health was extracted from medical health 
records.
Study population
A total of 13,147 women delivered during the sur-
vey implementation and 12,964 were eligible (women 
younger than age 18 (n = 56) and women who deliv-
ered a stillbirth were not eligible). A total of 1202 
eligible women were not interviewed: 543 refused par-
ticipation, 245 did not speak French, 144 suffered seri-
ous medical complications for themselves or their child, 
and 79 left the facility before the scheduled interview. 
For this analysis, we further excluded 806 women who 
underwent infertility treatment. Finally, we excluded 
394 women with missing information about preg-
nancy planning or acceptance and 23 to 223 women 
with missing information on one of the psychological 
health outcomes. Our final analytical sample comprised 
between 10,339 and 10,539 women.
of pregnancy timing rather than on pregnancy planning. Identifying women with low pregnancy acceptance can 
potentially enhance current medical practice by improving early detection of maternal depression.

Measures
We used a proxy measure of women’s planning and 
acceptance of pregnancy as a combination of pre-con-
ception contraceptive behaviors and women’s reac-
tion to the timing of the pregnancy. Specifically, we 
assessed pregnancy planning as a function of wom-
en’s contraceptive behavior prior to pregnancy with 
response options distinguishing between women who 
ceased contraception to become pregnant (planned 
pregnancy) from those who stopped following a con-
traceptive failure or for another reason (unplanned 
pregnancy). Women were also asked about their reac-
tion to the timing of the pregnancy with the following 
response options: “happy to be pregnant now”; “would 
have liked to be pregnant sooner”; “would have liked to 
be pregnant later”; and “did not want to be pregnant at 
all”. Combining the reported contraceptive behaviors 
and women’s acceptance of the timing of the pregnancy, 
we categorized women into four categories of preg-
nancy planning and acceptance: planned/welcomed, 
planned/unwelcomed 
unplanned/welcomed, 
and 
unplanned/unwelcomed (Fig. 1).
We considered the following sociodemographic fac-
tors: age, parity, cohabitation status, education, house-
hold income, type of health insurance, country of birth 
and history of abortion. Women’s chronic medical con-
ditions prior to pregnancy (ie., diabetes, hypertension, 
HIV, or any other chronic diseases requiring precon-
ception care) were extracted from the medical records 
and combined in a single measure. These conditions, 
however, did not include antecedents of mental health 
illness.
The main mental health distress outcomes were 
assessed using two indicators: women’s self-assessment 
of their psychological health during the pregnancy, 
and two depressive symptoms during two consecutive 
weeks in pregnancy. Specifically, women were asked to 
assess their psychological health during the pregnancy 
(response options included good, fairly good, not very 
good, and bad). They subsequently self-completed two 
questions corresponding to a modified version of the 
Patient health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ2) indicator [21] 
about feelings of sadness, depression or hopelessness, 
and about loss of interest in most things, such as lei-
sure activities. Unlike the PHQ2 questions assessing 
the frequency of symptoms over the last 2 weeks, our 
questions examined the presence or absence of these 
symptoms over two consecutive weeks during preg-
nancy. Thus, we were unable to calculate the PHQ2 
score ranging from 0 to 6 based on frequency of each 
symptom [21] but instead, constructed a binary meas-
ure of depressive symptoms based on the presence of 
both symptoms for two consecutive weeks during the 
course of the pregnancy. We also defined an indicator 
assessing the presence of both depressive symptoms 
and perceived poor psychological health. Finally, to 
examine care-seeking behaviors, women were asked 
if they had consulted a health professional (medical

doctor, psychologist or psychotherapist) for psycholog-
ical reasons during the pregnancy.
Statistical analyses
We first described pregnancy planning and acceptance 
according to women’s sociodemographic characteristics 
and conducted a multinomial logistic regression model. 
We then estimated the prevalence of women’s perceived 
psychological health and the prevalence of experiencing 
two depressive symptoms during two consecutive weeks 
in the course of the pregnancy. We examined the soci-
odemographic and reproductive health factors related to 
these psychological distress measures.
Next, we conducted a series of multivariate logistic 
regressions to evaluate the associations between our 
four-category measure of pregnancy planning/accept-
ance and each psychological distress outcome (perceived 
psychological health, two depressive symptoms and care 
seeking behaviors), after adjusting for sociodemographic 
and medical factors. We also conducted two sub-anal-
yses, first comparing psychological distress outcomes 
according to pregnancy acceptance among women who 
reported their pregnancy was unplanned and then com-
paring psychological distress outcomes according to 
pregnancy planning among women who reported their 
pregnancy was unwelcomed.
Results
Altogether 72.8% of births were planned and wel-
comed, 4.9% were planned but unwelcomed, 10.5% were 
unplanned but welcomed and 11.8% were unplanned and 
unwelcomed (Table 1).
Sociodemographic factors related to pregnancy planning 
and acceptance
Women with unplanned pregnancies were younger, less 
likely to be cohabiting, less educated, and more likely to 
be low income and receive government health insurance 
for low-income individuals than women with planned 
pregnancies. These sociodemographic differences were 
particularly evident for women who had unplanned and 
unwelcomed pregnancies, with women in this category 
more likely to have migrated from Sub-Saharan Africa 
(Table 1). Women with unplanned pregnancies were also 
more likely to include the following factors: higher parity, 
a history of abortion and a pre-pregnancy condition that 
heightened their risk of maternal morbidity. Multivariate 
analysis supported most of the previous associations indi-
cating fewer differences between planned/welcomed and 
planned/unwelcomed pregnancies than between planned/
welcomed and unplanned/welcomed pregnancies (Table 2).
Maternal psychological distress and health care seeking
Altogether, 24.0% of women reported feeling sad, 
depressed or hopeless, and 15.5% indicated a loss 
of interest in most things, for at least two consecu-
tive weeks of pregnancy, while 12.5% presented both 
depressive symptoms (Table  3). They are described in 
the remainder of the article as presenting with depres-
sive symptoms during pregnancy. In addition, 10.1% of 
mothers perceived they had poor psychological health 
during pregnancy. Altogether, 4.5% reported depressive 
symptoms and perceived poor psychological health.
Few women (6.4%) consulted a health professional for 
psychological problems (Table  4). Women with depres-
sive symptoms were more likely to have consulted (18.6% 
versus 7.5% for women who did not present both depres-
sive symptoms, P < 0.001), although most did not (results 
not shown). The same was true for women who perceived 
poor psychological health during pregnancy (19.2% ver-
sus 7.9%, P < 0.001). Altogether, 28.4% of women who 
perceived poor psychological health and reported two 
depressive symptoms had consulted a health professional 
for psychological problems during the pregnancy.
Poor perceived psychological health and depressive 
symptoms were more common among the youngest 
and oldest mothers, among higher parity women and 
among women who had a history of induced abortion 
(Table  3). Women from socially disadvantaged back-
grounds, including women who were foreign-born, less 
educated and lower income, were also more likely to 
perceive poor psychological health and report depres-
sive symptoms during pregnancy.
Psychological distress according to pregnancy planning 
and acceptance
Perceived poor psychological health varied according to 
pregnancy planning and acceptance, ranging from 7.5% 
among those who had planned/welcomed pregnancies 
to 24.1% among those who had unplanned/unwelcomed 
pregnancies (Table  4). Likewise, feelings of sadness for 
two consecutive weeks during the course of the pregnancy 
ranged from 20.6 to 39.2% while loss of interest doubled 
from 15.7 to 30.7%, according to pregnancy planning and 
acceptance. Ultimately, having both depressive symptoms 
ranged from 10.3 to 22.4%. The same increase was noted 
among women who both perceived poor psychological 
health and depressive symptoms, rising from 3.2 to 11.9% 
according to pregnancy planning and acceptance.

health, depressive symptoms or both among women 
with unplanned/unwelcomed pregnancies relative to 
women with planned/welcomed pregnancies, adjusted 
odds ratios ranging from 1.58 (CI 1.41–1.77) to 2.97 
(CI 2.36–3.73) depending on the outcome (Table  4). 
Women with planned/unwelcomed pregnancies had 
elevated odds of perceived poor psychological health 
compared to women with planned/welcomed pregnan-
cies with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.73 (CI 
1.48–2.02) to 2.11 (CI 1.47–3.03).
When selecting women who reported unplanned 
pregnancies, we also found greater odds of perceived 
poor psychological health across all indicators among 
women with unwelcomed pregnancies relative to those 
who had welcomed pregnancies, with adjusted odds 
ratios ranging from 1.49 (CI 1.27–1.74) to 2.63 (CI 
1.85–3.72).
Maternal psychological distress according to pregnancy 
planning
In contrast to previous findings, we found no differ-
ences in depressive symptoms (aOR = 0.99 (CI 0.82–
1.19)) and only slightly elevated odds of perceived 
poor psychological health (aOR = 1.25 (CI 1.03–1.53)) 
according to pregnancy planning status among women 
who had welcomed pregnancies (result not shown). 
There were no differences in perceived poor psycho-
logical health or depressive symptoms reported alone, 
according to pregnancy planning among women who 
had unwelcomed pregnancies; although the odds 
of reporting both were higher when women had an 
unplanned pregnancy (aOR = 1.48 (CI 1.01–2.16)) 
(Table 4).
Care seeking according to pregnancy planning 
and acceptance
Finally, women with unwelcomed pregnancies were more 
likely to have consulted a health professional for psycho-
logical problems compared to women with welcomed 
pregnancies, regardless of pregnancy planning status, 
while women with unplanned/welcomed pregnancy were 
as likely to consult than women with planned/welcomed 
pregnancies (Table 4).
Discussion
Our results show that unplanned births account for 
almost one in four live births in France, but half are well 
accepted based on women’s reaction to the timing of the 
pregnancy. Pregnancy acceptance was strongly related to 
antenatal psychological symptoms, as women who expe-
rienced unwelcomed pregnancies had about twice the 
odds of reporting perceived poor psychological health 
and presenting with two depressive symptoms for at least 
two consecutive weeks during pregnancy, compared to 
women with planned/welcomed pregnancies, with little 
effect of planning status, even after adjusting for socio-
demographic and medical factors. This increased risk 
was not observed among women whose unplanned preg-
nancies were well accepted.
Our findings are consistent with previous reports of 
the association between pregnancy intentions and mater-
nal mental health distress, while further specifying the 
relationship which mostly depends on acceptability of 
pregnancy timing rather than on pregnancy planning. In 
support of Aiken and al.’s framework [16], we found that 
women with low pregnancy acceptance were more likely 
to experience psychological distress compared to women 
who responded positively to the timing of pregnancy 
whether planned or not. These results are in line with 
Lancaster et al. and Abajobir et al.’s systematic reviews, 
albeit using different pregnancy intention measures [9, 
10]. Specifically, our measure of unplanned and unwel-
comed pregnancy most closely mimics the association 
reported between unwanted pregnancies and maternal 
depression in Abajobir et  al.’s meta-analysis [10]. How-
ever, our distinction between unplanned/welcomed and 
unplanned/unwelcomed pregnancy provides additional 
insights on the importance of women’s reaction to the 
pregnancy, confirming prior work among smaller con-
venience samples, suggesting that pregnancy acceptabil-
ity matters more than planning [17, 18].
While the directionality of the association cannot be 
established in our study, especially as we have no infor-
mation about pre-pregnancy mental health history, the 
relevance of pregnancy acceptability as a marker of risk 
for maternal mental distress remains critical both from 
a public health and clinical perspective. This is espe-
cially pertinent as depression during pregnancy is a com-
mon source of maternal morbidity and is associated with 
increased risk of postpartum depression [22], and adverse 
perinatal and child health [12, 13]. A pooled estimated 
prevalence based on meta-regression data from 101 stud-
ies evaluates the prevalence of perinatal depression at 
11.4% in high-income countries [23]. This estimate rises 
to 21% among women with an unintended pregnancy 
according to Abajobir et  al.’s meta-analysis [10]. Thus, 
monitoring and supporting the health and social needs of 
women with low pregnancy acceptability who tend to pre-
sent with depressive symptoms early in pregnancy [24], 
can enhance medical practice by improving early detec-
tion and care of maternal depression. Such interventions 
are needed to reduce unmet need for maternal psycholog-
ical support, which could be substantial, as suggested by 
our study showing that only 28% of women who perceived

poor psychological health and reported two depressive 
symptoms during pregnancy had consulted a healthcare 
provider for their psychological concerns.
The present study has a number of limitations that 
should be considered when interpreting the results. The 
multi-thematic nature of the National Perinatal Survey, 
destined to monitor key national perinatal indicators 
and compliance with clinical guidelines, prevented the 
inclusion of a number of validated multi-item measures 
to reduce interview time. As an alternative, we assessed 
pregnancy planning and acceptance using two questions 
that are routinely discussed during clinical encounters 
rather than the more comprehensive London Measure 
of Unintended Pregnancy, which includes six questions 
[25] . While our indicator of pregnancy acceptance does 
not capture the complexities of women’s emotional reac-
tions to a pregnancy [16], we nonetheless were able to 
discern different perspectives on pregnancy that are 
salient to inform a women-centered approach to preg-
nancy care. Measurement concerns extend to maternal 
psychological health, as this secondary analysis did not 
use diagnostic measures of mental health such as the 
World Mental Health Composite International Diagnos-
tic Interview (CIDI) v2.1 [26], nor did it use validated 
measures of depressive symptoms, mostly evaluated 
using questionnaire scales [27], such as the widely used 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [28] or the Patient 
health Questionnaire (PHQ9) scale [29] (from which our 
2 items of depression were extracted). These scales com-
prise more items than could be integrated in the Perina-
tal survey for the same reasons specified for pregnancy 
intentions measures. In addition, our retrospective 
measures do not relate to a specific timing during preg-
nancy and are therefore unable to capture the chang-
ing prevalence of antepartum depression [27]. While 
we acknowledge that these limitations are potential 
threats to the internal validity of our findings, our assess-
ment of depressive symptoms (combining two modi-
fied PHQ2 items) during pregnancy are in the range 
of maternal depressing symptoms estimates using the 
PHQ9 measure [29] or mood disorders evaluated using 
CIDI interviews among postpartum women enrolled in 
the National Comorbidity Survey [30]. In addition, our 
reported associations with pregnancy intentions are con-
sistent with previous studies, showing a doubling of the 
odds of poor psychological health among women with 
unwanted pregnancy [10]. Our results are also consistent 
across our indicators, whether we consider the presence 
of two depressive symptoms, perceived poor psycho-
logical health alone, or both. The cross-sectional design 
and timing of the survey may also introduce recall bias 
and post-rationalization of pregnancy intentions. Stud-
ies have shown that pregnancy acceptability can change, 
with unintended pregnancies reclassified as intended 
after the birth of a child [31]. Such reclassification is 
likely to impact the association between pregnancy 
acceptability and mental distress if reclassification differs 
by mental distress status. Temporality of exposure and 
outcome is also a concern as we were not able to adjust 
for women’s pre-pregnancy mental health history, which 
is an important predictor of maternal mental health [32]. 
These limitations prevent us from making any claims 
about causality based on our findings.
Despite these limitations, this study adds to the litera-
ture, highlighting the importance of women’s acceptance 
of pregnancy timing as a correlate of maternal mental 
distress. The study has a number of strengths, including 
the use of a large representative sample of women deliv-
ering a live birth in France and the detailed information 
about women’s social and demographic background. This 
sociodemographic information addresses some of the 
limitations of previous research, allowing adjustments for 
multiple social confounders of the relation between preg-
nancy intentions and maternal mental distress. However, 
confounding may still exist in this observational study, 
including for example life events happening after the plan-
ning of the pregnancy that may affect pregnancy accept-
ance and women’s mental distress. We believe our results 
provide empirical evidence of the heterogeneous link-
ages between pregnancy intentions and maternal health 
distress, drawing attention to the concept of pregnancy 
acceptability rather than planning as a critical marker of 
maternal risk that can be used in clinical practice to tai-
lor healthcare and social services for women at higher risk 
of experiencing psychological distress during pregnancy. 
We suggest future research should revisit the association 
between pregnancy acceptability and antenatal/post-
partum depression using a longitudinal design and diag-
nostic or validated psychometric measures of depressive 
symptoms to evaluate how pregnancy acceptability at the 
beginning of the pregnancy, or in the course of pregnancy, 
relates to and predicts maternal mental health, while also 
identifying barriers to mental health care, which may be 
prevalent based on our preliminary results.
Conclusion
Our findings specify the relationship between pregnancy 
intentions and maternal psychological health, which 
mostly depends on the acceptance of pregnancy timing 
rather than on pregnancy planning. A holistic assessment 
and response to women’s health and social needs during 
pregnancy are critical in reducing unmet need for psy-
chological care, which we found to be high in our study 
and to address social inequalities in women’s pregnancy 
experiences and outcomes.
