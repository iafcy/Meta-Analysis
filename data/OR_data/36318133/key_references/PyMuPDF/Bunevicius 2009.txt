Abstract
Objective. To assess the prevalence of antenatal depressive disorder in different trimesters and to evaluate the relation of
psychosocial risk factors to antenatal depressive disorder. Design. Cohort follow-up. Setting. University Hospital, Kaunas,
Lithuania. Sample. Two hundred and thirty pregnant women consecutively admitted. Methods. At 1216 weeks, 2226
weeks, and 3236 weeks of pregnancy, participants were screened for depression using the World Health Organization’s
Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF). Women who gave at least one positive answer to the
CIDI-SF depression-screening question were evaluated for depressive disorder using the non-patient version of the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID-NP). Psychosocial stressors and two Big Five Personality dimensions,
neuroticism and extraversion, were also evaluated. Main outcome measures. Prevalence of depressive disorder. Results. The
prevalence of the antenatal depressive disorder at 1216 weeks’ gestation was 6.1%, at 2226 weeks 3.5%, and at 3236
weeks 4.4%. In the first trimester, a greater prevalence of current depressive disorder was independently associated with
unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, high neuroticism, low education, and a previous history of depression; in the second
trimester with unplanned and unwanted pregnancy and high neuroticism; in the third trimester with unplanned and
unwanted pregnancy, high neuroticism, and the occurrence of psychosocial stressors during the last year. Conclusions. The
highest prevalence of depressive disorders was found in the first trimester, the lowest in mid-pregnancy. Several
determinants (unwanted and unplanned pregnancy, high neuroticism) were independent predictors of antenatal depressive
disorders throughout whole pregnancy, while other determinants (low education, previous history of depression, the
occurrence of psychosocial stressors at the end of pregnancy) were trimester specific.

Introduction
Psychiatric disorders, particularly mood and anxiety
disorders, have the highest prevalence in women
during childbearing years (1). A meta-analysis of 59
studies found an increased rate of onset of depres-
sion in pregnancy and in the postpartum period (2).
Evidence suggests that postpartum depression can
be part of a continuum, with onset of illness during
pregnancy (3). A longitudinal cohort study showed
that depressive symptoms are actually more common
during gestation than in the postpartum period (4).
The study by Gaynes et al. indicated that up to 11%
of women suffer from major or minor depression
during gestation (5).

Depression during pregnancy can have serious
implications for all family members. Relationship
conflicts, decreased ability to care for other children
and loss of employment are examples. Uncontrolled
maternal depression puts the developing fetus at
harm due to substance abuse, poor prenatal care and
suicide attempts (6). Mood and anxiety disorders
during pregnancy are associated with diminished
fetal wellbeing, poor obstetric outcomes, including
birthweight, body mass index and preterm delivery
(7,8), and with persistent behavioral problems dur-
ing childhood (9). Therefore, early detection of
antenatal depression and intervention are important
clinical tasks. However, antenatally as well as post-
natally depressed women are poorly identified by
their general practitioners (10). Symptoms of de-
pressive disorder, such as disturbed sleep, appetite,
energy and interest level, may be incorrectly as-
sumed to be symptoms associated with pregnancy or
the postpartum period (11).
Studies of antenatal depression have mostly ex-
amined antenatal mood as a predictor of postnatal
depression. There have been several efforts to
develop ‘screening tools’ to predict which women
will become depressed postnatally (12). While the
predictive value of these instruments has been poor
(12), they became useful in identifying pregnant
women who are currently depressed (13). Psycho-
social risk factors that are indicators of distress
during pregnancy, such as previous negative preg-
nancy experience (e.g. miscarriages, terminations),
domestic violence, significant emotional losses prior
to age 16 or within the past year may be associated
with depressive mood during pregnancy (14,15).
Maladaptive personality traits, such as chronic
anxiety and low self-esteem (16), may also impact
depressive mood during pregnancy. Although there
is substantial evidence on the association between
specific personality dimensions, such as neuroticism
or introversion, and major depression in general and
in the postpartum period (17,18), there are no data
with regard to pregnancy. Recent reviews demon-
strate that substantial risk factors for depression
during pregnancy are a personal history of mood
and anxiety disorders, previous postpartum depres-
sion, family history of psychiatric disorders, younger
age, unplanned pregnancy, ambivalence or negative
feelings about the pregnancy, greater number of
children, substance abuse or smoking, lower educa-
tional levels, and unemployment (19).
The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence
of the current antenatal depressive disorders at
different trimesters during gestation and to evaluate
the relation between psychosocial risk factors and
antenatal depressive disorder.
Material and methods
In 2005, women who attended for antenatal care at
two antenatal clinics in Kaunas, Lithuania, were
invited to participate. All were low risk, and mid-
wives and family doctors gave antenatal care, while
according to Lithuanian antenatal care regulations,
there was an obligatory consultation with an obste-
trician twice during pregnancy. Three hundred and
seven consecutive women signed the informed con-
sent. Women who did not attend all three study
assessments (n77) were excluded from the study.
These 77 women were no different from those who
attended all assessments in terms of psychosocial
and demographic characteristics.
Data from 230 (74.9% response rate) eligible
women were thus used for the final analysis (Table
I). Age ranged from 18 to 43 years (mean 299
5 years). All women were Caucasian and fluent in
Lithuanian. None of the participating women re-
ceived biological or psychological treatment for a
depressive disorder.
The participants were interviewed three times by
the same psychiatrist (LK): at 1216, 2226, and
3236 weeks. During the first pregnancy assessment
time (1216 weeks of pregnancy), a translated ver-

Association was used to collect clinical and psycho-
social data (age, level of education, working outside
home, lifestyle habits, history of depression, history
of depression in the family, obstetrical history, as
well as was this pregnancy wanted or not) (20).
During all three pregnancy assessment times, wo-
men were screened for depression using the World
Health Organization’s Composite International Di-
agnostic Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF) (21). All
women who gave at least one positive answer to the
CIDI-SF depression screening question were admi-
nistered the detailed standard psychiatric diagnostic
assessment with the non-patient version of the
Structured
Clinical
Interview
for
DSM-III-R
(SCID-NP) (22). During all three pregnancy assess-
ment times, the occurrence of psychosocial stressors
was evaluated using the validated translation of the
DSM-III-R Severity of Psychosocial Stressors Scale
in Adults during the last year (23). At the second
assessment
time
(2226 weeks), two personality
dimensions, neuroticism
and extroversion, were
assessed using the Big Five Personality Inventory
(BFPI) (24).
The CIDI-SF was developed by the World Health
Organization from the full version of the CIDI to
screen for the most commonly occurring psychiatric
diagnoses.
A previously validated Lithuanian translation of
the SCID-NP was employed for detailed psychiatric
diagnostic assessment (25). The SCID-NP com-
prises a semi-structured clinical interview ensuring
accurate and reliable psychiatric diagnosis and con-
sists of several models designed to diagnose specific
mental disorders. We used module ‘A’ for diagnosing
mood syndromes such as major depression and
dysthymia, and module ‘I’ for diagnosing adjustment
disorder with depressive mood. Women who were
diagnosed as having current major depressive dis-
order, current dysthymia or current adjustment
disorder with depressed mood were classified as a
case.
A previously validated Lithuanian translation of
the DSM-III-R Severity of Psychosocial Stressors
Scale in Adults during last year (23) was used to
evaluate the occurrence of psychosocial stressors.
The rating of the stressor is based on the clinician’s
assessment of how an ‘average’ person in similar
circumstances and with similar sociocultural values
would experience the particular stressor(s). The
rating is based on the severity of the stressor itself,
not on the person’s vulnerability to the particular
stressor.
Subscales of neuroticism and of extraversion of the
BFPI (24) consist of eight statements each. Each
statement is scored from zero to five according to the
extent to which someone agrees or disagrees with the
listed characteristic of personality. A high neuroti-
cism
score
indicates
a tendency to experience
unpleasant emotions easily and to react more in-
tensely than normal. A low extraversion score
indicates inhibition and shyness in social interac-
tions. We used categorical classification of these
subscales. Subjects scoring higher than the mean
1 SD on the subscale of neuroticism were con-
sidered as cases with high neuroticism. Subjects
scoring lower than 1 SD below the mean on the
subscale of extraversion were considered as cases
with low extraversion. Hence, a score of ]28 on the
subscale of neuroticism was used to define high
neuroticism (n41, 17.8%), and a score of 523 on
the subscale of extraversion was used to define low
extraversion (n47, 20.4%).
The CIDI-SF and the BFPI were translated into
Lithuanian using the standard procedure of double
translation by two psychiatrists: RB and LK.
The Biomedical Research Ethics Committee at
the Kaunas University of Medicine approved this
study.
Statistical analysis
The normality of the distribution of personality
subscales
was
checked
using
the
one
sample
KolmogorovSmirnov test. Data on the psychosocial
and demographic characteristics of the subjects were
summarized using descriptive statistics. Prevalence
rates for antenatal depressive disorders during each
trimester of pregnancy were compared using McNe-
mar tests (Table II). Logistic regression analysis was
used to examine factors associated with a depressive
disorder as the dependent variable (OR, 95% CI).
Independent variables were selected based on the
data published in the literature, such as demo-
graphic, psychosocial, and personality factors. To
assess an association between psychosocial factors
and antenatal depressive disorder, first a univariate
logistic model was used. Subsequently, only those
variables that were significant in the univariate
model during different trimesters of pregnancy
were entered in a multiple logistic regression model.
All comparisons were two-way and at 5% signifi-
cance level. Analysis was performed using the
Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS).
Results
In total, 17% (n38), 11% (n26), and 11% (n
25) of women were screened positive for depressive
disorders at 1216, 2226, and 3236 weeks of
pregnancy, respectively. The prevalence rate of

clinical diagnosis of any depressive disorder was
6.1% (n14) at 1216 weeks, 3.5% (n8) at 22
26 weeks, and 4.4% (n10) at 3236 weeks of
pregnancy (Table II). In total, 17 (7.4%) women
were diagnosed as having a depressive disorder at
least once during pregnancy. Depressive disorders
consisted of major depression (14 women), adjust-
ment disorder with depressed mood (two women)
and dysthymia (one woman). The prevalence of
major depression was 5.2% (n12) at 1216 weeks,
2.6% (n6) at 2226 weeks, and 3.5% (n7) at
3236 weeks of pregnancy.
Seven of the 14 women diagnosed with a depres-
sive disorder at 1216 weeks of pregnancy recovered
without any treatment, the other seven remained
depressed during the second and third trimester of
pregnancy, also without any treatment. One of seven
women who recovered from depression reported a
non-planned pregnancy, while five of seven who did
not recover during gestation (OR: 15.0, 95% CI:
1.03; 218.3). In the second trimester of pregnancy,
one woman who was newly diagnosed as having
adjustment disorder with depressed mood, remained
depressed during the third trimester. In the third
trimester of pregnancy, two women were newly
diagnosed as having a mild episode of major depres-
sion.
In Table III, the results of a univariate logistic
regression are shown with a diagnosis of a depressive
disorder as the dependent variable. There were four
determinants significantly associated with depression
at all assessments: non-planned pregnancy, a perso-
nal history of depression in the past, a personal
history of psychiatric treatment in the past and high
neuroticism scores. During the first trimester, low
education, the occurrence of psychosocial stressors
and a family history of depression were also signifi-
cantly related to depression. Psychosocial stressors
were related to depression during the last trimester.
Smoking was related to depression at a 90% signifi-
cance level during the second and third trimesters.
The
results
of
a
multiple
logistic
regression
analysis with depression as the dependent variable
at three different trimesters of pregnancy are shown
in Table IV. In the first trimester, depression was
independently related to unplanned and unwanted
pregnancy, high neuroticism, low education and a
previous history of depression; in the second trime-
ster, depression was independently related to un-
planned
and
unwanted
pregnancy
and
high
neuroticism; in the third trimester, depression was
independently related to unplanned and unwanted
pregnancy, high neuroticism and occurrence of
psychosocial stressors during the last year.
Discussion
Our study has demonstrated that the highest pre-
valence of antenatal depressive disorders was at the
beginning of pregnancy, the lowest in mid-preg-
nancy. Unwanted und unplanned pregnancy and
high neuroticism scores were stable determinants of
antenatal depression. Furthermore, depression was
associated with low education and a previous history
of depression at the beginning of pregnancy, and
with the occurrence of psychosocial stressors at the
end of pregnancy.
A recent review of the literature on antenatal major
depression reported a point prevalence ranging from
3.1 to 4.9% at different times during pregnancy (5).
Our data on the prevalence rates of antenatal
depressive disorder are in the same range, 2.65.2%
at different trimesters of pregnancy. Our prevalence
rate data of any antenatal depressive disorder ranges
from 3.5 to 6.1% and correspond to data from other
studies. Pop et al. (20), using the CIDI as a
diagnostic instrument, reported the prevalence of
depression ranging from 5.3% during the first
trimester of pregnancy to 2.9% during the third
trimester of pregnancy. Lee et al. (26), using the
SCID-NP, reported a 6.4% prevalence of depression
in Chinese women at the 38th week of pregnancy.
The role of personality dimensions in major
depression has long been studied. Many reports
have consistently documented that personality traits,
such as high neuroticism, low extraversion, low self-
esteem, excessive self-criticism or interpersonal de-
pendency, are associated with depression in both

general and postpartum populations (18, 27). There
is ample evidence showing that, during a major
depression, the scores for neuroticism are increased.
This effect is usually attributed to the state effect of
depression (27). A recent general population-based
study of 4,796 subjects showed that personality-
related vulnerability (high levels of neuroticism,
depressive coping style and low self-esteem) was
present more than one year before the onset of the
episode of major depression, which increased further
during the episode of depression to return to
premorbid levels after full remission (28). The
authors suggest the ongoing expression of vulner-
ability as a personality deviance and synchrony of
change between severity of depressive symptoms and
personality deviance. Our study is the first to
examine the relation between personality and an-
tenatal depressive disorder. We found that high
neuroticism but not low extraversion was signifi-
cantly associated with depression during each trime-
ster of pregnancy. This is in accordance with results
from previous studies in the general population (27)
and in postpartum women (18).
Pregnancy and birth itself are often regarded as
stressful life events possibly leading to depression
(28). The relation between life events, vulnerability
to stress and the onset of depression is well estab-
lished in a psychiatric population. In this study, we
found that stressful life events, such as unwanted and
unplanned pregnancy, were associated with depres-
sive disorder through all trimesters of pregnancy.
Pakenhalm et al. (29) reported that during the third
trimester of pregnancy, higher rates of depression are
related to higher reports of stressful life events.
These findings correspond with our data showing
that an association between depression and psycho-
social stressors in the third trimester of gestation is
not limited to unwanted pregnancy and covers other
psychosocial stressors as well.
We found lower education to be an independent
risk factor of depression at early pregnancy, which has
also been described in other studies (19). Lower
education is frequently related to lower socioeco-
nomic status, which is also a risk factor for depression.
Smoking and depression were related at a 90%
significance level in the second and third trimesters
of pregnancy. Others also report a relation between
smoking and depression (30). The fact that this
relation in the current study was not significant at a
95% level is mainly explained by the low number of
women who smoked during gestation. According to
the Lithuanian National Birth Register for the year
2006, before pregnancy 8.3% of women reported
smoking and during pregnancy 5% reported smok-
ing (31). The lower prevalence of smokers found in
our study might suggest that the more vulnerable
women did not participate in the study. A high
prevalence of alcohol intake might be explained by
women being considered as alcohol consumers if
they used at least one drink of alcohol during
pregnancy, according to Dutch Royal Midwifery
Association interview format used.
A limitation of the study is the relatively small
sample. Another limitation is the lack of a control
group of non-pregnant women. Moreover, biological
determinants of depression, such as thyroid dysfunc-
tion and immunity (20), and certain social factors,
such as domestic violence and use of narcotics, were
also not evaluated in this report.
The strengths of this study are its prospective
design, the fact that one psychiatrist performed the
psychiatric evaluation using standardized instru-
ments (including syndromal diagnoses of psychiatric
disorders) and that personality traits such as neuroti-
cism and extroversion were evaluated.
Until recently, researchers and health care provi-
ders have especially focused on recognizing and
treating depression during the postnatal period.
However, unrecognized and untreated antenatal
depression also has a negative impact on the well-
being of the fetus and mother. Therefore, it is
important to diagnose and treat depression in
pregnancy. A better understanding of the factors
that increase the risk of developing antenatal depres-
sion may contribute to achieving this goal.
