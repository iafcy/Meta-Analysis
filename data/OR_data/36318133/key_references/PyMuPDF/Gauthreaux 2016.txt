Abstract
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a form of major depressive disorder affecting approximately 13% of women worldwide. Unintended
pregnancies, reaching close to 50% of the pregnancies in the United States, have become a major health concern. While many
physiologic and psychosocial causes have been analyzed, few studies have examined the relationship between unintended
pregnancy and symptoms of PPD.
A cross-sectional study was conducted using surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Pregnancy
Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) from 2009 to 2011. The PRAMS population-based random sample included women
who have had recent live births and is representative of 78% of the United States population. The chi-squared test was used to
examine bivariate associations. Binary logistic regression was utilized to study unadjusted and adjusted associations between PPD
and pregnancy intendedness, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics of mothers in the sample. Multicollinearity in
the adjusted model was evaluated using variance inﬂation factors. Sampling weights were used to account for PRAMS’ complex
sampling design.
Of the 110,231 mothers included in the sample, only 32.3% reported desiring the pregnancy at the time of conception. Women
with pregnancies categorized as mistimed: desired sooner, mistimed: desired later, or unwanted were 20% (adjusted odds ratio
[AOR]=1.2; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 1.1–1.3), 30% (AOR=1.3; 95% CI: 1.2–1.4), and 50% (AOR=1.5; 95% CI: 1.3–1.7) more
likely to experience symptoms of PPD, respectively, compared to women with desired pregnancies. Other factors found to be
associated with experiencing symptoms of PPD were a gestational age of <27 weeks (AOR=3.1; 95% CI: 2.5–4.0), having a
previous history of depression (AOR=1.8; 95% CI: 1.6–2.0), and being abused during or before pregnancy (AOR=1.6; 95% CI:
1.4–2.0).
We found that women with mistimed or unwanted pregnancies were more likely to experience symptoms of PPD. Our ﬁndings
support the current US Preventive Services Task Force and American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations for an integrated
approach to screening for depression, aiding in the maximization of intervention and early referral for women at risk for PPD.

1. Introduction
Postpartum depression (PPD), or depression experienced after
pregnancy, is a serious illness that puts the well-being of both
mother and baby at risk. It is highly prevalent among new mothers,
affecting nearly 13% of women.[1] It is also a highly stigmatized
condition, although recent high-proﬁle cases have drawn signiﬁ-
cant media attention to the issue. Given its stigmatized nature,
as well as both the short-term and long-term implications for
mother and child, effective screening for PPD by general medical
practitioners is an essential public health intervention.
PPD is a term that has suffered from lack of clarity and is not
clearly operationally deﬁned. The 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) utilizes a
broader term of peripartum depression, encompassing depression
in which the onset occurred during or within the ﬁrst 4 weeks of
pregnancy, as a form of major depressive disorder. A person who
suffers from a major depressive episode must either have a
depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities
consistently for at least a 2-week period. A major depressive
episode is also characterized by the presence of 5 or more of these
symptoms: a depressed mood; markedly diminished interest or
pleasure in all, or almost all, activities; signiﬁcant unintentional
weight loss or gain; insomnia or hypersomnia; agitation or
psychomotor retardation; fatigue or loss of energy; feelings of
worthlessness or excessive guilt; diminished ability to think,
concentrate, or make decisions; and recurrent thoughts of
death.[2] However, within primary care settings, it is likely not
possible to make a formal diagnosis of peripartum depression.
For primary care physicians, obstetricians, and pediatricians
working with new mothers, attention should be paid to screening
for potential symptoms of PPD, such as feeling depressed,
hopeless, or slowed down, so that appropriate referrals for
mental health services can be made.
Unintended pregnancy is also a serious public health concern in
the United States, which has rates higher than most other
industrialized nations. It has been estimated that nearly half of all
pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and poorer
women are disproportionately affected.[3] Women who experi-
ence unintended pregnancies are less likely to receive adequate
prenatal care or breastfeed, and are more likely to engage in
unhealthy activities during pregnancy and have low birth weight
babies.[3]
Unintended
pregnancies
are
described
as
either
unwanted or mistimed. An unwanted pregnancy is deﬁned as
occurring when no children or no additional children are wanted
by the mother. Mistimed pregnancies include those occurring
earlier or later than desired.[3,4]
While many physiologic and psychosocial causes of PPD have
been explored, few studies have examined the relationship
between pregnancy intendedness and experiencing symptoms of
PPD.[5–12] To our knowledge, no such national studies within the
United States have been conducted. The aim of this study was to
investigate the association between pregnancy intendedness and
symptoms of PPD. We explored this association using a
nationally representative sample available from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s Pregnancy Risk Assessment
Monitoring System (PRAMS).[13]
2. Methods
2.1. Study design
This secondary data analysis utilized data from PRAMS.[13]
PRAMS uses a complex survey design in order to capture
adequate information from high-risk populations.[14] Forty states
and New York City participate in the annual survey, representing
78% of live births in the United States.[13] All women with live
births within the surveillance period are eligible for inclusion.
Data collected from 2009 to 2011 using the PRAMS Phase 6
Core Questionnaire were included in this study.[15]
Pregnancy intendedness was measured by participants’ answers
to the question, “Thinking back to just before you got pregnant
with your new baby, how did you feel about becoming pregnant?”
Following the deﬁnitions utilized by Finer and Zolna,[3] pregnancy
intendedness for those answering “I wanted to be pregnant then”
was categorized as Desired; “I wanted to be pregnant sooner” as
mistimed: desired sooner; “I wanted to be pregnant later” as
mistimed: desired later; and “I did not want to be pregnant then or
at any time in the future” as unwanted. The outcome of interest was
deﬁned by participants’ answers to survey questions related to self-
assessed experience with symptoms of PPD. Women were asked if
after the birth of their child they felt any of the following symptoms:
down, depressed, or sad; hopeless; or slowed down. If the
respondent indicated they had experienced any of the 3 symptoms,
they were asked to rate the frequency of experiencing the feeling as
never, rarely, sometimes, often, or always.[15] Women indicating
they sometimes, often, or always experienced any of these
symptoms were classiﬁed as experiencing symptoms of PPD; those
indicating they rarely or never experienced all 3 symptoms were
classiﬁed as not having PPD. Although the DSM-5 utilizes the
broader term of peripartum depression, this study focused solely on
depression arising after delivery, excluding women whose depres-
sion started prior to delivery.[2]
Potential confounders included maternal age (<20, 20–34, and
≥35 years); ethnicity (Hispanic and non-Hispanic); race (White,
Black, and other); marital status (married and unmarried);
total annual household income (<$10,000, $10,000–$19,999,
$20,000–$49,999, and >$50,000); level of education (less than
high school, high school, and more than high school); gestational age
at birth (<28, 28–33, 34–36, and ≥37 weeks); medical history of
depression (no and yes); abuse during or before pregnancy (no and
yes);andpresenceofstressorsinthemother’slife(none,1–2stressors,
3–5 stressors, and 6 or more stressors). Stressors included: having an
ill family member; separation or divorce from partner; recent move;
homelessness; respondent lost a job; partner lost a job; arguing with
partner more than usual; partner did not desire pregnancy; unable to
pay bills; being in a physical ﬁght; respondent or partner went to jail;
someone close to the respondent had a problem with drugs or
drinking; or someone close to the respondent died.
2.2. Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics included examining frequency distributions
of the categorical variables and assessing for missing data. We
examined bivariate associations using the chi-squared test. Binary
logistic regression was utilized to study unadjusted and adjusted
associations between PPD and pregnancy intendedness, as well as
other demographic and clinical characteristics of mothers in the
sample. The adjusted model included maternal age, ethnicity,
race, marital status, total household income, level of education,
gestational age, medical history of depression, abuse during or
before pregnancy, and the presence of stressors in the mother’s
life. Multicollinearity in the adjusted model was evaluated using
variance inﬂation factors. Sampling weights were used to account
for PRAMS’ complex sampling design.[14] A P value < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant, and 95% conﬁdence intervals
(CIs) were used to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of estimated

3. Results
Among the 112,358 women who completed the PRAMS Phase 6
Core Questionnaire, 110,231 provided information related to
pregnancy intendedness and were included in this study. Table 1
describes the demographic and clinical characteristics of mothers
included in the sample by pregnancy intendedness. Of these, 32.3%
had pregnancies categorized as desired; 17.5% had pregnancies
categorized as mistimed: desired sooner; 40.1% had pregnancies
categorized as mistimed: desired later; and 10.1% had pregnancies
categorized as unwanted. All characteristics showed a statistically
signiﬁcant relationship with pregnancy intendedness. Women with
pregnancies categorized as mistimed: desired later or unwanted
were more likely to be unmarried (P<0.001), have a total
household income of <$10,000 (P<0.001), have an education
level of high school or less (P<0.001), have a medical history of
depression (P<0.001), report a history of abuse (P<0.001), and
have more stressors (P<0.001).

Table 2 shows the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (AORs)
for PPD among mothers surveyed by PRAMS from 2009 to 2011.
No multicollinearity was observed in the adjusted model. With
any incongruence between intention of pregnancy and time of
conception, women were more likely to experience symptoms
of PPD; this association remained even after adjustment for
confounding variables. Women with pregnancies categorized as
mistimed: desired sooner, mistimed: desired later, or unwanted
had 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1–1.3), 1.3 (95% CI: 1.2–1.4), and 1.5 (95%
CI: 1.3–1.7) times the odds of experiencing symptoms of PPD,
respectively, compared to women with desired pregnancies.
Other factors found to be associated with experiencing symptoms
of PPD were a gestational age of <28 weeks (AOR=3.1; 95% CI:
2.5–4.0), having a previous history of depression (AOR=1.8;
95% CI: 1.6–2.0), and being abused during or before pregnancy
(AOR=1.6; 95% CI: 1.4–2.0). A dose effect of the number of
stressors on the increased odds of PPD symptoms was observed
after adjustment. Having 1 to 2 stressors increased the odds of
PPD symptoms by half (AOR=1.5; 95% CI: 1.4–1.7), 3 to 5
stressors more than doubled the odds (AOR=2.5; 95% CI:
2.2–2.7), and 6 or more stressors quadrupled the odds (AOR=
4.1;
95%
CI:
3.4–5.0).

>$50,000 had 1.3 times the odds of experiencing symptoms of
PPD compared to women with household income <$10,000
(AOR=1.3; 95% CI: 1.1–1.5). Unmarried women were less
likely to experience symptoms of PPD (AOR=0.9; 95% CI:
0.8–0.9). Black women and women of other race were also less
likely to experience symptoms of PPD (AOR=0.7; 95% CI:
0.6–0.7 and AOR=0.9; 95% CI: 0.8–0.95, respectively).
Maternal age of 35 years or older had a borderline signiﬁcant
association with experiencing symptoms of PPD (AOR=1.2;
95% CI: 1.0–1.4).
4. Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate the association between
pregnancy intendedness and experiencing symptoms of PPD.
While other potential risk factors have been investigated, in our
review of the literature we found only a few studies exploring the
relationship between pregnancy intendedness and symptoms of
PPD. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study utilizing a national
sample to explore pregnancy intendedness as a possible risk factor
for PPD symptoms. We found a signiﬁcant association between
pregnancy intendedness and PPD symptoms, even after adjusting
for several confounders. Women with pregnancies categorized as
mistimed: desired sooner, mistimed: desired later, and unwanted
had 1.2, 1.3, and 1.5 times the odds of experiencing symptoms of
depression,respectively.Ourresultsdrawattentiontothe potential
importance of targeted approaches to screen for PPD in women
with mistimed or unwanted pregnancies.
Our ﬁndings were similar to those of Iranfar et al, Karacam et al,
and Cortés-Salim et al, who evaluated pregnancy intendedness as a
riskfactorfor PPDinIran, Turkey, and Mexico, respectively.[16–18]
Iranfar et al found that Iranian women who had unintended
pregnancies were at higher risk for PPD compared to women with
intended pregnancies.[16] Likewise, Karacam et al observed that
Turkish women with unplanned pregnancies experienced a greater
number of psychiatric disorders during the early postpartum
period compared to those with planned pregnancies, and Cortés-
Salim et al reported that women with unplanned pregnancies had
higher rates of psycho-emotional disorders compared to those who
did not.[17,18]
Beck et al and Robertson et al determined that prenatal
depression was a predictor of PPD.[7,9] This study lends further
support to that ﬁnding; women with a history of depression were
approximately twice as likely to suffer from symptoms of PPD
when compared to those without a history of depression.
Similarly to Robertson et al, we discovered that as the number of
stressors increased, the odds of PPD symptoms increased.[9] In
respect to maternal age, our study supports the ﬁndings of
McGuinness et al, who concluded that although not a sole risk
factor, maternal age is associated with many challenges in
pregnancy which may lead to a higher incidence of PPD.[12]
Additionally, our ﬁndings were congruent with those of Beck
et al, who found 13 signiﬁcant predictors of PPD, including
unplanned/unwanted pregnancy, prenatal depression, life stress,
and social support.[7] Our ﬁnding that women who were
unmarried were slightly less likely to experience symptoms of
PPD warrants further investigation. Other studies have examined
the quality of the marital relationship as a contributing factor to
PPD.[9,19] Our ﬁnding may be explained, at least in part, by the
fact that we were unable to control for relationship quality. The
ﬁndings that women of Black and other race had decreased odds
of experiencing symptoms of PPD and that higher household
income increased the odds is contrary to ﬁndings in other
studies.[7,20] Complex factors such as awareness and cultural
acceptability of reporting symptoms related to PPD may help to
explain these ﬁndings but were beyond the scope of this analysis,
thus requiring further investigation.[21]
One strength of our study is the use of PRAMS data, which was
collected in a systematic, standardized manner, and provided a
large sample size representative of 78% of live births in the United
States.[13] To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study in the literature
to utilize PRAMS data to explore the association between
pregnancy intendedness and experiencing symptoms of PPD on a
national level. Possible limitations include the risk of recall and
social desirability bias among respondents, as well as the cross-
sectional nature of the data collected. Additionally, the extent to
which stressors affected an individual respondent is unknown;
PRAMS does not collect information that would help clarify the
complicated relationship between the effects of stress on an
individual. For this reason, we were unable to weight stressors
based on their level of severity for each respondent. Furthermore,
our operational deﬁnition for symptoms of PPD, based on the
frequency the symptoms were experienced, may limit generaliz-
ability. To improve screening procedures, future research may
include determination of the threshold for the number and
frequency of self-reported symptoms that should be considered
indicative of the presence of PPD, with appropriate analysis of
sensitivity and speciﬁcity when comparing to the gold standard of
formal psychiatric diagnosis.
We found that women with mistimed or unwanted pregnancies
were more likely to experience symptoms of PPD. Our ﬁndings
encourage physician evaluation of pregnancy intendedness
during the patient’s prenatal and postpartum ofﬁce visits. This
recommendation is relevant to primary care physicians, obste-
tricians, and pediatricians who are likely to come in contact with
mothers frequently in the weeks following birth. Our ﬁndings
support the current US Preventive Services Task Force and
American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations for an
integrated approach to screening for depression with the ultimate
goal of intervention and early referral for women at risk for PPD,
as well as highlight the need for a quick and accurate diagnostic
tool for early detection of PPD.[22–24] Given the potential physical
and psychological impact of PPD on both mother and child,
particularly for those with low levels of social support, adequate
screening for symptoms of PPD is a public health imperative.
