Objective: This study examines whether unintended pregnancy is associated with physical
abuse of women occurring around the time of pregnancy, independent of other factors.
Methods: In 1996–1997, state-speciﬁc population-based data were obtained from the Preg-
nancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) from 39,348 women in 14 states who
had delivered a live-born infant within the previous 2–6 months. The study questionnaire
asked about maternal behaviors and characteristics around the time of pregnancy. Results:
Women who had mistimed or unwanted pregnancies reported signiﬁcantly higher levels of
abuse at any time during the 12 months before conception or during pregnancy (12.6% and
15.3%, respectively) compared with those with intended pregnancies (5.3%). Higher rates
of abuse were reported by women who were younger, Black, unmarried, less educated, on
Medicaid, living in crowded conditions, entering prenatal care late, or smoking during the
third trimester. Overall, women with unintended pregnancies had 2.5 times the risk of
experiencing physical abuse compared with those whose pregnancies were intended. This
association was modiﬁed by maternal characteristics; the association was strongest among
women who were older, more educated, White, married, not on Medicaid, not living in
crowded conditions, receiving ﬁrst trimester prenatal care, or nonsmoking during the third
trimester. Conclusions: Women with unintended pregnancies are at increased risk of physical
abuse around the time of pregnancy compared with women whose pregnancies are intended.
Prenatal care can provide an important point of contact where women can be screened for
violence and referred to services that can assist them.

INTRODUCTION
Violence against women has become recognized
as an issue of clinical and public health importance.
An estimated 1.5 million adult women (1.5% of
women aged 18 years) are physically or sexually
assaulted by an intimate partner in the United States
each year (1). Women in their peak childbearing

years are at higher risk for experiencing violence by
intimate partners (2). These ﬁndings have prompted
researchers to examine the possible association be-
tween violence and pregnancy. A review of 11 studies
examining violence during pregnancy indicates that
the prevalence of violence during pregnancy ranges
from 0.9% to 20.1%; most of the studies report rates
between 3.9% and 8.3% (3). These data suggest that
violence may be a more common problem for preg-
nant women than preeclampsia and gestational dia-
betes, conditions for which pregnant women are rou-
tinely screened.
Unintended pregnancy is another public health
problem affecting a large number of women each
year in the United States. It is estimated that between
1990 and 1995, 31% of births to U.S. women aged
15–44 years were the result of an unintended concep-
tion (22% mistimed and 9% unwanted) (4). When
pregnancies ending in induced abortion are taken
into account, it is estimated that in 1994, almost half
(49%) of pregnancies to women aged 15–44 years
were unintended (5). Among women having a live
birth, unintended pregnancy has been associated with
risk factors that can affect the mother and baby, such
as lower likelihood of recognizing early signs of preg-
nancy, and greater likelihood of delayed entry into
prenatal care (6).
Among seven published studies on violence
against women that have included unintended preg-
nancy as an analysis variable, only two have speciﬁ-
cally focused on the association between unintended
pregnancy and abuse (7, 8). Others have included
unintended pregnancy as one of a number of factors
that could be associated with an increased likelihood
of experiencing violence (9–13). Although ﬁndings
from these studies are not easily comparable because
different study populations and methodologies were
used, four found that women who reported having
experienced abuse during pregnancy were also more
likely to report that their pregnancy was unintended
(8, 10, 12, 13) or that they were unhappy about being
pregnant (9, 12).
Despite these indications of a possible associa-
tion between violence and unintended pregnancy,
few studies have speciﬁcally examined the potential
causal relationship, causal pathways, or temporal re-
lationship (i.e., the extent to which unintended preg-
nancy precedes violence or vice versa). Two studies
of women seeking elective abortion indicated that in
some cases unintended pregnancy resulted directly
from physical violence that included forced inter-
course (14, 15). Researchers have also hypothesized
that physical violence may occur after an unintended
conception due to unhappiness about the pregnancy,
stress associated with an unexpected life change (7),
or disagreement between partners about what to do
about the pregnancy (14, 15). It has also been posited
that unintended pregnancy may result indirectly from
abused women’s inability to control the timing of
sexual relations or to negotiate contraception with
their partners (7). These theories, however, have not
been tested empirically.
Given the large number of women who seek
prenatal care and other reproductive health care ser-
vices each year, providers in this area are in a key
position to act as vital points of contact for identifying
and assisting women who experience abuse. A better
understanding of the relationship between unin-
tended pregnancy and violence can help inform clini-
cians and other health care professionals about po-
tential reproductive health risk factors associated
with abuse. The purpose of this analysis is to explore
the potential association between physical abuse and
unintended pregnancy in a population-based sample
of women who have recently given birth. The study
examines the association between unintended preg-
nancy and violence during the 12 months before con-
ception and during the pregnancy, while controlling
for selected individual characteristics and pregnancy-
related factors. The population-based sample allows
us to draw conclusions that can be generalized to
other women who have recently given birth.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data on physical violence and pregnancy intend-
edness came from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment
Monitoring System (PRAMS), an ongoing, state-
based surveillance system that conducts surveillance
on maternal characteristics and behaviors before
pregnancy, during pregnancy, and during the early
postpartum period (16). This study analyzed popula-
tion-based data from 14 states that collected PRAMS
data in 1996, 1997, or both. The study sample included
1996 and 1997 data from Alabama, Alaska, Florida,
Georgia, Maine, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Wash-
ington, West Virginia, and New York (excluding New
York City); 1996 data only from Michigan; and 1997
data only from Arkansas, Colorado, and North Caro-
lina (July–December only). In each state, between
100 and 250 new mothers were sampled each month
using stratiﬁed, random sampling of all resident birth
certiﬁcates. Sampled mothers were mailed a self-

administered 14-page questionnaire 2–6 months after
delivery of a live-born infant. Repeat mailings or
telephone interviews were conducted for initial non-
responders. State-speciﬁc response rates to the sur-
vey ranged from 69% to 80%. Data from individual
questionnaires were combined with birth certiﬁcate
data and weighted to adjust for selection probability,
nonresponse, and noncoverage of the sampling
frame. The resulting state-speciﬁc databases are rep-
resentative of each state’s entire population of
women delivering a live infant (17).
The PRAMS questionnaire deﬁned physical
abuse as ‘‘pushing, hitting, slapping, kicking, or any
other way of physically hurting someone.’’ Abuse
was measured by asking survey respondents whether
they were physically abused during (1) the 12 months
before they became pregnant, and (2) their most re-
cent pregnancy. For each time period, respondents
could indicate that they were physically abused by
‘‘my husband or partner, a family or household mem-
ber, a friend, someone else, or no one.’’ Women who
responded that they had been abused by ‘‘someone
else’’ were asked to specify the perpetrator. Prelimi-
nary data analysis found that more than three fourths
of abused women reported abuse by a current or
former intimate partner, and detected no statistical
differences in pregnancy intendedness among abused
women by type of perpetrator. We therefore com-
bined all women who reported abuse regardless of
relationship to the perpetrator. Of the 39,348 women
in the study sample, we excluded 1706 respondents
(4.3%) with missing or unknown responses to the
preconception violence question and the pregnancy
violence question. For our analysis, women were de-
ﬁned as ‘‘abused around the time of pregnancy’’ if
they reported abuse at any time during the 12 months
before pregnancy or during the pregnancy. Timing of
abuse was further divided into one of three mutually
exclusive categories (1) abuse only during the 12
months before pregnancy, (2) abuse only during preg-
nancy, and (3) abuse both before and during preg-
nancy. Throughout this paper, we use the term ‘‘phys-
ical abuse’’ since this terminology was used in the
PRAMS questionnaire.
Pregnancy intendedness was measured with the
question, ‘‘Thinking back to just before you were
pregnant, how did you feel about becoming preg-
nant?’’ Intendedness of the pregnancy was catego-
rized as intended (the woman wanted the pregnancy
at that time or sooner), mistimed (the woman wanted
to be pregnant later), or unwanted (the woman did
not want to be pregnant then or at any time in the
future). Because of lack of signiﬁcant differences
among women whose pregnancies were mistimed and
those whose pregnancies were unwanted, for parts
of our analysis we combined the two groups to create
a broader category of ‘‘unintended’’ pregnancies.
Women who responded ‘‘don’t know’’ or did not
reply (7.6%) were excluded from the analysis.
Throughout the paper, the term ‘‘pregnancy intend-
edness’’ refers to the intendedness of pregnancies
resulting in a live birth.
We included in our analysis individual character-
istics and behaviors identiﬁed by previous studies as
related to both violence during pregnancy (3), and
unintended pregnancy (6) (maternal age, education,
race, marital status, socioeconomic status, and mater-
nal behaviors during pregnancy). Age, education,
race, and marital status were obtained from birth
certiﬁcate data. Race was deﬁned as White, Black or
‘‘other,’’ which included Alaska Natives, American
Indians, and Asian/Paciﬁc Islanders. Marital status
was based on reported status at the time of delivery.
Information on Medicaid, household crowding, and
selected behaviors during pregnancy were obtained
from the PRAMS questionnaire data. Medicaid sta-
tus was deﬁned as having received Medicaid just be-
fore the pregnancy or having had Medicaid pay for
prenatal care or delivery. Household crowding was
deﬁned as more than one person per room, based
on the Census of Housing deﬁnition (18). Selected
maternal behaviors were (1) delayed entry into pre-
natal care (14 weeks or later) and (2) smoking during
the third trimester of pregnancy. In addition, we in-
cluded an indicator of the father’s feeling about the
pregnancy, a variable that has not been considered in
other studies and is newly available from the PRAMS
questionnaire. Women were asked whether the ba-
by’s father had at any time during the 12 months
before delivery said that he did not want her to be
pregnant.
To assess whether unintended pregnancy and
physical abuse were associated for women whose
pregnancies resulted in a live birth, we compared
pregnancy intendedness among women who did not
report abuse with the intendedness among abused
women. Prevalence of abuse was examined according
to maternal characteristics, including intendedness
of the pregnancy. We also examined the potential
association between pregnancy intendedness and
timing of the abuse in relation to the pregnancy.
Finally, we conducted a stratiﬁed analysis comparing
prevalence of abuse among women with intended
and unintended pregnancies resulting in live births

88

according to selected maternal characteristics. Risk
ratios and 95% conﬁdence intervals were calculated
to determine strength of associations and precision of
estimates when stratiﬁed by maternal characteristics.
SUDAAN (Software for Survey Data Analysis) was
used to calculate standard errors that account for
selection and response probabilities of the multistage
sampling design (19).
RESULTS
The analysis dataset included 39,348 women who
had delivered a live-born infant within the previous
2–6 months. Of these, 86% were at least 20 years of
age, 80% had completed at least 12 years of educa-
tion, and 68% were married. Seventy-seven percent
of the respondents were White, 19% were Black, and
4% were of other races. The majority of women (87%)
received prenatal care in the ﬁrst trimester. Forty-
two percent of the women reported having received
Medicaid, 11% lived in crowded conditions, and 15%
reported smoking during the third trimester of preg-
nancy. Twelve percent of the women reported that
at some time during the 12 months before the delivery
the father had said he did not want the pregnancy.
Among women who reported no abuse, over
half (58.2%) reported that at the time of conception
their pregnancy was intended, 30.9% reported their
pregnancy was mistimed, and 10.9% reported that
their pregnancy was unwanted (Table I). Combining
mistimed and unwanted pregnancies, we found that
42% of women who reported no abuse had an unin-
tended pregnancy. In contrast, among women who
had experienced abuse around the time of pregnancy
(violence at any time during 12 months before con-

that their pregnancy was intended, and 66.3% had an

the pregnancies were mistimed and 20.3% unwanted.
Overall prevalence of physical abuse around the
time of pregnancy was 8.8% (n  3494), and varied
signiﬁcantly by maternal characteristics, including in-
tendedness of the pregnancy (Table II). Among
women whose pregnancies were intended, 5.3% re-

pared with 12.6% of those whose pregnancies were

unwanted. Prevalence of abuse among women with
intended pregnancies was signiﬁcantly lower than
among those with mistimed or unwanted pregnan-
cies; there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference
in prevalence between the latter two groups. The
prevalence of physical abuse around the time of preg-
nancy was signiﬁcantly greater for women less than
20 years of age compared with those aged 20 years
and older, and signiﬁcantly higher among women
aged 20–29 years compared with women aged 30
years and older. A similar pattern of statistical sig-
niﬁcance was found by education level; those who
had completed fewer than 12 years of education had
a higher prevalence of abuse than women with more
years of education. Black women and those who were
not married at the time of delivery reported signiﬁ-
cantly higher prevalence of abuse. Prevalence of
abuse was also signiﬁcantly higher among women
who were on Medicaid, living in crowded conditions,
reported late entry into prenatal care, and smoked
during the third trimester of pregnancy. Women for
whom the baby’s father expressed that he did not
want the pregnancy also reported signiﬁcantly higher
prevalence of abuse than those for whom the father
did not state that he did not want the pregnancy.
When abuse was stratiﬁed according to timing
of abuse in relation to the pregnancy, overall, 3.2%
of women reported abuse only during the 12 months
before the pregnancy, 1.5% reported abuse only dur-
ing the pregnancy, and 4.1% reported abuse during
both time periods (Table III). Thus, almost half of
the abused women (45%) experienced abuse both
before and during pregnancy. Women with intended
pregnancies reported signiﬁcantly lower prevalence
of abuse than women who had mistimed or unwanted
pregnancies for each of the three time periods of
abuse; no signiﬁcant differences were found between
women with mistimed and unwanted pregnancies. In

addition, the timing pattern of abuse did not vary by
pregnancy intendedness. For all levels of intend-
edness, the proportion of the study population expe-
riencing abuse during both time periods was consis-
tently higher, and the proportion reporting abuse
only during the pregnancy was lower. Since preva-
lence of abuse did not vary signiﬁcantly between
women with mistimed and unwanted pregnancies,
and since timing of abuse did not vary signiﬁcantly
when stratiﬁed by intendedness, the remainder of the
analysis classiﬁes pregnancies as either (1) intended
or (2) unintended, and abuse as physical abuse
around the time of pregnancy (i.e., does not stratify
by timing of abuse).
Prevalence of abuse was signiﬁcantly higher for
women with unintended pregnancies than for women
with intended pregnancies (Table IV). When preva-
lence of abuse was stratiﬁed by pregnancy intend-
edness and maternal characteristics, we found that
both for women whose pregnancies were intended
and for those whose pregnancies were unintended,
prevalence of abuse was signiﬁcantly higher among
younger women, those with fewer years of education,
those who were unmarried, on Medicaid, living in
crowded conditions, had delayed entry into prenatal
care, and smoked during the third trimester, and for
whom the father said he did not want the pregnancy.
Abuse was statistically higher for Black women
whose pregnancies were intended compared to White
women and those of other races, but no statistical
differences were found by race among those whose
pregnancies were unintended.
When risk ratios were calculated, we found that,
overall, women with unintended pregnancies were
2.5 times more likely to have experienced abuse.
However, the association between abuse and unin-
tended pregnancy was modiﬁed by maternal charac-
teristics. The association was strongest for women

who were at least 20 years old, had 12 or more years
of education, were White, married, not on Medicaid,
not living in crowded conditions, entered prenatal
care during the ﬁrst trimester, did not smoke during
the third trimester, and for whom the father did not
state that he did not want the pregnancy. Despite the
statistical strength of the association between physi-
cal abuse and unintended pregnancy among these
women, however, they were less likely to have experi-
enced abuse than women who were younger, less
educated, Black, unmarried, on Medicaid, living in
crowded conditions, receiving delayed prenatal care,
smokers, and for whom the baby’s father stated he
did not want the pregnancy. Among these women,
prevalence of abuse was relatively high regardless of
pregnancy intendedness, and the resulting risk ratios
were either not statistically signiﬁcant or only
slightly so.
DISCUSSION
Our analysis found a relatively strong associa-
tion between unintended pregnancy and abuse. How-
ever, stratiﬁed prevalence and risk ratios showed that
maternal characteristics modiﬁed the association be-
tween unintended pregnancy and abuse. These ﬁnd-
ings are similar to those of two previous studies using
PRAMS data. In a study of the association between
unintended pregnancy and abuse using 1990–91
PRAMS data, Gazmararian et al. found that the asso-
ciation between unintended pregnancy and abuse was

Pregnancy Intendedness and Physical Abuse

modiﬁed by maternal characteristics (8). Likewise,
Dietz et al. found that women with higher socioeco-
nomic status (SES) showed a signiﬁcant association
between delayed prenatal care and abuse, whereas
women with lower SES did not (11). In the authors’
assessments, a possible explanation for these ﬁndings
was that prevalence of violence among ‘‘less advan-
taged women’’ (i.e., lower SES and higher prevalence
of risk factors for poor pregnancy outcome) was al-
ready so high that the relative contributions of an
unintended pregnancy or of delaying prenatal care
were comparatively small. This analysis seems to sup-
port a similar conclusion.
Notably, in the studies by Gazmararian and
Dietz and in the present analysis the strongest associ-
ations between unintended pregnancy and physical
abuse were found among the groups that comprise
the majority of women who gave birth. For example,
in the PRAMS sample, women aged 20 years or older
comprised 87% of those who had a live birth, and
women with 12 or more years of education repre-
sented 80%. On the basis of ﬁndings from our analy-
sis, women with these characteristics had almost 2.5
times the likelihood of experiencing abuse if their
pregnancy was unintended. Moreover, among large
groups of childbearing women, such as mothers aged
20–29 years (52% of the women who gave birth in
the PRAMS states), the risk of abuse is more than
twofold for women with an unintended pregnancy,
and the prevalence of abuse is also relatively high
(14%). The generally high rate of unintended preg-
nancy among women having live births shows how
important the factor of abuse is overall.
Data on timing of physical abuse showed no
statistically signiﬁcant association with unintended
pregnancy, and therefore shed little light on the issue
of how unintended pregnancy may be temporally re-
lated to abuse. It is important, however, that almost
half of the abused women reported physical abuse
both before and during the pregnancy. For some
women, abuse and unintended pregnancy may be
parts of an ongoing climate or cycle of risk factors
and may both be factors associated with relationship
or family dysfunction.
This analysis was conducted using a unique, pop-
ulation-based data source, which allows us to make
inferences about the entire population of women giv-
ing birth in the states included in the analysis. The
large number of women sampled allowed us to con-
sider issues such as timing of the abuse, and how
abuse differed according to whether the pregnancy
was mistimed or unwanted. The availability of a vari-
ety of covariates allowed us to conduct stratiﬁed anal-
ysis to identify effect modiﬁers.
Some factors also limit the ﬁndings of this analy-
sis. PRAMS data are self-reported and therefore may
not accurately reﬂect the true magnitude of the prob-
lem of abuse. Willingness to report abuse on a mail
or telephone survey may vary according to women’s
subjective deﬁnitions of what acts constitute abuse,
fears about conﬁdentiality, or stigma associated with
reporting abuse. However, we expect that these fac-
tors would most likely contribute to underreporting
of abuse rather than to exaggeration of the true prev-
alence of the problem. Since the PRAMS question-
naire asked women only about physical abuse, other
forms of abuse (e.g., sexual or verbal) were excluded.
Additionally, our deﬁnition of ‘‘violence around the
time of pregnancy’’ includes the 12 months prior to
conception; the relative length of this time period
may mean that some women were included for whom
physical abuse and conception occurred up to 12
months apart. PRAMS data can be generalized only
to populations of new mothers in the states where
data were collected. Women whose pregnancies did
not result in live births, comprising an estimated 54%
of unintended pregnancies in the United States in
1994 (5), were not included. Since several studies
have indicated a possible association between elec-
tive abortion and abuse (14, 15) and since the major-
ity of pregnancies terminating in elective abortion
were unintended, this omission may seriously limit
our ability to examine the true magnitude of the
association between abuse and unintended preg-
nancy. Finally, PRAMS data do not provide sufﬁcient
information on circumstances and timing of physical
abuse (including frequency) to examine the issue of
causality. We were unable, using these data, to deter-
mine the extent to which abuse before pregnancy
was directly or indirectly linked to the occurrence of
an unintended pregnancy. Conversely, we did not
have sufﬁcient data to determine whether abuse
might have occurred as a direct or indirect result of
having an unintended pregnancy. These questions
are important and merit further research.
In the United States in 1995, an estimated 1.2
million births to women of all ages resulted from
unintended pregnancies (4). In the 14 states repre-
sented in this study, women whose pregnancies were
unintended had more than double the risk of experi-
encing abuse around the time of pregnancy compared
with women whose pregnancies were intended. Nev-
ertheless, prevalence of abuse was high among some
groups of women regardless of intendedness (up to

92
Goodwin, Gazmararian, Johnson, Gilbert, Saltzman, and the PRAMS Working Group
24% among women for whom the baby’s father stated
that he did not want the pregnancy). Moreover, phys-
ical abuse occurred among 5% of women whose preg-
nancies were intended.
Physical abuse and unintended pregnancy are
both public health issues that can affect the health
and well-being of women and their children. Al-
though it is unclear whether a causal association ex-
ists, reductions in high rates of unintended pregnancy
could contribute to a reduction in violence against
women, or vice versa. Unintended pregnancy is not
the only risk factor for a woman’s experience of phys-
ical abuse, but it may be an issue that clinicians can
use to open a discussion of physical, sexual, or emo-
tional abuse. Before routine screening and interven-
tions addressing violence against women are widely
adopted and implemented in reproductive health
care settings, however, further research is necessary
to establish best practices in screening for violence
and intervention or referral of abused women to ap-
propriate social services. Although much attention
has been focused on the clinician’s role, determining
effective measures to address violence against women
within reproductive health care settings will also re-
quire a better understanding of what happens to
women after the clinical encounter.
