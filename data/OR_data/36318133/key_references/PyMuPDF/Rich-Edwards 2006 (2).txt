Objective: Data are scarce regarding the sociodemographic predictors of antenatal and postpartum
depression. This study investigated whether race/ethnicity, age, finances, and partnership status were
associated with antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms.
Setting: 1662 participants in Project Viva, a US cohort study.
Design: Mothers indicated mid-pregnancy and six month postpartum depressive symptoms on the
Edinburgh postpartum depression scale (EPDS). Associations of sociodemographic factors with odds of
scoring .12 on the EPDS were estimated.
Main results: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 9% at mid-pregnancy and 8% postpartum.
Black and Hispanic mothers had a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms compared with non-
Hispanic white mothers. These associations were explained by lower income, financial hardship, and
higher incidence of poor pregnancy outcome among minority women. Young maternal age was
associated with greater risk of antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms, largely attributable to the
prevalence of financial hardship, unwanted pregnancy, and lack of a partner. The strongest risk factor for
antenatal depressive symptoms was a history of depression (OR = 4.07; 95% CI 3.76, 4.40), and the
strongest risk for postpartum depressive symptoms was depressive symptoms during pregnancy (6.78;
4.07, 11.31) or a history of depression before pregnancy (3.82; 2.31, 6.31).
Conclusions: Financial hardship and unwanted pregnancy are associated with antenatal and postpartum
depressive symptoms. Women with a history of depression and those with poor pregnancy outcomes are
especially vulnerable to depressive symptoms during the childbearing year. Once these factors are taken
in account, minority mothers have the same risk of antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms as
white mothers.
M
ajor depressive disorder affects more than 20% of
women during their lifetime, and is a leading cause of
morbidity among women.5 Pregnancy and the post-
partum months may be windows of heightened vulnerability
to depression. Antenatal and postpartum depression are
associated with marital discord and low social, emotional,
and cognitive competence among offspring.2–5
Despite advances in understanding the causes of major
depression, the predictors of antenatal and postpartum
depressive
symptoms
remain
poorly
understood.
Major
depression in women is associated with poor social support,
marital conflict, adverse life events, and low maternal
education.6 Poverty is a powerful predictor of major depres-
sion, with incidence rates two to three times higher among
lowest socioeconomic groups.7 8 Several stressors associated
with major depression also predict depression during the
childbearing year. Primary among these are adverse life
events and poor social support.9–12
There is more debate, and less data, with regard to
sociodemographic risk factors for antenatal and postpartum
depression. Although several studies report no association of
socioeconomic
position
with
antenatal
and
postpartum
depression,13–18 others conducted in impoverished areas report
depression rates as high as 25% during pregnancy and 20% or
more postpartum.11 19 20 Large epidemiological surveys have
shown that white persons and Hispanics may be more
vulnerable to major depression uncomplicated by other
illness, while black persons are especially prone to comorbid
depression.21–23 Almost no studies, however, have examined
how antenatal and postpartum depression vary across racial
and ethnic groups, and the extent to which such variation is
explained by socioeconomic position. We determined to
investigate sociodemographic predictors of antenatal and
postpartum
depressive
symptoms
in
a
large
obstetrics
practice.
METHODS
Project Viva is a prospective cohort study of pregnancy
outcomes and maternal and child health.24 25 Participants
were recruited at their first prenatal visit to one of eight
obstetric practices associated with Harvard Vanguard Medical
Associates, a large group practice in urban and suburban
Boston. This analysis used data collected at enrolment (at a
mean
10
weeks’
gestation),
mid-pregnancy
(28 weeks’
gestation), and at six months postpartum.
Of 2128 Project Viva participants who delivered a live
infant, 1662 (78%) completed a mid-pregnancy questionnaire
that assessed history of depression as well as current
depressive symptoms with a 10 item Edinburgh postpartum
depressive symptoms scale (EPDS).26 At six months post-
partum, 1278 respondents (77% of the cohort that completed
the mid-pregnancy questionnaire) completed a second EPDS.
We chose the EPDS because it has been validated for both
antenatal and postpartum use.26–28 The EPDS focuses on
cognitive and affective symptoms, avoiding the inflation of
prevalence by physical symptoms (such as fatigue and
221
www.jech.com

physical discomfort) typical of normal pregnancy and the
postpartum.9 29 An EPDS score above 12 indicates probable
depression.29–31 Validation of the EPDS against diagnostic
clinical interviews indicated a specificity of 78% and a
sensitivity of 86%.26 While a score of more than 12 on the
EPDS does not confirm depression, factors that predict an
EPDS score above this threshold probably predict clinically
significant depression.
We measured history of depressive symptoms before
pregnancy with the question, ‘‘Before this pregnancy, was
there ever a period of time when you were feeling depressed
or down or when you lost interest in pleasurable activities
most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 weeks?’’ There
were 309 women (19%) who endorsed this question. A
history of depression required an endorsement of the
symptom question plus either an indication that she saw a
health care professional who said she was depressed or an
indication that a health care professional had prescribed her a
medication for depression. By this definition, 185 (11%)
women had a history of depression. Concerned that women
with lower socioeconomic status might be less likely to
receive professional diagnosis or treatment of depression, we
also considered history of depressive symptoms without
treatment or diagnosis.
We measured by interview and questionnaire risk factors
for depression.
Maternal
age, race/ethnicity,
immigrant
status, household income, education, maternal employment
status, cigarette smoking, pre-pregnant body mass index (kg/
m2), partnership status, and pregnancy intention/wantedness
were recorded at enrolment, typically in the first trimester.
Pregnancy intention/wantedness was assessed with the
question: ‘‘Regarding this pregnancy: (a) I was actively
trying to become pregnant; (b) I was not actively trying, but I
was glad to become pregnant; (c) I wanted to be pregnant
someday, but not now; or (d) I did not want to be pregnant
now or at any time in the future’’. Because of small numbers,
we collapsed both ‘‘not now’’ responses into one category
that represented 5% of respondents. As teen motherhood and
childbearing before the typical age of college graduation were
rare in this cohort, we considered as the youngest age group
mothers under the age of 23 years (74 participants, or 4% of
the cohort). We chose this age cut off point because it
represented the age at which a woman might bear a child
after having completed four years of post-high school
education. Social support was recorded at mid-pregnancy,
using short questionnaire scales that measured emotional
and material support from a partner and, separately, from
family or friends.32 Offspring birth weight was extracted from
hospital delivery records. At six months postpartum, when
the EPDS was readministered, we again recorded partnership
status, body mass index, cigarette smoking, household
income, financial hardship, maternal employment, as well
as resumption of menstrual cycles, breast feeding, social
support, postpartum physical symptoms, and quantity of
maternal and infant sleep. Postpartum financial hardship
was defined as a ‘‘no’’ response to any of the following items,
‘‘Since your baby was born, have you always had enough
money to: (a) buy infant formula; (b) buy baby food; (c) buy
nappies (diapers); (d) buy food; (e) pay rent or mortgage.’’
We
used
multiple
imputation
to
account
for
missing
independent variables.33 This study was approved by the
human subjects committee of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.
Statistical analysis
We built logistic regression models to account for the
independent and confounding effects of many variables.
We sought to include only variables that were either (1) a
main exposure
under
investigation
(age, race/ethnicity,
immigrant status, household income, financial hardship,
partnership status) or (2) theoretical or empirical confoun-
ders of the main exposures (such as parity or delivery of a low
birthweight infant). Where information is lacking on the
exact
timing
of
the
‘‘exposures’’
relative
to
onset
of
depressive symptoms, it can be murky to discover if the
‘‘exposures’’ might in fact be the result of a history of
depressive symptoms. For example, could current partnership
status be a result of previous depressive symptoms? Did
depressive symptoms start before or after the conception of
an unintended pregnancy? We therefore performed second-
ary analyses to test whether exposure-outcome relations were
similar among women without a history of depression or
depressive symptoms.

months postpartum, 8% of participants scored .12 on the
EPDS. There were 1278 participants who responded to both
the antenatal and postpartum questionnaires: among these
women, 31% of women with antenatal depressive symptoms
also suffered from postpartum depressive symptoms. In
contrast, only 6% without antenatal depressive symptoms
experienced postpartum depressive symptoms.
Risk factors for depressive symptoms
Table
1
shows
the
prevalence
of
risk
factors.
These
unadjusted statistics show higher prevalence of depressive
symptoms among mothers who were younger, less educated,
with fewer financial resources, without a spouse or cohabi-
tating partner, and those who delivered low birthweight
infants. Before adjusting for other factors associated with
minority status, it seemed that there was a higher prevalence
of depressive symptoms among black and Hispanic mothers.
The remaining analysis focused on identifying which of these
were independent risk factors for depressive symptoms.
Predictors of antenatal depressive symptoms
Table 2 shows models built to investigate predictors of
antenatal depressive symptoms. In a basic model including
maternal age, race/ethnicity, immigrant status, and parity
(model 1), we found decreasing risks of antenatal depressive
symptoms with increasing maternal age, with the youngest
mothers (,23 years) at two or more times the risk of
depressive symptoms compared with older mothers. In this
naive model, black and Hispanic mothers seemed to be at
increased risk of antenatal depressive symptoms. However,
further adjustment for household income (model 2) dam-
pened the associations of maternal age and race/ethnicity
with antenatal depressive symptoms.
We further adjusted for partnership status and pregnancy
intention in model 3. Lack of a spouse or cohabitating partner
and
unwanted
pregnancy
doubled
the
risk
of
second
trimester depressive symptoms. Accounting for these factors
in model 3 reduced the risk associated with young mother-
hood and minority status. Further adjustment for maternal

symptoms as employed women, whether they were seeking
work (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 0.64, 1.95) or not (OR = 0.90, 95%
CI 0.47, 1.72).
We considered first trimester social support from family/
friends and from partner (model 4), both of which were
associated with reduced risk of antenatal depressive symp-
toms in the second trimester, although only support from
family and friends was statistically significantly related to
antenatal depressive symptoms. Adjustment for social sup-
port dampened, but did not eliminate, the risk of antenatal
depressive symptoms associated with being unpartnered or
carrying an unwanted pregnancy. There was little evidence of
race or age associations in model 4.
A history of any depressive symptoms before pregnancy
(age adjusted OR = 4.51, 95% CI 4.24, 4.80) and of diagnosed
or treated depression (age adjusted OR = 4.07, 95% CI 3.76,
4.40) were potent risk factors for antenatal depressive
symptoms. We reasoned that a history of depression or
depressive symptoms before pregnancy might adversely
influence partnership status or pregnancy intention, each of
which was associated with antenatal depressive symptoms in
this cohort. To examine whether these factors affected risk of
antenatal depressive symptoms independent of any associa-
tion with prepregnancy depression, we reran model 3 among
the group of 1353 women who reported no history of
depression or depressive symptoms before pregnancy, among
whom 84 (6%) reported a first onset of depressive symptoms
during pregnancy. We found slightly weaker associations of
partnership status (OR = 2.08; 0.90, 4.84) and unwanted
pregnancy (1.89; 0.88, 4.09) with risk of antenatal depressive
symptoms among women with no history of depression
before pregnancy, compared with the full cohort (ORs of 2.34
and 2.31, respectively, in model 3 in table 2).
Predictors of postpartum depressive symptoms
Table 3 shows models built to identify sociodemographic
predictors of depressive symptoms at six months postpartum.
As with antenatal depression, we again found increased risk
of postpartum depressive symptoms among the youngest
mothers (model 5). While black and Hispanic mothers
seemed to be at higher risk of postpartum depressive
symptoms, these associations lacked statistical significance.
Having delivered a low birthweight infant conferred a nearly
threefold higher risk of postpartum depressive symptoms;
this explained a small portion of the increased risk associated
with young maternal age and minority status (model 6). In
model 7, we added a measure of financial hardship that more
than tripled the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms.
Household income (model 7) had an inconsistent association
with postpartum depressive symptoms (whether or not the
financial hardship term was in the model). These financial
factors explained all of the apparent higher risk among black
mothers and much of the higher risk seen among Hispanic
mothers, and a portion of the risk associated with young
motherhood. Partnership status and pregnancy intention
were not associated with postpartum depressive symptoms.
Further adjustment for cigarette smoking, breast feeding,
return of menses, infant sleeping hours, postpartum physical
symptoms (haemorrhoids, incontinence, varicose veins, pain
during sex, sciatica, sore breasts, or back pain), postpartum
body mass index, or history of depression of depressive
symptoms before or during the pregnancy did not materially
change these findings. While mothers who were not working
outside the home and mothers on maternity leave were at the
same risk of postpartum depressive symptoms as employed
mothers, those who were looking for work were more likely
to have postpartum depressive symptoms (OR = 2.35; 1.00,
5.49, compared with employed mothers).
Although partnership status did not seem to determine
postpartum depressive symptoms, social support from a
partner had a strong protective association with postpartum
depressive symptoms, as did social support from family and
friends (model 8). When these social support factors were
added to the model (model 9), the risk associated with
hardship decreased considerably, suggesting that the impact
of financial hardship on postpartum depressive symptoms
may be partly explained by low social support that may
accompany or predate hardship.
A history of undiagnosed depressive symptoms before
pregnancy (OR = 3.37; 2.14, 5.29), diagnosed or treated pre-
pregnancy depression (OR = 3.82; 2.31, 6.31) or antenatal
depressive symptoms (OR = 6.78; 4.07, 11.31) conferred a
several-fold higher risk of postpartum depressive symptoms.
When we ran model 8 among the 1051 mothers with no
history of depressive symptoms before or during pregnancy,
financial hardship remained a risk factor (OR = 4.05; 1.6,
9.83) for postpartum depressive symptoms, but low birth-
weight did not (OR = 1.45; 0.40,5.28).
DISCUSSION
We saw a 9% prevalence of antenatal depressive symptoms,
which is on the lower side of the 9% to 15% prevalence of
antenatal depressive symptoms reported by other studies
using the EPDS.31 34 Other studies, using a variety of
depression assessment tools, have reported antenatal depres-
sion prevalences of 9%–28% for predominantly middle class
samples11 19 35 and 25%–50%11 19 36 for low income popula-
tions. The somewhat lower prevalence in our population
probably reflects both the specificity of the EPDS and the
comparatively high socioeconomic position of our cohort.
Although our study is one of the first to report a higher
prevalence of antenatal depressive symptoms among minor-
ity and young mothers, these associations were largely
explained by differences in income, partnership status, and
pregnancy intention. We saw a roughly 30% higher pre-
valence of antenatal depressive symptoms among women
with household incomes below $40 000, although this did
not reach statistical significance. However, the higher risk is
consistent with several studies20 35 37 that have reported high
prevalence of antenatal depression among women of lower
socioeconomic position. We also found a twofold increased
risk of antenatal depressive symptoms with unwanted
pregnancy, which we believe has not been previously
examined. By far the most powerful risk factor for depressive
symptoms during pregnancy was a history of prior depres-
sion, which conferred a fourfold increased risk of antenatal
depressive symptoms, similar to that reported in a small
study of Norwegian mothers.1
Few studies have examined race/ethnicity as a risk factor
for postpartum depression. As with antenatal depression, the
higher prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms that
we saw among minority mothers was explained by financial
hardship. Although some studies report no associations of
postpartum
depression
with
socioeconomic
position,11 39
others have found that financial difficulties,19 29 unemploy-
ment,11 38 or low education36 are more prevalent among
women with postpartum depression. We saw a nearly
threefold increased risk of postpartum depression among

mothers who had low birthweight infants. One study
reported increased risk of postpartum depression with poor
infant health,36 but another found reduced risk of depression
among women who had delivered before term.29 The single
strongest risk factor for postpartum depressive symptoms
was depressive symptoms during pregnancy, as has been seen
consistently.34 40
To the extent that depressive symptoms before, during, and
after pregnancy represent a consistent underlying depressive
syndrome, it is possible that depressive symptoms preceding
pregnancy might increase social and economic risk (such as
unemployment or lack of a partner); if this were the case,
these social and economic risks might seem as spurious
‘‘predictors’’ of antenatal and postpartum depression. To our
knowledge, no study has examined whether these risk factors
predict depressive symptoms among women with no history
of depressive symptoms. Lack of a partner and unwanted
pregnancy remained associated with antenatal depressive
symptoms among women with no history of depressive
symptoms, suggesting that the risks associated with partner-
ship status and pregnancy intention are not spurious
artefacts of an antecedent depressive symptoms. For post-
partum depressive symptoms, financial hardship was a risk
factor
whether
or
not
women
had
experienced
prior
depressive
symptoms,
suggesting
that
poverty
precedes
postpartum depression, rather than the alternative that
depression leads to poverty.
This study had several limitations. Chief among these is
our reliance on a self reported screen of depressive symptoms,
rather than clinician diagnosis. Although the EPDS has been
validated in a broad range of populations,41 it remains
possible that cultural and/or economic factors may have
caused women to over-report or under-report depressive
symptoms. Social desirability bias may particularly affect
minority42 and lower socioeconomic participants,43 leading
them to under-report symptoms of depression,42 and us to
underestimate
associations
between
these
factors
and
depressive symptoms. The timing of exposures and the onset
of depressive symptoms is not established for every exposure;
in particular, the examination of social support and depres-
sion is effectively cross sectional and should be interpreted
with caution (as in most other studies). While 23% of the
cohort who responded to the mid-pregnancy questionnaire
did not return the postpartum questionnaire, the proportion
responding was similar among those with (75%) and without
(77%) depression mid-pregnancy. This suggests that non-
response neither substantially reduced our estimate of the
prevalence of depression, nor created bias in ascertaining
predictors of depression. If anything, the higher loss to follow
up among minority and disadvantaged mothers might have
caused us to slightly underestimate associations between
lower socioeconomic status and depressive symptoms.
In summary, we found that maternal race/ethnicity is not
an
independent
predictor
of
antenatal
or
postpartum
depressive symptoms. Instead, the apparently higher risk
among minority women seems to result from financial
hardship and, for postpartum depressive symptoms, poor
pregnancy outcome. The higher risk of antenatal and
postpartum depressive symptoms associated with young
maternal age is largely explained by financial hardship,
unwanted pregnancy, and lack of a partner. The fact that
financial hardship and partnership status predicted depres-
sive symptoms among women with no history of depressive
symptoms suggests that these factors are likely to predate,
and perhaps cause, depression during pregnancy and the
postpartum.

What this paper adds
Our report confirms that women living in disadvantage are at
higher risk of depressive symptoms during the childbearing
year. Maternal minority status does not confer risk indepen-
dent of its socioeconomic correlates, a question that had
never been satisfactorily addressed.
Policy implications
Because of their increased risk of antenatal and postpartum
depression, women facing socioeconomic hardship and
those with poor pregnancy outcomes should be targeted
for depression screening, prevention, and treatment.
