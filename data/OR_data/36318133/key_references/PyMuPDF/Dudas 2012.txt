a b s t r a c t
We aimed to determine the psychosocial and obstetric correlates of depressive symptomatology during
pregnancy in South-Eastern Hungary. A total of 1719 women were screened for depression in four
counties in 2006 and 2007, based on a Leverton Questionnaire (LQ) score of Z12 at 14–24 weeks of
gestation. The LQ scores indicated a probable depressive illness (PDI) in 17.2% of the study group. The
best predictors in a multiple regression analysis were history of major depression (adjusted odds ratio
[AOR]¼3.23), and major life events (AOR¼2.43). A perceived lack of social support from partner
(AOR¼1.79) and lack of support by family (AOR¼1.23) were also signiﬁcant determinants. Lack of
planning of pregnancy (AOR¼1.12) and a history of unfavourable obstetric outcome (AOR¼1.42) also
seem to predispose to PDI. Overall, psychosocial factors appeared important in the prediction of PDI,
whereas economic features did not.

1. Introduction
Pregnancy involves major changes in the mother’s life in many
respects, (e.g. hormonal status, social role, etc.), and the exact
correlation between these and depression is of increasing scien-
tiﬁc interest (Ross et al., 2004; Halbreich, 2010). There is a
growing body of literature about depressive symptoms during
pregnancy with most studies using questionnaire measures to
detect probable cases with high levels of symptomatology. In a
wide-ranging literature review, Lancaster et al. (2010) found that
the strongest predictors of depressive symptomatology during
pregnancy were maternal anxiety during pregnancy, life stress,
past history of depression, lack of social support, experiencing
stressful life events in the previous year, lower education, smok-
ing, single marital status, and poor relationship quality. Mothers
satisﬁed with their family life appear more protected from depression
during pregnancy (Goyal et al., 2010; Lancaster et al., 2010; Evans
et al., 2001). Those with employment problems and on chronically
low income are at a greater risk of developing depressive symptoms
during pregnancy (Goyal et al., 2010; Lancaster et al., 2010).
Unplanned or unwanted pregnancy can likewise be a risk factor
(Lancaster et al., 2010), and these are major determinants for
depression in the postpartum period as well (Beck, 2001; Leverton
and Elliott, 2000a,b; Robertson et al., 2004; Kozinszky et al., 2011). In
the Eastern half of Central Europe, mothers have to cope with a
different pattern of psychosocial risk factors compared to those
described in the existing literature, e.g. increasing poverty rate and
a transition in attitudes to returning to work in the postpartum
period (Kozinszky et al., 2011).
Roughly 5–15% of women (Chatillon and Even, 2010) are found
to suffer with high levels of depressive symptoms during preg-
nancy at any moment in time, whereas as many as 12.7% of
pregnant women experience major depressive disorder at some
point during pregnancy (Gaynes et al., 2005; Vesga-Lo´pez et al.,
2008). However the reported prevalence values vary depending
on the method used for diagnosis and on whether the data
collection was done in a prospective or retrospective manner
(Austin, 2003). In community studies, usually, only prevalence
estimates based on screening test scores are feasible (Robertson
et al., 2004).
Although it is of paramount importance to identify and treat
depression during and after pregnancy, especially among women

at heightened risk, in Central Europe there is a dearth of research
on the epidemiology of depression during pregnancy. Identiﬁca-
tion of the sociocultural factors most relevant to the sufferer’s
own experience makes it possible for any intervention to be more
closely targeted to the individual case (Nahas et al., 1999). To our
knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst study to estimate prevalence rates and
to look into the sociodemographic, economic and psychological
predictors of probable depression during pregnancy in Central
Europe.
1.1. Aims
The main goals of this study were to perform a large-scale
survey to (1) estimate the prevalence of depression during
pregnancy in South-Eastern Hungary and (2) to examine the
inﬂuence of sociodemographic, economic, and psychological risk
factors on this.
We predicted that several of the sociodemographic variables
(e.g. marital status, number of children, etc. (Hungarian Statistical
Ofﬁce, 2007) had an inﬂuence on the prevalence of probable
depression in the antepartum period, as they did in the post-
partum (Kozinszky et al., 2011). It was suggested that the
unfavourable economic situation of the average Hungarian family
would have a strong inﬂuence on depressive symptoms during
pregnancy (Kozinszky et al., 2011). The poverty rate in the entire
Hungarian population was 14.3% in 2006 (Hungarian Statistical
Ofﬁce, 2008), and in those households where the mother returned
to work soon after delivery the poverty rate was less than half of
that

income had appeared to be linked to higher risk of probable

in

Hungary
(Kozinszky et al., 2011), but its association with depression during
pregnancy was unknown.

Methods
2.1.
Participants and procedure
The study was carried out in all the 62 pregnancy-care centres of South-
Eastern Hungary between 20th November, 2006 and 31st September, 2007. All
women between weeks 12 and 24 of their pregnancy living in the four counties of
South-Eastern Hungary were invited into the study.
After an explanation of the objectives of the study and informed consent, a
trained health visitor conducted a questionnaire interview, guaranteeing anon-
ymity. Initially, 2117 pregnant mothers were invited to participate in the study,
out of whom 286 (13.2%) declined to participate. One hundred and twelve (5.2%)
mothers were excluded mainly due to second trimester abortion, and, a smaller
proportion of them, due to mourning for a deceased husband or parent, depression
due to a general medical condition not related to the pregnancy (e.g. progressive
malignant illness) or other acute psychiatric illness diagnosed by a trained
psychiatrist, neurological problems, such as epilepsy, or illiteracy, which was very
rare. A remaining 1719 pregnant women in the second trimester (between 14 and
24 weeks of gestation) participated in the study.
Leverton and her colleagues created their 24-item questionnaire (LQ) tapping
into symptoms of major and minor depression to detect PPD (Elliott et al., 2000).
We had previously conﬁrmed that it was a valid scale measurement for screening
for depression at a cut-off value of 11/12 (Csatordai et al., 2009).
The interview in this study included the LQ, and additional structured
questions (see Appendix) exploring sociodemographic, obstetric, economic, and
psychological risk factors. Some questions derived from worldwide ﬁndings
regarding major risk factors for perinatal depressive symptoms, whereas others
were created in an attempt to study the effects of sociodemographic and
psychosocial determinants speciﬁc to Hungary.
All of these questions were ‘yes/no’ questions and corresponded to a variable
in our analysis, except for the variable of major life events in the past year for
which a minimum of two items from a list of ten questions selected from
established life events scales (Paykel et al., 1971) was required to be answered
positively for the variable to be coded as positive (Robertson et al., 2004): (1) being
separated or divorced, (2) serious problems in marriage or cohabiting relationship,
(3) serious problems or conﬂicts with family, friends, or neighbours, (4) problems
at work or in place of education, (5) economic problems, (6) serious illness or
injury, (7) serious illness or injury in close family, (8) road trafﬁc accident, ﬁre, or
theft, (9) loss of a close relative, and (10) other difﬁculties (Newman and Bland,
1994). As described by several authors, the occurrence of two or more stressful
major life events in the previous year is a strong predictor of perinatal depression
(Newman and Bland, 1994; Elliott et al., 2000; Robertson et al., 2004; Kozinszky
et al., 2011). A history of major depression independent of childbirth or prior
postpartum depression has a strong inﬂuence on perinatal depression (Elliott
et al., 2000; Robertson et al., 2004; Lancaster et al., 2010; Kozinszky et al., 2011),
and this too was examined. Health visitors explored any previous history of
depression from the patient’s account, clinic letters, discharge summaries, and
prescription records. Where previous records were not available and the patient
reported a history of low mood suggestive of a depressive illness, a psychiatrist
also interviewed the patient to establish whether the diagnosis of a past episode
was warranted. Self-deﬁned low income and the intention to return to work after
the postpartum period (6–12 months after delivery) also appeared of interest
based on the previous literature (Leverton and Elliott, 2000a,b; Lancaster et al.,
2010; Kozinszky et al., 2011). Emerging evidence suggests that subjective evalua-
tion of one’s own economic status is a better predictor of future psychiatric
morbidity than unemployment or objectively deﬁned poverty (Weich and Lewis,
1998). Intention to return to work was an important variable, as, although the
relevant laws and state provision had not changed, there seemed to be a changing
trend in mothers to return to work as early as possible and this had not been
examined in previous studies. We further wished to examine associations with
different aspects of satisfaction with family life, perceived support by partner and
family, relationship quality, and an independent style of management of problems
of everyday life (Elliott et al., 2000; Tammentie et al., 2002). We were also
interested to study the effect of previous stillbirth, congenital malformations, and
spontaneous and induced abortion.
The study protocol and the questionnaire were approved by the Clinical
Research Ethics Committee of the University of Szeged (date of approval: 29
November 2005; reference number: 13-3/63/2005). The study was carried out in
full accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
2.2.
Statistical analysis
Computations were carried out with the SPSS 14.0 software (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL). Most continuous variables did not show normal distribution in our
participant groups; therefore, non-parametric tests were used.
The correlations between binary categorical variables were analysed by chi-
square tests. To test between group differences, the Kruskal–Wallis analysis of
variance was used. Also, multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to assess
demographic and psychosocial characteristics of probable depression during
pregnancy in a simultaneous fashion. All bivariate analyses were weighted to
age and type of residence representative for South-Eastern Hungary (McCulloch
and Searle, 2001). Each variable included into the ﬁnal model was highly
signiﬁcant and the most robust model was chosen (Hosmer and Lemeshow,
1989). Multicollinearity of the variables and linearity of log odds in the ﬁnal model
were also tested.
3. Results
3.1. Participant attributes
The social and demographic circumstances of the participants
are presented in Table 1. Out of our 1719 participants, 295 (17.2%)
mothers had an LQ score of Z12 (probable depressive illness;
PDI). The PDI group was not different in terms of age from the
mothers scoring below 12 on the LQ (non-PDI). A higher propor-
tion of those with PDI lived on farms (8.5%) than of those without
depression (3.8%) (p¼0.002). Healthy mothers were more likely
to be married or to live in a cohabitant partnership (with no
signiﬁcant difference). A slightly lower educational attainment
was observed in the PDI relative to the non-PDI group, and there
was practically no difference in the number of children.
A notable difference could be observed in the rates of primi-
parity between the PDI and non-PDI group, with signiﬁcantly
more primiparous women in the non-PDI group. Previous induced
abortion or unfavourable obstetric outcome increased the like-
lihood of PDI. Mothers with PDI were generally less likely to have
sterility or infertility before the actual pregnancy. Importantly,
pregnancy planning was a factor highly distinctive between the
R.B. Dudas et al. / Psychiatry Research 200 (2012) 323–328
324

PDI and non-PDI mothers (rate of unplanned pregnancy: 31.2% vs.
22.1%, respectively). As expected, the occurrence of unwanted
pregnancy was relatively small, as were the differences observed
between the PDI and non-PDI group in this regard.
Psychosocial factors potentially associated with PDI are listed
in Table 2. There was a signiﬁcant association between a past
history of a major depressive episode and PDI (OR: 4.6). The
likelihood of developing PDI was nearly 3 times higher in those
with major life events during the year prior to testing. Interest-
ingly, a poor relationship between the mother and her partner
was not a risk factor for developing PDI (OR: 0.81). As expected,
the lack of perceived support by the partner appeared to increase
the likelihood of PDI (OR: 1.36), as did the lack of family support
(OR: 1.39).
The likelihood of PDI was almost double in those reporting a
low income (OR: 1.9). Relative to non-depressed mothers, sig-
niﬁcantly fewer depressed mothers intended to return to work
after postpartum period (OR: 0.44), whereas independent style of
management of everyday life problems was not distinguishing
between the two groups.
3.2. Simultaneous risk factors of PDI as determined by multiple
logistic regression analysis
Table 3 presents the logistic regression model, including
parameters and corresponding adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for
PDI as compared with the non-PDI mothers. There was no multi-
collinearity between the signiﬁcant variables and the liner corre-
lation of the logit odds was signiﬁcant.
There was no signiﬁcant association between PDI and the type
of residence of the mother, despite the difference experienced in
the single comparison. Primiparity had a small but signiﬁcant
risk-reducing effect on PDI. Like in the univariate analyses, the
lack of perceived support from the partner or the family had
strong effects on PDI, with odds ratios suggesting an increased
risk. It is of note that women who had treatment due to infertility

before they became pregnant had lower odds of PDI, with history
of infertility appearing to act as a protective factor. Spontaneous
or induced abortion or stillbirth in the obstetric history appeared
to be relatively strong predictors in a multiple regression analysis.
A history of depression and major life events experienced in the
past year posed a risk for PDI, and their effect was remarkably
stronger than that of the previous variables. Unplanned preg-
nancy seemed to increase the odds of PDI to a relatively small
extent.
4. Discussion
4.1. Psychosocial and obstetric risk factors in PDI during pregnancy
Our ﬁndings suggest that the prevalence of PDI among preg-
nant women in Hungary, 17.2%, is not speciﬁcally higher than that
in most Western populations (de Tychey et al., 2005; Lancaster
et al., 2010; Gaynes et al., 2005). There is a relative dearth of data
from the rest of the world, and to our knowledge ours is the ﬁrst
report on PDI during pregnancy from Central Europe. As regards
sociodemographic characteristics, the overall number of preg-
nancy terminations has declined in parallel with the number of
live births during the past decade (Hungarian Statistical Ofﬁce,
2007; Bunevicius et al., 2009). Similarly to Western European
countries, there has been a shift in Hungary towards delaying
childbirth, due to the more career-oriented lifestyle of women,
besides other social and economic reasons (Hungarian Statistical
Ofﬁce, 2007; Kozinszky et al., 2002). In the middle of the 1990s in
Hungary, around 80% of unintended pregnancies were prevented
either by modern contraception or terminated by abortion. By
2002, merely 2% of live births could be classiﬁed as unwanted
pregnancy (Hungarian Statistical Ofﬁce, 2007). In our study, the
corresponding ﬁgure was 4.2%. It is of note that, similar to our
ﬁndings with PPD (Kozinszky et al., 2011), we detected a remarkably
higher rate of unplanned pregnancy amongst pregnant women with
PDI (31.2%) as compared to controls (22.1%), which is in line with
the 17% reported for 2002 in Hungary (Hungarian Statistical Ofﬁce,
2007). A greater prevalence of depressive disorder during pregnancy
is independently associated with unplanned and unwanted preg-
nancy (Lancaster et al., 2010; Bunevicius et al., 2009).
Although the overall purchasing power parity values for
Hungary have increased over the 10-year period prior to our
study, in 2006 more families fell into the lower economic bracket
than 10 years earlier and more mothers were compelled to return
to work after giving birth due to the unfavourable socioeconomic
circumstances (Hungarian Statistical Ofﬁce, 2008) with its poten-
tial health consequences. Interestingly, economic factors (self-
reported low income and intention to return to work after the
postpartum period) seemed to be less convincingly inﬂuential on
PDI during pregnancy than on PPD (Kozinszky et al., 2011); as
regards PDI during pregnancy, they only appeared to be signiﬁ-
cant risk factors in univariate (but not in multivariate) analyses.
In accordance with previous studies, we observed that the
presence of a previous minor/major depressive disorder was
signiﬁcantly associated with antepartum depression (Kozinszky
et al., 2002; Bunevicius et al., 2009; Goyal et al., 2010; Lancaster
et al., 2010); whereas the independent management of everyday
problems was not a signiﬁcant predictor.
Families now tend to raise fewer children (Hungarian Statistical
Ofﬁce, 2007), at a later age, after a more risky pregnancy than earlier
(Kozinszky et al., 2002; Bunevicius et al., 2009), which can give rise to
PDI during pregnancy more easily (Lancaster et al., 2010). It is of
relevance that an average of 1.6 children are born per families in
Hungary and the mother is at least 27 years of age at the ﬁrst
childbearing (Hungarian Statistical Ofﬁce, 2007). The mothers in our
sample were of a similar age (27.7574.51 years), with a similar
number of children (1.5870.92), with no signiﬁcant difference
between the study groups. Apart from the increasing jeopardy of
the instability of relationships, the decrease in fertility with increasing
age could also be a genuine risk factor (Kozinszky et al., 2002). Every
third Hungarian child was born out of wedlock in 2006, Hungarian
women nowadays being less likely to be married. The mothers in our
survey reﬂected this tendency (the rate of being married at the time
of delivery was 66% in 2006). Nowadays, more than half (52.3%) of
marriages end with divorce (Hungarian Statistical Ofﬁce, 2007).
Interestingly, in our study a married status did not play an
important role in triggering or protecting from PDI during
pregnancy, whereas others concluded that living alone is asso-
ciated with a higher chance of developing a depressive illness
(Bunevicius et al., 2009; Lancaster et al., 2010; Melville et al.,
2010). A possible explanation for this paradox is the trend of
raising a child in a cohabitant relationship, which does not
necessarily mean that the relationship is unstable. An unstable
relationship with the partner has been described to have a
detrimental effect in terms of depression risk (Pajulo et al.,
2001; Bunevicius et al., 2009; Lancaster et al., 2010), however,
in our study, we found no signiﬁcant effect in either univariate or
multivariate analyses, which is a surprising result. In our multiple
regression model, unstable relationship was displaced by lack of
support from partner.
It is evident that a lack of support from her partner and family
may force a mother to try and overcome her everyday problems
alone, which makes it necessary for the mother to overcome her
distress (Pajulo et al., 2001; Lancaster et al., 2010; Melville et al.,
2010). Similar to what we saw in PPD (Kozinszky et al., 2011),
with an increasing trend in Europe for couples not to get married,
we predict that the stability and quality of the relationship will
likely take over the protective quality against depression of being
married, as not being married is becoming more common and
probably less of a sign of relationship problems and a risk factor
for perinatal depression.
Our study has provided further evidence that perceived sup-
port from the family environment can help the mother (Pajulo
et al., 2001; Lancaster et al., 2010; Melville et al., 2010). However,
it is difﬁcult to assess causal relations, and to establish whether
depression during pregnancy is caused by a lack of support or it
distorts a depressed mother’s perception of her environment’s
attitude.
When the features were examined simultaneously, family-
related risk factors (lack of partner and family support) still
appeared important. However, a history of depression and life
stressors in past year, as other ‘traditional’ risk factors, still
seemed to be the strongest predictors. Although stressful life
events and depression are consistently found to be strongly
associated, establishing the degree to which stress has a causal

et al., 2011), the probability of PDI was lower among mothers who
expected their ﬁrst newborn. This is inconsistent with the result
of a previous review (Lancaster et al., 2010). A signiﬁcant
proportion of primiparas have a history of infertility and IVF,
and becoming pregnant is a very positive experience for these
women, according to our data, reducing the prevalence of ante-
partum mood disorder, whereas obstetric complications, which
are more common in these women (Kozinszky et al., 2002), are
likely responsible for the increase in the risk of postpartum
depression (Adouard et al., 2005).
4.2. Methodological issues
Our study has some strengths that deserve mentioning. As far as
we are aware, this is the ﬁrst study to use a logistic regression
analysis model to evaluate the determinants of PDI during preg-
nancy. Robust, simultaneous estimates of multiple risk factors were
possible due to the fairly extensive data set collected from each
participant. Conducting a personal interview enabled us to reduce
the likelihood of misdiagnosed perinatal depression and the over-
estimation of the observed risk factors relative to the results of self-
reported questionnaire surveys (Austin, 2003; Cox and Holden,
2003). It was a limitation of our study that we did not conduct
diagnostic clinical interviews with psychiatrists to establish a
clinical diagnosis of depression; however, our previous study
(Csatordai et al., 2009) had proved that the LQ had excellent
sensitivity and speciﬁcity for PND when compared against a full
psychiatric assessment. In fact, we are only aware of a few studies
that used a clinical interview for the diagnosis of antepartum
depression, whereas the decisive majority relied on estimates based
on scoring above a cut-off score on established screening tools.
Another advantage of our report is that it is based on a large
community sample in Central Europe. Eberhard-Gran et al. (2001)
pointed out that many published predicted value estimates are
exaggerated, because they are measured in higher-prevalence
populations. It is important to note that only a small proportion
of the eligible women declined to participate in the study (13.2%).
It was a strength of our study that we surveyed a chosen set of
questions exploring the effect on the mothers their intention to
return to work, their ﬁnancial difﬁculties, or their perceived
support from their social environment.
This study has been the ﬁrst and only wide-ranging survey in
Hungary so far, drawing attention to the relatively high rate of
depression in pregnant mothers in Hungary. Our ﬁndings, con-
sistent with reports from the most developed countries with
regard to some but not all risk factors (e.g. primiparity, history of
unfavourable obstetric outcome), raise the question of the need
for a different approach for the detection of depression during
pregnancy in this part of Europe. Overall, in Hungary socio-
economic factors seem to play a less signiﬁcant role in PDI during
pregnancy than do psychosocial and pregnancy-related ones.
Universal screening during pregnancy appears desirable and the
