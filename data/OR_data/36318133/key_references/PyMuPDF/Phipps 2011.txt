Abstract
Unintended pregnancy and associated behav-
iors may play a substantial role in the increased risk of
adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with
teen pregnancy. We evaluate a multi-dimensional measure
of pregnancy intention among pregnant adolescents and
quantify the association between intention dimensions and
adverse outcomes and risk behaviors. Pregnancy intention
measures were examined in a cohort of 300 pregnant
adolescent women. We considered 18 items assessing
elements of pregnancy intention including pregnancy
planning, timing, emotional response, and readiness. Latent
class analysis was performed to identify dimensions of
pregnancy intention. Parsimonious scores were created by
minimizing the number of covariates while maintaining
substantial agreement with the latent class. Associations
between intention measures and prenatal care, risk behav-
iors, and pregnancy outcomes were quantiﬁed using mul-
tivariable logistic regression. Two constructs of pregnancy
intention were identiﬁed: planning and emotional readi-
ness. Compared with emotionally ready adolescents, ado-
lescents categorized as not emotionally ready had an
increased odds of inadequate prenatal care (OR = 2.70,
95% CI:1.27–5.72), delayed prenatal care (OR = 2.54,
95% CI:1.27–5.09), and self-reported depression at the
time
of
the
ﬁrst
prenatal
visit
(OR = 2.21,
95%
CI:1.03–4.77). Pregnancy planning was not associated with
adverse pregnancy risk factors or outcomes. Among preg-
nant adolescents, emotional readiness for pregnancy and
parenting was inversely associated with known risk factors
for adverse pregnancy outcomes, suggesting that emotional
readiness rather than pregnancy planning may be the more
pertinent intention construct for adolescents.

Introduction
Despite a decline in the rates of teen pregnancy from 1991
to 2005, teen birth rates rose in two consecutive years,
2006 and 2007 [1], and the United States continues to rank
highest among industrialized countries for births to teen
mothers [2–4]. Risks associated with adolescent pregnancy
include poor maternal weight gain, preterm birth, preg-
nancy induced hypertension, low birth weight, and neo-
natal death [2, 5–8]. Within the population of childbearing
adolescents, risks vary by age, with the youngest mothers
having the highest risks of preterm delivery and infant
mortality [5, 9–12]. Unintended pregnancy, a signiﬁcant
risk factor for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes [6],
may play a substantial role in the increased risks associated
with teen pregnancy. Although most teen pregnancies are
considered unplanned or unintended [2, 4, 13], the concept
of ‘‘unintended pregnancy’’ has been variably deﬁned and
quantiﬁed [14]. Pregnancy intention is recognized as a
multi-dimensional construct including elements of ‘‘tim-
ing,’’ ‘‘planning,’’ ‘‘happiness,’’ and ‘‘wantedness’’ [14,

15]; however, prior studies have not assessed risks asso-
ciated
with
speciﬁc
dimensions
of
intention
among
adolescents.
In this study, we evaluate multiple constructs of preg-
nancy intention in a group of pregnant adolescents
attending their ﬁrst prenatal care visit. To strengthen and
validate our understanding of these measures, we examine
the association between measures of pregnancy intention
and demographic, health behavior, and pregnancy history
characteristics. Clinical relevance is assessed through
quantifying
associations
between
pregnancy
intention
measures and adverse pregnancy outcomes and risk factors.
Methods
We assessed pregnancy intention measures in a cohort of
300 pregnant adolescent women [16]. This study was
approved by the Women and Infants Hospital Institutional
Review Board in December 2001. Informed consent was
obtained from the participant and if the participant was
younger than 18 years old, consent was obtained from her
guardian with assent of the minor (participant). Participant
recruitment occurred during their ﬁrst prenatal care visit to
the Women and Infants Hospital Women’s Primary Care
Center, Providence, RI between March 2002 and February
2005. To be eligible for inclusion, women had to be less
than 24 weeks gestation at recruitment, have an estimated
date of delivery before their 20th birthday, be able to
provide informed consent, and be able to speak and read
English or Spanish. Trained research assistants interviewed
all participants in a private setting. The 30-min structured
interview
included
questions
about
the
participant’s
demographic characteristics, life plans, social supports,
peer and family relationships, ﬁnancial support, behavioral
risks, and medical history. In cases where a participant’s
answers raised a concern about safety or depression, the
participant was referred to social services for evaluation
and management. This notiﬁcation practice was clearly
explained to the participant as part of the informed consent
process.
We considered 18 items assessing elements of preg-
nancy intention including planning, timing, wantedness,
emotional response, and readiness. The survey included
validated questions where available and where not avail-
able content-relevant questions were assessed for face
validity. The surveys underwent a process of review and
revision that included both clinical experts and age-rele-
vant volunteers. Pregnancy planning was assessed by ask-
ing participants to indicate their level of agreement with
the following statements: ‘‘I wanted to get pregnant’’, ‘‘I
have been trying to get pregnant for a while’’, and ‘‘I have
been hoping to get pregnant’’. Desired timing of pregnancy
was assessed by asking ‘‘When did you want to be preg-
nant?’’ (coded as now, later, never), ‘‘How do you feel
about being pregnant now?’’ (coded as wanted pregnancy
now or sooner, do not know, wanted pregnancy later or
never) and ‘‘What did you think the best age would be for
you to have your ﬁrst child?’’(coded as current age or
younger, 1–2 years older, or greater than 2 years older).
Pregnancy wantedness was assessed by asking respondents
to report their level of agreement with the following
statements: ‘‘For me, in my life, this is a good time to be
pregnant’’ and ‘‘I want this pregnancy at this time’’.
Emotional response was assessed by asking participants
‘‘How did you feel emotionally?’’ (angry, happy, scared,
confused, excited, worried, or sad), ‘‘How do you feel
about having a baby at this time?’’ (very glad, somewhat
glad, do not know, a little unhappy, or very unhappy), and
‘‘How do you feel about having a baby?’’ (scale from 1 to
10; 1 being unhappy and 10 being happiest ever). Preg-
nancy readiness was assessed by asking respondents to rate
their level of agreement with the following statement: ‘‘I
am ready to have a baby now’’.
We conducted exploratory latent class analyses to
identify dimensions of pregnancy intention using SAS Proc
LCA [17]. The number of classes was determined through
minimization of the Bayesian Information Criterion. The
LCA procedure estimated latent class parameters using the
expectation–maximization algorithm where the conver-
gence criterion was deﬁned as a maximum absolute devi-
ation of 0.000001. We created parsimonious scores to
capture the dimensions identiﬁed using the latent class
analysis with a stepwise elimination process. The process
was initiated by quantifying responses to individual ques-
tions and obtaining the sum of all relevant intention vari-
ables to produce a saturated score. Next, we eliminated the
variable which least impacted the observed agreement
between the saturated scores and the latent class dimen-
sions. We repeated the elimination step to minimize the
number of variables in the scores while maintaining a
substantial level of agreement with the latent classes.
Substantial agreement was deﬁned as a weighted kappa
exceeding 0.7.
Adverse pregnancy outcomes for the prospective anal-
ysis of pregnancy intention included preterm delivery
(gestational age \37 weeks), low birth weight (\2,500 g),
pregnancy complications, and operative delivery. Trained
research assistants reviewed prenatal and delivery records
to identify gestational age at delivery, birth weight, preg-
nancy complications, and mode of delivery. Operative
delivery included vacuum-assisted vaginal, forcep-assisted
vaginal, and cesarean delivery (primary or repeat). Pres-
ence of a pregnancy complication was identiﬁed by med-
ical record indication of pregnancy induced hypertension,
pre-eclampsia,
gestational
diabetes,
preterm
delivery,

preterm premature rupture of membrane, intrauterine
growth restriction, or spontaneous abortion. We had
insufﬁcient power to examine individual pregnancy com-
plications, consequently we created a binary indicator
representing the occurrence of at least one complication.
In addition to the adverse pregnancy outcomes, we
examined the following potential risk factors: inadequate
prenatal care, delayed ﬁrst prenatal care visit, no prenatal
vitamin use prior to ﬁrst prenatal care visit, recent smoking,
drinking since pregnant, recent drug use, and self reported
depression. Prenatal and delivery records were reviewed to
determine the number of prenatal care visits and the gesta-
tional age at ﬁrst visit. The Kotelchuck Adequacy of Prenatal
Care Utilization Index was calculated from the month of ﬁrst
prenatal visit, the number of visits, and gestational age at
delivery [18]. For the purpose of this analysis, the adequacy
of prenatal care was coded as adequate or inadequate.
Delayed prenatal care was deﬁned as a ﬁrst prenatal care visit
occurring after 13 weeks of gestation. Recent smoking was
deﬁned as smoking at least one cigarette within the 6-months
prior to the interview. Drinking since pregnant was deter-
mined by comparing self reported weeks since last drink to
the gestational age at the time of interview. If the last drink
was consumed after 2 weeks of gestation, participants were
categorized as drinking since pregnant. Recent drug use was
assessed by asking ‘‘Just before you found out you were
pregnant, were you using any drugs?’’ Assessment of
depression was based on participants’ response to the ques-
tion ‘‘Do you feel you are depressed?’’
All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.1 (SAS
Institute; Cary, NC). Descriptive covariates were summarized
by pregnancy intention dimensions using cross tabulations
and omnibus chi-square tests. To assess construct validity of
the parsimonious scores, we examined the associations
between intention and contraceptive use near the time of
conception (yes/no) and consideration of abortion. Associa-
tions between pregnancy intention dimensions and adverse
pregnancy risk factors and outcomes were quantiﬁed using
odds ratios from unadjusted and multivariable adjusted
logistic regressions. Adjusted regressions simultaneously
modeled each of the identiﬁed intention dimensions. Addi-
tional covariates were selected for inclusion in the multivar-
iable model if their inclusion altered the pregnancy intention
measures of association by more than 10%. Due to the het-
erogeneity of the outcomes assessed in this study, separate
multivariable models were developed for each outcome.
Results
The participants ranged in age from 12 to 19 years old,
with 21% under 16 years of age. Most were currently
enrolled in school (53%) and unmarried (93%) at the time
of their ﬁrst prenatal visit. For analyses of preterm birth,
low birth weight, and operative delivery, twenty-four
adolescents were excluded due to pregnancy loss or ter-
mination (n = 7), delivery at an outside hospital (n = 13),
or being lost to follow-up (n = 4).
The latent class analysis identiﬁed four classes of
pregnancy intention. Based on the response probabilities
within latent class categories and review of response pat-
terns, we characterized the classes as a 2-level measure of
planning and timing (hereafter referred to as planning) and
a 3-level measure of emotional response and readiness
(hereafter referred to as emotional readiness). Observed
classes included (1) planned and emotionally ready, (2)
unplanned and emotionally ready, (3) unplanned and dis-
crepant emotional readiness, and (4) unplanned and not
emotionally ready. The parsimonious score for ‘‘planning’’
had substantial agreement with the latent class planning
dimension (kappa = 0.84) and included the items ‘‘when
did you want to get pregnant?’’ and ‘‘I have been trying to
get pregnant’’. Pregnancies were categorized as unplanned
if respondents disagreed with the statement ‘‘I have been
trying to get pregnant’’, reported that they never wanted to
become pregnant, or were unsure how to respond to the
statement ‘‘I have been trying to get pregnant’’ and
reported that they wanted to get pregnant at later time. The
parsimonious score for emotional readiness had substantial
agreement with the latent class dimensions of emotional
readiness (weighted kappa = 0.74) and included items
‘‘How did you feel emotionally?’’ and ‘‘I am ready to have
a baby.’’ Participants were identiﬁed as ‘‘emotionally
ready’’ if they reported being happy in response to preg-
nancy and agreed with the statement ‘‘I am ready to have a
baby’’. Those who were unhappy and agreed with being
ready or happy and disagreed with being ready were cat-
egorized as ‘‘discrepant emotional readiness’’. Those who
reported being unhappy in response to their pregnancy and
disagreed or were unsure about the statement ‘‘I am ready
to have a baby’’ were categorized as being ‘‘not emotion-
ally ready’’. Using the parsimonious scores allowed us to
assess both classes of pregnancy intention using only 4 of
the 18 questions included in the latent class analysis.
Demographic, reproductive, and behavioral covariate
distributions were examined by level of the planning and
readiness scores (Table 1). Participants with pregnancies
characterized as ‘‘planned’’ (n = 41) were older than par-
ticipants
whose
pregnancies
were
characterized
as
‘‘unplanned’’ (n = 259). Prior pregnancy was reported by
51% of those with planned pregnancies and 26% of those
with unplanned pregnancies. Participants with planned
pregnancies also reported more sexual partners and sexu-
ally transmitted diseases as compared to those with
unplanned
pregnancies.

on self or partner’s earnings as compared to those who
were categorized as ‘‘discrepant emotional readiness’’
(n = 111) or ‘‘not emotionally ready’’ (n = 56).
We examined the distributions of responses to the
questions ‘‘have you considered having an abortion’’ and
‘‘Were you using birth control when you became pregnant’’

to assess the construct validity of the planning and emo-
tional readiness metrics. None of the adolescents catego-
rized as a planned and 25% (n = 64) of those categorize as
an unplanned pregnancy reported considering an abortion.
Emotional readiness was similarly associated with con-
sidering abortion; 8% (n = 11) of emotionally ready, 26%
(n = 29) of discrepant, and 43% (n = 24) of not emo-
tionally ready considered abortion. Birth control use at the
time of pregnancy was reported by 7% (n = 3) of planned
pregnancies and 25% (n = 64) of unplanned pregnancies.
We present unadjusted and multivariable adjusted odds
ratios for the association between our intention measures
and known risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes
(Table 2). After adjustment for potential confounders, the
estimates for the associations between pregnancy planning
and the known risk factors were not statistically signiﬁcant;
however, a suggestive association was observed between
planning and delayed prenatal care (OR = 2.36, 95%
CI = 1.00–5.61).
The analysis of emotional readiness and risk factors
revealed signiﬁcant associations. When compared with
those categorized as emotionally ready, pregnant teens who
were not emotionally ready had 2.7 (95% CI = 1.27–5.72)
times the odds of having inadequate prenatal care and 2.5
(95% CI = 1.27–5.09) times the odds of having delayed
prenatal care. The measures of association for recent
smoking and drug use were not stable enough to precisely
quantify the magnitude of the effect; however, the mag-
nitudes of the observed associations suggest that those
categorized as not emotionally ready had increased odds of
recent smoking and drinking. Participants who were not
emotionally ready had 2.2 times the odds of reporting to be
depressed as compared to those who were ready (95%
CI = 1.03–4.77). None of the effect estimates in the

analysis of adverse pregnancy outcomes approached sta-
tistical signiﬁcance (Table 3).
Discussion
Previous studies have suggested that current measures of
pregnancy intention do not adequately capture emotional
and psychological aspects of pregnancy intention [15, 19].
In our study investigating pregnancy intention among
adolescents, we took a broad approach to pregnancy
intention and delineated two signiﬁcant dimensions of
intention representing emotional readiness and planning.
The dimensions were distilled into accessible component
questions that have the potential to be used in clinical
settings after they have been further evaluated. While
neither of these dimensions of pregnancy intention were
statistically associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in
our cohort, we did observe signiﬁcant associations between
our pregnancy intention metrics and known risk factors for
poor outcomes. Of the two dimensions of pregnancy
intention we assessed, emotional readiness was more
strongly associated with risk factors for adverse pregnancy
outcomes. Pregnant teens identiﬁed as not emotionally
ready were at increased risk for delayed prenatal care,
inadequate prenatal care utilization, delayed use of prenatal
vitamins, recent smoking, recent drinking, recent drug use
and depression. This suggests that a traditional concept of
pregnancy intention may be less important than emotional
readiness among adolescents.
Regardless of pregnancy planning or emotional readi-
ness, the majority of adolescents included in this study
were not using contraception at the time of pregnancy. The
most common reasons for not contracepting among our
study participants included ‘‘I didn’t think I could get
pregnant’’ (46%) and ‘‘I didn’t want to use birth control’’
(52%). Though not directly asked, we believe that most had
access to contraception based on the observation that 80%
reported using contraception in the past. Reduction of
unintended pregnancies in this adolescent population may
be attained through providing further education on fertility
and by better understanding factors contributing to the
large percentage of adolescents who reported that they did
not want to use birth control.
The pregnancy intention dimensions evaluated in this
study were intended to help develop component questions
that could be used to screen high-risk teens in a clinical
setting. Though the initial intention dimensions were
identiﬁed using a total of 18 questions, we were able to
develop parsimonious scores relying on a smaller subset of
questions. To assess pregnancy planning and emotional
readiness, patients need only to respond to four questions
(‘‘When did you want to get pregnant?’’, ‘‘I have been
trying to get pregnant’’, ‘‘How did you feel emotionally?’’,
and ‘‘I am ready to have a baby.’’). Measures of planning
and readiness were correlated with use of birth control and
consideration of abortion, providing an indication of the
validity of these constructs. Future work should aim to
replicate the identiﬁed dimensions in other adolescent
populations.
The adolescent women included in this study may not be
representative of all adolescents at risk for pregnancy. This
study only enrolled pregnant teens attending prenatal care
prior to 24 weeks of gestation, thus this study does not

capture pregnant teens intending to terminate their preg-
nancy, pregnant teens with delayed prenatal care, or non-
pregnant teens. Prior studies in the general population of
adolescent women have reported that less than 5% of
adolescents want to become pregnant [20]. In our study
among adolescents seeking prenatal care, we observed that
approximately 15% of pregnancies were planned and 40%
of pregnant adolescents were emotionally ready. In addi-
tion to focusing on a study population in which intention
and readiness are likely to be higher than in the general
population,
participants
may
have
selected
response
options which were most socially appropriate. If this
occurred, we hypothesize that this would lead to an over-
estimation of pregnancy intention while biasing the asso-
ciation between adverse outcomes and pregnancy intention
towards the null. The perception of intention and the
association between pregnancy intention and adverse out-
comes may differ by ethnicity. Our study sample was
drawn from a source population in which a large proportion
of teen mothers were Hispanic in origin. We believe that
the metrics and associations reported in this paper are
informative to external populations; however, caution
should be taken when making inference to populations with
notably different ethnicity distributions.
Our analyses provides some evidence to support the
hypothesis that adolescents who are not emotionally ready
for their pregnancy have an increased risk of prenatal
depression. However, it is important to note that our
assessment of this association is cross-sectional in nature
and that both depression and readiness are assessed relying
on self reported measures. Given these limitations, the
reported association between readiness and depression
needs to be interpreted with some caution. Future studies
should aim to assess this association in a prospective
design with diagnosed depression to conﬁrm our results.
Our ability to detect associations between the intention
dimensions and adverse pregnancy outcomes may have
been hindered by unmeasured confounding and a lack of
outcome speciﬁcity. We observed that adolescents cate-
gorized as having a planned pregnancy were more likely to
have had a prior miscarriage. This observation is consistent
with what has been observed in population based studies
[21] and suggests that adolescents with planned and
unplanned pregnancies may differ in their baseline risk for
adverse pregnancy outcomes in the current pregnancy. We
considered prior miscarriage as a potential confounder;
however, data on other prior adverse pregnancy outcomes
were not available. Additionally, we had insufﬁcient power
to examine individual adverse pregnancy outcomes such as
low birth weight, pre-eclampsia, IUGR, fetal anomalies,
spontaneous abortion, or low Apgar score. We combined
several events to create the pregnancy complications out-
come; however, the heterogeneity of events included in our
combined pregnancy complications outcome may limit our
ability to observe a valid measure of association.
This study identiﬁed emotional readiness as a signiﬁcant
predictor of risk factors related to prenatal care, social
behaviors, and mental health. Furthermore, we observed
that the majority of adolescents reporting unintended
pregnancy were not using any method of contraception.
Identifying those adolescents who are not emotionally
ready may be an important screening tool in identifying
and intervening in high risk adolescent pregnancies. Future
research is needed with sufﬁcient power to assess the
association between these pregnancy intention measures
and adverse pregnancy outcomes and to further validate
these measures in other adolescent populations. Further-
more, subsequent studies should aim to extend the methods
implemented in this paper to non-pregnant adolescents and
pregnant adolescents intending to terminate their preg-
nancy. Contributions to our understanding of the relevant
components of pregnancy intention in teens may reveal
intervention opportunities to reduce high risk behaviors
and prevent adverse maternal and birth outcomes.
