Pregnancy Intention and Its Relationship to
Birth and Maternal Outcomes
A. P. Mohllajee, MPH, K. M. Curtis, PhD, B. Morrow, MA, and P. A. Marchbanks, PhD
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether there are associations
between pregnancy intention (intended, unwanted, mis-
timed, or ambivalent) and negative birth and maternal
outcomes: low birth weight (less than 2,500 g), preterm
delivery (fewer than 37 weeks), small for gestational age,
premature labor, hypertension, and other maternal out-
comes.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the population-based
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, including
87,087 women who gave birth between 1996 and 1999 in 18
states. Information on pregnancy outcomes was derived
from birth certificate data and a self-administered question-
naire completed postpartum. We employed SUDAAN (RTI
International, Research Triangle Park, NC) for univariable
and logistical regression analyses.
RESULTS: In analyses controlling for demographic and
behavioral factors, women with unwanted pregnancies had
an increased likelihood of preterm delivery (adjusted odds
ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.33) and
premature rupture of membranes (adjusted OR 1.37, 95%
CI 1.01–1.85) compared with women with intended preg-
nancies. Women who were ambivalent toward their preg-
nancies had increased odds of delivering a low birth weight
infant (adjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02–1.29); in contrast,
women with mistimed pregnancies had a lower likelihood
(adjusted OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–0.97).
CONCLUSION: Pregnancy
intention,
specifically
un-
wanted and ambivalent, may be an indicator of increased
risk for some poor birth and maternal outcomes and
should be considered in interventions aimed at improv-
ing the health of the mother and child.

LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III
I
n the United States, an estimated 49% of preg-
nancies in 2001 were unintended.1 An unin-
tended pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy that is
either unwanted or mistimed at the time of concep-
tion.2,3 Current definitions of unintended preg-
nancy also include women who are ambivalent
about their pregnancy.4 Unintended pregnancy is
associated with social and economic disadvantage
and maternal behaviors such as smoking, alcohol
consumption, and late initiation of prenatal care.5–8
Poor birth outcomes such as preterm delivery and
low birth weight are prevalent in the United States;
preterm delivery and low birth weight rates in 2002
were 12.1% and 7.8%, respectively, with the low
birth weight rate reaching the highest level reported
in three decades.9 Although several studies have
examined the associations between pregnancy in-
tention and birth outcomes, such as low birth
weight, preterm delivery, and small for gestational
age, the findings are inconsistent mainly due to
small sample size and lack of adjustment for strong
confounders.10–18
Although globally and in the United States, safe-
motherhood initiatives have drawn attention to the
prevalence of maternal mortality and morbidity, pop-
ulation-based data and research examining factors
associated with maternal morbidity are lacking. A
handful of studies have documented associations be-
tween pregnancy intention and other outcomes, such
as depression, physical abuse, and postpartum depres-
sion,19–21 but research focused specifically on the
relationship between unintended pregnancy and ma-
ternal outcomes is limited.

OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY

Because of the limited information about the
effect of pregnancy intention on birth and maternal
outcomes, this analysis aimed to examine the associ-
ation between pregnancy intention (intended, un-
wanted, mistimed, or ambivalent) and birth outcomes
(low birth weight, preterm delivery, and small for
gestational age) or maternal outcomes (nausea, kidney
or bladder infections, premature rupture of mem-
branes, vaginal bleeding, diabetes, high blood pres-
sure, premature labor, pregnancy complications, and
hospitalizations during pregnancy). If such an associ-
ation does exist, pregnancy intention may be an
additional factor that clinicians can use to identify
potential risk of poor pregnancy outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used data from the ongoing, population-based
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System,22,23
including 87,087 women who gave birth between
1996 and 1999 in 18 states, where survey response
rates were 70% or more. In each state, every month,
women who give birth are randomly chosen and sent
a self-administered questionnaire 2 to 6 months post-
partum. Women who fail to respond to the question-
naire after two attempts are offered a telephone
interview. Because the Pregnancy Risk Assessment
Monitoring System uses a stratified sampling process
that oversamples women with specific risks and char-
acteristics (eg, race), weights are created for this
oversampling scheme. Weights are also created for
nonresponse by examining factors that influence re-
sponse (eg, maternal age). The data are statistically
weighted to adjust for survey design, noncoverage,
and nonresponse, thereby creating a study population
that is representative of all female state residents who
had a live birth in the state during 1996 and 1999. The
self-administered questionnaire includes information
about maternal behaviors and experiences before and
during pregnancy. Data from the questionnaire are
linked to the birth certificate. Women whose pregnan-
cies ended in multiple births were excluded from this
analysis. The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring
System has been reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
Pregnancy intention was the main exposure of
interest and was assessed by the question, “Thinking
back to just before you got pregnant, how did you feel
about becoming pregnant?” Women who responded,
“I wanted to be pregnant sooner” or “I wanted to be
pregnant then” were categorized as intending the
pregnancy. Women who reported “I wanted to be
pregnant later” were labeled as having a mistimed
pregnancy. Women who responded “I didn’t want to
be pregnant then or at any time in the future” were
classified as having an unwanted pregnancy. Ambiv-
alence was defined as women who answered “I don’t
know.”
Data on birth outcomes came from birth certifi-
cates and included low birth weight (less than 2,500
g), preterm delivery (fewer than 37 weeks) and small
for gestational age (defined as birth weight below the
10th percentile for the infant’s gestational age based
on race and parity—specific standards only available
for white and African-American infants).24 The meth-
odology described by Whitehead et al25 was used for
determining the small for gestational age variable and
for excluding incompatible infant birth weights and
gestational ages. Odds ratios were calculated for
maternal morbidities based on data from the birth
certificate, the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitor-
ing System questionnaire, or a combination of both
data sources. The birth certificate provides only yes-
or-no information regarding whether women had
hypertension, vaginal bleeding, diabetes, premature
rupture of the membranes, premature labor, or no
complications at the time of the delivery. For the
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System ques-
tionnaire, women were asked if they had been hospi-
talized during their pregnancy. Women who an-
swered yes were then asked to select the reason why
they were hospitalized (premature labor, high blood
pressure, vaginal bleeding or placenta problems, nau-
sea, vomiting, dehydration, kidney or bladder infec-
tion, diabetes [high blood sugar], or other). While
some women were hospitalized for these conditions
during pregnancy, we do not know whether the
condition (eg, diabetes) existed before the pregnancy.
We combined the data for vaginal bleeding, diabetes,
and high blood pressure because they were available
from both the birth certificate and the Pregnancy Risk
Assessment Monitoring System questionnaire. We
also created three composite measures of maternal
outcome based on whether any maternal outcome
was reported only on the birth certificate, reported
only in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring
System, or reported on either the birth certificate or in
the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.
We employed SUDAAN (RTI International) for
univariable and logistical regression analyses of our
dependent variables: birth outcomes and maternal
morbidities. For analytic purposes, we chose an a
priori confounder set based upon the current litera-
ture on pregnancy intention and birth outcomes. We
used the same confounder set for all analyses, because
no one to our knowledge has studied the association

between pregnancy intention and maternal outcomes.
The logistic regression models included maternal age,
maternal race, maternal ethnicity, maternal educa-
tion, marital status, parity, prenatal care, previous low
birth weight infant or premature delivery, smoking
during the pregnancy, and drinking during the preg-
nancy as confounders. Given that we do not know the
true causal mechanism, we viewed these variables as
confounders.
RESULTS
In this population, 53.2% of women reported in-
tended pregnancies, 10.6% had unwanted pregnan-
cies, 30.2% had mistimed pregnancies, and 6.0% were
ambivalent about their pregnancies from 1996 to
1999 (Table 1). For poor birth outcomes, 5.9% of the
women had a low birth weight infant, 8.7% had a
preterm delivery, and 8.2% had a small for gestational
age infant (data not shown). The prevalence of poor
maternal outcomes was low overall but varied by type
of outcome; 3.8% of the women in the sample had
nausea, 2.2% had kidney or bladder infections, 2.5%
had premature rupture of membranes, 4.1% had
vaginal bleeding, 3.2% had diabetes, 6.4% had high
blood pressure, and 6.3% had premature labor (data
not shown). Based on birth certificate data, 11.3% had
one of the maternal outcomes and for the Pregnancy
Risk Assessment Monitoring System questionnaire,
13.0% of women were hospitalized for one of the
outcomes (data not shown). When combining the
birth certificate and the Pregnancy Risk Assessment
Monitoring System questionnaire data, 21.9% of
women had at least one of the maternal outcomes
(data not shown).
Women who had unintended (combining un-
wanted, mistimed, and ambivalent) pregnancies dif-
fered from women with intended pregnancies in
nearly all of the maternal characteristics and behav-
iors, birth outcomes, and maternal outcomes (Table
1). The distribution of birth and maternal outcomes
varied by levels of pregnancy intention, with women
who had an unwanted pregnancy differing signifi-
cantly from those who had an intended pregnancy on
a number of birth and maternal outcomes; however,
fewer differences were observed among women who
had mistimed pregnancies or who were ambivalent
about their pregnancies (Table 1).
In adjusted analyses (Table 2), women who re-
ported that they felt ambivalent toward their pregnan-
cies were more likely to have a low birth weight infant
than women with intended pregnancies (adjusted OR
1.15, 95% CI 1.02–1.29). Women with unwanted
pregnancies were at increased odds of preterm deliv-
ery (adjusted OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01–1.33) and pre-
mature rupture of membranes (adjusted OR 1.37,
95% CI 1.01–1.85). Women who had mistimed preg-
nancies were at decreased odds of having a low birth
weight infant (adjusted OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–0.97).
No other associations were observed between preg-
nancy intention and birth and maternal outcomes,
including the composite variable of maternal out-
comes from both Pregnancy Risk Assessment Moni-
toring System and birth certificate data.
DISCUSSION
Unintended pregnancy was highly prevalent in this
sample; nearly 50% of women reported an unin-
tended pregnancy. Prevalence of low birth weight in
our sample was similar to the national prevalence in
1999 (the time of this study); 5.9% of women in our
sample had a low birth weight infant compared with
6.0% of women delivering singletons nationally. Pre-
term rates were lower in our study: 8.7% in our
sample compared with 11.8% (includes multiple
births) nationally.26
We found that women who reported that their
pregnancies were unwanted had higher odds of pre-
term delivery, which is consistent with other stud-
ies.12,16 Women who reported they were ambivalent
about their pregnancies had higher odds of delivering
a low birth weight infant. However, women with
mistimed pregnancies were at decreased odds of
having a low birth weight infant, which is not consis-
tent with other studies.17,21,27 Overall, we found no
associations between pregnancy intention and mater-
nal outcomes, except for an association between
unwanted pregnancy and premature rupture of mem-
branes. Although these associations were statistically
significant, they may be of limited clinical significance
due to their relatively weak magnitude. In addition, it
is unclear whether pregnancy intention itself is a risk
factor for poor outcomes or whether it is simply a risk
marker for other variables that influence pregnancy
outcome, such as late initiation of prenatal care or
smoking or drinking during pregnancy.5,6,8,21,28
Previous studies have focused primarily on “un-
wanted” and “mistimed” pregnancies and have failed
to include women who were ambivalent about their
pregnancies16,17,27; however, in this analysis women
who were ambivalent about their pregnancy had
different risks for poor birth outcomes. We defined
ambivalence as women who responded “I don’t
know” to the question asking how they felt about the
timing of their pregnancy, but this does not capture
clearly the complex contradictory emotions that
women may have toward pregnancy. Ambivalence is

not a very well-understood construct and does not
have a standard measurement. However, those in the
field of unintended pregnancy have argued the need
to understand and assess ambivalence.29–31 Our anal-
ysis suggests that disaggregating those women who
are ambivalent from the overall group of women with
unwanted pregnancies may highlight a group of
women who have unique characteristics and risks.

Pregnancy Intention and Birth Outcomes
683

One of the main limitations in this study is the
retrospective assessment of pregnancy intention at the
time of conception. Several studies have shown that
women underreport unintended pregnancy when
asked about intention retrospectively, eg, a woman
may state that she did not intend to become pregnant
at the time of conception but then change her inten-
tion status after giving birth.32–34 Women’s recall of
pregnancy intention at the time of conception may be
influenced by experiences during pregnancy, deliv-
ery, and the postpartum period. Using data from the
National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, an analysis of
pregnancy intention during and after pregnancy has
shown that switching of intention does occur when
women
are
asked
retrospectively;
however
this
switching occurs in both directions: from unintended
to intended and intended to unintended. The authors
concluded that even with this switching, there is not
an underestimate or overestimate of the number of
unintended pregnancies or potential consequences of
unintendedness, including very low birth weight.33
Two studies that examined pregnancy intention pro-
spectively found that women who had unwanted
pregnancies were at a higher risk of premature labor,
which is consistent with our results.12,16
Misclassification of ambivalence may also be a
limitation. Women who responded to the mailed
questionnaire could read the all the response options
for the pregnancy intention question; women who
failed to answer the mailed questionnaire, but re-
sponded to the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitor-
ing System questionnaire by phone, were not explic-
itly given the option “I don’t know.” In this case, only
if a woman specifically stated that she did not know
was she labeled as being ambivalent. In these data,
18% of participants responded by phone. Women
participating by phone were less likely to respond “I
don’t know” than women participating by mail
(P.001). This may indicate misclassification of am-
bivalence; however, when we excluded women from
our analysis who responded by phone, the estimates
for ambivalence did not change substantially.
Another limitation may be an underestimation of
maternal morbidity based on the information from
birth certificate data and the Pregnancy Risk Assess-
ment Monitoring System. An analysis comparing
hospital discharge data, birth certificates, and Preg-
nancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System question-
naires showed low agreement between Pregnancy
Risk Assessment Monitoring System and birth certif-
icate records (Whitehead N, Callaghan W, Johnson
C, Williams L. Maternal Morbidity Surveillance:
Comparison of hospital discharge data, birth certifi-
cates, and confidential questionnaires [abstract]. Am J
Epidemiol 2004;159:S87). However, it is important to
note that Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring
System, discharge data, and birth certificates are
usually measuring different constructs. For example,
the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System
measure of high blood pressure includes preeclamp-
sia or toxemia, while in the birth certificate only
hypertension status is recorded. Pregnancy Risk As-
sessment Monitoring System data are based on
whether a woman recalls that she was hospitalized for
a certain condition and, therefore, most likely under-
estimates the number of women who experienced
one of the maternal outcomes. Furthermore, there is
no detailed information about the condition, for ex-
ample the type of diabetes. Birth certificates are more
likely to capture events at delivery, and the collection
process for the birth certificate data varies by hospital.
We decided in this analysis that since both have
shortcomings, it would be better to include the data
from both. Even if there is misclassification by using a
composite maternal outcome measure of the Preg-
nancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System and birth
certificate data, it is unlikely that misclassification
would differ by intention status. We conducted a
sensitivity analysis for the outcomes of vaginal bleed-
ing, diabetes, and hypertension to examine whether
the associations with pregnancy intention were differ-
ent when using only one source of data. The results
only changed substantially for hypertension among
pregnancies that were unwanted with a significant
association when using the Pregnancy Risk Assess-
ment Monitoring System data only.
Finally, some may argue that our results are an
artifact of conducting a number of comparisons;
however, all of our analyses were biologically plausi-
ble and based upon a priori hypotheses. We have
reported all of our associations, not just the subset that
was statistically significant.
The relationship between pregnancy intention
and maternal morbidities has been understudied. A
recent study emphasized that maternal morbidities
during labor and delivery are much more frequent
than previously thought and that elucidation of the
factors related to this burden is necessary35; more
research will be necessary to determine the validity of
our results. Our findings suggest that pregnancy in-
tention may be an indicator for increased risk of poor
outcomes, including low birth weight, preterm deliv-
ery, and premature rupture of the membranes. There-
fore, knowledge of pregnancy intention may help
clinicians provide the best possible care to their
patients.
