Abstract
Background: Pregnancy intention is important for maternal and child health outcomes. The purpose of this study
was to examine the causal relation between pregnancy intention and maternal depression and parenting stress in
Korean women who gave birth during 2008.
Methods: This study is a retrospective evaluation of prospectively collected data from the Panel Study on Korean
Children from 2008 to 2010. Causal analyses were conducted using propensity score matching and inverse probability
of treatment weighted methods. In addition, mediation analyses were performed to test mitigating effects of marital
conflict, fathers’ participation in childcare, and mothers’ knowledge of infant development on the relation between
unintended pregnancy and adverse maternal mental health.
Results: Results showed that the overall effect of an unintended pregnancy on maternal depression and parenting
stress was statistically significant. An unintended pregnancy was associated with 20–22% greater odds of maternal
depression, 0.28–0.39 greater depression score, and 0.85–1.16 greater parenting stress score. Relations between
pregnancy intention and maternal depression, maternal depression score and parenting stress score were moderately
explained by marital conflict and fathers’ participation in childcare.
Conclusions: Unintended pregnancy contributed to increased risks of maternal depression and parenting stress. Efforts
to increase fathers’ participation in childcare and decrease marital conflict might be helpful to mitigate adverse impacts
of unintended pregnancy on perinatal maternal mental health.

Background
An unintended pregnancy may be an unwanted pregnancy
(did not want to be pregnant at all) or a mistimed pregnancy
(pregnancy occurred earlier than wanted), and the term is
used interchangeably with unplanned pregnancy [1,2].
Pregnancy intent is an important determinant of both
short- and long-term maternal and child health outcomes
[3]. Pregnancy intention may affect attitudes and behaviors
in parenting and eventually have an impact on child devel-
opment. Compared to pregnant women with pregnancy
intention, pregnant women without pregnancy intention
had greater exposure to cigarette smoking, drinking
alcohol, taking medications and illicit drugs, and X-ray
during pregnancy, and were less likely to take folic acid
and attend antenatal care [4-6]. If the pregnancy was
intended, babies had a greater likelihood of prolonged
breastfeeding and receiving proper vaccinations [7,8]. Preg-
nancy intention also has long-term influences on child
health. Children born after unintended pregnancy showed
a cognitive delay at 3-years-old, more behavioral problems
at 5- and 7-years-old, and increased problem behaviors
and substance use at 14-years-old than their counterparts
[9-11]. Unwanted births may also cause poor relations be-
tween mother and offspring, even after the child has be-
come an adult [12]. Cleland and colleagues argued that
preventing unintended pregnancy by providing family-
planning services free of charge is a cost-effective prevent-
ive care service [13].

Unintended pregnancy rates vary by country and year,
and across sub-populations [14,15]. Singh and colleague
estimated that 41% of all pregnancies that occurred world-
wide in 2008 were unintended, and the regional preva-
lence of unintended pregnancies ranged from 30% to 58%
[15]. In South Korea (hereafter ‘Korea’), the prevalence of
planned pregnancies reported by hospital- and/or com-
munity health center-based studies ranges from 51.4% to
74.3% [6,16,17]. A nationwide survey in 2008, the Panel
Study on Korean Children (PSKC), reported that 74.3% of
pregnancies were intended [16].
An unintended pregnancy is a risk factor for poor
maternal mental health including perinatal depression,
stress, and lower levels of psychological well-being and
life satisfaction [4,18-22]. An unintended pregnancy in-
creases the risk of maternal depression [22-25] and par-
enting stress [4,26]. However, most prior studies of the
consequences of an unintended pregnancy on maternal
health were cross-sectional, and few studies were con-
ducted in Asian countries. More importantly, a causal rela-
tion between unintended pregnancy and maternal mental
health has not been established. Gipson and colleagues
argued that the relation between an unintended pregnancy
and maternal and child outcomes may be confounded
by many factors, including socioeconomic status, and
highlighted the need for well-designed studies that provide
information on causality [3]. A randomized controlled study
on the relation between pregnancy intention and maternal
and child outcomes is not possible for ethical reasons.
One alternative approach to investigate a causal relation is
to perform causal analysis using observational data, such
as propensity score matching (PSM) [27].
In this study, we examined the causal relation between
pregnancy intention and maternal mental health (mater-
nal depression and parenting stress) by employing PSM
and inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW)
analyses. We used nationally representative, prospective
birth cohort data collected in Korea from 2008 to 2010,
and we used repeated measures of maternal mental health
obtained over the study period. We hypothesized that un-
intended pregnancy would have a strong adverse effect on
maternal mental health in the early stages of postpartum
but that the strength of this effect would diminish with
time. This hypothesis was partly based on our assumption
that unintended pregnancy may cause short-term adverse
mental health problems because of its nature, i.e., unin-
tended pregnancy being an unexpected incident and bur-
den in the mother’s life, but that growing mother-infant
attachment and intimacy after birth would minimize this
initial effect. This hypothesis was also partly based on lit-
erature showing an effect of pregnancy intention on ante-
natal and postpartum maternal mental health [4,18,21,23]
but no effect of pregnancy intention on maternal men-
tal health in later stages of parenting [28-30]. We also
hypothesized that marital conflict, fathers’ participation in
childcare, and mothers’ knowledge of infant development
would mediate the relation between pregnancy intention
and maternal mental health. This second hypothesis is
supported by prior studies on the effects of such media-
tors on maternal mental health [31,32].
Methods
Data
We used publicly available data from the 2008–2010
PSKC conducted by the Korea Institute of Child Care
and Education. The PSKC is a longitudinal survey on a
representative national sample of children born between
April and July 2008 and their parents. Participants were
recruited from 30 sampled hospitals across the country.
The first wave of PSKC was conducted in 2008, and
follow-up surveys have been performed annually. The
initial interview was face-to-face and was conducted at the
time of childbirth in the hospital. A subsequent telephone
survey (the second survey of the first wave of PSKC) was
conducted at 1 month postpartum. The third survey was
initiated and conducted at the participant’s home at
4 months postpartum. The mean time of the third survey
was 5.6 months after birth (standard deviation (SD) =
1.2 months). These three surveys (at birth, 1 month post-
partum, and 4 months postpartum) were conducted in
2008 and comprise the first wave of PSKC. The second
and third waves of PSKC were face-to-face interviews
conducted in the participant’s home at 1 year postpartum
(mean = 14.1 months; SD = 1.1 months) and 2 years post-
partum (mean = 25.8 months; SD = 1.4 months). The num-
ber of responding families was 2,078 in the first wave, 1,904
in the second wave, and 1,802 in the third wave. This study
was approved by the Asan Medical Center Institutional
Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained
from each participant at the time of recruitment by the
Korea Institute of Child Care and Education.
Pregnancy intention
Pregnancy intention was determined in the initial inter-
view (i.e., the first survey of the first wave) by asking the
mother “Did you and your husband (or partner) plan the
pregnancy or want to have the baby?” Response categor-
ies were: 1) only I as the mother of the baby planned or
wanted the pregnancy, 2) only my husband (or partner)
as the father of the baby planned or wanted the preg-
nancy, 3) both my husband (or partner) and I planned
or wanted the pregnancy, and 4) neither my husband (or
partner) nor I planned or wanted the pregnancy. In this
study, we focused on the mother’s intention, as we viewed
this as more directly related to maternal mental health
than the father’s intention. Therefore, we grouped re-
sponses 1) and 3) as intended pregnancy, and responses
2) and 4) as unintended pregnancy.

Depression
Maternal depression was assessed using the Kessler
6-Item Psychological Distress Scales (K6). The K6 is a
short screening instrument for mental illness in the gen-
eral population. In the PSKC, the response to each of the
six items was scored on an ordinal scale from 1 to 5, and
the total score ranged from 6 to 30. An additional file
shows full questionnaires [see Additional file 1]. The reli-
ability of the K6 is high (Cronbach alpha = 0.89) [33]. Sub-
jects scoring ≥14 were classified as depressed [34-36].
Maternal depression was measured five times during the
study period: at the time of childbirth, and at 1 month,
4 months, 1 year and 2 years postpartum). The survey
conducted at the time of childbirth asked mothers about
their feelings during the 1 month prior to giving birth
(antenatal depression), and the surveys conducted at
1 month, 4 months, 1 year and 2 years postpartum asked
mothers about their feelings during the preceding 30 days.
The same six items and response categories were used
throughout the study period.
Parenting stress
The mothers’ parenting stress was measured with ten
questions on perceived difficulties and distress in taking
care of the baby and performing parental roles (see ques-
tionnaires in Additional file 1). These ten questions origi-
nated from a Korean study [37] and were developed based
on the Parenting Stress Index [38-40], Parenting Daily
Hassles [41], and Maternal Guilt Scale [42]. The reliability
of the questions is high (Cronbach alpha = 0.88) [37]. The
ten items focus on negative psychological states that arise
from parenting demands. Each of ten items is scored on a
five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The total score
ranges from 10 to 50, with higher scores indicating greater
maternal parenting stress [37]. Parenting stress was mea-
sured at three time points during the study period:
4 months, 1 year, and 2 years postpartum. The same ten
items and response categories were used throughout the
study period.
Mediators
We selected three variables as potential mediators of the
relation between pregnancy intention and maternal men-
tal health: marital conflict, father’s participation in child-
care, and mother’s knowledge on infant development.
Mediators evaluated by the mother at 4 months postpar-
tum were used in the analysis.
Marital conflict
We hypothesized that women with an unintended preg-
nancy may experience marital conflict with their husband
that was related to unexpected pregnancy, and therefore
were more likely to experience marital conflict than women
with an intended pregnancy. Marital conflict was evaluated
using the Korean version of the marital conflict index
(see questionnaires in Additional file 1), which con-
sists of eight items regarding conflictual situations in-
cluding escalation, invalidation, negative interpretations,
withdrawal and avoidance between couples. This index
was derived from Markman et al.’s relation dynamics scale
[43] translated by Chung [44]. The reliability of the index
is high (Cronbach alpha = 0.96) [44]. Each item is scored
on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The total
score ranges from 8 to 40, with higher scores indicating a
greater level of marital conflict.
Fathers’ participation in childcare
We hypothesized that women with an intended preg-
nancy would report greater participation of the father in
childcare than women with an unintended pregnancy.
The mother was asked about the cooperation of the
child’s father in childcare using four items from the hus-
band’s family role performance questionnaire developed
by Hong [45] that were extracted by a previous study [46].
Each item is scored on a five-point Likert scale ranging
from 1 to 5. The total score ranges from 4 to 20, with
higher scores indicating more involvement of the child’s
father in childcare. The reliability of the questions is high
(Cronbach alpha = 0.86) [33].
Knowledge of infant development
We hypothesized that women with an intended pregnancy
would be more likely to gather information on infant de-
velopment than women with an unintended pregnancy,
and thus would be more knowledgeable on infant devel-
opment than women with an unintended pregnancy.
Knowledge of infant development was assessed using the
Knowledge of Infant Development Inventory, which was
developed to measure the mothers’ knowledge of child-
rearing and child development [47]. The original Know-
ledge of Infant Development Inventory consists of four
sub-sections: norms and milestones, parenting strategies,
principles of development, and health and safety. The
PSKC used 13 items from the principles of development
sub-section. Mothers responded to each item by yes or
no, or reporting they were not sure. Total score was com-
puted by the sum of the number of items correctly
answered.
Socio-demographic characteristics
Socio-demographic characteristics evaluated at 4 months
postpartum (baseline) were used in the analysis. Maternal
and paternal education were categorized as high school or
under, junior college, or university or over. Maternal occu-
pation was categorized as non-manual, manual, or house-
wife/other, and paternal occupation was categorized as
non-manual or manual. Household income was adjusted
for family size and then divided into quintiles. Maternal

and paternal cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking be-
haviors (yes or no) were also assessed at 4 months post-
partum. The sex and birth order (first born vs. later born)
of the infant were also recorded.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and per-
centages and were compared across women with intended
pregnancies and women with unintended pregnancies
using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. Continuous
variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD)
and were compared across women with intended preg-
nancies and women with unintended pregnancies using
Student’s unpaired t-test. Logistic and linear regression
analyses were conducted for each time point to evaluate
the effect of pregnancy intention on each outcome, and
generalized linear mixed models were used to examine
time trends in the effects of pregnancy intention.
PSM and IPTW were used for causal analyses. Propen-
sity score analysis and regression based approaches can be
used to estimate treatment effects in observational data.
Several advantages of propensity score analysis over re-
gression based approaches exist. For example, propensity
score analysis can be used to reduce or eliminate the
effects of confounding when using observational data to
estimate treatment effects [27]. To reduce the effect of se-
lection bias and potential confounding, differences in base-
line characteristics (maternal age, paternal age, infant’s sex,
infant’s birth order, maternal education, paternal education,
maternal occupation, paternal occupation, household in-
come, maternal smoking, paternal smoking, maternal al-
cohol consumption, paternal alcohol consumption) were
adjusted using weighted generalized linear mixed models
with inverse probability of treatment weighting [48]. With
this technique, weights for women with unintended preg-
nancy were the inverse of the propensity score and
weights for women with intended pregnancy were the in-
verse of 1 - propensity score. The propensity score is the
probability, given baseline variables, that any participant
in either group would be selected for unintended preg-
nancy. The propensity scores were estimated without re-
gard to outcomes by multiple logistic regression analysis.
A full non-parsimonious model was developed that in-
cluded all variables shown in Table 1. Model discrimin-
ation was assessed with C statistics (C = 0.618) and model
calibration was assessed with Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics
(p = 0.3340). The results of IPTW were verified by PSM.
The propensity score-matched pairs (one-to one match-
ing) were created by matching women with unintended
and intended pregnancies on the logit of the propensity
score using calipers of width equal to 0.2 of the SD of the
logit of the propensity score. After propensity score
matching, we examined the similarity of women with un-
intended and intended pregnancies in the propensity
score-matched sample by calculating standardized differ-
ences for each of the baseline variables listed in Table 1.
All of the standardized differences for each of the baseline
variables were less than 0.06 (6%) (See Additional file 1:
Table S1). Mediation analyses were conducted to test
the hypotheses that marital conflict, fathers’ participa-
tion in childcare, and mothers’ knowledge of infant
development mediated the relation between pregnancy
intention and outcomes. The role of mediators in the
relation between pregnancy intention and the pres-
ence of maternal depression was evaluated using the
percentage excess odds explained by inclusion of the
mediators in the model, which was calculated as
(ORbaseline model – ORbaseline model + mediators)/(ORbaseline
model – 1) [49]. Similarly, the role of mediators in the rela-
tion between pregnancy intention and maternal de-
pression score and parenting stress score was evaluated
using the percentage excess beta explained by inclu-
sion of the mediators in the model, which was calcu-
lated as (Betabaseline model – Betabaseline model + mediators)/
(Beta baseline model). This excess odds or beta explained the
degree to which a mediator explains the relation between
pregnancy intention and maternal mental health. All stat-
istical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.1 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). A two-tailed value of p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Table 1 shows the neonatal and socio-demographic char-
acteristics of study subjects according to pregnancy
intention. Of 2076 pregnancies, 525 (25.3%) were unin-
tended. The prevalence of unintended pregnancy was sig-
nificantly higher among later-born infants, fathers with a
manual job, lower household income, and fathers who
were smokers than their counterparts (Table 1).
Figure 1 shows the prevalence of maternal depression
(Figure 1a), the maternal depression score (Figure 1b),
and the parenting stress score (Figure 1c) according to
pregnancy intention over the study period. In both groups,
the prevalence of maternal depression and the average
maternal depression score decreased shortly after delivery
(at 1 month postpartum) and then returned to the ante-
natal level at 3 months postpartum (Figure 1a and b). At
the first four time points, women with an unintended
pregnancy had a higher prevalence of depression than
women with an intended pregnancy, but this difference
had disappeared by the final time point (2 years postpar-
tum; Figure 1a). However, the difference of prevalence of
depression between two groups was not statistically sig-
nificant over the study period. At 4 months postpartum,
the depression score was higher in women with an unin-
tended pregnancy than in women with an intended preg-
nancy (p = 0.0397; Figure 1b). At 4 months, 1 year and
2 years postpartum, the parenting stress score was higher

in women with an unintended pregnancy than in women
with an intended pregnancy (p = 0.0351, p = 0.0113, p =
0.0043), and in both groups the parenting stress score in-
creased at 2 years postpartum (Figure 1c).
Table 2 shows the scores for marital conflict, fathers’
participation in childcare, and mothers’ knowledge of infant
development in women with intended and unintended
pregnancy. Women with an unintended pregnancy re-
ported significantly greater levels of marital conflict than
women with an intended pregnancy and lower participation
of the child’s father in childcare. Women with an unin-
tended pregnancy showed a tendency for lower knowledge
of infant development than their counterparts, but the dif-
ference was not statistically significant.
Tables 3 and 4 show the results of PSM and IPTW
analyses. The odds ratios for maternal depression varied
over the survey period and, in PSM analysis, were statis-
tically significant at the early time points (antenatal and
the first month postpartum) but not at the 1 and 2 year
postpartum time points. However, the interaction be-
tween pregnancy intention and time point was not sta-
tistically significant in the PSM nor the IPTW analyses
(p = 0.1819, p = 0.2402). The overall effect of an unin-
tended pregnancy on the presence of maternal depression
was statistically significant in both analyses, with an unin-
tended pregnancy associated with 22% or 20% greater
odds of maternal depression in PSM and IPTW analyses,
respectively (Table 3). We conducted additional analysis
to calculate the difference in maternal depression score ac-
cording to pregnancy intention. Additional file 1: Table S3)
shows the results of PSM and IPTW analyses for maternal
depression score, and the findings were similar as those for
the presence of maternal depression. Maternal depression
score was higher in women with unintended pregnancy
than in women with intended pregnancy at the early time
points (antenatal depression score in PSM analysis, and
1 month and 4 months postpartum depression scores in
the IPTW analysis). The interaction between pregnancy
intention and time point was not statistically significant.
The overall effect of an unintended pregnancy on maternal
depression score was statistically significant (Additional
file 1: Table S3).
Table 4 shows the results of PSM and IPTW analyses
for parenting stress scores. In contrast to the findings
for the presence of maternal depression and maternal de-
pression score, the differences in parenting stress score
between groups was statistically significant throughout the
study periods, and the interaction between pregnancy
intention and time point was not statistically significant.
There was a statistically significant overall effect of preg-
nancy intention on parenting stress scores in both PSM
and IPTW analyses (Table 4).
Table 5 presents the results of analyses on the role of
marital conflict, fathers’ participation in childcare, and
mothers’ knowledge of infant development on the relation
between pregnancy intention and maternal mental health.
In both PSM and IPTW analysis, odds ratios decreased
with adjustments for the three potential mediators. The
overall percent reduction for maternal depression after
adjusting for mediators was 71.4% in PSM analysis. Across
all time points, the mediators explained 26.0% (PSM) and
27.2% (IPTW) of the relation between pregnancy intention
and parenting stress score (Table 5). The mediators ex-
plained 32.1% (PSM) and 33.1% (IPTW) of the relation be-
tween pregnancy intention and parenting stress score at
1 year postpartum, and 19.3% (PSW) and 21.5% (IPTW)
of the relation between pregnancy intention and parenting
stress score at 2 years postpartum. In addition, Additional
file 1: Table S5) shows that, across all time points, the
mediators explained 81.5% (IPTW) of the relation be-
tween pregnancy intention and maternal depression score
(Additional file 1: Table S5).
The role of each mediator in the relation between un-
intended pregnancy and maternal mental health is shown
in the Additional file 1: Table S6-8). In general, marital con-
flict was a stronger mediator than fathers’ participation in
childcare and mothers’ knowledge of infant development.
The role of knowledge of infant development was minimal.

Discussion
The results of this study showed that an absence of
intention for a pregnancy had an adverse effect on ma-
ternal depression and parenting stress, and that the rela-
tion between pregnancy intention and maternal mental
health was partly mediated by marital conflict, fathers’
participation in child care, and mothers’ knowledge of
infant development. These findings were obtained from
causal analyses (PSM and IPTW) of longitudinal follow-
up data obtained from a national sample of an Asian
population. Many prior investigations have reported an
association between unintended pregnancy and maternal
mental health [4,18,21,23,50], but the associations were
often assumed to be non-causal or due to confounding
variables [3]. The results of our PSM and IPTW analyses
provide support for a causal relation between pregnancy
intention and maternal mental health in a non-Western
population.
We hypothesized that the magnitude of the relation
between pregnancy intention and maternal mental health
would decrease with time. The results of this study showed
statistically significant differences in the prevalence of ma-
ternal depression according to pregnancy intention at the
first three time points (from antenatal to 4 months post-
partum), but no difference at 1 year or 2 years postpartum.
These results support our hypothesis, although there was
no significant interaction between pregnancy intention and
the time of inquiry on the prevalence of maternal depres-
sion or the maternal depression score, this might be due to
fluctuating non-linear patterns in the effect of pregnancy
intention on maternal depression over the five time points.
Several international studies have reported an increased
risk of antenatal and postpartum depression for women
with unintended pregnancy [4,18,21,23]. Most of these
studies examined postpartum depression from a few days
to 9 months postpartum, but a few studies have explored
the long-term effect of pregnancy intention on postpar-
tum depression. Christensen and colleagues reported that
the difference in mean depressive symptom score between
low-income Hispanic women with intended and unin-
tended pregnancies was lower at 12 months postpartum
than at 4 months postpartum [28], and an Australian
study reported that the impact of pregnancy intention on
maternal depression diminished over the perinatal period
[30]. These studies showed abating trend, which is similar
to our results.
In this study, we found that women with an unintended
pregnancy reported higher levels of parenting stress over
the study period. An Irish cohort study reported that
women with unintended pregnancy were more likely to

have a high parenting stress level at 9 months postpartum
than women with intended pregnancy [4]. A U.S. study ex-
plored the parenting stress of mothers when the child was
approximately one-year-old according to whether or not
they considered aborting the pregnancy, and reported that
mothers who considered an abortion had a higher parent-
ing stress score than women who did not consider an
abortion [51]. Another U.S. study reported that women
who had a later-born child with an unplanned pregnancy
tended to experience more parenting stress than women
who had a later-born child with a planned pregnancy over
the first 3 years after childbirth [50]. These studies showed
similar results to our study that the relation between preg-
nancy intention and parenting stress lasted for a couple of
years.
We hypothesized that the magnitude of the relation
between
pregnancy
intention
and
maternal
mental
health would decrease with time. One of the challenges
that arises from our findings is to explain why the effect
of pregnancy intention on maternal depression dimin-
ished with time but the differences in parenting stress
did not. These differences might be due to the differences
in the nature of the two measures. The questions on ma-
ternal depression measure the internal emotional status of
mothers, whereas the questions on parenting stress are
more closely related to external sources of stressors such
as economic burden and childcare hassles. The presence
of external stressors associated with unintended preg-
nancy and subsequent childbirth may have a sustained ef-
fect on parenting stress, in contrast to internal emotional
problems caused by unintended pregnancy, which dimin-
ish with time. The results of this study suggest that mater-
nal depression and parenting stress are both important
aspects of maternal mental health that are associated
with unintended pregnancy and that they may affect
childcare and child development in the first year after
birth, but beyond the first postpartum year, reducing
parenting stress should be the focus for women with
unintended pregnancy. Further study is needed to confirm
these findings.
We hypothesized that marital conflict, fathers’ partici-
pation in child care, and mothers’ knowledge of infant
development would mediate the relation between preg-
nancy intention and maternal mental health. Our results
showed that the relation between pregnancy intention and
maternal mental health was partially explained by these
variables. This supports a previous study that marital rela-
tion was a significant predictor of postpartum depression
[31]. Our analysis showed that pregnancy intention was
strongly associated with marital conflict, and that marital
conflict explained more of the relation between pregnancy
intention and maternal mental health than either of the
other two mediators. These results suggest that uninten-
tional pregnancies may have an adverse effect on later
maternal mental health as they brought about marital
conflict and lowered the fathers’ participation in childcare,
which eventually contributed to perinatal depression and
parenting stress in mothers. A mother’s knowledge of
infant development affects her confidence of infant care
[31,32]. However, our analysis showed that a mother’s
knowledge of infant development had a minimal role as
mediator of the relation between pregnancy intention and
maternal mental health. This is partly because the mother’s
knowledge of infant development was not strongly related
to pregnancy intention.
Another interesting question from this study would be
what additional variables mediate the relation between
pregnancy intention and maternal mental health. The
three mediators examined in this study explained ap-
proximately 26-27% of the relation between unintended
pregnancy and parenting stress, and a future challenge is
to identify the additional variables that mediate the rela-
tion between pregnancy intention and postpartum par-
enting stress. Candidate variables are problems related
to unpreparedness for giving birth, such as monetary
preparedness. However, several socioeconomic status

variables were considered in the analyses. Further re-
search is required to identify potential mediators.
In this study, results showed that pregnancy intention
had an effect on maternal mental health, however, it
should be noted that the attributable risk for pregnancy
intention on maternal mental health would not be great.
For example, overall odds ratios of pregnancy intention
on maternal depressive symptoms were 1.20-1.22 and
the value of Cohen’s d for parenting stress scores in each
year ranged from 0.20 to 0.25. Thus, even though three
mediators explained more than one-fourth of the magni-
tude of the relationship between unintended pregnancy
and parenting stress, the absolute reduction of odds and
beta by mediators would be small, considering the rela-
tively small impact of pregnancy intention on maternal
mental health in the baseline model.
In this study, the prevalence of maternal depression
and the maternal depression score were lower in the first
month postpartum than in the antenatal period (measured
immediately after birth). It is uncertain why maternal de-
pression decreased in the first month postpartum, when
postpartum blues and postpartum depression are preva-
lent. However, it should be noted that the survey related
to the first month postpartum was conducted via tele-
phone, but the other surveys were conducted via face-to-
face interviews. Mothers might have better disclosed their
emotional problems in face-to-face interviews than in tele-
phone surveys. The parenting stress score increased from
4 months to 2 years postpartum, and the increase was due
to an increases in the scores for the following questions:
“I feel bad because it seems to be my fault when my
baby appears emotionally unstable”, “I have difficulty be-
ing friendly and warm toward my child”, and “I get irri-
tated if my child pesters me to play with him or her when
I am tired”. These three questions accounted for 62.6% of
the increase in parenting stress score (data not shown).
High scores on these questions indicate a dysfunctional
parent–child interaction. An interactive mother-child rela-
tion might strengthen the attachment and intimacy, and
affect the child’s emotional development.
In this study, we only focused on the mother’s intention.
When we conducted sensitivity analysis using different ap-
proaches to pregnancy intention (unintended by mother,
unintended by mother and father, and unintended by
mother or father), the results were generally similar, but
the interaction between pregnancy intention and time of
inquiry for depressive symptoms was statistically signifi-
cant in PSM analysis when the pregnancy was unin-
tended by mother or father (see Additional file 1:
Table S9). Most prior studies used maternal pregnancy
intentions [3], however, further studies are needed to
explore consequences of disagreement on pregnancy
intention between partners or the role of partner’s in-
tentions on maternal mental health.
This study has limitations. First, the question on preg-
nancy intention did not distinguish if the pregnancy
was unwanted, mistimed, or unplanned, and pregnancy
intention was assessed after delivery. Pregnancy intentions
can be viewed as a spectrum and thus may be measured
with continuous variables to capture doubt about clearly
defined intention of pregnancy [52]. In 2005, the esti-
mated induced abortion rate in Korea was 29.8 per 1000
women, and women with unwanted pregnancies were
more likely to terminate their pregnancy with induced
abortion; therefore, the rate of unintended pregnancy may
be underestimated [53,54]. Second, antenatal depression
was not assessed during pregnancy but was examined
shortly after the birth of a child, when women were asked
questions regarding the 30 days prior to giving birth. The
antenatal depression status may therefore be inaccurate
and may hamper causality for the relationship between
unintended pregnancy and antenatal depression. Third,
perinatal depression was measured with the K6 and not
with structured clinical interview or another more popular
tool; therefore, caution should be exercised when compar-
ing our results with other studies. Fourth, women with
mental health problems might be more likely to have un-
intended pregnancy than women without mental health
problems. Hall and colleagues showed that, among young
women aged 18–20 years with no intention of pregnancy,
women with stress or depression and stress at baseline
had higher risks of pregnancy over the course of 1 year
[55]. A longitudinal study showed that males and females
who had depressive symptoms in their adolescent pe-
riods were more likely to report an unintended first
birth between the ages of 18 and 24 [56]. The insuffi-
cient contraception might be related to the risk of unin-
tended pregnancy among depressed women. Women with
elevated depression and stress were more likely to be at
risk for inconsistent contraceptive use [57]. Although we
employed causal analyses in this study, we cannot com-
pletely exclude the possibility of this reverse causation
because we did not assess pre-conception mental health
status.
This study has several strengths. We used a prospective
cohort data from a nationally representative sample of a
non-Western population. Many of the existing studies on
the adverse effect of unintended pregnancy were con-
ducted in a Western population [3]. We used longitudinal
data assessed by repeated observations, with consistent
measurement of maternal depression and parenting stress
for two years after childbirth, and we conducted analysis
using PSM and IPTW, which allowed us to reduce con-
founding effects and estimate causal effects based on the
assumption that there is no unmeasured confounders
[58,59]. We also provide evidence on the role of mediators
in the relation between pregnancy intention and maternal
mental health.

Conclusions
The results suggested that reducing unintended preg-
nancy as well as increasing fathers’ participation in child-
care and decreasing marital conflict might be helpful in
improving maternal mental health. Future studies should
examine longer term effects of unintended pregnancy on
maternal mental health.
