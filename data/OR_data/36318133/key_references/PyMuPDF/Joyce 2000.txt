THE EFFECT OF PREGNANCY INTENTION ON CHILD DEVELOPMENT*

wanted pregnancy, it is also clear that the committee foresaw
additional benefits related to improvements in infant and
child development. In this paper we are primarily interested
in whether the reported association between unintended preg-
nancy and infant and child development is causal. We argue
that existing evidence for a causal relationship is weak. In
particular, past studies did not control adequately for poten-
tial confounding effects of family and social background.
Unintended pregnancy is correlated with income, race, mari-
tal status, education, cognitive ability, and other parental
characteristics, all of which are also related to prenatal be-
havior, child health, and child development. Policies in-
tended to enhance infants’ and children’s well-being may be
advanced more effectively if they are based on a causal as
opposed to an associative relationship.
Our objective therefore is to investigate empirically the
causal link between unintended pregnancy and child health
and development, as well as parental behaviors related to
child health and development. In contrast to previous stud-
ies, we include an extensive set of controls in our empirical
analysis to minimize potential confounding. In addition, we
exploit information on siblings to control for unobserved fac-
tors both in child outcomes and in pregnancy intention.
A second motivation for our study is the paucity of re-
search on the effect of pregnancy intention on child devel-
opment. Most prior research based on data for the United
States has focused on birth outcomes and on prenatal and
perinatal behaviors. Only one previous study has examined
the consequences of unintended childbearing for the devel-
opment of children beyond infancy (Baydar 1995). Euro-
pean researchers, by contrast, have analyzed the long-term
consequences of mistimed or unwanted pregnancies on em-
ployment, schooling, and social adjustment, and often have
found significant adverse effects (Kubicka et al. 1995;
Myhrman et al. 1995). We examine whether pregnancy in-
tention affects the health and development of children up to
11 years of age.
PREVIOUS STUDIES
Research on the consequences of unintended pregnancy in
the United States has focused primarily on infant health, es-
pecially birth weight, and on maternal behaviors that affect
infant health, such as smoking during pregnancy and the use
of prenatal care (Bustan and Coker 1994; Kost, Forrest, and
Singh undated; Marsiglio and Mott 1988; Sable et al. 1997;
Weller, Eberstein, and Bailey 1987). These studies typically
find evidence that unintended pregnancy has an adverse ef-
fect on maternal behaviors and use of prenatal care, but they
In this paper, we use data from the National Longitudinal Sur-
vey of Youth to investigate the empirical link between unintended
pregnancy and child health and development. An important contri-
bution of our study is the use of information on siblings to control
for unmeasured factors that may confound estimates of the effect of
pregnancy intentions on infant and child outcomes. Results from our
study indicate that unwanted pregnancy is associated with prenatal
and postpartum maternal behaviors that adversely affect infant and
child health, but that unwanted pregnancy has little association with
birth weight and child cognitive outcomes. Estimates of the associa-
tion between unwanted pregnancy and maternal behaviors were
greatly reduced after controls for unmeasured family background
were included in the model. Our results also indicate that there are
no significant differences in maternal behaviors or child outcomes
between mistimed and wanted pregnancies.
n 1988, 56% of pregnancies were unintended, either mis-
timed or unwanted at conception (Forrest 1994). The conse-
quences of unintended pregnancy are thought to be substan-
tial: Unintended pregnancy has been shown to be associated
with late prenatal care, maternal smoking during pregnancy,
low birth weight, infant mortality, child abuse, and develop-
mental delay. In a report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM;
Brown and Eisenberg 1995), the authors conclude that “the
consequences of unintended pregnancy are serious, imposing
appreciable burdens on children, women, men and families”
(p. 1). Policies directed at reducing unintended pregnancy
would reduce the risk of adverse outcomes for infants and
children. Therefore the committee on unintended pregnancy
“urges, first and foremost, that the nation adopt a new social
norm: All pregnancies should be intended” (p. 3). To this end,
it recommends “a multifaceted, long-term campaign to (1)
educate the public about the major social and public health
burdens of unintended pregnancy and (2) stimulate a compre-
hensive set of activities at national, state, and local levels to
reduce such pregnancies” (p. 4).
The association between unintended pregnancy and ad-
verse infant and child health outcomes provides an impor-
tant justification for the IOM recommendation. Although the
primary recommendation of the IOM report is to reduce un-

find only weak or mixed evidence of adverse effects on in-
fant health.
Few studies, however, control adequately for potentially
confounding effects of personal and family background char-
acteristics. Several studies present only simple cross-
tabulations of pregnancy intention and the outcomes of in-
terest. Others include only a limited set of covariates and
make no effort to control for unmeasured characteristics.
A second limitation is the use of outcomes such as pa-
rental behaviors that depend on recognition of pregnancy.
Women who intended to become pregnant are likely to rec-
ognize the pregnancy earlier than women who did not in-
tend to become pregnant.1 Differences in pregnancy recog-
nition alone could explain differences in delay of prenatal
care by pregnancy intention. Therefore late initiation of pre-
natal care and other risk-increasing maternal behaviors
(e.g., smoking) that depend on pregnancy recognition do
not necessarily reflect mistreatment of the fetus or the child.
Women who become pregnant unintentionally may engage
in risky behaviors before recognizing conception; once
aware of the pregnancy, however, they may cease or even
compensate for past behaviors.
Three recent U.S. studies examined effects of pregnancy
intention on outcomes beyond birth: Two focused on mater-
nal behaviors, and the other on child development. Marsiglio
and Mott (1988) examined the effect of unintended preg-
nancy on well-baby care and breast feeding. They used a
sample from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
(NLSY) (1979–1986) of women aged 19 to 27 who had only
one child. These authors found no effects of unintended preg-
nancy on well-baby care or breast feeding in models that in-
cluded a limited set of controls for socioeconomic back-
ground. They did not differentiate between mistimed and un-
wanted pregnancies, although other studies find this distinc-
tion to be important.
Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1993) examined use of well-
baby care and maternal employment after birth for women
aged 21 to 29 in the NLSY (1979–1986). They developed a
dynamic model of child quality production, with special at-
tention to the effect of child endowments on postpartum
maternal behaviors. In cross-sectional analyses they found
that unintended infants (unwanted or mistimed) were more
likely than wanted infants to receive well-baby care, hold-
ing constant the child’s endowment. Yet when the authors
estimated a mother fixed-effects model (i.e., differences be-
tween siblings), the results were reversed: Infants from un-
intended pregnancies were no more likely to receive well-
baby care, and mothers of unintended births were more
likely to work. The within-mother estimates must be inter-
preted cautiously, however, because the sample size was
only 62 in the case of well-baby care, and 186 in the case of
maternal employment. Furthermore, if an unwanted birth af-
fects siblings, estimates obtained by using sibling differ-
ences may be biased downward.
The only study of unintended pregnancy and child out-
comes in the United States was conducted by Baydar
(1995); she examined several developmental outcomes and
developmental resources, including aspects of the home en-
vironment and parenting behaviors thought to stimulate de-
velopment in young children. Baydar studied children less
than two years old in 1986, taken from the NLSY. In simple
tabulations, three of 10 developmental outcomes were asso-
ciated with mistimed or unwanted pregnancy. In multivari-
ate analyses, however, pregnancy intention was unrelated to
measures of child development. Baydar did find that the
availability of developmental resources was associated with
cognitive development, and concluded that developmental
resources mediated effects of pregnancy intention on cogni-
tive development. This conclusion may be unwarranted,
however, because all but one of the statistically significant
bivariate correlations between pregnancy intention and de-
velopment resources is eliminated by controls for family
background.
A Finnish study analyzed the educational attainment of
children born in 1966, whose pregnancies had been charac-
terized as accepted, mistimed, or unwanted (Myhrman et al.
1995). Those who were born as a result of an unwanted
pregnancy were more likely never to attend school beyond
(the compulsory) grade 9. This difference remained after
adjustment for mother’s education, mother’s age, single-
parent family structure, social class, family size, and mater-
nal employment. Mistimed births were not associated with
reduced education after adjustment for family background
characteristics.
Several other European studies examined effects of de-
nied abortion on child development (Cameron and Titchenor
1976; David et al. 1977; Forssman and Thuwe 1988; Hook
1975). A widely cited study assessed children resulting from
births to women in Prague, Czechoslovakia who were twice
denied abortion. Evidence of adverse outcomes associated
with these pregnancies has been mixed: When children from
unwanted pregnancies (UP) were compared with matched
controls from accepted or wanted pregnancies (AP), there
was no evidence of adverse health outcomes in infancy or
early childhood. Cognitive development also was unaffected
(e.g., there were no differences in IQ scores). The research-
ers, however, found evidence of a lower rate of language ac-
quisition, as well as impaired socioemotional development.
By age 9, stronger evidence of socioemotional problems and
maladjustment emerged, especially among UP boys (see
summaries in David 1981). Later studies of this cohort sug-
gested that differences between UP and AP children persisted
and increased with age.
In a follow-up analysis of the Prague cohort, UP and AP
subjects were compared at age 30 (Kubicka et al. 1995). The
authors found that UP subjects continued to experience less
successful psychosocial adaptation than their AP counter-
parts. UP females also were more likely to be unemployed.
Overall, effects associated with an unwanted pregnancy per-
1. Indeed, Kost, Forrest, and Singh (undated) show that 43% of women
whose pregnancies were unwanted did not recognize conception until at
least seven weeks, as compared with 26.5% of women with intended preg-
nancies.

the variation in births. We define an unwanted birth as a birth
above the expected number of births.
One of the key features of this simple model of fertility
is that the number of unintended births may depend on the
number of expected births. Michael and Willis (1975), for
example, constructed a model in which the variance of births
increases with the mean. Thus uncertainty and the number of
unintended births increase with the mean. As a result, factors
such as income that affect the mean number of births also
affect the variance of births and the number of births from
unintended pregnancies. It is necessary to control for these
factors in empirical analyses because they also affect child
outcomes (in ways other than through the pregnancy inten-
tion). In regard to schooling, for example, more highly edu-
cated parents may desire smaller families because they face
a higher opportunity cost of children; they also may practice
contraception more efficiently and thus may experience
fewer unintended births. Therefore parents’ schooling also
affects child well-being and thus is confounded with preg-
nancy intention. Bias may be present in estimates of the ef-
fect of pregnancy intention obtained from analyses that ig-
nore the influence of unmeasured factors such as family
background. Controlling for these factors is a central focus
of our research.
The simple behavioral model also suggests that an unin-
tended birth will affect maternal investments and child de-
velopment. An unwanted birth increases family size, and an
increase in family size raises the price of “child quality” be-
cause more resources are needed to produce a given level of
child quality (Becker and Lewis 1973). Thus an unwanted
birth raises the price of child quality and lowers average
child quality. In this case, the resources allocated to each
child are diminished. Therefore the model also suggests that
children who were intended may also be affected adversely
by an unintended birth; we return to this point below. In ad-
dition, the resources allocated specifically to the unwanted
child could decrease disproportionately. This would be the
case if the cost of adjustment to the unwanted birth falls most
heavily on the unwanted child.
A second way in which pregnancy intention may affect
child quality is through changes in parents’ concern for chil-
dren. Parents may resent an unwanted or mistimed child for
the burden it imposes on the family, and may treat him ad-
versely. Consequently an unwanted child will receive less
nurturing and resources than a wanted child, and will experi-
ence less favorable outcomes than his siblings. Studies of
European women denied abortion have emphasized this
mechanism to explain adverse social development associated
with unwanted pregnancy (David et al. 1988). Unintended
pregnancies may be associated with use of fewer healthy in-
puts such as prenatal care because of delay in recognizing
the conception, or because of denial that it occurred (Weller
et al. 1987). Finally, wantedness may reflect differences in
the prices of fertility control; therefore it may serve as a
proxy for these prices, which economic theory suggests af-
fect child quality and investments in child quality (Rosen-
zweig and Wolpin 1993).
sisted, but appeared to diminish with age, in contrast to ear-
lier findings. Yet when UP and AP subjects were matched to
their AP siblings, deficits for UP males were reduced and
were no longer statistically significant; differences in emo-
tional stability persisted among UP females, however. The
authors conclude:
[A] causal interpretation of these differences, if
siblings of UPs are not considered, may not be justi-
fiable because the familial background of UPs and
controls differs most likely in more respects than is
[sic] the unwantedness of pregnancy in one group.
Matching on demographic and related variables can-
not exclude possible differences in familial back-
ground (genetic and environmental) additional to un-
wanted pregnancy. (Kubicka et al. 1995:368)
Two conclusions emerge from our review of the litera-
ture. First, relatively few U.S. studies have examined the
association between pregnancy intention and adverse health
and developmental consequences for children beyond in-
fancy. Most of the previous studies focused on the relation-
ship between pregnancy intention and prenatal behaviors
and birth outcomes. We analyze the association between
pregnancy intention, parental behaviors, and child outcomes
from the prenatal period through early adolescence. This
more comprehensive approach allows us to test whether the
adverse effects of pregnancy intention found for prenatal
behaviors—the most consistently reported association
among studies based on U.S. survey data—persist into
childhood.
Second, many past analyses did not control adequately
for factors that may confound estimates of the effect of preg-
nancy intention on child development. A review of the lit-
erature, however, suggests that the association between un-
intended pregnancy and child development is sensitive to
controls for maternal characteristics and family background.
We address this shortcoming in two ways: (1) We include in
our regressions an extensive set of control variables that
measure maternal attributes and family characteristics, and
(2) we exploit differences between siblings to adjust for un-
measured influences.
ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK
In our empirical analysis, we rely on a simple behavioral
model of fertility to establish a definition of an unintended
pregnancy and to link pregnancy intention to maternal be-
havior and child development. Our definition of unintended
birth is similar to that presented by Michael and Willis
(1975). We begin by noting that fertility choices are con-
strained by costly and imperfect methods of fertility control.
Thus a woman will choose an efficient fertility control strat-
egy to yield an optimal expected number of children. Yet be-
cause of the uncertainty of fertility control, the actual num-
ber of births may be greater or smaller than the optimal ex-
pected number. Moreover, the greater the degree of uncer-
tainty (or the cost of reducing uncertainty), the larger will be

measured characteristics may be insufficient to control for
differences in family socioeconomic background between
women who have teen births and those who have births at
later ages (Geronimus and Korenman 1993; Geronimus,
Korenman, and Hillemeier 1994; Hoffman, Foster, and
Furstenberg 1993; Hotz, McElroy, and Sanders 1995). Fur-
thermore, Kubicka et al. (1995) demonstrate that estimated
effects of unintended births resulting from denied abortions
are sensitive to the use of sibling controls. To address this
problem, we estimate mother (between-sibling) fixed-effects
models using a sample of women with at least two children.
Fixed-effects models allow us to compare outcomes among
intended and unintended births across children in the same
family (i.e., “within mother”). This procedure controls for
unmeasured time-invariant maternal characteristics that af-
fect outcomes.
Two points related to the fixed-effects model merit fur-
ther discussion. First, fixed-effects models rely on a sub-
sample of families with multiple births. Therefore we check
that cross-section estimates for this subsample are similar to
those for the overall sample to ensure that any differences in
results between cross-section and fixed-effects analyses are
due to different statistical procedures rather than different
samples. Second, if unintended births affect the entire fam-
ily (as they would if they reduced resources available to all
children), then within-mother differences may understate the
effect of unintended births.
Therefore, as an alternative to sibling comparisons, we
also estimate models that use only between-family variation
to identify effects of unintended pregnancy on maternal and
child outcomes. Specifically, we regress average outcomes
for all siblings in a family on the proportion of children from
unintended pregnancies. These estimates measure the total
effect of an unintended child on all children in the family,
but do not control for unmeasured maternal characteristics.
By contrast, estimates obtained from sibling differences mea-
sure the impact on the unwanted sibling above and beyond
the impact on all children in the family.
We estimate all models with dichotomous outcomes by
logistic regression; we estimate models with continuous out-
comes by ordinary least squares (OLS). In all cases we ad-
just standard errors for clustering within families on the ba-
sis of Huber (1967), using algorithms contained in the soft-
ware Stata (StataCorp 1997). For within-mother estimates of
dichotomous outcomes, we use Chamberlin’s (1980) condi-
tional logit model.
DATA: THE NATIONAL LONGITUDINAL SURVEY
OF YOUTH
Data for this study come from the youth cohort of the Na-
tional Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experiences
(NLSY). The NLSY is a national probability sample of
young adults who were between ages 14 and 21 in 1979, the
first year of the survey (Center for Human Resources 1994).
The respondents have been interviewed yearly since that
time. The sample originally comprised 12,686 youths, ap-
proximately half of whom are women. The retention rate for
To this point we have defined an unintended birth with
reference to the optimal number of children, or in terms of a
“numbers failure,” but an unintended birth also may refer to
the timing of births. Births may be mistimed in that they
come sooner or later than preferred because of the uncer-
tainty of fertility control. We follow the literature, and re-
gard as mistimed only those births that occur sooner than
desired. The timing of parental investments in child quality
is important because parents may want to invest in child
quality when the cost of doing so is relatively small. For
example, a woman may want to spend time raising children
when she is young if the opportunity cost of her time is rela-
tively low. Alternatively, a woman may want to delay child-
bearing until she has invested in her own human capital.

where k is child’s age, i an index of children, t an index of
time, and j an index of characteristics. Let Xijt be exogenous
measures of family background and parental characteristics,
let Zijt be possibly endogenous measures of parental charac-
teristics, let UNWANTi represent pregnancy intention, and let
i capture unobserved, time-invariant characteristics associ-
ated with child well-being. The summation of Xijt and Zijt over
time in Eq. (1) indicates that we allow the cumulative effect
of factors such as income and AFDC participation to affect
child outcomes at time t. Finally, let , , , 	, 
,  and  be
parameters, and it the error term.
As we describe below, the NLSY collected extensive in-
formation that can be used to control for family background
and parental characteristics. Some controls for parental back-
ground and capabilities, however, are endogenous (Zijt in Eqs.
(1) and (2)). Parental choices with respect to education, mari-
tal status, family income, and labor force participation, for
instance, may be influenced by child outcomes. Therefore
our empirical strategy is to present estimates from two speci-
fications. The first includes variables that we consider to be
exogenous (Xijt in Eqs. (1) and (2)). The second specification
adds controls that are possibly endogenous. We present both
sets of results because there may be a tradeoff between
endogeneity bias and omitted variable bias.
A related statistical problem with the estimation of the
parameters in Eqs. (1) and (2) is the presence of unmeasured
factors ( in Eqs. (1) and (2)) that affect child development
and maternal behaviors. We have noted the demographic and
socioeconomic background differences between women who
have unintended (especially unwanted) births and those who
do not. Recent research in adolescent fertility suggests that

the survey has been extremely high; as of 1993, it was 91%
of the eligible population.2
In addition to the large female sample, the NLSY has
obtained information for 9,360 children born to 4,415 sample
mothers by 1992. The use of more recent years of the NLSY
survey produces a sample of births that is more representa-
tive of all births to this cohort of women in the U.S. popula-
tion than were the samples used in past research. Specifi-
cally, we can include six more years of data than did
Marsiglio and Mott (1988), Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1993),
and Baydar (1995). We limit the sample to children born af-
ter 1978 because family characteristics are not available be-
fore 1979, the first year of the NLSY survey.3
Two features of the NLSY make it particularly suited to
our research objectives: the longitudinal design and the as-
sessment of multiple children born to mothers in the sample.
The longitudinal nature of the data allows us to relate infor-
mation about pregnancy intention collected during pregnancy
or shortly after birth to child outcomes measured at various
ages beginning at birth and continuing through age 11.4 The
availability of health and developmental outcomes for sib-
lings allows us to control for unmeasured characteristics
common to siblings who may differ in their “intendedness”
status. Of the 4,415 mothers in the NLSY, 3,038 have had at
least two births; 61% of these families contained at least one
unintended and one intended child.
Questions on Pregnancy Intention
The questions on pregnancy intention in the NLSY closely
parallel those in the National Survey of Family Growth.
Women are asked a series of four questions about pregnancy
intention for each pregnancy. In 29% of the cases, intention
questions were asked during pregnancy (ex ante; that is, be-
fore the birth). For the remaining pregnancies, the responses
were obtained ex post: in most cases within one year of the
child’s birth. Pregnancy intention could be determined for
89% of births.5 Among births classified, the breakdown of
pregnancy intention is as follows: 60% wanted, 30% mis-
timed, and 10% unwanted. In contrast to much previous re-
search, we differentiate between unwanted and mistimed
births in our empirical analysis.
Researchers have questioned the validity of information
about pregnancy intention (Klerman and Jekel 1984; Miller
1974; Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1993; Westoff and Ryder
1977). Westoff and Ryder, for example, suggested that moth-
ers (or parents) may engage in “ex post rationalization”: Af-
ter a child is born, they may disproportionately report the
pregnancy as intended. Klerman and Jekel (1984) argued that
responses to questions about pregnancy intention depend on
the circumstances in which the information is obtained, in-
cluding, for example, the interviewer’s race and sex. In con-
trast, Schoen et al. (1999) showed that fertility intention (i.e.,
wantedeness) predicts fertility accurately and is the most im-
portant predictor of fertility beside marital status. The up-
shot is that pregnancy intention may be measured with some
error; thus estimates of its effect on infant and child devel-
opment may be biased.
Outcomes
The NLSY contains measures of infant health, child cogni-
tive development, child social development, and maternal
behaviors related to infant health. In 1986, 1988, 1990, and
1992 a battery of child assessments was administered to all
children born to female respondents by those dates. From
these assessments we have chosen three measures of cogni-
tive development and one measure of social development.
The cognitive assessments are (raw) scores on the
Peabody Individual Achievement Tests (PIATs) of reading
and math, and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-
R). The PIAT reading recognition test measures primarily
word recognition. The PIAT math test measures the child’s
attainment in mathematics as taught in mainstream educa-
tion. The PIAT test instruments are the same for all children;
thus the raw score on the test increases as the child grows
older and can answer more of the questions correctly. For
example, the math test consists of 84 multiple-choice ques-
tions beginning with recognizing numerals and progressing
to trigonometry (Baker et al. 1993). The PIAT is a widely
used assessment of cognitive ability and academic achieve-
ment, and is a reliable and valid measure of various aspects
of child cognitive development.6 The PPVT-R is a measure of
receptive vocabulary for Standard American English. Chil-
dren may have taken these tests on more than one occasion,
so we selected the first test score for each child. We also rees-
timated all models using the last test score; the results were
qualitatively similar to those reported below for the first test.7
To measure social development we use the raw score on
the Behavior Problems Index (BPI), which measures mater-
6. See Baker et al. (1993) for a complete description of the cognitive
tests administered to the children in the NLSY.
7. Our results were hardly affected by whether we used outcomes from
the first or the last time the child was assessed, because the age ranges for
each test are very narrow. For example, approximately 95% of the children
in our sample took the math and reading tests between ages 5 and 7. In
addition, we include individual-year dummy variables for each child age.
2. The eligible population includes those respondents who were not
intentionally dropped from the sample. In 1985 the NLSY dropped a
subsample of military participants; in 1991 it dropped a subsample of disad-
vantaged white youths. See the NLS Handbook (Center for Human Re-
sources 1994).
3. As of 1992 only 10% of all children of NLSY mothers were born
before 1979.
4. Questions on pregnancy intention were first asked in 1982. Thus,
for children born between 1979 and 1981, assessment of pregnancy inten-
tion may have been obtained as long as three years after the birth. As an
adjustment, we control for year of birth in model B in Table 2, and control
for child’s age and year of assessment in all models in Table 3.
5. We independently developed an algorithm for linking questions on
pregnancy intentions in the NLSY to child outcomes. We then cross-checked
our assignment of pregnancy intentions with two other independent assign-
ments: one by Baydar (1995) and the other by Rosenzweig and Wolpin
(1993). Agreement between the three assignments was over 90%. For cases
that we could not assign, we used the assignment of Baydar (1995) if avail-
able. We were unable to link specific child outcomes to pregnancy intention
questions for approximately 11% of the children in the sample. For these
cases, we created a dummy variable indicating that their status could not be
determined.

nal reports of problem behaviors. The BPI has been collected
in several national surveys and has proved a reliable predic-
tor of socioemotional development (Baker et al. 1993). As in
the cognitive tests, we chose the first BPI assessment for
each child. Note that the BPI is scaled so that higher scores
indicate more behavior problems (see Table 1).
We use a dichotomous indicator of low birth weight (less
than 5.5 pounds) as a measure of infant health. Although the
NLSY information on birth weight is based on maternal re-
ports, comparisons of birth weight reports from the NLSY
and from vital records showed high rates of agreement
(Baker et al. 1993).
The NLSY contains several measures of maternal behav-
iors and resource utilization that not only may affect child
development but also may be correlated with pregnancy in-
tention. Several measures are related to birth outcomes, in-
cluding prenatal care, cigarette smoking, and alcohol con-
sumption during pregnancy. For the neonatal period, the
NLSY contains information on infant-feeding practices.
The NLSY also contains an extremely rich set of con-
trols. It offers extensive longitudinal information about the
mother, including her family background, education and la-
bor market experiences, income, marital history, cognitive
ability and achievement (i.e., Armed Services Vocational
Aptitude Battery), and psychological indices (e.g., Rotter
Scale of Self-Efficacy). The longitudinal data allow us to
construct several summary measures of maternal and family
characteristics during the child’s lifetime, such as average
family income.
RESULTS
Descriptive Analysis
Table 1 presents sample means for outcomes by pregnancy
intention. We calculate these figures using NLSY sampling
weights.
We find substantial differences in outcomes by preg-
nancy intention. Outcomes were worst for children whose
mother reported their pregnancy to be unwanted: Unwanted
children received less prenatal care, were more likely to have
mothers who were heavy smokers during pregnancy, were
less likely to be breast-fed, and had higher rates of low birth
weight than did children who were intended. Infants whose
mothers reported that the pregnancy was mistimed, or infants

PREGNANCY INTENTION AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT

for whom pregnancy intention could not be determined,
showed better outcomes than unwanted infants but worse
than those who were intended. We observe a similar pattern
for child outcomes, although the differences are less pro-
nounced than for infant outcomes except for the Peabody
Picture Vocabulary Test.
Table 1 provides preliminary evidence that unintended
pregnancy harms infant and child development. As noted
previously, however, unintended pregnancy is also associated
with other factors that may affect infant and child develop-
ment. Indeed, this point is confirmed by a comparison of
means (not shown) for other sociodemographic characteris-
tics of the mother by pregnancy intention: Mothers who char-
acterize the pregnancy as unwanted are more likely to have
never married, to be black, to have lower family income, to
have completed less schooling, and to have scored lower on
the Armed Forces Qualifications Test (a test of academic
ability and achievement). The observed association between
social and economic disadvantage and unwanted pregnancy
provides an alternative explanation for the adverse infant and
child outcomes associated with unwanted pregnancy in Table
1. To investigate these competing explanations, we turn to
the multivariate analysis.
Regression Estimates
Tables 2 and 3 summarize results of regression analyses for
eight different outcomes related to infant and child develop-
ment. Table 2 presents results related to maternal behaviors
associated with infant health and birth weight; Table 3 pre-
sents the results related to child development. As noted, a
child may be assessed in more than one year for a particular
outcome (e.g., PIAT tests); therefore we select the outcome
corresponding to the first time the child was assessed (see
note 6).
We present estimates from three sets of regressions. Es-
timates in columns 1 and 2 are based on the complete cross-
section of pregnancies and/or children; estimates in columns
3 and 4 are based on sibling differences (mother fixed ef-
fects); estimates in columns 5 and 6 are based on between-
family differences, where the unit of observation is the fam-
ily and where observations are averages taken across all chil-
dren present in the family.
For each sample, we estimate two models. Model A
contains a limited set of exogenous variables such as region
of residence, child’s sex, mother’s race and ethnicity, and
measures of the mother’s family background (e.g., family
structure at age 14). Model B includes, in addition to the
controls contained in model A, a variety of sociodemo-
graphic variables that are less plausibly exogenous, such as
the child’s birth order, the mother’s age at birth, family
AFDC status, mother’s education, mother’s labor force sta-
tus, and family income. (The complete list of variables ap-
pears in the footnotes to Tables 2 and 3.) Characteristics
such as the mother’s race and ethnicity and the mother’s
family structure at age 14 do not vary by sibling; therefore
these variables are omitted from the model when regres-
sions include mother fixed effects.
One additional point pertains to the timing of measure-
ment. In the analyses related to infants, most mother and
family characteristics are measured at the first survey after
the birth of the child. In the analyses of child outcomes,
mother and family characteristics are measured either at the
time of the child assessment (e.g., mother’s education) or as
an average over the child’s life (e.g., family income; see Eq.
(1)). Lifetime averages are intended to capture cumulative
processes in development. For example, contemporaneous
measures of family characteristics such as income may be
noisy measures of the conditions that prevailed during most
of a child’s life (Duncan and Brooks-Gunn 1997).
Maternal behaviors and infant health. Cross-sectional
estimates from model A provide the most consistent evi-
dence of a direct relationship between unwanted and (to a
lesser extent) mistimed pregnancy and adverse maternal be-
haviors and infant health. For each maternal behavior, the
coefficient associated with an unwanted pregnancy is gener-
ally twice as large as the coefficient on mistimed pregnancy.
In the case of very late prenatal care, for instance, women
whose pregnancies are unwanted are 2.8 percentage points
more likely to initiate care after the sixth month of preg-
nancy than are women whose pregnancies are intended.
This effect is relatively large, given that approximately 6%
of women in our sample begin prenatal care after the sixth
month. We find substantially smaller differences in timing
of prenatal care between women whose pregnancies are in-
tended and women with mistimed pregnancies: only 1.5 per-
centage points. In the case low birth weight, the coefficients
on mistimed and on unwanted pregnancy differ in sign and
statistical significance.
Estimates obtained from model B provide less evidence
that unintended pregnancy is associated with adverse behav-
iors and health outcomes. For example, the coefficients of
unwanted pregnancy are smaller (by about 50% on average)
than in model A and are statistically significant for prenatal
care timing, heavy smoking, and breast feeding (column 1).
In the case of mistimed pregnancy, adding covariates to
model A eliminates all but one statistically significant asso-
ciation between mistimed pregnancy and maternal behaviors
and infant health (column 2). The most important of the ad-
ditional variables, in terms of their influence on the effect of
pregnancy intentions, are mother’s age at birth, mother’s
marital status, mother’s education (particularly in the smok-
ing model), and year of birth.
Estimates obtained from sibling differences (mother
fixed effects) are presented in columns 3 and 4; the between-
family estimates are shown in columns 5 and 6. Coefficients
of both unwanted and mistimed pregnancy in model A with
mothers’ fixed effects are smaller, in most cases, than the
corresponding cross-sectional estimates. In regard to heavy
smoking, for example, the cross-sectional estimates indicate
that the proportion of heavy smokers among mothers with
unwanted pregnancies is 5.9 percentage points greater than
among mothers with intended pregnancies (p < .01). The dif-
ference for mistimed pregnancies is 2.7 percentage points
(p < .05). When we compare this result with estimates that

90

include for mother fixed effects, we find that estimates of
the effect of unwanted and mistimed pregnancy on smoking
are smaller and statistically insignificant. This pattern is also
evident in the results for low birth weight.
In contrast, fixed-effects estimates from model A associ-
ated with prenatal care timing and breast feeding are approxi-
mately of the same magnitude as the corresponding cross-
section estimates. When additional covariates are added to

the fixed-effects models (i.e., model B), the estimates asso-
ciated with smoking and low birth weight become even
smaller, but those associated with prenatal care timing and
breast feeding are hardly affected.
One interpretation of the mother fixed-effects procedure
is that it is an effective control for unobserved heterogeneity.
In particular, the results associated with heavy smoking and
low birth weight suggest that unmeasured family background
characteristics rather than pregnancy intention account for
the adverse behaviors associated with unintended pregnan-
cies. An alternative interpretation is that the within-mother
estimates (sibling differences) are biased downward because
of effects that “spill over” from a mother’s unintended preg-
nancies to her intended pregnancies. The “spillover” argu-
ment is also supported by the model A estimates from the
between-family analysis, which also tend to be larger than
model A fixed-effects estimates.
Other estimates in Table 2, however, support the inter-
pretation that pregnancy intention is confounded by family
background. First, the coefficients in models A and B for the

within-mother sample are similar (columns 2 and 3); this
finding suggests that the addition of mother fixed effects in
the more parsimonious specification (model A) is an effec-
tive control for the characteristics introduced as controls in
model B. Second, the coefficients for model B obtained from
the cross-sectional and between-family approaches are simi-
lar to estimates obtained with mother fixed effects, although
the between-family estimates are significantly smaller in the
case of prenatal care timing and breast feeding. In other
words, we apparently eliminate the confounding effect of
family background either by including mother fixed effects
or by including a detailed set of observed characteristics. An
advantage of the mother fixed-effects specification, however,
is that these specifications do not include potentially endog-
enous covariates.
In sum, we find relatively weak support for the hypoth-
esis that unintended pregnancy is associated with adverse
maternal behaviors and poor infant health, adjusted for fam-
ily background. Some evidence suggests that unwanted preg-
nancy is associated with very late prenatal care, heavy smok-
ing, and reduced breast feeding (column 1), but these find-
ings are not robust. We next examine the relationship be-
tween child cognitive and behavioral development and preg-
nancy intention.
Child cognitive development. Table 3 summarizes results
of regression models in which the dependent variable is one
of four measures of cognitive or socioemotional develop-
ment: the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-R), the
PIAT math test, the PIAT reading recognition test, and the
Behavior Problems Index (BPI). We multiply the BPI by –1
so that higher indices reflect better development, as in the
other cognitive outcomes.
Nearly all the estimates in Tables 3 suggest that preg-
nancy intention has little effect on children’s cognitive de-
velopment. In the case of mistimed pregnancies, few esti-
mates in Table 3 are statistically significant. This result is
similar to our previous findings for maternal behaviors and
infant health. Thus the results shown in Tables 2 and 3 sug-
gest that mistimed pregnancies are not significantly associ-
ated with adverse consequences for infants and children. This
finding has been obscured in past studies that treated all un-
intended pregnancies equally.
Cross-sectional estimates in model A indicate that chil-
dren resulting from unwanted pregnancies register lower
reading scores, have less highly developed vocabularies, and
suffer greater behavioral problems than do children from in-
tended pregnancies. Yet once we control for family and en-
vironmental factors (observed or unobserved), estimates of
the effect of unwanted pregnancy on children’s cognitive de-
velopment are small and not statistically significant. Except
for the BPI, estimates based on sibling differences (mother
fixed effects) in model A are similar to those based on be-
tween-family variation from model B (columns 3 and 5). As
before, inclusion of mother fixed effects appears to be an ef-
fective method to eliminate confounding from family back-
ground. The advantage of sibling differences (mother fixed
effects) is that we can control for family background without
the need to include potentially endogenous covariates, al-
though estimates obtained through sibling differences may
be biased because of “spillover” effects.
Additional Analyses (Not Shown)
To investigate whether differences between the cross-section
and the mother fixed-effects estimates in Tables 2 and 3 could
be due to differences in the samples rather than in the method,
we reestimated the cross-sectional models but limited the
sample to families with at least two children. The estimates
differed inconsequentially from the full cross-section.
We argued that the between-family estimates (columns
5 and 6) were less subject to “spillover” bias than were
within-family estimates. A limitation of these estimates,
however, is the potential confounding from unobserved fam-
ily background. We interpret the agreement among estimates
in Table 2 and 3, especially in model B, as evidence that such
confounding is not likely. Nevertheless, we estimated effects
based on differences among first cousins: that is, differences
among children whose mothers are sisters (family fixed ef-
fects). These estimates also would be less likely to be af-
fected by “spillover” bias, but would control more effectively
for unmeasured background characteristics than would the
between-family estimates. Estimates from these models were
uninformative: measured imprecisely, unstable across speci-
fications, and often counterintuitive (results are available on
request). Moreover, cross-sectional estimates obtained from
this sample of sisters and their children were dissimilar to
estimates from the full cross-section.
DISCUSSION
As noted in our introduction, the report by the Institute of
Medicine concluded that an unintended child “is at greater
risk of being born at low birth weight, of dying in its first
year of life, of being abused, and of not receiving sufficient
resources for healthy development” (Brown and Eisenberg
1995:1). We analyzed the association between unintended
childbearing and child health and cognitive development,
controlling for family background and parental characteris-
tics. We found some evidence that unwanted pregnancy is
associated with less healthy prenatal and postpartum behav-
iors, but that it has little association with birth weight or
child cognitive outcomes. In some models, women whose
pregnancies were unwanted were more likely to delay prena-
tal care and to smoke during pregnancy than women whose
pregnancies were wanted, and were less likely to breast-feed.
We found no relationship, however, between pregnancy in-
tention and birth weight. One explanation is that the differ-
ences in smoking and use of prenatal care by pregnancy in-
tention may be too small to permit detection of their effect
on low birth weight, given our sample sizes.
Although we found little association between preg-
nancy intention and our measures of child social and cogni-
tive development, the effects of other variables in these
models, such as family income, mother’s education and
cognitive ability, and family structure, were usually signifi-
cant. Thus the absence of a significant effect of pregnancy

PREGNANCY INTENTION AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT

intentions is not a consequence of poorly measured out-
comes. The disadvantage of including this extensive set of
family background measures is that many of these vari-
ables—family size, marital status, AFDC participation, and
labor supply, for instance—are potentially endogenous or
could be mechanisms through which unintended pregnancy
affects child outcomes. If this is so, it may be inappropriate
to control for these variables in assessing the effect of unin-
tended pregnancy. Yet in models that include few controls
but adjust for family background by including mother fixed
effects, we also found little evidence for an effect of unin-
tended pregnancy on child development.
In sum, our findings challenge the notion that unwanted
pregnancy harms infant health and child development as
measured in our data. Our results suggest that the robust as-
sociations between pregnancy intention and infant health re-
ported in the literature are confounded by unmeasured fam-
ily background variables. Policies that reduce births result-
ing from unintended pregnancies may have only a limited
effect on the health and development of a particular woman’s
children. In contrast, policies that reduce the social and en-
vironmental deficits into which unwanted children are born,
or directly target adverse infant health and child develop-
ment, hold greater promise for improving these outcomes.
Such a policy prescription, however, should rest on a thor-
ough examination of the costs and effectiveness of various
intervention strategies.
