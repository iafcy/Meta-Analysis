Abstract Background Postpartum depression is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes for
both the mother and infant. This study examines the relationship between a mother and/or her partner’s pregnancy
intentions and reported post-partum depressive symptoms
(PPDs). Methods Using Louisiana pregnancy risk assessment monitoring system, 2000–2003, a secondary crosssectional analysis was conducted on 5549 mothers, stratified by race, who delivered a singleton, live birth and
whose infant was still alive at the time of the survey.
Bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted, taking into account the complex survey design.
Results In multivariable models, unwanted pregnancies
were associated with severe PPDs (aOR 1.76, 95 % CI
1.23–2.53). Furthermore, the association between husbands/partners’ who did not want or care about the pregnancy and mild PPDs remained for White women (aOR
1.32, 95 % CI 1.02–1.69); while among Black women,
neither parent’s pregnancy intention were associated with

mild or severe PPDs. Conclusions This study supports
existing research demonstrating the association between
pregnancy intention and PPDs. This study contributes to
the limited information on the role that partner pregnancy
intention plays on maternal mental health outcomes,
however further discussion is needed on the impact of this
role across races. Findings can be used in programs aiming
to reduce adverse mental health outcomes among high-risk
mothers.

### Significance

Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are
unintended—either mistimed or unwanted. Though a limited number of studies have found that women with
unwanted or mistimed pregnancies were at higher risk of
reporting PPD, they have not consistently taken into consideration partner support, particularly father’s own pregnancy wantedness or intention. Furthermore, no studies to
date that have examined the impact of partner support
within racial groups.

The objective of this study was to better understand the
relationship between pregnancy intentions of both the
mother and the father and maternal postpartum depressive
affect, utilizing data from the state-wide Louisiana Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (LaPRAMS)
Phase IV (2000–2003) data. This study contributes to the
limited information on the role that partner pregnancy
intention plays on postpartum depressive affect and presents novel findings by race that may aid in prevention
strategies.

### Background

Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended—eithermistimedorunwanted[1–3].Thetermmistimed
pregnancy is most commonly used when a women becomes
pregnant earlier than preferred and an unwanted pregnancy
when there wasn’t a desire for children at all, or more children

[3]. In fact, almost 40 % of women in the U.S. in their lifetime
have had an unintended pregnancy that led to an early termination [1], and 37 % of women have delivered a baby that
resulted from an unintended pregnancy [4]. In Louisiana alone,
58 % of all pregnancies are unintended—72 % of those are
mistimed, and 28 % are unwanted [5]. Younger (aged 18–24),
unmarried (particularly cohabiting), low-income, minority
women and women who have not completed high school are
more likely to have an unintended pregnancy [6].
Unintended pregnancies are associated with adverse
health outcomes for the mother and child, such as maternal
tobacco and alcohol use during pregnancy [7, 8], low birth
weight or preterm birth [8, 9], lower prenatal care utilization, reduced breast feeding rates [5, 8, 10, 11], lower folic
acid consumption or decreased use of prenatal care services

[12–15]. While the relationship between pregnancy intention and infant health outcomes has been well documented,
few studies address the impact of unintended pregnancies
on maternal physical and mental health, such as postpartum
depression (PPD) [16–24].
Nearly 20 % of mothers experience a depressive episode
within the first 3 months postpartum, and 7.1 % have major
depressive symptomology [25]. Symptoms of PPD are
depressed mood, sleep disturbance, weight changes, loss of
energy, decreased concentration, increased sensitivity and
anxiety [26]. PPD has been associated with a decrease in
the time a mother spends with her infant [27], missed
pediatric appointments [28], higher levels of disruptive
behavior among children [29], and insecure attachment
between mother and child [30]. Although there is no clear
cause of PPD, risk factors include family history of psychiatric disease, marital distress, inadequate social support,
intimate partner violence, racial or ethnic minority status,
and high levels of psychosocial stress [26, 31–33].
Reported symptoms of PPD have been lower among White
women in some samples [34, 34], and higher in others [35],
although once additional factors such as financial hardship
and pregnancy intention are taken into account, racial and
ethnic differences in PPD may no longer be apparent [35–
37]. Though a limited number of studies have found that
women with unwanted or mistimed pregnancies were at
higher risk of reporting PPD, they have not consistently
taken into consideration partner support [15, 17, 18, 38,
39], and we identified no studies to date that have examined the impact of partner support within racial groups.

## 1 3


Marital status or lack of a partner has been linked with an
increased risk of PPD [31, 35], and the connection between
relationship quality and or satisfaction and depression has
been well documented [40]. One potential mechanism in the
relation between marital status or lack of a partner and risk of
PPD is the effect of partner support on the mother’s perceived social support, which may be linked to PPD [35, 36].
While paternal support can be defined through multiple
measures: financial support, assistance with child-rearing,
the presence of the father on the baby’s birth certificate [41–
47], father’s own pregnancy wantedness or intention is
another aspect of social support related to maternal mental
health that has received much less attention in the literature.
While few studies have examined the increase in risk of PPD
as a result of partner pregnancy intention [16], research on
partners’ pregnancy intentions and relationship quality has
demonstrated the important role that relationship quality and
partner intentions play in prenatal care [48], smoking during
pregnancy [49], and subsequent high-risk pregnancies [50].
Others have linked partners’ pregnancy intentions and
relationship satisfaction to depression, although the risk of
PPD was not addressed explicitly [51, 52].
The objective of this study was to better understand the
relationship between pregnancy intentions of both the
mother and the father and maternal postpartum depressive
affect. We hypothesized that compared to mothers who
wanted their pregnancies, those who mistimed or did not
want to conceive, would have higher rates of reported
postpartum depressive affect, with stronger associations in
unwanted pregnancies than mistimed pregnancies. We also
hypothesized that mothers whose partners viewed the
pregnancy as mistimed or unwanted would have higher
rates of reported postpartum depressive affect than mothers
whose partners wanted the pregnancy.

### Methods

Study Design

A secondary cross-sectional study utilizing Louisiana’s
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System
(LaPRAMS) Phase IV (2000–2003) data was conducted.
Phase IV LaPRAMS data was used because it is more representative of the general Louisiana population since Phases
V and VI had low response rates due to the disruption and
displacement of residents caused by Hurricane Katrina. The
average response rate for 2000–2003 was 71 %.
PRAMS is an ongoing, population-based risk factor
surveillance system designed to detect maternal experiences and health behaviors that occur before, during and
after pregnancy [53]. Stratified random sampling of


-----

mothers is used to oversample older (35? years old)
mothers, women who deliver low birth weight (\2500 g)
infants and racial minorities. PRAMS questions cover
topics such as prenatal care, obstetric history, maternal use
of alcohol and cigarettes, physical abuse, contraception,
economic status, maternal stress, and early infant development and health status [54]. PRAMS utilizes both
qualitative and quantitative data in a self-reported questionnaire that is completed a few months after the baby is
born. An introduction letter is sent to introduce PRAMS to
the mother and within a week, the mother receives the
survey in the mail. Mothers who do not complete the first
survey are mailed a second; if they do not complete the
second survey, they are mailed a third. Mothers who do not
complete any of the three mail surveys are contacted by
telephone, for a total data collection period of 95 days. To
minimize recall bias, efforts to contact women end
9 months postpartum [54].
Approximately 100–300 women are selected per month
from a stratified sample of eligible birth certificates [54].
Consistent with previous and ongoing PRAMS procedure,
all participating health departments use a standardized data
collection method developed by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. In this study, three levels of inclusion criteria were applied. First analysis was limited to
mothers who delivered singleton live births and whose child
was still living at the time the survey was administered
(N = 6582). Next, only White and Black mothers were
included in the analysis due to very small sample size of
other racial groups in the dataset (\2 %). Last, analysis was
limited to women who had completed information on all of
analytic variables including outcomes, key exposure variables, demographic and other predictors (described below).
List-wise deletion was chosen because there were \10 %
missing data and no differences between missing and nonmissing so missing at random was assumed. For perceived
husband/partner pregnancy intention, \5 % of the mothers
were missing data and therefore were not included in this
analysis. After inclusion criterion was applied the final
analytic sample included 5549 women. There were no differences between the full and analytic samples with respect
to demographics or other potential confounders.

Measures

Exposure

Mother’s pregnancy intention from LaPRAMS was measured by a question addressing how they felt about
becoming pregnant, ‘‘Thinking back to just before you got
pregnant, how did you feel about becoming pregnant?’’
The answer scales included (1) ‘‘Wanted to be pregnant
sooner’’; (2) ‘‘Wanted to be pregnant later’’; (3) ‘‘Wanted


to be pregnant then’’; (4) ‘‘Did not want to be pregnant then
or in the future.’’ Consistent with previous studies [7, 55],
we collapsed this variable into three levels: wanted (options 1 and 3), mistimed (option 2) and unwanted pregnancy (option 4). The mother’s perception of her husband
or partner’s pregnancy intention was measured by the
question ‘‘Which statement describes your husband or
partner before pregnancy?’’ (1) ‘‘Wanted me to get pregnant’’, (2) ‘‘Partly wanted to get pregnant’’, (3) ‘‘He didn’t
care one way or the other’’, (4) ‘‘Did not especially want
me to get pregnant’’, (4) ‘‘Wanted very much for me not to
get pregnant.’’ Options 1 and 2 were classified as a wanted
pregnancy, option 3 as indifferent, and options 4 and 5 as
unwanted. We also examine partner discordance, defined
as: the mother wanting the pregnancy but the partner not
wanting the pregnancy; the mother not wanting the pregnancy but the partner wanting the pregnancy; any discordance between mother and partner (yes/no).

Outcome

Five options derived from LaPRAMs responses to the
question ‘‘In the months after your delivery, would you say
that you were…’’ were used as indicators to measure selfreported post-partum depressive symptoms (PPDs).
Respondents’ answers were classified into three categories:
‘‘Not depressed at all’’ was deemed as absence of depressive affect, ‘‘Little depressed’’ and ‘‘Moderately depressed’’ as mild depression; and ‘‘Very depressed’’ or ‘‘Very
depressed and need help’’ as severe depression.

Covariates

All of sociodemographic variables were obtained from
LaPRAMs IV and birth certificate records in Louisiana.
Maternal age and biological fathers’ age (from birth certificate) were re-coded as younger than 18, 18–24, 25–34,
older than 35 years old. Maternal education from the birth
certificate was categorized as \12, 12 and [12 years. The
household income (from PRAMS) was categorized as
$0–14,999, $15,000–24,999, $25,000–34,999, higher than
$35,000. Marital status (from birth certificate) was classified
as married and not married. Additional variables were
dichotomized as yes or no including: insurance (‘‘Insurance
status before delivery’’ and ‘‘Medicaid during pregnancy’’)
from PRAMS, birth outcomes from the birth certificate
(‘‘previous live birth’’ and ‘‘Very low birth weight baby’’ i.e.
babies born weighing \1500 g), and three health behavior
indicators from PRAMS (‘‘smoking at last 3 months during
pregnancy’’, ‘‘drinking at the last 3 months of pregnancy’’
and current smoking status. As a marker of stress, if participants gave any confirmative answer to 13 stress questions
on the PRAMS survey (e.g., homeless, lost job, financial

problems, and physical fight) they were characterized as
having experienced at least one stressor 12 months before
pregnancy. Factor weights were applied to individual stressors, however this did not result in a statistic difference
analytically, and treating stress as un-weighted by type of
stressor is commonly utilized in cumulative risk markers

[56, 57]. Physical abuse from PRAMS was measured by
asking whether new mothers had any physical abuse from
husband or others 12 months before or during their pregnancy, and their responses were dichotomized as yes and no.
These covariates were chose based on previous documentation in the literature of their association with pregnancy
intention and birth outcomes as well as examination of
potential confounding as described below.

Data Analysis

Descriptive analysis was performed to characterize the
respondents. To obtain the pairwise comparison, a generalized multinominal logistic regression model was used to
evaluate the associations between outcome variable (PPDs)
and exposure variables (Parents’ pregnancy intention) controlling for demographic and other covariate variables.
Bivariate analyses and Chi square test were performed to
estimate the crude association between maternal pregnancy
intention and husband/partners’ intention and PPDs separately and crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated. Covariates that were significantly associated with PPDs at p \ 0.05 in bivariate analyses and that changed the estimation of the ORs for intention
by more than 10 %, or commonly considered confounders in
the literature were included in a multinominal logistic
regression model to examine the association between exposure and mild PPDs and severe PPDs respectively. Mother
and husband/partner’s pregnancy intention were included in
the same model, however models with separate intention
variables as well as discordance were run separately. Due to
long-standing racial disparities (White vs. Black) in birth
outcomes [58], racial disparities in unintended pregnancies

[6], and conflicting evidence regarding PPD differences
across race among women, we tested effect modification by
race and data analysis was stratified by race to examine
whether there were racial differences in the association
between parents’ pregnancy intention and PPDs. To account
for the complex sampling design of PRAMS, all statistical
analyses were weighted and performed using SAS 9.2.

### Results

Weighted frequencies of demographic characteristics,
parents’ pregnancy intention and PPDs of all participants
are presented in Table 1. Of 5549 respondents, 60.7 %

## 1 3


were White and 39.3 % were Black mothers. For pregnancy intention among respondents, 47.3 % mothers
reported that they wanted to have a baby at that time, 36 %
that the pregnancy was mistimed and 16.7 % that the
pregnancy was unwanted. Nearly half of respondents
reported their husbands/partners’ wanted them to become
pregnant, 19 % didn’t care and 24 % did not want their
wives/partners’ to become pregnant. With respect to discordance, 14 % of mothers experienced some form of
partner discordance, with approximately 9 % of mothers
wanting the pregnancy but the partner did not and 5 % of
mothers not wanting the pregnancy but the partner did.
Nearly 60 % of women reported they experienced any type
of PPDs (9.2 % severe PPDs and 48.2 mild PPDs).
White mothers were more likely to report that their
pregnancy was intended compared to Black mothers. While
26 % of Black mothers reported their pregnancy was
unintended a much lower percentage of White participants
reported unintended pregnancies (11 %). Responses were
similar for Black and White women related to their husbands/partner’s pregnancy intention; more than 50 % of
husbands/partners wanted a baby and \30 % did not.
Overall, White mothers reported higher percentages of
mild PPDs than Black mothers (52 % vs. 42 %), and Black
mothers were more likely to report no PPDs and severe
PPDs compared to White mothers.
Crude bivariate analysis, presented in Table 2, in the
overall sample revealed that respondents whose pregnancies were mistimed were 15 % more likely to have mild
(OR 1.15, 95 % CI 1.01–1.33) and 50 % more likely to
have severe PPDs (OR 1.52, 95 % CI 1.19–1.95) compared
to mothers who wanted to become pregnant. The association was even stronger between unwanted pregnancies and
reporting severe PPDs; mothers who did not want to
become pregnant were twice as likely to report severe
PPDs compared to mothers who wanted to become pregnant (OR 2.12, 95 % CI 1.58–2.84). Maternal report of
partners’ pregnancy intention was also associated with
mothers’ PPDs. Respondents were 1.25 times more likely
to report mild (OR 1.25, 95 % CI 1.07–1.47) and 1.46
times more likely to report severe PPDs (severe PPDs OR
1.46, 95 % CI 1.12–1.89) if they perceived that their husbands/partners did not want the pregnancy.;). With respect
to discordance, mothers who wanted the pregnancy but the
partner did not were significantly less likely to report
severe PPDs (OR 0.64, 95 % CI 0.44–0.93); while those
who did not want the pregnancy but the partner did were
significantly more likely to report severe PPDs (OR 1.57,
95 % CI 1.04–2.37). As expected given these results, there
was no relation between any discordance and PPDs.
In the overall sample, crude associations were statistically significant for the following covariates—maternal
education ([12 years of education), household income

All of percentages were based on non-missing cases (N = 5549)


([$35,000), marital status (married) and having insurance
before becoming pregnant were associated with a lower
risk for severe PPDs. Having a Very Low Birth Weight
baby, any stress 12 months before pregnancy, any physical
abuse before pregnancy, and smoking during pregnancy or
at the time of the survey were all associated with an
increased risk for mild and severe PPDs.
When stratified by race, among White mothers, maternal
and partners’ pregnancy intention was significantly


associated with severe and mild PPDs. Mothers who
reported their pregnancies as unwanted were 2.84 times
more likely (OR 2.84, 95 % CI 1.85–4.35) to report severe
and 1.34 times more likely (OR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.01–1.78)
to report mild PPDs compared to mothers who reported
wanted pregnancies. Mothers who perceived that their
partner did not want the pregnancy were 2.4 times more
likely (OR 2.40, 95 % CI 1.72–3.36) to report severe and

report mild PPDs compared to mothers who perceived that
their partner wanted the pregnancy. However among black
women maternal pregnancy unwantedness was only significantly associated with severe PPDs, with black mothers
who did not want to become pregnant being 1.7 times more
likely to report severe PPDs (OR 1.70, 95 % CI 1.08–2.67)
compared to black mothers who wanted to become pregnant. No association between husbands/partners’ intention
and mothers’ PPDs was found; however, Black mothers
who indicated not wanting the pregnancy but the partner
did were significantly more likely to report severe PPDs
(OR 1.63, 95 % CI 1.00–2.67) For the covariates in the
sample of White women, crudely, associations were statistically significant for biological father’s age, maternal
education, marital status and having insurance before
pregnancy. Among Black women, only maternal education,
physical abuse, and smoking were significant.
Table 3 presents the results from multivariable analysis
among the overall, White and Black samples. After
adjusting for covariates, mothers who had mistimed pregnancies were 20 % more likely to report mild PPDs (aOR
1.19, 95 % CI 1.01–1.41) and mothers who had an
unwanted pregnancies were 1.76 times more likely to
report severe PPDs compared to respondents who intended
to get pregnant (aOR 1.76, 95 % CI 1.23–2.53), with the
strength of this association slightly lower compared to the
crude association from the bivariate analysis. Husbands/partners’ wanting a baby was no longer significantly


associated with most types of PPDs but those participants
whose husbands/partners did not care if their partner
became pregnant were less likely to report severe PPDs
(aOR 0.70, 95 % CI 0.51–0.97) and those whose partner
did not want the pregnancy were more likely to report mild
PPDs (aOR 1.32, 95 % CI 1.02–1.69), even after
accounting for any discordance. Models with discordance
in either direction (mother wanted pregnancy but father did
not, or vice versa) also revealed no significant association
with PPDs after accounting for other covariates. The final
model presents results with any discordance due to larger
cell sizes for stratified analyses. Black respondents were
significantly less likely to have mild PPDs compared with
their White counterparts (aOR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.61–0.86).
Consistent with bivariate analysis results, having a very
low birth weight baby, suffering any abuse before or during
delivery, experiencing any life stress before delivery, and
being a current smoker when interviewed were strongly
associated with self-reported PPDs, with stronger associations observed for severe versus mild PPDs in multivariable multinomial models (Table 3).
Among White participants, women with unwanted
pregnancies were 1.79 times more likely to have severe
PPDs compared with respondents with intended pregnancies after adjusting for covariates (aOR 1.79, 95 % CI
1.07–2.99), but there was no significant difference compared with women with mistimed pregnancies. White

pregnancy were 30 % more likely to report mild PPDs
compared to those whose husbands/partners wanted them
to become pregnant (aOR 1.32, 95 % CI 1.02–1.69).
Among Black women, after controlling for all of the
covariates, neither mother or partner’s pregnancy intention
was associated with mild or severe PPDs. Consistent with
overall sample, experiencing any stress 12 months before
pregnancy, being a victim of any abuse and having a very
low birth weight baby were strongly associated with mild
and severe PPDs among both Black and White mothers.

### Conclusions

The goal of this research was to better understand the
relationship between pregnancy intentions of both the
mother and the father and maternal mental health outcomes. We observed that, compared to mothers who
wanted their pregnancies, those who mistimed or did not
want to conceive, were more likely to report postpartum
depressive affect, with greater associations in unwanted
pregnancies than mistimed pregnancies and for severe
PPDs affect versus mild. The association with not wanting
the pregnancy and severe PPDs was observed overall and
among White but not Black women. Discordance in
intention also played a role in PPDs, although only in crude
analyses. Women who indicated they did not want the
pregnancy but the partner did were significantly more
likely to report severe PPDs; yet, unexpectedly, those who
indicated they wanted the pregnancy but the partner did not
were less likely to have mild PPDs.
We also observed significant differences in PPDs
between Black and White women, with Black women half
as likely to experience mild PPDs compared to White
women, although there was no significant difference in
severe PPDs between racial groups. Results corroborate
previous studies that have observed differences in rates of
postpartum depression across racial and economic groups

[]. However, such differences may also be related to
socioeconomic status or diagnostic biases [59, 60].
Results corroborate findings that women with unwanted
or mistimed pregnancies may be at higher risk of reporting
PPD than women with intended pregnancies [15, 17, 18,
38, 39]. The findings from this study provide an additional
perspective on the relationship between unintended pregnancies and PPD; that there may be a difference in PPDs
severity if the pregnancy was mistimed or unwanted. It
seems appropriate that women who reported their pregnancies as mistimed, they wanted children but not at that
time, were more likely to report mild PPDs. Whereas
women who did not want to get pregnant at all or did not
want any more children, an unwanted pregnancy, were
more likely to report severe PPDs.

It is not entirely clear whether pregnancy intention itself
is a risk factor for PPDs, or if other variables such as
pregnancy outcome, partner support or additional stressors
during pregnancy play a role in the association. An
unwanted or mistimed pregnancy may be indicative of
marital distress, inadequate social support, or potentially
intimate partner violence—all of which have been associated with PPD [26, 31–33, 61]. Others studies utilizing
PRAMS data have noted that some risk factors for postpartum depression are partner-associated stress and physical abuse during pregnancy [55]. We also observed that
physical abuse during pregnancy was one of the strongest
factors in PPDs in this sample, with both Black and White
women being more than three times more likely to experience severe PPDs if they reported any physical abuse than
those women who reported no abuse during pregnancy.
They were approximately two times as likely to experience
mild PPDs compared to women reporting no abuse.
Physical abuse in the adjusted model also attenuated the
impact of partner’s intention, rendering it non-significant
for most associations and potentially indicative of mediation by physical abuse in the partner support-PPDs relation.
While full mediation was not tested in this analysis, this is
an area for future study.
Although mother’s intention to get pregnant is the most
commonly used indicator of pregnancy intention in the
literature, father and/or partner’s intent should be considered and results indicate that this relation may differ by
race. We also observed that mothers with partners who did
not care about or want the pregnancy had higher rates of
reported postpartum depressive affect than mothers whose
partners wanted the pregnancy among White but not Black
women. In adjusted models as well, lack of partner support
was associated with mild PPDs but only among White
women. Having a partner who did not care was protective
against severe PPDs in the sample overall. Research has
shown that partner support during the course of a woman’s
pregnancy is essential to the mother’s health and well-being [13, 41, 44, 62–64]. While we did examine discordance
between the mother and her partner for pregnancy wantedness, the questions posed to mothers about her own
pregnancy wantedness and her partners’ were not the same;
therefore, actual discordance was difficult to define and
with similar questions, may have revealed a greater impact.
Findings from this study are also congruent with previous studies reporting that Louisiana’s unintended pregnancy rates, while comparable to the national average, may
be higher than other states’ averages by at least 10 % [11].
This coupled with research demonstrating that women with
unintended pregnancies are more likely to report PPD
symptomology than women with intended pregnancies
emphasizes the importance for clinicians and public health
professionals to understand this complex relationship


-----

between pregnancy intention and postpartum depressive
affect [7].
Despite important findings, there are key limitations,
including the fact that this study was retrospective assessment of pregnancy intention, which introduces the possibility of recall bias and temporal limitations. The most
accurate measures of pregnancy intention are prospective
and are multi-faceted [19, 65–67], and ideally based on
data from both the mother and father. Women with low
birth weight or preterm infants, may be more likely to
indicate lower levels of pregnancy intention than women
with healthy, full-term babies [68]. Also, women may
misstate pregnancy intention in either direction, resulting
in an unreliable measure [10]. An additional limitation is
the response choices in mother’s and father’s pregnancy
intention, which were different and therefore made simultaneous examination difficulty. Furthermore, partner’s
pregnancy intention was based on mother’s proxy reports
of fathers’ intentions rather than fathers’ own reports.
Furthermore, there is no information on the specifics of the
romantic status of the mothers’ relationship (i.e., together
or separated at the time of the survey or single vs.
cohabitating) which may have an impact on the importance
of partner intention. The self-reported of PPDs is also
retrospective, covers a broad period of time, and is a subjective measure of depression based on one survey question
that is not a derivative of commonly used items. There are
limitations in trying to capture pregnancy intention and
post-partum depressive affect in a single question. Maternal mental health is a complex issue that cannot be diagnosed or even fully captured in a single question, as was
done in this PRAMS dataset. Finally, a cross-sectional
study design does not allow for causal inferences and there
is the possibility for reciprocal associations between retrospective pregnancy intention, perception of partners’
pregnancy intention, and self-reported PPDs.
Findings from this research can be used to aid in the
development and assessment of programs designed to
identify high-risk mothers and reduce adverse mental
health outcomes for mothers [54]. Programs should take
pregnancy intention into consideration when attempting to
identify mothers at an increased risk for PPD, in addition to
other factors such as current and previous stressful life
events, especially physical abuse, but also the cumulative
risk that many women with untended pregnancies may face

[50]. States like Georgia, Oklahoma and Washington have
already used PRAMS data to direct policy and program
initiatives directed at unintended pregnancy. As Louisiana
has a higher level of unintended pregnancies compared to
most states [11], and a relatively high prevalence of
mothers who report PPDs, there is an increased impetus to
utilize evidenced based findings to inform programs and
practice. Clinicians and healthcare providers should also be


aware of the intention of the mother and of her partner in
preparing for the postnatal period. While policy and program initiatives to address unintended pregnancies may be
beneficial, results from this study stress the importance of
considering racial differences in both pregnancy intention
and PPDs report in order to most effectively address negative mental health outcomes. The influence of unintended
pregnancies is complex and this study contributes to the
limited information on the role that partner pregnancy
intention plays on maternal mental health outcomes [16].
