## From Antenatal to Postnatal Depression: Associated Factors and Mitigating Influences

### Maggie Redshaw, BA, PhD, C Psychol and Jane Henderson, BSc, MSc, RM

Abstract

### Introduction: Postnatal depression has a serious impact on new mothers and their children and families. Risk factors identified include a history of depression, multiparity, and young age. The study aimed to investigate factors associated with experiencing antenatal depression and developing subsequent postnatal depression. Methods: The study utilized survey data from 5332 women about their experience and well-being during pregnancy, in labor, and postnatally up to 3 months. Prespecified sociodemographic and clinical variables were tabulated against the incidence of antenatal depression and postnatal depression. Binary logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of the principal underlying variables. Results: Risk factors for antenatal depression were multiparity, black and minority ethnic (BME) status, physical or mental health problems, living in a deprived area, and unplanned pregnancy. Different factors for postnatal depression were evident among women who had experienced antenatal depression: multiparity and BME status were protective, whereas being left alone in labor and experiencing poor postnatal health increased the risk of postnatal depression. Conclusion: This study confirms previous research on risk factors for antenatal depression and stresses the importance of continuous support in labor and vigilance in the postnatal period regarding the potential ill effects of continuing postnatal health problems.


Introduction

ntenatal depression is recognized as a major risk
factor for postnatal depression.[1–3] Rates of postnatal
# A
depression are reported at between 9% and 15%,[4] and for
antenatal depression at between 7% and 22% depending on
severity and the timing of data collection.[5–8] Risk factors for
antenatal depression include young maternal age, less than 12
years of education, chronic medical conditions, Asian and
African American ethnicity,[8] single parenthood, and having
an unwanted pregnancy.[6] Risk factors for postnatal depression appear to be similar,[3] being associated with a history of
depression, antenatal depression, antenatal anxiety, stressful
life events, negative cognitive attributional style, low selfesteem, low social support, and low income.[9] Other suggested
risk factors for postnatal depression include young age, lower
levels of education, a history of miscarriage and pregnancy
termination, and a history of childhood sexual abuse.[10]

Many studies of perinatal depression utilize relatively
small numbers of women, often associated with specific
hospitals providing obstetric care and community medical


practices and in areas that differ in terms of the degree of
disadvantage.[8,11–13] This may account for some of the variation in the proportions of women being identified as experiencing depression in the antenatal and postnatal periods.
Babies of women suffering from postnatal depression
have been found to be more likely to experience the consequences of poor attachment and impaired interactions,
leading to impaired cognitive outcomes,[14,15] with longer
term outcomes being of concern if the postnatal depression is
severe or chronic.[10] However, not all studies report similar
findings. With a recent large, population-based sample of
women, neither maternal history of depressive disorder nor
maternal depressive symptoms either during pregnancy or
postnatally were found to be related to later mother–infant
attachment.[16]

While associations have been found between antenatal
depression and its occurrence in the postpartum period,[4,13] it
is not clear if there are mitigating factors that can influence
whether a woman who experiences antenatal depression goes
on to have postnatal depression. Thus, the aim of this study
was, first, to investigate some of the factors associated with

antenatal depression in this population, and second, for those
women who had antenatal depression, to determine which
factors appear to influence depression being experienced
subsequently in the postnatal period.

Methods

This study used analysis of secondary data from a recent
survey of new mothers. A random sample of 10,000 women
aged 16 years and over who had their baby in a 2-week
period in England were selected by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) from birth registrations. Mothers of babies
that had died and those less than 16 years at the time of the
baby’s birth were excluded from the sample. Women were
sent a questionnaire, invitation letter, information leaflet,
and an information sheet in a range of languages when the
babies were 3 months of age in January 2010. All were offered the option of completing the survey online using individual log-ins. Tailored reminders were sent to those who
had not responded: initially a letter 2 weeks after the first
mailing, a further questionnaire after 4 weeks, and a further
letter 4 weeks later.[17]

A range of questions about women’s health, clinical care,
and perception of care during the antenatal, intrapartum, and
postnatal periods care were asked, including whether the
woman had experienced depression antenatally or postnatally. For the purposes of this analysis, which focused on
outcomes at 3 months, ‘‘blues’’ was combined with postnatal
depression since blues do not generally continue to 3 months.
A list of variables indicated by the literature to be associated
with antenatal or postnatal depression was constructed and
grouped into sociodemographic and clinical variables (see
Appendix 1). Two independent sets of analyses were done,
the first relating to antenatal depression, the second relating
to postnatal depression. In the first set of analyses, sociodemographic variables were tabulated against reported
antenatal depression using chi-square statistics and a significance level set at p < 0.01 (due to the size of the dataset and the
number of variables). These variables were then entered into a


multivariate binary logistic regression model, with a significance level set at p < 0.05, to ascertain the key variables at this
stage. Antenatal clinical variables were also tabulated against
antenatal depression in the same way. The second set of analyses concentrated solely on those women who had experienced antenatal depression. Sociodemographic and clinical
care variables were tabulated against postnatal depression in
univariate analyses followed by multivariate binary logistic
regression of significant variables to explore associations with
postnatal depression. In the multivariate models, analyses
were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and also those
variables that were significant in the univariate analyses.
Significance levels for these analyses were set at p < 0.05 due to
the smaller numbers. Analyses were carried out using SPSSX
version 17.

Results

The response rate to the survey was 55.1%, with 5332
women providing usable responses, 8% of which were on-line
returns. Summary demographic data on respondents and
nonrespondents were provided by ONS. The respondents
were largely representative of the whole population; however, as with most surveys of this kind, younger women, those
living in more disadvantaged areas, women who were not
married, those from BME groups, and those born outside the
United Kingdom were less likely to respond.[17–19] Nevertheless 22% of respondents were born outside the United
Kingdom, 14% came from BME groups, and 12% were single
parents.
A total of 475 women (9.6%) responded positively to the
question in the antenatal section about depression during
their pregnancy: ‘‘Did you experience depression or seek help
for depression from a midwife or a doctor?’’ Of these women
only half (4.5%) reported seeking help for depression at this
time. Of those women reporting depression during pregnancy, just over a third (35%) went on to report having
postnatal depression at 10 days, 25% at 1 month, and 21% at 3
months (Fig. 1). This is compared to 5% at each time point in

postnatal depression at 3 months in

women who were not depressed antenatally. Outcomes were
also poorer in women with antenatal depression in terms of
general health and well-being. When asked how they felt
physically in the first few days after the birth and, again, at
3 months after the birth, women who had experienced
antenatal depression rated their health as significantly worse
than those who were not depressed antenatally. For example, 10% of women in the antenatally depressed group
reporting feeling ‘‘very well’’ in the first few days, compared
to 18% among other respondents. At 3 months the difference
was greater with the comparable proportions being 10% and
28%, respectively.
Based on the literature on maternal mental health and
well-being during pregnancy and postnatally,[1–8] a range of
variables was selected for analysis (see Appendix 1 for list).
Univariate analysis indicated that some sociodemographic,
possibly predictive, factors associated with antenatal depression were multiparity; young age; young age on completing full-time education or still being in full-time
education; being from a BME group (especially black or black
British); being a single parent; living in a very deprived area;
having long-term physical or, more particularly, mental
health problems, especially if these limited day-to-day activities; and having an unplanned, unwanted pregnancy (Table
1). Women with antenatal depression were also more likely to
experience other antenatal health problems; for example, repeated vomiting (42% compared with 20%), carpel tunnel
syndrome (21% compared with 11%), and stress incontinence
(26% compared with 9%; data not shown).
There is a degree of overlap between the factors listed as
associated with reporting antenatal depression, and therefore
binary logistic regression was used to determine the principal
underlying variables. The results (Table 2) suggest that women from BME groups and more deprived areas are at increased risk of antenatal depression, as are multiparous
women, those with long-term mental health problems or
learning disabilities, and women with unplanned, unwanted
pregnancies.
In terms of clinical factors and service use, women who
experienced antenatal depression were generally seen significantly later in pregnancy, were less likely to have a dating or
anomaly scan, were less likely to be offered or attend National
Health Service (NHS) antenatal classes; screening for Down’s
syndrome was more likely to be by nuchal scan or nuchal scan
plus a blood test, but the women were also less likely to recall
being offered the test. Women reporting antenatal depression
were nearly twice as likely to have experienced an overnight
stay in hospital during the pregnancy and were also more
than twice as likely to have long-term health problems affecting this or previous pregnancies (Table 3).
In terms of communication with staff in the antenatal period, women having antenatal depression were significantly
more likely to feel that during pregnancy one or more midwives did not talk to them so they could understand and did
not treat them with respect or kindness. The same was true in
terms of communication with medical staff. These results are
also summarized in Table 3.
In the subgroup of women who had experienced antenatal
depression, specific sociodemographic, clinical, and care factors were significantly associated with also experiencing
postnatal depression three months after the birth. The results
of these univariate analyses are shown in Tables 4 and 5. In

contrast to the previous results, multiparous women and
those from BME groups were at reduced risk of postnatal
depression. However, those with long-term mental health
problems or learning disabilities, poor physical health postnatally, or dissatisfaction with postnatal care generally and
those who experienced poor interactions with some midwifery and medical staff reported higher rates of depression at
3 months. Mode of delivery was not associated with postnatal
depression.
The factors that were significant in the univariate analyses
were then used as independent variables in a binary logistic
regression with depression at 3 months postpartum as the
dependent variable. This analysis was also limited to women
who had experienced antenatal depression. As shown in

women who reported depression during the antenatal period
also had postnatal depression at 3 months after giving birth
appeared to be related to having long-term mental health
problems or learning disabilities, being left alone and worried
in labor or shortly after the birth, having postnatal health
problems at 1 month (but not at 10 days), and women feeling
physically unwell at the time of the survey. Surprisingly,
those women who were depressed in both the antenatal and
postnatal periods, reported greater satisfaction with postnatal
care overall.

Discussion

The risk factors for antenatal depression found in this study
are consistent with those reported in other studies of antenatal
depression: ethnicity, social disadvantage, multiparity, longterm mental health problems or learning disabilities, and an
unwanted pregnancy.[2,6,8,10,20] The rate based on self-report is
within the range of what has been variously reported, including data from recent large population-based studies[21,22]

in which rates of antenatal depression of 9% and 10% were
described.
Service use for women with antenatal depression was significantly less than for other women: they booked later and
consequently had fewer antenatal checks, were less likely to
have ultrasound scans, and they were less likely to recall being offered screening for Down’s syndrome. Depressed women suffered more antenatal morbidity having more
overnight hospital admissions during pregnancy and more
long-term health problems. This is consistent with other
studies in this area, emphasizing the value of screening for
and monitoring maternal health at this time.[8,23,24] Quality of
staff interaction was also significant. Women who felt they

were spoken to so that they could understand and treated
with respect and kindness antenatally by both midwives and
doctors were less likely to report suffering from antenatal
depression. It may also be that women who were also depressed postnatally have more negative perceptions of staff
interactions than nondepressed women. However, that this
group were in fact, more likely to report being satisfied or
very satisfied with their postnatal care would argue against
this interpretation. As has been pointed out,[7] depression may
contribute to slower recovery after childbirth, but it is also
likely that physical health problems contribute to depression
at both time points.
In a relatively small-scale study of couples during the
transition to parenthood, the proportion of women with antenatal depression, who then at 3 months after the birth reported postnatal depression was 21%.[25] However, studies
that have followed women further, to the end of the first year
and beyond, have described something of a U-shaped pattern
over time, with some women initially adapting to their early
parenting role but then experiencing distress later, perhaps
when combining parenting with return to work and coping
with greater pressures in the couple relationship.[21]

For those women who were depressed antenatally, risk
factors for postnatal depression were different: being multiparous and from a BME group appeared to be protective.
However, being left alone and worried in labor or shortly after
the birth, and poor physical health postnatally were associ

ated with higher rates of postnatal depression. Mode of delivery was not associated with postnatal depression in this
group of women, which is consistent with some studies in this
area [26] but not others.[27] That women at higher risk of postnatal depression, having been depressed antenatally, were
more satisfied with postnatal care may indicate that staff
perceived their vulnerability and acted accordingly. The only
variable that was significantly associated with both antenatal
and postnatal depression was long-term mental health problems or learning disabilities. This is not surprising because
depression constitutes a significant component of mental
health problems generally, and a history of depression is a
significant risk factor for perinatal depression.[28]

A strength of this study is that it was based on a large
population-based national survey with more than 5000 respondents. Some studies have shown that women may be
reluctant to discuss their own health at postnatal or later
checks during the early months after childbirth,[29] and poor
disclosure of emotional problems means that medical or
hospital-based records may well underrepresent the extent of
maternal morbidity. Thus survey responses, which women
make anonymously, may better reflect their health and wellbeing.[30]

A limitation of this study is that the response rate to the
survey was 55%. However, this is similar to that found with
other national or state surveys,[31] and respondents and nonrespondents were similar except that younger, single women,
those born outside the United Kingdom, and women living in
the most deprived areas were underrepresented. Despite being underrepresented, significant numbers of these women
responded to the survey. A further limitation was that the
occurrence of antenatal and postnatal depression was based
on women’s report without independent verification, and
only some women reported seeking help for this. The survey
responses may have also been affected by recall bias if women
suffering from postnatal depression at the time of completing
the questionnaire were more likely to recall problems than
women who were feeling well. However, the reported rates
are similar to those in the literature and the responses, reflecting perceptions of services and care by this group, were
not uniform or universally critical.
This study illustrates different possible associations and
influences on women with antenatal depression, and factors
associated with subsequent postnatal depression. Long-term
mental health problems, high-risk pregnancy, and not recovering well after childbirth are clearly important factors,[32]

but the quality of postnatal care may also be an important
mitigating influence. Further research could focus on anxiety
and depression and the factors associated with comorbidity
both before and following childbirth. Clinical implications of
the study largely center around health care professionals
working with women being aware that depression in the
antenatal period may signal the possibility of postnatal depression occurring after the birth. The National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical management
and service guidance for women with mental health problems
in pregnancy and postnatally recommends the development
of a trusting relationship with the woman and, if appropriate,
her family, and being sensitive to shame and stigma that can
occur in relation to mental illness.[33] Midwives and health
visitors helping women in the postnatal period should be
aware of the higher rates of depression in women with

significant and continuing postnatal health problems. Sensitivity to vulnerable women’s support needs and health during
pregnancy, in labor and in the months after birth is also likely
to contribute to the kind of individualized care which women
themselves recognize and value.
Current knowledge on this subject:

 - Antenatal depression is a major risk factor for postnatal
depression

 - Babies of women suffering from postnatal depression are
at risk of poor attachment

 - Risk factors for antenatal and postnatal depression include socioeconomic and clinical factors

What this study adds:

 - Risk factors for postnatal depression among women who
have experienced antenatal depression differ from risk
factors for postnatal depression generally

 - The only factor common to both antenatal and postnatal
depression was long-term mental health problems or
learning disability

 - Interactions with staff, particularly in the postnatal period, may be an important ameliorating factor
