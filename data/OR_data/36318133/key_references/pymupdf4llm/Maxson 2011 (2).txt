## Pregnancy Intention, Demographic Differences, and Psychosocial Health

### Pamela Maxson, Ph.D., and Marie Lynn Miranda, Ph.D.

Abstract

### Objectives: We explore the psychosocial, demographic, and maternal characteristics across wanted, mistimed, and unwanted pregnancies. Methods: Data from 1321 women from a prospective cohort study of pregnant women in Durham, NC, are analyzed. Psychosocial correlates were obtained through prenatal surveys; electronic medical records were used to ascertain maternal health and pregnancy outcomes. Results: Sixty-two percent of the women indicated an unintended pregnancy, with 44% (578) mistimed and 18% (245) unwanted. Only 38% of the pregnancies were characterized as wanted. Women with unwanted and with mistimed pregnancies were similar demographically, but they differed significantly on psychosocial profiles and maternal characteristics. Women with mistimed and with wanted pregnancies differed in demographics and psychosocial profiles. Wanted pregnancies had the healthiest, mistimed an intermediate, and unwanted the poorest psychosocial profile. Women with unwanted pregnancies had the highest depression, perceived stress, and negative paternal support scores ( p < 0.05) and the lowest self-efficacy, social support, and positive paternal support scores ( p < 0.05). In multivariate analyses, women with riskier psychosocial profiles had higher odds of being in the unwanted category. Controlling for psychosocial and demographic variables, perceived stress and positive paternal support remained significant predictors of belonging to the unwanted and mistimed groups. Conclusions: Fully characterizing pregnancy intention and its relationship to psychosocial profiles may provide a basis for identifying women with highest risk during pregnancy and early motherhood. Women with un- wanted and mistimed pregnancies may appear similar demographically but are different psychosocially. Wo- men with unwanted pregnancies have multiple risk factors and would benefit from targeted interventions.


Introduction

espite the Healthy People 2010 goal of decreasing
unintended pregnancies to 30%, the United States ex# D
periences consistently high rates, ranging from 40% to 65%.[1–3]

Unintended pregnancy remains a vital public health issue, as
it has been associated with delayed and inadequate prenatal
care,[4,5] higher rates of low birth weight and preterm birth
infants,[4–9] infant mortality,[5,7] risky behaviors during pregnancy,[10–12] maternal morbidity and mortality,[4,13] and increased medical costs.[14]

Pregnancy intention varies by demographic characteristics,
with unintended pregnancies reported more often in women
who are black,[13,15,16] unmarried,[13,15,16] less educated,[13,15,16]

and enrolled in Medicaid.[16] In one study, women without
high school diplomas were three times more likely to have an
unintended pregnancy than women with college degrees.[1]

Importantly, although the proportion of unintended preg

nancies is highest among teens, women aged ‡ 20 account for
the largest number of unintended pregnancies.[1,17] These demographic characteristics have been linked, independent of
intention, to adverse pregnancy outcomes,[18–20] and the relationship between pregnancy intention and birth outcomes
attenuates in some cases after adjusting for maternal socioeconomic variables.[15,21] An unintended pregnancy may be an
additional stressor during pregnancy and may modify a
woman’s psychosocial health, contributing to the risk of adverse outcomes.
As the rates for unintended pregnancy have remained high
despite multiple and varied intervention strategies,[1,22,23] researchers have incorporated a more nuanced definition of intention to better understand the problem and thus design more
effective intervention programs.[4,13,24–28] Conventionally, the
literature has divided pregnancy into two categories: intended
and unintended.[15,29] This dichotomous classification combines mistimed and unwanted pregnancies into one category,

unintended. A mistimed pregnancy may be inherently different from an unwanted pregnancy. For example, D’Angelo
et al.[24] found that the majority of births (57%) were intended.
When the 43% unintended category was broken down, however, 32% of births were mistimed, leaving 11% of the births
unwanted. Women who report an unwanted pregnancy often
are older than women who report a mistimed pregnancy,[16,24]

suggesting that the context of an unwanted pregnancy likely
differs from the context of a mistimed pregnancy. Therefore, it
may not be valid to combine these two categories.
Psychosocial health has been found to differ among intention status. Although the work on psychosocial health is still
relatively new,[5] Orr and Miller[30] were at the forefront over a
decade ago, comparing psychosocial health among women
with wanted, mistimed, and unwanted pregnancies. They
found that women with unwanted pregnancies had the
highest levels of depression and exposure to stress and the
lowest levels of support. Women with mistimed pregnancies
were intermediate between women with unwanted and
wanted pregnancies. Urging cautious interpretation, Orr and
Miller emphasize the risks of unwanted and mistimed pregnancies to the well-being of these women. Similarly, in more
recent research, women with unintended pregnancies have
reported higher levels of depression,[16,31,32] higher levels of
stress,[32] and lower levels of well-being.[33]

This current work complements the existing literature on
pregnancy intention by focusing on demographic and psychosocial profiles, with an emphasis on whether these profiles
differ across intention status, particularly unwanted and
mistimed pregnancies. We define the psychosocial profile as
the constellation of depression, self-efficacy, paternal support,
social support, and perceived stress, an indicator of psychosocial health involving strengths and strains. We use an ongoing prospective cohort study of pregnant women in
Durham County, NC, and categorize intention as wanted,
mistimed, or unwanted. This allows for more systematic
comparisons across maternal subgroups, including an analysis of whether mothers with mistimed vs. unwanted pregnancies constitute different subgroups.

Materials and Methods

The Healthy Pregnancy, Healthy Baby Study is an ongoing
prospective cohort study designed to examine the effects of
environmental, social, and host factors on racial disparities in
pregnancy outcomes. The study, part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)-funded Southern Center
on Environmentally Driven Disparities in Birth Outcomes
(SCEDDBO), enrolls pregnant women from the Duke Obstetrics Clinic and the Durham County Health Department
Prenatal Clinic. Women receiving prenatal care at these sites
were eligible to participate if they were at least 18 years of age,
English literate, between 18 and 28 weeks of gestation at study
enrollment, lived in Durham County, were planning on delivering at Duke University Medical Center, and did not have
a multiple gestation or any known fetal genetic or congenital
abnormalities.
Demographic, health behavior, and medical history data
were obtained by direct patient interview and through electronic medical record review at the time of enrollment. Information on events of the pregnancy, labor and delivery, and
health of the neonate were ascertained from maternal and


neonatal electronic medical records. Psychosocial profiles
were assessed through a variety of survey instruments given
between 18 and 28 weeks gestation, including the Fragile
Families and Child Well-Being Survey,[34] the Perceived Stress
Scale (PSS),[35] the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List
(ISEL),[36] the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
Scale (CES-D),[37] and the Jerusalem and Schwarzer instrument
for assessing self-efficacy.[38]

Pregnancy intention

Pregnancy intention was assessed with a module developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) in its Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System
(PRAMS) study.[39] This question asks the mother to think back
to just before she became pregnant with this child and indicate
how she felt about becoming pregnant. Response choices include wanting to become pregnant sooner, later, at that time,
or not at all. We combined responses indicating wanting to
become pregnant sooner and at that time as wanted. We
classified later as mistimed and not at all as unwanted.

CES-D scale

Depression was assessed using the CES-D scale.[37] Designed for use in nonpsychiatric samples from the general
population, it has excellent psychometric properties.

Fragile Families Survey

The relationship with the biological father was assessed
with a battery of questions taken from the Fragile Families
and Child Well-Being Survey.[34] The module assesses the
amount of supportiveness and conflict present in the relationship. In a nationally representative survey, these measures were significant predictors of marital and romantic
status.[40] Positive paternal support comprises understanding,
affection, listening, and empathy. Negative paternal support
comprises critical, controlling, and abusive behaviors.

Perceived Stress Scale

The PSS assesses subjective experience of stress.[21] PSS items
tap the degree to which individuals feel that events in their
lives are unpredictable and uncontrollable. Comparisons of
the 10-item version with the original 14-item version of the
scale reveal that the shorter version is psychometrically superior; Cronbach’s alpha reliability was 0.78.

Interpersonal Support Evaluation List

The ISEL[22] is used to assess several dimensions of social
support, including self-esteem, tangible social support, belonging, and satisfaction with supports; Cronbach’s alpha
was between 0.80 and 0.89.

Self-Efficacy Scale

Self-efficacy is measured using the 10-item Jerusalem and
Schwarzer General Self-Efficacy Scale. This module measures
how well respondents can cope with daily hassles and their
ability to adapt to stressful circumstances; Cronbach’s alpha
for this module ranges from 0.76 to 0.90.[38]

This analysis includes women enrolled between study inception in June 2005 and September 2010. Of the 1743 women


-----

enrolled in the study, 85 were excluded from analysis because
they did not report pregnancy intention. An additional 155
women were excluded because of missing data on at least one
demographic covariate (race, age, education, income, marital
status). Because there were small numbers of Hispanics and
Asians, we restricted this analysis to non-Hispanic black (NHB)
(oversampling intentional) and non-Hispanic white (NHW)
women. Thus, 1321 women were included in these analyses.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was run to compare the
three groups in terms of demographics, psychosocial profiles,
and pregnancy outcomes. In addition, multivariate analyses
controlling for demographic characteristics previously found
to be related to pregnancy intention were performed with
multinomial logistic regression. The Healthy Pregnancy,
Healthy Baby Study and all associated analyses are conducted
according to a research protocol approved by Duke’s Institutional Review Board. All analyses were run using STATA
10 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

Results

Sample characteristics

Demographic characteristics of the sample can be found in
Table 1. The sample is predominantly low income, with 51%
of the women reporting annual incomes of < $20,000. In addition, 77% of the sample are NHB, 72% are single, and 73%
are on Medicaid or are without health insurance. The mean
age of women enrolled in the study is 26.2 years, with 45% of
the sample < age 25. Sixty-two percent of the women indi

cated that the pregnancy was unintended, with 44% (578)
mistimed and 18% (245) unwanted. Only 38% of the pregnancies were characterized as wanted.

Demographic differences across intention categories

Significant demographic differences exist across the three
intention categories (Table 1). Women who reported an unwanted pregnancy were more likely than those who reported
a wanted pregnancy to have lower incomes, be NHB, have
lower educational attainment, be single, and have three or
more children. Whereas the demographic differences were
pronounced between the unwanted and wanted categories,
the unwanted and mistimed groups were similar on most
demographic characteristics. The unwanted and mistimed
groups were not statistically different on percent NHB, income, marital status, or education. The only statistically significant demographic differences between the unwanted and
mistimed groups were that women with mistimed pregnancies were younger and less likely to have three or more children than the unwanted category. Women with wanted
pregnancies were significantly more likely to be married and
less likely to be NHB and have higher incomes and educational attainment than either of the other two groups
( p < 0.0001).

Maternal characteristics across intention categories

Maternal characteristics played an important role in pregnancy intention as well (Table 2). Compared to women who

reported a wanted or a mistimed pregnancy, women who
reported an unwanted pregnancy were significantly more
likely to have had a previous preterm birth ( p < 0.0001). They
were also more likely to have had a previous therapeutic
(optional) abortion ( p < 0.01). Further, they were less likely to
be having their first child ( p < 0.0001). Interestingly, 18% of the
unwanted group were having their first child.

Psychosocial differences across intention categories

The psychosocial characteristics reflected the ordinal nature of the intention groups (Table 3). Generally, we might
have increasing concern for maternal and fetal health as one
moves along the continuum from wanted to mistimed to
unwanted pregnancies. Women who are trying to get pregnant may be more likely to have considered their preconception health and habits than women in both other
categories, and the women whose pregnancies are mistimed
may be more likely to adjust their habits in response to their
pregnancy than women who do not want to be pregnant at all.
We see this ordinal nature of the categories playing out in the
psychosocial characteristics as well. Women who reported
their pregnancy as wanted have significantly better psychosocial characteristics than women who reported their pregnancy as mistimed, whose characteristics were significantly
better than those of women who reported their pregnancy as
unwanted (Table 3). It should be noted that although the
mean depression score among women who reported their
pregnancy as unwanted (18.0) was above the cutoff for clinical
depression in the general population (16), the pregnancy
cutoff is generally higher due to the physical similarities in
some of the symptoms of pregnancy and depression (fatigue,


sleep changes).[30,32,41] Women with wanted pregnancies
scored much lower on depression, with a mean score of 12.4,
and those in the mistimed category had an intermediate average score of 15.1. Self-efficacy, a measure of a sense of
control, was significantly lower in the unwanted group
compared to the wanted group, but not statistically different
from the mistimed group. Perceived stress was significantly
higher in the unwanted group compared to the mistimed and
wanted groups and was significantly higher in the the mistimed group than in the wanted group.
Women with unwanted pregnancies had significantly
lower levels of social support, as measured by the ISEL
checklist. Additionally, women with unwanted pregnancies
had statistically significantly higher levels of negative paternal support and statistically significantly lower levels of
positive paternal support compared to the other two groups
(Table 3).

Multivariate analyses

The ANOVA results provide important insights, but multivariate analysis is required to fully understand membership
of intention categories. Analyses controlled for maternal race,
maternal age, maternal education, marital status, income, and
having three or more children. Table 4 presents the base
model, containing only the covariates. Comparing unwanted
with wanted pregnancies, the significant predictors were being NHB (OR 4.64, CI 2.48-8.68), being single (OR 2.38, CI
1.44-3.93), higher income (OR 0.40, CI 0.22-0.74), and having
three or more children (OR 2.74, CI 1.69-4.44). Predictors
varied for the mistimed/wanted comparison. Race dropped
significance, but age gained significance. Being in the age

categories of 18–19 and 20–24 made it more likely that one
would be in the mistimed group (OR 2.7, CI 1.7-4.3; OR 1.8, CI
1.3-2.6). Conversely, being ‡ 35 reduced the odds of being in
the mistimed group (OR 0.4, CI 0.2-0.7). Being NHB (OR 3.7,
CI 2.0-7.1), younger (18–19: OR 0.4, CI 0.3-0.7; 20–24: OR 0.5,
CI 0.3-0.7; ‡ 35: OR 3.5, CI 1.8-6.9), and having three or more
children (OR 2.2, CI 1.4-3.5) predicted membership in the
unwanted vs. mistimed category.
Before adding the psychosocial health measures to the
multivariate, multinomial model for intention status, we
present Table 5 showing the distribution of each psychosocial
survey score in the sample population of participants reporting all demographic covariates (note, about 10% of participants did not report income and were excluded here).
Higher scores on the surveys measuring perceived stress,
depression, and negative paternal support are associated with
higher risk psychosocial health (i.e. more perceived stress,
more depression, and more negative paternal support).
Lower scores on the surveys measuring self-efficacy, social
support, and positive paternal support are associated with


higher risk psychosocial health (i.e. lower self-efficacy, less
social support and less positive paternal support).
Psychosocial variables also predicted intention group
membership (Table 6). Table 6 presents the crude, covariateadjusted, and fully adjusted models. In comparing the unwanted and wanted groups, all psychosocial variables independently significantly distinguished the unwanted and
wanted groups. Higher scores on depression, perceived
stress, and negative paternal support increased the likelihood
that one would be in the unwanted group. Conversely, higher
scores on social support and positive paternal support decreased the likelihood that one would be in the unwanted
group. The covariates in the base model remained similar
with the addition of each psychosocial variable. When covariates are added to the model, higher scores on depression,
perceived stress, and negative paternal support predicted
being in the unwanted as compared to the wanted group. In
the fully adjusted model, which includes the covariates as
well as all psychosocial measures, higher levels of perceived
stress significantly increased the likelihood (OR 1.7, CI 1.1

2.7), and higher levels of positive parental support significantly reduced the likelihood (OR 0.5, CI 0.4-0.8) of being in
the unwanted group (as compared to wanted).
When comparing the mistimed and wanted groups, all
variables except self-efficacy predicted group membership, with higher scores on depression, perceived stress,
and negative paternal support increasing the likelihood
and higher scores on social support and positive paternal
support decreasing the likelihood of being in the mistimed
vs. the wanted group. Including the covariates attenuated
the relationships, leaving perceived stress (OR 1.3, CI 1.11.6) and positive paternal support (OR 0.7, CI 0.5-0.9)
significantly differentiating the groups. The fully adjusted
model follows the same pattern, with perceived stress
increasing and positive paternal support decreasing the
odds of being in the mistimed group (compared to the
wanted).
The unwanted and mistimed groups differed on all psychosocial characteristics in the unadjusted models. When the
covariates are added to the model, higher scores on depression, perceived stress, and negative paternal support significantly increase the likelihood and higher scores on social
support and positive paternal support significantly decrease
the likelihood that one is in the unwanted as compared to the
mistimed group. In the fully adjusted model, the relationships
are attenuated.

Pregnancy outcome differences across
intention categories


ANOVA analyses of the three groups indicate statistically
significant differences in birth weight and gestational age. In
pairwise comparisons, mean birth weight was significantly
lower in the unwanted group compared to the other two
groups (unwanted = 3000 g; mistimed = 3083 g; wanted = 3144 g,
p < 0.05). Similarly, mean gestational age was significantly
lower for the unwanted group (unwanted = 37.7; mistimed =
38.1; wanted = 38.1, p < 0.05). The disparity increased even
more when dichotomizing on spontaneous delivery rather
than clinically indicated induction at < 32 weeks (unwanted,
4%; mistimed, 1%; wanted, 1%, p < 0.05). These statistical
differences were attenuated in multivariate analyses, with the
covariates accounting for differences in birth weight and
gestational age.

Discussion


This analysis examined the maternal and psychosocial
contributors to intention status in an ongoing prospective
cohort study. In our sample, the unwanted and mistimed
pregnancies were similar demographically but markedly
different on psychosocial health measures and maternal
characteristics. Unwanted pregnancies also differed from
wanted pregnancies demographically and psychosocially.
The mistimed and wanted groups differed in both areas as
well.
The psychosocial differences among the groups merit further elucidation. Our findings complement previous research
that psychosocial health differs across pregnancy intention
groups.[16,30–33] Similar to earlier research, our unwanted
group has a risky profile, experiencing high levels of depression, perceived stress, and negative paternal support along
with low levels of self-efficacy and support, both general and

paternal. Looking holistically at this psychosocial profile and
the at-risk demographic profile, these women are at substantial risk. It is unlikely that these profiles will change when
the pregnancy is over; rather, these risks are often long term
and not easily ameliorated. Especially important is the finding
that these women report high levels of perceived stress, with
corresponding low levels of paternal support, even after
controlling for all other psychosocial and demographic covariates. Further, although the relationships between intention
and birth weight and gestational age are attenuated when
controlling for covariates, women with unwanted pregnancies have mean lower birth weights and earlier deliveries. It is
important to explore why some women have repeated unwanted pregnancies. Over one third of the women in the
unwanted category had previously had an elective abortion,
with 12% having had more than one abortion. Our data indicate that serial unwanted pregnancies constitute a significant public health problem. Women who already have three
or more children at home may be at particular risk for contextual stress with a lack of appropriate support, potentially
impacting maternal mental and physical health as well as
long-term parenting ability.
Another interesting subset of women who reported an
unwanted pregnancy is the 18% who are pregnant with their
first child. Many would expect that these women would report that their pregnancy is mistimed rather than unwanted.
Further elucidation of these women’s context and motivation
would be worthwhile. Even within the same intention category, women may differ dramatically.
We argue that the three categories of intention—unwanted,
mistimed, and wanted—more appropriately identify intention phenotypes as compared to the more traditional intended
vs. unintended dichotomization. A woman who becomes
pregnant earlier than expected may react and behave differently from either a woman who becomes pregnant when
planned or one who does not want the pregnancy at all.
Further, the women who reported a wanted pregnancy may
have already begun preparing for the pregnancy through
recommended lifestyle changes. Our results agree with previous research that indicates that combining the unwanted
and mistimed groups masks important differences between
the groups,[11,13,15,16,24,28,30,42] with clinical implications in
needs assessment and ancillary service delivery, such as social
work.
Our study has several limitations. Self-reported pregnancy intention has inherent issues. The acceptance of admitting an unwanted or mistimed pregnancy may vary by
culture. We are limited in our ability to address this, as our
sample is predominantly NHB. In addition, given that the
pregnancy intention question is asked at the time of enrollment, which is between 18 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, when
women have already chosen to carry their pregnancies to
term, self-reports may not be wholly reliable. Pregnancy
intention has the potential to change depending on when the
woman is asked.[21] We also may negatively bias our estimate
of unwanted pregnancies because we fail to capture the
women who decide to terminate the pregnancy before 18
weeks as well as limit enrollment to women who are £ 28
weeks pregnant, thereby eliminating women with unwanted
pregnancies who may be more likely to initiate prenatal care
late. We note, however, that the CDC’s intention questionnaire within PRAMS, an important source of information on


pregnancy intention in the United States, is implemented
after delivery. Our sample is limited to women > 18 years of
age, eliminating many teen pregnancies, which are a highrisk group for mistimed pregnancies. Considering 62% of
our participants indicated an unintended pregnancy, the
potential negative bias indicates that unintended pregnancy
is a serious public health concern.
Future research should explore the distinction between
unwanted and mistimed pregnancies in other cohorts to
confirm the results presented here. In addition, research is
needed to understand and prevent the high rates of unwanted and mistimed pregnancies, with a particular emphasis on unwanted pregnancies, given the greater risk these
women pose. Additional barriers to pregnancy planning,
beyond access to contraceptive services, should be identified
so public health systems can effectively work on breaking
down these barriers. Given the significant numbers of unwanted pregnancies that occur in multiparas (81% of the
women in our unwanted group), intervention research
aimed at high-risk women in the immediate postnatal period
appears warranted.
Additional studies are needed that refine the measurement
of pregnancy intention. Ideally, the question would be asked
at pregnancy confirmation, reducing the potential for recall
bias. Quantifying the degree of mistiming of a pregnancy
would be helpful, as a pregnancy that is 1 year earlier than
desired is inherently different from one that is 10 years early.
Asking women and their partners about the dimensions of
intention (trying to get pregnant, happiness regarding pregnancy)[25] would clarify what it means for a pregnancy to be
intended or unintended.

Conclusions

Pregnancy intention is an important indicator of a woman’s
readiness to bear a child, her mental and physical health, and
her sociodemographic context. Although preventing unintended pregnancies remains an important public health objective, understanding the contributors to unwanted and
mistimed pregnancies elucidates large concurrent risk factors.
In our cohort, women who report unwanted pregnancies,
especially those who have recurring unwanted pregnancies,
appear to be the most distinct and at highest risk. Having an
unwanted pregnancy does not mean these women will not
want or love their infant.[43] However, knowing the demographic and psychosocial risks, clinicians could make referrals
for services so these women get the support they need to
reduce stress and enhance resiliency. Preventing mistimed
and unwanted pregnancies is important; further, in clinical
practice, identifying the riskiest pregnancies and determining
appropriate intervention strategies for the current pregnancy,
subsequent interconceptual care, and maternal and child
health are paramount.
