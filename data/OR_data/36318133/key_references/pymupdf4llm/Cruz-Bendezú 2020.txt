Abstract

Background: Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are reported as unintended and rates are highest
among women of low socioeconomic status. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between
unintended pregnancies and maternal mental health and timing of prenatal care among low-income women.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 870 women, whom were participating in the First 1000 Days program in
three community health centers in the Boston area, were enrolled at their first prenatal visit from August 2016 –
September 2017. We assessed pregnancy intention by self-report using the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring
System. We used self-reported survey information and electronic health record data to assess the following
outcomes: current stress, current depression, and timing of initial prenatal visit. We used multivariable logistic
regression models to examine associations and adjusted for sociodemographic factors.

Results: Women were a mean (SD) age of 29.3 (6.1), and 39.2% reported that their pregnancy was unintended.
50.6% of women were Hispanic, 28.4% were White, 10.1% were Black, and 10.9% were other races. 78.9% of women
reported an annual household income <$50,000. Overall, 26.7% of women reported current stress, 8.2% reported
current depression, and 18.3% of women initiated prenatal care after their first trimester. In multivariable analyses,
women with unintended pregnancies had higher odds of experiencing current stress (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.41),
current depression (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.04, 3.20), and initiation of prenatal care post-first trimester (OR: 1.84; 95% CI:
1.23, 2.74).

Conclusions: Unintended pregnancies were associated with current stress and depression, and delayed prenatal
care in this sample of low-income women suggesting the importance of identifying high-risk women and tailoring
interventions to support women’s needs.

Background
Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are
reported as unintended, defined as unwanted and mistimed pregnancies [1]. Rates of unintended pregnancies
are highest among women of low socioeconomic status,
as well as among racial and ethnic minorities [2, 3]. Unintended pregnancies are a major public health concern
in the United States due to the high incidence and impact on maternal and child health. Unintended pregnancies have been found to be associated with deleterious
maternal health behaviors and outcomes, such as inconsistent folic acid consumption, smoking, alcohol intake

[4–6]; and poor infant outcomes, such as shortened
birth length, low birth weight, and reduced likelihood of
breastfeeding [7–10].
In addition, maternal psychosocial outcomes, including
stress and depression, and delayed prenatal care have
been associated with unintended pregnancies, although
few studies examining stress and depression have been
conducted during the prenatal period [11]. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Abajobir and colleagues
found a statistically significant association between unintended pregnancies and antenatal and postpartum depression [11]. Less studied than maternal depression,
stress has also been found to be associated with unintended pregnancies [12]; although results from other
studies reveal mixed findings [11]. Dibaba and colleagues
conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis and
found that women with unintended pregnancies had
greater odds of delaying prenatal care as compared to
women with intended pregnancies [13]. Depression,
stress, and delayed prenatal care can impact maternal
and child health, yet despite the high rates of unintended
pregnancies among women of low socioeconomic status,
few studies or reviews have further examined these outcomes in a low-income population [14].
A more detailed understanding of these outcomes in a
low-income population would allow for improved identification of women at high risk for poor outcomes and
the development of tailored approaches to prenatal care.
The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine maternal mental health and prenatal care as correlates of unintended pregnancies among low-income
women enrolled in the First 1000 Days program in the
Greater Boston area. We hypothesized that women who
reported having an unintended pregnancy would be
more likely to report adverse mental health status and
would be more likely to initiate prenatal care after their
first trimester compared to women with intended
pregnancies.

Methods
The First 1000 Days program is a systems-level initiative
that engages stakeholders across clinical and public


health sectors to reduce the prevalence of obesity and
obesity risk factors among low-income mother-infant
pairs by addressing the various levels of individual, family,
and socio-contextual factors that impact obesity prevention [15]. We implemented the First 1000 Days program
at three community health centers in the Greater Boston,
MA area, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Revere
HealthCare Center, MGH Chelsea HealthCare Center and
DotHouse Health, whose populations are primarily composed of low-income, racial/ethnic minority, primarily
publicly insured, and foreign-born patients. Pregnant
women enrolled in the First 1000 Days program if they received their obstetrics care at one of the three health centers and completed the program’s intake survey on an
iPad or paper at their initial nurse prenatal visit, which
was available in English, Vietnamese, Spanish and Arabic.
The initial prenatal intake survey was offered to all women
who initiated prenatal care at the three health centers between August 2016 and September 2017. At the initial
prenatal intake visits, women had the option to complete
the intake screener or decline participation. A small proportion of women who were not offered the intake
screener by the clinical staff at the time of their appointment or were not able to complete the intake survey by
paper were later contacted by phone and given the option
to complete the intake screener and enroll in the program.
For women who completed multiple intake surveys during
the study period (e.g. women with an early pregnancy loss
and a subsequent pregnancy), only the first intake survey
was used. The study protocol was approved by the Partners Healthcare institutional review board and registered
[at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03191591).](http://clinicaltrials.gov)

Pregnancy intention
The main exposure for this study, which was a secondary analysis, was pregnancy intention, assessed through
the initial prenatal intake survey. We asked women,
“Thinking back to when you learned you were pregnant,
how did you feel about being pregnant?” Women had a
choice of the following responses: “I wanted to be pregnant sooner”, “I wanted to be pregnant later”, “I wanted
to be pregnant now”, or “I didn’t want to be pregnant
now or at any time in the future”. This survey question
is from the Center for Disease Control’s Pregnancy Risk
Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) [16]. We classified responses into two categories: intended pregnancy
for women responding, “I wanted to be pregnant sooner”
or “I wanted to be pregnant now”, and unintended pregnancy, which included mistimed and unwanted pregnancies, for women responding, “I wanted to be pregnant
later” or “I didn’t want to be pregnant now or at any
time in the future.” This classification has been widely
used across similar studies and analyses [8, 10, 17].

Current stress
To measure current stress, we asked women “How much
stress do you feel in your life?” which was adapted from
the Growing Up Today Study [18]. We defined current
stress as any positive responses including “I feel stress
fairly often”, “I sometimes feel a lot of stress” or “I feel a
lot of stress most of the time”.

Current depression
Current depression was measured using the Patient
Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) [19] or the Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) [20] depending on
the health center. Mothers who completed the initial
prenatal intake survey at DotHouse Health answered the
PHQ-2 questions “Over the past two weeks, how often
have you been bothered by any of the following problems?” and “Over the past two weeks, how often have
you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?” We categorized a score ≥ 3 on the PHQ-2 as current depression

[19]. For those women who completed the prenatal intake survey at the MGH Chelsea and MGH Revere
HealthCare Centers, we obtained an EPDS score from
their electronic health record (EHR) to assess current
depression. We defined an EPDS score ≥ 12 and/or a reported answer other than “never” when asked if “The
thought of harming myself has occurred to me” within
the past 7 days, as current depression [20].

Gestational age at initial prenatal visit
We established when participants began seeking prenatal
care by obtaining gestational age at their initial prenatal
visit from the EHR. The American Academy of
Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists Guidelines for Perinatal Care recommend that women begin their prenatal care within the
first trimester [21, 22], and we defined the start of care
within the first trimester of pregnancy as early initiation
and the start of care any time after the first trimester as
late initiation (after 13 weeks).

Confounding factors
We selected covariates based on the literature and collected information regarding these factors from the prenatal intake survey and the EHR. From the intake
survey, we collected maternal race/ethnicity (White;
Hispanic or Latino; Black; Asian or Other) [1, 2, 17, 23],
annual household income [1–3], marital status, primary
care visit within the past 12 months, and country of origin [2, 7, 24]. From the EHR, we collected age in years

[1, 2, 10], gravidity [2, 10, 24], and health insurance
coverage at the time of survey completion [2, 25].


Data analysis
Participant characteristics were described overall and according to pregnancy intention status. We used χ[2] tests
to compare categorical variables and t-tests to compare
continuous variables by pregnancy intention status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the
odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each of the
three outcome variables: experiencing current stress,
screening positive for current depression, and initiating
prenatal care after the first trimester. Results from all
models were adjusted for confounders chosen a priori
after a review of the literature. For each outcome, the
following series of models were created. Model 1
adjusted for race/ethnicity and maternal age. Model 2
adjusted for all covariates in model 1 plus household income, marital status, and country of birth. Model 3 adjusted for all covariates in model 2 plus gravidity and
insurance status. For analyses, we used Model 3. A 2sided alpha level of 0.05 was used to test for statistical
significance in all analyses. All analyses were performed
using R version 3.4.4 [26].

Missing data
Among the women who completed the maternal intake
screener at their initial prenatal visit, 73.4% had no missing data for pregnancy intention, covariates, and
outcomes. Overall, 3.2% of the dataset was missing in
fully-adjusted models, with missing percentage for individual variables ranging from less than 2% for maternal
age to 12% for depression screening. We excluded
women from the analyses who did not answer the pregnancy intention question (14 participants). In order to
retain all available observations, minimize bias due to
missing information, and improve efficiency in parameter estimation, we used multivariate imputation by
chained equations implemented with the mice package

[27, 28]. We first visualized the missingness patterns for
each variable and decided that the missing at random assumption was reasonable. Next, we specified the imputation model—logistic regression for dichotomous
variables, multinomial logistic regression for categorical
variables, and predictive mean matching for continuous
variables. We included the following variables in the
order listed in the imputation model: health care center
of prenatal care initialization, language, calendar year
and month, household size, public benefits enrollment,
pre-pregnancy body mass index, housing and food insecurity status, age, gravidity, gestational age at initial prenatal visit, race, income, insurance status, marital status,
country of origin, pregnancy intention, current stress,
current depression, and primary care engagement in the
twelve months before initializing prenatal care. Twenty
iterations were used to ensure convergence and 30
multiply imputed data sets were created. The results for


-----

the multivariable logistic regressions were obtained by
combining the separate estimates and standard errors
from each of the 30 imputed datasets.

Results
Eight hundred seventy women were included in the final
statistical analyses. Women were a mean (SD) age of
29.3 (6.1) years, and 39.2% reported that their pregnancy
was unintended. 50.6% of women were Hispanic, 28.4%
were White, 10.1% were Black, and 10.9% were other
races. 78.9% of women reported an annual household income <$50,000. Overall, in this study, 26.7% of women
reported current stress and 8.2% reported current depression. 18.3% of women initiated care after their first
trimester. For the women reporting unintended pregnancy, 57.4% identified as Hispanic or Latino, had a
mean (SD) age of 27.7 (6.5) years, and over 80% made
<$50,000 a year. 32.2% of women reporting unintended
pregnancy had a marital status of “other”, 78.8% had
public insurance, and 38.5% did not have a primary care
visit within the last 12 months. Women reporting unintended pregnancy were younger, not married, more
likely to have public insurance, and less likely to have
attended a primacry care visit as compared to women
reporting intended pregnancy. Furthermore, 34.4% reported current stress, 12% reported current depressive
symptoms, and 24.7% had initiated care after the first
trimester. Whereas, women whom reported an intended
pregnancy, 21.7% had current stress, 5.81% had current
depression, and 14.2% had initiated care after the first
trimester. Table 1 presents the maternal characteristics
and bivariate associations by the overall study sample
and pregnancy intention.
In unadjusted models (Table 2), we found that women
with unintended pregnancies had higher odds of experiencing current stress (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.40, 2.59),
current depressive symptoms (OR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.24,
3.51), and initiating prenatal care after the first trimester
(OR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.36, 2.74) compared to women with
intended pregnancies.
In the fully adjusted multivariable models adjusting
for race/ethnicity, maternal age, household income,
marital status, country of birth, gravidity, and insurance status, the associations persisted albeit mildly
attenuated between the main exposure, pregnancy
intention and the psychosocial outcomes (Table 2).
As compared to women with intended pregnancies,
women with unintended pregnancies had higher odds
of experiencing current stress (OR: 1.72; 95% CI:
1.22, 2.41) and current depressive symptoms (OR:
1.83; 95% CI: 1.04, 3.20); and they had higher odds of
initiating prenatal care after the first trimester (OR:
1.84; 95% CI: 1.23, 2.74).


Discussion
In this study of 870 low-income women seeking prenatal
care, we found that close to 40% reported an unintended
pregnancy. We found that women with unintended
pregnancies had higher odds of experiencing current
stress and depression; and initiating prenatal care after
the first trimester as compared to women with intended
pregnancies. The findings were robust when adjusted for
sociodemographic factors that might confound the associations between pregnancy intention and our outcomes.
Understanding these relationships can aid in improved
methods for the identification of women whom may be
at risk for stress, depression, and delayed prenatal care.
By studying women of low socioeconomic status, who
are known to have high rates of unintended pregnancies

[2, 3], we can tailor interventions during pregnancy to
address mental health and timely prenatal care, as well
as other known barriers that will help improve maternal
and child health outcomes.
Our study found an association between unintended
pregnancies and current stress and depression; similarly,
other studies have found an association between pregnancy intention and prenatal depression and stress.
These studies assessed depression and stress around the
time of delivery, and when compared to our study participants, participants were predominately high-income
and less racially and ethnically diverse [12, 29]. A study
by Maxson & Miranda [30], which also found an association between pregnancy intentions and depression and
stress, sampled low-income women and completed assessments between 18 and 28 weeks gestation, which
was slightly later than the collection time period for our
study. The strength of association in our study was
found to be stronger than in the Maxson & Miranda
study, which may be explained by the differing collection
time periods during pregnancy or the collection dates.
Our data were collected between 2017 and 2018,
whereas their data were collected between 2005 and
2010, which may indicate stress and depression is becoming an increasing concern for women with unintended pregnancies.
We also found an association between unintended
pregnancies and timing of initiating prenatal care. Our
finding replicates what has been previously found in the
literature [8, 23], and extends the findings to women
whom are low-income and racial and ethnic minorities,
which few studies have examined. Orr and colleagues
found that women whom were black and living in an
urban area with unintended pregnancies were more
likely to initiate prenatal care in their third trimester

[14]. In our study population, which was compromised
of women whom approximately 50% were Hispanic and
approximately 79% earned less than $50,000 per year, we
found women with unintended pregnancies also delayed

In this cross-sectional, secondary analysis, we did not
assess women’s stress, depression, or other life


circumstances prior to conception or during the postnatal period or their attitudes towards the pregnancy. Studies suggest that the relationship between pregnancy
intention and stress and depression is bidirectional [31,
32]. Some women might have been experiencing stress
and depression prior to conceiving which may then have

exacerbated symptoms during pregnancy. Women may
experience differing emotions when they recognize they
are pregnancy; the evidence suggests that unintended
pregnancies that women view as more “acceptable” have
stronger correlations to positive maternal and child
health outcomes [33, 34]. For women living in lowincome communities, structural and institutional factors
play a critical role in accessing healthcare during
women’s reproductive years impacting pregnancy intentions [35, 36]. In our study, 30.8% of women had not received primary care within a year before initiating
prenatal care. The lack of access and engagement may
perpetuate feelings of stress and depression and influence when prenatal care is initiated [34]. Massachusetts
has had universal health coverage since 2006 and a majority of women in our study were insured, thereby suggesting other factors besides lack of insurance coverage
impacted women’s primary care engagement and timing
of prenatal care.
Our study presents with several limitations. As previously discussed, our study was cross-sectional and we
were not able to draw conclusions about the causality of
the associations and what variables (i.e., stress or depression) may have preceded the pregnancy. We used questionnaires that were administered during pregnancy and
have been widely used for measuring pregnancy intentions and maternal psychosocial status. We did not,
though, measure women’s attitudes towards their unexpected pregnancies. In addition, our study population
does not include women with unintended pregnancies
who may have either miscarried, terminated their pregnancy before initiating prenatal care, or never sought
prenatal care. We acknowledge the importance of these
topics and the ongoing discussions in the field on how
to best measure pregnancy intention and reproductive
autonomy [34, 37], but the data examined in this study
still provides important information about pregnancy intentions in specific populations.

Conclusions
We found that approximately 40% of women in this
study whom were predominately low-income reported
an unintended pregnancy. Women with unintended


pregnancies had higher odds of experiencing current
stress and current depression and were also found to
delay their initial prenatal care until after their first trimester. These findings demonstrate the importance of
identifying women whom may be at high risk of adverse
consequences and ensuring interventions during the prenatal time period appropriately support women in addressing stress, depression, and accessing timely prenatal
care.
