Abstract

Background: To investigate the prevalence, socio-cultural and psychosocial risk factors for perinatal depression in Singaporean
women.
Method: A prospective cohort of 559 women was interviewed antenatally and at six weeks’ postpartum at a tertiary hospital.
Women were interviewed for diagnosis of depression using a two-stage design, with a screening questionnaire and diagnostic
interview.
Results: Postnatally, a negative confinement experience was associated with depression. Other independent factors included
poor emotional support, a past history of depression, unplanned pregnancy and perceived potential conflicts with relatives over
childcare antenatally and dissatisfaction, poor instrumental support postnatally. The prevalence of depression antenatally and
postnatally was 12.2% and 6.8%, respectively.
Limitations: Measures of satisfaction with social support were based on self-report; there were high dropout rates at six weeks’
postpartum; and other modulating social factors such as pre-existing interpersonal conflicts were not studied.
Conclusions: Perinatal depression in Singaporean women is common. Contrary to expectations, a negative dconfinementT
experience is a significant risk factor for postnatal depression, and is not universally welcomed by women. Depression is
modulated by dissimilar sets of psychosocial factors antenatally and postnatally.

1. Introduction

Psychosocial factors play a large part in depression
(Brown et al., 1996), perhaps even more so during the
perinatal period than at any other time in a woman’s
life. Perinatal depression, defined here as depression
encompassing pregnancy and the first postpartum
year, has potentially profound negative effects on
mother and child (Murray and Cooper, 1997). Pillsbury (1978) has pointed towards the protective effects
of close social networks and forms of culturally
sanctioned social support such as the ritual of
confinement or bdoing the monthQ in some Asian
cultures, though recent studies have highlighted that
ethnoepidemiological factors must also be considered
(Lee et al., 2004). Singapore is a small South-East
Asian island–nation that presents the opportunity to
study a population with easy geographical access to
extended family, as well as to traditional social
support through confinement practices.
In particular, we were interested to study the
confinement experience and its relation to perinatal
depression. Singapore is a melting-pot of South-East
Asian cultures and influences. It has a predominantly
ethnic Chinese population with significant Malay and
Indian minorities. The majority of Chinese and
Indians of childbearing age are third- or fourthgeneration Singaporeans whose ancestors migrated
from Southern China and Southern India respectively.
The Malay population is indigenous and shares the
same culture as their counterparts in Peninsular
Malaysia and part of the Riau islands of Indonesia.
In this study, we defined bconfinementQ to encompass not only the Chinese traditional practice also
known as peiyue, but also the local Malay and Indian
traditions which are intended to increase social
support for the mother and to aid her recovery from
childbirth. Chinese confinement traditions dictate that
the mother is in a state of depletion and needs
bwarmingQ tonics and food to redress this imbalance.
Special dietary prescriptions and proscriptions may
include food that is cooked with ginger, and avoiding
bcoolingQ things such as cold water or drinks. For
some women, confinement practices may even include bathing in warm water to which certain herbs
have been added or not washing one’s hair for the
entire month! In addition to or other than having a
female relative help with infant care, some Chinese


women may hire a bconfinement nannyQ for the
express purpose of cooking the requisite postnatal
diet and looking after the physical needs of the baby.
There is booming cottage industry of middle-aged
Chinese women with practical experience in peiyue
who have successful careers staying with families a
month at a time to care for them. Anecdotally, there
have been reports of clashes between confinement
caregivers and the new mother over issues such as,
say, whether or not to breastfeed the child in which
both parties may come with different sets of cultural
beliefs and expectations.
In addition for the woman to not leave the house
for the first forty days postpartum or so, it is
common for Malay women to hire a masseuse who
provides postnatal massage, apply traditional herbs
and perform abdominal binding designed to aid
involution of the uterus and return to the mother’s
prenatal weight and figure. Indian Hindu women are
likely to have certain dietary restrictions during the
postnatal period, together with having special prayers
and ceremonies designed to protect mother and child
from spiritual harm. Owing to the assimilation of
such practices across cultures, various elements of
these confinement practices have been adopted
across the different ethnic groups to varying degrees.
For example, it is not uncommon for Chinese or
Indian women to hire a Malay masseuse who will
come to the house during the confinement month to
do the postnatal massage and abdominal binding
during the first few weeks post-delivery. We thus
sought to study the socio-cultural factors associated
with and prevalence of perinatal depressive disorders
in Singaporean women.

2. Method

The study design was of a longitudinal cohort study
of women delivering at a university-affiliated teaching
hospital in Singapore between July 2002 to December
2003. Inclusion criteria included all pregnant women
who were available for the 6-week follow-up period
after delivery. Potential subjects were approached
during their antenatal appointments in the obstetric
clinic and written informed consent was first obtained
from potential subjects prior to recruitment. Women
who were subsequently diagnosed as having a

clinically significant disorder were offered access to
counselling or psychiatric services. The study was
approved by the local institutional review board.
The study had a two-stage design consisting of a
screening questionnaire followed by a diagnostic
interview for mood disorders. This was done at both
initial and follow-up visits. All women received a
detailed questionnaire that included the well-validated
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (Cox
et al., 1987). Following a pilot study in which the
EPDS was validated in all women, those scoring
above a cut-off value of 7 on the EPDS were
subsequently interviewed by one of the authors
(C.Y.I.C) trained in the use of the mood disorder
modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM-IV, non-patient version (SCID-IV) (First et al.,
1994). A Mandarin-version EPDS was adapted from
the Hong Kong Chinese version of the EPDS (Lee et
al., 1998) for Chinese-speaking patients. However, the
original English-language version of the EPDS was
used instead as the vast majority of respondents
preferred to be interviewed in English. The six-week
postnatal visit consisted of a brief questionnaire, the
EPDS, and the SCID-IV for screen-positive women. If
the women did not turn up for their six-week postnatal
visits, self-addressed survey forms were mailed to
them in addition to telephone reminders if they did not
reply within a week.
The mood disorders that were studied in this
sample included that of major depressive disorder
(MDD) by DSM-IV criteria (American Psychiatric
Association, 1994), and minor depressive disorder if
their symptoms did not reach five out of the nine
criteria specified for MDD. Given that many women
had somatic symptoms that were attributable to the
perinatal state rather than depression, care was taken
to ensure that the symptoms enquired about were
distinct from the former. If any doubt existed as to the
cause of the symptoms, then we erred on the side of
conservatism and it was scored as negative.
We examined the risk factors that were commonly
reported in previous studies of postnatal depression.
These included:

(a) Demographic and socio-economic factors such
as age; marital status; the number, age and
gender of other children; educational level;
employment status; household income, and


whether the woman was living with her
extended family or not;
(b) Medical history and past psychiatric history of
depression; obstetric history including previous
miscarriage or abortion;
(c) Interpersonal relationships such as marital and
sexual satisfaction; ratings of emotional and
practical support (also known as instrumental
support) by various family members, and
perceived potential conflicts with other family
members over childcare;
(d) Socio-cultural factors such as details of specific
confinement practices and the subjects’ views
on whether or not they found them helpful.

Marital satisfaction was based on a self-reported
item on the questionnaire using a five-point Likert
scale. Social support was conceptualised as pertaining
to emotional support and practical support domains.
Respondents rated various specific family members
including one’s partner, the infant’s grandparents, a
domestic helper if any, and other relatives such as
siblings, according to the amount of the two types of
support they could count on, based on a five-point
Likert scale ranging from bhardly everQ to b usuallyQ.
These were assigned raw values ranging from 1 to 5,
yielding a total score of between 5 and 35 for each of
the emotional and practical support sub-scores and
between 10 and 70 on the overall support score, with
70 being the maximum amount of social support
scored. Inclusion of a domestic helper into the social
support network was deemed important within the
Singaporean context, as a substantial number of
families employ a live-in foreign domestic helper to
aid in childcare and housework. At six weeks’
postpartum, additional questions were asked pertaining to the degree of satisfaction with the confinement
experience if any, whether the woman was still
breastfeeding or not, and how many times they had
brought their infants to the doctor on non-routine
visits (that is, other than for immunizations or wellbaby visits) over the past six weeks.
We estimated that a sample size of 500 would give
a 95% confidence estimate of DSM-IV major depressive disorder at 10% prevalence with a 2.5% point
precision. The Obstetrics and Gynaecology department of the National University Hospital of Singapore
oversees approximately 2500 deliveries per year.

2.1. Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was done using the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences Version 12.0 (SPSS
v12.0 for Windows XP). Univariate analysis for the
various independent variables that might be associated
with perinatal mood disorders was performed using
the independent Student’s t-test for continuous variables and chi-square tests for dichotomous and
categorical variables. Logistic regression analysis
was used to estimate the univariate odds ratios and
their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to explore the
important independent associations between variables
and mood disorders after adjustment for confounders.

3. Results

During the first phase of the study when 724
mothers were approached antenatally for recruitment
into the study, 128 (17.7%) declined to participate in

the study and 37 (5.1%) were excluded because they
would not be available during the follow-up period.
The remaining 559 (77.2%) patients were recruited
into the study. Limited information about the refusals
was obtained from their patient registration data.
However, comparison of baseline data between
refusals and subjects showed that the two groups
appeared to be comparable in terms of age and ethnic
group. During the second phase of the study, 278
mothers gave follow-up interviews at six weeks’
postpartum. Of the dropouts, 279 either declined
follow-up or were un-contactable, one mother had had
a stillbirth and one mother had died from medical
complications of pregnancy. Patients who dropped out
did not differ significantly from patients who were
available for six-week follow-up in all the studied
variables except for ethnic group and mean EPDS
scores (Table 1), with follow-up patients having lower
EPDS scores than dropouts.

ethnic groups. 556 (99.5%) of the women were
married at the time of recruitment into the study, with
510 (91.2%) having completed secondary school
education and above. 224 (40.4%) of the sample
were university graduates, reflecting a relatively high
level of education compared with the general population. 342 (61.8%) were either working full-time
(56.9%) or part-time (4.9%), with the remaining either
stay-at-home mothers or unemployed. 405 (72.5%)
women were living with their partners without any
extended family members in the same household.


3.1. Prevalence of depressive disorders and associated factors

Antenatally, 68 (12.2%) women were diagnosed as
having a clinically significant mood disorder, of
which 24 (4.3%) women were diagnosed with major
depressive disorder and 44 (7.9%) as having minor
depressive disorder. The rate of depressive disorders
fell to 6.8% at six weeks postpartum, with the
percentage of mothers diagnosed with MDD remaining the same at 4.3% (Table 2). Significant factors on
univariate analysis associated with depression in
antenatal women are tabulated in Table 3, together
with the results for the stepwise logistic regression
modelling. Four factors that were statistically significant included an unplanned pregnancy, poor emotional support, a past history of depression and
anticipating potential conflicts with family members
over childcare. Postnatally, logistic regression analysis
with adjustment for confounding showed that the
presence of depressive disorder was independently

associated with a negative confinement experience, a
past history of depression, low instrumental support
and marital dissatisfaction (Table 4).

3.2. Confinement experiences and depressive disorders

We found that while having a negative confinement experience was associated with the risk of
having a depressive disorder (Table 4). Antenatally,
78% of the respondents indicated that they were
intending to undergo confinement, with 79.2% of
respondents reporting that they had done so at the
postnatal follow-up. 61.9% expected their confinement to be a positive experience when interviewed


antenatally, and 67.2% of those who eventually
underwent confinement reported that they had found
it a positive experience, with the rest replying bnot
sureQ or bnoQ. The majority of women described the
confinement experience to include practices such as
not leaving the house for the first few weeks’
postpartum (69.4%), eating certain foods (66.9%),
avoiding certain foods (58.6%) and having postnatal
massage (52.2%). Only one in three women reported
that the confinement experience included having
someone help with looking after the newborn during
the day (31.8%) or the night (29.0%). 18% indicated
that their mothers-in-law would be the main caregivers during their confinement; however there was

(v[2] =1.691, p =0.193).

4. Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to show
that confinement practices can be a risk factor for
postnatal depression, a form of culturally sanctioned
support which is widely practiced in South-East Asia
among the Chinese, Malay and Indian populations.
Furthermore, a third of women surveyed did not
consider confinement a positive experience. In our
sample, a positive confinement experience was also
not associated with a lower risk of developing a
depressive disorder in our study population. One
possible explanation of this finding is that the study
was insufficiently powered to detect a significant
association between a positive confinement experience as a protective factor against depression.
Another explanation is of course that a positive
confinement experience in itself is not enough to
ameliorate depression and that there are many
complex inter-related variables involved. Our interpretation of the data is that confinement per se
should no longer be counted upon to be a factor that
might lessen or delay the onset of depressive
disorder (Pillsbury, 1978) and that a negative
confinement experience might actually contribute
towards a new mother’s distress. Our survey of
confinement practices that mothers reported also
indicates that instrumental support such as having a
family member or bconfinement ladyQ looking after
the baby during the day and/or night occurred in
only a third of mothers. Thus though the more
common elements of the confinement experience
would include dietary proscriptions and prescriptions
as well as restrictions on a woman leaving the home,
actual instrumental support was only provided in a
minority of mothers. The heterogeneity and quality
of the confinement experience are thus an important
factor to take into account when considering its
effects on the woman’s postpartum experience.
A study on Chinese women who had migrated to
Sydney, Australia also found that 18% of the subjects
felt ambivalent about their confinement, with the
impression that their adherence to such practices were


more a result of family or in-law expectations than
their own wishes (Matthey et al., 2002). This is likely
to have been the case for the women in our sample as
well, given that 38% were not sure or did not think
that confinement would be helpful even during the
antenatal visit. Future research would be useful in
elucidating the actual specific components of the
confinement experience that are perceived as helpful
and go towards ameliorating or preventing postnatal
depression. A further clinical implication for physicians involved in the care of antenatal women would
be to identify women who do not think confinement
will be a positive experience, and to possibly involve
the family early to reduce the potential stress on the
mother by not insisting that she undergo confinement
practices that are a stressor rather than a source of
emotional and instrumental support for her.
The caregiver during the confinement period was
another variable we looked at. Lee et al (2004) had
earlier pointed towards the possibility of this period
being like a double-edged sword, providing muchneeded practical support on one hand, and being an
additional source of interpersonal conflict, particularly if the mother-in-law was the one responsible for
looking after the woman during the first postpartum
month. Given women in confinement, as the name
implies, are not encouraged to step out of the home
during the first few weeks postpartum, this could
lead to an increased chance of unwanted interpersonal friction with family members, particularly
among women who did not have a good initial
relationship with the relative responsible for helping
out during confinement. We did not detect any
association between the mother-in-law being involved in confinement and depressive disorders as
was suggested in Lee’s ethnoepidemiological study;
however, our study was not sufficiently powered to
detect such associations.
We also did not find any protective effect of having
one’s mother being involved in the confinement
experience, unlike an earlier Taiwanese study (Heh
et al., 2004). However, comparisons between the two
populations are limited due to differences in the two
populations’ characteristics. While a Taiwanese woman might travel back to her parental home for the
confinement period and receive practical support
largely from her parents, a woman in Singapore might
be able to access multiple sources of practical support

owing to geographical proximity to one’s parents,
parents-in-law and the ease of hiring a live-in
domestic helper. This once again highlights the need
to take the social and cultural context into account
when considering the effect of cultural and psychosocial practices on perinatal depression.
It can also be argued that postnatal depression
could also cause a woman to be more likely to
perceive her confinement experience as a negative
one. There may indeed be some women who fall into
this group. However, about four in ten women in the
sample had misgivings about their confinement
experience being a positive one even before they
had delivered, and this would have included women
who were not depressed prior to delivery. While a
negative confinement experience is obviously not the
only factor involved in postnatal depression, it may
very well be the proverbial straw that breaks the
camel’s back in some cases.
In all likelihood, the relationship between the
confinement experience and postnatal depression is
a complex one, the specific pathways of which this
study has picked up but is unable to address
adequately. Future qualitative studies would be
needed to further explore and elucidate the nature of
the relationship between depression and the confinement experience. Ultimately, what is important is that
a woman undergoing a confinement experience
should not be simplistically assumed to enjoy it and
benefit from it, and that it can be a source both of
much-needed support as well as stress.

4.1. Emotional and instrumental support across
delivery

After controlling for various factors, we found a
strong statistical association between the presence of
depressive disorder and emotional support antenatally.
Postnatally, instrumental support became more highly
associated with depressive disorder than emotional
support. This is perhaps not surprising, given the
importance of practical help required in caring for a
newborn infant. Furthermore, poor marital satisfaction
was independently associated with depression at six
weeks’ postpartum. It would thus appear that antenatal
depression and postnatal depression share dissimilar
risk factors with diverse relevance during the antenatal
and postnatal period.


4.2. Prevalence of depression

We found that the prevalence of antenatal depressive disorders in our sample of women was comparable
to that of Western populations (O’Hara and Swain,
1996; Gorman et al., 2004). There was a drop in
prevalence rates of depression after delivery as has
been described in other studies (Evans et al., 2001).
Strikingly, prevalence rates of major depressive disorder remained stable as the declines in prevalence rates
of depressive disorder postnatally were largely due to a
drop-off in minor depressive disorder prevalence rates.

5. Limitations

One limitation of the study was the high dropout
rate during the second phase of the study. This is
perhaps not surprising, given that high rates of
refusals in excess of 50% and dropouts of up to
36% were also seen in other studies of perinatal
women (Morris-Rush et al., 2003). These dropout and
refusal rates may thus reflect a widespread problem in
the perinatal period where there are extra demands
placed on the woman’s time due to preparing for the
arrival and caring for the new infant. Patients who
dropped out of the study also had significantly higher
EPDS scores, suggesting a possibly higher rate of
depression in this group. Another factor to consider in
our study is that we also offered screen-positive
women referrals for counselling and towards appropriate channels of help. It is likely that this would
have resulted in lower rates of perinatal depression
than if no interventions were offered. However, the
take-up rate of women who were depressed and
agreed to be referred to social workers or psychiatrists
for treatment was extremely low. Thus on balance, our
reported rate is unlikely to reflect a positive bias
towards reporting psychological distress.
A further limitation of the study was that although
care was taken to diagnose women who screened as
positive on the EPDS with a diagnostic interview
schedule using the SCID, a small proportion of
women with low EPDS scores (false negatives) may
actually have had clinically diagnosable depressive
disorder. Including these women in the control group
of non-depressed women would thus bias the
estimates of association towards the null.

A note also needs to be made about the clinical
versus statistical significance of a negative confinement experience and its association with postnatal
depression. While statistically significant, the confidence intervals were very large, largely due to the
small absolute numbers of postnatally depressed
women in the six-week postnatal sample. Given that
the prevalence of depression is likely to be underestimated in the follow-up sample, we think that
this association is still likely to be clinically
significant.
Other possible factors that might modulate psychosocial support were also not addressed in this
study. For example, although the majority of women
lived in nuclear family units in their own households, governmental policies encouraging young
couples to live within a kilometre of their parents
and good transport links mean that the woman’s
parents or parents-in-law could be living in close
proximity and are able to provide reliable practical
support for the new parents. Also, pre-existing
interpersonal conflicts were not assessed in this
study as well.

6. Conclusions

Perinatal depression in Singaporean women is
common, though it appears that antenatal and
postnatal depression are modulated by dissimilar sets
of psychosocial factors. Some of these factors are
well known, such as poor marital satisfaction,
unplanned pregnancy and a past history of depression. Clinicians should thus be alert to enquiring
about women’s emotional as well as instrumental
support during the perinatal period, bearing in mind
that different aspects of such support may emerge as
differentially important depending on the time-point
the woman is seen at.
Contrary to expectations, we also found that a
negative confinement experience actually increases
the risk of postnatal depression. The nature of the
confinement experience is complex and heterogenous, possibly involving factors that can increase
postnatal depression by increasing unwelcome interpersonal contact or are perceived as an obligation or
series of restrictions which the mother does not find
helpful. It should certainly no longer be taken at


face value as a uniformly helpful practice. Future
research could elucidate which particular aspects of
the confinement experience are helpful, rather than
contributing towards depressive disorder, and to
study interventions that could tip the balance in
favour of the mother’s psychiatric and emotional
well-being.

6.1. 3 clinical implications

1. A negative confinement experience is associated
with depression at six weeks’ postpartum;
2. Culturally mandated social support is a complex
phenomenon which cannot be assumed to be
always helpful to the mother;
3. Prevalence rates of depression drop after delivery,
mainly accounted for by a reduction in the
prevalence of minor depressive disorder.

6.2. 3 limitations

1. High dropout rates at 6 weeks’ postnatal follow-up;
2. Only self-report measures of psychosocial support
and marital satisfaction were obtained;
3. Other possible factors that might modulate psychosocial support such as proximity to extended
family and pre-existing interpersonal conflicts were
not assessed.
