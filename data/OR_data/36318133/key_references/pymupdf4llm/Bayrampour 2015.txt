Introduction


#### a b s t r a c t

Purpose: chronic poor mental health over the course of pregnancy contributes to greater adverse
maternal and child outcomes. Identifying women with chronic depressive or anxiety symptoms can
provide opportunities to reduce distress and improve pregnancy outcomes. The objective of this study
was to determine risk factors of chronic antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms using a longitudinal
pregnancy cohort in Alberta, Canada.
Methods: women with singleton pregnancies were included (N¼ 3021). Anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured in the second and third trimesters using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety
Inventory and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, respectively. On the basis of the timing and
persistence of symptoms, the following three mutually exclusive subgroups for each anxiety and
depressive symptoms were created: never symptomatic, symptomatic only in the second trimester,
and symptomatic at both time points. Separate logistic regression models were used to derive risk factors
for each subgroup.
Findings: women with chronic anxiety or depressive symptoms were distinguished from those with
transient symptoms or no symptoms by their optimism scores, in which less optimistic pregnant women
had a four-fold increased risk for developing chronic depressive or anxiety symptoms compared with
more optimistic women (AOR varied from 4.30 to 4.93). Additionally, high perceived stress, low social
support, history of mental health issues were common predictors of chronic anxiety and depressive
symptoms in pregnancy. Partner tension was the exclusive predictor of anxiety symptoms (AOR varied
from 1.94 to 2.31) and poor physical health (AOR 2.54; 95% CI 1.32–4.89), unplanned pregnancy (AOR
3.05; 95% CI 1.61–5.79), and infertility treatments (AOR 4.98; 95% CI 1.85–13.39) were unique predictors
of chronic depressive symptoms.
Conclusions: knowledge of the risk factors of chronic poor mental health during pregnancy might inform
the development of effective strategies within the limited resources of health-care systems to target
populations with greater needs for interventions.

Anxiety and depressive symptoms are common during pregnancy. Up to one-third of women may experience anxiety symptoms during pregnancy (Lee et al., 2007). The prevalence of
depression varies from 7.4% in the first trimester, to 12.8% in the
second semester, and 12.0% in the third trimester (Bennett et al.,

2004). The literature suggests that anxiety and depressive symptoms are not static across the perinatal period (Sutter-Dallay et al.,
2012; Mora et al., 2009; Kuo et al., 2014) and symptoms for some
women may be transitional and resolve over time, whereas these
symptoms can persist in other women (Geller, 2004). Significant
heterogeneity in the timing and persistence of perinatal depression has been reported and three distinct categories of women in
regard to depressive symptoms have been identified: never
symptomatic, chronically symptomatic, and only symptomatic at
the antenatal or postpartum period (Sutter-Dallay et al., 2012;
Mora et al., 2009). Similar evidence on antenatal anxiety
is scarce with the exception of a recent study that reported


-----

trajectories of the severity of anxiety symptoms ranging from very
low to very high among women undergoing caesarean childbirth
(Kuo et al., 2014). The heterogeneity of anxiety symptoms has been
noted in other populations (Nandi et al., 2009).
It is known that depression and anxiety can increase the risk of
adverse pregnancy and child outcomes. The timing and duration of
depressive and anxiety symptoms may be related to severity of
adverse maternal and child health outcomes. For instance, in a
longitudinal study, Chung et al. (2004) found that depressive
symptomatology that persisted through the perinatal period was
related to poor parenting practices (Chung et al., 2004). A link
between antenatal anxiety and preterm birth, low birth weight
(Littleton et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 2009; O'Donnell et al., 2011),
and postpartum depression (Ahluwalia et al., 2004; Heron et al.,
2004; Skouteris et al., 2009) as well as the increased risk of delays
in cognitive, behavioural, and psychomotor development and
mental health problems in children (Buss et al., 2011; Davis and
Sandman, 2012; Kingston et al., 2012; Loomans et al., 2012) has
been reported. Alterations in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal
cortical-axis activity, which is believed to play a role in forming
the pathways of these adverse outcomes, have been shown to be
related to chronic anxiety symptoms (Greaves-Lord et al., 2007).
Roesch et al. (2004) found that pregnancy anxiety experienced at
multiple time points over the course of pregnancy was associated
with shorter gestation (Roesch et al., 2004).
Demographic and psychosocial characteristics of pregnant
women suffering from chronic mental health symptoms might
differ from others. In a study by Mora et al. (2009), chronically
depressed women were more likely to be multiparous and have
moderate or high stress levels compared with other women (Mora
et al., 2009). Evidence on risk factors of chronic mental health
symptoms during the antenatal period is limited. With a few
exceptions, previous studies on risk factors of antenatal depression
and anxiety are cross-sectional with a single assessment of
symptoms and do not address chronicity of symptoms or variations related to pregnancy stages. Knowledge of the risk factors of
chronic antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms can inform
screening strategies to identify the at-risk group of women with a
high need for interventions. This information might also aid in the
development of more refined models of mechanisms and causal
pathways in which poor mental health leads to adverse outcomes.
The aim of the current study was to identify the demographic,
clinical, cognitive, and psychosocial predictors of transient and
chronic depressive and anxiety symptoms in a community sample
of pregnant women.

Materials and methods

Data for this study were obtained from the All Our Babies (AOB)
cohort, an established longitudinal pregnancy cohort in Alberta,
Canada, that has prospective questionnaire data on maternal
mental health, health-care utilisation, birth outcomes, and postpartum experiences. Recruitment began in 2008 and ended in
2010. Information on recruitment, data collection, and questionnaires for the AOB study has been described in detail elsewhere
(Gracie et al., 2010; McDonald et al., 2013). Data collection
included repeat assessments using validated questionnaires and
investigator/stakeholder questions. Participants completed three
questionnaires, twice during pregnancy ( o25 weeks and 34–36
weeks gestation) and once during the postpartum period (four
months), and provided consent to link to their medical records.
The cohort has been followed annually at 12, 24, and 36 months
post partum. Cohort retention is greater than 80%. The study
was approved by the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board of
the University of Calgary Participants provided informed consent


at the time of recruitment and were provided copies for their
records.

Study variables

Women with singleton pregnancies were included (N¼3021).
Anxiety was defined as scoring above the established cut-off of 40
on the state anxiety subscale of the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety
Inventory (Spielberger and Gorsuch, 1983). The State Anxiety
Inventory consists of 20 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale from
1 (not at all) to 4 (very much so). This scale has been validated
against clinical interviews during both the pregnancy and postpartum period and has been found to have acceptable sensitivity,
specificity, and predictive values to determine cases of anxiety
among a perinatal population (Grant et al., 2008; Meades and
Ayers, 2011). Three mutually exclusive subgroups of anxiety were
created based on the timing and persistence of symptoms: never
symptomatic, symptomatic exclusively in the second trimester
(o24 weeks), and symptomatic at both time points. Chronic
anxiety was defined as persistently high levels of anxiety symptoms during both the second and third trimesters, whereas
transient anxiety was defined as anxiety symptoms exclusively
during the second trimester.
Depression was measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), a 10-item self-report questionnaire. The scale
has high reliability with an internal consistency of .87(Cox et al.,
1987). The EPDS has been validated for use in the antenatal period
(Murray and Cox, 1990). A score greater than or equal to 13 has
been recommended to identify women with symptoms of major
depression (Gaynes et al., 2005). Similar to anxiety, the following
three mutually exclusive subgroups of depression were created:
never symptomatic, symptomatic exclusively in the second trimester (transient depression), and symptomatic at both time points
(chronic depression).
Variables that were considered potential predictors of antenatal depression and anxiety were selected according to the literature and through discussion with perinatal mental health
professionals. Variables were grouped into the following domains:
demographics (maternal age, marital status, education level,
household income level, ethnicity, and time living in Canada),
obstetrical and physical health status (gravidity, parity, prepregnancy BMI, reproductive history, timing of pregnancy, mode
of conception, pre-existing chronic conditions, and physical health
status), psychosocial (history of substance or alcohol abuse, history
of abuse/neglect, history of mental health issues, partner tension,
and social support in pregnancy), optimism as a cognitive variable,
and perceived stress.
Physical health status, social support, and perceived stress
variables were measured in the second trimester. Physical health
status was measured using the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey
(SF-12v2), a shorter version of the SF-36v2 that covers the same
eight health domains. This scale evaluates functional health and
well-being from the patient's perspective and has two components: physical health (PCS) and mental health (MCS) functioning
(Ware et al., 1996). The SF-12v2 has satisfactory validity and
reliability, with Cronbach's alphas of .88 for the physical component summary and .82 for the mental component summary
(Cheak-Zamora et al., 2009). In the present study, a score below
the 20th percentile on the SF-12v2 physical component summary
was defined as a poor health status during pregnancy.
The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Scale is a
19-item self-report scale that measures four dimensions of social
support: emotional/informational, tangible, affectionate, and positive social interaction (Sherbourne and Stewart, 1991). For each
item, participants are asked to indicate how often each type of
support was available to them if needed by choosing one of five


-----

options. Scores for each item vary from 1 to 5, and the possible
total score ranges from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a greater
perceived social support. The internal consistency of the overall
support scale and all subscales is high, ranging from .91 to .97.
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a ten-item scale that assesses
the degree to which individuals perceive situations in their lives to
be stressful. Participants are asked to rate how often they have felt
or thought a certain way with response choices ranging from
never to very often. The total score is determined by summing all
items and ranges from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating more
perceived stress. The scale has good internal consistency, with a
Cronbach's alpha of .85 (Cohen et al., 1983).
Dispositional optimism was measured by the Life-Orientation
Test-Revised, a 10-item self-report scale. Each item is scored from
0 to 4 based on the respondent's level of agreement with the item.
Given that 4 of these10 items are fillers and are therefore not used
to derive a score, the total score ranges from 0 to 24. Higher scores
indicate greater levels of optimism (Scheier et al., 1994).
A past history of mental health problems was defined as any
self-reported depressive episode for greater than two weeks or
other mental disorders, such as generalised anxiety disorder,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Information on pre-existing medical conditions was obtained
from the medical records. All remaining variables were assessed
using single-item questions or combinations of single item survey
questions.

Analysis

Descriptive statistics using frequencies and percentages were
used to describe sample characteristics. χ[2] analysis was used to
assess bivariate associations between each category of depression
and anxiety and demographic, obstetrical, cognitive, and psychosocial variables. Four separate logistic regression models were
performed to derive risk factor profiles for transient anxiety,
transient depression, chronic anxiety, and chronic depression.
A hierarchal model building strategy was adopted with blocks of
variables entered in the following order: demographic, obstetrical,
psychosocial, cognitive, and perceived stress. Variables from each
domain were considered for inclusion in the multivariable regression models if they had significant bivariate association at p¼.20
or if the variables were deemed clinically important regardless of
statistical significance. Further model building involved checking
the independent effects of those factors previously removed from
each block to ensure robustness of the final models. Although our
outcome variables included three categories, we did not perform
multinomial regression analysis because separate regression analyses allowed for building specific models for each subgroup.
Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were presented
for all final models, and an alpha level of .05 was used for
statistical tests. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS
statistical software program, version 19.0 (IBM Corp, 2010).

Findings

The majority of participants were between 25 and 34 years of
age, married, Caucasian and were born in Canada or had lived in
Canada for more than five years. Most participants had more than
a high school education and reported an annual household income
of at least $80,000 Canadian dollars (Table 1). These characteristics
align with the pregnant and parenting population of an urban
centre in Canada (McDonald et al., 2013). In total, 23% of women
experienced anxiety on at least one occasion during pregnancy,
whereas 11% of women reported depressive symptoms Similarly


the occurrence of transient and chronic anxiety symptoms was
higher than depression (Table 2).
Bivariate analysis revealed that transient anxiety was associated with younger maternal age (o25) (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.54–
3.71), household income o$40,000 (OR 2.29; 95% CI 1.60–3.26),
household income of $40,000–$79,999 (OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.14–1.84),
non-Caucasian ethnicity (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.22–1.95), new immigrants (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.30–2.56), unplanned pregnancy (OR 1.87;
95% CI 1.50–2.34), poor physical health status (OR 1.99; 95% CI
1.57–2.51), history of abuse/neglect (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.55–2.36),
history of substance abuse (OR 1.76; 95% CI 1.08–2.86), partner
tension (OR 2.72; 95% CI 2.21–3.36), history of mental health
issues (OR 2.32; 95% CI 1.90–2.84), low social support (OR 3.48;
95% CI 2.64–4.59), being less-optimistic (OR 4.60; 95% CI 3.61–
5.87), and high perceived stress (OR 6.65; 95% CI 5.23–8.47). With
the exception of being a new immigrant and having a history of
substance abuse, similar factors were associated with chronic
anxiety symptoms. The final multivariable regression models for
transient and chronic anxiety are presented in Tables 3 and 4. High
perceived stress, low social support, history of mental health
issues, partner tension, and being less optimistic were predictors
of chronic anxiety in pregnancy.
Transient depressive symptoms were associated with younger
maternal age (o 25) (OR 3.19; 95% CI 1.59–6.38), household
income o$40,000 (OR 5.35 95% CI 3.35–8.55), household income
of $40,000–$79,999 (OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.40–3.21), non-Caucasian
ethnicity (OR 2.51; 95% CI 1.74–3.62), new immigrants (OR 2.07;
95% CI 1.30–3.40), unplanned pregnancy (OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.21–
2.59), infertility treatments (OR 3.40; 95% CI 4.07–10.79), poor
physical health status (OR 2.08; 95% CI 1.42–3.06), history of
substance abuse (OR 3.30; 95% CI 1.70–6.40), partner tension
(OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.67–3.42), history of mental health issues (OR
3.73; 95% CI 2.60–5.34), low social support in pregnancy (OR 6.44;
95% CI 4.49–9.33), being less optimistic (OR 4.03; 95% CI 2.77–
5.86), and high perceived stress (OR 34.43; 95% CI 21.29–55.69) at
the bivariate level. In addition to these factors, poor reproductive
history and pre-existing chronic conditions were associated with
chronic depressive symptoms throughout pregnancy. The final
multivariable regression models for transient and chronic depressive symptoms are presented in Tables 5 and 6. Predictors of
chronic depressive symptoms in the final model included high
perceived stress, low social support, history of mental health
issues, poor physical health status, unplanned pregnancy, infertility treatment, and being less optimistic.
On the basis of final models, women with chronic symptoms
were distinguished from those with transient symptoms by their
optimism scores in which less optimistic pregnant women had a
four-fold increased risk for developing chronic depressive or
anxiety symptoms compared with more optimistic women (AOR
varied from 4.30 to 4.93). Partner tension was the exclusive
predictor of anxiety symptoms (AOR varied from 1.94 to 2.31).
Poor physical health (AOR 2.54; 95% CI 1.32–4.89), unplanned
pregnancy (AOR 3.05; 95% CI 1.61–5.79), and infertility treatments
(AOR 4.98; 95% CI 1.85–13.39) were unique predictors of chronic
depressive symptoms.

Discussion

The aim of this study was to examine the risk factors of
transient and chronic depressive and anxiety symptomatology in
a community sample of over 3000 pregnant women in Alberta,
Canada. A range of characteristics was independently associated
with membership in each category of symptoms, including demographic, obstetric, cognitive, and psychosocial variables and perceived stress Some of these factors were widely shared across

categories regardless of the continuity of symptoms or stage of
pregnancy. Three common risk factors of transient or chronic
depressive and anxiety symptoms were high perceived stress, low
social support, and a past history of mental health problems. The
impact of these factors on maternal mental health is well-documented; a past history of mental health problems is a major risk
factor for perinatal anxiety and mood disorders (Giardinelli et al.,
2012; Goodman and Tyer-Viola, 2010) and the primary reason for
referral to mental health services during the perinatal period
(Sloan and Kirsh, 2008). Individuals with a history of poor mental
health may have a more heightened response to stressful events
than those without (Post, 1992). In our study, perceived stress was
associated with both transient and chronic anxiety and depression,
with the highest risks related to depression and chronic anxiety
(AOR varied from 17.16 to 24.95). Some common stressors during
pregnancy are low material resources, poor employment conditions, intense family and household responsibilities, tension in
intimate relationships, and complications of pregnancy (Dunkel
Schetter and Tanner, 2012). Low social support can limit the access
and uptake of important resources that enhance resilience to
stress, such as social integration, connectedness, and enacted
support (Dunkel, 2011). A supportive social network can directly
improve overall well-being both by buffering the impact of
potentially adverse effects of stressful life events and by increasing
the ability to cope with these stressors (Cohen and Wills, 1985).
Nearly 90% of our community-based sample of pregnant
women exhibited low depressive symptomology and the majority


-----

of elevated depressive symptoms were transient. Less than 3% of
women experienced chronic depression. Anxiety rates were higher
in all classes, and approximately 9% of women experienced chronic
anxiety. These results call for more attention to antenatal anxiety,
particularly given its adverse impact on pregnancy outcomes.
The factor that distinguished transient symptoms from chronic
conditions for both depressive and anxiety symptoms was dispositional optimism. Pregnant women who were less optimistic
had a four-fold increased risk to develop chronic depressive or
anxiety symptoms compared with optimistic women. Dispositional optimism may directly reduce stress by influencing internal
coping strategies and the cognitive adjustment to diverse stressors. A meta-analysis of 50 studies revealed that dispositional
optimism was positively associated with coping strategies used to
eliminate, reduce, or manage stressors or emotions and negatively
associated with strategies intended to ignore, avoid, or withdraw
from stressors or emotions (Nes and Segerstrom, 2006). In addition, a positive vision of the future can affect a person's perception
of control and indirectly reduce distress. In a study of distress in a
sample of high-risk pregnant women, Lobel et al. (2002) found
that optimistic women were more likely than non-optimistic
women to perceive their pregnancy as controllable and use nonavoidant coping strategies.

Lancaster et al. (2010) conducted a systematic review of 57
studies to identify an overall trend of evidence of risk factors of
depression during pregnancy. Similar to our study, they found that
lack of social support and life stress were consistently related to an
increased risk of depression during pregnancy. The reviewers also
noted that significant bivariate associations between history of
depression, unplanned pregnancy, and lower income exist, but
further research is needed to confirm multivariate relationships
(Lancaster et al., 2010). In our study, unplanned pregnancy and a
history of mental health problems were predictors of chronic
depressive symptoms, but low household income was not.
Two previous studies have examined the risk factors of chronic
depressive symptomology in the perinatal period. In contrast to
our findings, Sutter-Dallay et al. (2012) reported associations
between income and parity and chronic depression. One explanation for this contrasting finding is that their analysis did not
account for perceived stress or psychosocial and cognitive variables. Mora et al. (2009) examined the risk factors of chronic
depression in a prospective cohort study; consistent with our
findings, they noted that high or medium stress is related to
chronic depression. Similar to our study, they did not find
associations between chronic depression and maternal age, marital status, or health behaviours (Mora et al., 2009).
We are not aware of other studies that have examined the risk
factors of chronic anxiety symptoms throughout pregnancy. In a
longitudinal study, Lee et al. (2007) examined anxiety risk factors
at each trimester of pregnancy and noted variations in demographic and obstetric factors, such as age, parity, marital status,
and history of smoking and drinking. Buist et al. (2011) conducted
a cohort study to determine the association between demographic
and psychosocial factors and continuity of generalised anxiety
disorder (GAD) from preconception to pregnancy in four groups of
women: no history of GAD, pre-pregnancy GAD, GAD only during
pregnancy, and GAD during both pre-pregnancy and pregnancy.
They found that women with both pre-pregnancy and pregnancy
anxiety constituted a unique group and were more likely to have
low levels of support and education as well as a history of
childhood abuse (Buist et al., 2011). In our study, low social
support was a predictor of chronic anxiety. We found associations
between chronic anxiety and history of abuse (OR 2.04; 95% CI
1.54–2.70) and education (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.21–2.66) at a bivariate
level; however, these associations did not remain significant in
multivariate analysis


Some variables were more uniquely related to a particular
category of symptoms. For example, demographic variables predicted
only transient depression or anxiety. Physical health status and
obstetrical factors, including unplanned pregnancy, were unique
predictors of chronic depression. Generally, the rates of unplanned
pregnancy are higher among women with a mental health problem
(Takahashi et al., 2012). Women with an unplanned pregnancy also
have an increased risk for discontinuing mental health treatment
after the confirmation of pregnancy compared with women with a
planned pregnancy (Roca et al., 2013). Although not directly examined in our study, it is possible that the combined effects of the
discontinuation of treatment, excessive stress about the influence of
medications on pregnancy, and a fear of symptoms relapse during
pregnancy, labour, or the postpartum period contribute to emotional
distress among women with unplanned pregnancies.
Partner tension was a unique predictor for both transient and
chronic anxiety. A poor quality marital relationship, particularly in
conjunction with other stressors, such as financial difficulties, is a
strong predictor for antenatal anxiety (Nasreen et al., 2011). Although
there is the possibility of a bidirectional association between anxiety
and partnership tension in which elevated anxiety may result in more
relationship conflict, preliminary evidence suggests a unidirectional
association. In a longitudinal study, Whisman et al. (2011) examined
the association between relationship adjustment and symptoms of
anxiety and depression among a sample of pregnant women with a
past history of depression. They reported a unidirectional association
between lower relationship adjustment and higher anxiety levels at
the next assessment (Whisman et al., 2011). However, they found a
bidirectional, recursive association between depression and low
relationship adjustment (Whisman et al., 2011). In our study, bivariate
associations between partner tension and depression emerged but
were not significant in multivariable analysis. Similarly, Lancaster et al.
(2010) found a bivariate trend of association between depression and
poor relationship quality in a review of evidence; however, at the
multivariable level, they did not observe such a relationship.
Despite the substantial sample size and the length of follow-up,
there are a few methodological limitations in this study. Single
mothers constituted a small percentage of the sample; therefore,
the analysis might not have sufficient power to detect the
influence of marital status on mental health. In our sample,
approximately 10% of women with a history of mental health
problems reported taking prescription medications for their mental health condition during pregnancy. Our data, however, did not
include detailed information about the timing, duration, or compliance of the treatment. Although the mean anxiety and depression scores were not significantly different between women taking
medications in our sample and those not taking medications, this
remains a limitation of the study.

Implications

Identifying pregnant women who experience chronic anxiety
or depressive symptoms can help target resources within healthcare systems to serve this high-needs population. The finding with
the clearest clinical importance is that women with lower levels of
optimism are at greater risk for chronic depressive or anxiety
symptoms during pregnancy. If these findings are confirmed with
further research, the inclusion of the measure of optimism in
routine assessments could distinguish women at risk of chronic
symptoms from those with transient symptoms.
Our results also emphasise the importance of understanding
relationship dynamics in the preconception and early pregnancy
periods to address maternal anxiety. Simple interventions, such as
brief cognitive behavioural therapy to improve communications
between partners, might reduce anxiety symptoms. The association between poor physical health status obstetric variables and


-----

chronic depression suggests that women with pregnancy complications should be monitored closely.

Conclusions

Our findings confirm that pregnant women represent a heterogeneous group in terms of the chronicity of anxiety and depressive
symptoms and that some of the characteristics of women with
chronic poor mental health are different from other pregnant
women. These results may inform the development of strategies to
appropriately target limited resources of health-care systems for
populations with chronic poor mental health problems and
greater needs for interventions to improve maternal and child
outcomes related to poor mental health.
