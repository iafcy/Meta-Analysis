**Abstract**
This study set out to fill the research gap by including various aspects of
father involvement and intimate partner violence (IPV) in the examination
of the association between unintended pregnancy and maternal postnatal
depression (PND). This study aimed to examine the effect of father
involvement and IPV on the association between unintended pregnancy and
PND. A sample of 1,083 pregnant women who attended antenatal clinic
at selected hospitals in Hong Kong completed two surveys to report on
their pregnancy intention, antenatal depression, PND, IPV during pregnancy,
their partner’s (i.e., father’s) involvement during pregnancy and after
childbirth, and perceived social support. Comparisons were made between
women with unintended pregnancy and those with intended pregnancy, and
the effects of unintended pregnancy, father involvement, IPV, and other
factors on maternal PND were examined. Results show that women with
unintended pregnancy were more likely to report PND, IPV, fear, postnatal
stress, lower degree of father involvement, and lower level of social support.

Unintended pregnancy independently increased the risk of PND by 1.95
times (95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.15, 3.28]), after adjustment for all
other variables. When father involvement was included in the regression
model, the negative effects of IPV and the related fear on PND became
nonsignificant. The positive association between unintended pregnancy and
PND was robust. Father involvement might help promote maternal health
by reducing the negative effects of IPV on PND.

## Introduction

Postnatal depression (PND) is a major health problem that affects approximately 8% to 19% of women globally (Chaudron, 2003). It has been well
demonstrated in literature that PND could lead to various serious negative
health consequences on the family as a whole and that it may not only hamper
mothers’ physical and mental health (World Health Organization, 2008) but
also affect the health of other family members including their partners and
children (Leung et al., 2011; McPeak, Sandrock, Spector, & Pattishall, 2015).
Known risk factors for PND include a previous history of depression,
antenatal depression and anxiety, stressful life events, young age, low socioeconomic status, difficult infant temperament, poor marital relationship, and
a lack of social support (Beck, 2001; Dagher & Shenassa, 2012; Darcy et al.,
2011; Nakku, Nakasi, & Mirembe, 2006; O’Hara & Swain, 1996; Robertson,
Grace, Wallington, & Stewart, 2004). Among all the identified risk factors in
literature, unintended pregnancy is one of the most commonly addressed yet
under-investigated. Unintended pregnancy is not a rare phenomenon, and it
affects almost half of the mothers in the United States and up to one-fourth of
the mothers in Asian countries (C. Y. Chan et al., 2013; Finer & Zolna, 2016;
Koh, Chui, Tang, & Lee, 2014). Past research has demonstrated the link
between unintended pregnancy and maternal PND (Abajobir, Maravilla,
Alati, & Najman, 2016; Abbasi, Chuang, Dagher, Zhu, & Kjerulff, 2013;
Brito, Alves, Ludermir, & Araújo, 2015); however, findings about the underlying mechanisms are scarce. Latest effort often focuses on the moderating
and/or mediating effects of factors such as ethnicity, stress, and anxiety in
explaining the association (Abbasi et al., 2013).
In the recent decade, father involvement at different stages of pregnancy
and childbirth has attracted increased attention worldwide (K. L. Chan, Emery,
Fulu, Tolman, & Ip, 2017). It has been shown that father involvement may be


-----

associated with better maternal health (K. K. L. Chan & Paterson-Brown,
2002; Dudgeon & Inhorn, 2004), paternal health (Plantin, Olykoya, & Ny,
2011), infant health (Teitler, 2001), increased partner satisfaction with their
relationship (Bondas-Salonen, 1998), and reduced intimate partner violence
(IPV; K. L. Chan et al., 2017). Due to the lack of systematic and comprehensive empirical studies on father involvement and health, the mechanisms
underlying the associations between them remain inconclusive. Some preliminary research has suggested several possible pathways. For example, father
involvement during and beyond pregnancy may promote paternal health by
facilitating development of positive paternal health behaviors, such as cessation of smoking, alcohol consumption, or drug use (Bottorff, Radsma, Kelly,
& Oliffe, 2009). These positive health behaviors among fathers do not only
promote paternal health; they have been demonstrated to also facilitate both
maternal and child health, possibly serving as a protective factor against poor
pregnancy and obstetric outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight
(Finnbogadottir, Crang, & Persson, 2003).
Given that the above factors are closely associated with unintended pregnancy and PND (Crempien, Rojas, Cumsille, & Oda, 2011; Walsh, Keyes,
Koenen, & Hasin, 2015; Wang et al., 2017), father involvement may act as a
protective factor for reducing the risk of PND among mothers with unintended pregnancy. Yet, existing research has failed to investigate the influence of father involvement during pregnancy and after childbirth, an alterable
variable, on such associations. This study set out research questions to fill the
research gap by investigating the role of father involvement in the association
between unintended pregnancy, IPV, and maternal PND. The research
hypotheses include the following: (a) unintended pregnancy is associated
with maternal PND, IPV, and lower level of social support and (b) father
involvement reduces the negative effects of IPV on PND.

## Method

 Study Design and Sample

This study was conducted within a sample of mothers who had attended the
antenatal check-up during 2016 and 2017 in four major public hospitals in
Hong Kong. A baseline survey was conducted on the sample during their
pregnancy, and a follow-up survey was conducted around 4 weeks postpartum. Sample recruitment was population based. During the study period, all
pregnant women with less than 24 weeks of gestation who showed up in the
antenatal clinic in one of the four research sites, namely, Kwong Wah
Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, and Prince Wales


-----

Hospital, were considered eligible and invited to participate in the study. To
ensure the representativeness of the sample, no limit on ethnicity or nationality was set. Those who could not understand Chinese or English, which were
the main languages used in this study, were excluded from the sample.
Pregnant women excluded due to language barrier comprised less than 1% of
the total number of eligible participants. In addition, about 1% of the eligible
participants who were below the age of 18 years and those who were unable
to give informed consent were excluded.

## Data Collection Procedures

All subject recruitment and data collection procedures were approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the Hospital Authority Research Ethics
Committees of all the four selected hospitals, and there was no important
change made after the commencement of the study. Participation in the study
was voluntary, informed consent was provided, and anonymity and confidentiality of information was guaranteed. Once identified as abused, participants
were encouraged to seek help and were provided with the necessary information for referral. Health professionals at the four hospitals were trained and
available for assistance in case of emergency.
During the study period, all eligible pregnant women who attended the
antenatal clinic of the four hospitals were informed about the study details
and participant’s rights in private rooms in the hospitals. In particular, they
were ensured that refusal to participate would not affect any service they
received at the hospitals. Eligible women who agreed to participate provided
written consent and completed the baseline survey that assessed their antenatal depression, IPV experiences, pregnancy intention, and demographic characteristics in the private room. Participants also indicated their preferred
methods of contact for the follow-up survey after giving birth to their children (e.g., via phone, by mail, by e-mail, etc.).
About 4 weeks after their expected date of delivery, participants were contacted for the follow-up survey. They were asked to complete a structured
questionnaire that assessed their PND, anxiety, stress level, IPV experience,
health-related quality of life (HRQoL), perceived social support, and the
degree of father involvement in their pregnancy. During the follow-up survey, participants were reminded again their right to refuse participation, to
terminate the interview, and to ignore any item either verbally or in printed
form. Anonymity and confidentiality were assured. No incentives were given
to the participants. Although there was no potential harm expected, medical
and health professionals at the four hospitals were available for assistance in
case of emergency.

## Study Variables and Measures

_Antenatal and PND. Mothers’ levels of depressive symptoms experienced dur-_
ing pregnancy and after childbirth were assessed with the Chinese version of
the 10-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (CEPDS; Lee et al., 2018).
Items were rated on a Likert-type scale from 0 to 3. Total scores ranged from 0
to 30, with higher scores indicating more severe depression levels. This study
employed a cutoff score of 10, which was recommended to screen for PND in
the general Chinese population in Hong Kong (Lee et al., 2018). The CEPDS
demonstrated good reliability in this study, with a Cronbach’s alpha of .85.

_Pregnancy intention. Mothers were asked whether their current pregnancy was_
intended or not with a yes/no item. Responses were then classified as
“intended pregnancy” or “unintended pregnancy” in this study.

_IPV during pregnancy. Mothers’ experiences of IPV during pregnancy were_
measured using four items modified from the Chinese version of the Abuse
Assessment Screen (AAS; Tiwari et al., 2007). Items were rated on a yes/no
(0/1) scale. Three of the four items assessed mothers’ experiences of psychological aggression, physical assault, and sexual coercion by their partner
during pregnancy, and one assessed whether the mothers experienced fear
from the IPV.

_Father involvement during pregnancy and after childbirth. Father involvement_
was assessed with 10 items developed in this study. The items recorded the
degree that the fathers provided emotional support for the mothers (one item;
that is, whether the fathers would comfort their partner when she felt sad), the
degree that they provided instrumental assistance on daily housework (six
items; for example, taking care of pregnant women’s diet, feeding the newborns, helping replace the diapers, etc.), the frequency of attending antenatal
check-ups with the expectant mothers (one item), the frequency of attending
parent education classes (one item), and the frequency of seeing ultrasound
pictures during check-ups with the mothers (one item). The items assessing
father involvement in daily housework and emotional support were rated on
a 4-point scale from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating higher degree of
involvement. The father involvement in daily housework demonstrated good
reliability in this study, with a Cronbach’s alpha of .86.

_Postnatal anxiety and stress. Postnatal anxiety and stress levels were assessed_
using the Chinese version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale
(DASS; Moussa, Lovibond, & Laube, 2011). The seven-item Anxiety and the


-----

seven-item Stress subscales were used, and all items were rated on a 4-point
scale, with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety or stress. The Anxiety and Stress subscales showed good reliabilities in this study, with Cronbach’s alpha of .75 and .84, respectively.

_Postnatal HRQoL. Mothers’ postnatal HRQoL was assessed with the 12-item_
Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12; Lam, Tse, & Gandek, 2005). Scores on
the SF-12 were computed as two separate composite scores: one for physical
health–related QoL (PCS) and the other for mental health–related QoL
(MCS). Both PCS and MCS ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health-related QoL. The SF-12 achieved a Cronbach’s alpha of .85,
indicating good reliability in this study.

_Perceived social support. Mothers’ perceived social support was measured_
using the Chinese version of the 12-item Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS-C; Chou, 2000). Three sources of support
were assessed, including support from family (four items), support from
friends (four items), and support from some significant others (four items).
Items were rated on a 7-point scale from 1 to 7. The total score ranged from
12 to 72, with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived support.
The reliability of the overall scale and the subscales was good, with Cronbach’s alpha ranging from .90 to .94.

_Demographic characteristics. During the baseline survey, mothers’ demo-_
graphic characteristics were recorded. These variables included their age,
highest education attainment, employment status, marital status, monthly
household income, whether they had any chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, heart disease, cancer, etc.), and whether they were receiving
social security assistance from the government.

## Statistical Analyses

In this study, all statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 24.0 using a
significance level of 0.05. The demographic characteristics, as well as the
pregnancy intention, of the mothers were summarized using descriptive statistics. The demographic characteristics were then compared between the two
groups with intended pregnancy and unintended pregnancy using chi-square
tests and t tests. The mean scores of the scales assessing depression, anxiety,
stress level, HRQoL, and social support were summarized by descriptive statistics and compared between the two groups using t tests. However, the proportions of mothers with CEPDS scores higher than the cutoff of 10, the
proportion of mothers reporting IPV, and the proportion of fathers being


-----

involved during the pregnancy and after childbirth were compared between
groups using the chi-square tests.
To examine the associations between unintended pregnancy and PND and
the effects of father involvement, IPV during pregnancy, and social support on
those associations, a series of multiphase logistic regression analyses with the
proportion of mothers with PND (i.e., with CEPDS score higher than 10) as the
dependent variable were conducted. In the multiphase logistic regression models, it was hypothesized that the variables in early phases would affect those in
later phases, but not the vice versa. In Phase 1, a forward stepwise logistic
regression was conducted with all demographic characteristics as independent
variables. In Phase 2, pregnancy intention, IPV during pregnancy, and fear
resulted from IPV were entered as independent variables. In Phase 3, the different types of father involvement were included in the forward stepwise regression model; while in Phase 4, perceived social support was included as the
independent variable. In this study, the Hosmer and Lemeshow (H-L) Test was
used to assess the goodness of fit of the logistic regression models (Hosmer &
Lemeshow, 2000). A nonsignificant result implied adequacy of the model.

## Results

 Sample Characteristics

In this study, a total of 1,737 eligible pregnant women agreed to participate
and completed the baseline survey, and 1,083 of them remained and completed the follow-up survey, resulting in a retention rate of 62.3%.
Demographic characteristics, antenatal depression, anxiety, stress, HRQoL,
fear, IPV physical assault, and sexual coercion by their partner during pregnancy were compared between those who completed both surveys and those
who completed only the baseline survey, and no statistically significant difference was found. The only difference is on IPV psychological aggression
during pregnancy. Those who completed only the baseline survey reported
6% psychological aggression during pregnancy, but those who completed
both surveys reported 14%. It does not seem that IPV psychological aggression had impact on the attrition.
Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the final sample. In
this sample, mothers with unintended pregnancy comprised 16.4% (n = 178).
The mean age of the overall sample was 31.3 years (SD = 4.6 years).
Approximately 78.8% were employed as full-time workers and 93.7% were
married or cohabiting with their partner during the study period. Between-group
comparisons were conducted between mothers with intended pregnancy and
those with unintended pregnancy, and no significant difference was found in any
of these demographic characteristics (all p > .05).

PCS and 52.27 (SD = 8.00) for MCS, while that of MSPSS-C was 71.51
(SD = 10.69) overall.
Significant differences were observed between the mothers with intended
pregnancy and those with unintended pregnancy. When compared to those
with intended pregnancy, mothers with unintended pregnancy reported significantly higher level of PND symptoms (p < .05), lower degree of father
involvement during pregnancy and after childbirth (all p < .001), greater likelihood of experiencing IPV (p < .01) and fear resulted from IPV (p < .05),
higher level of postnatal stress, and lower degree of perceived social support
from family, friends, and significant others (all p < .05).
Table 3 lists the proportion of mothers who reported a CEPDS score higher
than the cutoff of 10 in this study. Overall, 26.4% of the mothers could be
identified as having antenatal depression and 9.3% as having PND. Significant
between-group difference was observed in PND: significantly a greater proportion of mothers with unintended pregnancy could be identified as having
PND than their counterparts (16.9% vs. 7.8%, p < .01).
Table 4 shows Pearson’s correlation of all the variables used in the
regression analysis, except those categorical variables. Table 5 shows the
summary of the results of the multiphase logistic regression analyses. In
Phase 1, none of the demographic characteristics was significantly associated with PND (which was operationalized a CEPDS score over the cutoff
of 10). In Phase 2, unintended pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.19,
95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.36, 3.55], p < .01), IPV during pregnancy

(aOR = 1.78, 95% CI = [1.04, 3.03], p < .05), and fear (aOR = 3.10, 95% CI

father involvement was included in Phase 3, only unintended pregnancy
(aOR = 1.97, 95% CI [1.18, 3.28], p <.01), fear (aOR = 2.88, 95% CI [1.25,
6.64], p <.05), and fathers’ emotional support (aOR = 0.58, 95% CI = [0.41,
0.83], p <.01) were significant factors. Finally, in Phase 4, when social support was added to the regression model, only unintended pregnancy
remained as significant risk factor for PND (aOR = 1.95, 95% CI = [1.15,
3.28], p < .05), while fathers’ emotional support (aOR = 0.68, 95% CI =

[0.46, 0.99], p < .05) and social support (aOR = 0.95, 95% CI = [0.93, 0.97],
_p < .001) were two significant protective factors for PND. The final model_
accounted for 16.7% of variance of PND measured 4 weeks postpartum.

## Discussion

 Main Findings

The findings of this study show that unintended pregnancy was the major risk
factor that increased almost twice of the PND risk among mothers after the
adjustment of other variables, supporting the link found in previous metaanalysis in literature (Abajobir et al., 2016). Fathers’ emotional support and
social support from family, friends, and significant others, however, were two
protective factors for PND among the Chinese mothers. When father involvement was included, the previously significant effect of IPV and fear resulted
from IPV incidents on PND became nonsignificant, implying the possible
effect of father involvement on reducing the negative effects of IPV on maternal PND.
This study also reveals reliable estimates on the rates of unintended pregnancy and PND. Approximately 16% of the mothers in Hong Kong reported
unintended pregnancy, and this rate falls into the range 9% to 25% found in
previous studies in Hong Kong (C. Y. Chan et al., 2013; Koh et al., 2014);
although it is not comparable to the rates found in previous Western studies
(e.g., 45% in a national survey in the United States; Finer & Zolna, 2016). As
for maternal PND, the 9% rate found in this study falls into the lower end of
the range of 9% to 22% observed in a Chinese study which used the same
cutoff of CEPDS (Leung et al., 2011).

## Interpretation

The positive association between unintended pregnancy and PND is supported in this study, providing convergent evidence to the past findings that


-----

PND is more likely to among mothers with unintended pregnancy found both
in Western countries and in Asian countries (Abajobir et al., 2016; Abbasi
et al., 2013; Ahmad et al., 2018; Brito et al., 2015; Chi, Zhang, Wu, & Wang,
2016). Although some have suggested the possible effects of antenatal
depression on this association (Abbasi et al., 2013), the current findings indicate that neither antenatal depression was more likely among mothers with
unintended pregnancy, nor antenatal depression could significantly increase
the risk of PND at 4 weeks postpartum. Instead, unintended pregnancy was
independently linked to PND, even after the adjustment for other factors,
providing support to the independent effect of unintended pregnancy among
the mixed findings in literature (Abbasi et al., 2013; Brito et al., 2015).
The current findings demonstrate that mothers with unintended pregnancy
were more likely to experience IPV during pregnancy, and those experiences
might be linked to greater risk of PND. This extends the existing knowledge
that unintended pregnancy increases the risk of IPV (Wang et al., 2017) and
that IPV increases the risk of PND (Adamu & Adinew, 2018; Ali, Ali, &
Azam, 2009; Desmarais, Pritchard, Lowder, & Janssen, 2014), by showing
the potential role of IPV in the positive association between unintended pregnancy and PND. Researchers have suggested the possible impact of IPV during pregnancy on the emotional health among mothers. For example, it might
increase the risk of negative health behaviors and mood disorders and in turn
increase the risk of PND (Walsh et al., 2015). Among the negative impacts
aroused by IPV, fear might be one major negative emotion that could be
linked to both IPV and depression or PND (Crempien et al., 2011). Indeed,
this study demonstrated that fear resulted from IPV played a significant role
in increasing the risk of PND, indicating that fear related to IPV might be one
underlying factor in explaining PND among mother victims.
Father involvement, in the form of emotional support to the mothers,
was found to reduce the risk of maternal PND. It was shown that when
fathers’ emotional support was included, the previously significant effects
of pregnancy IPV and fear on PND became nonsignificant, indicating the
potential effectiveness of fathers’ support on reducing the negative health
consequences related to pregnancy IPV. On one hand, the protective effect
of fathers’ emotional support may directly reduce the negative emotions
and mood problems of mothers, lowering the risk of the onset of PND. On
the other hand, father involvement may have indirect effect on PND. It has
been suggested that involved fathers may be better prepared for fatherhood
(K. L. Chan et al., 2017), which reduces the likelihood of conflicts between
the couples due to pregnancy and child care and in turn increases marital
satisfaction (Galovan, Holmes, Schramm, & Lee, 2013), an important protective factor for both IPV and maternal PND (Adamu & Adinew, 2018;


-----

Stith, Green, Smith, & Ward, 2008). It is noteworthy that fathers’ emotional
support remained as a significant protective factor even when more general
social support was included in the model, demonstrating that fathers’ support could stand out as an independent source of protection against PND
among mothers.

## Strengths and Limitations

The major strength of this study is the inclusion of father involvement in the
associations between unintended pregnancy and maternal PND. Although
there has been emerging evidence that father involvement may promote
maternal health (K. L. Chan et al., 2017; Gungor & Beji, 2007; Liamputtong
& Naksook, 2003), solid empirical evidence from large-scale studies, especially Asian studies, has been scarce. This study provides important evidence
supporting the effectiveness of father involvement in reducing the negative
consequences of unintended pregnancy on maternal PND.
Another strength of this study is the comprehensive operationalization of
father involvement, which has been varying greatly across studies (Gungor &
Beji, 2007; Liamputtong & Naksook, 2003). This study examines the concept
by including various aspects of father involvement before and after childbirth.
Aspects such as instrumental support, emotional support, and the involvement
in education classes were all covered. Findings would shed important lights on
the operationalization of father involvement in future studies.
Despite the above strengths of this study, there were some methodological limitations. This study only measured PND at about 4 weeks postpartum. Within this time frame, some PND cases might be undetected, since
the onset of PND may be beyond the 4 weeks of postpartum (Kettunen,
Koistinen, & Hintikka, 2014). Besides, the inclusion of only four out of
eight public hospitals might impose limitation on the representativeness of
the findings. Without the coverage of all hospitals in the city, the representativeness would not be able to reach the maximum. In addition, this study
did not include all potential factors in explaining PND. For example, health
of newborns and marital satisfaction might be some examples of the possible factors that could be associated with unintended pregnancy and PND
(McPeak et al., 2015; Odinka et al., 2018). Future research may consider
including more variables, such as health of other family members and previous history of depression and anxiety of the mothers, in developing the
model to explain maternal PND. Another limitation is that the measures of
father involvement and PND were based on mother’s self-report. Father
may have different perception of involvement in terms of instrumental or
emotional support (K. L. Chan et al., 2017). Including father’s report of


-----

involvement might provide different perspective in understanding the protective effect of father involvement. Self-report on PND using CEPDS is
not for the determination of clinical depression. Medical professional’s
diagnosis would be required to provide more comprehensive assessment of
PND, types, and severity of abuses as well.

## Conclusion

This study shows that unintended pregnancy increases the risk of maternal
PND assessed 4 weeks postpartum. This positive association is robust and
remains significant after the adjustment of potential confounding and associated factors. Results also support that IPV and the related fear during pregnancy could be a risk factor of maternal PND, but the strength of these
associations would be reduced with increased levels of emotional support
provided by fathers. This highlights the importance of promoting father
involvement during pregnancy and after childbirth to benefit maternal health
and provides insights on the need for concerted efforts from relevant institutions to enable fathers to be available for being involved in pregnancy, childbirth, and child care and, more importantly, to neither accept nor inadvertently
create barriers to that involvement.
