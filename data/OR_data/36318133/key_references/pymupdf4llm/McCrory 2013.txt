## Abstract

_Background: Unintended pregnancy is associated with increased risk for adverse neonatal and early childhood_
outcomes spanning an array of indicators, but it remains unclear whether these risks hold independent of other
biological, social and environmental risk factors.
_Methods: This study uses data from the first wave of the ‘Growing Up in Ireland Study’, a large nationally repre-_
sentative cohort study of more than 11 000 infants, to examine the risk factors associated with unintended pregnancy. Adopting a staged approach to the analysis, the study investigates whether pregnancy intention influences
maternal health behaviours during pregnancy independent of background characteristics, and whether pregnancy
intention carries any additional risk for adverse infant and maternal health outcomes when we adjust for background characteristics and prenatal behaviours.
_Results: The study confirmed that sociodemographic factors are strongly associated with unintended pregnancy_
and that unintended pregnancy is associated with a range of health compromising behaviours that are known to
be harmful to the developing fetus. While there was little evidence to suggest that pregnancy intention was
associated with adverse neonatal outcomes or developmental delay independent of other covariates, there was
strong evidence that intention status had a bearing on the mother’s psychosocial health. Unintended pregnancy
was associated with increased risk of depression (risk ratio 1.36 [95% confidence interval 1.19, 1.54]), and higher
parenting stress (risk ratio 1.27 [95% confidence interval 1.16, 1.38]).
_Conclusions: Ascertaining the mother’s pregnancy intention during the first antenatal visit may represent a means_
for monitoring those at greatest risk for adverse mother and child outcomes.

**Keywords: pregnancy intention, neonatal health, child development, parental psychosocial health.**


Although studies differ in their characterisation of
pregnancy intention,[1] unintended pregnancy (UIP) is
usually defined as a pregnancy that is mistimed (i.e.
occurs earlier or later than was intended) or is
unwanted.[2] UIPs are important from a public policy
perspective because they are associated with
increased risk for adverse neonatal outcomes, including preterm birth (PTB)[3] and low birthweight (LBW).[4]

Other studies have documented deficits extending
into early childhood,[5] and adulthood,[6] although at
present it is unclear whether these effects hold independent of other biological, social and environmental
risk factors.[1]

Less well understood are the reasons why UIP
leads to worse outcomes.[7] UIP may serve as a marker
for other social disadvantages, which operate as independent risk factors for worse outcomes.[7] UIP may
also influence maternal health behaviours during the
prenatal period and these decisions can have important implications for fetal growth and development.
Alternatively, it could be that women with a UIP may

-----

experience less prenatal care, or delay seeking prenatal
care.[8] Finally, and less explored, are the psychosocial
pathways through which UIP leads to adverse outcomes. For example, studies have documented poorer
levels of psychological health among women with
UIPs, including higher rates of depression, higher
levels of perceived stress, and lower levels of partner
and social support.[9]

## Pregnancy intention and pre-conceptional and prenatal behaviours

A number of studies have examined the impact of UIP
on maternal health behaviours during pregnancy,
noting that those for whom the pregnancy was unintended are more likely to engage in health compromising behaviours, including smoking during
pregnancy,[10–13] failing to adhere to recommendations
regarding vitamin supplementation[10,14,15] and delaying
the timing of the first antenatal booking appointment.[8,10,12,13] A recent study of maternal and neonatal
consequences of UIP in rural India has also shown
variations in the use of recommended prenatal care,
with unwanted pregnancies over twice as likely as
wanted pregnancies to receive inadequate prenatal
care.[16] Other studies, however, have found that UIP
does not carry any excess risk of smoking during
pregnancy when background factors have been controlled for.[17,18]

## Pregnancy intention and neonatal outcomes

Most studies investigating this issue have focused on
the immediate neonatal period but it has been argued
that methodologically rigorous studies examining the
relationship between pregnancy intention and neonatal outcomes are lacking.[19] The evidence from the
stronger studies would seem to indicate that
unwanted status does not carry any additional risk for
adverse neonatal outcomes when maternal background characteristics and differences in prenatal
behaviours are controlled for.[4,18] A systematic review[4]

found that UIP was associated with significantly
increased odds of PTB and LBW in the unadjusted
analysis, but that the relationship with PTB no longer
held in the multivariable adjusted model. When the
unintended category was further disaggregated into
unwanted and mistimed pregnancies, there was no
higher risk for LBW in the adjusted models.

Pregnancy intention and infant and mother health 209

## Pregnancy intention and mother and child outcomes

Fewer studies have examined the impact of pregnancy
intention on children’s outcomes beyond the immediate neonatal period, and among those that have, findings have been mixed. Analysis of data from the
National Maternal and Infant Health Survey found
that although unwanted pregnancy was associated
with worse global health ratings, over-activity and
lower scores on a composite developmental index,
these effects were eroded when adjusted for maternal
characteristics and social and biological risk factors.[20]

A separate analysis of the same data set[5] found that
across each of the assessed outcomes (less than excellent health, over-activity and the composite developmental score), UIP was associated with less favourable
outcomes. Finally, Carson and collaborators did not
note any significant differences in the cognitive scores
of children resulting from unplanned vs. planned
pregnancies at 3 or 5 years of age after adjusting for
the marked socio-economic differences that existed
between groups.[21]

## Pregnancy intention and parent psychosocial health

While research on the impact of UIP on the mother’s
mental health and psychosocial outcomes is limited,[1]

there is evidence that UIP may modify the psychosocial health of mothers, by impacting on the levels of
stress, anxiety and depression she may experience.[9]

One study found that mothers with UIPs were more
likely to report higher levels of depression and lower
levels of happiness than mothers with planned pregnancies, spent less leisure time with their children,
and were more likely to use physical punishment
with their children than other mothers.[22] Even after
controlling for sociodemographic variables, research
indicates that UIP predicts poorer psychosocial outcomes for mothers.[23,24]

Given the discrepant pattern of results that has
emerged across studies, this study attempts to discern
whether there are any significant effects of pregnancy
intention on a variety of maternal prenatal behaviours,
infant outcomes, and parental psychosocial variables
independent of background factors using data from
the first wave of the Growing Up in Ireland Study – a
large nationally representative study of more than
11 000 infants who were first assessed at 9 months of

age. The objectives of this was study were to (i) assess
the relationship between pre-conceptional and postpartum behaviours;[10] and (ii) explore infant outcomes
in relation to UIP beyond the immediate perinatal
period.[21]

## Methods

 Sample selection and recruitment

Children who would have been 9 months of age at the
time of interview (between September 2008 and April
2009) were selected from the Child Benefit Register
(CBR) provided by the Department of Social and
Family Affairs. The CBR was used as a sampling frame
because child benefit is a universal welfare entitlement in Ireland and has practically complete coverage
of all children born in the Republic of Ireland at the
time of the study. The sample was selected on a systematic basis, pre-stratifying by marital status, county
of residence, nationality and number of children (i.e.
less than 16 years of age) in the household to ensure
that households less likely to respond were oversampled, using a random start and constant sampling
fraction. The total eligible CBR population was all
births occurring during the period December 2007 to
June 2008, which amounted to 41 185 children. A total
of 17 264 families were approached to take part in the
study, of which 64.5% (n = 11 134) families consented
to participate.
The sample weights were constructed by adjusting
the distribution of the sample to known population
figures. The population distributions were derived
from two sources. The first source was from tabulations, which were prepared by the Central Statistics
Office on the number and characteristics of children
(aged less than 1 year) and their families from the
2006 Census of Population. The second source was the
CBR from which the sample was drawn. The 73 662
children registered on the CBR as being born in the
calendar year 2008 were taken as the population to
which the sample was statistically weighted and
grossed in statistically re-adjusting the sample.
The project was subject to ethical approval by a
Research Ethics Committee convened by the Department of Health and Children. A letter of introduction
was sent to the family a few days in advance of their
first contact. Interviewers were instructed to make
initial visits to households in person. Interviewers
administered the main questionnaires on laptops, and


respondents completed a second, more sensitive questionnaire on a Computer Assisted Self-Interview
(CASI) basis.

## Assessment of pregnancy intention

Information regarding pregnancy intention was
obtained retrospectively when the child was 9 months
of age by means of a survey question on the sensitive
questionnaire administered on a CASI basis. This
questionnaire was designed to capture other sensitive information relating to the respondent’s marital
status and life style related behaviours during pregnancy. Pregnancy intention was assessed by means of
a question, which asked the mother whether she had
intended to become pregnant before the study child
was conceived. Responses were categorised into two
categories: intended and unintended. The intended
category included those who said that they had
planned to become pregnant at that time (n = 6260).
The unintended category included both unwanted

[no intention of ever becoming pregnant (n = 1054)],
unsure (n = 779) and mistimed pregnancies [either
later (n = 1086), much later (n = 711) or earlier than
intended (n = 677)]. It was assumed that all pregnancies in this category involved potentially adverse
experiences for the mother, given the unwanted,
uncertain or mistimed nature of the pregnancy.
The mother was asked two questions regarding
folic acid use: (1) whether she had taken folic acid
before pregnancy, and (2) whether she had taken folic
acid during the first 3 months of her pregnancy.
Dosage and type of preparation of folic acid were not
specified. The mother also self-completed a sensitive
CASI questionnaire, which asked whether she had
smoked during the course of her pregnancy or drank
alcohol during the course of her pregnancy.
Assessed neonatal outcomes included whether
there were any complications during the child’s birth
(yes/no), whether the child was born LBW (<2500 or
�2500 g) and whether the child was delivered
preterm (i.e. earlier than 37 weeks).

## Children’s developmental status at 9 months

Developmental competencies at 9 months of age was
assessed using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire
(ASQ),[25] which is a parent-report instrument that produces subscale scores and a dichotomous pass/fail
threshold for each of five skill areas: communication,

gross motor, fine motor, problem solving and
personal-social development. Although Growing Up
in Ireland asked a set of items that spanned multiple
age ranges, this analysis uses the 10-month age interval score as the most appropriate single score for the
9-month-old infants. Other authors[26] have reported
positively on the use of parent-report methods for
detecting developmental delay and the ASQ’s psychometric properties were described as ‘excellent’ in a
review of such instruments by the American Academy
of Pediatrics.[27]

## Psychosocial outcomes

 Maternal depression

Maternal depression was indexed using the eight-item
Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale
(CESD-8), which is a short self-report screening
instrument for depression in the general population.[28]

Responses are indicated on a four-point rating scale:
‘rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day)’, ‘some or
a little of the time (1–2 days)’, ‘occasionally or a moderate amount of the time (3–4 days)’ and ‘most or all
of the time (5–7 days)’ with a reference period of the
previous 7 days. A composite score is calculated by
summing item responses (range 0–24). Scores can also
be dichotomised with a score seven or greater suggesting a clinically significant level of psychological
distress. The CESD has good internal consistency reliability (alpha = 0.86) and the concurrent validity of the
scale has been established through its association with
other depression measures such as the Beck Depression Inventory.[28]

## Maternal perception of the child’s temperament

The six-item fussy-difficult subscale of the Infant
Characteristics Questionnaire was used to index difficult infant temperament.[29] Respondents rate the perceived ease or difficulty of their infant’s temperament
on a seven-point rating scale with scores at the higher
end of the spectrum representing a more difficult disposition. The scale has good internal consistency with
an alpha of 0.79 and test–retest reliability of 0.70 over
a 30-day interval. Convergence between parent and
independent observer ratings of 0.61 has been
reported for the fussy-difficult scale.[29]

## Parenting stress

The parental stress scale is an 18-item self-report
instrument, which was designed to assess parenting
stress.[30] Respondents indicate their level of agreement
to a series of statements regarding the parenting role
on a five-point Likert-scale with responses ranging
from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The instrument produces scores for each of four subscales:
Parental rewards, Parental stressors, Lack of control
and Parental satisfaction. A total stress score is calculated by summing across the four subscales, with
scores ranging between 18 and 90 (higher scores being
indicative of higher parenting stress).

## Statistical analysis

Non-biological mothers were not asked the question
relating to pregnancy intention (n = 181) and a further
386 mothers declined to answer the question resulting
in an analytic sample of 10 567. With the exception of
income, which was missing for 7.4% of the sample,
the degree of missing data was relatively small. We
created a dummy variable for cases missing on
income to bring them back into the analysis. We first
describe the sociodemographic characteristics of the
sample by pregnancy intention status and report the
independent association of each of these factors with
intention status by fitting log-Poisson regression
models expressing the risk ratio (RR) and associated
95% confidence intervals (CI) estimated using a
Poisson model with robust variance estimator. We
then estimate the unadjusted and multivariable
adjusted RRs of engaging in health compromising
prenatal behaviours adjusting for demographic characteristics. Finally, we present the unadjusted and
multivariable adjusted RRs for adverse infant and
maternal health outcomes adjusting for the set of
demographic and prenatal life style-related behaviours. All analyses were undertaken using stata
(version 12.0).

## Results

Overall, 40.7% of the sample reported that they had a
UIP. Table 1 describes the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample by pregnancy intention status.
Lower social class, income and education were all
associated with increased risk for a UIP, as was
unmarried status. Coming from a white non-Irish or a

black ethic/racial background was also associated
with increased risk for a UIP.
Table 2 shows the relationship between pregnancy
intention and maternal prenatal behaviours controlling for the set of maternal background characteristics
shown in Table 1. Having a UIP was associated with
higher risk of smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and attending later on average for the first prenatal booking appointment. UIP was also associated
with a significantly lower probability that the mother
would take periconceptional folic acid or folic acid
during the first 3 months of pregnancy.
Table 3 provides the unadjusted (model 1) and multivariable adjusted RR controlling for maternal background characteristics and maternal prenatal health
behaviours (model 2). Of the three assessed neonatal
outcomes, only one was associated with pregnancy
intention status with a UIP being associated with


increased risk for birthing complications in the final
model (RR 1.08 [95% CI 1.02, 1.14]). Although a UIP
was associated with significantly increased risk of
failing to meet the developmental milestone typical of
children of this age on the gross motor component
of the ASQ, this association was fully eroded in the
multivariable analysis.
Unintended pregnancy was associated with
increased risk of scoring above the 80th percentile on
the Parental Stress Scale, and the effect remained after
adjustment for confounding variables. Compared with
those for whom the pregnancy was intended, the RR of
scoring above the 80th percentile on the parental stress
scale was 1.27 [95% CI 1.16, 1.38] among those who
characterised their pregnancy as unintended. A UIP
was also associated with significantly higher risk of
obtaining a clinically significant depression score on
the CESD (RR 1.36 [95% CI 1.19, 1.54]).

## Comment

This study has confirmed that sociodemographic and
socio-economic factors are associated with UIP, and
that UIP is a risk factor for a range of prenatal behav

iours that are deleterious to fetal health. There was
little evidence to suggest that pregnancy intention has
any impact on early infant health outcomes when we
control for maternal background characteristics and
maternal health behaviours during pregnancy. Indeed,

pregnancy intention was associated with only one of
the three neonatal outcomes. UIP was associated with
only one of the five ASQ components and the excess
risk of gross motor delay was fully attenuated in the
final model.
There was, however, strong evidence that UIP has a
bearing on the mother’s psychosocial health as evidenced by higher rates of depression and higher rates
of parenting stress among those for whom the pregnancy was unintended. These findings are suggestive
of a parent–child relationship that is under strain and
may provide a potential mediating pathway through
which pregnancy intention can come to influence later
outcomes.[5,6] Indeed, a common finding in the literature is that children who are exposed to a caregiving
environment in which the mother is suffering from
major depressive illness are at increased risk for a
range of adverse health outcomes, including emotional and behavioural maladjustment.[31]

This study has several limitations. First, the time
horizon for assessing the consequences of UIP is small
as it spans only the first 9 months of the infant’s life.
Second, some investigators[32,33] have questioned the
validity of using retrospective reports of pregnancy
intention because of response biases resulting from ex
_post rationalisation of pregnancy intention. It should_
be acknowledged however that the effects may be
under or overestimated[1] and that analysis of data from
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth cohort
revealed that the association between UIPs and children’s outcomes did not differ appreciably when
intention was assessed prospectively compared with
retrospectively.[18] Third, although higher rates of
maternal depression among those with unwanted and
mistimed pregnancies were documented, a baseline
measure for maternal depression was not available so
it is difficult to establish in a cross-sectional study
whether the relationship is causal. Finally, it could be
argued that the sample is highly selective as the
sample was selected from the CBR at 9 months of age
and hence excludes women who aborted their pregnancies. This group may differ in a number of important ways from those who went on to deliver an
unwanted pregnancy. However, given that abortion is
not legal in Ireland, except in very strict circumstances, this may not present a large challenge to the
validity of the results.
Among the major strengths of the study is the large
and representative nature of the sample, which
amounts to approximately one-sixth of all livebirths in


Ireland during this period, which allows for the estimation of robust main effects. In addition, we were
able to examine the impact of pregnancy intention
across a wide range of prenatal, neonatal and child
outcomes in the first 9 months of life, as well as the
effect of intention status on the parent–child dynamic
which has been identified as a major shortcoming in
the literature.[19] The finding that UIP is associated with
health compromising behaviours during pregnancy
and adverse maternal psychosocial health has clear
policy implications. Ascertaining the mother’s pregnancy intention during the first antenatal visit may
represent an opportunity to monitor those at greatest
risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes, and allow for
the development of interventions that may mitigate
the risk among those with unintended pregnancies.
