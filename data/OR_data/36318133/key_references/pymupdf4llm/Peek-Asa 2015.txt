**KEYWORDS. Domestic violence, psychology, ethnology**


**_INTRODUCTION_**

Violence against women is a major public health problem garnering
increased recognition in many different cultures and countries (ACOG,
1995; Bash, 1994; Campbell et al., 1995). Declarations made at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo (1994)
and the IV World Conference on Women in Beijing (1995) clearly established the need to better understand and reduce this problem (Duarte,
1994). Violence against women, especially violence perpetrated against
a woman by an intimate partner, was recognized to have many ethnic
and cultural contexts. The recent National Conference on Violence and
Reproductive Health: Science, Prevention and Action identified as a
central theme the need to better understand the perspectives of women
involved in violent intimate relationships in order to improve screening,
prevention, and services (Spitz and Marks, 2000; Campbell et al.,
2000).
In countries that collect violence-related data, intimate partner violence has been found to occur at all income levels and among all occupations, social classes, and ethnic and cultural groups (Straus and
Smith, 1990; Torres, 1991; Wilt and Olson, 1996), although perceptions of what constitutes abuse may differ (Torres, 1991). Cultural differences are an important predictor of perceptions and reactions to
abuse, and are especially important when designing intervention policies and practices (Straus and Smith, 1990; Ghazal and Hoyt, 1993;


-----

_Peek-Asa et al._ _167_

Perilla et al., 1994; Torres, 1987). While some research has focused on
differences among racial groups, limited research has examined ethnic
or cultural differences (Kaufman et al., 1994; Sorenson and Telles,
1991). These differences may be particularly crucial when adapting to a
new cultural environment, which can occur in many situations such as
immigration or intra-culture marriage. The role of cultural perceptions
of partner abuse is especially important in Southern California, which
has one of the largest immigrant populations in the world. Southern California is home to the largest Mexican-American population, and because of proximity and economic ties, remains closely related to Mexican
culture and customs.
Prevalence estimates of partner abuse in the United States range from
11% to 65% of women and in Mexico range from 33% to 61% of
women (Arbuckle et al., 1995; Abbot et al., 1996; Diaz-Olavarrieta and
Sotelo, 1996). In both countries, intimate partners are the most common
perpetrators of female homicide. Reasons for the variance in prevalence
estimates have not yet been adequately explained, and thus differences
in the prevalence and risk factors for abuse in different populations of
women are largely unknown. Research into the prevalence of abusive
events has been challenged by a lack of definition regarding what constitutes abuse and how this perception differs among groups of women
(Spitz and Marks, 2000; Campbell et al., 2000). This lack of knowledge
may lead to underestimates of abusive relationships among certain
groups because of either a lack of trust in divulging experiences or the
perception that certain events are not abusive within certain cultures.
Research in Southern California found that Mexican-born Latinas
had a lower lifetime prevalence of partner abuse than American-born
Latinas and Anglos (Sorenson and Telles, 1991), but may also have differing perceptions about what constitutes abuse. Further research found
that Anglo-American women perceived more behaviors to be abusive
than did Mexican-American women (Wilt and Olson, 1996). Specifically, emotional abuse, such as failure to provide adequate food and
shelter, was perceived as abusive by a larger proportion of AngloAmerican women than Mexican-American women (Wilt and Olson,
1996). Cumulative research findings indicate that cultural and social
factors, including stressors associated with acculturation and migration,
may be important predictors of intimate partner abuse for the Mexican
woman. Acculturation has been related to risk factors in partner abuse
including social support structure, access to extended family networks,
substance use, socioeconomic status, and access of medical care (Griffith and d’Villacencio, 1985; Caetano and Medina Mora, 1988; Holck


-----

_168_ _Domestic Violence and Health Care: Policies and Prevention_

et al., 1984; Rodriguez, 1999). Acculturation is a particularly vulnerable period because tensions in gender relations may occur with stresses
of moving and adapting to a new cultural environment, especially when
gender relations in the country of origin were patriarchal or asymmetrical (Dasgupta and Warrier, 1996). However, the relationship between
partner abuse and cultural competence is complicated, and could lead to
either an increase or decrease in abuse (Dasgupta and Warrier, 1996).
A more complete understanding of attitudes about what constitutes
an abusive event and how perceptions of the severity of these events
vary will enable health care providers to better identify and assist
women suffering abuse and will also help researchers better describe
cultural differences in risk. The purpose of this research was to examine
differences in the perceptions of intimate partner abuse indicators
among women in the United States and in Mexico to determine if systematic differences in the perception of abusive events is present. This
perception survey was conducted as part of a larger study examining the
prevalence of abuse in the two countries.


**_METHODS_**

The sample population was drawn from women in Los Angeles
County, California, United States and the cities of Cuernavaca and
Cuautla, Morelos, Mexico. Respondents were asked to assign a level of
perceived severity to 26 indicators of intimate partner abuse. The 26 indicators were from a screen used in the Domestic Violence in Mexican
and Mexican American Women study (DVMMAW) to assess the frequency and severity of intimate partner abuse during pregnancy. The
abuse screen was adapted from the Conflict Tactics Scale by researchers in Mexico (Castro) for use in both countries (Straus et al., 1996).
The 26 questions on the survey represent physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, and range from less severe events (being insulted) to very
severe events (being shot with a firearm). The responses from this perception survey will be used as weights to derive an index of abuse severity among women participating in the DVMMAW. For this analysis,
differences in perceived severity as reported by women from each
country will be examined.
The sample included 120 women from five groups in each country:
20 professional level researchers, 20 clerical workers, 20 graduate students, 20 undergraduate students, and 40 women recruited from health
clinics participating in the DVMMAW study. Respondents in the first

_Peek-Asa et al._ _169_

four groups were identified at large universities in each country. The
sample was not randomly drawn, but the study protocol was duplicated
exactly in each country. Thus, although the sample is small and nonrandom, groups in the two countries are comparable.
The mean age of women sampled in the US was 29.2 years, which
was significantly younger than the mean age of 33.2 years in Mexico.
Educational levels were similar for women in the professional, graduate, and undergraduate student groups, but among clerical workers and
clinic patients a higher proportion of women in the US reported having
a college education than women in Mexico. Women in the US were
more likely to report being single than women in Mexico for all groups
sampled. There were no differences based on occupational status.
Women were approached by a study researcher and asked to participate in a written survey about attitudes towards intimate partner violence. Women were not asked about their experiences with abuse.
Participation was voluntary and anonymous in both countries, and no
incentives were provided. Women were invited to participate without
regard to race/ethnicity. Among the US sample, 81% were born in the
US and 91% were raised in the US.
Participants were instructed to report their perceptions about the relative severity of each of the 26 events. Table 3 lists these events in the
order they were presented to respondents, which represents a randomlydrawn ordering. Respondents were instructed to read the 26 items and
identify the item they felt to be the least severe. This item was assigned
a severity level of one. On a scale from one to 100, women were then instructed to assign a severity score to each of the other items in relation to
the item scored as one. Women could chose the same severity level for
multiple events. This protocol was chosen after several pilot tests which
explored multiplicative scales with and without lower and upper boundaries. This method was the only protocol found to yield comparable,
calibrated responses.
The mean severity score rank order was determined for each of the 26
items and for each group of women sampled. When analyzing women
by respondent group, items were categorized into physical, sexual, and
emotional abuse. The overall mean of items in each category was calculated as the severity index for each type of abuse. Student’s t-tests were
used to test statistical significance of differences between women in the
US and Mexico by item.
Rasch analysis, a psychometric analytic technique developed explicitly to interpret this type of survey, was used to determine the internal
consistency of respondents and to form a calibrated scale representing


-----

_170_ _Domestic Violence and Health Care: Policies and Prevention_

perceptions of severity (Rasch, 1996; Wright, 1979). The Rasch method
follows the principle that each respondent should have consistent responses based on their individual attitudes and opinions, even if respondents disagree with one another (Thorndike, 1904; Guttman, 1944).
Thus, a respondent who views abuse as severe will be more likely to assign higher weights to each item, despite the protocol which encouraged
respondents to use the entire range of 1 to 100. Similarly, the most severe event in the 26-item index will have a correspondingly higher
probability of receiving a higher weight than less severe events.
In mathematical terms, two parameters govern the calibrated weight
of each item. The first, Bn, is the perception of severity of respondent n.
The second, Db, is the overall weight of item I relative to other weights.
The simplest equation denoting the probability of responses using B
and D is:


Pr{X = x} = θ(Bn, Di)

where theta (θ) is a probability function that allows the parameters B
and D to be estimated from observed data (Andrich, 1988). A linear solution for the probability function is:


Pr{x = 1|βn, δi} = exp(βn 2 δi)/[1 + exp(βn2 δi)]


in which βn and δi are the logarithms of Bn (respondents) and Di (items),
respectively. This equation generalizes to the entire matrix of N respondents and I items, and enables the items to be calibrated, i.e., placed on a
continuum using the logit scale (Tucker, 1953). The resulting model
provides logit scores that represent a linear calibration scale with a midpoint of zero. In the model for this study, larger negative values indicate
an increasing perception of severity. Rasch analysis was applied to the
survey responses to determine ranking and weights by item, country,
and respondent group. This study was analyzed using FACETS software (Linacre, 1989).

**_RESULTS_**


The calibrated logit, which presents severity scores on a logit scale,
indicates that the US women rated the overall severity of all events on
the index to be twice as severe as women in Mexico (Table 1). The error

reported for each sample was low, and the reliability was very high at
0.98. On an average scale of 1 to 100, women in the US assigned an average severity of 76.1 per item, which was significantly higher than the
average of 66.4 for women in Mexico (Table 2).
_Responses by Sampling Group and Type of Violence. Table 2 shows_
the average of the severity scores by sampling group and type of violence. For each sampled group, physical violence was ranked as most
severe, followed by sexual and then emotional violence. US women in
every group rated each type of violence as more severe than women in
Mexico. Differences were greatest for physical violence and smallest
for emotional violence, but most of these differences were not signifi

cant. Graduate students in the US, however, rated each type of violence
as significantly more severe than graduate students in Mexico. Women
in clerical positions in the US rated physical and emotional violence as
significantly more severe than their counterparts in Mexico, and women
in the participating clinics in the US rated physical violence as significantly more severe than women in participating clinics in Mexico.
Overall, group ratings within each country were similar. In the US,
graduate students and clerical workers had the highest severity ratings,
followed by clinic patients, professionals, and undergraduates. Women
in clerical positions had the highest severity scores for both physical
and emotional violence, but the lowest scores of all groups for sexual
violence. Undergraduates had the lowest severity scores for physical
and emotional violence, but had the second highest severity scores for
sexual violence. However, the only within-country contrast that reached
statistical significance was a higher rating for sexual violence among
graduate compared to professional women (p = .047).
In Mexico, undergraduates had the highest severity ratings, followed
by professionals, clinic patients, graduate students, then clerical workers. This pattern is almost directly opposite to the pattern in the US. Undergraduates had the highest ratings for sexual and emotional violence
and the second highest ratings for physical violence. Only two contrasts
reached statistical significance: undergraduates rated sexual violence as
significantly higher than graduates (p = 0.05); and professionals rated
physical violence as more severe than clinic patients (p = 0.04).
_Responses to Individual Items. Table 3 summarizes for each item the_
mean severity score on a scale of one to 100, the calibrated logit value,
and each item’s rank with one indicating the item ranked as most severe
by the Rasch model. For the calibrated logit values, increasing negative
values indicate increasing severity. Women in the US assigned a higher
average severity score than women in Mexico to 23 of the 26 domestic
abuse indicators, and among these 23 items 20 of the differences were
statistically significant. When adjusted by the Rasch model, calibrated
logit scores indicate that US women rated 24 of the 26 items as more severe than women in Mexico. Differences in comparisons between average and logit values occur because the calibrated values control for
respondent consistency. The logit values thus remove error due to aberrant or highly influential responses.
Women from both the US and Mexico ranked being shot with a gun
as the most severe event, although US women assigned this event a
higher severity value (US logit = 23.1; Mexico logit = 21.20). Being
attacked with a switchblade, knife, or machete was ranked as the second

_Peek-Asa et al._ _175_

most severe event in both countries, and US women again assigned a
higher severity value (US logit = 22.59; Mexico logit = 20.89). The
item with the third highest ranking among US women was being choked
(logit = 21.74) and among Mexican women was being threatened with
a gun (logit = 20.87).
A partner becoming jealous or suspicious of friends was ranked as
the least severe item by women in both countries, but this was one of
only two items with a higher severity value among women in Mexico
(US logit = 0.29; Mexico logit = 0.24). Being insulted by a partner was
ranked as the second least severe event among US women and was the
only other event to receive a higher severity value among women in
Mexico (US logit = 0.01; Mexico logit = 20.01). Mexican women
ranked a partner hitting a wall or furniture as the second least severe
event.
Being kicked by a partner led to the greatest difference in ranking.
Although this event was ranked as 5th most severe among Mexican
women but 12th most severe among US women, US women assigned a
higher severity value (US logit = 21.20; Mexico logit = 20.81). Items
with rank order differences of five or greater that were ranked as more
severe by Mexican than US women include being humiliated or scorned
(US rank = 23; Mexico rank = 17) and a partner demanding sex against
their partner’s will (US rank = 14; Mexico rank = 8). Items with rank order differences of five or greater but assigned a higher rank by US than
Mexican women include being hit in the abdomen (US rank = 6; Mexico rank = 12), being hit with a stick, belt, or domestic object (US rank =
6; Mexico rank = 10), and using physical force to have sex against their
partner’s will (US rank = 4; Mexico rank = 9). However, US women assigned a higher severity value for each of these items with differences in
rank order of five or more.
Figure 1 shows the calibrated Rasch logit scores from the US plotted
against those from Mexico. The solid diagonal line represents agreement in the severity value between the two countries. The calibrated
values which lie in the bottom right half of the graph indicate a higher
severity value among women in the US and those in the upper left indicate a higher severity value among women in Mexico. The figure
clearly demonstrates that women in the US consistently assigned higher
calibrated severity values to most of the items. The exceptions to this
trend are a partner who becomes jealous or suspicious of friends and being insulted.
The responses show a distinct linear trend represented by the dotted
line, which is a regression of the plotted values. This regression indi

cates that there is agreement among women in both countries in the relative ranking of severity among the items, but that as the perceived
severity increases, the calibrated value assigned by women in the US
becomes proportionately higher than those assigned by women in Mexico.

**_DISCUSSION_**


This survey indicates that women in the US perceived intimate partner violence indicators as more severe than women in Mexico, although
women in both countries generally ranked the items in similar patterns.
In each country, physical violence was perceived as the most severe,
followed by sexual and then emotional violence.
Overall, patterns of responses by the different groups of women were
similar between the two countries. The exceptions to this were graduate
students (in which US graduate students ranked each type of violence as
more severe than Mexican graduate students) clerical workers (in which


-----

_Peek-Asa et al._ _177_

US women rated physical and emotional violence as more severe), and
clinic patients (in which US women rated physical violence as more severe). Comparisons of group responses within countries showed very
few differences. These group patterns indicate that differences between
countries are not driven by any specific group, although graduate students may have the strongest role in predicting differences, and that
group responses within countries are consistent.
Intimate partner violence, as a public health issue, is not as widely
discussed among the general public in Mexico as it is in the US (Diaz
Olavarrieta and Sotelo, 1996: Ramirez Rodriguez and Patino Guerra,
1996). Investigators in Mexico have noted that the combination of a
scarcity of information and lack of recognition on behalf of public institutions have created an environment with little or no social supports for
victims (Bedregal et al., 1991; Duarte and Gonzaalez, 1994; Riiquer et
al., 1996). This lack of information could account in part for the large
variation in severity scores as well as lower perceptions of severity.
Los Angeles, with the largest Mexican population outside of Mexico
City, is highly influenced by Mexican social and cultural norms. Yet
these norms must mix with different public messages and a different
structure of social and health services. Health care and service providers
must take cultural beliefs and perceptions into account when assessing
and treating victims of abuse (Campbell et al., 2000; Spitz and Marks,
2000). Screening surveys and tools that are used in multicultural settings should be adequately calibrated to be appropriate for a range of
abuse perceptions. If one culture’s general set of beliefs assigns lower
severity to events indicating abuse, it is possible that health care providers may underestimate the actual level of abuse suffered by individuals.
For example, this study indicates that women from Mexico may perceive events of abuse as less severe, and in turn may report them as less
severe when responding to screening tools. One approach to sensitizing
such tools would be to set a range of thresholds indicating abuse which
can be adjusted according to known cultural perceptions of abuse.
Researchers and policymakers must also be aware of how cultural
contexts may affect responses to abuse and access of services. Women
from cultures that fail to recognize intimate partner violence as a public
health issue or that have a high tolerance for abuse against women may
be less likely to seek services. Providers should work within cultural
groups to find appropriate avenues to introduce interventions in these
populations, and information about the perceptions of abuse within cultural groups will aid in this process (Rodriguez, 1999).

This study includes a small sample of women from both sampled areas and cannot be generalized to all women. The sample was not randomly drawn, which further weakens the ability to extrapolate to larger
populations. These data do not represent regional variations within each
country. Although the sample is limited, this is the first systematic examination of differences in the perception of abuse among women. The
methodologic approach is appropriate for such a sample, and the Rasch
model indicates a high degree of internal validity and consistency
within the responses.
These findings indicate that there are differences in the overall perception of severity of abuse in the sample included in this study. Future
research within the Mexican and Mexican-American population, as
well as research including other cultural groups, would be valuable to
further describe the relationship between culture and perceptions of
abuse. Studies examining the relationship between acculturation, victimization, and perceptions of abuse could further clarify the role of culture in intimate partner violence.
