Abstract Prenatal depression (PD) as a risk factor for
adverse birth outcomes is well documented. Less is known
about maternal risks for PD, which could inform preventive
strategies for perinatal and interconceptional care. This
exploratory study investigates associations between prenatal depression symptoms and unintended and mistimed
pregnancies and other maternal risk factors for PD. A
subset of birth records from the New York Statewide
Perinatal Data System (n = 19,219) was used in this secondary analysis of cross-sectional data. Univariate and
multivariate multinomial regression was used to identify
factors that are independently associated with four selfreported levels of prenatal depression symptoms. Women
with unintended pregnancies were more likely (AOR, 95 %
CI) to report severe (3.6, 2.6–5.1) or moderate (2.0,
1.6–2.5) prenatal depression symptoms and less likely to
report no symptoms, compared to women with intended
pregnancies. Likewise, women with mistimed pregnancies
were more likely to report severe (2.7, 2.2–3.5) or moderate (1.7, 1.5–2.1) prenatal depression symptoms than no
symptoms, compared to women with intended pregnancies.
Low education, drug use, smoking, minority race, being
unmarried and having Medicaid insurance were also significant, independent predictors of PD symptoms. Results
suggest that routine screening for depression, intendedness

Introduction

Depression that begins during pregnancy is a prevalent
form of obstetric morbidity that elevates risk of poor
pregnancy outcomes, including slower fetal growth rates,
premature delivery and low birth weight [1–4]. One study
reported that women with prenatal depression (PD) had
13 % greater incidence of premature delivery (OR 2.61)
and 15 % greater incidence of low birth weight (OR 4.75)
than non-depressed women [2]. These adverse outcomes
may be mediated by stress and depression-induced
increases in cortisol and other changes in maternal and
infant body chemistry [2–4] and the adverse effects of
frequently co-occurring risks such as use of tobacco,
alcohol and other drugs and inadequate medical care that
are associated with prenatal depression [5]. Furthermore,
prenatal depression has been shown to be a strong predictor
of postpartum depression [6–9], which would extend and
compound risks for the developing infant and mother [10].

Prenatal depression is estimated to occur in 10–20 % of
pregnancies in the US [11, 12]. However, studies show that
only 18 % of pregnant women who meet criteria for
depressive disorders seek treatment during pregnancy and

postpartum [13]. Consequently, a majority of cases of
prenatal depression do not receive clinical treatment,
despite multiple visits to health care providers during
pregnancy. Prenatal depression is potentially modifiable,
especially when identified early in pregnancy [14–18].
Additional knowledge of risk factors for PD, increased
attention to modifiable factors and a preventive approach to
early identification of at-risk women by health care providers could reduce risks and morbidity attributable to
prenatal depression, and in some cases, to postpartum
depression as well.
Researchers have explored risk factors for depression
during pregnancy and have found numerous maternal
psychological, social, economic, demographic, health and
behavioral factors that have univariate associations with
prenatal depression [5, 19–21]. Unintended pregnancy has
been evaluated as an adjusted risk factor for prenatal
depression in a relatively small number of studies, but most
have shown a positive relationship between unintended
pregnancy and symptoms of PD [5, 6, 22–26]. A large,
nationally representative cohort study of more than 11,000
infants in Ireland found that unintended pregnancy was
associated with an increased risk of prenatal depression
(RR 1.36, 95 % CI 1.19–1.54) [25]. A cohort study of
1,600 US pregnancies revealed an association between
mid-pregnancy depression symptoms and unwanted pregnancy (OR 2.05, 95 % CI 1.12–3.75) [6]. Bunevicius et al.

[24] studied the prevalence of, and risk factors for prenatal
depression by trimester in a sample of Lithuanian women
and found a strong association between unintended and
unwanted pregnancies and prenatal depressive disorder in
all three trimesters, with AORs (95 % CI) ranging from
6.07 (1.64–22.46) to 15.35 (3.18–72.24).
This study investigates risk factors for prenatal depression, focusing on unintended and mistimed pregnancies. Our
study aim is to increase understanding of the effect of
pregnancy intendedness and other predictive factors on PD
symptoms through secondary analysis of a population-based
sample. For health care providers, more information about
who may be at elevated risk for prenatal depression is crucial
to planning and implementing preventive approaches to the
identification (via screening for depression, intendedness
and other associated risk factors) and treatment of depression
during all stages of reproductive health care.

Methods

The cross-sectional sample for our secondary analysis
included all women with recorded births of live infants in a
13-county region in central New York State during 2011
(N = 19,219). This region includes the cities of Watertown, Syracuse, and Binghamton NY, has a mix of urban,

suburban and rural populations, and has demographic and
socioeconomic profiles that are similar to much of the US.
Self-reported symptoms of depression during pregnancy,
pregnancy intendedness and a set of other potential predictor variables (Table 1) based on literature review and
availability were obtained from the New York Statewide
Perinatal Data System (SPDS) after receiving exempt status from the Institutional Review Board of SUNY Upstate
Medical University. The sample was chosen based on
convenient access to the data and because we thought it
was likely to be representative of many regions of the US.
The outcome of interest is a self-rated measure of severity
of depression symptoms during pregnancy with five levels:
‘not depressed at all’, ‘a little depressed’, ‘moderately
depressed’, ‘very depressed’, and ‘very depressed and had to
get help’. The latter two levels were combined for the statistical analyses, and the four categories of symptom severity
are hereafter referred to as ‘none’ (the referent category),
‘mild’, ‘moderate’ and ‘severe’. The SPDS measure of
depression symptoms was originally developed for use by
the Prenatal Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS)

[27], and has been field-tested and validated.


Within 72 h after delivery, women in this study were
asked via written survey to reflect back on their pregnancy
and self-rate their prenatal depression symptoms and their
desire/intention to become pregnant just before their latest
pregnancy, given the following choices: wanted to be
pregnant… ‘sooner’, ‘then’, ‘later’, and ‘not then or in the
future’ [27]. Responses for the first two categories were
combined for statistical analysis and the resulting three
categories are hereafter referred to as ‘intended’ (the referent category), ‘mistimed’ and ‘unintended’, respectively.
Of the original 19,219 SPDS records, 1,160 (6.0 %)
cases were excluded, including 825 (4.3 %) cases with a
missing outcome variable and 335 (1.7 %) with one or
more missing predictor variables. Comparisons of characteristics of women with missing and non-missing prenatal
depression symptoms were conducted using Chi square and
exact probability tests.
Non-collinearpotentialpredictorvariableswithunadjusted
odds ratios C1.5 (equivalent to r C 0.1, a ‘‘small’’ effect size

[28]) for prenatal depression in the univariate analyses were
selected for preliminary multivariate regression modeling
(Table 2). Predictor variables with non-significant (p C 0.05)
adjusted odds ratios in the preliminary multivariate models
were excluded from the final model (Table 3). All multivariate models used simultaneous entry of predictor variables.
All research was conducted in accordance with prevailing ethical standards. All statistical analyses used twotailed tests of significance, a priori a = 0.05 and 95 % CIs,
and were carried out using SPSS, Version 20.

Results

The prevalence of self-reported depression symptoms
during pregnancy and the set of potential risk factors
included in this study are summarized in Table 1. The
prevalence of self-reported levels of no symptoms, mild,
moderate and severe prenatal depression symptoms
was 70, 22, 6 and 2 %, respectively. About 62 % of
women reported that their pregnancy was intended, 30 %
reported it as mistimed and approximately 9 % said it was
unintended.
The univariate multinomial regression analysis identified a subset of the risk factors we evaluated (Table 1) that
met our criteria for preliminary multivariate analysis.
These variables are shown in Table 2. Variables in the final
model are shown in Table 3.

The adjusted odds ratios and 95 % CIs for predictive
variables retained in the final multinomial logistic regression model are presented in Table 3. Compared to women

with intended pregnancies, the adjusted odds (95 % CI for
AOR, 95 % CI for r, an effect size measure, p value) of
severe depressive symptoms (vs. no symptoms) were 3.6
(2.6–5.1, r = 0.25–0.41, p \ 0.001) times greater for
women with unintended pregnancies. Similarly, women
with mistimed pregnancies were 2.7 (2.0–3.5,
r = 0.19–0.33, p \ 0.001) times more likely to report
severe depression symptoms (vs. no symptoms) than were
women with intended pregnancies. We also observed
similar patterns of smaller, but significant AORs (ranging
from 1.7 to 2.0, r = 0.14–0.19, all p \ 0.001) for moderate
and mild depression symptoms (vs. no symptoms) associated with unintended and mistimed pregnancies, relative to
the odds for intended pregnancies.

Drug Use

Maternal drug use during pregnancy was also found to be
strongly associated with prenatal depression (Table 3).
Women whose medical records indicated prenatal use of
illicit drugs or non-prescribed medications were [AOR
(95 % CI)] 3.2 (2.2–4.5) and 1.5 (1.1–2.0) times more
likely to report severe and moderate depression symptoms
than no symptoms, respectively, when compared to women
with no known history of prenatal drug use.

Smoking

Compared to non-smokers, women who smoked during the
first trimester were more likely to report prenatal


depression symptoms than no symptoms, independent of
other risk factors (Table 3). For example, women who
reported smoking 20 or more cigarettes per day during the
first trimester were [AOR (95 % CI)] 3.1 (1.7–5.4) times
more likely to report moderate symptoms rather than no
symptoms of PD, compared to the non-smokers. Compared
to non-smokers, smoking as few as one to nine cigarettes
per day during the first trimester was a significant, independent predictor of an increased likelihood [AOR (95 %
CI)] of reporting mild 1.4 (1.2–1.5), moderate 1.9 (1.5–2.3)
or severe 1.7 (1.2–2.5) symptoms of PD, rather than no
symptoms.

Sociodemographic Factors

Adjusted relative odds for prenatal depression symptoms
vs. no symptoms were also generally higher for women
with lower levels of educational attainment (compared to
college graduates), for younger mothers (compared to older
mothers), for Hispanic and Black mothers (compared to
White mothers) and for those with Medicaid insurance
(compared to private or other insurance, Table 3).

Multiple Risks

Maternal risk factors for self-reported prenatal depression
symptoms and for poor pregnancy outcomes frequently cooccur in pregnant women. For example, 11.8 % of women
with unintended or mistimed pregnancies used drugs during pregnancy, 10 times the rate observed for intended

carrying an unintended or mistimed child. Nearly one-third
(30.7 %) of women with unintended pregnancies and
28.5 % of women with mistimed pregnancies smoked
during pregnancy; in contrast 13.9 % with intended pregnancies smoked during their pregnancy. Furthermore,
67.4 % of women known to use drugs during pregnancy
also smoked during pregnancy.
Comparisons of characteristics of women with missing
(vs. non-missing) prenatal depression symptoms found that
women with missing information about PD symptoms were
significantly more likely to be Black (11.4 % of missing
cases vs. 7.2 % of non-missing cases), be 35 years old or

and have unintended (12.6 vs. 8.6 %) or mistimed (37.9 vs.
29.2 %) pregnancies.

Discussion

Nearly 30 % of childbearing women in our sample reported some prenatal depression symptoms, which is higher
than the range of 10–20 % commonly reported in US
studies [11, 12, 29]. One possible explanation is that our
sample of US births is, in fact, a census of births in a
13-county region in central New York, and may capture
more women with prenatal depression than other (e.g.
facility-based) sampling methods. Alternatively, it could be
that women in this region have greater prevalence of PD


-----

than the norm. Another possible explanation is misclassification due to different instruments used to measure prenatal depression across studies; some portion of the women
who reported mild symptoms in our study might not be
classified as having depressive symptoms using other
depression screens. About 8 % reported moderate or severe
prenatal depression symptoms, which is in line with estimates of PD from other studies, and these women are the
focus of our findings. In addition, missing value analysis
for prenatal depression symptoms revealed that women
with missing information about PD symptoms tend to have
characteristics associated with elevated risk of moderate or
severe symptoms, which suggests that the prevalence of
moderate and severe symptoms may be greater than 8 % in
this population.
Our findings suggest an inverse association between
intendedness of pregnancy and symptoms of prenatal
depression, with 95 % CI estimates of AORs for severe PD
symptoms (referent: no PD symptoms) of 2.6–5.1
(r = 0.25–0.41) for unintended pregnancies (referent:
intended pregnancies) and 2.0–3.5 (r = 0.19–0.33) for
mistimed pregnancies (Table 3). Based on Cohen’s [28]
guidelines, the effect sizes we observed for the independent
(i.e., adjusted) relationship between pregnancy intendedness and severe depressive symptoms ranged from nearlymoderate to nearly-strong. Although Cohen’s guidelines
are meant to be interpreted in the context of other similar
studies (see below), we find it striking to observe these
levels of independent effects for pregnancy intendedness,
because prenatal depression is likely to be affected by a
complex combination of multiple interacting biological,
physiological, psychosocial and environmental factors.
Our findings are consistent with other reports [6, 24, 25],
in which AORs for depressive symptoms in unintended
pregnancy [AOR, (95 % CI for AOR, 95 % CI for r)]
varied between 1.36 (1.19–1.54, r = 0.05–0.13) and 15.35
(3.18–74.24, r = 0.30–0.76) times the odds for depressive
symptoms in intended pregnancies [24, 25]. It is interesting
that most of the studies of unintended pregnancy and risk
for prenatal depression show convergent results, because
they differ markedly in terms of study design, sampling
methods and populations, instruments used to measure
depressive symptoms and pregnancy intendedness, and in
the covariates controlled in the adjusted odds ratios [6, 21,
24, 25]. Replicated results under disparate conditions
suggest that the association between unintended and mistimed pregnancies and prenatal depression symptoms may
be relatively strong, consistent and insensitive to differences in methods and measures among studies.
There is evidence to suggest that women with unintended pregnancies have greater risk of adverse pregnancy
outcomes than women with intended pregnancies [1–4,
30–32]. Orr et al. [30] evaluated the association between


intendedness of pregnancy and preterm birth in a large
prospective cohort and found that unintended pregnancy
was significantly associated with preterm delivery
(adjusted RR 1.82, 95 % CI 1.08–3.08, p = 0.026).
Another study found that women who reported that their
pregnancies were unwanted had more than twice the risk
of infant mortality during the first 28 days following
delivery than women with intended pregnancies [31]. In a
case–control study, Sable et al. [32] showed that mothers
of very low birth weight infants were significantly more
likely to report that they had felt unhappy about the
pregnancy (OR 1.53) than those who had a normal-weight
baby.
It also appears that on the whole, women with unintended pregnancies and those with prenatal depression
share similar risk profiles for poor pregnancy outcomes. A
study of women with unintended or mistimed pregnancies
using PRAMS data found that compared to women with
intended pregnancies, mothers with unintended and mistimed pregnancies were more likely to consume less than the
recommended amount of preconception folic acid (AOR
2.4, 95 % CI 1.7–3.2), smoke prenatally (2.0, 1.5–2.9),
smoke postpartum (1.9, 1.4–2.6) and report postpartum
depression (2.0, 1.5–2.6) [33].
In addition, these women were less likely than women
with intended pregnancies to initiate prenatal care during
the first trimester (0.3, 0.3–0.5) and breastfeed for 8 or
more weeks (0.7, 0.6–1.0) [33]. In this study, we also found
a negative relationship between self-reported prenatal
depression symptoms and breastfeeding at hospital discharge; 39.4 % (650/1,561) of mothers with unintended
pregnancies were breastfeeding, while the comparable rates
for mothers with mistimed and intended pregnancies were
51.7 % (2,688/5,199) and 64.0 % (7,201/11,250), respectively (v[2] = 422.4, df = 2, p \ 0.001, V = 0.15). Similar
to the Cheng et al. study [33], other research confirms the
association between unintended or unwanted pregnancies
and continued smoking [34, 35]. Thus it appears that unintendedness, in and of itself, may signal a need for further
inquiry regarding history of other risk factors during prenatal care visits. We discuss using this signal in our
conclusions.
Consistent with many studies [5], we found that compared to mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy,
mothers who smoked during the first trimester of pregnancy were about 2–3 times more likely to report moderate
or severe symptoms of prenatal depression rather than no
symptoms (Table 3). There was also a strong trend towards
greater numbers of cigarettes smoked per day being associated with higher levels of depression symptoms
(Table 3).
It is well documented that maternal smoking during
pregnancy poses significant threats to the fetus and

## 1 3

developing infant. As cited and summarized in Roy et al.

[36], children of women who smoke during pregnancy
show ‘‘low birth weight [37], increased risk of stillbirth

[38], altered cardiorespiratory responses [39], and
increased asthma and wheezing [40] as well as behavioral
abnormalities, including increased evidence of attentional
deficits, impaired learning and memory, lowered IQ, and
cognitive dysfunction’’. Other studies have also revealed
that women who smoke during pregnancy may have
increased incidence of depression and thus reduced motivation to quit smoking during pregnancy [41]. Although
screening for smoking may be routine during the initial
prenatal visit, it may be frequently discussed in isolation
from other barriers to quitting that also adversely impact
pregnancy outcomes, such as unintended pregnancy, stress,
anxiety and depression. In our conclusions, we recommend
an integrated approach to risk screening and better coordinated interventions.
We also observed strong associations between drug use
and reported prenatal depression symptoms, after adjusting
for smoking and other predictive factors. Compared to
women not known to use drugs, women who did were 3.2
times more likely to report severe symptoms of depression
rather than no symptoms. Our findings are similar to other
reports regarding drug use and depression [5] and drug use
and intendedness [42, 43].
Other studies have demonstrated increased risk for
perinatal depression or prenatal depression symptoms
associated with low educational attainment [44, 45], Hispanic ethnicity [6] and Black race [46, 47]. We likewise
found that women with low education and Hispanic and
Black mothers are at increased risk for severe PD symptoms during pregnancy after controlling for intendedness
and other socioeconomic and behavioral factors (Table 3).

Limitations of this Study

The outcome variable is a measure of severity of depression symptoms during pregnancy, and is not a clinical
diagnosis of depression by a qualified practitioner. In
addition, it is based on a single question, unlike most
standard screening tools for depression, which have multiple questions and dimensions. Furthermore, prenatal
depression symptoms and pregnancy intendedness are selfreported measures that were collected after delivery, and
are therefore subject to recall bias [46, 47]. One source of
bias is that the birth outcome was known at the time of data
collection, which may influence a mother’s retrospective
assessment of intendedness and depression symptoms. In
addition, birth intendedness is a subjective concept that
may be influenced by social norms and stigma [48]. The
social bias is for women who did not want to get pregnant
to report they had wanted the pregnancy.

## 1 3


The use of data sets for secondary analysis—like birth
records—that are not designed around specific research
questions can result in incomplete information; for example, the SPDS data does not distinguish between chronic
depressive symptoms and symptoms originating in the
prenatal period. Furthermore, the distribution of unmeasured confounders could be unequally distributed among
childbearing women with and without symptoms of prenatal depression. Similarly, the results of our (and any)
regression modeling procedures may be sensitive to the
particular set of predictor variables that were included.
This study is also subject to the general limitations of
any cross-sectional study. The concurrent measurement of
predictive factors and prenatal depression symptoms precludes assessment of the temporal sequence between
exposures of interest and prenatal depression symptoms.
For example, we found strong relationships between intendedness of pregnancy, self-reported depressive symptoms, smoking and substance abuse. Although it was not
our aim, our cross-sectional study cannot assess causal
pathways and the temporal sequence of relationships
within this constellation of risk factors.
Central New York, like many regions and US states, has
a relatively small minority population compared to the US
as a whole. In our sample, Whites made up 80.7 % of the
birth mothers, whereas US birth mothers consisted of
54.4 % Whites and 45.6 % minorities in 2010 [49]. Lower
minority representation in our sample must be considered
when assessing the generalizability of our study results to
regions with larger proportions of minorities.

Strengths of This Study

This is the first study of pregnancy intendedness as a predictor of prenatal depression symptoms that uses a large,
population-based sample. Our study also uses validated and
field-tested PRAMS questions to measure self-reported
prenatal depression symptoms and pregnancy intendedness.
Except for underrepresentation of minorities, most
socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of our
sample are similar to the US profile of birthing mothers.
For example, 33.1 % of US birth mothers were 24 and
younger and 14.5 % were 35 and older in 2010 [49]. In our
sample, 34.4 % of mothers were 24 or younger and 11.7 %
were 35 and older. Our sample was also similar to the US
profile for education, smoking and use of WIC.
We also found that our estimate of the overall prevalence of moderate and severe PD symptoms is within range
of other published studies that used different methods,
instruments and facilities-based samples. Most importantly,
our findings on the association between intendedness and
prenatal depression symptoms and on other risk factors for
PD are entirely consistent with the results of longitudinal


-----

studies that measured depression symptoms using a variety
of standard screening tools (e.g. BDI-II, CES-D and EPDS)
throughout the course of the pregnancy and into the postpartum period. These replicated findings support the
validity of our results, despite the methodological limitations of the study. Both the similarity of our demographics
to US norms and consistency of our findings with published
results suggest that our population-based study may have
generalizable findings for many communities throughout
the US.

Future Directions

Although relatively few studies have examined unintended
pregnancy as an adjusted risk factor for prenatal depression, most of these studies, which vary substantially in size,
design and methods, have found unintended and mistimed
pregnancies to be risk factors for prenatal depression. This
study, like others, demonstrates substantial effect sizes for
the relationship between intendedness and depressive
symptoms while controlling for potential confounders.
Therefore, a reasonable next step would be to evaluate the
impact of a trial program that incorporates routine, repeated screening for depression and associated risks during
prenatal and interconceptional care, plus coordinated
interventions and support on the prevalence of PD, smoking and other risk behaviors, and unintended and mistimed
pregnancies. Future research should include prospective
studies of potential moderators of intendedness for prenatal
depression, such as race, cultural background, age and
socioeconomic status, in order to tailor interventions to
specific groups of women.

Conclusion

Our result suggest that unintended pregnancies may be a
signal that concealed co-morbidities and other risks for
adverse pregnancy outcomes may be present or emergent
during the course of the pregnancy. In order to effectively
intervene and increase the likelihood of positive outcomes
for current and future pregnancies, providers need to fully
understand the complex network of risks and mediators
affecting the mother and fetus, and seek to address them
using coordinated and integrated evidence-based
approaches.
The first step in effective intervention requires a fullyinformed provider; the results of this and other studies
indicate an urgent need to incorporate routine screening for
depression, intendedness and associated risk factors such as
smoking and substance abuse into standard protocols for all
prenatal care visits. Abbreviated versions of screening tools
are available and make screenings a feasible practice in


routine care; for example, a validated two-question
screening tool for depression was found to be feasible and
effective in clinical practice in several studies [50–54].
We also recommend a preventive approach to optimize
women’s health and readiness for a successful pregnancy
prior to conception. Preventive screening for risk factors
that might impact future pregnancies should be a routine
part of medical care for all women of reproductive age.
Interventions for smoking and drug use may be more
successful during preconceptional and interconceptional
life stages, when stress and anxiety may be lower than
during pregnancy. Depression too, is treatable and more
treatment options are available during preconceptional and
interconceptional stages than during pregnancy. Unintended and mistimed pregnancies may be addressed
through family planning consultation and contraception
services during the post-partum and interconceptional
periods to prevent recurrence. In summary, a preventive,
routine approach to risk evaluation and coordinated, evidence-based interventions for co-occurring risk factors
throughout a woman’s reproductive lifespan may help
reduce the burden that unintended pregnancies, maternal
depression and frequently co-occurring risks place on
newborn children in our communities.
