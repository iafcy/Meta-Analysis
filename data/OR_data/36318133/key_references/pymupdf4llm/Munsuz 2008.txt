# PregnancyIntentionandPretermBirth:Differential AssociationsAmongaDiversePopulationofWomen

CONTEXT: Studies published to date provide mixed evidence on the relationship between unintended pregnancy and
preterm birth, and none takeinto consideration that the meaning of unintended pregnancy may varyacross racial and
ethnic groups.

METHODS: Data from the 1999–2003 rounds of the Maternal and Infant Health Assessment, a population-based,
representative survey of postpartum women in California, were used to assess the relationship between pregnancy
intention and preterm birth. For racial and ethnic groups in which an association was found, sequential logistic
regression was conducted to further examine the relationship while controlling for socioeconomic characteristics.

RESULTS: In unadjusted results, pregnancy intention was associated with preterm birth among both whites and
immigrantLatinas,butnotamongblacksorU.S.-bornLatinas.Amongwhites,comparedwithwomenwhoreportedthat
their pregnancy was intended, those who were unsure about their pregnancy had elevated odds of preterm birth (odds
ratio, 1.4), as did those who reported their pregnancy was unwanted (1.7) or mistimed (1.4). Among immigrant Latinas,
those who reported being unsure about their pregnancy were at higher risk of preterm birth than were those who
reportedanintendedpregnancy(1.6).Afteradjustmentforsocioeconomicfactors,theassociationremainedsignificant
for immigrant Latinas who were unsure about their pregnancy (1.5), but none of the associations remained significant
for whites.

CONCLUSIONS: Women’s interpretations of questions about pregnancy intention and their social experiences
regarding pregnancy intention may vary by race or ethnicity. Studies on the association between pregnancy intention
and preterm birth may need to be group-specific.

Almost half (49%) of pregnancies in the United States are
unintended, and almost half of unintended pregnancies
end in abortion.[1] The demographic groups with the
highest rates of unintended birth generally are the poor,
those without a college education, those who are unmarried, those aged 20–24 years and minorities.[1] For example, unintended births occur at a rate of 58 births per
1,000 women among those with a family income below
the federal poverty level; this rate is 35 and 40 per 1,000
among black and Latina women, respectively, in comparison with 22 per 1,000 among all women in the United
States.[1]

Unintended pregnancy has repeatedly been shown to
be associated with a range of poor maternal and infant
health indicators, including preterm birth, low birth
weight and inadequate well-baby care, and with poor
social outcomes.[2–12] Preterm birth has extremely serious
adverseconsequences for infant mortality and both shortand long-term morbidity and development.[13–15] Unintended pregnancy might influence the risk of preterm
birth by modifying a woman’s psychological state—for
example, by contributing to depression or psychological
stress.[12,16–22] In addition, a woman who did not plan
a pregnancy might not be aware of one early on, and thus


might not engage in health-promoting maternal behaviors, such as cessation of smoking or harmful drug use, in
a timely manner.[2,3] However, studies published to date
provide mixed evidence on the relationship between
unintended pregnancy and preterm birth, and none take
into consideration that the meaning of unintended
pregnancy may vary across racial and ethnic groups.[23–25]

According to conventional classifications,[1,2] unintended pregnancies are ones that are mistimed (occur
earlier than wanted) or unwanted (not wanted at any
time). Estimates of unintended pregnancy rates are
usually based on retrospective reports, collected in
surveys some time after a birth or a pregnancy termination. However, a retrospective approach has inherent
limitations. Some research suggests that reported intentions become more positive with time after the child is
born,[26,27] while other research suggests that reports may
become more negative with time, reflecting a partner’s
and family’s reactions to the unexpected pregnancy.[28]

Furthermore, because unintended pregnancy rates differ
markedly by race and ethnicity, researchers have begun to
question the meaning of unintended pregnancy and,
consequently, its measurement across social groups of
women.[23–25,29–36]


-----

Qualitative studies suggest that the idea of planning
a pregnancy may have limited relevance for some groups
of women. A study that was based on in-depth interviews
with low-income black adolescent women in New
Orleans found an inconsistency between their expressed
desire to postpone pregnancy and their observed behavior, manifested in unintended childbearing. The researchers suggest that the interplay between community
acceptance of teenage pregnancy, limited socioeconomic
opportunities, and imperfect knowledge of and access to
reproductive health care may make it difficult for young
black women to realize their intentions.[24,25] Barrett and
Wellings, who conducted in-depth interviews with a diverse group of women in London, suggest that a planned
pregnancy is a somewhat idealized goal, regardless of
women’s socioeconomic status. According to those interviewed, achieving a planned pregnancy requires that
women deliberately decide to become pregnant, temporarily discontinue any contraceptive use, be in agreement
with their partner and reach the right time in terms of
lifestyle or life stage.[30] Indeed, even for women who
believe they have control over any one of these factors,
having control over all of them simultaneously presents
an even greater challenge.

PREGNANCY INTENTION AND PRETERM BIRTH
It is important to consider the findings of studies on the
associations between pregnancy intention and preterm
birth in light of the potentially varied meaning of pregnancy intention across social groups of women. A prospective study of 434 women receiving prenatal care in
Belgium found a positiveassociation between unintended
pregnancy and preterm birth after adjustment for women’s medical risk status and socioeconomic status,
although this study did not use the conventional intendedness classifications.[7] A prospective study of 922 lowincome black women recruited at prenatal clinics in
Baltimore found a positive association between unintended pregnancy, using the conventional classification,
and preterm birth after other medical risk factors were
adjusted for.[8] Another study, using 1995 National Survey
of Family Growth (NSFG) data, found a higher risk of
preterm birth among women whose pregnancies were
mistimed by two years or more than among those who
had intended pregnancies.[9]

On the other hand, three clinic-based studies found no
evidence of an association between preterm birth and
unintended pregnancy. One included 1,908 women (the
majority of whom were white) in North Carolina,[12] one
was conducted among 416 low-income black women in
Harlem[10] and one involved 1,404 women recruited from
a prenatal clinic in northwestern Russia.[11]

Furthermore, other studies have shown that the association between unintended pregnancy and other maternal, infant and child health outcomes diminishes and
sometimes disappears after adjustment for maternal
socioeconomic variables.[3,4,6] All of these studies were


based on data sets with relatively extensive socioeconomic information (e.g., the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth), and used multiple socioeconomic
variables, including mother’s family structure at age 14,
receipt of public assistance, mother’s education, mother’s
labor force status and family income. The studies discussed above, however, had little information on socioeconomic status, and all but one relied on data from
prenatal clinics; these facts limit the ability to assess
potential confounding and generalizability.
The current study was conducted to examine the
relationship between unintended pregnancy and preterm birth in a large, population-based sample of racially
and ethnically diverse postpartum women with more
extensive socioeconomic information than has been
available in prior studies. Specifically, the analysis investigates the following research questions: Is unintended
pregnancy associated with preterm birth among the
general population of childbearing women and among
childbearing women of different racial and ethnic groups
in California? If so, do socioeconomic factors confound
the relationship?

METHODS
StudyDesign
We used five years (1999–2003) of data from the
California Maternal and Infant Health Assessment
(MIHA). MIHA, a collaborative project of the state
health department’s Maternal and Child Health/Office
of Family Planning Branch and the University of
California, San Francisco, is an annual survey of women
having live births in California from February through
May; its data are linked with birth certificate data, which
provide the sampling frame. Women are eligible to
participate in MIHA if they are English- or Spanishspeaking state residents; are 15 or older; had singleton,
twin or triplet births; and had addresses recorded on
birth certificates. The sample is stratified according to
region in California and woman’s education and race or
ethnicity, and selected randomly from within those
strata; blacks are oversampled. Approximately 3,500
women are interviewed each year, and the sample is
representative of the more than 150,000 women who
give birth in California during the four-month assessment period.
MIHA includes a range of questions on maternal and
infant health and maternal socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Surveys in English and Spanish
are mailed to women 10–14 weeks after they have given
birth; two weeks after the initial mailing, reminder postcards are sent to nonrespondents, and three weeks after
the reminders, a second mailing of questionnaires is sent.
Telephone contact is attempted with nonrespondents
and those whose surveys are returned because of incorrect addresses. In 1999–2003, surveys were completed 2–
7 months after the surveys were mailed. Questionnaires
were completed by mail for about 75% of respondents


-----

and by telephone for about 25%; 75% of the surveys were
completed in English, and 25% in Spanish.
In 1999–2003, a total of 17,725 women completed the
MIHA survey. The response rate was 72% overall, but was
somewhat lower (63–68%) among subgroups who traditionally areless likelythan average toparticipate in mail or
telephone surveys (those with less than a high school
education, black women and Latina women born outside
the United States). However, the maternal characteristics
of the sample are similar to those of all eligible women
who gave birth statewide (information available upon
request).
A survey question combining race and ethnicity was
used in conjunction with birth certificate information on
birthplace to create seven mutually exclusive racial and
ethnic group categories: black, U.S.-born Asian, immi

grant Asian, U.S.-born Latina, immigrant Latina, Native
American and white. There were too few immigrant
blacks or immigrant whites to examine separately.
U.S.-born Asians and Native Americans were excluded
from selected analyses because sample sizes were small;
immigrant Asians were excluded because the sample
likely was not representative, as the survey was not
translated into any Asian languages. White women made
up the largest proportion of the sample, followed by
immigrant Latinas, U.S.-born Latinas and blacks. The
analysis was limited to women reporting singleton births,
as women with multiple births have a different risk profile
for preterm birth.[37,38] The final sample size for the
primary analyses was 15,331; women who did not report
race or ethnicity and those who were Asian or Native
American were excluded.

StudyVariables
From birth certificate data on gestational age, we identified women who had a preterm birth, defined as a birth at
less than 37 weeks of gestation. We used several measures
to reflect socioeconomic status: educational attainment of
the woman and of her baby’s father, and family income (as
a percentage of the federal poverty level, which was estimated using published guidelines from the U.S. Census
Bureau for the relevant year[39]). Because both young age at
first birth and single parenthood have repeatedly been
associated with socioeconomic disadvantage,[2] we also
included the relevant demographic variables: maternal
age, parity and marital status.
The main independent variable is pregnancy intention,
defined with four categories—intended, mistimed,
unwanted and unsure. Because mistimed and unwanted
pregnancies might be qualitatively distinct and might
have differential impacts on pregnancy outcomes,[2,9,33]

intention status was analyzed as a four-category variable
(intended vs. mistimed vs. unwanted vs. unsure), as
opposed to a dichotomous variable (unintended vs.
intended).[9] The following MIHA question (modeled on
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System and
NSFG questions) was used to construct the pregnancy
intention measure: ‘‘Thinking back to just before you got
pregnant, how did you feel about getting pregnant?’’
Response choices are ‘‘I wanted to get pregnant then’’
(indicating that the pregnancy was intended), ‘‘I wanted
to get pregnant later’’ (it was mistimed), ‘‘I didn’t want to
get pregnant then or in the future’’ (it was unwanted) and
‘‘I wasn’t sure what I wanted.’’ Consistent with other
research utilizing MIHA data, women who reported that
their pregnancy was mistimed or unwanted or that they
were unsure about their pregnancy were classified as
having an unintended pregnancy;[40] our definition is
modeled after the conventional definition but also includes ‘‘unsure’’ responses.

AnalyticApproach
MIHA data were statistically weighted so that results can
be generalized to the statewide population of eligible
women with live births in the years 1999–2003. We used
SAS[41] to describe sample characteristics and SUDAAN[42]

to construct logistic regression models. Unadjusted odds
ratios examining predictors of preterm birth (with 95%
confidence intervals) were calculated first among all
women and then within each racial and ethnic group.
Racial and ethnic groups in which preterm birth was
associated with unintended pregnancy were further
analyzed through sequential multiple regression. Each
model in these analyses added one of the following
variables to the unadjusted model: family income, respondent’s education, paternal education, age, parity and
marital status. We examined changes in odds ratios and
95% confidence intervals and log-likelihood ratio tests for
each model to assess how the addition of each variable
affected the associations and to assess the practical


significance of the contribution of each variable to each
successive model. We also constructed a full model that
adjusted for all socioeconomic factors related to preterm
birth. (Models in which there were no significant associations are not shown.)

RESULTS
SampleCharacteristics
Overall, 9% of women in this sample had a preterm birth;
theproportionrangedfrom8%amongwhiteandU.S.-born
Asian women to 14–15% among blacks and Native Americans (Table 1). Thirteen percent of the women reported
being unsure about pregnancy intention, 9% reported that
their pregnancies were unwanted and 25% reported that
their pregnancies were mistimed. In total, 46% of these
pregnancies were unintended. The proportion of women
reporting unintended pregnancy ranged from 38% among
white women to 59–66% among U.S.-born Latinas, Native
Americans and black women.
The proportion of women who were college graduates
ranged from 5% among immigrant Latinas to 52% among
immigrant Asians. Among U.S. born-Latinas, 23% of
births were among women aged 15–19; 2% of births
among immigrant Asians were to women in this agegroup. Finally, the proportion of women reporting being
unmarried ranged from 13% among immigrant Asians to
65% among blacks.

OddsofPretermBirthbyRacialorEthnicGroup
Women who did not intend their pregnancy had an
elevated likelihood of preterm birth (Table 2, page 69).
Compared with those whose pregnancy was intended,
women who were unsure about their pregnancy were at
higher risk of preterm birth (odds ratio, 1.4), as were
those reporting their pregnancy as unwanted (1.4) or
mistimed (1.2). The risk of preterm birth was associated
with unintendedness among white women (unsure, 1.4;
unwanted, 1.7; and mistimed, 1.4) and among immigrant
Latinas (unsure, 1.6), but not among black or U.S.-born
Latina women. Thus, multivariate analyses are presented
only for whites and immigrant Latinas.
Among white women, adjustment for income alone had
the greatest effect on the likelihood of preterm birth,
resulting in nonsignificant odds ratios for all categories of
pregnancy intention (Table 3). With the addition of
maternal education, paternal education or marital status,
the relationship between unintended pregnancy and
preterm birth was attenuated: Women who reported an
unwanted pregnancy—but not those who reported being
unsure about the pregnancy or those who considered
their pregnancy mistimed—were at higher risk of preterm
birth than were women who reported an intended
pregnancy (odds ratio, 1.5 in each model). Adding age
or parity did not influence the observed association


between any of the pregnancy intention categories and
preterm birth risk, and did not make a significant contribution to the model with pregnancy intention alone,
according to the log-likelihood ratio test (not shown).
Adjusting for all socioeconomic factors simultaneously
resulted in nonsignificant odds ratios for all categories of
pregnancy intention among white women.
Adjustment for individual socioeconomic factors did
not appreciably influence the association between pregnancy intention and preterm birth among immigrant
Latina women (Table 4). However, adjustments for
maternal education, paternal education, age, marital
status and parity made significant contributions to variation in preterm birth risk, according to the log-likelihood
ratio tests. After adjustment for all socioeconomic factors
simultaneously, immigrant Latina women who reported
being unsure about their pregnancy remained at an
increased risk of preterm birth (odds ratio, 1.5).

DISCUSSION
Utilizing population-based information from a diverse
sample of postpartum women in California, our study
demonstrates that the relationship between pregnancy
intention and preterm birth varies by women’s racial or
ethnic group.After adjustment for the socioeconomic and
demographic variables in our study, pregnancy intention

was significantly related to preterm birth among immigrant Latinas, but not among white, black or U.S.-born
Latina women. These findings both conflict with and
support previous studies that found that the association
between unintended pregnancy and other maternal and
infant health outcomes disappeared after adequate
adjustment for socioeconomic factors.[3–6] The unique
pattern observed among immigrant Latinas suggests that
the socioeconomic factors we measured may play different roles in relation to pregnancy intention and preterm
birth for different groups of women. This finding is
consistent with the poorly understood but widely
observedparadoxof good birth outcomes among Latinas,
despite high levels of socioeconomic disadvantage.[43–47]

Limitations
Several limitations of this study should be noted. First,
our study is cross-sectional, limiting our ability to make
causal inferences about the relationship between unintended pregnancy or socioeconomic factors and preterm
birth. Another limitation, noted earlier, is the retrospective measurement of unintended pregnancy, which can be
resolved only with a longitudinal study design. Similarly,
although our measure of preterm birth came from birth
certificates, it was based in part on the mother’s report of
her last menstrual period, which may be subject to


reporting error.[48,49] Further, despite the large sample
size overall, we had insufficient numbers of Native
American and U.S.-born Asian women for analysis, and
our sample of Asian immigrants may not have been
representative of this population statewide. Also, we
focused on socioeconomic factors that might confound
the relationship between unintended pregnancy and
preterm birth; other, unmeasured determinants of preterm birth may also vary by racial or ethnic group.
In interpreting this study’s findings, it is important to
keep in mind that we analyzed data only on pregnancies
ending in live births (as did the studies of preterm birth
discussed previously). In a setting where abortion is legal
and largely accessible, as it is here in the United States,
one could argue that women with truly unwanted pregnancies obtain abortions.[50] To the extent that abortion is
safe and accessible, analyses of live births involve only
a subset of unintended pregnancies—those on the ‘‘more
desirable’’ end of the spectrum. Abortions that are denied
to women, however, can have the most serious consequences for mother and child. In fact, longitudinal
European studies of women who had abortion requests
denied have found severe negative effects on the
children’s long-term psychosocial development.[51,52]

Where abortion is illegal and unsafe, unintended pregnancy is a major contributor to maternal morbidity and


-----

mortality.[53,54] In our study, the exclusion of terminated
pregnancies may explain both the differential association
and the lack of association between unintended pregnancy ending in live births and preterm birth, given that
abortion rates vary by racial or ethnic group.[1]

Conclusion
These findings have several important implications for
research, as well as for program and policy development.
Theycall into question the belief in an association between
unintended pregnancy and preterm birth, at least among
certain racial and ethnic groups, and they suggest that
studies of pregnancy intention and preterm birth cannot
be generalized across racial or ethnic groups, perhaps
because of variations across groups in social experiences.
Our findings also add to concerns about the measurement
and meaning of unintended pregnancy, particularly
among diverse populations. Although the varied meanings of the conventional pregnancy intention categories
have been explored qualitatively,[24,30] more research is
needed, particularly among immigrant Latina women.
Longitudinal investigations of how pregnancy intentions
might change over time, whether the direction of change
varies by racial or ethnic group or by socioeconomic
factors, and how pregnant women’s social and health care
context shapes their stated intentions would seem promising.Suchinquiriescouldhelpusachievea morenuanced
understanding of women’s pregnancy goals and desires,
which in turn could inform the development of alternative
and more meaningful measures of pregnancy intention.
To the extent that our study suggests an association
between socioeconomic factors and the risk of preterm
birth, programs and policies need to address women’s
socioeconomic conditions to have an impact on their risk
of preterm birth. To the extent that the current understanding of pregnancy intention has meaning and implications for maternal and infant health, efforts should be
made to ensure women’s access to reproductive health
care, including by preserving public health safety net
measures for immigrants, to have an impact on both
women’s fertility goals and their risk of preterm birth.
