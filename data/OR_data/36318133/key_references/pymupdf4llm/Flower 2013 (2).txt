Abstract

Background: Pre-pregnancy health and care are important for the health of the future generations. Smoking
during pregnancy has been well-researched and there is clear evidence of harm. But there has been little research
on the health impact of planning for pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the independent effects of
pregnancy planning and smoking during pregnancy on neonatal outcome.

Methods: This analysis made use of data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. The study sample consisted of
18,178 singleton babies born in UK between 2000 and 2001. The neonatal outcomes of interest were low
birthweight (<2.5 Kg) and pre-term birth (<37 completed weeks gestation). Logistic regression was used to estimate
the association between pregnancy planning and/or smoking and neonatal outcome. Adjusted odds ratios were
used to calculate population attributable risk fractions (PAFs).

Results: 43% of mothers did not plan their pregnancy and 34% were smoking just before and/or during
pregnancy. Planners were half as likely to be smokers just before pregnancy, and more likely to give up or reduce
the amount smoked if smokers. Unplanned pregnancies had 24% increased odds of low birth weight and
prematurity compared to planned pregnancies (AORLBW1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.48; AORPREM1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45),
independent of smoking status. The odds of low birth weight for babies of mothers who were smoking just before
pregnancy was 91% higher than that of mothers who were not (AORLBW1.91, 95% CI 1.56-2.34). Women who quit
or reduced the amount smoked during pregnancy lowered the risk of a low birth weight baby by one third
(AORLBW0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.85) compared with women whose smoking level did not change. Smaller effects were
found for prematurity. If all women planned their pregnancy and did not smoke before or during pregnancy, 30%
of low birthweight and 14% of prematurity could, in theory, be avoided.

Conclusions: Planning a pregnancy and avoiding smoking during pregnancy has clear, independent, health benefits
for babies. Quitting or reducing the amount smoked during pregnancy can reduce the risk of low birthweight.

health professionals for interventions to help women
and partners to quit smoking including carbon monoxide
testing and referral to smoking cessation services.
The NHS guidance also gives advice on how long it is
expected for a woman to become pregnant and what options there are for fertility treatment if there are difficulties
in becoming pregnant [4]. But there is no information on
the health impact of pregnancy planning itself, reflecting
the fact that there has been little research on decisions
made by a woman before pregnancy and how that affects
health related behaviours and the health of the child. Such
information is important if interventions to improve
neonatal outcome by preparing for pregnancy are to be
initiated, and these interventions may need to be targeted
towards particular groups who are less likely to plan
for pregnancy.
This study uses Millennium cohort data to examine the
independent effects of pregnancy planning and smoking
during pregnancy on neonatal outcome. Specific objectives
were to (i) examine the association between planning
and smoking status, and (ii) examine the independent
effects of pregnancy planning and smoking status on
neonatal outcome, and (iii) estimate the proportion of
adverse neonatal outcome that could be avoided in the
population if all mothers planned their pregnancies
and / or avoided smoking in pregnancy.

Methods
The millennium cohort study
The MCS is a nationally representative cohort study
conducted by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at the
[Institute of Education, London (http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/),](http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/)
that follows the lives of over 18,819 babies born throughout Great Britain and Northern Ireland between 2000 and
2001 [10] a&b. The MCS first collected information on
the babies and their families from their two main carers
(most commonly their mother and father) when the babies were around nine months old. The MCS attained an
overall response rate of 68% throughout the whole of the
UK [10] a&b. As part of the survey design the MCS oversampled in areas with high child poverty and in England
also in areas with increased prevalence of ethnic minority
populations [10] b.

Pregnancy planning and smoking in pregnancy
The two main exposure variables were pregnancy planning
and smoking status, which were asked about at the first
interview when the child was 9 months of age. Pregnancy
planning information came from the question to the
mother “Were you planning to get pregnant or was it a
surprise?” Women were grouped into those who planned,
and those who did not plan, the pregnancy. Smoking status
during pregnancy came from questions about current and
past smoking, including the question “How many cigarettes


a day were you usually smoking just before you became
pregnant?” and “Did you change the amount you smoked
during your pregnancy?” All women who reported a change
had a reduction in the amount smoked. Women were
classified as smokers just before pregnancy if they reported 1 or more cigarettes per day. For the analysis,
four categories of smoking status during pregnancy were: (i)
never-smoker; (ii) ex-smoker (given up before pregnancy);
(iii) smoker just before pregnancy and had either quit smoking or had reduced the amount smoked during pregnancy;
and (iv) smoker just before pregnancy and continued to
smoke the same amount during pregnancy (no change).

Neonatal outcome
The outcome variables were low birthweight (less than
2.5 Kg or 2.5 Kg and above) and pre-term birth (<37 completed weeks or 37 or more completed weeks gestation).

Study population
This analysis investigated singleton births only. Records
of babies from multiple births and corresponding carer
information were dropped from the analysis (n = 522). A
further 18 records were dropped from the analysis because
the respondents were not immediate family members. 100
records had missing information on pregnancy planning,
and 816 records had missing smoking information, leaving
a total of 18,178 records with planning information and
17,462 records with smoking information. Further records
(less than 145) with missing data on socio-economic
characteristics and neonatal outcome were dropped from
analyses, as appropriate: the numbers in each analysis are
presented in the tables.

Statistical analysis
Data for this analysis were taken from the first sweep only,
accessed through the Economic and Social Data Service
[(http://www.esds.ac.uk/). All analyses used the statistical](http://www.esds.ac.uk/)
software package STATA, version 11. The survey design,
oversampling and response rate were accounted for using
the svyset command (and subsequent svy commands)
in STATA using specific countrywide variables that had
already been created.
Socio-demographic characteristics and the health status
of women who planned, and did not plan, the index
pregnancy were compared using descriptive tabulations
and Chi square tests. Similar comparisons were made for
women in the four smoking groups.
Univariable logistic regression was used to investigate
the association between pregnancy planning, or smoking
status, and neonatal outcome. Multivariable analysis was
then conducted, including confounding variables in the
model if they were associated with the outcome at a 5%
level after adjustment for other factors in the model. Effect modification between planning and smoking status

was investigated using Likelihood Ratio Tests (ignoring the
SVY command). If no interaction was detected (p > 0.05)
further adjustment was made for smoking status or
planning, as appropriate.
Adjusted population attributable risk fractions (PAFs)
were used to assess the independent impact of pregnancy
planning and smoking on low birthweight and preterm
delivery in this population. PAFs were computed using
for formula:

p AORð ‐1Þ
PAF %ð Þ ¼ x 100
P AORð ‐1Þ þ 1

Where: p = proportion of population who did not plan
their pregnancies/ or who smoked around the time of
pregnancy, and AOR = Adjusted odds ratio.
PAFs to estimate the joint impact of pregnancy planning
and smoking were calculated using the method described
in Bruzzi et all, 1985 [11].

Results
Characteristics of the study population by planning and
smoking status
Overall, 57% (10,405/18,178) of mothers of singleton births
reported that they planned the pregnancy (Additional file 1:
Table S1). Compared to planners, non-planners were
younger and left school at an earlier age, were more likely
to be classified as deprived, and less likely to be married
and to have White ethnicity. The babies who were not
planned were of higher birth order than babies who were
planned and there was some indication that mothers who
reported not planning their pregnancy were more likely to
be underweight before pregnancy than women who did
plan (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Fifty four percent (9,370/17,462) of mothers had never
smoked and 12% (n = 2,071) were ex-smokers. Thirty four
percent were smokers just before the pregnancy and, of
these, 81% quit or decreased the amount they smoked
during the course of the pregnancy (Additional file 2:
Table S2). Compared to the non-smokers, smokers were
younger and left school at an earlier age, were more
likely to be classified as deprived, and less likely to be
married. Again, there was some evidence that mothers
who smoked around the time of the pregnancy were
more likely to be underweight before pregnancy than
women who did not smoke. Babies of mothers who continued to smoke in pregnancy had higher birth order
than babies born to mothers in the other three smoking
groups (Additional file 2: Table S2).

Association between smoking and planning a pregnancy
There was a clear association between planning a pregnancy
and not smoking just before pregnancy (p < 0.001, Table 1).
Of the planners, 62% were never smokers, 12% ex-smokers


and 26% were smoking just before pregnancy. The corresponding figures for mothers who did not plan their
pregnancy were 46% never-smokers, 7% ex-smokers and
47% smoking just before pregnancy. Of those smoking
just before pregnancy, 84% of the planners and 77% of the
non-planners either quit smoking or reduced the amount
they smoked in pregnancy (Table 1).

Association between pregnancy planning, smoking in
pregnancy, and neonatal outcome
Overall, 6% (1,102/18,178) of babies in the study population
were born with low birthweight and 7% (n = 1,279) were
born preterm.

Pregnancy planning
The proportion of low birthweight babies was lower
for mothers who planned their pregnancy (5.2%) than
for mothers who did not plan (7.2%). After adjusting
for socio-demographic confounding factors (see table
footnotes for details of adjustment factors) there was a
statistically significant 27% increased odds of low birthweight for the children of mothers who did not plan compared to those who did (AOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.06-1.51)
(Table 2). No effect modification between pregnancy
planning and smoking was detected (p > 0.05). After
further adjustment for smoking status, effect of planning
reduced slightly to 24% increased odds (AOR 1.24, 95% CI
1.04-1.48), remaining statistically significant. Similarly,
6.3% of children whose mothers planned their pregnancy
were born prematurely, compared to 8.2% of children
whose mothers did not, with adjusted odds ratios showing
24% increased odds of prematurity associated with nonplanning (AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45).

Smoking
The proportion of babies with low birthweight was higher
for mothers who smoked just before pregnancy (8.3%)
than for those who did not (5.0%). After adjustment for
socio-demographic factors (see table footnotes for details)
and pregnancy planning (no effect modification between
smoking and pregnancy planning detected, p > 0.05), there
was a statistically significant 91% increased odds of low
birthweight associated with smoking before pregnancy
(AOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.56-2.34) (Table 3). A smaller effect was seen for prematurity, the adjusted odds ratio
showing 12% increased odds associated with smoking
(AOR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95-1.35).
Further analysis of neonatal outcome for the children
of mothers who reported smoking just before pregnancy
showed that those mothers who quit or decreased the
amount smoked during pregnancy had a lower proportion
of low birthweight babies (7.6%) compared to mothers
who continued to smoke the same amount in pregnancy (11.5%). After adjustment for confounding factors,

including pregnancy planning, the odds of low birthweight
for babies born to mothers who changed their smoking
habits during pregnancy were reduced by 34% (AOR 0.66,
95% CI 0.51-0.85) (Table 4). A smaller and non-statistically
significant effect of quitting or decreasing the amount
smoked during pregnancy was seen for prematurity
(AOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.67-1.09).

Population attributable risk fractions
Figure 1 presents the hypothetical proportion of adverse
outcome that could be avoided if we assume that all
women in this population planned their pregnancies, or
no women smoked around the time of pregnancy, or
both. Over 20% of low birthweight, and 4% of prematurity
could have been avoided if no women smoked during
and/or just before pregnancy. For pregnancy planning, the
potential saving was a further 10% of both low birthweight
and prematurity. The combined savings if all women
planned and no women smoked, was almost 30% of
low birthweight and 14% of prematurity.

Discussion
Main findings
Not surprisingly, those women who planned their pregnancy were less likely to smoke than those for whom the
pregnancy was a surprise. However, there was strong evidence for an association between planning a pregnancy and
neonatal outcome which was independent of smoking status. Surprise pregnancies had almost one quarter increased
risk of low birth weight and prematurity compared to pregnancies which were planned after allowing for differences
in smoking. Smoking just before pregnancy had a stronger association with low birthweight, smokers having
over 90% increased risk of low birthweight compared


to non-smokers. For those who were smoking just before
pregnancy, giving up or reducing the amount smoked had
a clear beneficial effect on low birthweight, risks being
reduced by just over one third. These effects were independent of planning status and other health behaviours
measured in this cohort. We estimated that, in theory,
30% of low birthweight, and 14% of premature births,
could have been avoided in this population if all women
planned their pregnancies and were non-smokers around
the time of pregnancy.

Strengths and limitations
This analysis used data from a large, nationally representative, UK cohort study. The size provided the study with
good statistical power and the data contained information
on potential confounding factors with a low proportion of
missing information. However, as the information was
collected nine months post birth there is likely to be
some information bias as respondents were asked to
recall events up to two years before they were interviewed.
Self-reported smoking habits, in particular, is vulnerable
to underreporting [12]. Although we are reassured to some
extent that the rates of pre-pregnancy smoking were similar
to national rates for 2000 reported elsewhere [13], we need
to assess the impact of underreporting of smoking during
pregnancy on our findings. If under reporting of smoking
during pregnancy was similar in those with and without a
low birthweight or preterm baby the effect would be to bias
the measure of effect towards a null effect. It is thus unlikely to be an explanation for the smoking effects seen in
these data. However, since the outcome of pregnancy was
known at the time the questions on smoking were asked,
we have to consider the possibility that underreporting
of smoking status during pregnancy could be different

for those with, and without, a low birthweight/preterm
baby. For differential under-reporting of smoking habits to
explain the findings reported here, under-reporting would
have to be less likely (reporting being more accurate) for
mothers with low birthweight/preterm babies compared
to that for mothers with babies not low birthweight/
preterm. We have no way of checking this with available
data, and differential under-reporting of smoking during
pregnancy may explain some of the effects reported here.
The MCS also only obtained information on babies that
had survived to roughly nine months. A subsequent investigation estimated that 180 babies did not survive to nine
months of age and so were not able to be surveyed [14].
Four percent of records also had missing smoking data.
Since death and smoking are related to lowbirthweight
and prematurity, missing data of this type may have resulted in an underestimation of the effect of smoking
on lowbirthweight and smoking in this analysis.
Part of this research compared smokers who changed
their behaviour and those who did not. There may have
been some women in the no change group who continued
to smoke a relatively little amount, and those in the group
that changed their smoking behaviour who still smoked a
comparatively large amount, for example if they cut down
from 40 cigarettes per day to 10. We did not examine
amounts smoked in this analysis. However, such misclassification of exposure would tend to bias the measure of effect
towards the null, making our findings conservative rather
than inflated.


Interpretation
The characteristics of women in the MCS who planned, or
did not plan, their pregnancies, and who smoked, or not,
just before pregnancy has been reported before [15,16]. As
expected, we found similar socio-economic distributions
for these sub-groups within the MCS population. However,
what is unique in the current - analysis is examination of
the relationship between planning and smoking, and their
independent effects on neonatal outcome.
While it may seem intuitive that unplanned pregnancies
would be associated with poorer neonatal outcomes, the
literature on this question is not extensive and is somewhat conflicting. One of the main reasons for this is the
issue of adjustment for confounding factors including a
range of health-seeking behaviours that may be associated
with pregnancy planning but independently related to
birth outcomes, such as good antenatal care.
Studies of women who plan compared to those who
do not have investigated the effect on health related behaviours such as smoking, alcohol consumption, folic acid
supplementation and antenatal care attendance. A study
of Turkish - pregnant women interviewed in an antenatal
setting found that 71% planned their pregnancy and they
were less likely to smoke, have lower alcohol consumption, go to more antenatal sessions and take more supplementation and nutrition compared to those who did not
plan [17]. The effect of planning a pregnancy appeared
beneficial in this study, but a Swedish study found only 20%
of women planning their pregnancy took folic acid during

the period in which they were planning [18]. A Canadian
study found a similar level of 28% of women who planned
took folic acid supplementation [19]. In both the latter two
studies, folic acid supplementation was more common
in those who planned, compared to those who did not
plan, their pregnancy, but the percentage falls far short
of optimum coverage of folic acid supplementation before
and during pregnancy.
Green-Raleigh et al found that women who were planning to get pregnant were more likely to decrease their
consumption, or abstain, from alcohol [20]. The study also
found that women planning to get pregnant were less
likely to be smokers, [20] as we found in the current study.
Another study which looked at the effect of planning in
adolescents, found that those who planned their pregnancies had a higher rate of smoking, STDs, leaving school
and subsequent pregnancies compared to those who did
not plan [21]. It is thus unclear whether the positive effect
of planning on health behaviour transcends across different age groups or if such decisions may affect subsequent
changes in health related behaviour.
There has been surprisingly little research into the effect
of pregnancy planning on morbidity in pregnancy but
unplanned pregnancy, severe pregnancy related nausea
and vomiting, high perceived stress and low social support
were found to be associated with lower levels of psychosocial adjustment during pregnancy in a Taiwanese study

[22]. A study in Turkey also found women who did not
plan their pregnancies had higher rates of depressive
symptoms during their pregnancy [23].
Research from as early as the 1970s showed that smoking
in pregnancy increases the risk of having a low birth weight
baby [24]. Our findings add to this evidence-base, demonstrating a clear impact of smoking on low birthweight after
adjustment for confounding factors. Smoking during pregnancy has also been shown to increase the risk of having a
baby that is small for gestational age and suffering from
fetal growth restriction [25-27]. The impact on the fetus’


growth may be partly explained by the increased incidence
of abnormal placental structure and function related to
smoking [28]. A review of intervention studies has also
shown that smoking cessation during pregnancy can reduce
the risk of low birth weight and pre-term birth [29].

Conclusions
Evidence about the adverse effect of smoking before and
during pregnancy is strong, and effective smoking cessation
interventions have been identified. Our study provides
additional evidence of the benefits of stopping or reducing
smoking during pregnancy. The message that it is never
too late to give up smoking needs to be emphasised, especially at this critical time and for disadvantaged women
who are more likely to smoke during pregnancy.
With over 40% of pregnancies in this study being a
surprise, a more targeted policy to increase pregnancy
planning and awareness of pre-pregnancy health is recommended. Compared to pregnancy planners, non-planners
tended to be young, single and less well educated women.
However, more rigorous measurement of pregnancy planning is needed to establish the full impact of pregnancy
planning on neonatal outcomes.
