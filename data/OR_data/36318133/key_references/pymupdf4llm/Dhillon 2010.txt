Abstract
Objective: to identify the prevalence of antenatal depression among Asian women living in the UK in one antenatal
clinic, and to investigate the possible association with a desire for a male child and other risk factors.
Design: cross-sectional questionnaire-based study.
Setting: general antenatal clinic in a hospital in Birmingham.
Participants: 300 Asian women, irrespective of place of birth.
Methods: consecutive Asian women attending routine antenatal appointments during the study period self-completed
a questionnaire. The first part investigated socio-demographic, cultural and other possible risk factors, including
gender preference. The second part comprised the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).
Measurements: EPDS score greater than or equal to 12 indicating probable depression.
Findings: the prevalence of depression was 30.7% (92/300, 95% confidence interval 25.4–35.9%). Maternal male gender
preference was not common and was not associated with antenatal depression. Family male gender preference,
unplanned pregnancy, a history of depression and feeling anxious in pregnancy were independently associated with an
increased likelihood of depression, whilst support from family and friends, being satisfied with pregnancy and being
multiparous were associated with a reduced likelihood of depression.
Conclusion: rates of antenatal depression were very high in Asian women with some associated risk factors. However,
male gender preference was not associated with antenatal depression.
Implications for practice: given the high prevalence, screening Asian women for depression may be indicated to allow
treatment.

#### Introduction

Depression is a common disorder globally and a
major cause of disability (World Health Organization, 2006). It is known that depression is more


common in women than men across many cultures,
and its first onset often occurs during the childbearing years (Weissman and Olfson, 1995). In
the developed world, postnatal depression has
been the subject of many investigations and its

prevalence is estimated to be 10–15% (O’Hara and
Swain, 1996). The negative and ongoing impacts of
postnatal depression, physically, cognitively and
socially on infant development, have been well
documented (Beck, 1998; Patel et al., 2004; Rahman et al., 2007). Children with mothers who have
postnatal depression have a higher rate of insecure
attachments and perform poorly in cognitive tasks
(Cogill et al., 1986; Murray, 1992; Murray et al.,
1996).
Antenatal depression, generally defined as the
onset of depressive symptoms during pregnancy,
can occur at any gestation (Bennett et al., 2004).
Less information is available on antenatal depression but studies have generally demonstrated a
prevalence of 9–17% (Evans et al., 2001; Joseffsson
et al., 2001; Heron et al., 2004). Antenatal
depression has important implications for fetal
and maternal health. Women with antenatal
depression or anxiety have been found to have
more planned caesarean sections and epidural use
in labour (Andersson et al., 2004), to be at a higher
risk of pre-eclampsia (Kurki et al., 2000), and to be
more likely to deliver preterm and have low-birth
weight infants (Steer et al., 1992; Hedegaard et
al., 1993). Furthermore, antenatal depression is
associated with postnatal depression (Cooper et
al., 1996; Forman et al., 2000).
Although research has been conducted on antenatal and postnatal depression in Asian countries,
few studies have examined antenatal depression
among Asian women living in Western countries.
High rates of postnatal depression (28%) have been
reported in Pakistani women (Rahman et al., 2003),
with rates of 11–23% in Indian women (Chandran et
al., 2002; Patel et al., 2002). Information on
antenatal depression from the developing world is
more limited, but one study in India found a
prevalence of 16% (Chandran et al., 2002) and
another study in Pakistan found a prevalence of 25%
(Rahman and Creed, 2007).
Gender preference, meaning a desire for a male
child, exists in many cultures in South Asia, the
Middle East and East Asia (Booth et al., 1994;
Nielsen et al., 1997; Chandran et al., 2002; Patel et
al., 2002; Ekuklu et al., 2004; Lofstedt et al.,
2004). This can be illustrated by the example of
India, where sex-selected abortions of female
fetuses are believed to have contributed to the
unequal male-to-female ratio (Booth et al., 1994;
Nielsen et al., 1997; Sharma et al., 2007). In these
societies, the birth of a female child when a male
child is desired has been found to be associated
with postnatal depression (Ghubash and AbouSaleh, 1997; Chandran et al., 2002; Patel et al.,
2002; Rahman et al., 2003; Ekuklu et al., 2004).


The aim of this study was to identify the
prevalence of antenatal depression among Asian
women living in the UK in one antenatal clinic, and
to investigate the possible association with a desire
for a male child and other risk factors.

#### Methods

The study was cross-sectional, conducted at a large
maternity hospital in Birmingham, UK. Birmingham
is a diverse city with 66% of the population
identifying themselves as White British compared
with the 87% national average (Population Census
Data, 2001). The Asian ethnic groups in Birmingham
include Pakistani (10.6%), Indian (5.7%), Bangladeshi (2.1%) and other Asian (1.0%) (Population Census
Data, 2001). Eighty-four per cent of Birmingham
residents are born in the UK (Population Census
Data, 2001).
Women of Asian ethnicity were recruited from
general antenatal appointments from January to
April 2007. Asian ethnicity was defined as Pakistani,
Bangladeshi or Indian descent, irrespective of place
of birth. Other Asian ethnicities were excluded as
they constitute only a small percentage of the
Birmingham population (Population Census Data,
2001). All women recognised to be Asian, either
from names on the clinic list or their appearance,
were asked if they were able to speak and read
English and then asked if they would participate.
Although this study focused on Indian, Pakistani and
Bangladeshi women, within these areas, many
different languages are spoken. It was not possible
to obtain translators for all the different languages,
so women unable to speak English could not be
included in the study. Ethical approval was received
from the South Birmingham Ethics Committee.
After written informed consent, women were
given an anonymous two-part questionnaire to
complete. The first part included questions on risk
factors identified in previous studies, in particular
the questionnaire used by Patel et al. (2002) in
their study in Goa, India. Data were sought about
socio-demographic characteristics (age, household,
ethnicity, country of birth, marital status, employment) and about topics such as social support from
husband, family and friends and the quality of
support. Data were recorded on present pregnancy
(number of weeks of gestation, unplanned pregnancy, satisfaction with pregnancy) and previous
pregnancy such as number of other children and
their gender. Data about present and previous
psychological illness, specifically previous antenatal depression, previous postnatal depression and


-----

feeling anxious in pregnancy, and information
regarding gender preference were also collected.
The second part of the questionnaire comprised the
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) to
identify women with probable antenatal depression
(Cox et al., 1987; Murray and Cox, 1990). This 10item self-complete scale was developed to screen
for postnatal depression but has been validated for
use in pregnancy and for use around the world
(Green and Murray, 1994; Ebehard-Gran et al.,
2002). The scale ranges from 0 to 30 and a cut-off
score of greater than or equal to 12 was used to
identify probable cases of depression, as recommended by a validation study in pregnancy, to
include all women with both major and minor
depression (Murray and Cox, 1990).
The questionnaire was self-completed with the
researcher present if clarification was required.
Women could return questionnaires directly to the
researcher or to a box at the clinic reception to
maintain anonymity. A pilot study of 50 subjects
demonstrated that women had adequate levels of
literacy and were confident in completing the
questionnaire. Some struggled with the meaning of
gender when answering on gender preference, so this
was changed to preference for the sex of the child.
The question was phrased so that women were asked
‘what sex do you want your child to be?’ and could
answer one of male, female or do not mind.
Data were analysed using Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) with two-tailed significance levels of
less than 0.05. Association between variables and
antenatal depression were investigated using univariate analysis. Chi-squared test was used for
categorical variables and Fisher’s exact test was
used where expected cell sizes were less than five.
For continuous variables, t-tests or Mann–Whitney
U-tests were used for parametric or non parametric
data where indicated. To identify factors independently associated with antenatal depression, variables were entered into a binary forward stepwise
logistic regression model, and odds ratios and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.

#### Findings

Only 26 of the 364 Asian women attending clinics
were ineligible for inclusion in the study as they were
unable to speak English. Of the 338 eligible women,
300 participated; a response rate of 88.8%. Twentythree women refused to participate and 15 questionnaires were incomplete or not returned (see
Table 1). Ninety-two women met the threshold score


of greater than or equal to 12 for depression, giving a
prevalence of 30.7% ( 95% CI 25.4–35.9%). Thus, the
power of the study, based on equivalence of
proportion, to investigate the association of antenatal depression with male gender preference was 93%.
Univariate analyses were conducted to identify
associations between socio-demographic and cultural factors and antenatal depression (see Table
1). Factors found to be significantly associated with
increased likelihood of depression were unplanned
pregnancy, previous antenatal depression, previous
postnatal depression, depression at some other
time, feeling anxious in pregnancy, and family
preference for a male child. Factors found to be
significantly associated with a decreased likelihood
of developing depression included being satisfied
with pregnancy, number of people providing support, quality of support from family and friends as
rated by women, and support from husband.
Only 22/300 (7.3%) women desired a male child
and there was no association with antenatal
depression (see Table 2). Although the difference
was not significant, more women (28/300, 9.3%)
desired a female child. Thirty-eight of 300 (12.7%)
women stated that their family had a preference
for a male child, and this was significantly
associated with antenatal depression. Most of the
women whose families desired a male (31/38,
81.6%) compared with those with no such preference (7/292, 2.4%) did not already have a male
child. Among families of Indian women, 19.5% (16/
82) had a preference for a male relative to 9.8%
(19/189) of the Pakistani women.
A potential confounding factor in examining the
role of gender preference was that some women
(68, 22.7%) were aware of the sex of their baby.
This was adjusted for by entering as a variable in
the logistic regression model, along with other
potentially confounding factors, but it was not
found to be associated with antenatal depression.
The logistic regression model showed, after adjustment, that factors positively associated with
antenatal depression were unplanned pregnancy,
previous antenatal depression, depression at some
other time, feeling anxious in the pregnancy and
family preference for a male (see Table 3). Support
from family and friends, being satisfied with
pregnancy and being multiparous were negatively
associated with antenatal depression.

women of Asian ethnicity living in the UK. The high
prevalence of depression during pregnancy in this
study (30.7%, 95% CI 25.4–35.9%) indicates that this
poses an important issue for UK Asian women. This
prevalence is higher than the 25% reported in
Pakistan and 16% in India (Chandran et al., 2002;
Rahman and Creed, 2007). It is also higher than the
7–15% prevalence reported in studies from general
populations in the developed world (Evans et al.,
2001; Joseffsson et al., 2001; Heron et al., 2004). It
is comparable, however, with rates of postnatal
depression found in Pakistan, India and the Middle
East (Patel et al., 2002; Rahman et al., 2003;
Ekuklu et al., 2004). However, it should be noted
that some variation between depression rates could
occur due to the utilisation of different methods to
assess and record depression.
This study specifically examined male gender
preference and its association with antenatal
depression. Only a few women (7.3%) had a
preference for a male child; in fact, female
preference was a little more common. Preference
for a son exists in many countries in South East Asia
and the Middle East, often due to social and
cultural beliefs (Booth et al., 1994; Chandran et
al., 2002; Patel et al., 2002; Ekuklu et al., 2004;
Lofstedt et al., 2004). In countries such as India,
economic pressures and religious pressures, such as
funeral rites, also make sons more desirable than
daughters (Arnold et al., 1998). A recent survey in
Pakistan found a significantly greater preference
for male than female children (Zubair et al., 2007).
Previous studies in the developing world have found
an association between male gender preference
and depression in the postnatal period, and a study
in Egypt found that women who desired a son were
more likely to have antenatal depression than
women who desired a daughter (Kamal et al.,
1999).
A history of previous antenatal depression or
depression at some other time was found to be
associated with antenatal depression and is consistent with the literature (O’Hara and Swain,
1996). Previous postnatal depression did not remain
in the predictive model even though this association is well documented in the literature. This is
probably because it was very closely related with
depression at some other time, which may have
displaced it in the statistical model. Anxiety in
pregnancy has been related to postnatal depression
(Zubair et al., 2007). In the developing world,
unwelcome or unplanned pregnancies have been
found to be associated with postnatal depression
(Ghubash and Abou-Saleh, 1997; Chandran et al.,
2002; Ekuklu et al., 2004). Again consistent with
the literature, in both Western and non-Western


societies, women with more support from family
and friends were less likely to develop depression
(Zuckerman et al., 1989; Hobfall et al., 1995;
Se´guin et al., 1995; Bolton et al., 1998; Ritter et
al., 2000; Chandran et al., 2002; Patel et al., 2002;
Rahman et al., 2003).
Although the questionnaires were anonymous,
women often attended the clinic with their
partners or family members and so this may have
presented a situation for social desirability bias.
Some of the EPDS questions enquire about personal
issues, such as self-harm, and women may have
been unwilling to divulge this information in the
vicinity of family members or friends, which would
have led to an underestimation of depression.
Similarly, overestimations of support actually received may have been reported. Participants were
asked to self-complete questionnaires but occasionally there appeared to be discussion with
people accompanying them. Other studies in the
developing world have observed that women
misinterpreted the meanings of some of the
questions, such as those about self-harm (Patel et
al., 2002; Fisher et al., 2004), but in this study,
comprehension of the questions did not seem to be
an issue. An intrinsic limitation of the EPDS is that it
is a screening tool and is not diagnostic, so it can
only indicate those women with probable depression (Murray and Cox, 1990). Nevertheless, it is
validated for use in research to identify women
with probable depression and has been used by
previous studies for this purpose (Cox et al., 1987;
Murray and Cox, 1990; Green and Murray, 1994).
For logistical reasons, women unable to speak
English were excluded from this study. Due to the
diverse multi-ethnic population of Birmingham, it
would not have been feasible to translate the
questionnaire into all the various South East Asian
languages spoken in the region. However, from the
364 women approached, only 26 were excluded as
they were unable to speak English.
This study found high rates of antenatal depression among Asian women in the UK. Antenatal
depression has significant impacts on the well-being
of the mother and fetus, as well as progressing to
postnatal depression, for which the negative
implications on mother and child are well documented (Murray, 1992; Steer et al., 1992;
Hedegaard et al., 1993; Beck, 1995, 1998; Kurki
et al., 2000; Andersson et al., 2004). Health
practitioners should be aware that such a large
proportion of women may be suffering from
antenatal depression, especially given its adverse
effects and its potential for management, either
through drug treatment or psychological methods
(Antenatal and Postnatal Mental Health, 2007). In


-----

antenatal clinics, utilisation of Whooley questions
as recommended by National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence guidelines may be beneficial (Antenatal and Postnatal Mental Health,
2007).

#### Conclusion

The rates of antenatal depression were shown to be
very high in this sample of Asian women living in the
UK. Very few women stated a preference for a son,
and maternal male gender preference was not
associated with antenatal depression. Familial
preference for a male child was not common but
was associated with antenatal depression. Antenatal depression has implications for fetal development and maternal health, and can progress to
postnatal depression. Further studies to examine
this are important. If this high rate of depression is
confirmed, consideration of early recognition and
treatment may minimise the physical and emotionally distressing impact of this condition.
