# PregnancyIntentionsandHappinessAmong PregnantBlackWomenatHighRiskforAdverse InfantHealthOutcomes

CONTEXT: Unintended pregnancy is associated with risk behaviors and increased morbidity or mortality for mothers
and infants, but a woman’s feelings about pregnancy may be more predictive of risk and health outcomes than her
intentions.

METHODS: A sample of 1,044 black women who were at increased risk were enrolled at prenatal care clinics in the
District of Columbia in 2001–2003. Bivariate and multivariate analyses assessed associations between pregnancy
intentions or level of happiness about being pregnant and multiple psychosocial and behavioral risk factors, and
identified correlates of happiness to be pregnant.

RESULTS: Pregnancyintentionsandhappinesswerestronglyassociated,buthappinesswasthebetterpredictor ofrisk.

used birth control at conception (1.6) and who had 1–2 household members, rather than five or more (2.1).

Much has been written about the conceptof intendedness
of pregnancy.[1–5] Previous research has consistently found
pregnancy intendedness to be associated with several
behavioral and psychosocial risk factors that may influence child health outcomes. Unintended or unwanted
pregnancies have been associated with high-risk health
behaviors during pregnancy, such as continued smoking,[6,7] alcohol use,[6] and later initiation of prenatal care
and fewer prenatal visits.[8–12] Women with unintended or
unwanted pregnancies are more likely to report depression or anxiety during pregnancy and the postpartum
period than are women with intended or wanted pregnancies.[13–15] Risky behaviors are more common among
women with mistimed than intended pregnancies, and
are most common among women whose pregnancies are
unwanted.[16] Perhaps as a direct result, women with
unwanted pregnancies are at greater risk of having poor
pregnancy outcomes than are those with intended or
mistimed pregnancies.[17–21]

However, terminology and strategies for grouping
women for analytic purposes have been inconsistent.[2,22]

Most research has used one measure to assess intendedness, wantedness or timing. For example, some studies
have compared intended with unintended (i.e., mistimed
and unwanted) pregnancies, thus leaving the mistimed


category inadequately explained.[2,22] Others have compared intended with unwanted pregnancies and found
increased rates of high-risk behaviors and poorer prenatal
care utilization among women with the latter.[6,16,23–25]

Still other studies have suggested the need to distinguish
between pregnancy intentions and a woman’s feelings
about her pregnancy, which may be a stronger predictor of
risk.[2,26–28] Thus, while all of these variables are interrelated, there are distinctions in measurement and meaning
that are not fully understood.[3,29–31]

Relatively few studies have examined a woman’s level
of happiness about being pregnant, compared happiness
to pregnancy intentions or looked at associations
between happiness and maternal health behaviors or
pregnancy outcomes. Some studies have found stronger
associations between happiness and pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight than between intention
and outcomes,[11,12,21,31] but we are not aware of any
studies that examined associations between happiness
and risk factors for poor pregnancy outcomes, or
that sought to identify other correlates of happiness.
And although happiness correlates strongly with intendedness,[5,22,27,31] happiness and intendedness are not
synonymous and may be measuring slightly different
constructs. It is important to elaborate these distinctions,


-----

since differentiation between the two could have implications for the provision of prenatal care[27] and, potentially, pregnancy outcomes.
The purposes of the current study were to determine
whether an association exists between pregnancy intentions and happiness, to assess the relative importance of
each in predicting psychosocial and behavioral risk
factors, and to identify correlates of maternal happiness
about pregnancy.

METHODS
This study is part of the NIH-DC Initiative, a congressionally mandated project designed to reduce infant morbidity and mortality in the Districtof Columbia. The study
was approved by the institutional review boards of all
participating institutions.*

DesignandProcedures
We present baseline data collected for Healthy Outcomes
of Pregnancy Education (DC-HOPE), a multicomponent
intervention designed to address four behavioral and
psychosocial risks during pregnancy: cigarette smoking,
environmental tobacco smoke exposure, depression and
intimate partner violence.
Women were recruited at six prenatal care clinics
during regularly scheduled visits between July 2001 and
October 2003. They completed a 10-minute, audio
computer-assisted self-interview (audio-CASI) screening
assessment to determine their study eligibility and risk
status. To be eligible, respondents had to identify themselves as black, African American or Latina, reside in the
District of Columbia, be at least 18 years old, speak
English, receive prenatal care at a participating clinic,
enroll in the study by 28 weeks’ gestation and report at
least one of four designated psychosocial and behavioral
risk factors for poor pregnancy outcomes (cigarette
smoking, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke,
depression, intimate partner violence).[†] Screening instruments included the Beck Depression Inventory–Fast
Screen,[32,33] the Abuse Assessment Screen[34] and items
adapted from the Smoke-Free Families screen.[35] Eligible
women who consented to participate completed a telephone baseline questionnaire 3–4 weeks after screening,
and then were randomized to receive either an integrated
intervention for multiple risk factors or usual prenatal

†At audio-CASI screening, 48% of respondents said they had smoked
cigarettes within six months of becoming pregnant, 83% said they had
been exposed to environmental tobacco smoke during their pregnancy,
36% reported depression symptoms in the past month and 21% reported intimate partner violence perpetrated by a partner in the prior
year. There was considerable overlap in risk factors—40% of respondents
reported one risk factor, 37% reported two, 17% reported three and 6%
reported all four.

randomization for DC-HOPE are reported elsewhere.[36]

Of 1,398 eligible women, 85% agreed to participate;
90% of these women were contacted and completed
the baseline interview. Because of the small number of

Latinas in the sample (26), our analyses include only
black participants who answered questions related to
happiness or pregnancy intentions (N=1,013 and 1,007,
respectively).

Measures

dPregnancy intention and happiness. The baseline interview included items adapted from the Pregnancy Risk
Assessment Monitoring System and the National Survey
of Family Growth (NSFG).[37,38] Pregnancy intention was
derived from the following closed-ended questions:
‘‘Were you using any family planning methods to prevent
pregnancy the month before you became pregnant this
time?’’ Women who answered no were then asked if the
reason for not using a method was that they had wanted
to become pregnant. Those who again answered no, or
who said they had used a method, were asked ‘‘At the time
you became pregnant, did you yourself actually want to
have a(nother) baby at some time?’’ A follow-up probe for
those who said they were not sure ascertained whether
the answer to the preceding question was ‘‘probably yes,’’
‘‘probably no’’ or ‘‘didn’t care.’’ Finally, all respondents
who said they wanted to become pregnant at some time
were asked ‘‘Did you become pregnant sooner than you
wanted, later thanyou wanted, or at about the right time?’’
(The other option was ‘‘didn’t care.’’)
Answers to these questions were used to derive three
independent variables reflecting a woman’s pregnancy
intention. The first was a three-level variable of pregnancy
intendedness: intended, mistimed or unwanted. Consistent with the NSFG definitions,[5] a pregnancy was classified as intended if a woman had wanted to conceive when
she did or earlier; mistimed if she had wanted to get
pregnant at some time, but had conceived sooner than
she wanted; and unwanted if she had not wanted to get
pregnant at any time. The other two variables were
dichotomous: intended versus unintended (including
mistimed and unwanted) pregnancy and unwanted
versus wanted (including intended and mistimed)
pregnancy.
A fourth independent variable was derived from an
NSFG item measuring happiness about being pregnant:
Women were asked which number between 1 (indicating
‘‘very unhappy’’) and 10 (‘‘very happy’’) best described


how they felt when they found out they were pregnant.
Women were classified into three groups on the basis of
their responses: happy (8–10), moderately happy (4–7)
and unhappy (1–3) about being pregnant.

dPsychosocial and behavioral risk factors. Seven dependent variables reflecting psychosocial and behavioral risk
factors were assessed at baseline. Self-reported depression within the past month was measured using the
20-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist–Depression Scale.
Respondents rated the extent to which they were distressed by each symptom (e.g., poor appetite, feeling
lonely or blue, restless sleep, thoughts of death or dying)
on a five-point scale from ‘‘not at all’’ to ‘‘extremely
distressed.’’ Responses were summed and divided by
20, and resulting scores were classified into four groups;
a score greater than 0.75 reflected mild, moderate or
severe depression.[39–41]

The Conflict Tactics Scale[42–44] was used to measure the
annual frequency of physical assault and sexual coercion
perpetrated by the woman or her partner. The annual
partner-perpetrated assault and coercion variables were
collapsed into a single score reflecting any intimate
partner violence (by the partner) in the past year. A single
item followed this scale and assessed whether intimate
partner violence had occurred during pregnancy (perpetrated by the woman or her partner).
Behavioral risks were any alcohol or illicit drug use
during pregnancy (as measured by items adapted from
the NSFG and other national surveys), as well as cigarette
smoking or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in
the past week (as measured by items fromthe Smoke-Free
Families questionnaires).[35]

dCorrelates of happiness. Variables used to assess predictors of happiness about being pregnant were classified
into three categories: demographic and intrapersonal
characteristics, reproductive history and related characteristics, and interpersonal relationships and support.
The demographic and intrapersonal characteristics
examined were age, education level, employment status,
income, number of household members, and household
receipt of Medicaid. We used a 15-item, short version
of the Negative Mood Regulation Scale[45–47] to measure
cognitive and behavioral coping strategies for dealing
with negative affector mood states (e.g., ‘‘When I’m upset,
I believe that telling myself it will pass will help me calm
down’’ and ‘‘When I’m upset, I believe that going out to
dinner with friends will help me feel better’’). Each item
was rated on a five-point scale from ‘‘strongly agree’’ to
‘‘strongly disagree’’; negatively worded items were
reverse-coded, and a higher summary score (range, 15–
75) indicated better coping strategies.
The reproductive history and related variables we
assessed were gestational age at baseline survey and at
first prenatal care visit; numbers of pregnancies (including the current one), live births, low-birth-weight infants,
abortions and previous pregnancy complications (i.e.,
miscarriages, stillbirths); pregnancy loss ratio (i.e., a


-----

woman’snumberofmiscarriages, stillbirthsandabortions
divided by her number of pregnancies, with higher scores
indicating greater loss); number of living children and
whether the woman had a child younger than two; use of
a family planning method at conception; pregnancy
attitudes; and reproductive health knowledge.
Pregnancy attitudes were assessed using eight items:
the four NSFG questions (out of 10) on ambivalence
about pregnancy[38] that had performed most consistently
in previous analyses,[5] and four new items developed to
reflect attitudes identified during the intervention pilot
study conducted in this population. Each of these items
was rated on a scale of 1 (‘‘strongly disagree’’) to 10
(‘‘strongly agree’’). Factor analyses and Cronbach’s alpha
coefficients were computed (with negative items reversecoded) to determine how to best characterize attitudes
toward pregnancy within this population. We present
both an overall positive attitude scale for all eight items,
with higher values indicating more positive attitudes
(range, 8–80; alpha, 0.7), and two subscales. The first
subscale comprised three items about worry and concern, with higher values indicating greater worry or
concern (range, 3–30; alpha, 0.6): ‘‘I thought that having
a babywould keep me from doing the things that I wanted
to in my life (like working, going to school, going out and
so on)’’; ‘‘I was worried that I did not have enough money
to take care of this baby’’; and ‘‘I thought that having
a(nother) baby would be more than I could handle.’’ The
second subscale consisted of three items about looking
forward to the future, for which higher values indicated
that the respondent was more positive about the future
(range, 3–30; alpha, 0.6): ‘‘I looked forward to the new
experiences that having a baby would bring’’; ‘‘I looked
forward to buying and getting things for a new baby’’; and
‘‘I looked forward to the father, the baby and I being
a family together.’’ Two items asking how partners and
others felt about the pregnancy were not sufficiently
correlated to justify combining them into a third subscale
(r, 0.1; alpha, 0.2), but these were included in the overall
positive attitude scale: ‘‘I thought my partner would not
want me to have this baby’’ and ‘‘I thought that my family
and friends would be happy that I was pregnant.’’
Reproductive health knowledge was assessed by 10
items (possible responses were ‘‘true,’’ ‘‘false’’ and ‘‘don’t
know’’). Six focused on knowledge of STDs (e.g., ‘‘For
most sexually transmitted diseases, women usually get
early symptoms or warning signs’’), three on pregnancy
spacing (e.g., ‘‘A woman who becomes pregnant within
one year of having a child is more likely to have a lower
weight baby’’) and one on the timing of conception (‘‘The
time women can get pregnant occurs on only one day in
each menstrual cycle’’). Responses were recoded as
correct or incorrect (which included ‘‘don’t know’’) and
summed. Psychometric analyses (principal components,
exploratory factor and Cronbach’s alpha) did not support
the creation of subscales, so only the full scale was used
(range, 1–10; alpha, 0.4).

version of the Support Behaviors Inventory assessed
a woman’s satisfaction with the emotional support from
her current partner (whether or not the partner was the
baby’s father) and others.[48] (Sample items measured the
woman’s satisfaction with the degreeto which her partner
‘‘shows interest in my daily activities and problems’’ and
‘‘tolerates my ups and downs and unusual behaviors.’’)
Items were rated on a six-point scale from ‘‘very dissatisfied’’ to ‘‘very satisfied.’’ Separate scales were created to
reflect support from partners and from others; both
demonstrated high internal consistency reliability (range,
11–66; alpha, 0.9). Exploratory and confirmatory factor
analyses indicated that the items grouped together into one
factor, and factor loadings were high (0.7–0.9 for partners,
and 0.8–0.9 for others). For the multivariate analysis of
a woman’s satisfaction with partner support, we shifted
the scale to 0–5 and gave women who had no partner
the lowest score (range, 0–55).
Four summary scores were created from the Conflict
Tactics Scale (described earlier) to assess the annual
frequency of physical assault and sexual coercion; for
each type of aggression, we looked at whether the partner
or the woman had perpetrated the aggression. Women
were also asked whether they had personally received
services related to any risk factor (smoking cessation,
treatment of depression, intervertions targeting family
violence or family planning; range, 0–4) or to other
psychosocial needs (home visits, alcohol or drug treatment, or support from a social worker or counselor;
range, 0–5) in the past year.


Analysis
We hypothesized that there would be strong associations
between pregnancy intentions and happiness, and that
women who were unhappy about being pregnant and
those who had unwanted pregnancies would be at greater
psychosocial and behavioral risk than women who were
happy and those who had intended pregnancies, respectively. We also hypothesized that happiness about a pregnancy would be a stronger predictor of risks during
pregnancy than pregnancy intention.
Spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess
associations between the three-level pregnancy intention
and happiness variables. Chi-square tests and multivariate
logistic regression models controlling for maternal age, education, employment status and gestational age were used
to examine associations between intention and happiness
and the seven psychosocial and behavioral risk factors.
The analysis of correlates of happiness was performed
in three stages. First, bivariate comparisons of the happiness variable and the independent variables were conducted using chi-square tests and analysis of variance.
Classification and regression trees[49,50] were used to
assess the importance of the independent variables and
relationships between variables that were strongly associated with happiness. Correlation analyses were then
performed to reduce the number of independent variables and to avoid multicollinearity in the models. At the
second stage, initial multivariate logistic regression
models were developed to identify characteristics that
were independently associated with happiness about
being pregnant. Variables that were significant in bivariate
comparisons at p£.20 were included in three models
(some were excluded to reduce multicollinearity): demographic and intrapersonal characteristics, reproductive
history and related characteristics, and interpersonal
relationships and support. At the last stage, variables
significant at p£.20 in the initial models were analyzed in
a multivariate model with a sample of 989 women
(24 respondents were excluded because of missing
responses). All models used a dichotomous happiness
variable (unhappy vs. happy and moderately happy
combined) and controlled for maternal age, education
and employment status. None of the Hosmer and
Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test p values was .05 or less.

RESULTS
SampleCharacteristics
Among the 1,013 women in the sample, the mean age
at baseline was 25 (range, 18–52), and the mean gestational age was 19 weeks (range, 3–38—Table 1, page 195).
Seventy percent had at least a high school education, 38%
were employed and 78% received Medicaid. A large
majority of women were single, 24% were married or
living with a partner, and 5% were separated or divorced.
Seventy-eight percent stated that their current partner
was the baby’s father, 4% were with a different partner
and 18% had no current partner.


-----

Seven in 10 respondents had other children, and threefourths had not used any family planning method at the
time of conception. Thirty-four percent had intended to
become pregnant when they did; 42% became pregnant
sooner than they had wanted and 24% had not wanted
a pregnancy at any time. Forty-one percent of women
reported that they were happy about being pregnant,
40% were moderately happy and 19% were unhappy.
At baseline, 18% of respondents had smoked cigarettes
in the past week, 57% had been exposed to environmental tobacco smoke in the past week and 44% reported
having been depressed in the past month. Thirty-two
percent of women reported physical or sexual intimate
partner violence perpetrated by a partner in the past year,
and17%reportedviolence perpetrated byeithera partner
or herself during the pregnancy. Twenty-two percent of
respondents had used alcohol during the pregnancy, and
12% had used illicit drugs in this period.

PregnancyIntention,HappinessandRiskBehaviors
A woman’s happiness about being pregnant was significantly associated with pregnancy intention (correlation
coefficient, 0.6; p<.05). Sixty-seven percent of women who
were happy to be pregnant had intended to become
pregnant at the time they did, compared with 16% of those
who were moderately happy and 4% of those who were
unhappy (Figure 1, page 196). Twenty-seven percent of
women who were happy to be pregnant had a mistimed
pregnancy; in contrast, 59% of women who were moderately happy and 39% of those who were unhappy reported
having a mistimed pregnancy. Finally, 6% of women who
were happy to be pregnant had an unwanted pregnancy,
compared with 25% of those who were moderately happy
and 57% of those who were unhappy.
In bivariate comparisons, a woman’s happiness about
beingpregnantwasstronglyassociatedwithbehavioraland
psychosocial risk (Table 2, page 197). Significantly higher
proportions of women who were unhappy to be pregnant
than of those who were moderately happy or happy
reported five of the seven risk factors: having smoked
cigarettes in the past week (26% vs. 16–17%), having been
depressed in the past month (60% vs. 37–43%), having
experiencedintimatepartnerviolenceinthepastyear(40%
vs. 27–33%), and having drunk alcohol (26% vs. 17–24%)
or used illicit drugs (16% vs. 9–13%) during pregnancy.
In contrast, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in
the past week was less common among women who were
unhappy to be pregnant than among those who were
moderately happy or happy (48% vs. 58–60%).
Pregnancy intention had fewer associations with the
various risk factors. A higher proportion of women with
unwanted pregnancies than of those with intended or
mistimed pregnancies had smoked in the past week (28%
vs. 15–16%). Women with unintended pregnancies were
at greater risk than those with intended pregnancies of
having been depressed in the past month (46% vs. 39%)
or having drunk alcohol during their pregnancy (23% vs.

18%). Finally, a larger proportion of women reporting an
unwanted pregnancy than of those reporting a wanted
pregnancy had smoked cigarettes in the past week (28%
vs. 15%), whereas a smaller proportion had been exposed
to environmental tobacco smoke (51% vs. 59%).
Multivariate findings confirmed many of the bivariate
findings; most of the significant differences were between
women who were unhappy and those who were happy
about being pregnant (Table 3). Compared with the latter
women, the former had higher odds of having smoked
cigarettes in the past week (odds ratio, 1.9), having drunk
alcohol (1.9) or used illicit drugs (1.7) during pregnancy,
having been depressed in the past month (2.6) or having
experienced intimate partner violence in the past year
(1.8); they had reduced odds of having been exposed to
environmental tobacco smoke (0.6). Only one comparison between moderately happy and happy women
reached significance: The odds of having drunk alcohol
during pregnancy were elevated for those who were
moderately happy (1.8).
In multivariate comparisons of pregnancy intention,
there was less consistency, and fewer comparisons were

significant. The odds of cigarette smoking were higher
among women with unwanted versus intended pregnancies (odds ratio, 1.9), and the odds of being depressed
(1.4) and drinking alcohol (1.6) were elevated among
those with mistimed pregnancies. In multivariate comparisons of women with intended versus those with
unintended pregnancies (not shown), the latter had
increased odds of drinking during pregnancy (1.5;
p<.01) and of being depressed in the past month (1.4;
p<.05). In comparisons of women with wanted versus
those with unwanted pregnancies, the latter were at
increased risk for smoking (1.7; p<.0001). No other risk
factor comparisons were associated with intention.

CorrelatesofHappiness
Once we determined that happiness about being pregnant was strongly associated with more behavioral and
psychosocial risk factors than was pregnancy intention,


we sought to identify the independent correlates of
happiness.
Levels of education, employment status and household
receipt of Medicaid were similar regardless of women’s
feelings about being pregnant (Table 4, page 199). In
general, unhappy women were slightly older and lived in
households with more members. Women who were
happy were likely to use a greater range of cognitive and
behavioral coping strategies to deal with negative affect or
mood states than were those who were moderately happy
or unhappy.
Reproductive history and related characteristics were
strongly associated with happiness about being pregnant
(Table 5). Compared with women who were happy or
moderately happy to be pregnant, those who were
unhappy were likely to have had more pregnancies, to
have more living children or a child younger than age two,
to have reported later gestational age at both first prenatal
visit and baseline survey, and to have used a contraceptive
method at the time of conception. Among respondents
with prior pregnancies, a higher proportion of those
who were happy about being pregnant than of those
whowere moderately happyor unhappy had experienced
a prior pregnancy complication or pregnancy loss. As
might be expected, the attitudes of unhappy women
toward this pregnancy were less positive: They had lower
scores for overall positive attitude and optimism for the
future than did happy or moderately happy women,
and a higher score for worry and concern about having
a baby.
The quality of interpersonal relationships and the
extent of emotional support were also significantly associated with women’s happiness about being pregnant
(Table 6). Unhappy women were more likely than
others to be single, to have had two or more sexual
partners in the past year and to have no current partner;
they also had had more experiences of sexual coercion in
the past year. Lower proportions of unhappy women
reported that their current partner was the father of this
baby, that the baby’s father desired the pregnancy and
that he was extremely emotionally supportive. Furthermore, unhappy women were less satisfied with the
emotional support received from partners and others,
and they had a greater likelihood of having received
any services related to risk factors or other psychosocial
needs in the past year.
All variables in Table 4 except receipt of Medicaid were
included in the initial regression model of demographic
and intrapersonal characteristics. Several variables in
Table 5 were excluded from the initial model of reproductive history and related characteristics: gestational age
at first prenatal visit (because gestational age at baseline
was included), number of pregnancies and having previous pregnancy complications (because pregnancy loss
ratio and number of living children were included), and
all of the pregnancy attitude scales (because of their
strong correlation with happiness). Two variables in


-----

Table 6 were excluded from the initial model of interpersonal relationship and support characteristics because of
their strong correlation with the father’s desire for the
pregnancy: emotional support from the partner and from
the baby’s father.
In the final multivariate model (Table 7, page 202), the
odds of being happy to be pregnant were elevated among
women with less than a college education (odds ratios,
2.5 for women with less than a high school degree and 2.0
for high school graduates), and were higher among those
living in households with 1–2 members than among
those whose households consisted of five or more (2.1).
The odds of being happy also increased with women’s use
of positive cognitive and behavioral coping strategies to
deal with negative moods or affect (1.03). Three reproductive characteristics were associated with reducedodds
of being happy to be pregnant: increased gestational age at
enrollment (0.97), having other children (0.3–0.4) and
having a child younger than two (0.4). The likelihood of
being happy was elevated among women who had not
used a birth control method at the time they became
pregnant (1.6). Several interpersonal characteristics were
also significant correlates of a woman’s happiness about
being pregnant: Odds were reduced among women who
were single, who had had more than one sexual partner in
the past year, who did not have a current partner and who
reported that the baby’s father did not want this pregnancy (0.4–0.6).

DISCUSSION
Measures of happiness about being pregnant, or a partner’s happiness, may yield stronger associations with
prenatal care initiation or utilization, and pregnancy
outcomes (e.g., low birth weight, prematurity, infant
death), than traditional measures reflecting pregnancy
intentions or timing.[11,12,21,51] And while previous studies
have compared pregnancy intentions with happiness, we
are not aware of any studies that have assessed associations between feelings about pregnancy and maternal risk
behaviors, or that have identified correlates of happiness
about pregnancy.
As in previous research,[5,22,27,31] pregnancy intentions
and happiness were strongly correlated in this study.
Women who were happy to be pregnant were most likely
to have an intended pregnancy, those who were moderately happy were most likely to have a mistimed pregnancy and those who were unhappy were most likely to
have an unwanted pregnancy. However, one-third or
more of women in each happiness category reported
intentions that were not consistent. Thus, these two
variables are not interchangeable and may be measuring
different, yet strongly related constructs, as has been
suggested elsewhere.[22,27,31]

We also demonstrated that happiness to be pregnant
was strongly associated with more psychosocial and
behavioral risk factors than was pregnancy intention.
These findings support pregnancyoutcome data,[21,51] and

further suggest that a woman’s feelings about her pregnancy may be a stronger determinant of psychosocial or
behavioral risk during pregnancy than pregnancy intentionsor timing.Infact,manywomen whohavea mistimed
pregnancy may ultimately come to view their pregnancy
positively,[21] despite its being unintended. The desire for
a baby, which Stanford and colleagues[52] describe as
stemming from personal, partner and community values
about childbearing, is therefore important to consider.
The finding that women who were happy to be
pregnant were more likely than unhappy women to
report exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the
past week was contrary to our expectations and warrants
further study. Happier women may be more likely to have
partners, or likely to have a larger social circle, and
therefore potentially have a greater chance of encountering smokers. Or women who are happy may be more

sensitized to or aware of environmental risks and how
they may adversely affect pregnancy, and thus these
women report greater exposure. Alternatively, this may


be the risk factor over which women have the least
control.
After establishing associations between happiness and
risk, we sought to identify the demographic, intrapersonal, reproductive and interpersonal correlates of a
woman’s feelings about pregnancy. A distinct pattern of
personal and social factors was associated with happiness
in this ethnically and socioeconomically homogeneous
sample. Multivariate analyses found that women who
were happy or moderately happy to be pregnant were less
educated, lived in smaller households and had a greater
range of coping strategies than unhappy women. Happy
women were also less likely to have been using birth
control at conception, which is consistent with either
their having planned the pregnancy or their not having
intended to avoid pregnancy. In contrast, the odds of
being happy were reduced among women who had other
children, who had a child younger than two and who were
further along in their pregnancies, which suggests that
happiness was strongly related to parity and prenatal care
initiation. The odds were also reduced among women
who were single, who had no current partner, who
perceived that the baby’s father did not desire the
pregnancy and who had had more than one sexual
partner in the past year—highlighting the importance of
intimate partner relationships and the father’s desire to
have this child in influencing a woman’s feelings about
her pregnancy.
These findings are similar to those of previous studies
that have found associations between pregnancy intentions and women’s reproductive history and contraceptive
practices,[37,53,54] as well as the quality and stability of
partner relationships.[52,54–57] However, several differences
merit further study. For example, demographic correlates
of unintended or unwanted pregnancy in other studies
have included younger age,[37,56] receipt of Medicaid,[37,54,58]

less education[37,58] and being black.[37] Interpersonal correlates have included increased risk for intimate partner
violence before or during pregnancy[16,59,60] and less emotional support from others.[54] In representative samples,
black, poor and less educated women have been shown to
have elevated risks of infant morbidity and mortality,
unintended pregnancy and some maternal risk behaviors;[37,61–63] one study demonstrated that they are less
likely than others to receive advice from their prenatal care
providers about those risks.[64]

Several factors in our study were not independently
associated with happiness (e.g., maternal age, receipt of
Medicaid, experience of intimate partner violence, emotional support from others) or their associations were the
opposite of those found in the pregnancy intention
literature (e.g., women who were happy had lower levels
of education). Reasons for these differences and similarities areimportant to consider in futureresearch; the most
obvious potential explanation is that this study was
conducted among a homogeneous sample of low-income
black women who were at elevated risk.


-----

Limitations
Several study limitations must be considered. First, these
analyses were based on cross-sectional data, and hence
our findings reflect associations but do not indicate
causality. Second, the analyses were based on recall—pregnancy intendedness questions were phrased in relation to plans at the time of conception, and the happiness
question focused on a woman’s feelings when she found
out she was pregnant. Third, women might have
answered differently had they been surveyed earlier or
later in their pregnancy; within-subject variation in pregnancy perceptions,[65,66] and in risk factors such as
depression,[67] smoking[68] and alcohol use,[69] has been
found across trimesters. And while we controlled for
gestational age in our analyses of risk, assessments for
some women may have occurred before or after they
initiated changes to protect their baby from potential
harm. Fourth, we included only a subset of possible
correlates of happiness that might influence a woman’s
feelings about her pregnancy, or potentially explain
differences between our findings and previous ones.
Finally, we used a nonrepresentative sample of lowincome black women who screened into a multifactor
behavioral intervention trial because they were at
increased risk, and so our findings cannot be generalized
beyond a similar population.

Conclusions
Our findings suggest that several simple screening
questions—asking pregnant women to rate how happy
they are to be pregnant, asking about their perceptions of
the fathers’ desire for the pregnancy, and asking about
their current and recent partner relationships—could
help prenatal care providers identify women who are at
increased risk for adverse infant health outcomes.
Women at risk could easily be referred for additional
support or in-depth screening to identify more specific
needs. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ Committee on Health Care for Underserved
Women recommends perinatal screening and intervention for psychosocial risk factors that may influence
a woman’s attentiveness to personal health matters, prenatal care use and ultimately her child’s health.[70] Psychosocial screening is recommended and should be
documented in medical records for all women, at least
once each trimester. Screening is recommended for
depression, stress, social support, intimate partner violence, barriers to care (e.g., transportation, child care,
insurance), communication barriers, unstable housing,
neighborhood safety, risk behaviors (e.g., tobacco and
other substance use, nutrition), pregnancy intentions and
parenting concerns, but not for a woman’s—or her
perceptions of her partner’s—feelings about her pregnancy, nor for her current or recent partner relationships.
Prenatal screening that assesses a woman’s feelings
about her pregnancy, the quality of partner relationships
and particularly her perceptions of the father’s desire for


the pregnancy could significantly strengthen prenatal
care services for women who have potentially heightened
risk during pregnancy. Screening for these factors could
help improve providers’ sensitivity, lead to tailored advice
on strategies to reduce behavioral and psychosocial risks,
focus provider attention on the emotional and social
context of women’s pregnancies, and help women get
needed support to improve pregnancy and infant health
outcomes. A psychosocial screening tool being used in
Canada that includes similar items has received favorable
response from providers and clients, and has proven
successful in facilitating client disclosure and provider
identification of psychosocial risk factors during pregnancy.[71,72] Finding ways to ensure that psychosocial
screening for these factors, in addition to those recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, becomes a standard practice in prenatal
care is a critical step in improving both maternal and
infant health.
