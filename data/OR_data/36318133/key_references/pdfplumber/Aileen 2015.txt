0.65-1.29). Combining pregnancy planning (yes/no) and timing (yes/no) into a 4-level category
showed no significant association with preterm birth or small for gestational age.
Conclusion(s)—In a large cohort with antenatally assessed pregnancy planning and timing,
outcome data collected from medical record abstraction, and robust analysis adjusting for multiple
confounding factors including maternal demographics, medical conditions, and other risk factors,
neither pregnancy planning nor pregnancy timing showed a significant association with preterm or
small for gestational age infants. This study improves upon previous analyses that lack adjustment
for confounding, and use retrospective self-reporting to assess pregnancy planning and timing, and
preterm and small for gestational age birth. Findings may differ in higher risk populations with
higher prevalence of preterm or small for gestational age births.
Capsule—Neither pregnancy planning nor timing showed a significant association with preterm
or small for gestational age births in this large prospective cohort controlling for confounders.

INTRODUCTION
Unplanned pregnancy, which includes pregnancies that are unintended, mistimed, or
unwanted, is common (1, 2). More than half (51%) of all pregnancies in the U.S. are
unplanned (1). The burden of unplanned pregnancy is highest among women ages 18 to 24;
women who were cohabiting but not married; women whose income is below the poverty
line; women with less than a high school diploma; and Black or Hispanic women (1).
Unplanned pregnancies that result in live births (60% of unplanned pregnancies and 40% of
all births) (1-3) have been associated with a variety of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes
including delayed prenatal care, increased physical violence during pregnancy, depression,
reduced breastfeeding, decreased inter-pregnancy intervals, lower likelihood of advanced
educational attainment and higher likelihood of behavioral issues for children from
unplanned pregnancies (4-7).
Whether unplanned pregnancy is associated with preterm birth and/or delivery of a small for
gestational age (SGA) or low birth weight infant is not clear. While there is support for an
association between unplanned pregnancy and either preterm birth (7-17), SGA, or low birth
weight (3,10,11,13,14,17-22), not all studies agree (15,23-27). More clearly understanding
risk factors for preterm and SGA births is a public health priority.
Preterm birth, defined as a live birth before 37 completed weeks gestation, is the leading
cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in developed countries (28). In fact, more infants
(35%) die from preterm-related problems, including low birth weight, than from any other
single cause in the U.S. (29). Preterm birth also significantly increases the risk of cerebral
palsy, vision impairment, cognitive or hearing impairment (30).
In 2012, approximately 1 in 9 infants (11.6% of live births) was born preterm in the U.S.
(31). The disparity in demographic distribution of preterm birth mirrors the pattern for

unplanned pregnancy. The U.S. rate of preterm birth is highest for non-Hispanic black
infants (16.8%), followed by Native Americans (13.6%), Hispanics (11.7%), whites (10.5%)
and Asians (10.3%) (31,32). Preterm birth is highest among women with a history of
preterm birth; women younger than 18 or older than 40 years of age; women with income
below the poverty line; women with less than a high school diploma; and women with
increased stress during pregnancy (31,32). Birth weight is another important predictor of
infant health, and SGA may be associated with intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal morbidity
and mortality (31, 33). Studies that explore the impact of pregnancy planning and timing on
birth outcomes are vulnerable to false associations if they do not take these critical socio-
economic and demographic factors into consideration.
We sought to gain a better understanding of the relationship between unplanned or poorly
timed pregnancy and preterm or SGA birth, and variables (e.g. depression, anxiety, stress,
social support) that affect this relationship. We hypothesized that women with unplanned or
poorly timed pregnancies would have a higher risk of preterm birth and SGA. By
investigating this relationship, there may be an opportunity to identify individual women
with unplanned or poorly timed pregnancy and develop interventions to decrease the risk of
preterm or SGA birth. And if pregnancy planning and timing are associated with preterm or
SGA births, decreasing unplanned or poorly timed pregnancies could be a potentially
effective strategy for decreasing the national preterm birth rate. By prospectively assessing
pregnancy planning and timing prior to delivery, collecting outcome data from medical
record abstraction instead of birth certificate data or retrospective survey responses from
parents, and performing robust adjustments for multiple confounding factors including
maternal demographics, medical conditions, and other risk factors, our analysis adds to and
improves upon the previous literature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Recruitment, Enrollment, and Assessment Procedures
We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study designed to explore the
associations of major depressive episodes and/or antidepressant medication use in pregnancy
with adverse birth outcomes, including the risk for preterm birth (34,35). To be eligible for
the study, women had to be at least 18 years of age (16 at the Yale site), less than 18 weeks
estimated gestational age with a singleton pregnancy, speak English or Spanish, and have
access to a telephone. Women with insulin-dependent diabetes, plans to terminate their
pregnancy, or intention to relocate were ineligible. Study size was calculated to show a 2-
fold difference in preterm birth among women exposed to depression or antidepressant
medication, compared to those who were not exposed, with 85% power assuming a 5%
preterm birth rate (34). Detailed study methods, including recruitment, enrollment and
assessment procedures, staff training and quality control, have been described previously
(34,35). Yale University School of Medicine and participating hospitals provided human
subjects approval for the study.
Study staff recruited and enrolled pregnant women receiving prenatal care from 137
obstetrical practices and hospital-based clinics in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts
between March 2005 and May 2009. Study follow-up continued until September 2009.

After verbal consent was obtained, staff administered a screening questionnaire to collect
information on gestational age, current mood, lifetime and current mood and anxiety
disorders, antidepressant treatment, and exclusion criteria. In order to meet the study’s
primary goal of exploring associations between major depressive episodes and/or
antidepressant medication use in pregnancy with adverse birth outcomes, all women who
met the above criteria and had a current or recent major depressive episode, post-traumatic
stress disorder, or were undergoing antidepressant treatment, and a randomly selected
comparator group with none of those characteristics.
After enrolled participants gave written consent for interviews and medical record review,
study staff conducted an initial home interview before 18 weeks estimated gestational age
(EGA). Staff also interviewed participants by phone at 28 (± 2) weeks gestation and 8 (± 4)
weeks after delivery. All staff interviewers received extensive training including at least 4
days of instruction and 4 supervised interviews.
Exposure and Outcome Measures
At the initial interview, interviewers obtained data on demographic and potential
confounding variables, including mental health outcomes (e.g. depression, post-traumatic
stress disorder) perceived stress, and social support. Maternal age, race, ethnicity, education,
marital status, parity, pregnancy history including previous preterm birth, tobacco use,
alcohol use, other illicit drug use, and medication use was collected. The Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the modified Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
Symptom Scale, the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale, and the modified Kendler Social Support
Interview (MKSSI) were administered at the first visit (36-39). The Cohen Perceived Stress
Scale evaluates the degree to which individuals feel that life events are unpredictable and
uncontrollable (38).38 The modified PTSD Symptom Scale assesses the presence and
severity of DSM-IV PTSD symptoms related to a single identified traumatic event in
individuals (37). The MKSSI is a reliable and valid tool for assessing social support
(emotional and instrumental support) in pregnant women (39).
At each of the three interviews, participants answered questions about major depressive
disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder
from the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview v2.1 (WMH-
CIDI) (40). The WMH-CIDI is a valid and reliable lay interview instrument whether
administered in person or over the telephone, is acceptable for use in pregnant women, and
is further described in previous publications regarding this study (34,35). A standard
algorithm was used to determine whether a participant met criteria for a major depressive
episode during pregnancy. Perceived stress, and social support were not assessed at the
second or third visit.
We measured our exposure of interest at the first study visit (before 18 weeks EGA).
Interviewers assessed pregnancy intention by asking women whether their pregnancy was
planned (“Was this pregnancy planned? Yes/No”), and whether they thought it was a good
time for them to be pregnant (“Do you think this is a good time for you to be pregnant? Yes/
No”).

Medical-record reviewers, who were masked from interview information, abstracted data on
outcomes of preterm birth and SGA infants from hospital records. We used standard of care
definitions for outcome measurement. Preterm birth was defined as delivery before 37
completed weeks of pregnancy (41). Gestational age was verified by a first-trimester
ultrasound where available, last menstrual period, due date set by a physician, or earliest
prenatal ultrasound. SGA refers to newborns whose birth weight is less than the 10th
percentile for gestational age (33).
Statistical Analysis
We used bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the association of
pregnancy planning and timing with preterm and SGA birth, and calculated unadjusted and
adjusted odds ratios, controlling for potential confounding variables. We identified possible
demographic factors (chosen a priori) that might confound the relationship between
pregnancy planning or timing and preterm or SGA birth. Use of tobacco, alcohol or illicit
drugs, depression (major depression 6 months before pregnancy and/or during pregnancy),
and stress are all correlates of pregnancy planning/timing, preterm birth and SGA
(1,21,41-47). Mother’s age, education, race, marital status, gravidity, history of preterm
birth, history of sexual abuse prior to age 18, and social support are all correlates of both
pregnancy planning/timing and preterm birth (1,5,41,42,46-51). Use of selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor during pregnancy, panic disorder during pregnancy, benzodiazepine use
during pregnancy, and post-traumatic stress disorder before pregnancy are correlated with
depression and preterm birth (34). Participants with missing data were excluded from the
regression models and are reported in Tables 1 and 2.
To estimate the risk of preterm or SGA birth, we generated separate models for pregnancy
planning and timing. In addition to the independent, binary exposures of planning and
timing, we created a 4-level exposure variable: (1) women with an unplanned pregnancy
occurring at a bad time, (2) women with an unplanned pregnancy occurring at a good time,
(3) women with a planned pregnancy occurring at a bad time, and (4) women with a planned
pregnancy occurring at a good time (reference category). Analyses were conducted using
SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The cohort is comprised of 2654 women with singleton, live births who completed the initial
interview assessing exposures of pregnancy planning and timing status, after exclusion of
women with multiple births, miscarriage, stillbirth, abortion, and withdrawals. Data on birth
outcomes were available for 99%. Of these 2654 women, 2487 (94%) completed at least 1
of the 2 remaining interviews (at 28 weeks EGA or 8 weeks postpartum), and 2008 women
(83%) completed both (34).
Our study population was primarily white (73.7%), educated (56.6% of women reported 16
or more years of education), married or living with a partner (87%), and older (mean age 31,
83.5% age 25 or older). Table 1 presents demographic and other characteristics for all
participants, and compares those with term versus preterm pregnancies.

Thirty-seven percent of participants reported unplanned pregnancies and 13% reported that
it was not a good time to be pregnant (Table 1). Information on pregnancy planning was
missing for 3 participants and information on pregnancy timing was missing for 23
participants. Approximately 8.5% of participants experienced a preterm birth and 8.3%
delivered a SGA infant. Information on birth weight was missing for 4 participants.
Compared to women with planned or well-timed pregnancies, multivariate adjusted models
did not support the hypothesis that women with unplanned pregnancies had a significantly
higher probability of preterm (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.18, 95% CI 0.85-1.65) or SGA birth (OR
1.17, 95% CI 0.69-1.97), or that women reporting a poorly timed pregnancy had a
significantly higher probability of preterm (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53-1.38) or SGA birth (OR
0.92, 95% CI 0.65-1.29) (Tables 1 and 2). Covariates that were significantly associated with
an increased odds of preterm birth included: previous preterm birth (OR 4.43, 95% CI
3.00-6.52) and panic disorder during pregnancy (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.08-3.71) (Table 1).
Maternal age 25 to 34 years was associated with a lower risk of preterm birth (OR 0.62, 95%
CI 0.44-0.86) (Table 1) compared to age 35 and greater. For SGA, less than 12 years of
education (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.01-3.35) and cigarette use (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.19-2.65) was
associated with higher risk, while history of 1 or more previous births (OR 0.69, 95% CI
0.50-0.95) was associated with a lower risk of SGA (Table 2). Neither pregnancy planning
nor timing, modelled as a 4-level exposure variable, in logistic regression and adjusted for
the above covariates showed a significant association with preterm birth or SGA (Table 3
and 4).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In this prospective cohort study, we found no significant association between pregnancy
planning and pregnancy timing and the risk of preterm or SGA birth. A major strength of
these findings includes analysis of data from a large, carefully characterized cohort of
women who were prospectively assessed during early pregnancy for planning and timing.
Outcome data were collected from medical record abstraction, rather than self-report, and
the analysis was robust in its adjustment for multiple confounding factors.
Previous studies demonstrating a significant increase in preterm (10-15,16,17) or SGA births
(3,10,11,13,14,17-22) among unplanned pregnancies have multiple methodological
limitations. Most studies showing a positive association relied on retrospective assessment
of pregnancy intention,(3,10-15,17-22) which may be subject to recall and reporting bias
(2,52). Prospective longitudinal analyses of pregnancy planning and timing demonstrate that
women’s answers change over time, especially after childbirth and women are more likely
to report a pregnancy as planned, possibly due to rationalization (2,52). Women giving birth
to infants with health problems due to prematurity or SGA may also be more likely to report
a pregnancy as unplanned (53). In addition to limitations in exposure assessment, many
studies employed methods to ascertain birth outcomes that are less reliable than review of
individual medical charts, including retrospective parental surveys and use of birth
certificate data (10,12-15, 17, 19, 20, 22). Studies reporting an increased risk of preterm or
SGA births among women with unplanned pregnancies are also hampered by lack of control
for potential confounding variables (11,15,18). In our analyses among women with

unplanned pregnancy, we also found a significant unadjusted odds for preterm birth
(OR1.39, 95% CI 1.05-1.83) which was attenuated and non-significant after adjustment for
confounders. Studies that do not control for confounding factors, such as socioeconomic
status and race, may falsely associate pregnancy planning and timing with preterm and SGA
birth.
There are only 4 studies in the published literature reporting antenatal assessment of
pregnancy planning and timing, with abstracted preterm and SGA birth outcome data from
medical records (16,23,25,26), and only 1 study meeting the same criteria that reports SGA
outcomes (25). Three prospective studies did not find a significant association between
pregnancy planning and timing, and preterm and/or SGA birth (23,25,26) and one study
showed a significant association between pregnancy planning and timing and preterm birth
(SGA not evaluated) (16). However, none of the 4 prospective studies comprehensively
adjusted for potential confounding (16,23,25,26), including lack of adjustment for history of
prior preterm birth (23,26), which is the strongest risk factor for preterm birth (28), and lack
of adjustment for age (16), race (25,26), education (16,25,26), marital status (16,25), mental
health disorders (16,25,26) or use of tobacco (23,26), alcohol (23, 26), or illicit substances
(23,25,26).
Strengths and Limitations
To the best of our knowledge, this analysis of the relationship between pregnancy planning
and timing with preterm birth and SGA is the largest prospective cohort of pregnant women
with individual assessments reported. As noted, previous analyses have evaluated pregnancy
intention retrospectively (e.g. up to 5 years postpartum) (15). Our study also evaluated
comprehensive information on multiple potential confounders, including maternal
demographics, medical conditions, and other risk factors, which improves upon previous
analyses that did not adjust for possible confounders (11,15,18,16,23,25,26). Another
strength of our dataset is that it used two standard measures of pregnancy planning (one
direct question about whether the pregnancy was planned and a second question about
whether the timing of pregnancy was good) that were asked during the first interview, before
18 weeks EGA, prior to birth outcomes. Finally, our study reviewed medical records of all
participants to capture robust outcome measurements for gestational age and birth weight at
delivery, instead of using administrative data (birth certificates) or retrospective survey
responses from parents (10,12-15, 17, 19, 20, 22).
This dataset is limited by its assessment of pregnancy planning and timing by the 2 measures
used. While these 2 assessments are standard measures, they have been criticized as being
imprecise. For example, many find fault with the assumption that pregnancy is a conscious
and deliberate decision for women (2,52-56) and point out that a dichotomous response
option does not account for the approximately 30-60% of women who may be ambivalent
about pregnancy planning (52,57). Therefore, this analysis may have been enriched by more
in-depth questions, such as whether pregnancy was unplanned but desired or unplanned and
undesired, and by including questions about prenatal preparation and whether pregnancy
was discussed with and agreed upon by the male partner (55,58). Analysis of pregnancy
desirability would also benefit from multiple longitudinal assessments, with questions

repeated at each study visit. To further address issues of reverse causality, it would have
been helpful to assess perceived stress and social support before pregnancy and throughout
pregnancy, since they may be acting as mediators for the relationship between unplanned
pregnancy and preterm birth.
Generalizability of our findings may be limited by the characteristics of study participants.
Compared to national statistics, participants in this cohort exhibited a similar rate of
unplanned pregnancy (40% vs. 37%), but a lower rate of preterm birth (11.6% vs. 8.5%),
respectively. Compared to regional statistics from the same time period (2005-2009),
participants in this cohort exhibited a lower rate of preterm birth (on average 10.4% in
Connecticut and 11.1% in Massachusetts vs. 8.5%), respectively (32). Our cohort was also
predominantly 25-34 years old, white and non-Hispanic, highly educated, married or living
with a partner, and therefore our findings may not be applicable to other populations of
pregnant women. Furthermore, potential participants who chose to terminate their pregnancy
were excluded from this study as the main outcome was preterm birth. Since women with
unplanned, undesired pregnancies are more likely to choose abortion, it is not surprising that
our cohort would have a relatively high population of planned pregnancies, occurring at a
good time in women’s lives.
Among our cohort, having an unplanned or poorly timed pregnancy was not associated with
preterm or SGA birth. However, future research examining whether pregnancy planning and
timing is associated with preterm or SGA birth in specific sub-groups of high-risk women is
warranted, utilizing prospective assessments of pregnancy planning and timing, medical
record abstraction to optimize validity of clinical outcome measures, and collection of
salient information on potential confounding variables. If pregnancy planning and/or timing
is associated with preterm or SGA birth in some groups of high-risk women, targeted
screening and interventions could improve maternal and neonatal health.
