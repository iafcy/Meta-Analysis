Pregnancy planning and acceptance
and maternal psychological distress
during pregnancy: results from the National
Perinatal Survey, France, 2016

Abstract
Background: Studies report heightened risks of mental health problems among women who experience an unin-
tended pregnancy, but few consider the complexity of pregnancy intentions. In this study, we evaluate how different
dimensions of pregnancy intentions (pregnancy planning and pregnancy acceptance) relate to two maternal depres-
sive symptoms and perceived psychological distress.
Methods: This study draws from a cross-sectional national survey conducted in all maternities in France over a one-
week period in 2016. All mothers 18 years and older who had a live birth during the study period were invited to par-
ticipate. After excluding women who underwent infertility treatment, our analytical sample included 10,339 women.
We first described levels and correlates of pregnancy planning and acceptance, defined in four categories; planned/
welcomed, unplanned/welcomed, planned/unwelcomed, unplanned/unwelcomed. We then assessed the bivariate
and multivariate associations between pregnancy planning and acceptance and two outcomes: women’s self-per-
ceived psychological health and the presence of two depressive symptoms during pregnancy. We used multivariate
logistic regressions to evaluate these associations, after adjusting for socio-demographic and medical factors.
Results: Altogether 7.5 to 24.1% of mothers perceived their psychological health during pregnancy was poor,
according to pregnancy planning and acceptance categories and 10.3 to 22.4% indicated feelings of sadness and loss
of interest during pregnancy, according to pregnancy planning and acceptance categories. As compared to women
with planned/welcomed pregnancies, the odds of perceived poor psychological health and depressive symptoms
were 2.55 times (CI 2.20–2.95) and 1.75 times higher (CI 1.51–2.02), respectively, among unplanned/unwelcomed
pregnancies and 2.02 (CI 1.61–2.53) and 2.07 (CI 1.7–2.5) higher, among planned/unwelcomed pregnancies. Among
women with unplanned pregnancies, we also found higher odds of perceived poor psychological health among
women whose pregnancy was unwelcomed while the odds of depressive symptoms were not different by pregnancy
planning status among women with unwelcomed pregnancies.
Conclusions: These findings consolidate previous reports of the association between pregnancy intentions and
maternal psychological distress, while further specifying the relationship, which mostly depends on the acceptance
