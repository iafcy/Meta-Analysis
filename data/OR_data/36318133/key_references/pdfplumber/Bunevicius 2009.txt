Abstract
Objective. To assess the prevalence of antenatal depressive disorder in different trimesters and to evaluate the relation of
psychosocial risk factors to antenatal depressive disorder. Design. Cohort follow-up. Setting. University Hospital, Kaunas,
Lithuania. Sample. Two hundred and thirty pregnant women consecutively admitted. Methods. At 12(cid:1)16 weeks, 22(cid:1)26
weeks, and 32(cid:1)36 weeks of pregnancy, participants were screened for depression using the World Health Organization’s
CompositeInternationalDiagnosticInterviewShortForm(CIDI-SF).Womenwhogaveatleastonepositiveanswertothe
CIDI-SF depression-screening question were evaluated for depressive disorder using the non-patient version of the
StructuredClinicalInterviewforDSM-III-R(SCID-NP).PsychosocialstressorsandtwoBigFivePersonalitydimensions,
neuroticism and extraversion, were also evaluated. Main outcome measures. Prevalence of depressive disorder. Results. The
prevalence of the antenatal depressive disorder at 12(cid:1)16 weeks’ gestation was 6.1%, at 22(cid:1)26 weeks 3.5%, and at 32(cid:1)36
weeks 4.4%. In the first trimester, a greater prevalence of current depressive disorder was independently associated with
unplannedandunwantedpregnancy,highneuroticism,loweducation,andaprevioushistoryofdepression;inthesecond
trimester with unplanned and unwanted pregnancy and high neuroticism; in the third trimester with unplanned and
unwantedpregnancy,highneuroticism,andtheoccurrenceofpsychosocialstressorsduringthelastyear.Conclusions.The
highest prevalence of depressive disorders was found in the first trimester, the lowest in mid-pregnancy. Several
determinants(unwantedandunplannedpregnancy,highneuroticism)wereindependentpredictorsofantenataldepressive
disorders throughout whole pregnancy, while other determinants (low education, previous history of depression, the
occurrence of psychosocial stressorsatthe end of pregnancy)weretrimester specific.
