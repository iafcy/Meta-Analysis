Abstract
Background—Pregnancy planning and timing may be associated with psychiatric illness,
psychological distress and support during pregnancy.
Methods—We performed secondary analyses of a prospective cohort of 2,654 pregnant women
evaluating the impact of depression on preterm birth. We used multivariable logistic regression to
test associations between pregnancy planning (“Was this pregnancy planned? Yes/No”) and/or
timing (“Do you think this is a good time for you to be pregnant?”) with Composite International
Diagnostic Interview generated psychiatric diagnoses and measures of psychological distress and
support.
Results—37% and 13% of participants reported an unplanned or poorly timed pregnancy,
respectively. Unplanned pregnancies were associated with a Major Depressive Episode (MDE)
(adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.69, 95%CI 1.23–2.32) and the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale’s
(CPSS) highest quartile (aOR 1.74, 95%CI 1.40–2.16). Poorly timed pregnancies were associated
with a MDE (aOR 3.47, 95%CI 2.46–4.91) and the CPSS’s highest quartile (aOR 5.20, 95%CI
3.93–6.87). Poorly timed pregnancies were also associated with General Anxiety Disorder (GAD;
aOR 1.60, 95%CI 1.07–2.40), and the modified Kendler Social Support Inventory’s (MKSSI)

lowest quartile (aOR 1.64, 95%CI 1.25–2.16). Psychiatric conditions were strongly associated
with planned pregnancies that were subsequently deemed poorly timed (MDE=aOR 5.08, 95%CI
2.52–10.25; GAD=aOR 2.28, 95%CI 1.04–5.03); high CPSS=aOR 6.48, 95%CI 3.59–11.69; and
low MKSSI=aOR 3.19, 95%CI 1.81–5.62).
Limitations—Participant characteristics may limit generalizability of findings.
Conclusions—Pregnancy timing was a stronger predictor of maternal psychiatric illness,
psychological distress and low social support than pregnancy planning in our cohort.

INTRODUCTION
More than half (51%) of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned (Finer and
Zolna, 2014), which includes pregnancies that are unintended, mistimed, or unwanted (Finer
and Zolna, 2014; Santelli et al., 2009). The multi-dimensionality of pregnancy planning and
timing also encompasses the seemingly disparate circumstances of unplanned pregnancies
that occur at a good time and planned pregnancies that are subsequently assessed to be
poorly timed (Santelli et al., 2009). For example, whether a pregnancy was planned 3
months ago does not necessarily reflect the evolving circumstances of relationships,
employment, or housing.
Unplanned pregnancies resulting in live births (37% of all births) (Finer and Zolna, 2014;
Santelli et al., 2009) are associated with poor maternal and neonatal outcomes including
delayed prenatal care, increased physical violence, low birth weight, reduced breastfeeding,
decreased inter–pregnancy intervals, and increased risk of lower educational attainment and
behavioral issues for children from unplanned pregnancies (Brown and Eisenberg, 1995;
Cheng et al., 2009; Cleland et al., 2011; Logan et al., 2007). Whether unplanned pregnancy
is associated with maternal psychiatric illness or psychological distress and low social
support is not clear.
During pregnancy, approximately 8.3% to 12.7% of U.S. women experience a major
depressive episode (MDE), and 16.7% to 24.6% experience depressive symptoms (Bennett
et al., 2004; Gaynes et al., 2005; Grote et al., 2010). Maternal depression during pregnancy
is associated with poor maternal and neonatal outcomes; Dayan et al., 2006; Gipson et al.,
2008; Grigoriadis et al., 2013; Grote et al., 2010; Khashan et al., 2014; Orr et al., 2002);
however, data are inconclusive (Yonkers et al., 2011). Some U.S. studies find an association
between unplanned pregnancy and depressive symptoms during the pregnancy (Barber et al.,
1999; Fellenzer and Cibula, 2014; Messer et al., 2005; Orr and Miller, 1997) while others do
not (Lancaster et al., 2010; Maximova and Quesnel-Vallée, 2009; Maxson and Miranda,
2011; Phipps and Nunes, 2012). However, these studies were limited by lack of adjustment
for confounding by race (Barber et al., 1999), parity (Barber et al., 1999; Fellenzer and
Cibula, 2014; Messer et al., 2005; Orr and Miller, 1997), history of mental health disorders
(Barber et al., 1999; Fellenzer and Cibula, 2014; Messer et al., 2005; Orr and Miller, 1997),

use of tobacco or illicit substances (Messer et al., 2005; Orr and Miller, 1997), and by using
non-validated measures of depression (Fellenzer and Cibula, 2014; Phipps and Nunes,
2012), and retrospective assessments of pregnancy intention and depressive symptoms
(Barber et al., 1999; Fellenzer and Cibula, 2014) which may be subject to recall and
reporting bias (Santelli et al., 2009). If unplanned or poorly timed pregnancy is associated
with depression, antenatal screening for unplanned pregnancy could identify pregnant
women at increased risk of depressive symptoms that may be amenable to treatment
interventions.
Approximately 8.5% of women experience General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) during
pregnancy, (Ross and McLean, 2006) which may elevate the risk for poor neonatal outcomes
(Dunkel Schetter and Tanner, 2012; Kramer et al., 2009). Previous studies have not found an
association between unplanned pregnancy and anxiety (Sayil et al., 2006; Tenkku et al.,
2009), but are limited by retrospective (postpartum) assessment of pregnancy planning
(Sayil et al., 2006) or inconsistent assessment of pregnancy planning (Tenkku et al., 2009)
that can bias results (Santelli et al., 2009).
Perceived psychological stress during pregnancy, referring to the degree that life events are
uncontrollable or unpredictable, is linked with depression and panic disorder (Maxson and
Miranda, 2011; Woods et al., 2010). Furthermore, perceived stress during pregnancy is
associated with adverse birth outcomes (Dunkel Schetter, 2011). While previous studies
demonstrate a significant association between unplanned pregnancy and perceived stress
(Maxson and Miranda, 2011; Messer et al., 2005; Orr and Miller, 1997), most studies did not
address potential confounding factors (Messer et al., 2005; Orr and Miller, 1997).
Positive social support is one of the most effective methods for coping with stress and is
associated with decreased depression and anxiety, decreased time to recovery from illness,
and even reduction in mortality (Kim et al., 2008). In pregnancy, women with higher levels
of social support demonstrate better mental health outcomes (Balaji et al., 2007). Lack of
social support, is associated with giving birth to a small for gestational age infant (Dunkel
Schetter, 2011). Some researchers find that unplanned pregnancy is associated with lower
levels of social support (Orr and Miller, 1997; Sable et al., 2007). Again, the literature is
inconsistent (Maxson and Miranda, 2011), and limited by lack of adjustment for
confounding (Orr and Miller, 1997; Sable et al., 2007), small sample size (Sable et al.,
2007), and use of non-validated measurement tools for social support (Orr and Miller, 1997).
We investigated the association between unplanned or poorly timed pregnancy and maternal
symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress and social support. We hypothesized that
women with unplanned or poorly timed pregnancies would have greater psychiatric
morbidity (MDE, GAD), greater perceived stress, and lower reported social support than
those with planned and well-timed pregnancies.

METHODS
Recruitment, Enrollment, and Assessment Procedures
We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study designed to explore the
associations of major depressive episodes or antidepressant medication use in pregnancy
with adverse birth outcomes, including the risk for preterm birth (Yonkers et al., 2011;
Yonkers et al., 2012). Secondary analyses were pre-planned and funded by the Yale Center
for Clinical Investigation. Women were eligible for the parent study if they were at least 18
years of age or more (16 years at the Yale site), less than 18 weeks estimated gestational age
with a singleton pregnancy, spoke English or Spanish, and had access to a telephone. All
potentially eligible women with a history of antidepressant use or a major depressive episode
in the last 5 years were invited to participate. For the comparison group, one-third of
potentially eligible women without these characteristics were randomly selected and invited
to participate in the study. Women were deemed ineligible if they had insulin-dependent
diabetes which was an independent risk factor for preterm birth, plans to terminate their
pregnancy since only women with continuing pregnancies could be at risk of preterm birth,
or intention to relocate. The original study size was calculated to show a 2-fold difference in
preterm birth among women exposed to depression or antidepressant medication, compared
to those who were not exposed, with 85% power assuming a 5% preterm birth rate (Yonkers
et al., 2012). Yale University School of Medicine and participating hospitals provided
human subjects approval for the study.
Study staff recruited and enrolled pregnant women receiving prenatal care from 137
obstetrical practices and hospital-based clinics in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts
between March 2005 and May 2009. Study follow-up continued until September 2009. Staff
obtained verbal consent from participants and administered a screening questionnaire to
collect information on gestational age, current mood, lifetime and current mood and anxiety
disorders, antidepressant treatment, and exclusion criteria.
Selected participants provided written consent for study interviews and medical record
review, and completed an initial home interview before 18 weeks estimated gestational age
(EGA). Staff interviewed participants again by phone at 28 (± 2) weeks gestation and 8 (± 4)
weeks after delivery. All staff interviewers received extensive training including at least 4
days of instruction and 4 supervised interviews.
Exposure and Outcome Measures
At the initial interview, interviewers obtained data on demographic and potential
confounding variables, including mental health outcomes. Maternal age, race, ethnicity,
education, marital status, parity, pregnancy history including previous preterm birth, tobacco
use, alcohol use, other illicit drug use, and medication use was collected. The Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), and the
modified Kendler Social Support Interview (MKSSI) were administered at the first visit
(Cohen and Williamson, 1988; Cox and Holden, 1994; Spoozak et al., 2009). The CPSS
evaluates the degree to which individuals feel that life events are unpredictable and
uncontrollable (Cohen and Williamson, 1988). The MKSSI is a reliable and valid tool for

assessing social support (emotional and instrumental support) in pregnant women (Spoozak
et al., 2009).
At each of the three interviews, participants answered questions about major depressive
disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder from the World Mental Health
Composite International Diagnostic Interview v2.1 (WMH-CIDI) (WHO, 1997). The WMH-
CIDI is a valid and reliable lay interview instrument whether administered in person or over
the telephone, is accepted for use in pregnant women, and is further described in previous
publications regarding this study (Yonkers et al., 2011; Yonkers et al., 2012). Perceived
stress, and social support were not assessed at the second or third visit.
We measured the exposure of interest at the first study visit (before 18 weeks EGA).
Interviewers assessed pregnancy intention by asking women whether their pregnancy was
planned (“Was this pregnancy planned? Yes/No”), and whether they thought it was a good
time for them to be pregnant (“Do you think this is a good time for you to be pregnant? Yes/
No”).
We used standard of care definitions and validated tools for outcome measurements. A
standard algorithm for the WMH-CIDI was used to determine whether a participant likely
met criteria for a MDE or GAD during pregnancy. A score of greater than or equal to 20 on
the CPSS represented the highest quartile and defined highest perceived stress during
pregnancy. A score of 3.2 or less on the MKSSI represented the lowest quartile and defined
lowest social support during pregnancy. Gestational age was verified by a first-trimester
ultrasound where available, last menstrual period, due date set by a physician, or earliest
prenatal ultrasound.
Statistical Analysis
We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the association of pregnancy planning
and timing with depression, anxiety, perceived stress and social support, and calculated
unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios, controlling for potential confounding variables. We
identified possible demographic factors (chosen a priori) that might confound the
relationship between pregnancy planning or timing and maternal psychological distress and
social support outcomes. Mother’s age, education, race, marital status, history of sexual
abuse prior to age 18, use of tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs, depression (major depression 6
months before pregnancy and/or during pregnancy), panic disorder, benzodiazepine use
during pregnancy, and stress are all correlates of pregnancy planning/timing, and/or maternal
psychological distress, and/or social support (Bayrampour et al., 2015; Brown and
Eisenberg, 1995; Cheng et al., 2009; Fellenzer and Cibula, 2014; Finer and Zolna, 2014;
Hall et al., 2014; Nunes and Phipps, 2013; Yonkers et al., 2014). To estimate the risk of
MDE, GAD, high perceived stress, and low social support, we generated separate logistic
regression models for pregnancy planning and timing. In addition to the binary exposures of
planning and timing, we created a 4-level exposure variable: (1) women with an unplanned
pregnancy occurring at a bad time, (2) women with an unplanned pregnancy occurring at a
good time, (3) women with a planned pregnancy occurring at a bad time, and (4) women
with a planned pregnancy occurring at a good time (reference category). Final multivariable
models were developed using backwards selection at α=0.10 significance level. We also

tested the interaction term for panic disorder and history of sexual abuse prior to age 18 in
each multivariable model. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Our cohort included 2654 women with singleton, live births who completed the initial
interview assessing exposures of pregnancy planning and timing status, after excluding
women with multiple births, miscarriage, stillbirth, abortion, and withdrawals. Data on
psychological distress and social support outcomes were available for more than 99% of
participants. Of these 2654 women, 2487 (94%) completed at least 1 of the 2 remaining
interviews (at 28 weeks EGA or 8 weeks postpartum) (Yonkers et al., 2012).
Table 1 presents demographic and other characteristics for all participants across maternal
psychological distress and support outcomes. Our study population was primarily white
(73.7%), educated (56.6% of women reported 16 or more years of education), married or
living with a partner (87%), and older (mean age 31, 83.5% age 25 or older). Overall, 37%
of participants reported unplanned pregnancies and 13% reported that it was not a good time
to be pregnant (Table 1). Information on pregnancy planning was missing for 3 participants
and information on pregnancy timing was missing for 23 participants. Approximately 8% of
participants were in episode for MDE, 9% GAD, 28% scored in the highest quartile for
perceived stress, and 23% scored in the lowest quartile for social support. Information on
perceived stress was missing for 15 participants.
Results of multivariate unadjusted models are presented in Table 2 and results of
multivariate adjusted models are presented in Table 3. In multivariate adjusted models,
unplanned pregnancies were significantly associated with MDE (aOR 1.69, 95% CI 1.23–
2.32) and were more likely to score in the highest quartile of the CPSS (aOR 1.74, 95% CI
1.40–2.16).
In multivariate adjusted models, pregnancies occurring at a bad time were associated with
MDE (aOR 3.47, 95% CI 2.46–4.91) and GAD (aOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.07–2.40), and were
more likely to score in the highest quartile of the CPSS (aOR 5.20, 95% CI 3.93–6.87) and
the lowest quartile of the MKSSI (aOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.25–2.16).
In multivariate adjusted models examining pregnancy planning and timing as a 4-level
exposure variable, the largest estimates were observed among women reporting planned
pregnancies not occurring at a good time, which was significantly associated with MDE
(aOR 5.08, 95% CI 2.52–10.25), GAD (aOR 2.28, 95% CI 1.04–5.03), the highest quartile
of the CPSS (aOR 6.48, 95% CI 3.59–11.69), and the lowest quartile of the MKSSI (aOR
3.19, 95% CI 1.81–5.62), compared to those with planned, well-timed pregnancies.
Pregnancies that were unplanned and poorly timed were significantly associated with MDE
(aOR 3.70, 95% CI 2.46–5.58), GAD (aOR 1.73, 95% CI 1.06–2.81), and the highest
quartile of the CPSS (aOR 6.03, 95% CI 4.35–8.38), but not significantly associated the
lowest quartile of the MKSSI (aOR 1.24, 95% CI 0.89–1.75). Pregnancies that were

unplanned and well-timed were only associated with the highest quartile of the CPSS (aOR
1.41, 95% CI 1.11–1.80).
DISCUSSION
In this secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study, we found that pregnancy planning
and pregnancy timing were significantly associated with maternal psychiatric morbidity,
psychological distress and poor social support outcomes during pregnancy. Compared to
women with unplanned pregnancies, women who reported poorly timed pregnancies showed
significant associations with all four maternal mental health outcomes (MDE, GAD, stress,
and social support). Pregnancy timing was a better predictor of poor maternal psychological
distress and support outcomes than pregnancy planning in our cohort. In fact, the largest
effect size for associations with psychiatric morbidity in our 4-level multivariate models
were observed among women with pregnancies that were planned but poorly timed,
followed by pregnancies that were unplanned and poorly timed. However, we note that
confidence intervals for these two groups overlap for some outcomes (MDE, GAD, and
perceived stress) and we cannot say for certain that they differ from each other.
To the best of our knowledge, this analysis of the relationship between pregnancy planning
and timing with psychosocial distress and support is the largest published prospective cohort
of pregnant women with individual assessments reported. Our study was robust in its
adjustment for multiple potential confounders, including maternal demographics, medical
conditions, and other risk factors, which improves upon previous analyses that did not
account for these potential contributing factors (Messer et al., 2005; Orr and Miller, 1997;
Phipps and Nunez, 2012; Sable et al., 2007). An additional strength is the systematic
collection of psychological outcome data on dimensional measures of distress (eg. Cohen
PSS, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and syndromal diagnoses for a MDE or GAD
using multiple validated measures of both symptoms and diagnostic criteria. Another
strength of our study is its use of two questions about pregnancy intention (one direct
question about whether the pregnancy was planned and a second question about whether the
timing of pregnancy was good) that were asked during the first interview, before 18 weeks’
EGA, before birth outcomes. Importantly, this early assessment decreases the risk of recall
and social desirability biases.
Characteristics of study participants may limit the generalizability of our findings. Our
cohort was primarily 25–34 years old, white and non-Hispanic, highly educated, married or
living with a partner, and therefore our findings may not be applicable to other populations
of pregnant women. Furthermore, potential participants who chose to terminate their
pregnancy were excluded from this study as the main outcome was preterm birth. Since
women with unplanned, undesired pregnancies are more likely to choose pregnancy
termination, it is not surprising that our cohort would have a relatively high population of
planned pregnancies, occurring at a good time in women’s lives. Despite this, participants in
this cohort exhibited a similar rate of unplanned pregnancy compared to national statistics
(37% in ours and 40% nationally (Finer and Zolna, 2014)), and similar prevalence of
depression and anxiety compared to national statistics (Bennett et al., 2004; Gaynes et al.,
2005; Grote et al., 2010). Nevertheless, our findings may not be applicable to women with

unplanned and/or poorly timed pregnancies that choose pregnancy termination. We also did
not collect information on family history of psychiatric illness, which could potentially
confound our results.
We cannot comment on causality with this analysis. It may be that an unplanned or poorly
timed pregnancy contributed to the onset of an MDE or to GAD, or the existence of these
illnesses may have contributed to an assessment of the pregnancy as unplanned or poorly
timed. The endorsement of poor timing showed a particularly strong association with an
MDE. Furthermore, our study supports the importance of multi-dimensional assessments of
pregnancy planning and timing (Santelli et al., 2009) and strengthens our understanding of
the association between maternal psychiatric morbidity, psychological distress and poor
social support with poorly timed pregnancies, especially among those that are initially
planned. Some women may plan a pregnancy and then have a serious life event (e.g. illness,
relationship disruption) that leads them to characterize the pregnancy as poorly timed and
may be contributing to the mental illness episodes.
Our findings have important implications for future research and for women’s pregnancy
care. Future studies that include assessment of pregnancy planning and timing, MDE, GAD,
perceived stress, and social support before, during, and after pregnancy would contribute to
further understanding of causality. During pregnancy care, screening for pregnancy timing
and planning among newly pregnant women may help identify women at increased risk for
depression, anxiety, high perceived stress and low social support, and contribute to more
effective pregnancy options counseling. If identified, women may benefit from targeted
interventions that can decrease their psychiatric burden and risk of poor maternal mental
health outcomes.
Our study adds to a body of research aimed at understanding the effects of pregnancy
planning and timing on women’s mental health. Among our cohort, unplanned and/or poorly
timed pregnancies were associated with psychiatric illness or psychological distress and
poor social support. Our findings reinforce the recent recommendation from the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, 2015) and from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (O’Connor
et al., 2016) to screen and provide appropriate treatment for depression and anxiety at least
once during the perinatal period for all pregnant women, and to screen more often for
women with risk factors such as unplanned and/or poorly timed pregnancies.

HIGHLIGHTS
• Unclear if unplanned/poorly timed pregnancies associated with
psychological distress
• Prior analyses limited by methodological limitations; no adjustment for
confounding
• Current study: Individual assessments in large prospective cohort of
pregnant women
• Key Findings:
○ Unplanned and poorly timed pregnancies significantly
associated with MDE & high stress
○ Poorly timed pregnancies associated with GAD and low
social support
○ Worst outcomes for planned pregnancies that were
subsequently deemed poorly timed
• Findings support screening for unplanned/poorly timed pregnancy
during prenatal care
