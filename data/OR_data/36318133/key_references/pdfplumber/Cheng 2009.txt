Abstract
Background:Thisstudywasconductedtodeterminetherelationshipbetweenunintendedpregnancyandmaternalbehaviorsbefore,during
andafter pregnancy.
StudyDesign:Datawereanalyzedfromastratifiedrandomsampleof9048motherswhodeliveredliveborninfantsbetween2001and2006

regression methods with appropriate survey weightswere usedtocontrol for socio-demographic factors.
Results: Compared to women with intended pregnancies, mothers with unwanted pregnancies were more likely to consume less than the

(OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.5–2.9), smoke postpartum (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.35–2.55) and report postpartum depression (OR 1.98, 95% CI

Conclusion: Even after controlling for multiple socio-demographic factors, unwanted and mistimed pregnancies were associated with
unhealthy perinatal behaviors.
