Pregnancy Intention, Demographic Differences,
and Psychosocial Health
Pamela Maxson, Ph.D., and Marie Lynn Miranda, Ph.D.
Abstract
Objectives: We explore the psychosocial, demographic, and maternal characteristics across wanted, mistimed,
and unwanted pregnancies.
Methods: Data from 1321 women from a prospective cohort study of pregnant women in Durham, NC, are
analyzed.Psychosocialcorrelateswereobtainedthroughprenatalsurveys;electronicmedicalrecordswereused
to ascertain maternal health and pregnancy outcomes.
Results:Sixty-twopercentofthewomenindicatedanunintendedpregnancy,with44%(578)mistimedand18%
(245) unwanted. Only 38% of the pregnancies were characterized as wanted. Women with unwanted and with
mistimedpregnanciesweresimilardemographically,buttheydifferedsignificantlyonpsychosocialprofilesand
maternal characteristics. Women with mistimed and with wanted pregnancies differed in demographics and
psychosocial profiles. Wanted pregnancies had the healthiest, mistimed an intermediate, and unwanted the
poorest psychosocial profile. Women with unwanted pregnancies had the highest depression, perceived stress,
andnegativepaternalsupportscores(p<0.05)andthelowestself-efficacy,socialsupport,andpositivepaternal
supportscores(p<0.05).Inmultivariateanalyses,womenwithriskierpsychosocialprofileshadhigheroddsof
being in the unwanted category. Controlling for psychosocial and demographic variables, perceived stress and
positive paternal support remained significant predictors of belonging to the unwanted and mistimed groups.
Conclusions:Fullycharacterizingpregnancyintentionanditsrelationshiptopsychosocialprofilesmayprovide
a basis for identifying women with highest risk during pregnancy and early motherhood. Women with un-
wanted and mistimed pregnancies may appear similar demographically but are different psychosocially. Wo-
men with unwanted pregnancies have multiple risk factors and would benefit from targeted interventions.

Discussion
This analysis examined the maternal and psychosocial
contributors to intention status in an ongoing prospective
cohort study. In our sample, the unwanted and mistimed
pregnancies were similar demographically but markedly
different on psychosocial health measures and maternal
characteristics. Unwanted pregnancies also differed from
wanted pregnancies demographically and psychosocially.
The mistimed and wanted groups differed in both areas as
well.
