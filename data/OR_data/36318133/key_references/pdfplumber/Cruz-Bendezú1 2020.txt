Abstract
Background: Nearly half of all pregnancies inthe United States are reported as unintended and rates are highest
among women oflow socioeconomicstatus.The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between
unintended pregnancies and maternal mentalhealth and timing ofprenatal care among low-income women.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 870 women, whom were participating intheFirst 1000Days program in
threecommunityhealth centers in theBoston area,were enrolled attheir first prenatal visit from August 2016 –
September 2017. We assessed pregnancy intentionby self-report using the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring
System. We used self-reported survey information and electronic health record data to assess thefollowing
outcomes: current stress,current depression, and timing ofinitial prenatal visit. We used multivariable logistic
regression models to examine associations and adjusted for sociodemographic factors.
Results: Women were a mean (SD) age of 29.3 (6.1), and 39.2%reported that their pregnancy was unintended.
50.6% ofwomen were Hispanic, 28.4%were White, 10.1% were Black, and 10.9%were other races. 78.9% ofwomen
reported an annual household income <$50,000. Overall, 26.7%of women reported current stress, 8.2% reported
current depression, and 18.3%of women initiated prenatal care after their first trimester. In multivariable analyses,
women with unintended pregnancies had higher odds of experiencingcurrentstress (OR: 1.72; 95%CI: 1.22, 2.41),
current depression(OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.04, 3.20), and initiationof prenatal care post-first trimester (OR: 1.84; 95% CI:
1.23, 2.74).
Conclusions: Unintendedpregnancieswere associated with current stress and depression, and delayed prenatal
care inthis sample oflow-income women suggestingthe importance of identifying high-risk women and tailoring
interventions to supportwomen’s needs.
Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03191591; Retrospectively registered on June 19,2017).
