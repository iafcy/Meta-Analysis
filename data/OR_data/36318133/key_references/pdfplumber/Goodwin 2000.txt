Objective: This study examines whether unintended pregnancy is associated with physical
abuse of women occurring around the time of pregnancy, independent of other factors.
Methods: In 1996–1997, state-specific population-based datawere obtained from the Preg-
nancyRiskAssessmentMonitoringSystem(PRAMS)from39,348womenin14stateswho
had delivered a live-born infant within the previous 2–6 months. The study questionnaire
askedabout maternalbehaviorsand characteristicsaroundthe timeof pregnancy. Results:
Womenwhohadmistimedorunwantedpregnanciesreportedsignificantlyhigherlevelsof
abuseatanytimeduringthe12monthsbeforeconceptionorduringpregnancy(12.6%and
15.3%, respectively) compared with those with intended pregnancies (5.3%). Higher rates
ofabusewerereportedbywomenwhowereyounger,Black,unmarried,lesseducated,on
Medicaid, living in crowded conditions, entering prenatal care late, or smoking during the
third trimester. Overall, women with unintended pregnancies had 2.5 times the risk of
experiencing physical abuse compared with those whose pregnancies were intended. This
association was modified by maternal characteristics; the association was strongest among
women who were older, more educated, White, married, not on Medicaid, not living in
crowdedconditions,receivingfirsttrimesterprenatalcare,ornonsmokingduringthethird
trimester.Conclusions:Womenwithunintendedpregnanciesareatincreasedriskofphysical
abusearoundthetimeofpregnancycomparedwithwomenwhosepregnanciesareintended.
