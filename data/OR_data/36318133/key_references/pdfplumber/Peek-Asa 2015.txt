Violenceagainstwomenisamajorpublichealthproblemgarnering
increasedrecognitioninmanydifferentculturesandcountries(ACOG,
1995;Bash,1994;Campbelletal.,1995).DeclarationsmadeattheIn-

andtheIVWorldConferenceonWomeninBeijing(1995)clearlyes-

1994).Violenceagainstwomen,especiallyviolenceperpetratedagainst
a woman by an intimate partner, was recognized to have many ethnic

prevention, and services (Spitz and Marks, 2000; Campbell et al.,
2000).
In countries that collect violence-related data, intimate partner vio-
lencehasbeenfoundtooccuratallincomelevelsandamongalloccu-
pations, social classes, and ethnic and cultural groups (Straus and
Smith, 1990; Torres, 1991; Wilt and Olson, 1996), although percep-
tionsofwhatconstitutesabusemaydiffer(Torres,1991).Culturaldif-
ferences are an important predictor of perceptions and reactions to
abuse, and are especially important when designing intervention poli-
cies and practices (Straus and Smith, 1990; Ghazal and Hoyt, 1993;

or cultural differences (Kaufman et al., 1994; Sorenson and Telles,
1991).Thesedifferencesmaybeparticularlycrucialwhenadaptingtoa

immigrationorintra-culturemarriage.Theroleofculturalperceptions
of partner abuse is especially important in Southern California, which
hasoneofthelargestimmigrantpopulationsintheworld.SouthernCal-
ifornia is home to the largest Mexican-American population, and be-
causeofproximityandeconomicties,remainscloselyrelatedtoMexican
cultureandcustoms.
PrevalenceestimatesofpartnerabuseintheUnitedStatesrangefrom
11% to 65% of women and in Mexico range from 33% to 61% of
women(Arbuckleetal.,1995;Abbotetal.,1996;Diaz-Olavarrietaand
Sotelo,1996).Inbothcountries,intimatepartnersarethemostcommon
perpetratorsoffemalehomicide.Reasonsforthevarianceinprevalence
estimateshavenotyetbeenadequatelyexplained,andthusdifferences
in the prevalence and risk factors for abuse in different populations of
women are largely unknown. Research into the prevalence of abusive
eventshasbeenchallengedbyalackofdefinitionregardingwhatcon-
stitutesabuseandhowthisperceptiondiffersamonggroupsofwomen
(SpitzandMarks,2000;Campbelletal.,2000).Thislackofknowledge
may lead to underestimates of abusive relationships among certain
groupsbecauseofeitheralackoftrustindivulgingexperiencesorthe
perceptionthatcertaineventsarenotabusivewithincertaincultures.
Research in Southern California found that Mexican-born Latinas
had a lower lifetime prevalence of partner abuse than American-born
LatinasandAnglos(SorensonandTelles,1991),butmayalsohavedif-
feringperceptionsaboutwhatconstitutesabuse.Furtherresearchfound
that Anglo-American women perceived more behaviors to be abusive
than did Mexican-American women (Wilt and Olson, 1996). Spe-
cifically,emotionalabuse,suchasfailuretoprovideadequatefoodand
shelter, was perceived as abusive by a larger proportion of Anglo-
American women than Mexican-American women (Wilt and Olson,
1996). Cumulative research findings indicate that cultural and social
factors,includingstressorsassociatedwithacculturationandmigration,

includingsocialsupportstructure,accesstoextendedfamilynetworks,

bleperiodbecausetensionsingenderrelationsmayoccurwithstresses
ofmovingandadaptingtoanewculturalenvironment,especiallywhen
genderrelationsinthecountryoforiginwerepatriarchalorasymmetri-
cal (Dasgupta and Warrier, 1996). However, the relationship between
partnerabuseandculturalcompetenceiscomplicated,andcouldleadto
eitheranincreaseordecreaseinabuse(DasguptaandWarrier,1996).
A more complete understanding of attitudes about what constitutes
an abusive event and how perceptions of the severity of these events
vary will enable health care providers to better identify and assist
women suffering abuse and will also help researchers better describe
culturaldifferencesinrisk.Thepurposeofthisresearchwastoexamine
differences in the perceptions of intimate partner abuse indicators
amongwomenintheUnitedStatesandinMexicotodetermineifsys-
tematicdifferencesintheperceptionofabusiveeventsispresent.This
perceptionsurveywasconductedaspartofalargerstudyexaminingthe

METHODS
The sample population was drawn from women in Los Angeles
County, California, United States and the cities of Cuernavaca and
Cuautla,Morelos,Mexico.Respondentswereaskedtoassignalevelof
perceivedseverityto26indicatorsofintimatepartnerabuse.The26in-
dicatorswerefromascreenusedintheDomesticViolenceinMexican
and Mexican American Women study (DVMMAW) to assess the fre-
quency and severity of intimate partner abuse during pregnancy. The
abusescreenwasadaptedfromtheConflictTacticsScalebyresearch-
ers in Mexico (Castro) for use in both countries (Straus et al., 1996).
The 26 questions on the survey represent physical, sexual, and emo-
tionalabuse,andrangefromlesssevereevents(beinginsulted)tovery

four groups were identified at large universities in each country. The
samplewasnotrandomlydrawn,butthestudyprotocolwasduplicated
exactly in each country. Thus, although the sample is small and non-
random,groupsinthetwocountriesarecomparable.
The mean age of women sampled in the US was 29.2 years, which
was significantly younger than the mean age of 33.2 years in Mexico.

ate,andundergraduatestudentgroups,butamongclericalworkersand

Womenwereapproachedbyastudyresearcherandaskedtopartici-
pate in a written survey about attitudes towards intimate partner vio-
lence. Women were not asked about their experiences with abuse.
Participation was voluntary and anonymous in both countries, and no
incentives were provided. Women were invited to participate without
regard to race/ethnicity. Among the US sample, 81% were born in the
USand91%wereraisedintheUS.
Participantswereinstructedtoreporttheirperceptionsabouttherela-
tive severity of each of the 26 events. Table 3 lists these events in the

drawn ordering. Respondents were instructed to read the 26 items and

follows the principle that each respondent should have consistent re-
sponsesbasedontheirindividualattitudesandopinions,evenifrespon-
dents disagree with one another (Thorndike, 1904; Guttman, 1944).
Thus,arespondentwhoviewsabuseasseverewillbemorelikelytoas-

respondents to use the entire range of 1 to 100. Similarly, the most se-

itemwiththethirdhighestrankingamongUSwomenwasbeingchoked
(logit=21.74)andamongMexicanwomenwasbeingthreatenedwith

A partner becoming jealous or suspicious of friends was ranked as
the least severe item by women in both countries, but this was one of
only two items with a higher severity value among women in Mexico
(USlogit=0.29;Mexicologit=0.24).Beinginsultedbyapartnerwas
rankedasthesecondleastsevereeventamongUSwomenandwasthe
only other event to receive a higher severity value among women in
Mexico (US logit = 0.01; Mexico logit = 20.01). Mexican women
ranked a partner hitting a wall or furniture as the second least severe
event.
Being kicked by a partner led to the greatest difference in ranking.
Although this event was ranked as 5th most severe among Mexican
womenbut12thmostsevereamongUSwomen,USwomenassigneda

USwomenratedphysicalandemotionalviolenceasmoresevere),and
clinicpatients(inwhichUSwomenratedphysicalviolenceasmorese-
vere). Comparisons of group responses within countries showed very
fewdifferences.Thesegrouppatternsindicatethatdifferencesbetween
countries are not driven by any specific group, although graduate stu-
dents may have the strongest role in predicting differences, and that
groupresponseswithincountriesareconsistent.
Intimate partner violence, as a public health issue, is not as widely
discussed among the general public in Mexico as it is in the US (Diaz
Olavarrieta and Sotelo, 1996: Ramirez Rodriguez and Patino Guerra,
1996). Investigators in Mexico have noted that the combination of a
scarcityofinformationandlackofrecognitiononbehalfofpublicinsti-
tutionshavecreatedanenvironmentwithlittleornosocialsupportsfor
victims(Bedregaletal.,1991;DuarteandGonzaalez,1994;Riiqueret
al., 1996). This lack of information could account in part for the large
variationinseverityscoresaswellaslowerperceptionsofseverity.
LosAngeles,withthelargestMexicanpopulationoutsideofMexico
City, is highly influenced by Mexican social and cultural norms. Yet
these norms must mix with different public messages and a different
structureofsocialandhealthservices.Healthcareandserviceproviders
musttakeculturalbeliefsandperceptionsintoaccountwhenassessing
and treating victims of abuse (Campbell et al., 2000; Spitz and Marks,
2000). Screening surveys and tools that are used in multicultural set-
tings should be adequately calibrated to be appropriate for a range of
abuse perceptions. If one culture’s general set of beliefs assigns lower
severitytoeventsindicatingabuse,itispossiblethathealthcareprovid-
ersmayunderestimatetheactuallevelofabusesufferedbyindividuals.
For example, this study indicates that women from Mexico may per-
ceiveeventsofabuseaslesssevere,andinturnmayreportthemasless
severewhenrespondingtoscreeningtools.Oneapproachtosensitizing
suchtoolswouldbetosetarangeofthresholdsindicatingabusewhich
canbeadjustedaccordingtoknownculturalperceptionsofabuse.
Researchers and policymakers must also be aware of how cultural
contextsmayaffectresponsestoabuseandaccessofservices.Women
fromculturesthatfailtorecognizeintimatepartnerviolenceasapublic
healthissueorthathaveahightoleranceforabuseagainstwomenmay
be less likely to seek services. Providers should work within cultural
groups to find appropriate avenues to introduce interventions in these
populations,andinformationabouttheperceptionsofabusewithincul-
turalgroupswillaidinthisprocess(Rodriguez,1999).

Thisstudyincludesasmallsampleofwomenfrombothsampledar-
eas and cannot be generalized to all women. The sample was not ran-
domlydrawn,whichfurtherweakenstheabilitytoextrapolatetolarger

aminationofdifferencesintheperceptionofabuseamongwomen.The
methodologicapproachisappropriateforsuchasample,andtheRasch
model indicates a high degree of internal validity and consistency
withintheresponses.
These findings indicate that there are differences in the overall per-
ceptionofseverityofabuseinthesampleincludedinthisstudy.Future
research within the Mexican and Mexican-American population, as
well as research including other cultural groups, would be valuable to
further describe the relationship between culture and perceptions of
abuse. Studies examining the relationship between acculturation, vic-
timization,andperceptionsofabusecouldfurtherclarifytheroleofcul-
tureinintimatepartnerviolence.
