Abstract
Objectives—Better understanding of the impact of unintended childbearing on infant and early
childhood health is needed for public health practice and policy.
Methods—Data from the 2004-2008 Oklahoma Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System
(PRAMS) survey and The Oklahoma Toddler Survey (TOTS) from 2006-2010 were used to
examine associations between a four category measure of pregnancy intentions (intended,
mistimed<2 years, mistimed>=2 years, unwanted) and maternal behaviors and child health
outcomes up to age two. Propensity score methods were used to control for confounding.
Results—Births mistimed by two or more years (OR =.58) and unwanted births (OR=.33) had
significantly lower odds than intended births of having a mother who recognized the pregnancy
within the first 8 weeks; they were also about half as likely as intended births to receive early
prenatal care, and had significantly higher likelihoods of exposure to cigarette smoke during
pregnancy. Breastfeeding was significantly less likely among unwanted births (OR=.68);
breastfeeding for at least six months was significantly less likely among seriously mistimed births
(OR=.70). We find little association between intention status and early childhood measures.
Conclusions—Measured associations of intention status on health behaviors and outcomes were
most evident in the prenatal period, limited in the immediate prenatal period, and mostly
insignificant by age two. In addition, most of the negative associations between intention status
and health outcomes were concentrated among women with births mistimed by 2 or more years or
unwanted births. Surveys should incorporate questions on the extent of mistiming when measuring
pregnancy intentions.

Introduction
National public health policy is strongly influenced by the expectation that unintended
childbearing has significant negative effects on the behavior of mothers both during
pregnancy and afterward, and that such behaviors directly affect the health and wellbeing of
the child [1,2]. However, recent reviews highlight weak and often inconsistent research
findings on the relationship of pregnancy intentions on maternal behaviors and infant health
[3,4]; the handful of studies on early childhood health and development also show mixed
findings [5-9]. With unintended births making up about two-fifths of all births that occur
each year in the U.S. and little improvement in the past three decades [10], better
understanding of the potential impact of unintended childbearing on infant and early
childhood health is needed for public health practice and policy.
Some of the ambiguity of prior research reflects methodological challenges in this area. Is it
the background characteristics of mothers of intended, mistimed and unwanted births that
account for any observed differences in health behaviors and outcomes, or the intention
status of the birth? In many studies, bivariate differences in outcomes by intention status are
diminished or washed out completely when controls for background characteristics are
added [3]. Second, limited attention has been given to the effect of intention status past
infancy, into early childhood [11]. Third, problems with the measurement and
conceptualization of childbearing intentions further hamper research [12, 13]. Generally,
studies of the consequences of unintended pregnancy have only distinguished between two
(intended or unintended) or three (intended, mistimed, or unwanted) categories of intention
status. Yet these categories may be too broad; newer research has found significant
differences in the maternal characteristics of pregnancies that were mistimed by less than
two years and pregnancies mistimed by two or more years [14-16]. These distinctions in the
timing of pregnancy may be related to women’s willingness or ability to engage in health-
promoting behaviors.
This paper uses linked longitudinal data from the 2004-2008 Oklahoma Pregnancy Risk
Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) and The Oklahoma Toddler Survey (TOTS) from
2006-2010 to examine the association between pregnancy intentions and health in the
prenatal and postnatal periods and early childhood. These data are integral parts of the MCH
monitoring system in Oklahoma [17, 18]. We employ propensity score analysis and an
expanded measure of pregnancy intentions to disentangle childbearing intentions from
maternal background characteristics and assess the impact of unintended childbearing on
health behaviors and outcomes during pregnancy, infancy and early childhood.
Methods
Data and Study Population
We examined survey data for 2004-2008 collected in the annual Oklahoma PRAMS, a
random sample of postpartum women who delivered live births in Oklahoma, and data
linked from a follow-back survey sent to PRAMS respondents when their child was two
years old (TOTS 2006-2010).* The PRAMS and TOTS are mixed-mode surveillance
systems; in each, two mail surveys are sent, followed by telephone surveillance for

nonrespondents; all cases are linked to the formal birth certificate as well. Both surveys were
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Oklahoma State Department of Health;
detailed methodology is documented elsewhere [19, 20]. No additional IRB approval was
required as our study involves only secondary data analysis.
From 2004 to 2008, 9,829 mothers completed the PRAMS questionnaire within 2-6 months
of the birth of their infant; 6,648 of these mothers (68%) completed the TOTS survey when
their child was two years old. We found no significant differences in the distributions of
intention status or socio demo graphic measures between PRAMS and TOTS respondents.
Measures
Pregnancy intentions—All state-level PRAMS surveys include a question on pregnancy
intentions that allows for the construction of a three-category measure: intended, mistimed
or unwanted. Pregnancy intention is based on women’s self-reports of their desire to become
pregnant right before the conception occurred. The survey asked all women, “Thinking back
to just before you got pregnant with your new baby, how did you feel about becoming
pregnant?” possible response categories were “I wanted to be pregnant sooner, I wanted to
be pregnant later, I wanted to be pregnant then, I didn’t want to be pregnant then or at any
time in the future.” The Oklahoma PRAMS added a follow-up question for women reporting
they wanted to be pregnant later; “How much later did you want to become pregnant?”†,‡
We combined responses to these two questions into a four-category measure of intention
status: intended, mistimed by less than two years, mistimed by two or more years (referred
to as seriously mistimed), and unwanted. The retrospective reporting period for pregnancy
intentions is only 2–6 months after delivery, likely improving accurate reporting in contrast
to surveys with retrospective recall periods extending years after the pregnancy, such as the
National Survey of Family Growth [15].
Outcome measures—Based on the measures available in the two surveys, we
constructed dichotomous measures of key indicators of health behaviors and outcomes
during the prenatal, infancy and early childhood periods [2, 21, 22].
Maternal prenatal behavior:
• Mother recognized she was pregnant within the first eight weeks of the pregnancy
• Prenatal care was initiated in the first trimester§
• Mother smoked in last trimester
• Other exposure to cigarette smoke during the pregnancy
*Oklahoma is one of only four states with data avaible from follow-up interviews of PRAMS mothers; the others are Alaska, Rhode
Island, and Oregon.
†Only one other state (Utah) included such a question in the PRAMS survey during the same period.
‡Response categories were less than 1 year, 1 year to less than 2 years, 2 years to less than 3 years, 3 years to less than 4 years, 4 years
or more.
§Mothers slightly overestimate early entry into prenatal care on the PRAMS survey (Oklahoma State Department of Health,
PRAMSGRAM Initiation of Prenatal Care Among Women Having a Live Birth in Oklahoma, 1995, 5(2) http://www.ok.gov/health2/
documents/PRAMSInitiation%20of%20PNC95.pdf.pdf, accessed 11/21/13); however, these small overestimates are unlikely to affect
our final estimates substantially.

Infant health at birth:
• Preterm delivery (at or before 36 weeks of pregnancy
• Low birth weight (LBW) (less than 2500 grams)**
Maternal postnatal behavior:
• Initiated breastfeeding
• Baby was breastfed at least six months (with or without formula supplemention)
Early childhood measures:
• Child had four days or more of limited activity due to health in the past three
months
• Child had an illness†† in the last 30 days
• Child was injured seriously enough in the past year to require medical treatment or
advice
• Child was currently exposed at least an hour per day to cigarette smoke
The early childhood measures and breastfeeding at six months are measured in TOTS; all
other measures are from PRAMS.
Statistical Analysis
We excluded 294 births from PRAMS and 75 births from TOTS because of missing data on
intention status; more births were excluded due to missing values on key covariates,
resulting in an analytical sample of 8,446 births in PRAMS and 5,808 births in TOTS.
Sample sizes vary slightly across outcomes due to small numbers of missing cases. We first
examine bivariate associations between pregnancy intentions and health behaviors and
outcomes. We then investigate the extent to which births differ in their background
characteristics across the four intention status groups. Finally, we use propensity score
methods to examine the effect of pregnancy intentions on health behaviors and outcomes
after accounting for variation in background characteristics.
Propensity score methods are increasingly being used with observational data to disentangle
confounding and causal factors. These methods account for differences between treatment
and control groups that affect both group assignment and the outcome under study by
modeling the selection process into each group [23, 24], Although matching is most
commonly used for propensity analyses, this approach is most appropriate for dichotomous
treatment conditions (a single treatment versus a single control) [25].
Since our “treatment”–intention status–has four categories, we used an alternate approach of
inverse probability weighting (IPW) [26, 27]. We estimated a multinomial logistic
regression model with intention status as the dependent variable (intended births were the
reference category), which was then used to calculate predicted propensity scores. We

included any available covariates in the model known to be predictors of both pregnancy
intentions and our other dependent measures [28]. Prior research suggested three sets of
confounding measures in the survey: life course status (including maternal age, union status
at conception, parity), socioeconomics (including household poverty level, race/ethnicity,
education), and access to health care and orientation towards health promotion (including
health insurance, maternal alcohol and cigarette use prior to pregnancy). We assessed the
adequacy of the propensity score estimation process by comparing the distribution of
covariates across the intention status groups before and after the inverse propensity score
weighting using the Pearson χ2 test. When no significant differences remained, we
considered the intention status groups “balanced” with respect to the background
characteristics of the mothers. This process was iterative as we developed a multinomial
logistic regression model that increased balance; covariates were included regardless of
statistical significance. The process was conducted separately for the PRAMS and the TOTS
samples.
Finally, we tested for a relationship between intention status and each of the outcome
measures using logistic regression with each observation weighted by the inverse of its
propensity score. For the outcomes measured at age two, we also estimated multivariate
models with controls for potential mediating factors that occurred temporally between the
pregnancy–when intention status was determined–and age two that might directly influence
the outcomes; available measures included infant in ICU following birth, LBW, preterm,
union status at birth (married, cohabiting, other), and household poverty level at time of
TOTS interview; in preliminary analyses, each of these measures had a significant bivariate
association with one or more of the toddler outcomes at p<.05.
We performed the analyses using svy commands in STATA 13.0 to account for the complex
sampling designs of the surveys. All analyses were performed using data weighted by the
population weights provided in the data. When using propensity weights, we multiplied each
observation’s inverse propensity weight by the population weight in order to obtain unbiased
effects based on the population of all births [29]. We excluded two cases from the PRAMS
sample and three cases from the TOTS sample where the propensity values were extreme
outliers.
Results
Association of intention status and health outcomes before balancing
Table 1 presents the estimated proportion of births experiencing each outcome, by intention
status of the birth, for the unbalanced data. At baseline, 51% of births were reported as
intended, 16% as mistimed by less than two years, 22% as mistimed by two or more years,
and 11% as unwanted. Overall, high proportions of women recognized their pregnancy
within eight weeks (88%) and received prenatal care during the first trimester (86%).
Twenty percent of women reported smoking during the last trimester and 40% reported
other exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy. Seven percent of infants were classified
as LBW and 12% as preterm. About three-quarters of infants had mothers who initiated
breastfeeding; among this group, 56% were breastfed for at least six months. At age two,

recent illness was common (58%), while rates of limited activity (13%), recent injury (13%)
or exposure to cigarette smoke (15%) were substantially lower.
In the unbalanced data, most outcomes varied significantly by intention status. Mothers of
intended births were significantly more likely to engage in health promoting prenatal
behaviors and to breastfeed than mothers of births in the unintended groups. Unwanted
births were slightly but significantly more likely to be LBW as compared to intended births
(8% versus 7%). The proportion preterm did not vary significantly by intention status.
Toddlers whose birth had been mistimed–whether by less than two years or by two or more
years–were significantly less likely than toddlers whose birth had been intended to have
been breastfed to at least six months of age; they were also significantly more likely to be
exposed to cigarette smoke and to have had a recent illness. For toddlers whose birth was
seriously mistimed, a significantly greater proportion had their activity limited due to health-
related issues than did toddlers from intended births (16% vs. 12%). Toddlers from intended
and unwanted births did not differ significantly on any measure except for higher rates of
exposure to cigarette smoke among the latter (11% vs. 17%). Injury and intention status
were not associated in the unbalanced sample.
Association of intention status and covariates
In the unbalanced data, intention status in the PRAMS sample varied significantly on life
course, socioeconomic and health orientation measures (Table 2). Statistically significant
differences in the distribution of characteristics across intention status groups are indicated
by the p-value of the overall chi-square test. Intended births were more likely to occur to
older or married women. Seriously mistimed births were most likely to be a first birth
(54%), while unwanted births were the least likely to be a first birth (21%). Intention status
groups also varied significantly by race/ethnicity, education, and household poverty status.
Additionally, births whose mothers were on Medicaid at the time they became pregnant
were least likely to be found among intended births (6%), and most likely among seriously
mistimed births (17%). Finally, mistimed and unwanted births had mothers with higher
levels of drinking and smoking prior to the pregnancy than did intended births.
Compared with births mistimed by less than two years, births that were seriously mistimed
were more likely to have teen mothers, to be conceived outside of marriage, to be first
births, to be living in a household below the poverty line and to have mothers with low
education.‡‡ Also of note are differences in the characteristics of seriously mistimed births
and unwanted births; the latter are less likely to be a first birth and more likely to have older
or married mothers.
Key to this analysis, after weighting the observations by the inverse of the propensity scores
derived from multinomial regression, distributions of the characteristics of births in the
intention status groups were balanced on all of the variables examined (p>.05; final column,
‡‡Paired comparisons of differences in the size of the proportions for intention status groups for individual attributes were tested for
statistical significance using t-tests. Only statistically significant differences are mentioned in the text (p<.05).

Table 2). The covariates were also balanced as assessed by the standardized bias approach
(results not shown) [25].
Association of intention status and outcomes, after weighting by propensity scores
Table 3 presents results of bivariate logistic regressions estimating the association between
intention status and the prenatal and postnatal measures, weighting the data by the inverse
propensity scores to balance the sample on background characteristics. Women with
seriously mistimed births (OR =.58) or unwanted births (OR=.33) had significantly lower
odds than women with an intended birth of recognizing the pregnancy early; they were also
about half as likely as women with intended births to obtain early prenatal care, and had
significantly higher likelihoods of exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy. Maternal
smoking was not associated with intention status.
After balancing, we found no significant differences across the intention status groups in
either the likelihood of LBW or preterm births. Compared to women with intended births,
only women with an unwanted birth were significantly less likely to initiate breastfeeding
(OR=.68).
After balancing the data, few significant differences by intention status in the early
childhood measures remain (Table 4) in models without (Model 1) or with controls for
potential mediating variables (Model 2). In both models, among women who initiated
breastfeeding, continuing for at least six months was significantly less likely among women
with births mistimed by less than two years than women with intended births. Additionally,
a toddler was significantly more likely to have an activity limitation (OR=1.57) if the birth
was seriously mistimed as compared to intended, but only after controlling for mediating
variables. Intention status was not significantly associated with exposure to cigarette smoke,
recent illness, or recent injury in either set of models.
Discussion
Unintended childbearing is very common in Oklahoma, accounting for nearly half of all live
births, as compared with 39% nationally [30]. Our analysis offers four central findings. First,
echoing recent studies, we found substantial demographic and socioeconomic differentials in
unintended childbearing [10, 15, 31]. Second, we found that while intention status was
significantly associated at the bivariate level with many health behaviors and outcomes,
these relationships were weakened when background characteristics were adjusted through
propensity score analysis. Even so, a number of significant associations remained in the
balanced models, such that intended births were associated with better health behaviors and
outcomes. Third, most of the negative associations between mistimed childbearing and the
health outcomes were concentrated among women with seriously mistimed or unwanted
births. (Breastfeeding for at least six months is the one exception, as this health behavior
was significantly less likely for women with births mistimed by less than two years.)
Finally, we found that the associations of intention status with health behaviors and
outcomes were most evident in the prenatal period, limited in the post-natal period, and
mostly insignificant by age two.

Oklahoma was one of the first states to incorporate the extent of mistiming in the PRAMS
survey, allowing us to identify four categories of pregnancy intentions. As of 2012, revised
PRAMS surveys for all participating states include the additional question on extent of
mistiming. Our findings highlight the value of this effort; distinguishing among mistimed
births delineates important differentiation in many of the associations with the health
behaviors and outcomes under study. Intended, mistimed <2 years, mistimed more than 2
years and unwanted likely reflect different aspects of fertility preferences related to the
starting, spacing and stopping of childbearing [32], The health consequences of unintended
childbearing appear concentrated among seriously mistimed and unwanted births. Long-
acting reversible contraceptives, such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants, seem
particularly well-suited to reducing seriously mistimed births [33, 34], and access needs to
be facilitated, especially for low-income women [35].
This analysis took advantage of unique data to examine the effect of pregnancy intentions at
three distinct points in time–the prenatal period, the immediate postpartum period, and the
early childhood period. Estimated effects were strongest in the prenatal period, and
diminished by age two, suggesting that over time mothers adjust to unintended births and are
responsive to the health needs of their young child regardless of intention status. In the
prenatal period, women with seriously mistimed and unwanted pregnancies were less likely
to engage in health-promoting behaviors than women with intended pregnancies. These
early effects are important, as behaviors during the prenatal period can be the foundation for
later health and well-being over the life course [36].
A number of prenatal and infant measures were not associated with intention status in the
balanced model. While maternal smoking prior to pregnancy was strongly associated with
intention status in the unbalanced results, in the balanced data this association disappeared,
indicating that socio demo graphic factors, not pregnancy intention, are the main drivers of
smoking behavior. The weak associations in even the unbalanced data between intention
status and infant health outcomes (preterm, LBW,) stand in contrast to a recent meta-
analysis finding consistent evidence of a bivariate relationship between intention status and
these outcomes [37]. However, most studies able to control for background characteristics
have found little evidence of a relationship between mistimed or unwanted births and these
outcomes [38-41].
Although intended births had significantly better health outcomes at age two in the bivariate
measures, these differences were almost entirely explained by confounding factors, adjusted
in the propensity models. Other recent research in early childhood, focused on
developmental and cognitive outcomes, also finds the effects of intention status greatly
diminished after controlling for background characteristics of mothers [8, 41]. Although
women appear to accommodate an unintended birth over time, so that by two years the
health and well-being of children is equalized across intention statuses, background
inequalities at the time of pregnancy have longer-term influences on the lives of young
children. Policies and programs that help women achieve their desired fertility levels and
timing would likely shift the socioeconomic distribution of childbearing and reduce
inequalities, as women postpone births until a time of greater economic and life course
stability.

Several limitations to this study should be noted. The data are retrospective, creating the
potential for recall bias [42, 43]; however, the retrospective recall period is shorter than in
many other surveys. Furthermore, as in any self-reports, responses are open to social
desirability, whether underreporting of negative health behaviors or overreporting of
positive behaviors; all of the outcome measures other than low birth weight are self-
reported. Additionally, the available health measures in the survey at age two are limited,
and the findings might be different with additional measures. One example would be a
maternal rating of overall child health, which may be more robust than the health indicators
currently available in the TOTS [44], Additionally, measures of cognitive or other
developmental markers might be used to assess if intention status influences how mothers
interact with their child and any subsequent consequences. Overall, further research is
needed to identify specific pathways between pregnancy intentions, maternal behaviors, and
child outcomes.
We hypothesize that some of the weak relationships observed in this study reflect the
relatively severe economic challenges among childbearing women in Oklahoma. For
example, 37% of births in the Oklahoma PRAMS were to women living below the federal
poverty line, a level far higher than the national average (27%) [15]. And in 2008, 61% of
births in Oklahoma were publicly funded (through programs such as Medicaid and the
Indian Health Service), compared to 48% of US births overall [30]. Indeed, available
sociodemographic measures are likely only part of an otherwise unmeasured constellation of
economic and life course constraints. Substantial challenges of motherhood may exist for
many of these women, regardless of their pregnancy intentions. Ethnographic research
highlights the less salient influence of intention status as compared to other constraints for
women in contexts in which unintended childbearing is common [45]. This phenomenon
may be reflected in our findings such that the effects of intention status have less of an
impact than the socioeconomic context of a birth.

Other factors also varied significantly by intention status and were therefore included in the multivariate regression used to calculate propensity
scores: abuse by partner in 12 months prior to birth (yes/no), Spanish questionnaire (yes/no), all sources of income, stressful life events in year
before birth, number of dependents in household, visited dentist in past year (yes/no), dieting in order to lose weight 3 months prior to pregnancy
(yes/no), heard or read about benefits of folic acid (yes/no), and tested for HIV (yes/no). Interaction terms between several of the above variables,
as well as for the year of survey administration, were also included in the propensity model but are not listed here due to space constraints.
