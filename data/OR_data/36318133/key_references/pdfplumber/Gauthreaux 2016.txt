Abstract
Postpartumdepression(PPD)isaformofmajordepressivedisorderaffectingapproximately13%ofwomenworldwide.Unintended
pregnancies, reaching close to50% of the pregnancies in the United States, have become a majorhealth concern. While many
physiologic and psychosocial causes have been analyzed, few studies have examined the relationship between unintended
pregnancyandsymptoms of PPD.
