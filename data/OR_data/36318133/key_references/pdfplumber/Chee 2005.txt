Abstract
Background: Toinvestigatetheprevalence,socio-culturalandpsychosocialriskfactorsforperinataldepressioninSingaporean
women.
Method: Aprospectivecohortof559womenwasinterviewedantenatallyandatsixweeks’postpartumatatertiaryhospital.
Womenwereinterviewedfordiagnosisofdepressionusingatwo-stagedesign,withascreeningquestionnaireanddiagnostic
interview.
Results: Postnatally, a negative confinement experience was associated with depression. Other independent factors included
pooremotionalsupport,apasthistoryofdepression,unplannedpregnancyandperceivedpotentialconflictswithrelativesover
childcare antenatally and dissatisfaction, poor instrumental support postnatally. The prevalence of depression antenatally and
postnatally was12.2% and6.8%,respectively.
Limitations: Measuresofsatisfactionwithsocialsupportwerebasedonself-report;therewerehighdropoutratesatsixweeks’
postpartum; andothermodulating social factors suchas pre-existinginterpersonal conflictswere not studied.
Conclusions: Perinatal depression in Singaporean women is common. Contrary to expectations, a negative dconfinementT
experience is a significant risk factor for postnatal depression, and is not universally welcomed by women. Depression is
modulated bydissimilar setsof psychosocial factors antenatally andpostnatally.
