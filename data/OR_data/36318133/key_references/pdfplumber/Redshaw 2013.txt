From Antenatal to Postnatal Depression:
Associated Factors and Mitigating Influences
Maggie Redshaw, BA, PhD, C Psychol and Jane Henderson, BSc, MSc, RM
Abstract
Introduction: Postnatal depression has a serious impact on new mothers and their children and families. Risk
factors identified include a history of depression, multiparity, and young age. The study aimed to investigate
factors associated with experiencing antenatal depression and developing subsequent postnatal depression.
Methods: The study utilized survey data from 5332 women about their experience and well-being during
pregnancy,inlabor,andpostnatallyupto3months.Prespecifiedsociodemographicandclinicalvariableswere
tabulatedagainsttheincidenceofantenataldepressionandpostnataldepression.Binarylogisticregressionwas
used to estimate the effects of the principal underlying variables.
Results:Riskfactorsforantenataldepressionweremultiparity,blackandminorityethnic(BME)status,physical
or mental health problems, living in a deprived area, and unplanned pregnancy. Different factors for postnatal
depressionwereevidentamongwomenwhohadexperiencedantenataldepression:multiparityandBMEstatus
were protective, whereas being left alone in labor and experiencing poor postnatal health increased the risk of
postnatal depression.
Conclusion: This study confirms previous research on risk factors for antenatal depression and stresses the
importanceofcontinuoussupportinlaborandvigilanceinthepostnatalperiodregardingthepotentialilleffects
of continuing postnatal health problems.
