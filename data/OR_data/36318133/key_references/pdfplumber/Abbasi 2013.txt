Abstract
Background: Postpartum depression is a mental disorder that occurs after birth and has negative consequences
for the mother, infant, and family. The objective of this secondary analysis was to examine whether pregnancy
intention was associated with postpartum depression among first-time mothers.
Methods:TheFirstBabyStudyisaprospectivecohortstudyofwomenaged18–35havingafirstsingletonbirth
inPennsylvania.Baselinedatawerecollectedduringthethirdtrimester.Postpartumdepressivesymptomswere
measured at 1-month postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Logistic regression was
performed to examine the association between unintended pregnancy and postpartum depression, controlling
for prepregnancy anxiety/depression and sociodemographic data.
Results: Of 2972 first-time mothers, 83.4% were white, 70.7% were married, and 56.9% were college educated.
Nine hundred fifty-two women (32.0%) reported their pregnancy was unintended and 151 (5.1%) met the
threshold for postpartum depression. The prevalence of postpartum depression was higher in women with
unintendedpregnanciescomparedtowomenwithintendedpregnancies(6.7%vs.4.3%,p<0.01).However,after
controlling for confounders, unintended pregnancy was no longer associated with postpartum depression
(adjustedOR1.41;95%CI0.91–2.18).Variablesindependentlyassociatedwithpostpartumdepressionincluded
prepregnancy anxiety/depression, Asian race, and Hispanic ethnicity.
Conclusion: Pregnancy intention was not independently associated with postpartum depression among first
time mothers in Pennsylvania.
