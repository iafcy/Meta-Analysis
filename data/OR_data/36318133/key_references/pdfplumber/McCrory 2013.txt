Abstract
Background: Unintended pregnancy is associated with increased risk for adverse neonatal and early childhood
outcomes spanning an array of indicators, but it remains unclear whether these risks hold independent of other
biological,socialandenvironmentalriskfactors.
Methods: This study uses data from the first wave of the ‘Growing Up in Ireland Study’, a large nationally repre-
sentative cohort study of more than 11000 infants, to examine the risk factors associated with unintended preg-
nancy.Adoptingastagedapproachtotheanalysis,thestudyinvestigateswhetherpregnancyintentioninfluences

intention carries any additional risk for adverse infant and maternal health outcomes when we adjust for back-
groundcharacteristicsandprenatalbehaviours.
Results: The study confirmed that sociodemographic factors are strongly associated with unintended pregnancy
and that unintended pregnancy is associated with a range of health compromising behaviours that are known to
be harmful to the developing fetus. While there was little evidence to suggest that pregnancy intention was
associated with adverse neonatal outcomes or developmental delay independent of other covariates, there was
strong evidence that intention status had a bearing on the mother’s psychosocial health. Unintended pregnancy
was associated with increased risk of depression (risk ratio 1.36 [95% confidence interval 1.19, 1.54]), and higher
parentingstress(riskratio1.27[95%confidenceinterval1.16,1.38]).
Conclusions: Ascertaining the mother’s pregnancy intention during the first antenatal visit may represent a means
formonitoringthoseatgreatestriskforadversemotherandchildoutcomes.
