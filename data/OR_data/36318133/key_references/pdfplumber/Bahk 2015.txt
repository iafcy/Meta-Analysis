Abstract
Background: Pregnancy intention is important for maternal and child health outcomes. The purpose of this study
was to examine thecausal relation between pregnancy intention and maternal depression and parentingstressin
Korean women who gave birth during 2008.
Methods: This study is a retrospectiveevaluationof prospectively collecteddata from the Panel Study on Korean
Childrenfrom2008to2010.Causalanalyseswereconductedusingpropensityscorematchingandinverseprobability
