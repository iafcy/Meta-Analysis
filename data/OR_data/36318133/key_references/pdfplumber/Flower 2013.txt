Pregnancy planning, smoking behaviour during
pregnancy, and neonatal outcome: UK
millennium cohort study

Abstract
Background: Pre-pregnancy health and care are important for thehealth ofthefuture generations. Smoking
during pregnancy has been well-researchedand there is clear evidence of harm. Butthere has been littleresearch
onthe health impact ofplanning for pregnancy. This study aims to investigate theindependent effectsof
pregnancy planning and smoking during pregnancy onneonataloutcome.
Methods: This analysis made use of data from theUK Millennium Cohort Study. The study sample consisted of
18,178 singleton babies born in UK between 2000 and 2001.The neonatal outcomes of interest were low
birthweight (<2.5 Kg) and pre-termbirth (<37 completedweeks gestation).Logistic regressionwas used to estimate
theassociation between pregnancy planning and/or smoking and neonatal outcome. Adjusted odds ratios were
used to calculate population attributable risk fractions (PAFs).
Results: 43% ofmothersdid not plan their pregnancy and 34% were smoking justbefore and/or during
pregnancy. Planners were half as likely to be smokers justbefore pregnancy, and more likelyto give up or reduce
theamount smoked if smokers. Unplanned pregnancieshad 24% increased odds of low birth weight and
prematurity compared to planned pregnancies(AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.48; AOR 1.24, 95%CI 1.05-1.45),

independent ofsmoking status. The odds of low birth weight for babies of mothers who were smoking just before
