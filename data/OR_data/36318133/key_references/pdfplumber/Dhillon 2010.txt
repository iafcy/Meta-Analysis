Abstract
Objective: to identify the prevalence of antenatal depression among Asian women living in the UKin one antenatal
clinic, andtoinvestigate the possible association withadesire foramale child andotherrisk factors.
Design: cross-sectional questionnaire-based study.
Setting: general antenatal clinic inahospital in Birmingham.
Participants: 300 Asian women, irrespectiveof placeof birth.
Methods: consecutiveAsianwomenattendingroutineantenatalappointmentsduringthestudyperiodself-completed
a questionnaire. The first part investigated socio-demographic, cultural and other possible risk factors, including
gender preference. Thesecond part comprisedthe Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).
Measurements: EPDSscore greater than orequal to12 indicating probable depression.
Findings: theprevalenceofdepressionwas30.7%(92/300,95%confidenceinterval25.4–35.9%).Maternalmalegender
preference was not common and was not associated with antenatal depression. Family male gender preference,
unplannedpregnancy,ahistoryofdepressionandfeelinganxiousinpregnancywereindependentlyassociatedwithan
increased likelihood of depression, whilst support from family and friends, being satisfied with pregnancy and being
multiparous wereassociated with areduced likelihoodofdepression.
Conclusion: ratesofantenataldepressionwereveryhighinAsianwomenwithsomeassociatedriskfactors.However,
male gender preference was not associated withantenatal depression.
Implicationsforpractice: giventhehighprevalence,screeningAsianwomenfordepressionmaybeindicatedtoallow
