Objective: Data are scarce regarding the sociodemographic predictors of antenatal and postpartum
depression. This study investigated whether race/ethnicity, age, finances, and partnership status were
associatedwithantenatalandpostpartumdepressivesymptoms.
Setting:1662participantsinProjectViva,aUScohortstudy.
Design: Mothers indicated mid-pregnancy and six month postpartum depressive symptoms on the
Edinburgh postpartum depression scale (EPDS). Associations of sociodemographic factors with odds of
