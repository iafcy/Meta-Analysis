Do Pregnancy Intentions Matter? A Research Note
Revisiting Relationships Among Pregnancy, Birth,

ABSTRACT The prev ent ion of unplanned or unint ended pregn anc ies cont inu es to be a
corn ers tone of U.S. reprod uct ive health poli cy, but the evid ence that such pregn anc ies
cause adverse matern al and child outc omes is limi ted. In this research note, we exam­
ine these relat ions hips using recent large­scale data and inverse prop ens ity weights

to matern al exper ie nce duri ng pregn ancy, but not to infant outc omes at birth—both of
which are cons ist ent with prior research. In an addit ion to the lite ra t ure, we show that
pregn ancy timi ng is rele v ant for a numb er of matern al outc omes, such as the onset of
depress ion and intim ate partn er viol ence, changes in smoki ng behavi or, and receipt of
med­i­cal­care.­These­find­ings­sug­gest­that­pol­icy­intended­to­improve­infant­wel­fare­by­

improve out comes.
KEYWORDS Pregnancy intent ion • Maternal health • Infant outc omes • Health poli cy
Introduction
Preventing unint ended or unplanned pregn an cies has long been a corn er stone of U.S.
repro duc tive health poli cy, part ially because infant and matern al outc omes are bet ter
after a planned vers us an unplanned preg nancy (Brown and Eisenberg 1995; Gipson
et al. 2008; Institute of Medicine 2011). These well­established asso ci a tions helped
jus tify expanded cont ra cep tive insura nce cove r age in the 2010 Affordable Care Act
(Institute of Medicine 2011).
Despite­its­import­ant­influ­ence­in­poli­cy­maki­ng,­pregn­ancy­intent­ion—its­rela­
tion ship to outc omes, mea sure ment, and con cep tual value—has long been the sub­
ject of debate (Aiken et al. 2016; Kost and Lindberg 2015; Kost and Zolna 2019;
Luker 1999; Potter et al. 2019; Trussell et al. 1999). Unintended preg nan cies have
been assoc i ated with nega tive fami ly and child outc omes, even after cont rol ling for
matern al char ac ter is tics within a mul ti ple regres sion framew ork (Cheng et al. 2009;

Joyce et al. 2000; Kost et al. 1998; Weller et al. 1987).1 However, other stud ies have
found almost no causal relat ion ship between pregn ancy intent ions and pregn ancy or
infant out comes at birth (Joyce et al. 2000; Kost and Lindberg 2015). We make two
con tri bu tions to this debate.
First, we revisit the ques tion of whether infants fare bett er when the preg nancy
was well­timed using a larger sam ple and with more pre cise meas ures and meth ods
than prior work. We aim to determ ine whether the assoc i a tion between pregn ancy
timi ng (for pregn an cies taken to term) and adverse outc omes is due solely to mater­
nal chara c ter is tics that are corr e lated with pregn ancy timi ng or whether pregn ancy
timi ng inde pen dently exerts a causal effect on outc omes. It is worth not ing here,
although we cons ider it more in the foll ow ing, that we use the trad i tional sur vey ques­
tion about whether the pregn ancy occurred when the woman wanted it to. Typically,
this­ques­tion­has­been­used­to­meas­ure­intent­ions.­In­light­of­sig­nifi­­cant­crit­iques­of­
this operationalization, we instead use the lang uage of timi ng.
Second, we expand the scope of outc omes to include a range of matern al pregn ancy
and postp art um outc omes. Much prior work addressed only infant outc omes at birth,
child outc omes, or matern al outc omes directly affecti ng the in utero envi ron ment, such
as matern al alcoh ol or tobacco cons umpt ion (Gipson et al. 2008). Research has found
links between pregn ancy intent ion and the exper ie nce of intim ate partn er viol ence
(IPV) (Jasinski 2001) and postp art um depress ion (Abajobir et al. 2016; Abbasi et al.
2013; Fellenzer and Cibula 2014; Mercier et al. 2013; but see Christensen et al. 2011),
as well as sympt oms of anxi e ty and stress later in life (Biggs et al. 2017; Herd et al.
2016), suggesting that matern al outc omes may be related to pregn ancy intent ions.
Data
We anal yze data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), an
annual surv ey admini st ered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state
health­depart­ments­of­a­strat­i­fied­sam­ple­of­indi­vid­u­als­who­have­recently­given­birth;­
respond ents are contacted within 2–4 months of the live birth. Survey data are integ rated
with­birth­cer­tifi­­cate­data,­which­are­the­source­of­many­crit­i­cal­infant­out­comes­at­birth,­
such as birth weight and pret erm birth. We use Phase 7 data from 2012–2015, repr es en­
tat ive of births in part icip ati ng states and 83% of births in the United States.
The PRAMS quest ionn aire employs the trad it ional quest ion to meas ure pregn ancy
intent ion: “Thinking back to just before you got pregn ant with your new baby, how did
you­feel­about­becom­ing­preg­nant?”­Respondents­choose­one­of­five­response­options:­
“I wanted to be pregn ant later,” “I wanted to be pregn ant sooner,” “I wanted to be
pregn ant then,” “I didn’t want to be pregn ant then or at any time in the future,” and “I
wasn’t sure what I wanted.” If mothe rs reported that they wanted to be pregn ant later,
the extent of mistiming was assessed with this foll ow­up quest ion: “How much long er
did you want to wait to become pregn ant?” Response options were “less than 1 year,”
1 People of all gen ders give birth. In the United States, most extant data sets include chara c ter iza tion
by gen der but assume that it corr e sponds to sex assigned at birth, and thus it is unclear whether men (or
other gend ers) with a uterus prov ided inform a tion about births. For pars i mony, we use female nouns and
pro nouns.

Do Pregnancy Intentions Matter? 39
“1 year to less than 2 years,” “2 years to less than 3 years,” “3 years to 5 years,” and
“more than 5 years.” We divide these responses into two groups: whether pregn anc ies
were earl ier than wanted by less than two years and whether they were earl ier than
wanted by two years or more. In Phase 7, PRAMS had added a new response option—“I
wasn’t sure what I wanted.” Comparisons between Phases 7 and 6 indic ate that respon­
dents who selected this option were drawn from all of the other options except “I wanted
to be pregn ant then,” suggesting that this choice is dist inct from the other three choices
(Maddow­Zimet and Kost 2020);­there­fore,­we­include­“unsure”­as­a­fifth­inten­tion­
cate g ory. Our results are thus not strictly comp ar ab le to anal ys es employing a four­
cate g ory meas ure of pregn ancy intent ions, but they may have greater conc ept ual validity.
We, like othe rs, quest ion the interp ret at ion of this quest ion as capt uri ng “intent ions”
(Kost and Zolna 2019; Potter et al. 2019; Santelli et al. 2003). This conc ern is borne
out of both con cep tual and mea sure ment issues. The con se quences are con sid er able:
unint ended births can be cons trued as an inabili ty or unwilli ngn ess to plan, a viol a­
tion of Ameri c ans’ notion of a respons ib le adult (Shim 2010). Therefore, rather than
using the trad it ional lang uage of “intended” and “unint ended,” we hew more closely to
the data in describi ng pregn anc ies as “then/sooner,” “wanted <2 years later,” “wanted
≥2 years later,” “never/unwanted,” and “unsure.” We also share conc erns that pare nts
revise pregn ancy timi ng prefe re nces over the course of the pregn ancy and in light of
infant well­being, leav ing a ret ro spec tive self­report vul ner a ble to mea sure ment error.
While typi c ally reports shift from unint ended to intended, some studi es have shown the
reverse (Guzzo and Hayford 2014; Joyce et al. 2002; Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1993;
Westoff and Ryder 1977). Revision is part icu l arly likely when the infant exper ie nces
adverse health events, which is discussed in more detail in the foll owi ng.
All depen dent var i ables and sam ple sizes are listed in Table 1.2 Each out come is
binary (yes/no). Pregnancy outc omes include when the mother reco g nized her preg­
nancy­and­whether­she­received­pren­at­al­care­within­the­first­trim­ est­er,­gained­the­
recommended­weight­dur­ing­pregn­ancy­as­defined­by­the­Ameri­c­an­College­of­Obste­
tricians and Gynecologists (2013), engaged in smoki ng or drinki ng dur ing preg nancy,
or exper i enced the onset of IPV duri ng pregn ancy. Infant outc omes at birth include
whether the birth was pret erm and whether the newb orn was low (<2,500 g) or very
low (<1,500 g) birth weight, was small for gest a tional age, was admitt ed to the inten­
sive care unit (ICU), or died before age 1. Maternal postp ar tum outc omes include
moth ers’ reports of ever breastfeeding or breastfeeding for at least three months,
attendi ng a post par tum medi cal visit, and changes in depress ion or smok ing.
PRAMS data are coll ected from birthing pare nts who recently had a live birth and
exclude those whose pregn an cies ended in misc ar riage, abort ion, or stillb irth. We
can not assess whether matern al well­being duri ng and after these pregn an cies var­
ied by pregn ancy timi ng for those excluded popu la tions. Because access to abort ion
dif fers by state of resi dence and econ omic and social privi lege, select ion into unin­
tended birth is non ran dom. Our data are cond i tional on this select ion pro cess. Our
ana ly ses comp are moth ers who reported that their preg nan cies were well­timed with
oth er wise simi lar mothe rs who reported that their pregn an cies were mistimed, but we
can not say whether these same mothe rs would have taken their pregn an cies to term if
abor tion had been more readi ly avail a ble.

Results
As expected, mothe rs who wanted their pregn an cies then, sooner, or later but within
two years were advant aged com pared with mothe rs in the three other groups (Table
2): they had more years of edu ca tion, were more likely to be marr ied, and were less
likely to have had their pren a tal care paid by Med ic aid. Table 2 also shows that
they were more likely to exper i ence adverse preg nancy, birth, and post par tum out­
comes. Disentangling these corr e la tions requires adjusting for dif fer ences in moth ers’
char ac ter is tics.

Despite these dif fer ences in matern al expe ri ence dur ing preg nancy by preg nancy
timi ng, infants’ health at birth was quite simi lar after pro pen sity weighting (Figure 2).

pre ci sion of the estim ate suggest that unwanted births are at least as likely to result
in infant mort al ity than wanted births. In sum, pregn ancy timi ng may have affected
matern al expe ri ence dur ing preg nancy, but did not meas ur ably impact infant health
in utero.
Results for matern al postp ar tum outc omes are shown in Figure 3. Women whose
preg nan cies were unwanted or arrived more than two years earl ier than wanted and
those who were unsure how they felt about their pregn ancy fared unamb ig u ously
worse than women whose pregn an cies were bett er timed, even after weighting.
Among women who were depressed prior to preg nancy, those with unwanted births,
those who were unsure how they felt about their preg nancy, and those whose preg­
nan cies occurred more than two years before they wanted to be pregn ant were less
likely than the refe r ence group to expe ri ence relief from their depress ion. Women in
these three categories who did not report depres sion prior to preg nancy were more
likely to become depressed after givi ng birth. They were less likely to report havi ng
reduced or quit smok ing and were equally likely to report hav ing increased smok ing.
Further, women whose pregn an cies were unwanted or who were unsure how they felt
about their pregn ancy were less likely to attend a postp ar tum checkup.

Do Pregnancy Intentions Matter? 45
Fig. 2 Unadjusted and inverse propensity­weighted estimates of associations between pregnancy inten­
tions and infant outcomes at birth, giving odds ratios relative to pregnancies that were wanted then or
sooner. Scales on the x­axes vary. Models include all respondents. Data are from Phase 7 of the National
PRAMS. See the online Appendix Section 1 for details on estimation of the propensity­weighted model.
Odds ratios and standard errors are given in Appendix Section 3, Table 2. ICU = intensive care unit.
Women whose pregn an cies were earl ier than they wanted were as likely as other
moth ers to have ever breastfed or to have breastfed for at least three months. Those
whose preg nan cies were unwanted or who were unsure about their preg nancy were
less likely to have ever breastfed or to have breastfed for at least three months. These
results­comp­lem­ ent­find­ings­from­Kost­and­Lindberg­(2015), who found simi lar rela­
tion ships only for preg nan cies that were unwanted. Our results reveal that mean ing ful
rela tion ships with breastfeeding extend beyond pregn an cies that were unwanted to
those about which the mother felt unsure.
In sum, after account ing for poten tial con found ers, preg nancy tim ing was not
asso ci ated with infant out comes at birth, but women whose preg nan cies arrived
sooner than they wanted had worse post par tum out comes than those whose preg nan­
cies were on time or arrived later than they wanted. Women who had pregn an cies
that were unwanted or were marke dly earl ier than wanted, and women who were
unsure about their preg nancy, suf fered numero us del e te ri ous out comes and behav­
iors, includ ing IPV, depres sion, tobacco con sump tion, lack of early pre na tal care, and
lack of post par tum care.

Fig. 3 Unadjusted and inverse propensity­weighted estimates of associations between pregnancy inten­
tions and postpartum outcomes, giving odds ratios relative to pregnancies that were wanted then or sooner.
Scales on the x­axes vary. The postpartum visit and ever breastfed models include all respondents; the
depression initiated model includes respondents reporting no depression prior to pregnancy; the depression
improved model includes respondents reporting depression prior to pregnancy; the smoking worsened
model includes respondents reporting smoking <41 cigarettes/day three months before pregnancy; the
smoking improved model includes respondents reporting tobacco use three months before pregnancy; and
the breastfed for ≥3 months model includes respondents interviewed at least 91 days after birth. Data are
from Phase 7 of the National PRAMS. See the online Appendix Section 1 for details on estimation of the
propensity­weighted model. Odds ratios and standard errors are given in Appendix Section 3, Table 3.

Do Pregnancy Intentions Matter? 47
Discussion
One­jus­tifi­ ­cat­ion­for­pub­lic­poli­cy­encoura­gi­ng­planned­or­intended­pregn­anc­ies,­
how­ever­defined,­is­that­intended­pregn­anc­ies­are­bett­er­for­infants.­Like­prev­io­us­
researche­rs,­we­find­that­this­is­unsup­ported­by­the­data.­By­cont­rast,­our­results­
high light that preg nancy timi ng likely does matt er for matern al outc omes. We show
that women who wanted to be pregn ant later, did not want to be pregn ant at all, or
were unsure about the best tim ing for their preg nancy were at higher risk of inti mate
part ner vio lence and post par tum depres sion. Unwanted preg nan cies and preg nan cies
about which the mother was unsure were also assoc i ated with lower rates of breast­
feeding. These results are cons is tent with work show ing that mistimed pregn an cies
taken to term may have nega tive impacts on older child ren in the fami ly, in part ic­
u lar through changes in home envir on ments and par ents’ cogn i tive and emot ional
resources (Barber et al. 1999; Barber and East 2009, 2011). Given that the pregn ancy
timi ng ques tion was asked ret ro spec tively, it is pos si ble that these relat ion ships are
due to ex post revis ion in light of adverse events. Such revis ion is known to occur for
infant out comes (Smith­Greenaway and Sennott 2016), but more research is needed
to under stand their relat ion ships with matern al out comes.
To miti gate any nega tive effects of unwanted or mistimed pregn an cies on mater­
nal outc omes, reprod uc tive health poli cy should be recentered around reprod uc tive
auton omy and should include pol i cies such as uni ver sal access to no­cost con tra cep­
tion and abor tion, comp re hen sive sex educ a tion, and equity in reprod uc tive health
care, with part ic u lar attent ion to matern al risks. Women who express that a pregn ancy
was “unwanted” or “mistimed” are telli ng us that they would have pref erred not to
have become pregn ant at that time. Effective poli cy would work with, rather than
attempt­to­change,­these­prefe­re­nces.­■
