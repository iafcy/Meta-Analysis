Purpose—To determine which vision tests predict mortality within 10 years in a community- 
based elderly sample. 
Methods—Nine hundred residents of Marin County, CA, aged 58 to 101 (mean 75 years at 
baseline), underwent a battery of tests, including high contrast acuity, low contrast acuity, low 
contrast/low luminance acuity, acuity in glare, contrast sensitivity, color vision, stereopsis, 
standard and attentional fields. The association between the vision tests and mortality within 10 
years of baseline was assessed with Cox Proportional Hazards models controlling for age, sex, 
education level, depression, cognitive status and self-reported medical conditions. 
Results—Forty-three percent of the sample died within 10 years of baseline. When controlling 
for mortality-related covariates, impairment in any of the vision measures was associated with 
increased risk of death. However, non-standard vision measures (i.e. impairment in low 
contrast/low luminance acuity, standard field integrity and the impact of the attentional task on 
field integrity) were more highly associated with mortality than standard high contrast acuity. 
Conclusions—In agreement with other studies, we find that visual impairment is a significant 
predictor of death. However, the strongest relationship was found for measures other than high 
contrast acuity. These results suggest that non-standard vision measures may be more sensitive 
indicators of generalized aging in the oldest-old.

Many researchers have investigated the relationship between vision and mortality in aging 
individuals. Most report statistically significant increases in the risk of death with eye 
diseases1-17 (But see also18) and visual impairment.4,9,15,19-30 (But see also17) 
To our knowledge, of the studies that have assessed the relationship between visual 
impairment and mortality, only one has included a vision measure other than high contrast 
acuity. Pedula et.al. (2006) found that women with reductions in high contrast acuity or 
contrast sensitivity had a higher mortality rate than those with good vision on either 
measure.26 
Some authors have begun to question the strong reliance on standard acuity for vision 
assessment (for a review, see31). Clearly, high contrast acuity is the “gold standard” used by 
clinicians and researchers alike, but recent research suggests that it may not be the best 
predictor of everyday function, particularly when considering the rapidly growing elderly 
population.32-38 Studies have shown that, although elders maintain good high contrast acuity 
into old age, the same individuals can show a wide range of performance on non-standard 
vision tests.36,39,40 
The purpose of the current study is to confirm the previously reported association between 
visual impairment and mortality, but also to extend our understanding of this relationship by 
including vision measures other than standard high contrast acuity. Models were adjusted for 
age, sex, self-reported medical conditions, depression and cognitive status, since these 
variables are associated with mortality. (e.g. 41-44) 


Smith-Kettlewell Institute (SKI) Vision Study32,39 participants were a sub-sample of the 
Buck Center for Research in Aging's (BCRA) population-based study of health and 
functioning (H&F) of older adults in Marin County, CA. The BCRA Study has been 
described in detail previously.45 Briefly, the BCRA cohort (non-institutionalized residents of 
Marin County, CA, aged 55 and older) was identified through Health Care Financing 
Administration of Medicare-eligible residents (those 65 years and older) and through 
random digit dialing. Sixty-nine percent (N=2018) of those eligible agreed to participate in 
the baseline wave of the BCRA H&F Study (between 1989-91), and N=1521 participated in 
the follow-up BCRA H&F wave (1992-95). 
Potential subjects for the SKI Study Vision sample were identified from those who had 
participated in the BCRA H&F follow-up (N=1521). Of these, 92.8% were eligible and 
invited to participate in the SKI Vision Study (N=1410). This included all participants aged 
80 years and older, and a random sample of 88% of those younger than 80. Of the 1410 
subjects eligible to participate, 9% had died since completing the H&F follow-up, 27% 
refused, and <1% could not be located. Nine hundred elders (63.8%) participated in the SKI 
Study at baseline (11/92-12/95), and the remaining sample was tested at three subsequent 




follow-up (FU) waves of testing (i.e. FU1: 1/98-7/99, N=597; FU2: 1/00-3/02, N=452; FU3: 
2/05-12/06, N=254), and the final wave began in 7/08. 
This study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) for Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute and the 
California Pacific Medical Center. At each wave of testing, an explanation of all test 
procedures was given and each participant signed the IRB-approved consent form. 
Vision Measures—The SKI Study was intended to assess vision in a group of elderly 
individuals under everyday viewing conditions; all testing was completed binocularly with 
the participant's presenting (habitual) correction (glasses or contact lenses). 
The vision test battery used for the SKI Study has been described in detail elsewhere.39 The 
vision tests used for the current analysis are listed below. 


2. Low contrast/low luminance acuity was assessed with the dark chart of the Smith- 
Kettlewell Low Luminance (SKILL) Card48 at a 40 cm viewing distance. The 
SKILL Dark chart consists of black letters on a dark grey background. 


4. Contrast Sensitivity was assessed using the Pelli-Robson Chart50 at a 3 m viewing 
distance. The chart was scored letter by letter (each letter corresponds to 0.05 log 
unit).51 

depth perception that requires the two eyes to operate together, and is important for 
near tasks. The test consists of 3 plates of different thickness. At a viewing distance 
of 40 cm, the plates yield disparities of 340, 170, and 85 arcsec, with smaller 
numbers indicating better performance. 

requires that participants demonstrate color discrimination by placing colored caps 
in the appropriate order starting at a fixed color. The calculated Color Confusion 
Score indicates the severity of the color defect. A score of 0 indicates no 
arrangement errors (i.e. perfect performance).54 
7. Standard and attentional visual fields were measured with a modified Synemed 
perimeter.39 The test consisted of detection of bright, peripheral flashed targets 
without and with an added attentional task (silently counting central flashes). 
Standard field score was the percentage of locations missed (corrected for false- 
positive responses). The attentional field was scored as the percentage of locations 
missed (corrected for false positive responses AND the difference between actual 
and reported central attentional flashes). The difference between the attentional and 



standard field scores yielded a measure of the impact of attention on visual field 
integrity. This measure is somewhat similar to the useful field of view.55,56 
All acuity measures (1-3 above) were scored as number of letters read correctly and 
converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR). These acuities are 
also reported as a “Snellen equivalent” (e.g. 20/20). 
For each vision measure, two visual impairment “pass/fail” criteria were computed, and 
participants were coded as 0 (pass) or 1 (fail). These criteria were devised to define visual 
impairment for the non-standard acuity measures that are comparable to those of standard 
high contrast acuity. For high contrast acuity, Criterion 1 was “worse than 20/40” or >0.30 
logMAR, which is equivalent to 3 lines (0.30 log units) poorer than the “normal” visual 
acuity of 20/20 (0.0 logMAR). Criterion 2 was “worse than 20/70” or >0.54 logMAR, which 
is equivalent to 5.4 lines poorer than “normal” acuity. 
The first criterion (20/40) is the requirement for driver's licensure, and has been used by 
many previous mortality studies. 4,9,15,17 The second criterion (20/70) is used to qualify an 
individual legally as visually impaired and thus eligible for the associated services. Separate 
analyses were run using the two visual impairment criteria. 
A method similar to that used for high contrast acuity was employed to establish comparable 
criteria for the other vision measures used in this study. For each measure, a “normal” value 
was defined (i.e. a value expected in a young, healthy individual). For spatial vision 
measures (i.e. acuities and contrast sensitivity: 1-4 above), Criteria 1 and 2 were defined as 
0.30 and 0.54 log units worse than this young, normative value. Normal values were defined 
for stereopsis, color vision, standard field integrity and the impact of attentional task on 
visual field integrity, and cut-off values were selected. Table 1 presents the normal values 
and the two visual impairment cut-off criteria used for each vision variable. 
Other Covariates—Baseline age and years of education were included as continuous 
variables. The remaining covariates were coded as dichotomous variables. 
The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D)57,58 was used to assess 
the presence of depressive symptoms. The CES-D for each participant was categorized as 
‘not depressed’ (CES-D score <16) or ‘depressed’ (score of 16 or more). 
The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ)59 was used to indicate cognitive 
status. The SPMSQ was categorized as ‘no cognitive impairment’ (< 3 errors) or 
‘cognitively impaired’ (3 or more errors). 
Self-reported medical conditions were obtained by asking each participant “Have you been 
told by a doctor that you have….” (heart disease, hypertension, cancer, diabetes, stroke, 
arthritis). Each variable was categorized as ‘not reported’ or ‘reported’. 
Mortality Status—Date of death was obtained from the Social Security Death Index, local 
newspaper obituaries, or reports from relatives. Years from baseline to date of death was 



calculated for each participant, and those known to be alive for over 10 years after their 
baseline measure or missing were censored. 


Stata/SE 9.2 for Macintosh (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX) was used for all data 
analyses. To assess the difference between survivors and those who died, t-tests were used 
for continuous variables, and chi square tests were used for categorical measures. 
Initial univariate analyses to assess the risk of death within 10 years of baseline were 
conducted using Kaplan-Meier estimates, followed by multivariate Cox proportional hazards 
models adjusting for age, sex, and all possible covariates. Proportional hazards assumptions 
for the separate models were tested using Stata's linktest, as well as tests based on the 
Schoenfeld residuals.60 
Preliminary analyses also included all possible “age by variable” and “sex by variable” 
interaction terms. None was significant (p<0.10) and therefore interaction terms were 
therefore excluded from the final analyses. 
The mean age of the 900 participants at baseline was 75.5 years (SD=9.3, 
range=58.4-101.9), and 46.0% of the participants were male. As noted previously,38 this is a 
highly educated sample, with 73.4% reporting more than 12 years of education. Within 10 
years of the baseline test, 43.0% (N=387) of the participants had died. Mean time to death 
for these individuals was 5.18 years (SD=2.65, range=0.08-9.86). Table 2 presents the 
baseline characteristics for the total sample, those who were still alive, and those who died 
within 10 years of baseline. As expected from previous studies, those who died were more 
likely than the survivors to be older, male, less well-educated, cognitively impaired, and to 
self-report a history of several medical conditions. Participants who died within 10 years of 
baseline were not significantly more likely than survivors to be depressed, although there 
was a trend in this direction (p=0.07). 
Table 3 presents descriptive statistics for the vision variables separately for the survivors and 
for those who died. Means and standard deviations for each measure are presented, along 
with the percentage of participants who failed according to the two sets of visual impairment 
pass/fail criteria. Regardless of whether the data were analyzed as continuous measures (t- 
tests) or as dichotomous measures (chi squares), each vision measure was significantly 
worse in the group who died within 10 years of baseline when compared with survivors 
(P<0.0001). 
The results of Cox Proportional Hazards Models are presented in Table 4. This table present 
hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for each individual vision variable 
adjusted for covariates (age, sex, education level, cognitive impairment, depression, and 
each individual self-reported medical condition) for both visual impairment criteria. 
When using Visual Impairment Criterion 1 (Table 4: high contrast acuity worse than 20/40, 
reduced by >0.30 log units with comparable reductions from normal in other vision 



measures), all individual vision variables except high contrast acuity are significantly 
associated with mortality even when controlling for all other covariates. HRs range from 
1.30 (CI: 1.02-1.66) for low contrast acuity to 1.69 (CI:1.35-2.13) for standard visual field 
integrity. When Visual Impairment Criterion 2 is used (Table 4: high contrast acuity worse 
than 20/70, reduced by >0.54 log units with comparable reductions from normal in non- 
standard measures), all individual variables except color vision remain significant when 
other covariates are included. HRs range from 1.40 (CI: 1.11-1.78) for impact of attentional 
task on visual field integrity, to 1.94 (CI: 1.52-2.47) for standard visual field integrity. 
Since many of the vision variables under investigation are significantly correlated 
(particularly the spatial vision measures), including all simultaneously in regression models 
would cause their effects to cancel out. Therefore, stepwise Cox proportional hazards 
regression models were used to determine the vision variables with the strongest relationship 
to mortality while adjusting for all other covariates. Both backward and forward stepping 
models were run, and these yielded the same significant vision variables for both visual 
impairment criteria: Low contrast, low luminance acuity, standard visual field, and the 
impact of attentional task on visual fields. 
The final model including all covariates along with these three vision variables for the two 
Visual Impairment Criteria is presented in Table 5. HRs and CIs are provided for all 
variables. For Visual Impairment Criterion 1 (i.e. reduction in vision comparable to 20/40 
acuity), age, sex, self reported heart disease, low contrast/low luminance acuity, standard 
visual field and impact of attentional task on visual field are statistically significant. The 
same variables were also significant for Criterion 2 (i.e. reduction in vision comparable to 
20/70 acuity), along with self-reported history of stroke. 

Each of the vision measures assessed was associated with mortality at either visual 
impairment criterion. However, when controlling for age, sex and other mortality-related 
covariates, visual impairment defined as high contrast acuity poorer than 20/40 or 20/70 was 
not as strong a predictor as other vision measures with equivalent criteria as defined by 
reduction from young normal. In fact, for the 20/40 criterion commonly used, high contrast 
acuity was not a significant predictor of death when age is included in the model. 
These results are consistent with those reported by Knudtson et al (2006), that visual 
impairment was associated with reduced survival for the younger (<65) but not older (65-84) 
age groups15. Similarly, Kulmala et. al. (2008) found that visual acuity was associated with 
mortality in 75-year-old participants, but not 80-year olds28. The mean age of our sample at 
baseline was 75.5 years, with ages ranging from 58 to 103 years. It is likely that the older 
age of our participants could account for the weaker association between high contrast 
acuity and mortality. 
Most other studies evaluating the relationship between visual impairment and mortality used 
a visual impairment criterion of 20/40 best-corrected in better eye, 4,9,15,17 whereas our tests 
were all performed with habitual (presenting) correction under binocular viewing conditions. 



Since uncorrected refractive error is a common occurrence with older individuals,61-64 our 
20/40 cut-off likely included a number of participants who would have been classified as 
unimpaired with the proper spectacle correction. This could account for our lack of a 
significant association between high contrast acuity and mortality when controlling for other 
covariates (Table 4, Criterion 1). 
We do not regard this as weak point for our study, since it could be argued that testing vision 
under participants' normal everyday viewing conditions would be a more valid indication of 
their functional abilities,38 and some have recommended that the International Classification 
of Disease (ICD) criterion for defining visual impairment be changed to habitual 
(presenting) acuity.65, 66 
The findings of the current study are somewhat different from the results reported by Pedula 
et al (2006), who also used habitual, binocular viewing conditions.26 When using all-cause 
mortality as the outcome measure, these investigators found that both high contrast acuity 
and contrast sensitivity were independent predictors. Although these authors state that Pelli- 
Robson contrast sensitivity was used, the description provided appears to be for grating 
contrast sensitivity, so test differences could contribute to the lack of agreement between the 
studies. Furthermore, since the data in that study were evaluated in quartiles of increased 
impairment, it is difficult to compare directly to the current study or to address in 
relationship to clinically meaningful standards. 
It is likely that the non-standard vision measures investigated in the current study serve as 
surrogates for some eye conditions that have been shown to be associated with mortality. 
We would hypothesize that failure on such tests in the presence of normal visual acuity is 
indicative of subclinical eye disease. As stated previously, eye diseases such as cataracts, 
age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma are significantly associated with mortality. 
We cannot directly test this hypothesis, because information on eye disease was not 
available for all participants. Although all participants were asked to provide permission to 
access their eye records, many records were unavailable due to: participant refusal, records 
were not provided by the participant's eye practitioner, and several participants reported 
never having seen an eye doctor. Furthermore, many of the records obtained were not 
concurrent with vision test dates in a manner that would allow us to definitively say whether 
the participant had eye disease at the baseline test. 
Complete information on all three age-related eye conditions was available for 803 
participants (89.2% of the sample). Partial information (incomplete for one or two eye 
conditions) was available for 73 participants (8.1% of the sample), and no information was 
available for an additional 24 participants (2.7% of the sample). When separate analyses 
including existing eye condition information were conducted (either excluding those with 
missing data or using imputation techniques to replace missing values), the pattern of results 
was similar to that reported in Tables 4 and 5. As expected, the associations between each of 
the spatial vision measures and mortality were reduced. 
Further research is needed to assess the potential public health impact of this finding. We 
suggest that, in addition to regular medical and vision screenings, older individuals could be 



given simple non-standard vision tests, and those who do poorly could be evaluated in a 
more comprehensive health evaluation. 
In conclusion, we find that non-standard vision tests, and in particular low contrast, low 
luminance acuity and visual field integrity in the absence or presence of an additional 
attentional task, are significant predictors of mortality within 10 years in this sample of 
community-dwelling elders. Furthermore, these non-standard vision tests appear to be more 
sensitive predictors of mortality than high contrast acuity in this elderly sample.
