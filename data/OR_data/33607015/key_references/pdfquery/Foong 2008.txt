Objective: To examine the relationship between visual acuity and mortality in a Chinese population. 
Design: Population-based cohort study. 
Participants: Chinese persons in Singapore ages 40 to 79 years at baseline examination. 
Methods: The Tanjong Pagar Study in Singapore examined 1232 persons (response rate, 71.8%) at the baseline 
examination in 1997 and 1998. Participants had measurements of presenting and best-corrected visual acuity (VA) 
using standardized protocols. Mortality data were obtained from the National Death Registry, which linked subjects 
who had died since the baseline examination. Cause of death was determined from the International Classiﬁcation of 
Diseases 9 codes. Analysis was performed on 1225 (99.4%) participants with VA data. 
Main Outcome Measure: All-cause mortality. 
Results: By December 31, 2004 (median follow-up, 6.8 years), 126 persons had died. Participants with 
presenting VA in the better eye worse than 20/40 (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] score, 
0.3) had a signiﬁcantly higher mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR], 2.9; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.4 – 6.3, 
adjusting for age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, heart attack, stroke, and income) as compared with 
participants with VA of 20/20 (logMAR, 0.0). Associations were similar for best-corrected VA in the better eye (HR, 
2.7; 95% CI, 1.4 –5.5). Among clinic participants with logMAR VA measurements, each 1-line difference in 
presenting VA (logMAR gain, 0.10) was associated with a 4-fold increased risk of mortality (HR, 4.4; 95% CI, 
1.9 –10.2). 

In this Chinese population in Singapore, visual impairment was associated independently with 
an increased risk of mortality. Ophthalmology 2008;115:802– 807 © 2008 by the American Academy of Oph-

Visual impairment is a signiﬁcant public health problem 
and is associated with ocular morbidity and poorer 
quality of life. Emerging evidence suggests that visual

impairment also is an independent marker for mortality. 
Population-based studies, largely among white persons, 
have shown that poorer visual acuity (VA) signiﬁcantly 
increases the risk of death.1–9 In the 14-year follow-up of 
the Beaver Dam Eye Study in Wisconsin, best-corrected 
VA of 20/40 (logarithm of the minimum angle of reso- 
lution [logMAR] score, 0.3) or worse was associated with 
increased mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% conﬁ- 
dence interval [CI], 1.04 –1.48) while controlling for 
demographic, lifestyle, and various systemic risk factors 
for mortality.9 
To the best of our knowledge, no data show an associa- 
tion between VA and mortality in Asian populations. In this 
study, we examined the relationship between VA and mor- 
tality in a population-based cohort of urban Chinese adults 
aged 40 to 79 years at baseline residing in Singapore.

between October, 1997, and August, 1998.10,11 The study was 
approved by the ethics committee of the Singapore National Eye 
Center and was carried out in accordance with the tenets of the World 
Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed 
consent was obtained from all participants. Detailed population se- 
lection and methodology were described previously.10 –16 Brieﬂy, the 
names of 2000 Chinese persons aged 40 to 79 years residing in the 
Tanjong Pagar district was selected from the 1996 electoral register 
(13% of 15 082 names) using a disproportionate (with more weights 
given to the older age groups), stratiﬁed, clustered, random sampling 
procedure. Of the 1717 persons considered eligible to participate, 
1090 underwent a comprehensive eye examination at the research 
clinic and a further 142 were examined at their homes, bringing the 
total number of participants to 1232 (response rate, 71.8%). 
This study included participants from both the clinic and home 
examinations with VA measurements (n (cid:1) 1225; 99.4% of 1232). 
We also conducted a subanalysis among the 1088 participants 
(99.8% of 1090) who attended the research clinic examination, 
where VA was measured using logMAR charts at 4 m. 

Visual acuity was measured using standardized procedures previ- 
ously described. For all examinations conducted at the clinic, 
presenting VA was measured using logMAR charts at 4 m with 
distance correction, if any.11 Refractive error was assessed using 
an autorefractor, and best-corrected VA was obtained after sub- 
jective refraction.10 LogMAR scores for each eye for both pre- 
senting and best-corrected VA were recorded as the last line where 
3 letters or more were read correctly, in increments of 0.10.14 For 
home examinations, presenting VA was assessed using a Snellen 
chart at 3 m with distance correction, if any. If the reading was less 
than 20/40, VA was remeasured using a pinhole to ascertain 
best-corrected VA. Refractive error was measured using a hand- 
held autorefractor; subjective refraction was not assessed in home 
examinations. 
In our main analyses (n (cid:1) 1225), Snellen readings from home 
examinations were converted to equivalent logMAR scores and 
were combined with logMAR scores obtained from the clinic 
examination. Visual acuity then was categorized into none, mild, 
moderate, and severe reduction, corresponding to logMAR 
(Snellen) cutoffs of 0.00 (20/20), 0.18 (20/30), 0.30 (20/40), and 
more than 0.30 (more than 20/40). In our subanalysis of clinic 
participants (n (cid:1) 1088), VA also was analyzed as a continuous 
variable (per 0.10 difference in the logMAR score). 
Complete examinations of the anterior segment, fundus, and 
optic disc were conducted at the slit lamp using standardized 
lens opacity 
protocols. Ocular biometry, 
scores using the modiﬁed Lens Opacity Classiﬁcation System III, 
as well as blood pressure, height, and weight were recorded.11–13 
Information on medical history, smoking status, and socioeco- 
nomic indicators were obtained using interviewer-administered 
standard questionnaires.10 –16 

Hypertension was deﬁned as systolic blood pressure of 140 
mmHg or more, diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more, use 
of antihypertensive medication, or a combination thereof.15 Dia- 
betes was deﬁned as use of diet, oral diabetic medications, insulin 
injections, or a combination thereof.16 Cigarette smoking was 
deﬁned as either current or past/never. Heart attack and stroke 
were deﬁned from self-report (yes or no). Income was deﬁned as 
individual monthly income (no income/retired, Singapore $1– 
$1000, $1001–$1500, $1501–$2000, or more than $2000). 
Deﬁnitions of various ocular condition examined in the 
Tanjong Pagar Study, including presence of cataract (nuclear, 
cortical, posterior subcapsular), glaucoma, refractive errors 
(myopia, hypermetropia, astigmatism, anisometropia), under- 
corrected refractive error, and pterygium, were described pre- 
viously.10 –14 

The unique national registration identity card numbers, together 
with date of birth and gender, of the 1232 members of the original 
cohort were matched with mortality records maintained by the 
National Registry of Births and Deaths. Vital status as of Decem- 
ber 31, 2004, was determined for 100% of the participants. Infor- 
mation on the date of death and primary cause of death (given on 
the death certiﬁcate) for the participants were extracted. The un- 
derlying cause of death was reported using the International Clas- 
siﬁcation of Diseases 9 codes. Cancer mortality was deﬁned ac- 
cording to codes 140.0 to 208.9, 
ischemic heart disease was 
deﬁned according to codes 410.0 to 414.9, cerebrovascular disease 
was deﬁned according to mortality codes 430.0 to 438.9, and 
pneumonia, inﬂuenza, bronchitis, asthma were deﬁned according 
to codes 480.0 to 493.9. Previous studies using this system of 
identifying deaths and using International Classiﬁcation of Dis- 
eases 9 codes have been reported in Singapore.17 

Person-days were calculated for each participant from the date of 
individual examinations where VA was measured through Decem- 
ber 31, 2004. We used presenting and best-corrected VA data from 
the better eye for this study. Analyses using data from the right or 
left eye produced largely similar results (data not shown). 
To determine the association of VA and mortality, we estimated 
HRs and 95% CIs for all-cause mortality using Cox’s proportional 
hazards regression for stratiﬁed presenting VA and best-corrected 
VA groups (VA(cid:1)0.00, 0.00(cid:2)VA(cid:1)0.18, 0.18(cid:2)VA(cid:1)0.30, and 
VA(cid:3)0.30). The proportional hazard assumption was checked by 
plotting the log-minus-log plot of the estimated survival functions 
against log time. Plots of survival curves stratiﬁed by group were 
generated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was 
used for comparing different groups with respect to their survival 
distributions. We constructed 3 models: crude; adjusted for age 
and gender; and adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, 
smoking, heart attack, stroke, and income (multivariable model). 
All analyses were performed using SPSS software version 13.0 
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). 

Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of participants accord- 
ing to their better-eye presenting VA status. Persons with poorer 
presenting VA tended to be females, to have cataract or to have 
undergone cataract surgery, and to have undercorrected refractive 
error, regardless of age. 
By December 31, 2004 (median follow-up, 6.8 years), 126 
persons from the baseline cohort had died. After adjusting for age 
and gender, systemic correlates of mortality include hypertension 
(HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 –3.0), diabetes (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.6 – 4.0), 
smoking (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2–3.0), heart attack (HR, 1.7; 95% 
CI, 0.9 –3.0), stroke (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.0 – 4.7), and income (HR, 
2.0; 95% CI, 1.2–3.2, comparing retired/no income with income of 
Singapore $1–$1000; other income categories were not statisti- 
cally signiﬁcant [data not shown]). 
Table 2 shows mortality by better-eye presenting VA. In crude 
analysis, poorer presenting VA categories were associated strongly 
with mortality. Figure 1 shows the age- and gender-adjusted sur- 
vival curve for presenting VA categories. Persons with mild,

moderate, and severe reduction in presenting VA (presenting VA, 
worse than 20/20) had poorer survival compared with persons with 
normal vision (presenting VA, 20/20 or better; P(cid:2)0.001, log-rank 
test). The association between presenting VA and mortality was 
weakened but remained signiﬁcant after controlling for age, gen- 
der, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, heart attack, stroke, and 
income. In the ﬁnal multivariable model, participants with present- 
ing VA in the better eye worse than logMAR 0.3 had an HR of 2.9 
(95% CI, 1.4 – 6.3) as compared with participants with logMAR 
VA of 0.0. Associations were largely similar in the subanalysis of 
clinic participants, with a corresponding multivariate-adjusted HR of 
2.6 (95% CI, 1.2–5.7) comparing logMAR 0.3 versus logMAR 0.0. 
Table 3 shows results for better-eye best-corrected VA, and 
Figure 2 shows the age- and gender-adjusted survival curve for 
best-corrected VA categories (P(cid:2)0.001, log-rank test). In the ﬁnal 
multivariable model, as compared with participants with best- 
corrected logMAR VA of 0.0, participants with VA worse than 
logMAR 0.3 had an HR of 2.7 and 2.4, respectively, for all 
participants and clinic participants. 
Among clinic participants, a 1-line difference in presenting VA 
(logMAR increase, 0.10) was associated with a 4-fold increased 
risk in mortality (HR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.9 –10.2), after adjustment for 
independent predictors of mortality, including age, gender, hyper- 
tension, diabetes, smoking, heart attack, stroke, and income. The 
increase in mortality risk was more pronounced for every 1-line 
difference in best-corrected VA (HR, 6.8; 95% CI, 1.8 –25.9) after 
adjustment for the variables (data not shown). 
The underlying causes of death varied by presenting VA cat- 
egories. Persons with VA of 20/20 or better were more likely to die 
of cancer, whereas persons with VA worse than 20/40 were more 
likely to die of other causes that included diabetes, renal failure, 
and injury. However, the number of deaths was too small to detect 
any signiﬁcant pattern in the causes of death by increasing severity 
of visual impairment.

In addition to VA, we examined the association of cataract 
(nuclear, cortical, posterior subcapsular, cataract surgery), glau- 
intraocular pressure, refractive errors (myopia, hyper- 
coma, 
metropia, astigmatism, anisometropia), undercorrected refractive 
error, pterygium, and ocular biometry parameters (axial length and 
vitreous chamber depth) with mortality. We did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant 
associations for any of these conditions (data not shown). 

Our study demonstrates the relationship of presenting and 
best-corrected VA with mortality in an urban Chinese pop- 
ulation in Singapore. We showed that persons with present- 
ing VA worse than 20/20 (logMAR, 0.0) had a 3-fold higher 
risk of death as compared with persons with normal vision 
(VA, 20/20 or better), independent of other predictors of 
mortality. The risk of death increased 4-fold for every 1-line 
decrease of presenting VA. After best correction, persons 
with VA worse than 20/40 (logMAR, 0.3) also had a higher 
risk of death after multivariate adjustments. 
These results are consistent with ﬁndings from other 
population-based studies in Western countries that have 
documented the relationship of VA and mortality (Table 4).

Most of these studies deﬁned visual impairment by best- 
corrected VA measurements.1– 4,6,9 We found that the pre- 
dictive value of presenting VA for mortality was somewhat 
stronger than for best-corrected VA. It is possible that 
presenting VA reﬂects a person’s daily level of visual 
comfort and may affect mortality through intervening fac- 
tors such as falls,18 accidents,19 depression,8 and general 
quality of life.20 In this respect, we found that the causes of 
death were different between VA categories, with cancer 
being the leading cause of death in people with normal 
vision, and all others being the leading cause of death in 
people with poorer vision. We had limited numbers to 
examine speciﬁc causes further. 
We had small numbers of participants with VA poorer 
than 20/40. In a subsidiary analysis, we did not ﬁnd an 
association of bilateral low vision (deﬁned as best-corrected 
VA in the better eye of 20/60 –20/400) or blindness (worse 
than 20/400)13 with mortality (data not shown). Thompson 
et al1 found similar patterns in their study of the association 
between visual impairment and mortality, in which visual 
impairment was associated with increased mortality in per- 
sons with moderately poor VA but not in those with VA 
worse than 20/200. The authors suggest that this pattern 
may reﬂect that persons with extremely poor vision or 
blindness generally were better cared for by society than 
those with moderate visual impairment. 
Some, but not all, population-based studies have shown that 
increased mortality risk is associated with cataract,4,6,21–25 
glaucoma,26 diabetic retinopathy,9,27 and age-related macular 
degeneration.6,28 We did not ﬁnd a relationship between mor- 
tality and other ocular conditions measured in the Tanjong 
Pagar study, including refractive errors, ocular biometry pa- 
rameters (axial length and vitreous chamber depth), presence 
of cataract or cataract surgery, glaucoma, and pterygium. 



Limitations in our study should be discussed. Our study 
did not have standardized diagnosis for diabetic retinopathy 
and age-related macular degeneration, and retinal photo- 
graphs were not obtained. In addition, the sample size for 
this study was too small to permit potentially important 
subgroup analysis, such as mortality risk between men and 
women. A longer duration of follow-up for this population 
may provide more precise estimates of these associations. 
Our study was not designed to address the underlying 
biologic rationale for the relationship between VA and 
mortality. Nonetheless, studies of cataract and mortality 
have postulated that lens changes may reﬂect cellular pro- 
cesses associated with aging and accelerated mortality,9,23 
whereas others have indicated that severity of retinopathy 
serves as a marker of microvascular diseases affecting sys- 
temic functions in diabetics.24 However, we did not ﬁnd an 
association between lens opacity and mortality. In conclu- 
sion, we found a strong association of poor presenting and 
best-corrected VA and mortality in an urban Chinese pop- 
ulation in Singapore.
