Objective: To assess the association between mortal- 
ity and cause-specific visual impairment in older people. 
Methods: Visual acuity and causes of visual impairment 
were collected in 13 569 participants 75 years and older par- 
ticipating in a randomized trial of health screening. Partici- 
pantswerefollowedupformortalityforamedianof6.1years. 
Results: Compared with those with 6/6 (or 20/20 Snellen) 
or better visual acuity, the age- and sex-adjusted rate ratio 
for visually impaired people (binocular visual acuity (cid:1)6/18 
or (cid:1)20/60 Snellen) was 1.60 (95% confidence interval, 1.47- 
1.74), which was markedly attenuated (rate ratio, 1.17; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.07-1.27) after adjustment for con- 
founding factors. People whose visual impairment was due 
to cataract or age-related macular degeneration had ex- 
cess risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, which 
disappeared after adjustment. People with refractive error 
remained at small risk, despite adjustment, probably ow- 
ing to residual confounding from factors associated with 
minimal use of eye services rather than underlying eye dis- 
ease. There were no associations with cancer mortality. 
Conclusion: Associations reported for visual impair- 
ment and mortality or for specific causes of visual im- 
pairment reflect confounding by comorbidities, risk fac- 
tors, and other factors related to susceptibility to death 
rather than an independent biological association of vi- 
sion problems or specific eye diseases. 


association between reduced 
visual acuity and increased 
mortality. The interpretation 
of this association remains un- 
clear. If reduced visual acuity is causally re- 
lated to an increased risk of death, this might 
reflect the presence of age-related eye dis- 
eases, particularly cataract or age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD), which may 
be a marker for more generalized biologi- 
cal aging. Studies have reported associa- 
tions between mortality and cataract1,8-21 but 
not AMD.1,8,22 If age-related eye diseases are 
markers of aging, controlling for confound- 
ing factors, particularly chronic disease and 
indicators of frailty, should reduce or re- 
move the observed association. Previous 
studies varied in the amount of informa- 
tion available on potential confounding fac- 
tors, and the results have been conflicting. 
In the Beaver Dam Eye Study,8 visual im- 
pairment was associated with reduced sur- 
vival, but after controlling for a range of sys- 
temic factors, the association was attenuated 
and became nonsignificant, with only se- 
vere nuclear sclerotic cataract showing a 
small association with reduced survival. In- 
vestigators for the Rotterdam Study22 and 
the Melbourne Visual Impairment Project4 
reported no significant increase in risk with 
cataract (or with a specific type of cataract 
in the latter study) or AMD after adjust- 
ment for other risk factors for mortality. 
Other studies1,4,15,19,20 reported that the as- 
sociation with mortality remains after con- 
trolling for different comorbid conditions. 
A further unresolved question relates to sex, 
with some studies reporting an increased 
mortality risk associated with cataract in 
women10 or with cataract and coronary heart 
disease in women21 but not in men.23 
We examined the mortality and cause- 
specific mortality risk associated with 
visual impairment as part of a large popu- 
lation-based trial of health screening of older 
people in the United Kingdom. In addition 
to having information about the underly- 
ing causes of visual impairment, we had 
detailed data on a broad range of potential 
confounding factors. Participants were con- 
siderably older than those included in the 
previously reported studies.

multidimensional screening in people 75 years and older. Full 
details of the trial protocol have been published elsewhere.24 A 
total of 106 general practices (family practices) from the United 
Kingdom MRC General Practice Research Framework were re- 
cruited to the trial. The sampling of practices was stratified by 
tertiles of the standardized mortality ratio (mortality experi- 
ence of a local area relative to the national mortality) and the 
Jarman25 score (a measure of area deprivation) to ensure a rep- 
resentative sample of the mortality experience and deprivation 
levels of general practices in the United Kingdom. Practices were 
randomized to 2 groups, universal vs targeted screening. In the 
universal screening group, all participants were invited to have 
a detailed health assessment by a study nurse that included vi- 
sual acuity. All patients 75 years and older who were registered 
with participating general practices were included in the study 
unless they resided in a long-stay hospital or psychogeriatric care 
facility or were terminally ill. People in sheltered or residential 
housing for older persons were included. For the analyses pre- 
sented herein, 368 people with severe dementia, defined as a Mini- 
Mental State Examination26 score less than 12, were excluded 
because it was considered possible that their visual acuity mea- 
surements might be unreliable. 
The baseline assessments were performed between 1995 and 
1999. The study was approved by the relevant local research 
ethics committees of the participating practices. 
ASSESSMENT OF PARTICIPANTS 
People in the 53 general practices randomly allocated to the uni- 
versal screening arm of the trial were given a visual acuity test 
as part of a detailed health assessment by the study nurse. Vi- 
sual acuity was measured at 3 m with Glasgow acuity cards,27 
which measure the minimal angle of resolution on a logarith- 
mic scale (logMAR). Binocular visual acuity was measured first, 
followed by visual acuity in the right and left eyes. All visual acu- 
ity measurements were conducted with usual spectacle correc- 
tion. People with visual acuity of 0.5 (20/60 Snellen visual acu- 
ity) or more in either eye (equivalent to (cid:1)6/18 [20/60 Snellen 
visual acuity]) were retested with a pinhole occluder. If visual 
acuity did not improve to less than 0.5 and the cause of visual 
loss had not previously been investigated, the person was re- 
ferred to an ophthalmologist. If visual acuity improved to less 
than 0.5, the patient was advised to see an optometrist. All study 
nurses and nurse supervisors (responsible for quality control) 
attended a 2-day training session on the study procedures, which 
included training by 2 of us ( J.R.E. and R.P.L.W.) and practice 
sessions in the use of the Glasgow acuity cards. In addition, nurse 
supervisors made visits every 3 months to each general practice 
during the year the assessment was carried out for quality as- 
surance, including observation of the visual acuity testing. 
The detailed assessment also covered a wide range of physi- 
cal, social, and psychological problems. Potential confound- 
ers of any association between visual impairment (and under- 
lying eye problems) and mortality were selected on the basis 
of previous findings in the literature, hypothesized associa- 
tions based on known or postulated risk factors for eye dis- 
eases (such as smoking for cataract and AMD), markers of frailty 
and aging (such as low body mass index and functional im- 
pairments), and social and socioeconomic indicators that might 
reflect minimal contact with health services. 
CAUSE OF VISUAL IMPAIRMENT 
All 53 practices taking part in the universal screening arm of the 
trial were approached to take part in the study of the cause of vi- 
sual impairment. Forty-nine general practices agreed to take part. 
Full details have been published elsewhere.28 In brief, a list was 
compiled of visually impaired people (defined as having a base- 
line binocular visual acuity (cid:1)6/18 [logMAR (logarithm of mini- 
mum angle resolution) score (cid:2)0.5]). Among people who achieved 
a pinhole visual acuity in either eye of 6/18 or better, the princi- 
pal reason for visual impairment was refractive error, and fur- 
ther information on the cause of visual impairment was only sought 
for the remaining people who had no pinhole visual acuity or 
whose pinhole visual acuity did not improve to better than 6/18. 
The study nurse in each general practice was sent a list of people 
with visual impairment for their practice. The study nurse ab- 
stracted diagnostic information from the general practitioner’s 
notes. This diagnostic information was obtained from correspon- 
dence between the hospital ophthalmologist and the general prac- 
titioner. The nurse used a form that included the date and source 
of correspondence, results of any visual acuity test, diagnosis, and 
treatment. The nurse also recorded the name and location of the 
last hospital ophthalmologist seen. All correspondence relating 
to eye disease was abstracted, including the correspondence re- 
sulting from the MRC Trial examination. The forms were re- 
turned to one of us ( J.R.E.), who coded them twice. A maxi- 
mum of 3 diagnoses was recorded. The main cause of visual 
impairment was considered the cause of visual loss in the eye that 
most recently had lost visual acuity. If the main cause of visual 
loss was unclear, the 2 main diagnoses were each assumed to con- 
tribute equally to the visual loss. 
To validate the cause of visual loss obtained from coding 
the diagnostic information obtained from the general practi- 
tioner’s notes, a 1-page questionnaire was sent to the hospital 
ophthalmologist who had last seen the patient. This question- 
naire was in the form of a checklist by eye that covered AMD 
(exudative and geographic atrophy), cataract (age related, con- 
genital, and other), glaucoma (primary open angle, primary 
closed angle, or both), diabetes mellitus (diabetic retinopathy 
and other), myopic degeneration, and “other.” The ophthal- 
mologist was asked to rank, if possible, any conditions noted 
in order of their contribution to the cause of visual loss. In ad- 
dition, he or she recorded which eye most recently had lost vi- 
sual acuity and the visual acuity at the last examination. Agree- 
ment between the ophthalmologists and study nurses as to the 
cause of visual loss was good ((cid:3)=0.81). 
MORTALITY OUTCOME 
Most participants (13 561/13 569 [99.9%]) were registered for 
mortality follow-up with the United Kingdom government’s Of- 
fice for National Statistics, which provided factual details and 
the cause of death (using International Classification of Dis- 
eases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] and Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes). 
Analyses presented in this article are based on deaths re- 
corded up to July 31, 2003. Eighty-five percent of deaths were 
recorded using ICD-9 codes and 15% by ICD-10 codes. For the 
major causes of death examined in this article, there were no 
difficulties encountered in combining ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
Analyses were performed using Stata 8 software,29 considering 
the clustered design of the study (ie, general practice).30 Pois- 
son regression modeling was performed with all-cause, cardio- 
vascular disease, and cancer mortality rates as the outcomes of 
interest. Initially, all-cause mortality rates by level of visual acu- 
ity (irrespective of cause) were modeled, with people having a 
visual acuity of 6/6 (20/20 Snellen) or better as the baseline ref- 
erence group. Death rates among people with visual impair- 
ment (binocular visual acuity (cid:1)6/18 not attributable to refrac- 
tive error) compared with people with visual acuity of 6/6 or 
better were then modeled separately for the main causes of vi- 
sual impairment, including refractive error, AMD, and cata- 
ract and other less common causes. Because some people with 
a history of cataract extraction may not have been visually im-

paired, people with any history of cataract irrespective of their 
visual acuity were compared with people with no history of cata- 
ract and visual acuity of 6/6 or better. 
Age and sex were included as covariates at all stages. Poten- 
tial confounding factors were the following: body mass index (low- 
est fifth), inability (worst fifth) to carry out activities of daily liv- 
ing (washing self, dressing self, cutting toenails, cooking, 
shopping, doing light housework, walking 50 yards [45.7 m], 
and going up and down stairs and steps), presence of a major 
illness at baseline (fractured hip, Parkinson disease, cancer, or 
depression requiring treatment), history of cardiovascular dis- 
ease (probable angina on the Rose questionnaire31 or reported 
stroke or heart attack), diabetes mellitus, hypertension (re- 
ported or current systolic blood pressure (cid:4)160 mm Hg or dia- 
stolic blood pressure (cid:4)90 mm Hg), geriatric depression score 
of 6 or higher,32 daily urinary incontinence, Mini-Mental State 
Examination score (categorized as 12-17, 18-23, or 24-30), re- 
ported number falls in the previous 6 months (categorized as 
0, 1, or (cid:2)2), hearing problems (failed whispered voice test and 
not having a hearing aid), socioeconomic indicators (home 
owner, quintiles of the Carstairs deprivation score33 derived from 
postcode linkage to 2001 census variables, and self-reported 
financial difficulties), self-reported health (excellent/very good, 
good, or fair/poor), low self-reported physical activity levels, 
smoking history (never, previous, or current), alcohol intake 
(never, previous, below the median, or above the median), and 
social isolation (rare contact with relatives and friends or re- 
cent bereavement). Testing for interaction by age and sex was 
undertaken using the final models obtained. 

In the 49 general practices taking part in the study, 19 914 
eligible persons were invited to have a health assess- 
ment, and 14 375 attended, for a response rate of 72.2%. 
Among people who responded, 500 had missing data on 
visual acuity, and an additional 306 persons scored less 
than 12 on the Mini-Mental State Examination, leaving 
13 569 persons included in the analyses. 
The mean age of participants was 81.1 years; 38.9% 
were men. Among 1632 persons (12.0%) who had a base- 
line binocular visual acuity less than 6/18, visual impair- 
ment was attributed to refractive error in 440 (27.0%), 
AMD in 479 (29.4%), cataract in 328 (20.1%), and other 
causes in 239 (14.6%). (Some participants had more than 
1 diagnosis and were counted more than once.) The lat- 
ter group comprised 64 persons with glaucoma, 29 with 
myopic degeneration, 26 with diabetic eye disease, 7 with 
vascular occlusion, and the rest with rarer conditions. Data 
were unavailable about the cause of visual loss for 285 
persons (17.5%) with visual impairment. 
Table 1 gives the distribution of baseline character- 
istics. Compared with persons with normal visual acu- 
ity, visually impaired people were older, were more likely 
to be female, and had poorer health across several con- 
ditions and diseases, including depression and cogni- 
tive function (low Mini-Mental State Examination score). 
Visually impaired people were more likely to report dif- 
ficulties in performing activities of daily living, rate their 
health as poor, have low levels of physical activity, and 
live in areas of higher deprivation, and they were less likely 
to be home owners. These patterns were similar across 
the disease and condition groups. In age- and sex- 
adjusted analyses, there was a strong association be- 
tween decreasing visual acuity and increasing mortality 
(Table 2). The rate ratios were substantially attenu- 
ated after adjustment for confounders, but a small ex- 
cess risk remained significant for those with a visual acu- 
ity worse than 6/9 compared with those with normal visual 
acuity ((cid:2)6/6). In analyses by type of eye problem, in- 
creased risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were 
observed for all eye problems, including refractive error 
and visual impairment in which the underlying prob- 
lem could not be ascertained (Table 3 and Table 4). 
Adjustment for potential confounding factors markedly 
reduced the rate ratios. For example, for all-cause mor- 
tality, the excess risk associated with AMD was reduced 
from 1.40 in an age- and sex-adjusted model to 1.01 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.81-1.25) in a fully adjusted 
model. The fully adjusted rate ratio for cataract was 1.04 
(95% CI, 0.84-1.28), and for other eye diseases it was 0.90 
(95% CI, 0.72-1.12). A small excess risk remained for 
those whose cause of visual impairment could not be as- 
certained (rate ratio, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.02-1.75). Similar 
results were seen for cardiovascular mortality, with high 
age- and sex-adjusted ratios for different eye diseases much 
attenuated after adjustment for the full range of poten- 
tial confounding factors. However, for those with refrac- 
tive error and whose cause of visual impairment was un- 
known, an excess risk persisted after adjustment. There 
were no significant associations between type of eye dis- 
ease and cancer mortality (Table 5). There was little evi- 
dence that any of these associations differed by age or 
sex. None of the interaction terms was statistically sig- 
nificant by adjusted Wald test, including (age [4 groups] 
or sex)(cid:5) (binocular visual acuity [4 groups] or [refrac- 
tive error or AMD or cataract or other causes]). Approxi- 
mately 30% of persons reported having had a cataract. 
Comparing persons who had reported a cataract or cur- 
rently had a cataract vs persons who had not, the fully 
adjusted rate ratio was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.90-1.10). 

Our study found a strong association between reduced vi- 
sual acuity and mortality risk, which was markedly attenu- 
ated after controlling for a broad range of confounding fac- 
tors. Previous studies also found an association between 
visual impairment and mortality. In the Melbourne Visual 
Impairment Project,4 visually impaired persons (visual acu- 
ity (cid:1)6/12 [(cid:1)20/40 Snellen]) had a 2-fold increased risk 
of death compared with persons not visually impaired (vi- 
sual acuity (cid:2)6/12), although only a few potential con- 
founding factors was considered. The results of that study 
also suggested that the highest risk was observed in per- 
sons with visual acuity ranging from less than 6/12 to 6/18 
or better, with decreasing risk below that cutoff for poorer 
visual acuity. We found a small increasing mortality risk 
across the categories of worsening visual acuity. In com- 
mon with other investigations, we explored whether the 
risk observed for visual impairment was due to the under- 
lying eye disease or problem. In analyses adjusted for age 
and sex, we observed strong associations for AMD, cata- 
ract, and other ocular diseases with all-cause and cardio- 
vascular mortality, but adjustment for confounders re- 
moved these associations. In the Rotterdam Study,22 an

association between AMD and mortality also disappeared 
after adjustment for several cardiovascular risk factors, in- 
cluding measures of atherosclerosis and cholesterol. 
We found no evidence for an association of cataract 
with cancer mortality. In 4 studies1,8,19,20 among 5 that 
reported an association of cataract with mortality that per- 
sisted after adjustment for confounding, the association 
was not with cardiovascular mortality but with cancer 
or other causes of death. Only in the Nurses’ Study was 
cataract associated with fatal and nonfatal coronary heart 
disease.21 The associations with cancer and other causes 
of death may therefore reflect residual confounding by 
other factors related to these causes of death that were 
not controlled for in the analysis. It could be argued that 
a lack of specificity with cause of death makes an inde- 
pendent and causal association with cataract less plau- 
sible. Conversely, if cataract is regarded as one of a broad 
spectrum of age-related diseases, including cancer, that 
are due to common biological processes such as oxida- 
tive stress, associations with a range of causes of death 
might be expected. In our study and in the Blue Moun- 
tains Eye Study,1 an increased mortality was observed for 
persons with correctable refractive error. We also found 
an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality for per-

refractive error with mortality reflects biological aging 
but rather that uncorrected refractive error is indicative 
of minimal use of optometry services and associated with 
characteristics prognostic of death. A recent study34 in 
the United Kingdom reported that 96% of older people 
with visually impairing refractive errors had no contact 
with eye care services. Although we attempted to con- 
trol for factors expected to be related to minimal health 
service use (such as social isolation and low socioeco- 
nomic status), we had no direct information about con- 
tact with optometry services and may have inadequately 
controlled for this. It is also possible that the associa-

tions between cataract and mortality reported in other 
studies reflect confounding by factors related to mini- 
mal use of health services. Persons with visually impair- 
ing unoperated cataracts have been shown to be of lower 
socioeconomic status and to have reduced contact with 
eye services in several developed countries,34,35 includ- 
ing the United Kingdom, where cataract surgery is free. 
In our study, we were unable to ascertain the cause of 
visual impairment in 285 persons. The excess mortality 
for this group persisted after adjustment for confound- 
ers. This group had a higher mortality than other groups, 
suggesting that the reason for nonascertainment of the 
cause of visual impairment was linked to poor health. This 
was confirmed by analyses that found no excess mortal- 
ity risk for this group after excluding 10.0% of the popu- 
lation with the shortest follow-up ((cid:1)1.8 years). We found 
no interaction between sex and mortality, in contrast to 
a previous United Kingdom study10 that found a higher 
mortality in nondiabetic women but not men. Again, we 
suggest that this may reflect factors associated with mini- 
mal health service use because a previous report from that 
study documented a higher prevalence of untreated vi- 
sually impairing cataracts in women, with 88% of people 
with untreated cataracts having no contact with ophthal- 
mic services.34 
Our population was 75 years and older (as this was the 
age criterion for the health screening trial), and in this age 
group the effects of eye diseases on mortality may be dif- 
ferent from those at younger ages. This is unlikely to hold 
for AMD because most people with this condition are older. 
For example, in the Rotterdam Study,22 which recruited 
subjects 55 years and older, the mean age of participants 
with AMD was 82 years, similar to our study. The mean 
ages of participants in previous trials have been younger 
than in our study, although most included people in the 
same age range as ours. It is likely that the prevalence of 
comorbid conditions will be lower in studies with propor- 
tionately younger people and that the effects of confound- 
ing may be less. Studies also varied in the length of follow- 
up (a median of 6.1 years in our study and 2 years,20 4 years,19 
5 years,4 6 years,1 and 10 years15 in other studies). The effect 
of comorbidity is most likely to be seen in studies with 
shorter follow-up. Conversely, for studies with longer 
follow-up, the information on baseline confounders may 
not reflect changes in these factors during follow-up and 
so may lead to misclassification of confounders. Most stud- 
ies with a wider age range would lack power to examine 
whether the results varied according to age. In the Nurses’ 
Study21of more than 60 000 women (mean age, 53 years), 
cataract extraction in 2300 women would have had ad- 
equate power, but the study did not report the results by 
age group. Even in that study, with a much younger age 
group than ours, the effects of confounding were substan- 
tial, reducing the risk of mortality from 1.70 in the age- 
adjusted analyses to 1.37 in the multivariate analyses. 
There are several limitations of our study. Other than a 
visual acuity test, we did not carry out detailed eye exami- 
nations of the trial participants; therefore, we have no in- 
formation on persons with early lens opacities or age- 
related maculopathy that were not associated with visual 
impairment (binocular visual acuity (cid:1)6/18). However, the 
literature does not suggest that there is an association of 
mortality with early signs of these conditions. In previous 
studies, age-related maculopathy, which includes early signs 
such as drusen and pigmentary irregularities, was not as- 
sociated with mortality even in analyses adjusted only for 
age and sex.1,4,8,22 However, severe nuclear opacities8,20 and 
mixed lens opacities (an indication of severity)15,19 were as- 
sociated with poorer survival, while the magnitude of as- 
sociation was weaker or nonexistent for earlier lens changes. 
We were unable to examine whether there were differ- 
ences in mortality by type of cataract. Most previously re- 
ported associations with mortality have been with mixed 
opacities (always including nuclear opacities) or with 
nuclear opacities alone. Nuclear opacities are the most com- 
mon type of opacities in white populations; therefore, it is 
likely that the type of cataract was nuclear in our predomi- 
nantly white population. We attempted to minimize er- 
rors in measuring visual acuity through training the study 
nurses, with subsequent quality control. Although an oph- 
thalmologist (R.P.L.W.) was present at the training ses- 
sions, we made no formal attempt to examine the inter-

rater agreement. We cannot exclude the possibility that some 
misclassification of visual acuity may have occurred. The 
fact that we demonstrated a dose-response effect of mor- 
tality by visual acuity group (categorized as (cid:2)6/6, (cid:1)6/6 to 
(cid:2)6/9 [(cid:2)20/30 Snellen], (cid:1)6/9 to (cid:2)6/18, and (cid:1)6/18) lends 
credibility to the findings. For the classification of ocular 
conditions, there was good agreement between the data ex- 
tracted from the general practitioners’ records and those 
of the hospital ophthalmologists, but again some misclas- 
sification may exist as to the main causes of visual impair- 
ment. It is implausible that any such misclassification of 
visual acuity or type of ocular condition would have been 
biased by outcome, as mortality was independently ascer- 
tained from national data. Any possible effect of misclas- 
sification would be to dilute the rate ratios toward the null. 
Bias due to misclassification of visual acuity or specific ocu- 
lar conditions would not affect the findings that most of 
the excess risk in mortality associated with visual impair- 
ment can be explained by confounding factors. Informa- 
tion on all potential confounders included in the model was 
available for 76.4% of the cohort, but the age- and sex- 
adjusted rate ratios for those with full data and those with 
missing data on all confounders were similar. 
A strength of our study was the size of the sample, the 
information about cause-specific mortality, and the detailed 
data on health and social status. The latter factor in particu- 
lar allowed us to control for confounding more fully than 
many other studies. We conclude that the associations re- 
ported for visual impairment with mortality or for specific 
causes of visual impairment reflect confounding by comor- 
bidities, risk factors, and other variables related to suscep- 
tibility to death rather than a true independent biological 
association with visual problems or specific eye diseases.
