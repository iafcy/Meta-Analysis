Objective: to examine the relationships between impairments in hearing and vision and mortality from all-causes and cardio- 
vascular disease (CVD) among older people. 
Design: population-based cohort study. 


Participants: the study population included 4,926 Icelandic individuals, aged ≥67 years, 43.4% male, who completed vision 
and hearing examinations between 2002 and 2006 in the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES-RS) 
and were followed prospectively for mortality through 2009. 
Methods: participants were classiﬁed as having ‘moderate or greater’ degree of impairment for vision only (VI), hearing only 
(HI), and both vision and hearing (dual sensory impairment, DSI). Cox proportional hazard regression, with age as the time 
scale, was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) associated with impairment and mortality due to all-causes and speciﬁcally 
CVD after a median follow-up of 5.3 years. 
Results: the prevalence of HI, VI and DSI were 25.4, 9.2 and 7.0%, respectively. After adjusting for age, signiﬁcantly 
(P < 0.01) increased mortality from all causes, and CVD was observed for HI and DSI, especially among men. After further 
adjustment for established mortality risk factors, people with HI remained at higher risk for CVD mortality [HR: 1.70 (1.27– 
2.27)], whereas people with DSI remained at higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR: 1.43 (1.11–1.85)] and CVD mortality [HR: 
1.78 (1.18–2.69)]. Mortality rates were signiﬁcantly higher in men with HI and DSI and were elevated, although not signiﬁcantly, 
among women with HI. 
Conclusions: older men with HI or DSI had a greater risk of dying from any cause and particularly cardiovascular causes 
within a median 5-year follow-up. Women with hearing impairment had a non-signiﬁcantly elevated risk. Vision impairment 
alone was not associated with increased mortality.

older people 

Both vision and hearing loss are common age-related condi- 
tions, associated with poor health outcomes, including func- 
tional disability, depression and cognitive decline [1–9]. 
Numerous studies in diverse populations suggest sensory 
impairments (SI) are predictors of decreased survival, inde- 
pendent of other traditional mortality risk factors such as 
hypertension and diabetes [10–17]. However, data from the 
UK [18] and Australia [19] indicate that the association 
between visual impairment and mortality reﬂects concomi- 
tant morbidities. Similarly, an association between hearing 
impairment 
(HI) and mortality in the Blue Mountains 
Hearing study [20] became non-signiﬁcant after adjustment 
for risk factors. Analyses linking data from the National 
Health Interview Survey with the National Death Index in 
the USA suggested that deaf participants experienced decre- 
ased survival, but this ﬁnding was attributed to their lower 
self-reported health status [21]. The joint effects of SI on 
health outcomes, 
including mortality risk, have not been 
investigated fully, particularly when compared with a single 
impairment [14]. 
As the population ages, the prevalence of hearing and 
visual impairments is expected to increase. This paper exam- 
ines the risk of mortality associated with these impairments 
in the AGES-RS [22]. 


Participants of AGES-RS, a population-based study designed 
to investigate genetic and environmental risk factors of 
health, disease and disability in older adults, contributed to 
this analysis. The Icelandic Heart Association (IHA) initiated 

the Reykjavik Study in 1967, sampling 30,795 people born 
between 1907 and 1935 and living in Reykjavik, Iceland. 
From the original cohort, 11,549 were alive in 2002, and a 
random sample of 5,764 (mean age 77 years, range 67–98 
years) participated in AGES-RS. Both vision and hearing 
examinations were completed by 4,944 (85.8%) participants 
between 2002 and 2006 [22]. Eighteen participants were 
excluded due to insufﬁcient vision or hearing data for both 
eyes and both ears, resulting in 4,926 individuals for the 
current analysis. 
The AGES-RS protocol was approved by the Icelandic 
National Bioethics Committee (VSN: 00-063), the Icelandic 
Data Protection Authority and by the Institutional Review 
Board for the National Institute on Aging, National Institutes 
of Health, USA. Written informed consent was acquired from 
all participants. 

During the baseline eye examination, presenting visual acuity, 
aided by current corrective lenses, if any, was measured in 
each eye separately using a table-top Nidek ARK 760A 
Autorefractor (Nidek Co. Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) with built-in 
acuity charts. Vision impairment (VI) was deﬁned as a pre- 
senting visual acuity of 20/50 or worse in the better eye. 
Eyes that were blind were not excluded from this analysis. 
As with vision, the baseline hearing examination followed 
a standardized protocol. Pure-tone air-conduction audiom- 
etry was conducted in a sound-treated booth using an Inter- 
acoustics AD229e microprocessor audiometer (Interacoustics 
A/S, DK-5610, Assens, Denmark) with standard TDH-39P 
supra-aural audiometric headphones or E.A.R. tone 3A insert 
earphones (MEDI, Benicia, CA, USA). Hearing thresholds at 
frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 kHz 

with a repeat threshold test at 1 kHz for reliability) were mea- 
sured in each ear. When signiﬁcant inter-ear differences were 
found, re-tests were performed using insert earphones to maxi- 
mise the inter-aural attenuation. ‘Moderate or greater’ HI was 
deﬁned as at least 35 decibels (dB) hearing level (HL) for the 
pure-tone average of four frequencies (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz) in 
the better ear. This deﬁnition corresponds to ‘disabling’ HI as 
deﬁned by the Global Burden of Disease Hearing Loss 
Expert Group [23], and is the degree of hearing loss for which 
hearing aids are typically recommended. 

Mortality status was ascertained by the IHA, with permission 
of the Icelandic Data Protection Authority, using the com- 
plete, adjudicated registry of deaths available from the Icelandic 
National Roster maintained by Statistics Iceland (http://www. 
statice.is/Statistics/Population/Births-and-deaths). All-cause and 
cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality, assigned an 
ICD10 classiﬁcation, was available for all deaths recorded 
through 31 December 2009. 

Demographic characteristics, health behaviours and medical 
history were considered as covariates. Education was dichot- 
omized as secondary school graduation and higher versus 
less than secondary school completion. Smoking status was 
categorized as never, former or current smoker. The body 
mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by 
height (meters) squared. Hypertension was deﬁned as self- 
reported history of hypertension, use of antihypertensive 
drugs or blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg. Diabetes mellitus 
was deﬁned as self-reported history of diabetes, use of 
glucose-modifying medications, or fasting blood glucose of 
≥7.0 mmol/l. Blood samples were drawn after overnight 
fasting, and total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and HbA1c were measured 
in the IHA laboratory. HbA1c levels ≥6.5% were considered 
elevated. Depressive symptomology was deﬁned as a score 
of 6 or greater on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. 
Self-reported health status was dichotomized as good or 
poor based upon participants response to questions. Cog- 
nitive status was determined by professional consen- 
sus after reviewing results of cognitive examinations and 
dichotomized as normal or impaired. Falls during the past 
12 months were based on self-report. Walking disability 
was deﬁned as self-reported difﬁculty walking or the use of 
walking aids. A cardiovascular event was deﬁned by report 
of a myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery 
or angioplasty. 
Statistical methods 
SI was classiﬁed into four mutually exclusive groups, no/ 
mild/unilateral impairment, VI only, HI only or both VI and 
Participant 
HI 



characteristics were described using means and standard 
deviations for continuous variables and percentages and 
counts for categorical variables. Cox proportional hazards re- 
gression, adjusting for potential confounding risk factors, 
was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% conﬁ- 
dence intervals estimating risk of mortality for each impair- 
ment group. Since VI and HI increase with advancing age, as 
the participant’s age from their baseline 
does mortality, 
examination was used as the time-scale for this analysis. The 
mortality status of all participants was determined as of 31 
December 2009. Risk of mortality by the SI group was com- 
puted for participants of the same age, reported as HRs and 
graphically using Kaplan–Meier plots of survival past base- 
line examination. Since rates of sensory impairment and 
mortality differ for men and women, analyses were stratiﬁed 
by sex. Two-sided statistical tests and a 5% signiﬁcance level 
were employed. Covariates retained in the analytic models are 
noted in table footnotes. All analyses were conducted using 
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). 

Among 4,926 participants, sensory impairment was present 
in 2,048 (41.6%) participants, of whom 1,250 (25.4%) had 
HI only, 455 (9.2%) VI only and 343 (7.0%) DSI. Participant 
characteristics are shown by the impairment group in 
Table 1. The mean age of the VI, HI and DSI groups was 
signiﬁcantly higher compared with the unimpaired group. 
Among those with a given impairment, women were more 
likely than men to have VI (10.5 versus 7.6%, P = 0.10), 
whereas men were signiﬁcantly more likely than women to 
have HI or DSI (29.9 versus 22.0%, P < 0.01 and 8.6 versus 
5.7%, P < 0.01, respectively). After adjusting for age and 
sex, the impaired groups had signiﬁcantly less education, 
poorer self-reported health, more depressive symptomology, 
cognitive impairment, walking disability and higher rates of 
diabetes. 
Between their baseline examination and the end of the 
follow-up period (median follow-up, 5.3 years, range 3–7 
years), 846 (17.2%) individuals died, of which 360 (42.6%) 
were attributed to CVD. Participants who died were signiﬁ- 
cantly older (79.6 ± 5.7 versus 75.2 ± 4.9 years, P < 0.01) and 
more likely to be male (51.3 versus 39.8%, P < 0.01), a 
current or former smoker, report poor health, be cognitively 
impaired, have diabetes, a history of cancer, angina, CVD or 
cardiovascular event, higher HDL cholesterol 
levels and 
lower total cholesterol levels. 
All-cause and CVD-related mortality rates among men 
and women were signiﬁcantly different overall 
(both 
P < 0.01) and within each sensory impairment group, par- 
ticularly the DSI group (all-cause: no SI, P < 0.01; VI, 
P = 0.03; HI, P < 0.01; DSI, P < 0.01; interaction between 
sex and SI, P = 0.09 and CVD: no SI, P = 0.09; VI, P = 0.08; 
HI, P = 0.01; DSI, P < 0.01; interaction between sex and SI, 
P = 0.07). Men were more impaired and more severely 
impaired in vision and hearing compared with women

Data are presented as % (n) or mean (standard deviation). 
aDiabetes mellitus was defined as the self-reported history of diabetes, use of glucose-modifying medications or fasting blood glucose ≥7.0 mmol/l. 
bModerate VI is defined as a presenting visual acuity of 20/50, 20/60 or 20/80 and severe VI is defined as a presenting visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. 
cModerate, moderately severe and severe or greater HI are defined as better ear PTA values between 35 and 49.9, 50–64.9 and 65+ dB HL, respectively. ‘Disabling’ HI 
is moderate HI or worse, according to the Global Burden of Disease Hearing Loss Expert Team definition [23]. 
dOnly compared non-zero impairment groups. 
eOnly compared HI and DSI groups. 
*Age and sex varied significantly across impairment groups (P < 0.01). For all other baseline characteristics, the P-value measures whether differences exist across the 
four sensory impairment groups after adjusting for age and sex.

adjusted for age. 
(results not shown). Adjusting for age differences, Figure 1 
depicts mortality by sex for all-causes and CVD over the 
7-year follow-up period for the four impairment groups. 
Compared with the unimpaired group, after adjustment 
for sex and age, participants with HI were at higher risk of 
CVD-related mortality [HR: 1.52 (95% CI: 1.17–1.97)], 
whereas participants with DSI were at higher risk of death 
from any cause [HR: 1.50 (95% CI: 1.19–1.90)] or from 
CVD [HR: 1.80 (95% CI: 1.24–2.61)], as shown in Table 2. 
After adjusting for established mortality risk factors, includ- 
ing smoking, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, self-reported 
health status, cognitive status, self-reported history of falls, 
total cholesterol, baseline CVD history and hearing aid use, 
DSI remained associated with all-cause mortality [HR: 1.43 
(95% CI: 1.11–1.85)] and HI and DSI remained associated 
with CVD mortality [HRs: 1.70 (95% CI: 1.27–2.27) and 
1.78 (95% CI: 1.18–2.69), respectively]. 
Compared with unimpaired men, after multivariable ad- 
justment, men with DSI had increased risk of all-cause and 
CVD-related mortality [HRs: 1.73 (95% CI: 1.25–2.39) and 
2.65 (95% CI: 1.58–4.44), respectively], whereas HI was sig- 
niﬁcantly associated with CVD-related mortality [HR: 1.93 
(95% CI: 1.30–2.87)] but not with all-cause mortality [HR: 
1.20 (95% CI: 0.93–1.55)]. In women, associations between 
HI and all-cause or CVD-related mortality did not reach stat- 
istical signiﬁcance [HRs: 1.23 (95% CI: 0.93–1.64) and 1.44 
(95% CI: 0.93–2.22), respectively], and no associations were 
found between DSI and all-cause or CVD-related mortality. 
Among people with HI or DSI, users of hearing aids 
were, on average, older and had more severe hearing loss 
compared with people without hearing aids; however, 
hearing aid users had signiﬁcantly lower risk of all-cause 
mortality [HRs: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.58–0.96) for men and 0.67 
(95% CI: 0.49–0.92) 
for women] and, among men, 
CVD-related mortality risk [HR: 0.63 (95% CI: 0.42–0.92)]. 

This population-based study of community-dwelling older 
people found sensory impairment to be common and, for 
men with HI or DSI, associated with all-cause and 
CVD-related mortality. Whether sensory deﬁcits in men are 
an indicator of ageing or frailty, physical manifestations 
resulting in reduced social competence or a reﬂection of 
other adverse health states is unclear. The adverse risk in

men could not be attributed to smoking status, self-rated 
health, cognitive status, falls, walking disability or hearing aid 
use—all of which were observed to be important mortality 
risk factors in this study. The increase in mortality risk for 
men with HI and DSI was the main contributor to the 
signiﬁcant overall results for men and women combined. 
These overall results conﬁrm earlier reports of an association 
between DSI and increased risk of mortality in a combined 
sample of men and women [10, 15, 24]. Reuben et al. [5] did 
not ﬁnd an association between DSI and mortality, but their 
sample was younger (aged 55–74 years) and had only 36 par- 
ticipants with DSI compared with the 343 participants ages 
67 and older in the present study. 
HRs of mortality in women with HI were generally above 
one, ranging between 1.2 and 1.4, suggesting a possibility of 
modestly elevated risk. However, these results did not reach 
statistical signiﬁcance in this study. 
The literature on HI and mortality is sparse [20, 21]. The 
Blue Mountains Hearing Study [20] reported an association 
between HI and mortality but concluded that walking disabil- 
ity, cognitive impairment and self-rated health mediated the 
relationship. In the current analysis, when walking disability, 
cognitive impairment and self-reported health were taken 
into account, they did not explain the impact of HI on 
mortality. 
In our study VI was not signiﬁcantly associated with mor- 
tality, consistent with ﬁndings from the Blue Mountains Eye 
Study [19] and the UK [18]. There was a high prevalence of 

HI in our cohort; however, the number with deﬁcits solely in 
vision was relatively small. To assess mortality risk among all 
people with VI, we conducted a secondary analysis combin- 
ing the VI and DSI groups and again found no association 
with mortality (results not shown). We cannot explain why 
our results for VI are different from other studies [25–30], 
but it is possible the older ages in our cohort and other dif- 
ferences in health states experienced by this population may 
be important. 
A Japanese study of older adults aged 65+ years reported 
sex differences in HI and VI on risk of adverse health out- 
comes including mortality [12]. After covariate adjustment, 
increased risk of adverse health outcomes (including death) 
was reported for men with HI but not for women. No 
increased risk was reported for VI; DSI was not studied. 
After removing those using hearing aids, the increase in risk 
was not altered substantially. Hearing aid use was also consid- 
ered in the current study. Men and women with hearing aids 
tended to be older and to have more severe hearing loss 
compared with others with HI but without hearing aids. 
However, men and women wearing hearing aids had a decre- 
ased risk of dying. We have no ﬁrm explanation for this, but 
we know a hearing aid can reduce the social isolation often 
experienced by those with HI and possibly the sensorineural 
stimulation from the hearing aid itself may be important. 
The current study has several strengths including results 
based on a large cohort of older adults, a high participation 
rate, objective measurements for vision and hearing collected 

in a standardized manner, availability of a wide array of cov- 
ariates, and a complete, adjudicated registry of deaths. The 
study ascertained mortality prospectively and without regard 
for impairment status. However, some limitations exist. The 
population is exclusively white, and the health proﬁle of par- 
ticipants in this analysis was measured only once. Thus, 
increased mortality may result from an undocumented co- 
morbid condition arising after the baseline examination. 
Finally, although unlikely, the possibility of selection bias, 
between those who completed the vision and hearing exami- 
nations and participants who did not, could have inﬂuenced 
the results. 
In summary, older men with HI or DSI were at signiﬁ- 
cantly increased risk of all-cause and CVD-related mortality. 
Use of hearing aids mitigated a portion of this increased risk. 
Health professionals delivering care to older people need to 
realize multiple sensory impairments are common and, par- 
ticularly among men, may predict other adverse health condi- 
tions increasing risk of death. Regular assessment of sensory 
impairment and rehabilitation services targeted for those 
with decrements in hearing and vision in old age can 
promote enhanced quality of life, health and longevity. 

(cid:129) Men with HI and DSI had increased risk of all-cause or 
CVD-related mortality compared with men without any 
vision or HI. 
(cid:129) Unlike men, women with HI had only slightly higher rates 
of mortality compared with women without any sensory 
impairment. Women with DSI were not at higher risk of 
mortality compared with women without sensory impair- 
ments. 


(cid:129) Men and women who used hearing aids, although they 
were older and had more severe hearing loss, had signiﬁ- 
cantly lower mortality risk compared with hearing impaired 
men and women who did not use hearing aids.

Background: fear of falling (FOF) is common in older people and associated with serious physical and psychosocial conse- 
quences. Identifying those at risk of FOF can help target interventions to both prevent falls and reduce FOF. 
Objective: to identify factors associated with FOF. 
Study design: cross-sectional study in 1,088 community-dwelling older people aged ≥65 years. 
Methods: data were collected on socio-demographic characteristics, self-perceived health, exercise, risk factors for falls, FOF 
(Short FES-I), and functional measures. Logistic regression models of increasing complexity identiﬁed factors associated with 
FOF. 
Results: high FOF (Short FES-I ≥11) was reported by 19%. A simpler model (socio-demographic + falls risk factors) correct- 
ly classiﬁed as many observations (82%) as a more complex model (socio-demographic + falls risk factors + functional mea- 
sures) with similar sensitivity and speciﬁcity values in both models. There were signiﬁcantly raised odds of FOF in the simpler 
model with the following factors: unable to rise from a chair of knee height (OR: 7.39), lower household income (OR: 4.58), 
using a walking aid (OR: 4.32), difﬁculty in using public transport (OR: 4.02), poorer physical health (OR: 2.85), black/minor- 
ity ethnic group (OR: 2.42), self-reported balance problems (OR: 2.17), lower educational level (OR: 2.01) and a higher BMI 
(OR: 1.06).
