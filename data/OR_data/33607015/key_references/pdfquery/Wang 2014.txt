ABSTRACT. 
Purpose: To examine the relationship between major ocular diseases and 
mortality. 
Methods: The population-based longitudinal study Beijing Eye Study was 
performed in 2001 and repeated in 2011. The participants underwent a detailed 
ophthalmic examination at baseline in 2001. 
Results: Of 4439 subjects examined in 2001, 2695 (60.7%) subjects returned for 
the follow-up examination in 2011, while 379 (8.5%) subjects were dead and 
1365 (30.8%) subjects were alive, however, did not agree to be re-examined. In 
multivariate regression analysis, mortality was signiﬁcantly associated with the 
systemic parameters of older age (p < 0.001; Odds ratio (OR): 1.07; 95% 
conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.05, 1.09), male gender (p < 0.001; OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 
0.40, 0.78), lower level of education (p < 0.001; OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.74) 
and smoking (p < 0.001; OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.36, 2.49) and with the ocular 
parameters of presence of diabetic retinopathy (p = 0.002; OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 
1.34, 3.81), non-glaucomatous optic nerve damage (p = 0.001; OR: 4.90; 95% 
CI: 1.90, 12.7) and higher degree of nuclear cataract (p = 0.002; OR: 1.29; 95% 
CI: 1.10, 1.52). In that model, mortality was not signiﬁcantly (all p > 0.05) 
associated with refractive error, cortical or subcapsular posterior cataract, 
intraocular pressure, best corrected visual acuity, visual ﬁeld defects, prevalence 
of age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusions, open-angle glau- 
coma and angle-closure glaucoma. 
Conclusions: After adjustment for age, gender, level of education and smoking, 
mortality was signiﬁcantly higher in subjects with diabetic retinopathy, non- 
glaucomatous optic nerve damage and nuclear cataract. Other major ophthalmic 
parameters and disorders such as hyperopia, myopia, high myopia, pterygium, 
age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, glaucoma and cortical 
or nuclear cataract were not signiﬁcantly associated with mortality in the 
multivariate analysis.

Introduction 
In contrast 
to disorders of vitally 
important organs such as heart or 
brain, diseases of small organs like ears 
and eyes are not directly related to 
sudden death. This does not imply, 





however, that ocular diseases are not 
associated with an increased mortality 
in the long term. Knowledge about a 
potential association between eye dis- 
eases and increased mortality is essen- 
tial 
life-threatening 
conditions and to try to avoid the 
development of these. Previous studies 
have suggested that patients with glau- 
coma, 
retinal 
vein occlusions and low vision in gen- 
eral may have an increased mortality 
(Borger et al. 2003; Cheung et al. 2007; 
et al. 
Clemons 
2007a,b; Foong et al. 2008; Freeman 
et al. 2005; Hirai et al. 2007; Juutilai- 
nen et al. 2007; Klein et al. 1995; 
Knudtson et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2002, 
2006; McCarty et al. 2001; Mitchell 
et al. 2005; Ramrattan et al. 2001; 
Thiagarajan et al. 2005; Wang et al. 
2001, 2008; Wong et al. 2003, 2007; 
Wu et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2007, 2009). 
Most of these studies were focused, 
however, on one ocular disease only; 
other potentially confounding factors 
socio-economic parameters 
such as 
were mostly not taken into account, 
and the follow-up period was relatively 
short. We therefore conducted a pop- 
ulation-based study with a 10-year 
follow-up on subjects comprehensively 
examined for ocular disorders at base- 
line to assess which ocular diseases may 
lead to an increased mortality. 
Methods 
The Beijing Eye Study is a population- 
based study in Northern China. It was 
carried out in four communities in the 
urban district of Haidian in the north 
of Central Beijing 
and in three 
communities in the village area of Yufa 




of the Daxing District south of Beijing. 
The study has been described in detail 
recently (Jonas et al. 2009; Xu et al. 
2006; Xu et al. 2008). The Medical 
Ethics Committee of the Beijing Ton- 
gren Hospital approved the study pro- 
tocol, 
gave 
informed consent according to the 
Declaration of Helsinki. At the time 
of the ﬁrst survey in the year 2001, the 
seven communities had a total popula- 
tion of 5324 individuals aged 40 years 
or older. In total, 4439 individuals 
(2505 women) participated in the eye 
examination corresponding to an over- 
all response rate of 83.4%. The study 
was divided into a rural part (1973 
subjects; 1143 women) and an urban 
part (2466 subjects; 1362 women). The 
mean age was 56.2 (cid:1) 10.6 years (med- 
ian: 56 years; range: 40–101 years). In 
the year 2011, the study was repeated 
by reinviting all participants from the 
survey from 2001 to be re-examined. 
Information about being alive or dead 
of subjects, who participated in the 
baseline survey in 2001 but did not 
participate in the follow-up examina- 
tion in 2011, was obtained by house 
visits, by phone, by asking neighbours 
and by contacting the local municipal 
authorities. 
All examinations were carried out in 
the communities, either 
in school- 
houses or in community houses. At 
the baseline 
examination in 2001, 
trained research technicians asked the 
study participants questions from a 
standard 
providing 
questionnaire 
information on demographic variables 
such as age, gender, known diagnosis 
and current treatment of arterial hyper- 
tension, arterial hypotension, diabetes 
mellitus, 
thyroid disorders, cerebral 
haemorrhages, coronary heart diseases 
and hyperlipidemia. The socio-eco- 
nomic status was assessed with ques- 
tions 
education, 
occupation and family income. The 
level of education was categorized into 
the stages of ‘illiteracy’, ‘half illiteracy 
with knowledge of 
some Chinese 
words’, 
‘primary school education’, 
‘middle school education’ and ‘college 
or higher education’. Individuals were 
classiﬁed as self-reported non-smokers 
or 
smokers. 
Uncorrected visual acuity was mea- 
sured (Snellen charts) in a distance of 
5 m. Automatic refractometry (Auto 
Refractometer AR-610, Nidek Co., 
Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was performed if 





uncorrected visual acuity was lower 
than 1.0. Visual ﬁeld examinations 
were performed by frequency-doubling 
perimetry using the screening program 
C-20-1 (Zeiss-Humphrey, Dublin, Cal- 
ifornia, USA). 
Intraocular pressure 
was measured using a non-contact 
pneumotonometer (CT-60 computer- 
ized tonometer, Topcon Ltd., Japan). 
A slit-lamp examination was carried 
out by an ophthalmologist, and the 
anterior chamber depth was assessed 
using 
van Herick’s method (Van 
Herick et al. 1969). The pupil was 
dilated using tropicamide once or 
twice, until the pupil diameter was at 
least 6 mm. Digital photographs of the 
cornea and retro-illuminated photo- 
graphs of the lens were taken using 
the Neitz CT-R camera (Neitz Instru- 
ments Co., Tokyo, Japan). Colour 
photographs (on ﬁlm) of the macula 
and optic disc were taken using a 
fundus 
camera (Type CR6-45NM, 
Canon Inc. USA). Using the ﬁndings 
obtained during the clinical examina- 
tion and the results of the assessment of 
the photographs, we checked for tra- 
choma, pterygium, nuclear, cortical 
subcapsular cataract, 
and posterior 
glaucoma, 
optic 
nerve damage, age-related macular 
degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, ret- 
inal vein occlusions and any other 
haemorrhagic retinopathy (Xu et al. 
2009). On the optic disc photographs, 
we additionally measured size of the 
optic disc, neuroretinal rim, optic cup 
and beta zone of parapapillary atrophy 
and the diameter of the retinal arteries 
and veins in the four vessel branches. 
For the evaluation of the retinal micro- 
vascular abnormalities, focal narrow- 
ing of arterioles, generalized narrowing 
of arterioles, sheathing of arterioles 
and arteriovenous crossing abnormali- 
ties 
nicking) were 
assessed. The retinal vascular abnor- 
malities including focal narrowing of 
arterioles and arteriovenous crossing 
abnormalities (arteriovenous nicking) 
were assessed using the protocol of the 
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities 
Study. 


Statistical analysis was performed 
using a commercially available statisti- 
cal software package (SPSS for Win- 
dows, version 20.0, IBM-SPSS Inc. 
Chicago, IL, USA). Only one eye per 
subject was taken for statistical analy- 
sis to avoid a statistical bias. The eye 
with the more severe degree of the 

disease was chosen for the statistical 
analysis. Continuous data were pre- 
sented as mean (cid:1) standard deviation. 
Logistic regression models were used 
associations of 
the 
to investigate 
mortality with systemic parameters 
such as age and level of education, 
and ocular parameters such as reti- 
nal microvascular abnormalities. All 
parameters used in the statistical analy- 
sis were assessed at the baseline exam- 
ination in 2001. In a ﬁrst step of the 
statistical analysis, we assessed associ- 
ations between mortality and systemic 
or ocular parameters after adjusting for 
age, as mortality was highly signiﬁ- 
cantly associated with higher age. In a 
second step, we carried out a multivar- 
iate analysis with mortality as depen- 
dent parameter and all parameters as 
independent parameters, for which the 
p-value of their association with mor- 
tality was ≤0.10 after adjusting for age. 
We then dropped those variables from 
independent parameters 
the list of 
which were no longer 
signiﬁcantly 
associated with mortality in the multi- 
variate analysis, starting with the vari- 
ables with the highest p-values. Odds 
ratios (OR) were presented, and their 
95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) were 
described. All p-values were two-sided 
and considered statistically signiﬁcant 
when less than 0.05. 
Results 
Of the 4439 subjects examined in the 
2001, 2695 (60.7%) subjects returned 
for the follow-up examination, while 
379 (8.5%) subjects were dead and 
1365 (30.8%) subjects were alive, how- 
ever, did not agree to be re-examined. 
The prevalence and means of the basic 
parameters as measured in 2001 are 
presented in Table 1. 
Mortality was highly signiﬁcantly 
associated with higher age (p < 0.001; 
OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.13). As ﬁrst 
the statistical analysis, we 
step of 
therefore adjusted mortality for age 
and searched for associations with 
additional parameters. It revealed that 
mortality adjusted for age was signiﬁ- 
cantly correlated with the systemic 
gender 
parameters

(p < 0.001), 
income 
family 
(p < 0.001), 
lower level of education

As second step of 
the statistical 
analysis, we carried out a multivariate 
analysis as described above. Step by 
step, we dropped from the list of 
independent variables the parameters 
of generalized vessel narrowing, peri- 
metric score, best corrected visual acu- 
ity, prevalence of pterygium, temporal 
subcapsular 
inferior vein diameter, 
posterior cataract, disc area, neuroreti- 
nal rim area, prevalence of open-angle 
glaucoma and prevalence of angle-clo- 
sure glaucoma. We ﬁnally arrived at a 
model in which mortality was signiﬁ- 
cantly 
age 
associated with older 
(p < 0.001), male gender (p < 0.001), 
lower level of education (p < 0.001), 
former or ever smoking (p < 0.001), 
presence 
retinopathy 
diabetic 
(p = 0.002), presence of non-glaucoma- 
tous optic nerve damage (p = 0.001) 
and higher degree of nuclear cataract 
(p = 0.002). 

Discussion 
In our 10-year population-based fol- 
low-up study, mortality was signiﬁ- 
cantly associated with the presence of 
diabetic retinopathy, presence of non- 
glaucomatous optic nerve damage and 
cataract 
more pronounced nuclear 
after adjusting for the systemic param- 
eters of older age, male gender, lower 
level of education and smoking. In this 
multivariate model, mortality was not 
signiﬁcantly (all p > 0.05) associated 
with other major ophthalmic parame- 
ters and disorders such as hyperopia, 
myopia, high myopia, pterygium, age- 
related macular degeneration, retinal 
vein occlusion, glaucoma and cortical 
or subcapsular posterior cataract. 
With respect to the systemic factors 
of age, male gender, smoking and 
lower socio-economic status as mea- 
sured by the level of education, the 
ﬁndings of our study conﬁrm previous 
investigations in which these systemic 
parameters were signiﬁcantly associ- 
ated with mortality. With respect to 
diabetic retinopathy, our study con- 
ﬁrms previous population-based stud- 
ies such as the Blue Mountains Eye 
Study and the Beaver Dam Study on 
other ethnic groups in which diabetic 
retinopathy was correlated with an 
increased risk of mortality (Cugati 
et al. 2007a). 
A factor added to the list of ocular 
factors associated with mortality was 
the presence of non-glaucomatous 
optic nerve damage. In the multivariate 
analysis, subjects with non-glaucoma- 
tous optic nerve damage had a higher 
mortality than those with a healthy 
appearance of the optic nerve head on 
the optic disc photographs. Reason for 
the association may be the various 
causes 
for non-glaucomatous optic 
nerve atrophy such as retinal micro- 
infarcts in the retinal nerve ﬁbre layer, 
temporary retinal arterial occlusions 
and neurological disorders. 
It may 
indicate that clinically the ophthalmo- 
scopic visibility of the retinal nerve 
ﬁbre layer, the thickness of the retinal 
nerve ﬁbre layer as measured by optical 
coherence tomography and the pallor 
of the neuroretinal in the optic nerve 
head may be taken as hints for the 
general condition of the subject. 
The results of our 10-year follow-up 
study mostly agree with the ﬁndings 
obtained in the previous 5-year follow- 
up study of the Beijing Eye Study 2001/ 
2006 with respect to the association 
between an increased mortality and the 
presence of diabetic retinopathy and of 
non-glaucomatous optic nerve damage. 
In previous hospital-based studies and 
investigations with a shorter follow-up, 
it has remained unclear so far whether 
the presence of open-angle glaucoma is 
a risk factor for mortality. In our study 
population, after adjusting for age, the 
presence open-angle glaucoma was sig- 
niﬁcantly (p = 0.003) associated with 
higher mortality, while the prevalence 
of angle-closure glaucoma showed a 
tendency (p = 0.06) of an association. 
If, however, an additional adjustment 
for the systemic risk factors of male 
gender, 
level and 
smoking was carried out, neither the 
presence of open-angle glaucoma nor 
of angle-closure glaucoma were factors 
associated with 
higher mortality 
(Table 2). One may argue that glau- 
coma-related defects in the visual ﬁeld 
may increase the risk of accidents as 
has also been shown in the Rotterdam 
study (Ramrattan et al. 2001). Inter- 
estingly, 
increased mortality was sig- 
niﬁcantly associated with a decreased 
best corrected visual acuity (p < 0.001) 
and increased visual ﬁeld defects 
(p < 0.001) after adjusting for age in 
our study (Table 1). 



In contrast to the 5-year follow-up of 
the Beijing Eye Study and in contrast to 
other studies (Cugati et al. 2007a; Xu 
et al. 2009), retinal vein occlusions were 
associated with 
not 
increased mortality in the multivariate 
analysis in our study population. The 
reason for the diﬀerence in this ﬁnding 
between the studies has remained elu- 
sive. The 10-year mortality rate of 8.5% 
in our present study agrees well with the 
mortality of 3.2% of the same popula- 
tion within a 5-year follow-up period 
(Xu et al. 2009). 
There are limitations of the present 
study. First, as in any population-based 
study, non-participation can be of major 
concern. In the Beijing Eye Study, at the 
time of the survey in the year 2001, 4439 
individuals of 5324 invited individuals 
participated in the study, resulting in a 
participation rate of 83.4%. Of these 
4439 subjects, 2695 subjects or 60.7% of 
the participants of 2001 returned for the 
re-examination in the year 2011, while 
379 (8.5%) subjects were dead, and 1365 
(30.8%) subjects were alive, however, did 
not agree to be re-examined. The 
decreased rate of participation may, 
however, not have inﬂuenced the con- 
clusions of our study as one knew 
whether the non-participating subjects 
were dead or alive. Second, blood 
pressure measurements, blood sample 
examinations for lipids and glycosylated 
haemoglobin and measurements of body 
height, weight and body mass index were 
not performed at baseline in 2001, so that 
the multivariate analysis did not include 
arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia 
as risk factors for an increased mortality. 
Third, the elderly population from China 
has a markedly diﬀerent history and had 
profoundly diﬀerent living conditions in 
previous years than elderly populations 
in Western countries, so that it is unclear 
how far the results of our study can be 
transferred to other population and 
societies. Fourth, there was no reliable 
information on the cause of death for all 
people who had died, so that associations 
between the cause of death and pre- 
existing ocular or systemic diseases or 
ocular parameters could not be assessed. 
In conclusion, after adjustment for 
level of education and 
age, gender, 
smoking, mortality was 
signiﬁcantly 
higher in subjects with diabetic retinop- 
athy, non-glaucomatous optic nerve 
damage and nuclear cataract. Other 
major ophthalmic parameters and disor- 
ders such as hyperopia, myopia, high

myopia, pterygium, age-related macular 
degeneration, 
retinal vein occlusion, 
glaucoma and cortical or nuclear cata- 
ract were not signiﬁcantly associated 
with mortality. These ﬁndings may have 
clinical importance as patients in whom 
one of the associated ocular conditions is 
detected may undergo an intensiﬁed 
general body examination to detect rea- 
sons for it to prevent early death. The 
ﬁndings may pathogenetically be inter- 
esting as the associations, and the lack of 
associations, between the ocular disor- 
ders and mortality may give some hints 
for their pathogenesis.
