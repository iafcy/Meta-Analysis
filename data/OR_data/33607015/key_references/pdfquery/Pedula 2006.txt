OBJECTIVES: To determine whether poorer visual acuity 
and contrast sensitivity are independent risk factors for 
all-cause and traumatic mortality in older women. 
DESIGN: Twelve-year prospective cohort study (1986–2003). 
SETTING: Four U.S. clinical centers. 
PARTICIPANTS: Nine thousand seven hundred four 
postmenopausal white women aged 65 and older. 
MEASUREMENTS: Habitually corrected binocular visual 
acuity and low- and high-frequency contrast sensitivity 
were measured at baseline using a standard protocol. A 
study physician adjudicated the primary cause of death 
from death certiﬁcates and medical record review. 
RESULTS: During an average of 12.2 years of follow- 
up, 3,427 women died (35%), 72 (0.7%) from traumatic 
events. In multivariate models adjusted for age, chronic 
medical problems, and smoking, all-cause mortality risk 
was 19% greater for persons in the worst quartile of visual 
acuity than for those in the best (hazard ratio (HR) 5 1.19, 
P 5.008) and 39% greater for persons with the worst 
contrast sensitivity (HR 5 1.39, Po.001) than for those 
with the best. Traumatic mortality risk was 2.4 times greater 
for women with the worst contrast sensitivity than for those 
with the best (HR 5 2.44, P 5.03). 
CONCLUSION: Poorer visual acuity and contrast sensi- 
tivity are associated with greater risk of traumatic and all- 
cause mortality in older women, even after controlling for 
demographic and clinical characteristics. Although further 
research is necessary to determine how treating reversible 
causes of visual impairment or improving current refraction 
affects mortality in older women, clinical detection and 
follow-up of these visual impairments holds promise for

Key words: mortality; visual acuity; contrast sensitivity 

tions affecting older individuals. Approximately 92% 
of persons aged 70 and older require corrective lenses, and 
2% are legally blind without correction.1 Additionally, 
14% of persons aged 70 to 74 and 32% of persons aged 85 
and older report trouble seeing even while wearing glasses.1 
Visual impairment likely reﬂects biological aging and 
disease processes, and its health effect is substantial. Im- 
paired vision increases the risk of falls, hip fractures,2–8 and 
decline in functional status.9–13 Although previous studies 
have demonstrated a relationship between sensory impair- 
ment and quality of life, they conﬂict on its relationship 
with mortality.14–24 Cross-sectional design, small study 
sample, 
impairment, and limited 
adjustment for the independent inﬂuence of other chronic 
medical conditions have limited prior studies. 

It was hypothesized that any association between visual 
impairment and all-cause mortality is likely a consequence 
of other comorbidities related to vision and mortality. It 
was also hypothesized that, after adjustment for these med- 
ical conditions, visual impairment would not be related to 
total mortality. Nevertheless, it was theorized that visual 
impairment is independently associated with traumatic 
events and would remain predictive of traumatic mortality 
even after adjustment for other risk factors. This longitu- 
dinal study attempts to address these hypotheses by evalu- 
ating the relationship of visual acuity and contrast 
sensitivity to all-cause and traumatic mortality in a 
population of older women. 

Research Setting and Study Population 
The Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) is a multicenter 
study of elderly women recruited to identify risk factors for 
osteoporotic fractures and other health outcomes irrespect-

ive of osteoporosis status. The sample consisted of 9,704 
ambulatory white women aged 65 and older recruited from 
1986 to 1988 in four metropolitan areas of the United 
States: Portland, Oregon; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Balti- 
more, Maryland; and the Monongahela Valley, Pennsylva- 
nia. Details of 
the study design have been reported 
elsewhere.2 All participants received a standardized inter- 
view and clinical examination approximately every 2 years 
after baseline, covering multiple domains of health, poten- 
tial lifestyle and dietary risk factors for falls and fractures, 
and sociodemographic characteristics. The institutional 
review boards at each site approved the study, and all the 
women provided written informed consent. 
Measurements 
Visual Acuity and Contrast Sensitivity 
Visual acuity was assessed at baseline for all participants 
using a standard protocol with trained examiners. Subjects 
were asked to read the Bailey-Lovie letter chart with both 
eyes open, wearing their current spectacle correction if they 
usually wore glasses for distance.25 Results of this visual 
acuity testing were expressed as current binocular vision. 
For analytical purposes, the log minimum angle of reso- 
lution (logMAR) visual acuity25 was evaluated as quartiles 
of increased impairment. 
Pelli-Robson letter charts were used to measure 
binocular contrast sensitivity (the ability to detect subtle 
differences between objects that are not black and white).26 
Log contrast sensitivity scores were calculated for low and 
high spatial frequencies (i.e., fat gratings and thin gratings) 
normalized to the median of the study population and then 
averaged across all spatial frequencies. Thus a score of 1.0 
indicates a contrast sensitivity equivalent to the median for 
the study population. Scores greater than 1.0 indicate a 
level of contrast sensitivity better than the population 
median. For analytical purposes, this average was then 
evaluated as quartiles of decreasing contrast sensitivity. 
Mortality 
From 1986 to 2003, participants or designated proxies were 
contacted by mail or telephone every 4 months for out- 
comes and to verify vital status (495% complete). Death 
certiﬁcates were physician-adjudicated to determine the 
primary cause of death, using codes from the International 
Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modiﬁcation (ICD-9-CM). Traumatic deaths were deﬁned 
as ICD-9-CM codes 800 to 995. 
Other Measurements 
Demographic characteristics, self-reported health status, 
history of medical conditions, falls, and smoking status 
were obtained via a questionnaire reviewed by trained in- 
terviewers. For medical conditions 
such as diabetes 
mellitus, stroke, and cataract, the subject was asked if a 
doctor had ever told her that she had the condition. Med- 
ication use was determined according to questionnaire 
and from the pill bottles that participants brought to the 
examination. 
Weight and height (using a stadiometer) and knee 
height were measured. Body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) was 
calculated with knee height substituted for total height, 
because knee height is less likely to change with age. 
Hypertension was deﬁned as having measured blood pres- 
sure greater than 160/90 mmHg or taking thiazide diuretics. 
Frailty measures included whether the subject could rise 
from a chair (without using her arms) ﬁve times and 
whether the subject was resting (off her feet) more than 4 
hours per day. Functional disability was based on partic- 
ipants’ ability to perform six activities: walking, climbing 
stairs, descending stairs, preparing meals, shopping, and 
doing housework.27,28 
Statistical Methods 
Binocular visual acuity was analyzed in three ways: as a 
continuous variable using the logMAR score, as a Snellen 
equivalent of 20/40 or worse, and in quartiles based on the 
logMAR score. Binocular contrast sensitivity was analyzed 
as a continuous measure using the average normalized score 
across high and low spatial frequencies and as a categorical 
variable using quartiles of contrast sensitivity. Contrast 
sensitivity was averaged across low and high spatial fre- 
quencies, because the low-frequency contrast sensitivity, 
high-frequency 
combined- 
frequency contrast sensitivity exhibited similar associations 
with mortality. However, the combined frequency associ- 
ation was the largest and had the greatest level of statistical 
significance. 



Baseline attributes were compared across quartiles of 
visual acuity and contrast sensitivity using the Mantel- 
Haenszel chi-square test 
for trend. Cox proportional 
hazards analyses were used to evaluate the independent 
contribution of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity to 
mortality, adjusted ﬁrst for age only and then multivariate 
for other signiﬁcant (Po.05) risk factors. Covariates tested 
in the multivariate analyses were those found to be asso- 
ciated with mortality in prior SOF analyses and included 
age; BMI; mean pulse; pack-years smoked; currently living 
alone; use of thiazide diuretics, nonthiazide diuretics, and 
estrogen; history of diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, 
hypertension, stroke, and cataract; having fallen in past 
year; number of falls in past year; self-reported health sta- 
tus; history of fracture after age 50; education; functional 
disability; resting off feet more than 4 hours per day; and 
requiring use of arms to stand from a chair. When contrast 
sensitivity and visual acuity were both independent predic- 
tors of mortality, hazard ratios for each were adjusted for 
the other. 
Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% conﬁdence 
intervals (CIs) are based on the adjusted analysis. All stat- 
istical analyses were conducted using SAS version 6.12 (SAS 
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). All reported statistical tests are 
two-sided, and the term ‘‘statistically signiﬁcant’’ implies 
Po.05. For ease of interpretation, there was no adjustment 
for multiple comparisons. 
RESULTS 
Women in this cohort had average age of 71.7 (cid:1) 5.3 and a 
mean BMI of 26.5 (cid:1) 4.7 kg/m2. A total of 682 (7.0%) 
reported a history of diabetes mellitus, 292 (3.0%) a history 
of stroke, and 3,747 (38.9%) had hypertension. Forty-one 
percent reported estrogen use (ever/current) and 35% 
thiazide diuretic use. Thirty-nine percent reported past or 
current smoking; 62% of these reported having smoked 15

pack-years or more. A total of 8,070 (83%) reported being 
in good to excellent (as opposed to fair to poor) health, and 
42% were currently living alone. Thirty-seven percent re- 
ported at least one functional impairment, whereas 6.5% 
had four or more. Approximately 10% of women were off 
their feet for 4 or more hours per day, 4.2% required the use 
of their arms to stand from a chair, and 30.1% had fallen 
within the previous 12 months. 
Overall, average logMAR binocular visual acuity was 
0.12 (cid:1) 0.15 and ranged from –0.28 to 1.40. This is ap- 
proximately equivalent to 20/25 (range 20/12–20/500) on 
the Snellen scale.29 Eight percent of subjects had currently 
corrected binocular visual acuity of 20/40 or worse. Less 
than 1% of participants had a logMAR of 1.0 or greater, 
commonly considered legal blindness (Snellen visual acuity 
20/200 or worse).30 Mean binocular normalized contrast 
sensitivity was 1.27 (cid:1) 0.75 (range 0–4.96). Thus, the aver- 
age normalized contrast sensitivity across all spatial fre- 
quencies was 27% higher than the population median. 
During a mean follow-up of 12.2 years, 3,427 women 
(35.3%) died. Of these deaths, 1,264 (36.9%) were due to 
cardiovascular disease, 852 (24.9%) to cancer, 368 (10.7%) 
to stroke, 296 (8.6%) to respiratory diseases, 169 (4.9%) to 
mental diseases, 89 (2.6%) to digestive diseases, and 82 
(2.4%) to genitourinary diseases. Trauma caused 72 deaths 
(2.1%); no other category of death accounted for more than 
2%. The most common causes of traumatic death were 
motor vehicle accidents (n 5 21); sequelae of hip, vertebra, 
or skull fractures (n 5 18); lethal hemorrhage from the 
trauma (n 5 10); complications of falls (n 5 5); and other 
causes from other injuries (n 5 5). 
Table 1 shows that persons with poorer visual acuity 
and poorer contrast sensitivity were at higher risk of all- 
cause mortality and, in particular, deaths due to trauma. 
All-cause mortality rates (per 100,000 person-years) ranged 
from 1,816 for persons with the best baseline binocular 
visual acuity to 4,715 for persons with the poorest visual 
acuity. Similar rates were seen for contrast sensitivity, with 
an all-cause mortality rate ranging from 1,648 per 100,000 
person-years for persons with the best binocular contrast 
sensitivity to 4,942 for persons with the poorest contrast 
sensitivity. Traumatic mortality rates were about three times 
higher for persons in the poorest visual acuity (108 per 
100,000) and contrast sensitivity (113 per 100,000) quar- 
tiles than for those in the best visual acuity (37 per 100,000) 
and contrast sensitivity (31 per 100,000) quartiles. 
Average logMAR visual acuity (cid:1) standard deviation in 
survivors was 0.09 (cid:1) 0.13, compared with 0.16 (cid:1) 0.17 in 
those who died from any cause (Po.001) and 0.14 (cid:1) 0.14 
in those who died from trauma (P 5.002). Average contrast 
sensitivity in the surviving group was 1.40 (cid:1) 0.75, 
compared with 1.02 (cid:1) 0.67 in those who died from any 
cause (Po.001) and 1.03 (cid:1) 0.62 in those who died from 
trauma (Po.001). Of deaths due to all causes, 431 (12.6%) 
persons had a visual acuity of 20/40 or worse at baseline, 
compared with 358 (5.7%) survivors (Po.001). Eight in- 
dividuals (11.1%) who died from trauma had visual acuity 
of 20/40 or worse (P 5.07 compared with survivors). 
In age-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, log- 
MAR visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were associated 
with all-cause mortality (Table 2). Relative to the ﬁrst (best) 
quartile of visual acuity, each of the second, third, and 
fourth quartiles showed signiﬁcantly greater risks of 
all-cause mortality. A similar association was seen between 
contrast sensitivity and all-cause mortality (Table 2).

In addition to age, other risk factors that were inde- 
pendently predictive of all-cause mortality included BMI; 
pulse; pack-years smoked; living alone; history of diabetes 
mellitus, hyperthyroidism, stroke, or hypertension; use of 
nonthiazide diuretics; no estrogen use; history of falls; 
functional disability; poorer self-reported health status; off 
feet 4 or more hours per day; and required use of arms to 
stand from chair. After adjustment for these, binocular

(cid:1) All-cause mortality models were adjusted for age, body mass index, pulse, pack-years smoked, living alone, history of diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, stroke, 
hypertension, use of non-thiazide diuretics, estrogen use, history of falls, self-reported health status, functional impairment, off feet 4 hours or more per day, and 
required use of arms to stand from chair. The model with LogMAR visual acuity was also adjusted for contrast sensitivity, and the model with contrast sensitivity was 
adjusted for LogMAR visual acuity. 
w 
Traumatic mortality models were adjusted for age, body mass index, stroke, pulse, self-reported health status and hypertension. A small number of traumatic events 
and correlation between LogMAR visual acuity and contrast sensitivity (correlation coefﬁcient 5 0.65) prevented simultaneous inclusion of both terms in the 
traumatic mortality model. Thus, the traumatic mortality models do not include adjustment for the other visual impairment measure. 
logMAR visual acuity and contrast sensitivity remained 
signiﬁcant predictors of all-cause mortality, although only 
the fourth quartile of logMAR visual acuity and the third 
and fourth quartiles of contrast sensitivity remained 
signiﬁcantly different from the ﬁrst (best) quartile of the 
respective measure (Table 2). 
Figure 1 displays the adjusted all-cause mortality curves 
for each of the four quartiles of visual acuity (A) and contrast 
sensitivity (B). This ﬁgure suggests that visual impairment is 
associated with both short-term and long-term mortality. In 
separate analyses, women in quartiles 3 and 4 of logMAR 
visual acuity and contrast sensitivity demonstrated signiﬁ- 
cantly higher mortality risk (Po.05) than those in quartile 1 
as soon as 3 years of follow-up (data not shown). 
In age-adjusted analyses modeling traumatic mortality 
(Table 2), only the fourth quartile of impairment was sig- 
niﬁcantly associated with greater risk of traumatic mortal- 
ity (HR 5 2.23, 95% CI 5 1.16–4.75 for logMAR visual 
acuity and HR 5 2.86, 95% CI 5 1.32–6.20 for contrast 
sensitivity). After multivariate adjustment for age, BMI, 
stroke, pulse, self-reported health status, and hypertension, 
persons with the worst contrast sensitivity had 2.45 times as 
great a risk of traumatic mortality as those with the best 
contrast sensitivity (95% CI 5 1.12–5.30). Because of the 
correlation between contrast sensitivity and logMAR visual 
acuity (r 5 0.65), and the relatively small number of trau- 
matic deaths, both visual impairment terms could not be 
included in the same model. Nevertheless, when contrast 
sensitivity was not included in the model, persons with the 
worst logMAR visual acuity had a 39% greater risk of 
traumatic mortality than those with the best visual acuity 
(HR 5 1.39, 95% CI 5 1.01–4.12). 
Figure 2 displays the adjusted traumatic mortality 
curves for each of the four quartiles of visual acuity (A) and 
contrast sensitivity (B). Although the worst quartile of log- 
MAR visual acuity and contrast sensitivity exhibited a 
greater risk of mortality than the other quartiles, 10 years of 
follow-up was required before the association with contrast 
sensitivity was signiﬁcant. The entire follow-up period was 
required to detect a greater risk of traumatic mortality for 
persons in the fourth quartile of logMAR visual acuity than 
for those in the ﬁrst quartile. 
DISCUSSION 
This population-based longitudinal study of older post- 
menopausal women showed that poorer visual acuity and 
contrast sensitivity were independent predictors of all-cause 
mortality. The risk of all-cause mortality over a 12.2-year 
interval was 19% greater for persons with the worst

to (A) logMAR visual acuity and (B) contrast sensitivity quar-

hazards model and adjusted for age; body mass index; pulse; 
pack-years smoked; living alone; history of diabetes mellitus, 
hyperthyroidism, stroke, and hypertension; use of nonthiazide 
diuretics; estrogen use; history of falls; self-reported health sta- 
tus; functional impairment; off feet for 4 or more hours per day;

logMAR visual acuity than for those with the best. Women 
with contrast sensitivity in the third and fourth quartiles 
had 23% and 39% greater risks, respectively, of all-cause 
mortality than women with the best contrast sensitivity. In 
addition, the risk of traumatic mortality was 2.44 times 
as great for persons in the worst quartile for contrast 
sensitivity as for those in the best quartile. 
Relationships between visual impairment and morta- 
lity have been noted in other studies.19–22,24,31 The Beaver 
Dam Eye Study found that, although persons with visual 
acuity of 20/40 or worse were 1.6 times as likely to die 
within 5 years as those with better visual acuity, the 
relationship disappeared after adjusting for other clinical 
conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus.17 
A similar relationship remained signiﬁcant even after 
adjustment in the Melbourne Visual Impairment Project.18 
In some studies, longer follow-up was necessary to detect 
associations, indicating that the effect might be indirect and 
mediated by other factors. However, the current study 
found signiﬁcant associations of visual acuity and contrast 
sensitivity to all-cause mortality within 3 years of follow- 
up, suggesting that visual impairment is associated with 
short-term and long-term mortality. 
Figure 2. Adjusted traumatic mortality probabilities according 
to (A) logMAR visual acuity and (B) contrast sensitivity quar- 
tiles. Probabilities were calculated from Cox proportional 
hazards model and adjusted for age, body mass index, stroke, 
pulse, self-reported health status, and hypertension. 
The relationship between visual impairment and all-cause 
mortality did not support the a priori hypothesis that this 
association would disappear after adjustment for other covar- 
iates. It may be that visual impairment is indeed an independ- 
ent predictor of all-cause mortality, in which case there may be 
opportunities to reduce death risk with interventions as simple 
as refraction improvement. However, it is possible that the 
association that was found was due to the presence of other 
unmeasured chronic medical conditions. Leading causes of 
visual 
impairment include glaucoma, age-related cataract, 
macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy.1 Underlying 
conditions that are associated with these eye diseases (e.g., 
hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and aging) are also 
commonly associated with greater mortality.19,20,23,32 In this 
study, every attempt was made to adjust for known confound- 
ers. Hypertension, tobacco use, and diabetes mellitus were all 
independent predictors of all-cause mortality. A history of age- 
related cataracts was signiﬁcantly associated with mortality in 
the unadjusted analyses but did not remain signiﬁcant after 
adjustment. Information was unavailable about glaucoma or 
macular degeneration at the baseline examination, so adjust- 
ment for these conditions was not possible. However, these 
diseases were not found to be related to worse survival in other 
studies.17,22 Still, it is possible that visual impairment is a 
marker for other systemic conditions related to mortality that 
were not measured precisely (e.g., severity of diabetes mellitus). 
When contrast sensitivity was included in the model, 
the association between logMAR visual acuity and 




traumatic mortality was no longer signiﬁcant. Other studies 
have also failed to detect an independent relationship 
between visual acuity and traumatic mortality.18,33 The 
visual acuity assessment in the current study was measured 
using both eyes and with current correction. Other studies 
suggest that monocular impaired vision causes greater 
loss of stereopsis than binocular impairment and that 
monocular impaired vision is more strongly predictive of 
hip fracture,3,34,35 yet in persons with age-related macular 
degeneration, monocular vision has been shown to provide 
better visual function than binocular vision, especially at 
medium to low spatial frequencies.36 It is not clear which 
method of assessing visual acuity is most valid when evalu- 
ating nonophthalmic outcomes. Testing both eyes together 
and using the participant’s current correction attempted to 
obtain the most accurate measure of the individual’s every- 
day functional acuity. It is possible that the results would be 
different had best-corrected visual acuity in the better (or 
worse) eye or some other measure of visual acuity been 
used. It is also possible that, with the small number of 
traumatic deaths, the correlation between logMAR visual 
acuity and contrast sensitivity (correlation coefﬁcient 5 
0.65) was such that logMAR visual acuity did not add sig- 
niﬁcantly to the prediction model. 
Poor contrast sensitivity has been linked to accidents, 
self-reported limitation of night-time driving, and falls and 
fractures.37–39 The results of the current study relating 
poorer contrast sensitivity to deaths that follow these types 
of events amplify the importance of identifying contrast 
sensitivity as a risk factor, especially because evidence sug- 
gests that improvement in visual functioning can positively 
affect quality of life and reduce accidents.40 
Strengths of this study include the long follow-up and 
low attrition of this cohort, although because this study 
consisted of community-dwelling elderly white women, 
relationships may differ for men, frailer or younger women, 
or women from other racial or ethnic groups. Furthermore, 
although other clinical characteristics known to be related 
to mortality were controlled for, it is possible that other 
unmeasured factors may have modiﬁed the results. 

In conclusion, it was found that women with poorer 
visual acuity using current correction and those with poorer 
contrast sensitivity were at greater risk of mortality; this 
association remained despite 
several 
potential confounders including health status and medical 
comorbidities. It is not clear that decreasing visual impair- 
ment would reduce mortality, but if improvement in visual 
function reduces accidents and falls, then mortality result- 
ing from these traumatic events could also decrease. In 
addition, clinically identifying persons with poor visual 
acuity and contrast sensitivity may help to identify those 
with underlying conditions that, when treated, could reduce 
all-cause mortality.
