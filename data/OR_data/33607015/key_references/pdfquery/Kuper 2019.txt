Objective To estimate the association between (1) visual 
impairment (VI) and (2) eye disease and 6-year mortality 
risk within a cohort of elderly Kenyan people. 
Design, setting and participants The baseline of the 
Nakuru Posterior Segment Eye Disease Study was formed 
from a population-based survey of 4318 participants 
aged ≥50 years, enrolled in 2007–2008. Ophthalmic 
and anthropometric examinations were undertaken on 
all participants at baseline, and a questionnaire was 
administered, including medical and ophthalmic history. 
Participants were retraced in 2013–2014 for a second 
examination. Vital status was recorded for all participants 
through information from community members. 
Cumulative incidence of mortality, and its relationship 
with baseline VI and types of eye disease was estimated. 
Inverse probability weighting was used to adjust for non- 
participation. 
Primary outcome measures Cumulative incidence of 
mortality in relation to VI level at baseline. 
results Of the baseline sample, 2170 (50%) were 
re-examined at follow-up and 407 (10%) were known 
to have died (adjusted risk of 11.9% over 6 years). 
Compared to those with normal vision (visual acuity (VA) 
≥6/12, risk=9.7%), the 6-year mortality risk was higher 
among people with VI (<6/18 to ≥6/60; risk=28.3%; risk 
ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.40) or severe VI (SVI)/ 
blindness (<6/60; risk=34.9%; RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.04 to 
3.80). These associations remained after adjustment for 
non-communicable disease (NCD) risk factors (mortality: 
RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.15; SVI/blind: RR 1.46, 95% 
CI 0.80 to 2.68). Mortality risk was also associated with 
presence of diabetic retinopathy at baseline (RR 3.18, 
95% CI 1.98 to 5.09), cataract (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 
1.66) and presence of both cataract and VI (RR 1.57, 95% 
CI 1.24 to 1.98). Mortality risk was higher among people 
with age-related macular degeneration at baseline (with 
or without VI), compared with those without (RR 1.42, 
95% CI 0.91 to 2.22 and RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.81, 
respectively). 
Conclusions Visual acuity was related to 6-year mortality 
risk in this cohort of elderly Kenyan people, potentially 
because both VI and mortality are related to ageing and 
risk factors for NCD. 
IntrODuCtIOn 
Visual impairment (VI) is common, affecting 
approximately 253 million people globally.1 
It can impact on different aspects of people’s 
lives, including reducing quality of life, 
and increasing poverty and depression.2–5 
There is growing evidence from Europe, 
North America, Asia and Australia that VI 
and specific eye conditions are linked to 
increased risk of mortality,6–17 but data are 
lacking for low-income and middle-income 
countries (LMICs), particularly from sub-Sa- 
haran Africa. 
There are several potential pathways by 
which VI may be linked with mortality. Both 
VI and mortality are related to ageing, and so 
confounding or residual confounding may 
explain the reported associations. There are 
also common underlying risk factors for both 
VI and mortality, such as smoking, obesity 
and poverty. For instance, VI due to age-re- 
lated macular degeneration (AMD) is more 





 ► The cohort comprised a representative popula- 
tion-based sample in an area of ethnic, socioeco- 
nomic and educational diversity. 
 ► There was a comprehensive assessment of ophthal- 
mic characteristics and risk factors at baseline and 
follow-up. 




common among smokers,18 and smoking increases risk 
of mortality. An underlying disease may also cause both 
VI and mortality, for instance, diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
is related to poor control of diabetes, which also causes 
increased mortality. People with VI may find it more 
difficult to seek healthcare, due to a range of barriers,19 
thereby increasing their mortality risk. Changes in the 
eye may be a marker of ageing or accelerated ageing,20 
and thereby linked to mortality. Finally, VI could acerbate 
frailty, depression and functional difficulties, all linked to 
increased mortality.3 21 22 
It is important to explore whether there is an associa- 
tion between VI and mortality and, if there is, to identify 
possible pathways for this link, in order to understand how 
to reduce the vulnerability of people with VI to increased 
morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, these data may be 
useful to advocate for scaling up of eye health services in 
LMICs. The objective of this study was to investigate the 
association between VI and 6-year mortality risk within 
the Nakuru Eye Disease Cohort Study, a cohort of elderly 
Kenyan people.

The methodology of the Nakuru Eye Disease Cohort 
Study has been reported previously,23 and is summarised 
here. 
baseline study population 
The baseline population-based survey was conducted in 
2007/2008. A total of 100 clusters each of 50 participants 
were selected with a probability proportional to the size 
of the population across Nakuru district. Households 
were selected within clusters using a modified compact 
segment sampling method.24 Eligible individuals were 
those aged ≥50 years living in the household for at least 
3 months in the previous year, and multiple subjects could 
be included per household. 
baseline ophthalmic and general examination 
All participants were invited to undergo a comprehen- 
sive ophthalmic examination at a screening clinic.23 The 
objectives of the survey and the examination process were 
explained to those eligible in the local dialect, in the 
presence of a witness. A subject was examined only after 
informed written (or thumbprint) consent was obtained. 
All participants underwent Logarithm of the Minimum 
Angle of Resolution (logMAR) visual acuity (VA) testing 
on each eye separately and corrected VA (by refrac- 
tion or pinhole) when less than 20/40 Snellen equiva- 
lent. Participants had two non-stereoscopic, digital, 45° 
fundus photographs (one disc and one macula centred) 
taken per eye by an ophthalmic clinical officer. Digital 
images were graded for the presence of AMD and DR 
at an approved grading centre (Moorfields Eye Hospital

by a clinician for confirmed cases and 5% of randomly 
selected images to ensure quality control. The presence 
of cataract was recorded by the ophthalmologist (WM) on 
slit-lamp examination after pupil dilation. 
Detailed interviews were undertaken in the local 
language on demographic details, information on risk 
factors, socioeconomic status (SES) and full medical 
history. 
A nurse performed and recorded measures of partici- 
pants: height (Leicester Height Measure); weight (Seca 
761) and three measures of blood pressure (Omron 
Digital Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor Model 
HEM907), each 10 min apart. Capillary blood was taken 
from all participants for random blood glucose (Accu- 
trend GC system). 
Assessment of vital status at follow-up 
Follow-up was conducted from January 2013 to March 
2014. A meeting was held approximately 1 week before 
the follow-up examination clinic for a given cluster. A list 
of study participants was given to the chief and a local 
village guide was recruited to assist location of the study 
participants. The village guide was someone who knew 
and was well known by the community (or the village 
chief him/herself). The advance team visited homes of 
baseline participants on the day prior to the examination 
clinic and confirmed their identity using the national 
identity cards and invited them to attend the examination 
clinic the following day. All identified participants were 
also asked to help locate baseline participants that had 
not been found. 
Each local field guide was asked to classify the baseline 
study participant for that cluster as ‘available’, ‘died’, 
‘moved away’ or ‘unknown’. A participant was defined to 
have died if this was verified by at least two people from 
among the village chief, local guide or available study 
participant. Those who were known to have moved away 
were contacted when possible to either arrange follow-up 
at a more suitable location for the participant or to iden- 
tify if they were alive or had died in the follow-up period. 
Any participant for whom nobody could identify as being 
alive or having moved away was recorded as ‘unknown’. 
Definitions and statistical analyses 
All participants who had complete examinations at 
baseline were considered ‘at-risk’ for mortality during 
follow-up. Follow-up status at 6 years was categorised as: 
(1) deceased (confirmed dead, as described above); (2) 
alive (ie, re-examined at follow-up, retraced but refused 
or unavailable at follow-up, or moved away but known 
to be alive) (3) unknown (ie, not retraced at follow-up, 
death not verified as described above or moved away but 
vital status unknown). 
An SES score was developed based on information 
collected on job, housing conditions and ownership of 
material goods and livestock, based on previous work in 
the same population.25 Hypertension was defined on the 









basis of the average of the second and third reading, with 
cut-offs used of systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg and/ 
or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg and/or self-re- 
ported hypertension medication. Diabetes was defined as 
(1) self-reported in the history, or (2) random glucose 
of ≥11.0 mmol/L. 
Statistical analysis was performed using STATA V.14 
(Stata). All analyses accounted for the cluster survey 
design using Taylor linearised variance estimation to 
calculate standard errors. Pearson X2 tests corrected for 
the survey design were used to calculate p values to assess 
differences between participants whose mortality status is 
known and those where mortality status is unknown, that 
is, lost to follow-up (LTFU). 
An inverse probability-weighting (IPW) model26 was 
developed, in order to allow estimation of mortality risk 
while accounting for those LTFU. Multivariable logistic 
regression was used to identify independent baseline 
covariates associated with LTFU. Covariates for which 
there was the evidence of univariable association with 
the outcome (p<0.10 across all categories of the variable) 
were kept in a multivariable model (age, sex, rural/urban 
and mother tongue). From this final model, the proba- 
bility of being followed up was estimated, based on the 
presence or absence of each of these baseline covariates. 
The inverse of this probability formed the weighting to be 
applied to account for those LTFU. 
The final step was to remove those individuals LTFU 
from the cohort, so that all subsequent analysis would be 
performed on only those with complete outcome records, 
with IPW applied to account for those LTFU. A sensitivity 
analyses for this approach involved repeating the analyses 
without applying IPW (ie, standard unweighted complete 
case analysis), and assessing the impact on the results. 
Six-year mortality risk was calculated by dividing the 
number of deaths identified at follow-up by the number 
of people at risk at baseline. The 95% CIs were estimated 
assuming a Poisson distribution of events. This was done 
for the population overall, and stratified by each covariate. 
Age/sex-adjusted risk ratios (RRs) for each covariate 
in relation to mortality were estimated using a Poisson 

regression model with robust error variance to allow for 
the clustered design and including IPW. Mortality status 
was the binary outcome and the distribution was assumed 
to be Poisson. These analyses were adjusted for the clus- 
tered design, as well as the use of IPW, by setting the clus- 
ters as the primary sampling unit and weighting using 
the inverse probability of being followed up. The model 
was further adjusted using a set of four SES variables only 
(SES quartile, location, ethnic group, education), then a 
set of five non-communicable disease (NCD) risk factors 
only (smoking, alcohol, diabetes, hypertension, body 
mass index (BMI)) before finally adjusting for all nine 
SES and NCD variables. 
Patient and public involvement 
Patients and the public were not directly involvement in 
the development of the research question and outcome 
measures, or the design or conduct of study. There are 
no plans to disseminate results directly to the study 
participants. 
results 
At baseline, 4414 participants were examined. The 
follow-up assessment was conducted, on average, 5.6 years 
(SD 0.6) after the baseline, expressed for simplicity as 6 
years (meaning that there were 6 years between the base- 
line and follow-up wave, rather than that each participant 
was followed up on average for 6 years as the time of LTFU 
or death was not known for individuals). Of the baseline 
participants, 3032 were known to be alive at follow-up 
(69% 2170 re-examined at the follow-up plus 862 known 
to be alive but not re-examined), 409 (9%) were known to 
have died and 973 had unknown vital status (22%). 
Table 1 provides the baseline characteristics of partic- 
ipants who had died during the follow-up, those were 
re-examined at follow-up and those who were LTFU. In 
comparison to those who had died, those who were re-ex- 
amined were younger, more likely to be female, Kalenjin 
speakers, and had higher SES, while those of unknown

Table 2 shows the weighted 6-year mortality risk by 
level of VI. Overall, the 6-year mortality risk was 11.9% 
over 6 years. Risk increased with worsening levels of 
VI, from 9.7% (95% CI 8.4% to 11.1%) among those 
with normal vision to 38.5% (95% CI 24.5% to 54.8%) 
among those who were blind. This pattern was observed 
in both males and females, but was less clear in people 
aged <60 years given the low mortality in this group and 
consequent small numbers. In each subgroup, the lowest 
risk of mortality was among people with normal vision. 
Mortality risk among people with VI was higher for males 
than for females, and among those ≥60 years vs <60 years. 
Estimates changed little after weighting for LTFU (online 
supplementary table for unweighted estimates). 
Compared with those with normal vision (VA >6/12, 
risk=9.7%), the mortality risk was significantly higher 
among people with VI (VA <6/18 to ≥6/60; risk=28.3%; 
RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.40) or severe VI (SVI)/blind- 
ness (VA <6/60: risk=34.9%; RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.04 to 
3.80) (table 3). There was a weakening of the association 
after adjustment for NCD risk factors or full adjustment 
for both SES and NCD risk factors, although the overall 
trends between worsening vision and increased 6-year 
mortality risk remained evident (VI: RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.14 
to 2.15; SVI/blind: RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.68). 
People with any VI had a higher mortality risk than 
those without VI (29.7% vs 9.7%; RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.22 
to 1.93), and this association remained after adjustment 
for SES and NCD risk factors (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.10 to 
1.71) (table 4). Other risk factors associated with 6-year 
mortality risk after comprehensive adjustment included 
increasing age (oldest vs youngest age group: RR 4.68, 
95% CI 3.55 to 6.18) and diabetes (RR 2.34, 95% CI 
1.81 to 3.03). Being underweight was associated with an 
increased 6-year mortality risk (underweight vs normal: 
RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.07). 
Risk of mortality was analysed by prevalence of specific 
eye diseases at baseline (table 5). The presence of cataract 
(or aphakia/pseudophakia) and any VI (ie, VA <6/18 
in better eye) was associated with higher mortality risk 
(RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.98), whereas cataract alone 
(or aphakia/pseudophakia) was not (RR 1.26, 95% CI 
0.95 to 1.66). Mortality risk was higher among people 
with AMD at baseline (with or without VI), compared 
with those without, although these associations were not 
statistically significant (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.22 and 
RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.81, respectively). DR was asso- 
ciated with a threefold increased mortality risk (RR 3.18, 
95% CI 1.98 to 5.09). The number of people with DR and 
any VI was too small to make meaningful inferences. 
DIsCussIOn 
VI was associated with increased mortality risk during 
6 years of follow-up in a cohort of elderly Kenyan people. 
The risk of mortality increased with worsening vision. This 
association was reduced after adjustment for the presence 
of NCD risk factors, and to a lesser extent for SES indica- 
tors. Among eye conditions, DR was most strongly associ- 
ated with mortality risk, although the number affected was 
small. Cataract with VI was also associated with elevated 
mortality, as were AMD and cataract without visual loss 
at baseline (although these estimates lacked precision). 
Previous studies have also shown a positive relationship 
between VI and mortality, with evidence available from 
the USA,6–9 UK,10 Australia,11 12 Japan,13 Singapore,14 15 
China16 and India.17 Others have failed to find evidence 
for this association, including in India,27 Iceland28 and 
Taiwan.29 Data from LMICs are sparse, in particular for 
sub-Saharan Africa, and so comparison of our study find- 
ings to those from similar settings is not possible. 
On the basis of our findings, and those in the wider liter- 
ature, consideration can be given to the potential pathway 
for the association between VI and mortality. There was 
clear evidence for confounding by age, as both VI and 
mortality are independently related to older age. Conse- 
quently, imperfect adjustment for age may have allowed 
for residual confounding as a partial explanation for the 
association. There was little evidence for confounding by 
SES, although in this setting high SES was associated with 
greater prevalence of NCD risk factors,30 and a somewhat 
reduced mortality risk. The presence of NCD risk factors 
may also act as confounders of the association of VI on 
mortality, since the association was attenuated after adjust- 
ment for these indicators, as found in other studies.10 
Significant associations persisted, however, between VI 
and mortality after comprehensive multivariable adjust- 
ment in this study, as occurred in previous studies,12–14 17 31 
suggesting that residual confounding or direct effects of 
VI on mortality may be operational. 
Exploring the relationship between different eye 
conditions and mortality may help to clarify whether 
independent biological pathways exist. DR is known to 
be associated with increased mortality,15 32 as was also 
shown in this study. This link is unsurprising given the 
well-known relationship between uncontrolled diabetes 
with both DR and mortality. However, the relatively small 
number of people with DR in this population means that 
this link cannot be the sole driver of the VI-mortality asso- 
ciation. Our study, as well as others, has shown cataract to 
be associated with increased mortality,6 12 17 33 34 though 
this association is not always demonstrated.15 35 Some 
studies have suggested that this relationship varies by cata- 
ract type.8 34 36–38 It is hypothesised that the association 
between cataract and mortality arises as lens opacification 
(cataract) is an indicator of accelerated ageing.20 39 The 
evidence for a link between AMD and mortality is more 
complex; some studies show that late AMD is associated 
with mortality, but not early AMD.6 40–42 Others found no 
association between AMD and mortality,15 33 35 or only 
among women.43 
There are other potential pathways between VI and 
mortality not explored in this study. For example, NCD 
risk factors may be mediators of the effect of VI on

mortality (rather than confounders) for reasons such 
as lower ability to access NCD treatment, less exercise, 
poorer diets and so on. Consequently, the association 
between VI and mortality adjusted by NCD risk factors 
would be an underestimate of the total effect. There 
were also concerns about the accuracy of assessment of 
visual fields in this population. Consequently, it was not 
possible to determine the presence of glaucoma at base- 
line, although others have suggested a link between glau- 
coma and mortality.15 44 We also did not assess the impact 
of VI in accessing healthcare, although the Australian 
Blue mountain study showed that difficulties in walking 
explained some of the link between VI and mortality.11 
Only 18 people with cataract underwent cataract surgery 
during the follow-up period, so it was not possible to 
assess the impact on mortality. 
There are several further limitations of the study, which 
need to be considered when interpreting the findings. 
There was a lack of data on date of death, and no verifica- 
tion from death certificates, as these are rarely available 
in many African settings,45 including Kenya. Cause of 
death could not be determined, and so we could not 
assess whether the relationship was stronger between VI 
and specific causes of mortality, notably cardiovascular 
and non-cancer causes, as demonstrated in previous 
studies,15 46–48 which would lend weight to a biological 
pathway for the association. The follow-up study was 
conducted after a period of postelection violence in the 
area. Consequently, there was a high LTFU in this study, 
raising the possibility of selection bias influencing the 
findings, although patterns changed little after weighting 
for LTFU. We did not adjust for the population sampling 
weights in our analysis, and so there could be concerns 
about the representativeness of the sample, although the 
selected sample had a similar demographic distribution 
to the general population.49 Furthermore, the mortality 
rate may have been higher in this period, due to violence, 
and may have biased the association with VI if these deaths 
were disproportionally among people with VI, or among 
younger people (with lower prevalence of VI). Date of

LTFU or death was not recorded, and so survival analysis 
was not possible. Another concern is that reports of local 
informants were used to categorise some people who had 
moved away as ‘known to be alive’, which may have created 
inaccuracies. The study may have been underpowered for 
some of the subgroup analyses, such as assessing the link 
between type of eye disease and mortality. We did not eval- 
uate the association of different subtypes of AMD or cata- 
ract in relation to mortality because of small numbers. VI 
classification did not include loss of visual fields, and so 
the prevalence of functionally significant sight loss may 
have been underestimated. Self-reported diabetes was 
not confirmed (eg, from medical records). In terms of 
strengths, this was the first study of its kind in sub-Saharan 
Africa to assess the association between VI and mortality. 
The study participants comprised a representative popu- 
lation-based sample in an area of ethnic, SES and educa- 
tional diversity. There was a comprehensive assessment 
of ophthalmic characteristics and risk factors at baseline, 
and every attempt was made to follow up all participants, 
and to record vital status. 
In conclusion, VA was related to 6-year mortality 
risk in this cohort of elderly Kenyan people. The most 
likely explanation for the association is that both VI and 
mortality are related to ageing and NCD risk factors. The 
implication is that continuity of care is needed, as people 
with VI require linkages to preventative and treatment 
services. Furthermore, we must advocate for the scale-up 
of eye care services in Kenya, as VI is linked to premature 
mortality.
