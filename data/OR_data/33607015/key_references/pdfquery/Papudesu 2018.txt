Objectives—To evaluate the association of mortality with visual acuity (VA) impairment, age- 
related macular degeneration (AMD), and cataract surgery. 

Subjects—Participants with at least intermediate AMD enrolled in a randomized controlled 
clinical trial of lutein/zeaxanthin and/or omega-3 fatty acids, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 
(AREDS2) for treatment of AMD and cataract. 
Methods—Baseline and annual eye examinations included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 
assessments, slit lamp examinations, and stereoscopic fundus photographs that were centrally 
graded for development of late AMD (central geographic atrophy or neovascular AMD) or 
pseudophakia. Cause-specific mortality was determined based on ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes. Risk of 
all-cause and cause-specific mortality was assessed with Cox proportional hazards models 
adjusted for age, sex, AMD severity, VA, history of cataract surgery, and assigned AREDS2 study 
treatment. Analyses included baseline covariates: race, education, smoking status, diabetes, and 
cardiovascular disease. 
Results—During follow-up (median 5 years), 368 (9%) of the 4203 AREDS2 participants died. 
Participants with neovascular AMD in 1 eye at baseline had a statistically significant increased 
risk for mortality compared to participants with no or few drusen (hazard ratio [HR] 1.56, 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.21–2.01; p-value [p]<0.001). Poorer survival was associated with 
bilateral cataract surgery prior to enrollment compared with baseline bilateral phakia (HR, 1.63; 
95% CI, 1.29–2.07; p<0.001); and with BCVA of less than 20/40 compared with participants with 
20/40 or better (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.06–2.30; p=0.024), adjusted for age, sex and statistically

significant covariates. Participants who received anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies 
for neovascular AMD had decreased mortality compared with those who did not (HR: 0.71, 95% 
CI 0.57–0.88; p=0.002). The association between all-cause mortality and AREDS2 treatment 
whether assessing the main or individual treatment effect was not significantly different [omega-3 
fatty acids main effect HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.96–1.45, p=0.12; lutein/zeaxanthin main effect HR 
1.04, 95% CI 0.85–1.28, p=0.71]. 
Conclusions—In AREDS2, the presence of late AMD, bilateral cataract surgery and visual 
acuity less than 20/40 were associated with decreased survival. However, oral supplementation 
with omega-3 fatty acids, lutein plus zeaxanthin, zinc, or beta-carotene had no statistically 
significant impact on mortality. 

Age-related eyes diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataract 
are the leading causes of visual impairment in the older population in the United States.1 
Visual impairment has been reported to be associated with mortality in several 
studies2–7, 11,12,19,23,29. Although the relationship between AMD or cataract with survival 
has been less clear, AMD was associated with decreased survival in some studies7–8,11–12, 
but others reported no statistical significance after adjustment for appropriate 
confounders3,13,18–19,28. The pathogenesis of AMD is unknown; however, it is commonly 
noted that AMD shares several risk factors for cardiovascular and other systemic 
comorbidities that could attribute to shorter survival12,14–17. However, few studies have 
evaluated the impact of late AMD (non-foveal or center-involved geographic atrophy or 
neovascularization) on mortality in a large cohort. Cataract has been linked to decreased 
survival, particularly for the nuclear opacity type vs cortical or subcapsular, in 
some2–3, 8–10, 19–21 but not all studies13, 18,28. The association of mortality and a clinical 
history of cataract surgery has not been well established26–27,29–32. While reasons for 
shorter survival in persons with cataracts or cataract surgery are not known, the presence of 
cataract may be possible markers for biological aging. The role of oxidative stress and 
inflammatory processes may also be suggested by previous studies of decreased survival 
with cataract3,8,26–27. 
The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) is a randomized, clinical trial of 
nutritional supplements in persons with at least intermediate AMD. The mean age of the 
population was 74 years of age and they were followed for a median follow-up of 5 years.24 
The AREDS2 study offers an opportunity to study the relationship of ocular diseases and 
mortality. This current study is undertaken to assess the impact of visual impairment, AMD, 
and history of cataract surgery on survival. 


The AREDS2 study, a randomized, double-masked, controlled trial of oral supplements 
sponsored by the National Eye Institute, enrolled between 2006 and 2008, 4,203 men and 
women aged 50 to 80 with bilateral intermediate AMD or late AMD in one eye. The study 



concluded in October 2012 with a median follow-up of 5 years. This 2x2 factorial trial 
evaluated the addition of high dose antioxidants lutein (10mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg) and/or 
omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids: docosahexaenoic acid (DHA [350mg]) and 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA [650mg]) to the original AREDS formulation in reducing the 
primary outcome of AMD and cataract progression. The original AREDS formulation 
consisted of vitamin C (500mg), E (400 IU), beta-carotene (15mg), zinc (80mg as zinc 
oxide), and copper (2mg as cupric oxide). The AREDS2 participants underwent primary 
randomization to four arms: controls (n=1012), lutein/zeaxanthin (n=1044), DHA plus EPA 
(n=1069), and a combination of lutein/zeaxanthin and DHA plus EPA (n=1078). 
Approximately three-quarters of the population agreed to a secondary randomization that 
tested the original AREDS supplements with and without beta-carotene (15mg) and high 
(80mg) or low-dose (25mg) zinc formulations.34 
Participants eligible for the study included those who were willing and able to undergo 
yearly examination for at least five years and demonstrated adherence to the run-in regimen 
(consumption of 75% of run-in medication determined by pill weight or pill count). 
Participants had to be free of any health conditions that would make follow-up or 
compliance with study interventions difficult. Participants with any systemic disease with a 
poor 5-year survival prognosis or had previous retinal or ocular surgeries (other than cataract 
extraction) that may confound evaluation were excluded. This study protocol was reviewed 
and approved by each of the institutional review boards, and written informed consent was 
obtained from all participants. The research was conducted according to the tenets of the 
Declaration of Helsinki and complied with the Health Portability and Accountability Act. 
Baseline and annual study visits included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) assessment, 
slit lamp examination, dilated fundus examinations and ocular imaging (red reflex lens 
photos, stereoscopic color fundus photographs, and fundus autofluorescence). At baseline 
visits, participant demographics including education level, smoking status, comorbidity such 
as diabetes or cardiovascular health, and medication use were collected. At telephone 
interviews at the 6-month interval between annual study visits, we gathered data on the 
occurrence of cataract surgery, AMD treatment, and other medical conditions as well as 
adverse effects. The ocular images were evaluated at baseline and annually by certified and 
trained masked readers at a central reading center at the University of Wisconsin. 
Participants enrolled in the study were at high risk for progression to late AMD ranging 
from bilateral large drusen to large drusen in one eye and late AMD in the fellow eye. This 
translates to the AREDS AMD Simple Scale of 2, 3, and 4.35 The simple scale was a person- 
scale that included both eyes and the scale was based upon the presence of large drusen or 
retinal pigment epithelial hypo/hyperpigmentary changes or the presence of late AMD.35, 25 
The reading center also evaluated the progression to late AMD (either central geographic 
atrophy or neovascular AMD) based upon stereoscopic fundus photographs obtained at 
annual visits. The presence of pseudophakia was also noted on the red reflex lens photos as 
well as at the slit lamp examination at the study visit. 




The primary outcome measure for this study was all-cause mortality. The underlying cause 
of death (defined by the World Health Organization [WHO] as the injury or the disease that 
initiated events that led to death } was usually selected as the primary cause of death. In the 
case that the death certificate was not provided then the immediate cause of death was used. 
The immediate cause of death is defined by WHO as the disease or injury that led directly to 
the cause of death. In cases of discrepancy, a mortality review team consisting of diagnostic 
coders and physicians determined the cause of death. 

Risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality was assessed using age and sex-adjusted Cox 
proportional hazards regression models with AMD severity (Simple Scale score 1 to 4) and 
type of late AMD, neovascular or geographic atrophy associated with AMD, visual acuity 
(VA), history of cataract surgery prior to enrollment, and assigned AREDS2 treatment as 
independent variables to estimate risk ratios. Baseline covariates included race (non- 
Hispanic white vs other), education (high school or less vs. more than high school), smoking 
status (never, former, or current), diabetes, medication-use (Centrum multivitamins and/or 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)/other anti-inflammatory agents), cancer, 
and cardiovascular health status (history of congestive heart disease, coronary heart disease, 
angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hypercholesterolemia). Analyses also included 
self-reported hypertension as a covariate. Significant covariates (P<0.05) were added to 
models predicting the effects of ocular characteristics on mortality. Age was stratified to 4 
different age groups: <65 years, 65–74 years, 75–79 years and ≥80 years, since this covariate 
has been strongly associated with risk of developing AMD and mortality7,11. All analyses 
were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). 
Between 2006 and 2008, AREDS2 enrolled 4,203 participants aged 50 to 80 years with 
bilateral intermediate AMD or late AMD in one eye. The median age at baseline was 74 
years and 57% were women. From September 2006 to December 2012, 368 (9%) of the 
AREDS2 study population died. The effects of baseline characteristics on all-cause mortality 
are shown in Table 1. After adjustment for age and sex, mortality rates were higher for 
increasing age. The hazard ratios (HRs) for age-stratified analysis almost doubled for each 
decade of age (65–74 years, HR of 2.25; 75–79 years, HR of 4.64; 80+ years, HR of 7.79). 
Adjusted mortality rates were lower for females, “other” races (black, Asian and others), and 
participants with education level more than high school. Mortality rates were higher for 
current smokers, persons with diabetes, and participants with high blood pressure and 
history for CVD (congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, and 
stroke). 


All-cause mortality rates are shown in Table 2. Mortality rates increased with increasing 
AMD severity in age and sex adjusted Cox-regression models, adjusting for all the 
covariates. Persons with the most severe AMD simple scale of 4 had a hazard ratio (HR) of 



1.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19–2.50, p-value (p)=0.004, when compared with 
simple scale of 1 and 2, which consist of milder disease with either large drusen in only one 
eye or large drusen in both eyes or retinal pigment epithelial changes. Those participants 
with AREDS Simple Scale level 3 were also at an increased risk of mortality with HR of 
1.60, 95% CI: 1.07–2.40, p=0.022. When the severity of AMD was classified as 
intermediate, geographic atrophy at the center, or neovascular AMD, the risk of mortality 
was associated with neovascular AMD (HR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.21–2.01; p < 0.001). Note in 
this comparison, the reference group consisted of those with intermediate AMD in both 
eyes. 
Mortality rates were higher for those participants who had bilateral cataract surgery prior to 
enrollment into AREDS2 (HR of 1.63, 95% CI: 1.29–2.07; p<0.001) compared with no 
surgery. BCVA less than 20/40 in one or both eyes were associated with statistically 
significant increased risk of all-cause mortality. For unilaterally affected participants, the HR 
was 1.32 and 95% CI 1.05–1.66; p=0.017 while for bilaterally affected, the HR was 1.56; 
95% CI, 1.06 – 2.30; p=0.024 when compared with participants with vision better than 
20/40 in both eyes. The association between all-cause mortality and the AREDS2 treatment 
effect whether assessing the main effect of each nutrient or individual treatment arms was 
not significant after adjustments for age, sex, demographics, lifestyle and comorbid 
conditions. As previously published38, the main treatment effects of combination DHA and 
EPA and the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin did not show significant benefit or harm on 
mortality (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.96–1.45; p=0.12 and HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.85–1.28; p=0.71, 
respectively). No statistical association was found with primary randomization of individual 
treatment groups DHA/EPA and lutein/zeaxanthin (Table 2). AREDS2 treatment secondary 
randomization to high (80 mg) vs low zinc (25 mg) and beta-carotene vs no beta-carotene 
did not have a significant effect on mortality (Table 2). Kaplan-Meier curves for mortality by 
AREDS AMD simple scale score, cataract surgery, visual impairment, and AREDS2 
nutritional treatments are demonstrated in Figure 1(A, B, C, and D). 

Cause-specific mortality rates are shown in Table 3. Neovascular AMD was associated with 
a statistically significant increase in circulatory system and neoplastic causes of death, HR of 
1.68 (95% CI 1.04–2.71; p=0.034) and HR of 1.87 (95% CI 1.08–3.24; p=0.027), 
respectively (Table 3). Geographic atrophy was associated with neoplastic causes of death, 
HR of 3.37 (95% CI 1.56– 7.29, p=0.002). For other causes of mortality which include 
infections, pneumonia, chronic pulmonary disease, trauma and others, more severe AMD as 
classified by the AREDS simple scale, specifically simple scale scores of 3 and 4 were 
associated with increased risk of mortality: HR: 1.89 (95% CI: 1.01–3.55; p=0.048) and HR: 
2.29 (95% CI: 1.28–4.10; p=0.005), respectively (Table 3). Bilateral cataract surgery and 
bilateral visual impairment were also associated with increased risk of other-cause mortality: 
HR: 2.12 (95% CI: 1.51–2.97; p<0.001) and HR: 2.17 (95% CI: 1.35–3.50; p=0.001), 
respectively (Table 3). 




Since 1,606 AREDS2 participants received anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
therapy for neovascular AMD, we evaluated the impact of this therapy on all-cause 
mortality. There was reduced mortality risk for those receiving anti-VEGF therapies with the 
HR of 0.71 and 95% CI of 0.57–0.88, p=0.002 (Table 2). 

Specific causes of death and broad-based groupings are shown in Table 4. ICD-9 and 
ICD-10 codes were available for cause of death for 325 (88.3%) out of 368 participants who 
died. Some of the known causes of deaths were cardiovascular (88/269 or 23.9%) and 
neoplastic (90/269 (24.4%) in origin (Table 4). Cause of death was unknown for 43(11.7%) 
participants without sufficient mortality follow-up data while the remainder were due to a 
number of other causes (147/368 or 39.9%) (Table 4). 

As expected, the mortality rates were increased in those AREDS2 participants who were 
older, current smokers, had diabetes, less formal education and/or comorbid cardiovascular 
conditions. We also found an association of increased mortality in those with more severe 
AMD, either simple score 3 and 4 or those with late forms of AMD, neovascular AMD or 
geographic atrophy. Previous studies assessing the relationship between AMD and mortality 
have been inconclusive.3,7–8,10–13,18–19,28 During a median follow-up of 6.5 years, the 
original AREDS study found decreased survival in those with late AMD compared to those 
with mild AMD in fully-adjusted models (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.08–1.86).8 The Reykjavik 
Study which examined mortality in association with AMD in community-dwelling elders 
found that participants 83 years and older had significantly increased all-cause mortality risk 
(HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.20–2.57) and CVD (HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.41–3.98) in the presence of late 
AMD. No association was seen in individuals with early AMD at any age and late AMD in 
those <83 years.11 A study assessing AMD and mortality over a 15-year follow-up period in 
a population of older women in the United States also showed increased all-cause mortality 
(HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.13–1.78) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.01–2.09) for 
those 80 years and older with any AMD. In this same study, late AMD was associated with 
cardiovascular disease mortality in women younger than 80 years.7 In contrast, five large 
population-based cohort studies, including the Rotterdam Study13, Beijing Eye Study19, 
Beaver Dam Eye Study3, Blue Mountains Eye Study10, and Singapore Malay Eye Study18 
showed no statistically significant association between late AMD and decreased survival. 
The mean age of participants in these studies were younger (range 60–70 years) and had 
fewer participants with late AMD than those in the AREDS2 cohort (mean age 74 years). In 
the Atherosclerosis in the Community Study, persons with late AMD were more likely in 10 
years to die (23.5%) compared with those without late AMD (8.9%, p=0.088). Those with 
late AMD were also more likely to develop incident cardiovascular event (30.9%) vs. those 
without late AMD (10.0%, P=0.049).39 After the 10 years of follow-up in participants aged 
less than 75 years at baseline, the Blue Mountains Eye Study reported both two-fold and 
five-fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in those persons with early AMD or late 
AMD, respectively.40 Late AMD also predicted a ten-fold higher risk of stroke mortality. 



In the analyses for the cause-specific mortality in AREDS2, it appeared that two specific 
causes, cardiovascular (or circulatory), neoplastic and other causes were associated with 
more severe AMD. The cause-specific mortality for neovascular AMD was associated with 
both circulatory system and neoplasms while central geographic atrophy was associated with 
neoplasms. When the AMD was classified by the AREDS simple scale, both levels 3 and 4 
were found to be associated with other causes of death. Participants with late AMD are 
likely to be older with comorbidities impacting survival. We cannot fully adjust for the 
effects of age and other unknown confounders. 
For both visual impairment (BCVA <20/40 in both eyes) and bilateral cataract surgery in 
AREDS2 participants, we found a doubling of the risk of mortality compared to those 
without visual impairment or bilateral cataract surgery. Similarly, in AREDS, visual 
impairment (BCVA <20/40 in at least one eye) and cataract surgery were also associated 
with decreased survival.8 Late AMD was strongly associated with visual impairment, and 
the visual impairment findings in AREDS were not independent from AMD severity. Other 
studies that evaluated the impact of visual impairment on mortality independent of other 
comorbidities or risk factors reported conflicting results. The Blue Mountains Eye Study 
found no association of visual impairment with mortality.10 The Beaver Dam Eye Study3 
reported a significant association with visual impairment and all-cause mortality after 
adjustment for systemic and lifestyle characteristics. The Melbourne Visual Impairment 
Project5,22 noted more than a two-fold increase in mortality risk in fully-adjusted models for 
participants with BCVA <6/18, suggesting that visual impairment may be associated with 
increased falls and accidents contributing to increased mortality rates. However, it is 
uncertain to what extent AMD status plays a role in visual impairment, since AMD data 
were not collected on these participants. 
The relationship between age-related cataract and poor survival has been observed in several 
epidemiology studies2,3,8,10,19–21. In previous analysis of the AREDS cohort, all-cause 
mortality was significantly increased for those participants with nuclear cataract or history of 
cataract surgery8. These participants also had increased deaths from neoplasms. History of 
bilateral cataract surgery at baseline was statistically significantly associated with all-cause 
mortality but not related to neoplastic causes in the AREDS2 cohort. Cataract surgery was 
associated with other causes of death. History of cataract surgery has not been consistently 
shown to be associated with poor survival in prior studies26–27,31–32. Several large 
population-based studies that reported no association between cataract surgery at baseline 
and mortality include the Rotterdam Study13, Singapore Malay Eye Study18, and the Blue 
Mountains Eye Study3. However, a retrospective cohort study investigating a random 5% 
sample of the United States Medicare population (2002–2012) with cataract (1.5 million 
participants) found that those who underwent cataract surgery and followed up for an 
average of close to 3 years had a lower adjusted hazard of mortality compared to those 
surgery-free (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.72–0.74)9. This study and others29,30 reported a protective 
association after cataract surgery after adjusting for ocular and systemic comorbidities. The 
conflicting findings from studies may arise from the inherent differences in the cataract 
surgery group vs the non-surgery group. In addition, the factors involved in selecting eligible 
participants for cataract surgery may further complicate data interpretation. 



The mechanism of action surrounding the association between visual impairment caused by 
cataract and AMD and mortality is not clear. One hypothesis supported by some studies 
suggests that visual impairment may have a direct impact on survival, affecting functional 
status of participants and even psychological health4,6,28. Poor vision can result in limited 
mobility, falls, and accidents resulting in a variety of injuries7,9. In the AREDS2 cohort, very 
few deaths were attributed to automobile accidents, falls or trauma-related deaths (0.04%). 
Visual impairment could be associated with depression, which has been linked with poor 
quality of life and decreased life span23,36. Cause-specific analyses did not show excess 
mortality among AREDS2 participants with mental health disorders (0.03%). Ocular-related 
depression may have played a factor as participants included in the study were at high risk to 
progression to late AMD. However, our analyses of the test of depression, the Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies’ Depression Scale (CES-D) (Table 1) which was administered at 
baseline, showed no association of depression with mortality (HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.98 – 
1.58, p=0.072). 
The mechanisms for the association AMD and cataract with increased risk of mortality 
remain to be elucidated. Analyses in the AREDS cohort suggested AMD shares risk factors 
for comorbid conditions, especially cardiovascular disease12,14–17. Non-cardiovascular/non- 
cancer cause-specific mortality was significant in AREDS2 follow-up with a majority of 
deaths categorized under respiratory diseases (16%) or unknown (12%). Mortality was more 
prevalent in elderly participants (75+ years) with severe AMD. This AMD-mortality 
relationship was further supported by other studies, including the Beaver Dam Eye Study 
that reported more severe AMD classification with increasing age3. Systemic processes 
accelerating the aging process and contributing to poor survival could partially explain these 
findings. Similarly, cataract may reflect systemic aging and possibly contribute to 
inflammatory pathways leading to shorter survival8,26–27. 
A somewhat surprising finding is the increased survival of those AREDS2 participants who 
had received anti-VEGF therapies compared with those who have not received anti-VEGF 
therapies. However, in about 40% of this group, we were not able to ascertain the number of 
injections administered as these were participants who had exposure to the anti-VEGF 
therapies at baseline. We collected the data on the number of anti-VEGF therapies given 
only during the course of the study. The HR for mortality for the group who had exposure to 
anti-VEGF at baseline but the number of injections was unknown, was not statistically 
significantly different from those who had not received anti-VEGF therapy. In the 
participants whose numbers of injections were known, there was a dose-response in that 
participants with greater injections of anti-VEGF therapies were associated with lower 
mortality. A limitation to these data was the small number of participants who received the 
larger number of injections. We also found an interaction of the number of treatments with 
the age of the participants. Older participants were less likely to receive anti-VEGF 
therapies. Interestingly, a study from the Veterans Health Administration41 of men 55 years 
or older with a diagnosis of AMD evaluated mortality among those who received anti- 
vascular endothelial growth factor agents vs. those who did not. The twelve-month all-cause 
mortality were 3.5% in the treated vs. 4.5% in the untreated. The adjusted analyses showed 
the hazards ratio of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.74–1.06), with the point estimate also not in the 
direction of harm but this was not statistically significant. The all-cause mortality risk was 



similar for both administration of bevacizumab and ranibizumab. In the Inhibition of VEGF 
in Age-related choroidal Neovascularisation (IVAN) trial where these two anti-VEGF 
therapies were compared, using different treatment regimens, there was reduced mortality in 
those participants who had continuous (monthly) administration of the anti-VEGF therapies 
compared with those who had greater intervals between their “discontinuous” therapies (OR: 
0.47, 95% CI: 0.22–1.03, p=0.05). Again, there was no difference in mortality between the 
two anti-VEGF drugs (OR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.46–2.02, p=0.91). A possible explanation for the 
reduced mortality in those who received anti-VEGF therapies may reflect a selection bias of 
administering the therapy to healthier and more active participants in AREDS2. Contributing 
to this selection bias is the increased mortality of those with more severe or late AMD that 
may have further resulted in a more robust younger group who received additional anti- 
VEGF therapies as death is truly a competing risk for this cohort. These interesting findings 
warrant further studies designed to evaluate among persons with AMD the impact of anti- 
VEGF therapies on mortality. 
There were no statistically significant associations with all-cause mortality in participants 
assigned to the AREDS2 treatment interventions. The AREDS nutritional supplement 
treatment modifications of zinc and beta-carotene also showed no statistically significant 
effect on mortality. Prior observational follow-up in the AREDS cohort suggested a 
protective association with either zinc alone or in combination with antioxidants and 
decreased all-cause mortality. No statistically significant association was found with oral 
zinc supplementation at a high (80mg) or low (25mg) dose. Addition of lutein and 
zeaxanthin, omega-3 fatty acids, individually or combined as well as the removal of beta- 
carotene from the original AREDS formulation did not have an apparent effect on survival. 
Strengths of the current study include a large cohort enrolled at 82 clinical centers across 
various regions of the United States, low attrition rate, standardized gradings of fundus 
photographs for reproducible study endpoints, a relatively long follow-up, almost complete 
registry of deaths, and data on a variety of covariates. This study also enrolled a large 
portion of participants with late AMD, increasing our power and allowing us to evaluate the 
impact of late AMD on mortality independent of significant confounders. Like any other 
clinical trial, the current AREDS2 participants tend to be well-educated, health-conscious 
individuals are considerably more likely to volunteer in clinical trials.33,37 In this 
observational portion of the study, adjustment for significant covariates may not have been 
complete, as AMD shares several risk factors for many confounding comorbidities. 
Participants with a history of cataract surgery at baseline may be inherently different from 
those who did not undergo surgery, further confounding mortality outcomes. However, 
AMD category was more evenly distributed among the cataract surgery and non-surgery 
groups. Inclusion of AMD category as a significant covariate in fully-adjusted models 
diminished the impact of bias on study findings. 
In summary, increased mortality was associated with late AMD, bilateral cataract surgery 
and visual acuity <20/40. This may indeed reflect an aging process and residual confounding 
is difficult to eliminate. There was no increased mortality in those participants who received 
anti-VEGF therapies throughout the study. Oral supplementation with AREDS2 treatment 
modifications did not have a significant effect on survival outcomes. The impact of ocular 



disorders on long-term mortality may be related to common factors for both increased risk 
of eye disease and mortality, suggesting systemic rather than local involvement. The clinical 
assessment and management in older persons with intermediate to advanced ocular disease 
status may present with challenges. Early detection of age-related eye diseases in this 
population may prevent deterioration of visual acuity and improve quality of life.

Figure 1. 
Figure 1A: The rates of mortality (Kaplan-Meier curve) by baseline severity of age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD), using the AREDS AMD simple score scale, based on 



presence of large drusen, retinal pigmentary changes, and late AMD. The more severe AMD 
cases (simple scale score of 3 and 4) were associated with greater mortality rates. 
Figure 1B: The rates of mortality (Kaplan-Meier curve) by baseline cataract surgery (none, 1 
eye, or both eyes). The AREDS2 participants who had bilateral cataract surgery had a 
greater rate of mortality compared to those without cataract surgery. 
Figure 1C. The rates of mortality (Kaplan-Meier curve) by baseline visual impairment, 
(none, one eye, or both eyes with visual acuity worse than 20/40). Having vision worse than 
20/40 in either or both eyes was associated with increased mortality. 
Figure 1D. The rates of mortality (Kaplan-Meier curve) by the Age-Related Eye Disease 
Study 2 (AREDS2) study supplements: control, lutein plus zeaxanthin, omega-3 fatty acids 
and the combination of lutein/zeaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids. There were no 
statistically significant differences in the mortality rates between these treatment arms.
