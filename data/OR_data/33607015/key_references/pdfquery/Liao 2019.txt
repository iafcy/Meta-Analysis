Objective: To assess the joint impact of cognitive performance and visual acuity on 
mortality over 13-year follow-up in a representative US sample. 
Methods: Data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
participants (≥18 years old) were linked with the death record data of the National Death 
Index (NDI) with mortality follow-up through December 31, 2011. Cognitive performance 
was evaluated by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and cognitive performance 
impairment was deﬁned as the DSST score equal to or less than the median value in the 
study population. Visual impairment (VI) was deﬁned as presenting visual acuity worse 
than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye. Risks of all-cause and speciﬁc-cause mortality were 
estimated with Cox proportional hazards models after adjusting for confounders. 
Results: A total of 2,550 participants 60 years and older from two waves of (NHANES, 
1999–2000, 2001–2002) were included in the current analysis. Over a median follow- 
up period of 9.92 years, 952 (35.2%) died of all causes, of whom 239 (23.1%), 
224 (24.0%), and 489 (52.9%) died from cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and 
non-CVD/non-cancer mortality, respectively. Cognitive performance impairment and VI 
increased the odds for mortality. Co-presence of VI among cognitive impaired elderly 
persons predicted nearly a threefold increased risk of all-cause mortality [hazard ratios 
(HRs), 2.74; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 2.02–3.70; P < 0.001) and almost a fourfold 
higher risk of non-CVD/non-cancer mortality (HR, 3.72; 95% CI, 2.30–6.00; P < 0.001) 
compared to having neither impairment. 
Conclusion: People aged 60 years and over with poorer cognitive performance were 
at higher risk of long-term mortality, and were especially vulnerable to further mortality 
when concomitant with VI. It is informative for clinical 
implication in terms of early 
preventive interventions.

With Vision Acuity Predicts 13-Year 
Risk for Mortality.

Life expectancy in industrialized countries has been projected to 
increase continuously, with most of the projected gains occurring 
in older ages (Kontis et al., 2017). However, a non-negligible 
disadvantage to gains in longevity is the increased risk of the 
impairment of both vision and cognition with age. VI is highly 
prevalent among aged people, not only leading to morbidity, but 
imposing an impact on the risk of mortality as well (Zhang et al., 
2016; Zhu et al., 2016). It has been estimated that the number 
of visually impaired people could double by 2050 (Varma et al., 
2016). The extended life expectancy and aging population, rising 
rapidly around the world, have also led to increasing prevalence 
of dementia (Brookmeyer et al., 2007). Cognitive decline and 
impairment associated with age have also been proposed to be 
linked with an increased mortality (Sachs et al., 2011). Hence, 
well-established identiﬁcation and management on both visual 
and cognitive impairment are particularly crucial for improving 
health in later lives. 
Emerging evidence suggests a strong linkage between 
impairment of vision and cognitive impairment (Rogers and 
Langa, 2010; Elyashiv et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2017). It has 
been proposed in large cohort studies that higher rates of 
cognitive performance impairment exist among aged adults 
with VI (Elyashiv et al., 2014). In a prospective cohort study, 
VI has been demonstrated to predict cognitive decline (Lin 
et al., 2004). Furthermore, several studies have shown improved 
cognitive performance scores by treating reduced vision via 
cataract surgery (Tamura et al., 2004; 
Ishii et al., 2008). 
Alternatively, severe cognitive performance impairment may 
raise the risk of incident functional VI, even though the eyes 
remain structurally healthy (Chen et al., 2017). Although VI 
and cognitive performance impairment have been associated 
with mortality separately as mentioned above, much less is 
known about the joint eﬀects of cognitive impairment and VI 
on mortality. It has been reported that concomitant VI and 
cognitive impairment increases mortality in a US study (Liu 
et al., 2016), while no relation was found in a Japanese study 
(Mitoku et al., 2016). Notably, in those two studies, VI was 
assessed by self-reporting and the generalizability of the studies 
are limited. Furthermore, those two studies did not explore the 
speciﬁc mortality associated with the joint eﬀect of visual and 
cognitive impairment. 
The NHANES is a continuous population-based study, which 
provides an opportunity to investigate the impact of cognitive 
performance concomitant with VI on mortality in a nationally 
representative population of the non-institutionalized US civi- 
lian. We hypothesize that not only does cognitive performance 
impairment and VI independently predicts mortality, but the 
combination of both also predicts increase mortality. 

Sample and Population 
This dataset was extracted from two cycles of NHANES 
(1999–2000, 2001–2002), which is an ongoing study conducted 
every 2 years by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
and National Center for Health Statistics (2005). Participants 
were recruited from the US non-institutionalized civilian 
population using stratiﬁed multistage design, with oversampling 
of certain subgroups1. Participants were invited to a mobile 
examination center for an extensive examination that included 
physical examinations, laboratory tests, and questionnaires. All 
participants were informed about the study and gave their written 
consent prior to assessments. The study protocols and data 
collection were conducted according to ethical standards. The 
research adhered to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Assessment of Cognitive Performance 
The DSST was included in the 1999–2002 cycles of NHANES to 
assess cognitive performance among participants aged 60 years 
and older. The DSST is a widely used test with high sensitivity 
for assessing sustained attention, psychomotor speed, and 
working memory in epidemiologic and neuropsychologic studies 
(Wechsler, 2007). Based on codes, participants were required 
to pair the numbers (1–9) with corresponding symbols. The 
total number of correctly matched symbols within 2 min 
was calculated for the DSST points (0–133). Higher correct 
scores represent better cognitive performance. Since there is 
no gold standard cutoﬀ for cognitive performance impairment 
based on the DSST score, we deﬁned cognitive performance 
impairment as below the median DSST score (DSST value of 40), 
consistent with methods previously described in other studies 
(Loprinzi et al., 2017). 
Assessment of Visual Acuity 
Presenting visual acuity was evaluated for each eye with 
vision correction with an 
participants’ usual distance 
autorefractor (ARK-760, Nidek Co., Ltd.). Details of methods 
for visual acuity measurement have been described elsewhere 
(Ko et al., 2012). Presenting visual acuity worse than 20/40 
in the better-seeing eye was used to deﬁne VI based on the 
latest guidelines of 
the US Preventive Services Task Force 
(Chou et al., 2016). 
Mortality Data 
Mortality data were obtained from the NDI 
through a 
probabilistic matching algorithm (Loprinzi and Addoh, 2016). 
Mortality for NHANES participants (≥18 years old) was 
followed-up through December 31, 2011. Participants were 
considered alive when they could not be matched with NDI 
data. The speciﬁc cause of death was coded according to the 
tenth revision of ICD, Injuries and Causes of death (ICD-10). 
ICD-10 codes I00-I09, I11, I13, and I20-I51 were used to deﬁne 
the death from heart disease, and codes I60-I69 indicated to the 
decease from cerebrovascular diseases. The combination codes 
of deaths from heart disease and cerebrovascular diseases were 
used to represent deaths from CVD. ICD-10 codes C00-C97 were 
used to deﬁne cancer mortality. Those who were not classiﬁed 
as CVD or cancer-related deaths were considered as death due 
to non-CVD/non-cancer cause. The follow-up period for each 










participant was calculated as the time length from the date of the 
interview to either the date of death or at the end of the follow-up 
(December 31, 2011), whichever happened ﬁrst. 
Covariates 
Covariates were selected on the basis of established association 
in previous studies both with exposure (VI or cognitive 
performance) and outcome (mortality) (Chen et al., 2017). All 
sociodemographic factors (age, gender, race, education level, 
marital status, and PIR), health-related behaviors (smoking status 
and alcohol consumption), and comorbid medical conditions 
(BMI, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, CRP level, 
history of CVD, and cancer) were assessed using self-reported 
questionnaires or laboratory tests. 
Ethnicity was classiﬁed as Non-Hispanic White, Non- 
Hispanic Black, Mexican American, and other. Education level 
was classiﬁed as less than high school degree and equal to or 
more than high school diploma. Marital status (unmarried and 
other, married/with a partner) was categorized as a two-level 
covariate. PIR, the indicator of family income, was categorized 
as below poverty (<1.00) and at or above poverty (≥1.00). 
Smoking status was deﬁned as two groups: never, former/current 
smoker. Alcohol consumption was classiﬁed as lifetime abstainer 
or former drinker, current drinker with equal to or less than 3, 
and current drinker with more than three drinks per week. 
Body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided 
by height in meters squared. Participants were deﬁned as having 
diabetes if they had self-reported physician diagnosis of diabetes, 
glycosylated hemoglobin (%) levels of 6.5% or more, or used 
insulin or the prescription of diabetic agents (Varma et al., 
2014). The presence of hypertension was deﬁned by self-reported 
history of hypertension; or the use of antihypertensive agents; 
or mean systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg; and/or mean 
diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg after three measurements. 
Individuals were classiﬁed as having high cholesterol with serum 
total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL or the use of lipid-lowering agent. 
High level of CRP was deﬁned as CRP 1 mg/dL or over. 
History of CVD was deﬁned by physician diagnosis of congestive 
heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack, or 
stroke. History of cancer was based on a previous physician’s 
diagnosis of cancer. 
Statistical Analysis 
We followed the standard NHANES analytic procedures for 
weighting, taking the complex, stratiﬁed design of NHANES into 
account. Continuous data were presented as means and SEs, 
and categorical variables were shown as numbers and weighted 
percentages. We used the design-adjusted one-way analysis 
of variance and Rao–Scott Pearson χ2 for the comparison 
of continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Plots of 
survival curves were generated using Kaplan–Meier estimates 
and the log-rank test was used for comparing the survival 
distributions among groups. The risks of mortality associated 
with cognitive performance impairment or VI were estimated 
using Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate 
HRs with 95% CIs. All models were ﬁrst adjusted for age, 
gender, ethnicity, and sociodemographic factors (education level, 
marital status, and income status), and then additionally for 
BMI, smoking status, drinking status, hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus, cholesterol level, CRP, history of CVD, and cancer. 
We also evaluated the joint eﬀect of cognitive performance 
impairment and VI on mortality by adjusting for multiple 
covariates. To correct the estimates for non-response, inverse 
probability weighting was used in the sensitivity analyses. 
Sensitivity analyses were also performed after Markov chain 
Monte-Carlo imputations to address the missing data. The 
proportional-hazards assumption for each variable was tested by 
generating time-dependent covariates, with P-value < 0.05 for 
the interaction of the variable and a function of survival time 
regarded as violating the assumption. All variables were found 
to be valid (P > 0.05). All data analyses were performed using 
STATA (ver. 14.0; StataCorp., College Station, TX, United States). 
Two-sided P-values less than 0.05 were considered to indicate 
statistical signiﬁcance. 

A total of 3,234 participants aged 60 years or older participated 
in NHANES (1999/2002). Among these individuals, 684 
were excluded because of missing information on DSST 
score (522 participants) and missing data on visual acuity 
(162 participants), leading to a ﬁnal analytical sample of 2,550 
participants. Compared with participants with complete data, 
participants with incomplete data were older (P < 0.001), 
more likely to be non-Hispanic black (P < 0.001) and be 
unhealthy regarding lifestyle and clinical measures. Other 
baseline characteristics of subjects excluded and included are 
shown in Supplementary Table S1. Among the 2,550 participants 
included in the current analysis, the mean (SE) DSST score 
was 46.9 ± 0.60 points. Table 1 provides basic characteristics 
of participants overall and by quartile of DSST score. The 
mean (SE) age was 70.6 ± 0.29 years, 56.5% of participants 
were women and 84.0% non-Hispanic white. Participants with 
a higher quartile of DSST score were more likely to have 
better vision, be younger, non-Hispanic white people, well 
educated, married or with partner, higher income index, current 
drinker, and healthier in terms of diabetes, hypertension, and 
history of CVD. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in other 
characteristics within quartile of DSST score. Supplementary 
Table S2 illustrates demographic, health-related behaviors, and 
general health characteristics among participants with and 
without VI. Older age, non-white ethnicity, lower education level, 
unmarried status, lower BMI value, hypertension, and history of 
CVD or cancer were signiﬁcantly associated with VI. 
After a median follow-up period of 9.92 years, 952 (35.2%) 
deaths occurred. Of 952 deaths, 239 (23.1%), 224 (24.0%), 
and 489 (52.9%) cases were attributed to CVD, cancer, and 
non-CVD/non-cancer causes, respectively. The comparisons of 
quartiles of DSST score, VI, and baseline characteristics by 
mortality status are shown in Table 2. All-cause mortality 
rates were higher for those participants with a lower quartile 
of DSST score and those with VI. Age- and gender-adjusted 
Cox proportional hazards regression models showed covariates,

including age, gender, education level, marital status, family 
income index, smoking status, diabetes, cholesterol level, CRP 
level, history of CVD, and cancer, were signiﬁcantly associated 
with risks of mortality. After adjusting for multiple variables, 
the Cox models indicated that poorer survival from all-cause, 
CVD, and non-CVD/non-cancer was associated with cognitive 
performance impairment (all cause HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.60–2.47; 
CVD HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.18–2.51; and non-CVD/non-cancer 
HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.70–3.49) (Table 3). Similarly, VI predicted 
increased risk of mortality due to all-cause and non-CVD/non- 
cancer causes in the multifactorial Cox models (all cause HR, 
1.51; 95% CI, 1.16–1.96; and non-CVD/non-cancer HR, 1.75;

performance impairment with VI on mortality. Considering 
participants with neither cognitive performance impairment 
nor VI as the reference group, risk of mortality was increased 
among those with cognitive performance impairment but 
without VI (all-cause HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.50–2.47; CVD HR, 
1.87; 95% CI, 1.22–2.86; cancer HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.71–2.30; and 
non-CVD/non-cancer HR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.57–3.39). However, 
participants with only VI did not show higher risk of mortality. 
Co-presence of VI among cognitively impaired elderly people 
further increased nearly threefold risk of all-cause mortality 
(HR, 2.74; 95% CI, 2.02–3.70) and almost fourfold risk of non- 
CVD/non-cancer mortality (HR, 3.72; 95% CI, 2.30–6.00). We 
observed similar results to those reported in the main analyses 









FIGURE 1 | Kaplan-Meier curve showing all-cause and speciﬁc-cause mortality by cognitive impairment and concomitant VI, using the 1999–2002 NHANES. 
All-cause and speciﬁc-cause mortality were assessed through December 31, 2011. Compared to having neither impairment, co-presence of VI and cognitive 
impairment predicted increased risk of all-cause mortality and non-CVD/non-cancer mortality (A,D), but similar risk of CVD and cancer related mortality (B,C). 
in sensitivity analyses using inverse probability weighting for 
non-response issue (Supplementary Tables S3, S4). After 
imputations of missing values, we also obtained similar results 
(Supplementary Tables S5, S6). 

In a pooled analysis of two nationally representative samples 
(2,550 US subjects aged 60 years and over), we observed that 
both cognitive performance impairment and VI independently 
predicted poorer survival. Additionally, 
the co-presence of 
VI among cognitive impaired elderly predicted higher risk 
of all-cause mortality and of non-CVD/non-cancer mortality 
compared to having neither impairment. 
Visual impairment as a risk factor for cognitive performance 
(Lin et al., 2004; Fischer et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017) in 
the literature was consistent with our result. In addition, the 
ﬁnding that impaired cognitive performance was a signiﬁcant 
predictor of mortality was consistent with previous studies 
(Dewey and Saz, 2001; Perna et al., 2015; Batty et al., 2016; Lee 
et al., 2018). Moreover, a recent systematic literature review also 
supports our results (Dewey and Saz, 2001). In terms of VI, 
our results and those from previous studies suggested that VI 
increased the risk of all-cause mortality (McCarty et al., 2001; 
Wang et al., 2001; Khanna et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2018). In a 
recent meta-analysis, containing 29 prospective cohort studies 
with 269,839 participants and 67,061 deaths, VI was found to 
be signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of mortality in 
participants older than 65 years (Zhang et al., 2016). 

impaired 
cognitive performance accompanied by VI additionally increased 
the risk of mortality in our study, which was in line with a study 
conducted in United States (Liu et al., 2016). On the contrary, 
in a Japanese study, the joint eﬀect of visual and cognitive 
impairment did not increase the risk of mortality compared to 
those without visual/hearing and cognitive impairment, while 
a signiﬁcant increase in risk of mortality was observed among 
individuals with dual 
impairment (visual and hearing) and 
cognitive impairment (Mitoku et al., 2016). Taking into account 
the inclusion of hearing status, self-reported visual function 
and ethnicity in the Japan study might explain the diﬀerent 
results. Of note, even though we observed the signiﬁcant 
association between VI and mortality, the association between 
VI but no impaired cognitive performance and mortality 
did not reach statistical signiﬁcance. This might due to the 
small number of participants in the VI but no impaired 
cognitive performance group (n = 67), which might reduce 
the eﬃciency of statistical analysis and limit the ability of 
detecting the association.

Several possible reasons may account for the joint eﬀect 
of VI and cognitive performance impairment on mortality. 
One possible explanation could be that the VI and cognitive 
impairment contributed additionally to higher possibility of 
disability (Whitson et al., 2007), which has a close relationship 
with mortality (Majer et al., 2011). VI not only increases the risks 
of fractures, falls, and accidents, but also decreases functional 
independence and ability to perform basic and instrumental 
activities in daily life (Keller et al., 1999; DiNuzzo et al., 
2001), and so these factors could adversely aﬀect mortality. 
As well, 
increased risk of falls, accidents, and poor control 
of underlying diseases due to cognitive impairment could also 
reduce survival (Dewey and Saz, 2001; Lievre et al., 2008; 
Muir et al., 2012). Moreover, impaired cognitive performance 
can predict functional status (Kelman et al., 1994), particularly 
motor function, which itself is able to aﬀect mortality (McGuire 
et al., 2006). Another explanation could be underlying vascular 
diseases. In our analysis, both impaired cognitive performance 
and VI were associated with hypertension as well as history 
of CVD, which were signiﬁcantly related to death. A large 
number of studies have described a signiﬁcant relationship 
between cognitive impairment and CVD (Dregan et al., 2013; 
Gottesman et al., 2014). In some cases, cognitive impairment is 
a marker for serious vascular conditions, such as atherosclerosis, 
cerebrovascular disease, and diastolic hypertension (Gale et al., 
1996). Additionally, vision function has also been shown to be 
associated with cardiovascular-related conditions or risk factors 
(Bergman et al., 2004; Klein et al., 2014). The underlying vascular 
dysfunction related to both cognitive and visual health may 
enhance mortality rate. Further studies are warranted to explore 
other possible explanations. 
Relevant public health implications emerge according to our 
ﬁndings. This could inform clinicians that VI and cognitive 
performance impairment are likely to have co-occurrence in 
the elderly and could potentially increase their risks of deaths. 
Although these conditions are not life threatening, they are 
recognized as markers for disability and vulnerability. Therefore, 
neuropsychological tests, combined with vision function tests, 
could be utilized to perform early identiﬁcation to maximize 
the potential impact of preventive interventions. Furthermore, 
rehabilitation of VI in elders, especially among cognitively 
impaired persons, may potentially improve long-term survival. 
Our study included strengths such as a large population-based 
elderly cohort, relatively long follow-up duration, standardized 











objective methods for assessing visual acuity and cognitive 
performance, 
range of demographic 
characteristics, health indicators, comorbidities, and access 
to death records. However, several limitations may limit the 
interpretation of results. First of all, we could not exclude 
the residual confounding variables, such as family functioning 
(Yeh and Liu, 2003; Bambara et al., 2009), which may play 
a role aﬀecting both VI and cognitive performance, although 
many confounding factors have been adjusted for. In addition, 
only baseline measurements of vision function and cognitive 
performance were employed, and no subsequent functional 
changes in vision and cognitive performance were examined. 
Future prospective studies are needed to understand the 
relationship between changes in cognitive or vision status and 
survival over time. Thirdly, participants included in the present 
analysis were younger and healthier regarding lifestyle and 
clinical measures, which might bias the results. Nevertheless, 
we used inverse probability weighting model to adjust for 
non-response and observed similar results. The robustness of 
our conclusions was again veriﬁed after multiple imputation 
for missing data. Last but not least, cognitive function is a 
multidimensional construct that cannot be comprehensively 
evaluated with a single test. However, the DSST is generally 
thought 
to be more sensitive than many other measures, 
especially for milder cognitive impairment. Of note, the DSST 
exercise relies on visual spatial skills. Although we could not 
completely mitigate the eﬀect of VI on cognitive performance in 
the present analysis, the trained interviewer in the NHANES 
provided safeguards to control 
this potential confounding 
eﬀect, including asking participants wear reading glasses when 
necessary, excluding blind participants and those who were 
unable to complete a practice session due to visual, physical, or 
cognitive impairments (NHANES, 1999–2000). Further studies 
exploring joint eﬀects of cognitive function measured by diﬀerent 
tests that are less vision-dependent and visual function on 
mortality are needed to verify the robustness of our results. 

In conclusion, subjects aged 60 years and older with poorer 
cognitive performance are at higher risk of decreased long- 
term survival, and are especially vulnerable to further mortality 
when VI 
is presented. This could inform clinicians that 
early preventive interventions could be exercised to potentially 
improve long-term survival.
