Purpose: To describe predictors of mortality in the 5-year follow-up of the Melbourne Visual Impairment Project (VIP) 
cohort. 
MethodIs: The Melbourne VIP was a population-based study of the distribution and determinants of age-related eye 
disease in a cluster random sample of Melbourne residents aged 40 years and older. Baseline examinations were con- 
ducted between 1992 and 1994. In 1997, 5-year follow-up examinations of the original cohort commenced. Causes of 
death were obtained from the National Death Index for all reported deaths. 
Results: Of the original 3,271 participants, 231 (7.1%) were reported to have died in the intervening 5 years. Of the 
remaining 3,040 participants eligible to return for follow-up examinations, 2,594 (85% of eligible) did participate, 51 
(2%) had moved interstate or overseas, 83 (3%) could not be traced, and 312 (10%) refused to participate. Best cor- 
rected visual acuity <6/12 and cortical cataract were associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality, as were 
increasing age, male sex, increased duration of cigarette smoking, increased duiration of hypertension, and arthritis. 



A number of studies have shown an association between 
age-related eye conditions and increased mortality. 1-12 In 
particular, it has been suggested that cataract, especially 
nuclear cataract, or cataract surgery may be markers for 
aging. In the Beaver Dam Eye Study, people with visual 
acuity of <6/12 were 1.57 times as likely to die in the fol- 
lowing 5 years than those with better vision.9 
The Melbourne Visual Impairment Project (VIP) was 
a population-based study of the distribution and determi- 
nants of age-related eye disease in a representative sample 
of Melbourne residents aged 40 years and older. Baseline 
examinations were conducted between 1992 and 1994. 
We have shown previously that the 83% of eligible resi- 
dents who chose to participate did not differ significantly 
in any factors that would likely lead to a bias in the estimate

of prevalence estimates.'3 In 1997, 5-year follow-up exam- 
inations were commenced to determine the incidence of 
age-related eye conditions and risk factors associated with 
those eye diseases in the Melbourne VIP cohort. 
The purpose of this study was to identify the predic- 
tors of 5-year mortality in our cohort of noninstitutional- 
ized adults. 

Details of the methodology employed for the baseline 
Melbourne VIP examinations have been published previ- 
ously.'4 Briefly, cluster random sampling was employed to 
identify 9 pairs of census collector districts in the 
Melbourne Statistical Division from which to recruit eligi- 
ble residents. Eligible adults were defined as people aged 
40 years and older who had been residents in their homes 
for at least 6 months. A household census was conducted 
to identify the eligible residents, collect basic demograph- 
ic information, and invite the eligible residents to attend 
the local examination centers. The standardized examina- 
tions lasted approximately 90 minutes and included pre- 
senting and best corrected visual acuity, reading vision, 
Humphrey visual fields, intraocular pressure, personal 
health and health-related 
habits interview, clinical 
ophthalmic examination, and photography of the lens and 



fundus. The Wilmer lens grading scheme was used,'5 and 
cataract was defined as 
>4/16 cortical opacity, . 2.0 
nuclear standard, or .1 mm2 posterior subcapsular opaci- 
ty. Glaucoma diagnosis was determined by a consensus of 
glaucoma experts after review of intraocular pressure, 
visual fields, and optic discs.6 Age-related maculopathy 
was graded from fundus photos according to the interna- 
tional classification system.'7 The protocol was approved 
by the Human Research and Ethics Committee at the 
Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital.

information about some of the baseline results and alerted 
participants to the fact that 5-year follow-up examinations 
would commence in 1997. Prior to the commencement of 
the 5-year follow-up examinations at each of the 9 test sites, 
information sessions were held to again inform the partici- 
pants of the baseline results and to tell them what to expect

tacted each of the original participants to organize conven- 
ient appointment times for them, including nights and 
weekends when necessary. Information about contact peo- 
ple that was provided by the participants at baseline was 
used to locate people who had moved and to identify those 
people who had died in the intervening 5 years. If neces- 
sary, people were examined in their homes or nursing 
homes. Interpreters were provided if needed. 
Causes of death were obtained from the National 
Death Index, which is maintained by the Australian 
Institute for Health and Welfare in Canberra. This organ- 
ization provides a list of causes of death for individuals 
who are matched by name, year of birth, and year of 
death. The matches are given a probability of being the 
same person. 
Interview data were entered directly into a Paradox 
computer package with consistency checks built in. 
All

other data were entered twice and verified. 
analyses were conducted with SAS version 6.0. Pearson 
chi-square analyses were used to identify univariate pre- 
dictors of participation and mortality for categorical vari- 
ables, and Mantel-Haenszel chi-square analyses were 
used for ordinal variables. Stepwise multivariate logistic 
regression analyses were used to identify independent 
predictors of participation and 5-year mortality. Survival 
analyses were conducted with the Wilcoxon test for statis- 
tical significance of the survival curves. A P value of less 
than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. 

At baseline, the VIP cohort was 54% female and ranged in 
age from 40 to 98 years, with a mean of 59 years. Of the 
original 3,271 participants, 231 (7.1%) were reported to 
have died in the intervening 5 years (Fig 1). Forty-nine 
(21%) of the deaths could not be confirmed from the 
National Death Index. Country of birth was significantly 
related to confirmation of death by the death registry. 
The percent of deaths confirmed by the death registry 
varied by country of birth: 90% for Italy, 86% for 
Australia, 78% for Great Britain, 74% for others, and 29% 
for Greece (x2 = 4; df = 27.2, P = .001). The people 
whose deaths were confirmed by the death registry were 
not significantly different from those who deaths were not 
confirmed by the death registry in terms of age, sex, cor- 
tical cataract, nuclear cataract, posterior subcapsular

cataract, cataract surgery, age-related maculopathy, glau- 
coma, diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, gout, or 
cardiovascular disease (all P >.10, data not presented). 
Of the remaining 3,040 participants eligible to return 
for follow-up examinations, 2,594 (85% of eligible) did 
participate, 51 (2%) had moved interstate or overseas, 83 
(3%) could not be traced, and 312 (10%) refused to par- 
ticipate. The time between baseline and follow-up exam- 
inations ranged from 4 to 7 years (mean, 4.5 years, 
SD=0.64, median, 4 years). The mean age of the partici- 
pants at follow-up was 62.5 years (SD=10.9, range, 44 to 
101), and 1,421 (55%) were female. 
Factors significantly related to participation at follow- 
up in the 3,040 eligible residents were identified (Table I). 
Male or female sex was not significantly related to partic- 
ipation, even at the univariate level (data not presented). 
The vision-related outcomes, such as cataract and glauco- 
ma, were also not significantly related to participation. 
The only factors related to participation that remained in 
the multivariate model were age, country of birth, and 
Non-English speakers and 
language spoken at home. 
people born in Greece, Malta, or Cyprus were significant- 
ly less likely to participate. Age only just reached statisti- 
cal significance in the multivariate model (P=.04), and all 
of the 10-year age-groups had participation rates of at 
least 83%. 
Predictors of mortality were evaluated in the cohort 
(Table II). Increasing age, male sex, increased duration of 
cigarette smoking, increased duration of high blood pres- 
sure, arthritis, best corrected visual acuity of <6/12, and 
cortical cataract were all associated with a significantly 
increased risk of death. 
Life table analyses were conducted to explore further 
the relationship between decreased visual acuity and mor- 
tality (Fig 2). Although not statistically significant over 
the time period because of the relatively small number of 
deaths at each time point, the probability of survival at 
each time point was less for people with best corrected 
visual acuity of <6/12 (c2=1.59, P=.21). These analyses 
were adjusted for age and sex. 
The potential relationship between other levels of 
vision impairment (<6/6, <6/9, <6/18, <6/60) and mortali- 
ty was investigated to determine if a linear trend was evi- 
dent. Although all levels of visual acuity <6/6 were asso- 
ciated with an increased 5-year mortality, only the visual 
acuity category of <6/6 to .6/9 was statistically significant. 
The potential relationship between cataract and mortality 
was investigated further by using a more conservative and 
a more lenient definition of cortical and nuclear cataract. 
In none of the 4 additional multivariate analyses was 
cataract significantly related to mortality (data not pre- 
sented).

We found that decreased visual acuity was associated with 
increased 5-year mortality. 
This is consistent with the 
findings of a study reported in 19662 and with the univari- 
ate findings of the Beaver Dam Eye Study.9 It is plausible 
that people with vision impairment have increased mor- 
tality rates for a number of reasons. 
Researchers have 
shown previously that people with vision impairment are 
significantly more likely to use healthcare services,'8"9 3 
times more likely to use regular support services provided 
by the municipality,20 and 6 times more likely to be unable 
to go out alone.20 Additionally, poorer visual function is 
associated with increased falls,2' and decreased visual acu- 
ity is associated with an increased risk of car accidents.U 
All of these factors could lead to increased mortality rates 
in people with vision impairment. 
Several studies have found a positive association 
between nuclear opacities and mortality,8'",13 particularly 
in people with diabetes.5"0"3 These researchers have spec- 
ulated that lens opacities are a biologic marker for aging. 
We did not find an association between nuclear cataract 
and mortality. However, we did find that people with cor- 
tical cataract as defined in our study were nearly 1.5 times 
more likely to die during the 5 years. The relationship 
may be artefactual, since we did not find an association 
between cortical cataract and mortality when we used a 
more lenient and a more conservative definition of corti- 
cal cataract. 
A number of studies have also found increased mor- 
tality rates among people who have undergone cataract 
extraction.4'6'7"0"1 Although we find an increased mortality 
rate in univariate analyses for people who had undergone 
cataract surgery, this finding was not statistically signifi- 
cant in our multivariate analyses. 



A study reported in the 1960s showed an association 
A stud 
between glaucoma and age-specific mortality.2 No such 
association between glaucoma and mortality was seen in 
the more recently conducted Beaver Dam Eye 
Study.9More recently, high intraocular pressure and glau- 
coma treatment were found to predict decreased life 
expectancy in the Framingham Eye Study cohort.'2 We 
did not find a relationship between glaucoma or intraocu- 
lar pressure and mortality in multivariate analyses. 

In the over-65-year age cohort, there is evidence of a 
j-shaped curve for the relationship between alcohol con- 
sumption and mortality, with moderate levels of alcohol 
consumption protective for mortality and larger amounts 
of alcohol a risk for increased mortality. 
This j- or u- 
risk 
s 
shaped curve for alcohol consumption and mortality risk 
has been demonstrated previously.U 
Smoking is a well-known risk factor for mortality and 
has also been shown to be related to the prevalence and 
incidence of a number of ocular disorders, including age- 
related macular degeration24 and nuclear cataract.' We 
found in our study that there was a linear trend between 
pack-years of smoking and mortality. 

The strengths of the Melbourne VIP include the sam- 
pling strategy and the high response rate, which ensure 
that the study population is representative of Melbourne 
residents aged 40 years and older. The only factors found 
to be associated with nonparticipation by eligible resi- 
dents in the 5-year follow-up examinations were country 
of birth and language spoken at home. Greeks were sig- 
nificantly less likely to participate, although their response 
rate is similar to what has been reported for the overall 
follow-up rate in a couple of other large epidemiologic 
studies of eye disease (the Chesapeake Bay Watermen 
Study and the Baltimore Eye Survey). Not only were the 
Greeks less likely to participate, but it was also less likely 
that their deaths could be confirmed on the death registry. 
It is possible that the Greek-born participants returned to 
Greece to die or that their relatives said that they were 
dead as an excuse for them not to participate. 



We have shown that decreased visual acuity is associated 
with the largest odds ratio for increased mortality in our 
cohort, even greater than age. Further research is need- 
ed to explore why people with decreased vision or cataract 
have a higher mortality rate.

It is an ancient observation 
DR BARBARA E. K. KLEIN. 
that blindness is a harbinger of death. This is in large part 
because of the relationship of age to decreased visual 
function. In the Beaver Dam Eye Study, for example, 
severe visual impairment was found in 2.0% of those 75 
years of age or older compared to 0.1% of those 43-54 
years of age.' However, in the data reported by Taylor et 
al. from the Melbourne Visual Impairment Project (VIP), 
in the Beaver Dam Eye Study cohort and in other studies, 
visual impairment is a predictor of death even when com- 
paring people of similar ages. The estimated risk differs 
between studies. This may reflect differences in popula- 
tions, in techniques used to assess best corrected acuity, in 
participation rates, etc. The importance of the finding is 
not the differences between studies but the consistency of 
finding that visual function predicts survival. 
Dr. Taylor suggests that increased falls and automobile 
accidents may lead to increased mortality in those with 
impaired vision. In Beaver Dam, we found significant asso- 
ciations between several performance-based measures of 
visual function and falls and fractures, as well as time to 
walk a measured course.- Table 1 indicates the relationships 
of falls and hip fractures to best corrected acuity, near acu- 
ity, and contrast sensitivity in those 60 years of age or older. 
For the 2 high contrast measures, the relationships are sig- 
nificant. For contrast sensitivity, the relationship is of bor- 
derline significance for falls. Also, time to walk a measured 
course (gait time) was correlated with the visual function 
measures (Table 2). These findings confirm the notion that 
visual function is associated with characteristics related to 
mobility. While it is not far fetched to interpret these find- 
ings as representing a causal relationship of decreased visu- 
al function to subsequent falls, auto accidents, fractures, 
slower gait, and even mortality, it is more likely that in most 
instances all these factors including poorer visual function 
are indicators of greater frailty, and hence of greater proba- 
bility of death. In support of this, when considering visual 
impairment in the Beaver Dam data, if one controls not only 
for age and sex, but also considers presence of proteinuria,

diuretic use, history of cancer, diastolic blood pressure, 
ratio of total to HDL-cholesterol, smoking status, pulse 
rate, diabetes status, body mass index, history of cardiovas- 
cular disease, and lifestyle (sedentary), visual impairment is 
no longer a significant variable. This implies that other fac- 
tors than visual function are related to death and that once 
these are considered, visual function status does not add to 
our statistical ability to predict death. It is interesting to 
note that in the Melbourne VIP and other studies,3.-2 the 
presence of lens opacities or cataract surgery were related 
to decreased survival. In Beaver Dam, after controlling for 
the myriad of factors I listed before, the severity of nuclear 


sclerosis was associated with decreased survival, although 
the relationship was of borderline statistical significance 
(Table 3). It has been postulated that severity of nuclear 
sclerosis may be a good biologic marker of aging. In fact, 
when the age of non-human primates is not known, 
researchers ma'v approximate it by examining the lens (PL 
Kaufinan; Personal Communication). Cataracts may occur 
as part of systemic conditions of prematuire aging such as 
Werner's syndrome in humans'3", and in specific strains of 
some animal species. In population-based data where age- 
related cataracts are common, there is data to suggest that 
familial aggregation is significant."5," Thus, while the time 
course of development of cataract may be the result of 
accumulated exposure to systemic and environmental fac- 
tors associated with increasing age, a complementary 
hypothesis is that there are genetic determinants of physio- 
logic aging as well, and cataract may be a more specific 
marker of this than visual acuity. 
It has been said before that the eye is a window on the 
body, if not the soul. Indeed, examining the retina reveals 
important information about systemic vascular, infectious, 
congenital, and even trauma occurring at primary sites 
other than the visual system. However, we need an instru- 
ment finer than the Hermann von Helmhotz ophthalmo- 
scope to fully reveal all the plethora of information about 
the very essence of survival that is manifest in the eye and 
visual function.

DR GEORGE L. SPAETH. A comment: There is hardly a day 
that somebody doesn't say "well, the person is 90 years 
old. You are not going to treat the person for glaucoma, 
are you?" It is always given in terms of years, never in 
terms of life expectancy. The comment relates to that fas- 
cinating table that Dr Taylor showed us, about relation- 
ship between age and life expectancy. He chose the "half 
empty" aspect, saying "only 50% are going to live 5 years." 
He could equally choose the "half full" aspect, and say "Of 
all the patients who are 90 years old, 50% are going to live 
for more than 5 years." It is so important we remember 
always that we are treating individuals, not populations. 
DR FREDRICK L. FERRIS. I think that Dr Taylor has done 
and excellent job of reminding us that visual function may 
be at least a marker for mortality, and this has been seen 
in multiple studies. However, observational studies, such 
as his, are not well equipped to identify cause and effect, 
and as Dr Klein has just mentioned, for example, lesions 
such as lens opacities which may be markers of physiolog- 
ic age, may well lead to the results that were seen by Dr 
Taylor. I think that Dr Klein also mentioned the possibil- 
ity of concurrent disease. For example, diabetes leads to 
vision loss. People with diabetes and vision loss have very 
increased rates of mortality. 
Finally, there may be other markers. Even not seek- 
ing medical care for glasses might be a marker leading to 
increased mortality. Some of Dr Taylor's patients may 
well have had decreased vision, not because it could not 
be corrected, but because they did not seek the care nec- 
essary to correct it, and that they may well be a marker of 
other care that they should seek but do not. So perhaps 
the message is that fixing their vision may not keep them 
alive by itself, but it may be a marker of someone who is 
at increased risk and perhaps needs increased care. 
DR RICHARD P. MILLS. My point is similiar to that of Dr 
Ferris, that particularly in this youngest cohort that Dr 
Taylor reported, in which there was the strongest 
association for visual acuity less than 20/40 and mortality, 

were these people primarily Type I diabetics who, of 
course, are likeliest to die of cardiovascular disease, the 
commonest cause of death? Is the data rich enough to, for 
example to list diabetes as a tertiary cause of death, where 
you might be able to develop some cause-effect relation- 
ship? 
Dr Malcolm R. Ing. Hugh I really enjoyed your paper. 
What was a little surprising was the lack of correlation 
between macular degeneration and the risk of mortality. 
Two recent articles in the Archives of Ophthalmology 
have brought out 2 very important and interesting find- 
ings. One was that high fat diet was associated with mac- 
ular degeneration; the other was lack of fish, (or, inverse- 
I 
ly, more fish in the diet, less macular degeneration). 
fully expected to hear that macular degeneration was asso- 
ciated with increased mortality. 
So, let us jump 1 step forward and say is the cortical 
cataract, since that was one marker that did come out of 
your study, related to the other 2 entities; that is higher fat 
in a diet and lack of fish. Both of those have been associ- 
ated with shorter longevity, as far as I knov, in public 
health studies. 
DR HUGiu TAYLOR. Thank you Dr Anderson, and I would 
like to thank Dr Barbara Klein and the other discussants 
for the very interesting and important points that they 
raised. 
Dr Klein speculated on the possible mechanisms of 
death in people visually impaired and their data on falls 
and fractures I think is of great importance. But also there 
are increasing data coming to indicate that people who 
have visual impairment suffer from a number of other 
problems. Depression particularly is surprisingly common 
when one looks through the information coming from 
quality of life questionnaires, of which now there are quite 
a number. Depression always comes up much more fre- 
quently in people with visual impairment, and depression 
itself is a well recognised risk for decreased mortality. 
There are also some indications that self-care prac- 
tices are quite different in people who are visually 
impaired. As Dr Ferris suggested, not only are people 
who have visual impairment less likely to access medical 
services for their eyes on the one hand and for their gen- 
eral health on the other, but also people who have visual 
impairment have increased difficulty with medication, 
with monitoring their blood sugar if they happen to have 
diabetes, and also with managment of minor health prob- 
lems, cuts and scratches, their podiatry will be less metic- 
ulous, and so on. But I think there are some very inter- 
esting questions that have not yet been addressed as to 
what mechanisms of death may be operating in these peo- 
ple. That relates also to the question brought up by Dr 
Mills. Are we seeing cause or effect here? 
This is a population-based study. The ratio between 
Type I and Type II diabetes was about 5% for Type I and 
about 95% were Type II or adult onset diabetes. I cannot 
remeInber the number of people who had diabetes who 
died who were in the age group 40-59. If it were 1 or 2, 
then we just would not have the statistical power to ask 
the question raised by Dr Mills. 
Clearly, we need to consider the dramatic changes 
that are occurring in our population structure, as alluded 
to by Dr Spaeth, and I am very happy to look at the glass 
being half full, as he said, rather than half empty. One 
hundred years ago, the life expectancy in America and in 
At the end of the 
Australia was about 40 or 45 years. 
Second World War, in 1950, the life expectancy had 
increased to about 60 years. Now, life expectancy is about 
80 years, so that for every year that we have lived, we have 
gained about 4 months of life for free, as that increasing 
life expectancy has increased dramatically over the last 
century. 
Now in the next 20 years, the population of the US 
will increase about 20%. But the number of people over 
the age of 65 will double. There will be a huge increase 
in this older people with greying of the population, With 
the doubling in the older population, there will be twice 
as many people requiring cataract surgery, twice as many 
people requiring glaucoma surgery. But only 20% more

expectancy in people who have reached the age of 40 now, 
two-thirds of them can expect to reach the age of 90. This 
is dramatically different from the figures that were oper- 
ating 50 or 100 years ago. Let me repeat that two-thirds 
of people who have reached the age of 40 now can expect 
to reach the age of 90. 
Finally, to answer Malcolm Ing's question on the role 
of fat diet and antioxidants. In our cross-sectional obser- 
vational study, we do not have the ability to address those 
questions, other than to say that we did not find a rela- 
tionship with macular degeneration and decreased 
longevity when we controlled for age and other factors. 
There are studies at the moment, such as AREDS study 
run by the National Eye Institute, and the VECAT study, 
a study we are conducting in Australia, looking at the spe- 
cific effect of antioxidants on both cataract and macular 
degeneration, and I think that this is a very important area 
for further research and should answer the question 
raised by Dr Ing. Thank you.
