Purpose: To evaluate the association between visual acuity (VA) and 4-year mortality in an older 
population-based cohort. 
Methods: Five thousand and fifty-seven persons aged 50 to 96 years (91.0% of the eligible popula- 
tion) residents of the Southern Harbin, Heilongjiang Provence, China participated in the study. At 
baseline (2006), the main ocular diseases were diagnosed from a basic ocular examination including 
presenting and best-corrected VA. Of the 5,057 participants in the baseline survey, those who died 
after the study were identified and the death certificate was checked. The physicians in charge of 
the health of the village population were asked for the presumed cause of death. The rate of death 
was determined in the follow-up survey in 2010. We evaluated the association of visual impairment 
(VI) and mortality using multiple logistic regression. 
Results: Between the baseline examination and the censoring cutpoint study, a total of 214 subjects 
(4.2%) were dead. Females with VI were less likely to have died relative to male gender with VI 
(P < 0.05). Compared with participants who reported better presenting VA (VA ≥ 20/60), the risk of 
mortality was significantly higher for those reporting moderate VI (20/400 ≤ VA < 20/60) (Odds 
Ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI],1–4.1) and those reporting severe VI (VA < 20/400) 
(OR,3.6; 95% CI, 2.0–6.6). Similar associations were obtained for best-corrected VA in the better eye 
(OR, 3.1; 95% CI: 1.5–6.4 and 3.9; 95%CI: 2.1–7.2, respectively). 
Conclusion: In this Chinese population-based cohort we found that visual impairment predicted a 
significantly elevated mortality. 


Previous studies have consistently shown an 
associationbetween visual acuity (VA) and increased 
 
mortality in older population.1–4 Because higher age 
is the major risk factor for mortality, the major age-

related ocular diseases such as cataract, glaucoma, and 
macular degeneration, also are related to increased 
mortality if, in a univariate analysis, age and other 
confounding factors are not taken into account.5–10 
In the Beijing Eye Study, a population-based cohort 
survey showed that subcapsular posterior cataract 
predicted a significantly elevated mortality.11 Data col- 
lected in the National Health Interview Survey from 
1986 through 1994 documented an approximate 50% 
increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mor- 
tality among patients with glaucoma.12 In contrast, 
more recent population-based studies did not find 


any association between glaucoma and mortality after 
follow-up periods of either 5 or 10 years.13,14 Retinal 
vein occlusions, and visual impairment (VI) may have 
increased mortality.15–1 7 
Nevertheless, most of the studies were focused 
only on an individual disease. We aimed to assess the 
multivariate relationships between mortality and the 
visual impairment in a population-based investigation 
of adults aged 50 to 96 years at baseline residing in 
China. The study was conducted in rural population 
where the lifestyle and environment may be different. 
This area was selected for study to represent the typical 
environmental region. This area is characterized by a 
cold weather (average 4.5°C yearly), lower elevation 
(around 200 meters), farming communities, and plains. 
This study provides vital epidemiological data on the 
relationship between visual impairment and mortality 
in this environment. 

The Southern Harbin Eye Study (SHES) surveyed vision 
and eye disease in population aged 50 to 96 years from 
a rural area south of Harbin, China. Sampling design 
and participant eligibility criteria and methods used to 
conduct the study have been previously described.10,18,19 
Briefly, a county was selected to be the survey loca- 
tion, with approximately 640,000 people living in rural 
areas in 2005. The investigation followed the tenets of 
the Declaration of Helsinki and the approval of the 
Health Department, Heilongjiang Province, China, was 
obtained. Verbal consent from subjects was obtained 
before examination with the nature of the examina- 
tion and participant rights explained by the registrars. 
People with an eye complaint were referred to the 
county hospital for treatment. 

The designated ophthalmologists provided training to 
the epidemic prevention doctors at individual Xiang 
clinics. Upon training, these Xiang doctors went to 
every household in the selected village, recording 
everyone 50 years old and over, obtaining basic infor- 
mation, including age, gender, home ownership, and 
self-rated health. Participants were asked whether they 
had hypertension, diabetes, a heart attack, angina, 
stroke, or cancer history. Hypertension was defined 
as a self-reported history of physician diagnosis 
or subjects who were receiving drug treatment for 
hypertension. Diabetes was diagnosed from history 
or from an elevated fasting venous blood glucose of 
7.0mmol/L (140mg%) or more. Detailed histories of 



current smoking and alcohol consumption also were 
recorded. 
baseline eye examination and diagnosis of the 
main ocular diseases 
At the time of the first survey in 2006, 21 clusters 
were randomly selected units. The selected clusters 
ranged in population from 756 to 1,452, with an 
estimated 2005 census population of 23,025. Within 
the 21 clusters selected for this study, a total of 5,057 
individuals aged 50 years and above underwent VA 
testing and a basic eye examination out of 5,559 enu- 
merated people resulting in an overall response rate 
of 91.0%. We could not examine 502 of the enumer- 
ated people, including 325 people who were tem- 
porarily unavailable despite repeated visits on the 
day of examination and 177 people who refused to 
participate. Non-participation and participation did 
not differ with regard to age (P > 0.05) or education 
(P > 0.05),but a greater proportion of females (52.9%) 
among participants compared with non-participants 
(33.6%) (P < 0.001). 
The clinical eye examinations were conducted 
by two different teams, consisting of seven ophthal- 
mologists each. Those physically unable to attend the 
examination site were offered the ocular examination 
at home. 
A logarithmic visual acuity chart (Precision Vision, 
LaSalle, IL, USA) was used to measure VA. Visual 
acuity was measured for each eye. The smallest line 
read with one or no errors at 4 m using 5 tumbling-E 
letters in each row was recorded. If no letters from the 
chart could be identified, VA was determined by count- 
ing fingers, hand movements, light perception, or no 
light perception. Refraction error was measured using 
an auto refractometer (Topcon Corporation, Model 
RM-8000B, Tokyo, Japan), and the appropriate spec- 
tacle correction used in determining VA. All subjects 
received a basic ocular examination including exter- 
nal appearance of the eye, examination of the anterior 
chamber and lens with a slit-lamp biomicroscope, and 
examination of the fundus by direct ophthalmoscopy. 
Blindness (severe VI) was defined as presenting VA 
worse than 20/400. Moderate visual impairment was 
defined as presenting VA worse than 20/60 but equal 
to or better than 20/400. Unilateral visual impairment 
was defined as visual impairment in one eye but 20/60 
or better in the other eye. 
Cataract blindness was defined as the sum of both 
unoperated and operated cataract blind individuals. 
Because it is not possible to retrospectively determine 
the preoperative status of a patient with cataract, the 
following guideline was obeyed: For those operated 


on in both eyes, it was assumed that the individual 
was an abilaterally cataract blind patient, whereas uni- 
laterally operated on patients were assumed to have 
been bilaterally blind at the time of surgery only if the 
unoperated on fellow eye was currently blind. VA < 
20/400 was used as the definition of blindness in the 
cataract blindness burden analyses. 
In the baseline survey, cataract was the dominant 
cause of bilateral visual impairment (55.4%), blind- 
ness (70.4%) and unilateral blindness (46.7%). Corneal 
opacity was another leading cause of unilateral (16.4%) 
and bilateral (8.2%) blindness. Refractive error and 
cataract were the main causes of unilateral (35.9%, 
35.7%) visual impairment, followed by AMD (8.4%); 
While glaucoma was an important cause of unilateral 
(5.7%) and bilateral (5.1%) blindness, but not visual 
impairment. 
telephone contact with the former participants or their 
relatives. 

We used the presenting and best-corrected VA from 
better-seeing eye to define visual impairment. To 
evaluate the association of VA and mortality, we 
estimated ORs and 95% Cls for all-cause mortality 
and sex- specific all-cause mortality using Multiple 
logistic regression for stratified presenting VA groups 
(VA < 20/400, 20/400 ≤ VA < 20/60, VA ≥ 20/60). Plots 
of all-cause mortality curve stratified by group were 
generated by the SigmaPlot 11 method. The data 
were analyzed by the SPSS 15 software for Windows 
(Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Chicago, 
IL, USA). 

Of the 5,057 participants in the baseline survey, those 
who died after the population-based study were iden- 
tified and the death certificate was checked. The cause 
of death was determined by the physicians in charge 
of health of the village population. Those who had 
moved to the other area after the population-based 
study were assessed about the health status and 
death for 135 of the 228 participants (59.2%) by direct 

Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of 
the examined subjects are displayed in Table 1. The 
subjects age 50 years and older in the selected clus- 
ters made up 27.3% of the population, and the mean 
age was 60.5 ± 17.5 (range 50–96) years. The average 
age of female was 60.4 years versus 60.7 years among 
males. Females were less educated than males. Subjects

with better acuity were more likely to have died relative 
to male gender with no VI (3.9% vs. 3.6%) (Figure 1); 
however, females with presenting VI were less likely to 
have died relative to males with VI. There is a signifi- 
cant (P < 0.05) interaction between sex and categories of 
presenting VA. Because of this interaction, all mortality 
analyses were completed separately among male and 
female participants. 
Sex-specific data of ORs and corresponding 95% 
CIs for death from all-causes mortality are shown in 
Table 3. Compared with participants who reported 
better presenting VA (VA ≥ 20/60), the risk of mortal- 
ity was significantly higher for those reporting mod- 
erate VI (20/400 ≤ VA < 20/60) and those reporting 
severe VI (VA < 20/400), although, in both cases, 
these associations were stronger among men than 
women. The prevalence of all-cause mortality in 












age 50–59 were more likely to be examined (n = 2,805, 
55.5%). In the follow-up visit, 4,964 individuals (98.2%) 
were enumerated and 93 individuals were not checked 
due to moving away. 
During an average 4-year period, cerebrovascu- 
lar (CVA) events were the most common cause of 
death (n = 75; 35.0%), followed by heart disorders 
(n = 63; 29.4%), malignancies (n = 41; 19.2%), and 
other causes (n = 16; 7.5%) such as nonmalignant lung 
diseases (n = 2), diabetes (n = 3), injury (n = 2), liver 
(n = 4), and kidney (n = 3) problems. Data on mortal- 
ity or cause of death were missing for 5 participants 
(2.3%). The most frequent causes of presenting VI 
in the dead subjects were cataract (40.9%), refractive 
error (33.3%), and macular degeneration (16.7%). The 
percentile of diabetic retinopathy was only 3.0% in 
the dead cases. 
Between the baseline examination and the censor- 
ing cutpoint study, a total of 214 subjects (4.2%) were 
dead. One hundred sixty one deaths among the 4,300 
subjects (3.7%) with VA ≥ 20/60 were recorded. Forty 
deaths among the 651 subjects (6.1%) with 20/400 ≤ 
VA < 20/60, and 13 deaths among 106 subjects (12.3%) 
with VA < 20/400 were recorded. 
All-cause mortality by better-eye presenting VA 
is shown in Table 2. Poorer presenting VA categories 
were associated strongly with mortality. Persons with 
moderate (20/400 ≤ VA < 20/60) and severe (VA < 
20/400) reduction in presenting VA had poorer sur- 
vival compared with persons with better vision (VA ≥ 
20/60; P < 0.05, OR: 3.6 [95%CI: 2.0–6.6]). 
Table 2 also shows results for all-cause mortality by 
better-eye best-corrected VA. As compared with partic- 
ipants with best- corrected VA of ≥ 20/60, participants 
with moderate and severe reduction had a OR of 3.1 
(95%CI: 1.5–6.4) and 3.9 (95%CI:2.1–7.2), respectively 
(P < 0.001). 
An examination of interactions between covariates 
and visual status revealed sex-specific differences in 
mortality across categories of presenting VA. Females

Results of our analyses showed that presenting visual 
impairment significantly predicted higher all-cause 
mortality in this population- based study of older adults, 
among individuals 50 years and older. We showed that 
subjects with presenting VA worse than 20/400 had a 
3.6-fold higher risk of death as compared with subjects 
with better vision (VA ≥ 20/60), independent of other 
predictors of mortality. Several mechanisms account 
for the associations between VI and mortality. These 
mechanisms include the following: (1) adverse treat- 
ment effects for eye diseases, (2) exposure to factors 
known to increase the risk of these conditions and major 
cause-specific deaths, (3) aging, and (4) impaired psy- 
chological functioning.20 Visual impairment is related to 
functional disability.21,22 Loss of independence, need for 
community support, and reduced social interaction and 
depression.23 Depression has been reported to predict 
cardiovascular mortality.24 All the results are similar to 
findings from other population-based studies that have 
been documented (Table 4). 
In agreement with previous study,28 relationships 
between categories of VA and mortality were stronger 

in men in our study. In this study, the prevalence of 
all-cause mortality in male (15.6%) was higher than 
that in female gender (10.8%) (P < 0.05). The exact 
mechanism is unclear. Basically, women live longer 
and have a better chance of development of eye and 
other age-related comorbid conditions, whereas men 
die earlier in life and are more likely to have fewer 
comorbid conditions. Therefore, it is possible that 
other variables are more likely to confound a relation- 
ship between eye disease and mortality in women than 
in men. However, other eye studies,29,30 have reported 
larger mortality risk estimates in female compared 
with male gender. A recent study from Atherosclerosis 
Risk in Communities showed that retinal arteriolar 
narrowing is related to risk of coronary heart disease 
in women.31 Further research is needed to identify the 
associations between VI and mortality in male and 
female gender. 
We chose to use presenting VA because we 
hypothesized that a person’s actual acuity would 
affect mortality through intervening factors such 
as accidents,32 psychological health,33 and quality 
of life,34 which may be responsible in part for poor 
survival among persons with visual impairment.35 It 
is possible that presenting VA reflects a person’s daily 
level of visual comfort. In our study, only 29 par- 
ticipants (2.2%) presented spectacle.36 The predictive 
value of presenting VA for mortality was somewhat

stronger than for best-corrected VA.27 However, our 
results were similar when we used best-corrected VA 
and the best-corrected VA was statistically significant 
related to mortality. 
Although the findings are similar to other studies, 
this does not indicate the association between VI and 
mortality is independent of urban/rural lifestyle. It 
has been proved that diabetes would correlate with 
a higher rate of cardiovascular disease and CVA.37,38 
With respect to the ocular parameter of diabetic retin- 
opathy, the present survey is different from previous 
population-based studies such as the Tanjong Pagar 
Study, the Beaver Dam Study, and the Beijing Study 
in which this disease was correlated with an increased 
risk of mortality.15,16,27,39 There are only three subjects 
who died from diabetes in our study and the percen- 
tile of diabetic retinopathy was only 3.0% in the dead 
cases. Maybe the rural lifestyle and/or ethnic groups 
account for the results. 
The Southern Harbin Eye Study has many strengths 
for investigating the relationship of VA and mortality 
including its population-based sample with high par- 
ticipation, long-term follow-up, and use of standard- 
ized procedures. Limitations include the likelihood 
that some important confounding factors may not 
have been controlled for and some associations may be 
due to a chance finding. We cannot exclude the possi- 
bility that some of the associations may be false. To the 
best of our knowledge, no data show an association 
between VA and mortality in China. In this study, we 
examined the relationship between VA and mortality 
in a population-based cohort of rural Chinese adults 
aged 50 to 96 years at baseline residing in China. 
Based on the observation, we hypothesize that visual 
impairment may be an important marker for mortality 
in the study. If the hypothesis is confirmed, a longer 
duration of follow-up for this population may provide 
more precise estimates of these associations.
