We investigated the relationship of visual impairment (VI) and age-related eye diseases with 
mortality in a prospective, population-based cohort study of 3,280 Malay adults aged 40–80 years 
between 2004–2006. Participants underwent a full ophthalmic examination and standardized lens 
and fundus photographic grading. Visual acuity was measured using logMAR chart. VI was defined 
as presenting (PVA) and best-corrected (BCVA) visual acuity worse than 0.30 logMAR in the better- 
seeing eye. Participants were linked with mortality records until 2012. During follow-up (median 7.24 
years), 398 (12.2%) persons died. In Cox proportional-hazards models adjusting for relevant factors, 
participants with VI (PVA) had higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio[HR], 1.57; 95% confidence 
interval[CI], 1.25–1.96) and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality (HR 1.75; 95% CI, 1.24–2.49) than 
participants without. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) was associated with increased all-cause (HR 1.70; 
95% CI, 1.25–2.36) and CVD mortality (HR 1.57; 95% CI, 1.05–2.43). Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) was 
associated with increased CVD mortality (HR 3.14; 95% CI, 1.26–7.73). No significant associations 
were observed between cataract, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration with mortality. We 
conclude that persons with VI were more likely to die than persons without. DR and RVO are markers 
of CVD mortality. 
With aging populations, age–related eye diseases and visual impairment (VI) pose substantial public 
health issues1. VI can lead to functional disability2–4, loss of independence5, reduced social interaction, 
depression6, accidents7, falls8 and fractures9. In addition, as visual acuity is a reflection of one’s functional 
status and ocular health, the presence of VI may also be a marker of frailty and may hence predict mor- 
tality10. Several population-based studies have shown a possible link between VI with increased mortal- 
ity11–19. However, there have only been few studies in Asian populations20–22, who have different patterns 
of eye diseases, systemic risk profiles, healthcare knowledge and access to care23. 
The presence of age-related eye diseases such as cataract, diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) has also been postulated to be associated with increased mortality 
risk15,18,19,22. The severity of DR, for example, may reflect systemic vascular risk24. AMD shares common

risk factors with mortality and cardiovascular diseases (CVD)25–31. Similarly, retinal vein occlusion 
(RVO) has been associated with increased vascular risk and mortality32–34. However, the relationship 
between specific age-related eye diseases with mortality in population-based studies has been mixed. 
While some studies have reported associations between cataract15,18–20,22,35, AMD15 and DR18,19,22 with 
mortality, others have not found independent relationships12,16,18,19,22,36. In addition, only few studies have 
been conducted in Asia20–22 in which AMD and glaucoma, in particular, have different clinical features 
and possibly underlying pathogenic mechanisms37–40. 
Age-related eye diseases and VI is likely to increase substantially in Asia in the next few decades41–43. 
In this study, we describe the relationship of VI and major age-related eye diseases with all-cause and 
CVD mortality events in a population-based cohort of Asian Malay persons. 
Methods 
Study population. The Singapore Malay Eye Study is a population-based, cohort study, in which 
3280 (response rate 78.7%) urban Malay adults aged 40 to 79 years living in Singapore were examined 
between August 2004 and June 2006. Study design and population details have been described else- 
where44. A total of 3273 participants were included in this analysis as visual acuity could not be success- 
fully measured in 7 participants. All study procedures were performed in accordance with the tenets of 
the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 1989. Written informed consent was obtained from the subjects 
and the study was approved by the Singhealth Centralised Institutional Review Board (CIRB approval 
number R1107/9/2014). Participants underwent a standardized interview, systemic and ocular examina- 
tion, and laboratory investigations at baseline. 
Assessment of visual impairment. Presenting visual acuity (PVA) (with participants wearing their 
glasses or contact lenses, if any) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (with subjective refraction 
conducted by certified optometrists) were measured using the logMAR number chart (Lighthouse 
International) at a distance of 4 m. If no numbers were read at 4 m, the participants were moved to 3, 2, 
or 1 m, consecutively. If no numbers were identified, visual acuity was assessed as counting fingers, hand 
motions, light perception, or no light perception. BCVA and PVA were used in our analysis, although 
PVA is likely to be more relevant in the practical setting as this reflects the “true” visual acuity of the 
study population in their daily activities of living. VI was defined as greater than 0.30 logMAR in the 
better-seeing eye (US definition)45. 
Assessment of age-related eye diseases. Complete ophthalmic examinations of the anterior seg- 
ment, fundus, and optic discs were conducted at the slit lamp using standardized protocols. Cataracts 
were assessed from lens photographs using the Wisconsin Cataract Grading System46 and defined as 
nuclear cataract opacity 4 or greater, cortical cataract 25% or greater, posterior subcapsular cataract 5% 
or greater, or previous cataract surgery. Glaucoma was diagnosed and classified using the International 
Society Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology scheme based on gonioscopy, optic disc 
characteristics, and/or visual fields results47. The presence of DR was graded from retinal photographs 
according to a modification of the Airlie House classification system as used in the Early Treatment 
Diabetic Retinopathy Study48. The presence of AMD was graded from retinal photographs according 
to the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System49. Recent central retinal vein occlusion 
(CRVO) was characterized by retinal edema, optic disc hyperemia or edema, scattered superficial and 
deep retinal hemorrhages, and venous dilation. Old CRVO was characterized by occluded and sheathed 
retinal veins, or vascular anastomosis at the optic disc50,51. Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) involved 
a more localized area of the retina in the sector of the obstructed venule and was characterized by scat- 
tered superficial and deep retinal hemorrhages, venous dilation, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities, 
and occluded and sheathed retinal venules50,51. The presence of any retinal vein occlusion (RVO) was 
defined as presence of CRVO or BRVO. 
Assessment of other risk factors. Participants underwent a standardized interview for socioeco- 
nomic measures (eg, income, education, type of housing), lifestyle risk factors (eg. smoking), medication 
use, and self-reported history of systemic diseases. Non-fasting venous blood samples were collected for 
analysis of cholesterol and glucose levels. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm 
Hg or higher, diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, or use of antihypertensive medication. 
Diabetes was defined as a random glucose level of 200 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply 
by 0.0555), use of diabetic medication, or a physician’s diagnosis of diabetes. Body Mass Index (BMI) 
was defined as body mass (kg) divided by the square of the height (m2). History of CVD was ascertained 
through self-reporting (yes or no). 
Assessment of mortality. The unique national registration identity card numbers, together with 
date of birth and gender, of the 3273 members of the original cohort were matched with mortality 
records maintained by the National Registry of Diseases Office of Singapore (NRDO). Vital status as of 
31 December 2012 was determined for all of the participants. Information on the date of death, all-cause 
deaths and CVD deaths for the participants were extracted. The underlying cause of death was reported 
using the International Classification of Diseases 9 codes.

Statistical Analysis. Time-to-event was calculated for each participant from the date of examination 
where visual acuity was measured through December 31, 2012. Cox proportional hazard regression was 
used to investigate the associations of PVA, BCVA, age-related eye diseases and mortality. We constructed 
2 multivariable models: 1) adjusted for age and gender; and 2) adjusted for age, gender, socio-economic 
status, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, BMI and history of CVD. This permits the evaluation of specific 
ocular diseases and VI on survival while controlling for other risk factors. Finally, each specific ocular 
condition was added to the model to determine its independent effect on mortality. Hazard ratios and 
95% confidence intervals (CI) were presented for stratified PVA and BCVA groups. We regard P values of 
< 0.05 from 2-sided tests to indicate statistical significance. We further tested the interaction between DR 
and VI with mortality by including cross-product interaction term as independent variable (i.e. DR*VI) 
in the model. Statistical interactions were deemed significant if the P value for interaction was < 0.1, All 
statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 12.

to be older, have lower socioeconomic status, lower BMI and have a history of CVD, hypertension, dia- 
betes, cataract and late AMD. 
Visual impairment and mortality. By December 31, 2012 (median follow-up 7.24 years), 398 
(12.2%) persons had died in the SiMES cohort. In Cox proportional-hazards models adjusting for age, 
gender, socioeconomic status, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, BMI and history of CVD, participants 
with VI (based on PVA) had a higher all-cause mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR], 1.57; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.25–1.96) and CVD-mortality (HR 1.75; 95% CI, 1.24–2.49) than participants without VI 
(Table 2). Persons with VI in terms of presenting VA (VA > 0.30) had poorer overall survival (Fig. 1) 
and higher CVD-cause mortality, compared with those without (Fig. 2). Similarly, persons with VI in 
terms of BCVA had higher all-cause and CVD-cause mortality. The results were similar when the WHO 
cut-off for visual impairment (VA < 6/18 in better-seeing eye) was used for presenting and best-corrected 
VA (Supplementary Table 2). 
Age-related eye diseases and mortality. 
In terms of specific age-related eye disease (Table 3), DR 
was associated with increased risk of all-cause (HR 1.70; 95% CI, 1.25–2.36) and CVD (HR 1.57; 95% 
CI, 1.05–2.43) mortality. Participants with DR had poorer survival due to all-cause mortality (Fig. 3) 
and CVD-cause mortality (Fig. 4) respectively. In addition, RVO was only associated with increased

risk of CVD mortality (HR 3.14; 95% CI, 1.26–7.73) but not with all-cause mortality (HR 2.02; 95%CI, 
0.91–4.63). None of the other major age-related eye diseases (i.e., cataract, glaucoma and AMD) was 
statistically significantly associated with mortality. In the stratified analysis (Supplementary Table 3), 
we found that the association between DR and all-cause mortality was stronger in subjects with VI 
(p-interaction = 0.035). However, no statistically significant interaction was found with CVD-cause mor- 
tality for DR and VI (p-interaction > 0.1). 
Discussion 
In this prospective population-based study, persons with VI were more likely to die than persons without 
VI, even while controlling for other clinical and socio-economical risk factors for mortality. In particular, 
DR and RVO were associated with increased risk of mortality, particularly CVD mortality. 
Our finding that VI is associated with higher risk of mortality is consistent with that found in sev- 
eral studies in the Western population (Table 4)12,15–19 and three in Asian studies20–22. As the above 
population-based studies span across different ethnicities, it is now highly convincing that VI has a close 
linked relationship with mortality. There are some possible explanations to justify this. First, visual acuity 
is a reflection of functional status and ocular health. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that 
VI leads to functional problems and can contribute to loss of independent mobility2–5, falls8, accidents7 
and psychosocial implications such as depression6. These functional problems in turn may contribute to 
an increased risk of mortality. Second, VI can also be seen as being a marker of aging52 and therefore 
it is not surprising that with aging comes higher incidence of mortality. Having said that, studies have 
not directly proven a causal relationship between VI and mortality, and thus the exact mechanisms for 
higher mortality rates associated with VI remain unclear. Our study adds to knowledge of the impact 
of VI not only on morbidity but also mortality. Reduction of VI such as cataract surgery may also be 
associated with a reduction in risk of mortality. For example, in the BMES, cataract surgery resulting in 
the correction of VI resulted in lower long-term mortality risk (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.41–0.73)53. Further 
studies are essentially needed. 
In our study, we also observed that major age-related retinal vascular conditions such as DR and 
RVO were associated with CVD mortality, even after adjusting for potential confounders. DR was also 
associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality. This positive association of DR with mortality is con- 
sistent with other cohort studies54–56. The ETDRS study also found that poor visual acuity was associated 
with mortality in type 1 diabetics, whereas worsening levels of DR was associated with increasing risk 
of mortality57. This is in line with the hypothesis that microvascular diseases such as retinopathy may 
reflect the macrovascular status in major organs such as the heart and kidney as they may share similar 
underlying pathophysiology58. The presence of DR has also been associated with other risk factors for 
CVD including hypertension and hyperlipidaemia59. When we performed interaction analysis, we found 
that the association between DR and all-cause mortality was stronger in subjects with VI, indicating 
that persons presenting with the coexistence of DR and VI were more likely to have increased risk of 
all-cause mortality. This further highlights the importance of prompt management of DR, which can be 
sight saving as well as life-saving. Vigilant screening for DR, which can be conveniently achieved in a 
non-invasive way by direct visualization of the retinal vessels of the eye, and early diagnosis for RVO 
may therefore play an important role in risk stratification of CVD. In the presence of retinopathy, prompt 
management of the ocular condition as well as optimization of associated vascular risk factors will be 
beneficial in disease control and preserving vision, hence reducing VI, which has also been shown to 
increase risk of mortality as above. We did not find an association between glaucoma, AMD, cataract and 
increased mortality risk, which was similar to the negative findings in many other studies.

The strengths of this study include its large sample size, long follow-up and standardized diagnostic 
protocols for cataract, AMD, DR, RVO and glaucoma. To our knowledge, this is also the first study 
evaluating the association of VI, age-related eye disease and mortality in an Asian Malay population. 
Limitations of our study include the possibility of some of the results being due to chance as there are a 
large number of confounding factors involved and not all may be accounted for. Further studies are also 
needed to investigate if VI has a direct or indirect causal effect on mortality. Longer duration of follow 
up may also be useful in confirming these associations. We also did not have data on the time of onset 
of cataract and time of surgery, which may confound the relationship between the presence of cataract 
and mortality, and whether cataract surgery had an effect on mortality risk.
