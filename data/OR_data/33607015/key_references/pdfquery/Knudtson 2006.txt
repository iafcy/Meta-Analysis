Age-Related Eye Disease, Visual Impairment, 
and Survival 


Objective: To investigate the relationship of age-related 
maculopathy, cataract, glaucoma, visual impairment, and 
diabetic retinopathy to survival during a 14-year period. 
Methods: Persons ranging in age from 43 to 84 years in 
the period from September 15, 1987, to May 4, 1988, par- 
ticipatedinthebaselineexaminationofthepopulation-based 
Beaver Dam Eye Study (n=4926). Standardized protocols, 
including photography, were used to determine the pres- 
ence of ocular disease. Survival was followed using standard- 
ized protocols. 
Results: As of December 31, 2002, 32% of the baseline 
population had died (median follow-up, 13.2 years). Af- 
ter adjusting for age, sex, and systemic and lifestyle fac- 
tors, poorer survival was associated with cortical cataract 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.06-1.37), any cataract (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03-1.32), 
diabetic retinopathy (HR per 1-step increase in 4-level se- 
verity, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.14-1.63), and visual impairment 
(HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.04-1.48) and marginally associated 
with increasing severity of nuclear sclerosis (HR, 1.07; 95% 
CI, 0.99-1.16). Age-related maculopathy and glaucoma 
were not associated with poorer survival. Associations 
tended to be slightly stronger in men than women. 
Conclusions: Cataract, diabetic retinopathy, and visual 
impairment were associated with poorer survival and not 
explained by traditional risk factors for mortality. These 
ocular conditions may serve as markers for mortality in the 
general population. 


vestigated associa- 
tions between ocular 
disorders and sur- 
vival.1-23 In general, 
persons with ocular disorders have been 
shown to have an increased mortality risk 
compared with persons without the dis- 
orders. These associations have been 
shown with cataract,1,2,4,6,9,13-16,18-21 glau- 
coma,7 diabetic retinopathy,8,10,22,23 and vi- 
sual impairment4,9,11,12,17,19 and recently with 
age-related maculopathy (ARM).3,4 In 
many instances, these associations can 
be explained by controlling for systemic 
mortality risk factors because ocular dis- 
orders are associated with these factors. 
However, some studies do not show as- 
sociations with ocular disease and mor- 
tality.2,5,19 Differences in study design, mor- 
tality follow-up, and definitions of these 
ocular conditions may explain some of 
these inconsistencies. In the present study, 
we extend a previous study of mortality 
and eye disease from our group9 in the 
large population-based Beaver Dam Eye 
Study to 14 years of follow-up. 


The Beaver Dam Eye Study population has been 
described in detail elsewhere.24 Briefly, a private 
census of the population of Beaver Dam, Wis, was 
performed from September 15, 1987, to May 4, 
1988. Eligibility requirements for entry into the 
study included living in the city or township of 
Beaver Dam and being 43 to 84 years of age at the 
timeofthecensus.Atotalof5924individualswere 
eligible to participate, of whom 4926 participated 
in the baseline examination between March 1, 
1988, and September 14, 1990. Differences be- 
tweenparticipantsandnonparticipantshavebeen 
presented previously.24 Follow-up examinations 
were conducted at 5 (n=3722) and 10 (n=2962) 
years after the baseline examination. Ninety-nine 
percent of the population was white. All data were 
collectedwithinstitutionalreviewboardapproval 
in conformity with all federal and state laws, and

laration of Helsinki. 

Participants were examined at the study suite at 
a local hospital or nursing home. Height and body 
weight were measured with participants wearing 
light clothing and no shoes. The pulse rate was

measured.Bloodpressurewasmeasuredwitharandom-zerosphyg- 
momanometeraccordingtotheHypertensionDetectionandFollow- 
up Program protocol,25 and the average of the 2 measurements was 
used for analysis. Hypertension status was defined as a mean sys- 
tolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more, mean diastolic blood 
pressure of 90 mm Hg or more, or current use of antihypertensive 
medications.Nonfastingbloodandurinespecimenswerecollected. 
Measurements obtained included levels of serum cholesterol (total 
and high-density lipoprotein), glycosylated hemoglobin, random 
blood glucose, gross proteinuria, hematocrit, serum albumin, and 
serum creatinine and a white blood cell count.26 Diabetes was de- 
fined as a history of diabetes or hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia was 
definedasaglycosylatedhemoglobinlevelofmorethan2SDsabove 
the mean for the appropriate age and sex group or a casual blood 
glucose level of 200 mg/dL or more ((cid:1)1.1 mmol/L).27 
A standardized questionnaire was administered to collect in- 
formation on medical history, current medication use, smoking 
status, alcohol use, and physical activity.26 A history of cardiovas- 
cular disease was defined as a history of angina, myocardial infarc- 
tion, and/or stroke. Smokers were identified by answering yes to 
smoking at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes. Their status was 
furthercategorizedasacurrentsmokeriftheyhadnotstoppedsmok- 
ingatthebaselineexamination.Pack-yearsweredefinedasthenum- 
ber of packs smoked per day multiplied by the number of years 
smoked. Heavy drinkers were identified by answering yes to ever 
having a period in their life when they consumed 4 or more alco- 
holic beverages on a daily basis. Participants were asked if they en- 
gaged in a regular activity long enough to work up a sweat. Per- 
sons who on average engaged in such activities less than 3 times 
a week were considered to have a sedentary lifestyle. 
Refraction and measurement of the visual acuity was per- 
formed using a modification of the Early Treatment Diabetic Reti- 
nopathy Study protocol.28 Visual impairment was defined as a best 
corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or worse in the better eye and 
included eyes that were blind (visual acuity of 20/200 or worse). 
The subjects’ pupils were pharmacologically dilated, except for 
thosepersonswithnarrowanteriorchamberangles.Aslitlampcam- 
era (Topcon SL; Topcon America Corp, Paramus, NJ) was used 
to obtain photographs of the lens of each eye.29 These photographs 
weregradedforthepresenceandseverityofnuclearsclerosis.29Grad- 
ings of severity were assigned on a 5-step scale, and the presence 
of nuclear cataract was defined as level 4 or level 5. Anterior and 
posterior retroillumination photographs of the lens were obtained 
(Neitz CRT; Neitz Instruments Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) and graded 
for the presence and severity of cortical and posterior subcapsu- 
lar cataracts.29 A measuring grid was used to divide the retroillu- 
mination photographs into a central circular area and 8 sectors of 
equal size. Cortical cataract was considered to be present if 5% or 
more of the lens surface was affected. Posterior subcapsular cata- 
ract was considered to be present if 5% or more of the surface area 
of any of the 8 sectors or the central circular area of the grid was 
involved. Any cataract was defined as the presence of nuclear, cor- 
tical, or posterior subcapsular cataract or if the lens had been re- 
moved during cataract surgery. 
Stereoscopic 30° color fundus photographs centered on the 
disc (Diabetic Retinopathy Study standard field 1) and macula 
(Diabetic Retinopathy Study standard field 2) and a nonstereo- 
scopic color fundus photograph temporal to but including the 
fovea of each eye were obtained.28 Additional fundus photographs 
were obtained of any lesions found outside these fields (eg, dia- 
betic retinopathy lesions). 
Grading for ARM was performed in a masked fashion with 
use of the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading Sys- 
tem.30,31 The system assesses the presence and severity of 14 
lesions associated with ARM. More details on these lesions ap- 
pear elsewhere.30,31 Individual lesions (eg, large drusen and reti- 
nal pigment epithelial depigmentation) were each investi- 
gated separately and as a 3-level severity scale of ARM. Persons 
with no or small drusen only and no pigment abnormalities were 
considered to have no ARM. Persons with signs of geographic 
atrophy or exudative macular degeneration (ie, retinal pig- 
ment epithelial detachment, subretinal hemorrhage, fibrous scar, 
or treatment) were considered to have late ARM. All other per- 
sons were considered to have early ARM. 
The procedures to detect and define open-angle glaucoma have 
been described elsewhere.32 Briefly, the presence of at least 2 of the 
3 following criteria in the same eye was necessary for inclusion as 
a definite case of glaucoma: a visual field abnormality consistent 
with the diagnosis of glaucoma; a cup-disc ratio of at least 0.8 or 
asymmetry of at least 0.2 between the eyes; or an intraocular pres- 
sure of 21 mm Hg or greater. A history of using drops or having 
had surgery for glaucoma with or without any of the previous cri- 
teria was defined as a probable glaucoma case. For purposes of this 
analysis, probable and definite cases were combined. 
Diabetic retinopathy was measured on an 18-level scale de- 
fined elsewhere.33 The scale was reduced to a 4-level severity 
scale of no, mild, moderate, and proliferative retinopathy. Analy- 
ses of retinopathy are given only for subjects with diabetes. 
Vital status was monitored by reading the obituaries of local 
newspapers and by making annual telephone contact. Persons not 
known to have died, but whom we could not reach, had their sur- 
vival time entered as their last contact date. When a death was iden- 
tified in the state of Wisconsin, a request was made to the Wis- 
consinDepartmentofHealthandFamilyServices,DivisionofHealth 
Care Financing, Bureau of Health Information, Vital Records Sec- 
tion, for death certificate information about these persons. Names 
of persons known to have died outside of Wisconsin and those 
with whom we lost contact (no contact since December 31, 2002) 
but were not known to be dead were submitted to the National 
Death Index for matching against national death data. We ascer- 
tained mortality after the baseline 1988-1990 examination to De- 
cember 31, 2002. Cause of death was defined as any contribut- 
ing cause listed in the death certificate according to the codes of 
the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD- 
9) for deaths before December 31, 1998, and International Clas- 
sification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) for deaths thereafter. 
Heartdiseasemortalitywasdefinedaccordingtocodes391.0-398.9, 
402.0-402.9, 404.0-404.9, and 410.0-429.9 from ICD-9 and I01.0- 
I09.9, I11.0-I11.9, I13.0-I13.9, and I20.0-I51.9 from ICD-10. Can- 
cermortalitywasdefinedtoincludedeathsaccordingtocodes140.0- 
208.9 from ICD-9 and C00.0-C97.9 from ICD-10. Stroke mortal- 
ity was defined to include deaths according to codes 430.0-438.9 
from ICD-9 and I60.0–I69.9 from ICD-10. 

For the ocular conditions, when 2 eyes were discrepant in the 
presence of a lesion, the grade assigned for the person was that 
of the more severely involved eye. In contrast, we used the better- 
seeing eye to define visual impairment. We used SAS software, 
version 9, for all statistical analyses.34 Simple statistics included 
computation of means, proportions, and (cid:2)2 and unpaired t tests. 
For univariate analyses, estimates of survival were computed with 
the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier. Tests of signifi- 
cance were performed with the log-rank test. Adjustments for 
age, sex, and other risk factors were made using Cox proportional 
hazards models. Including a squared or cubic term for age was 
not significant in the models. Similarly, adjustment for age us- 
ing 4 age groups in 10-year bands was not as strong a predictor 
as using age linearly. Therefore, we determined that using age 
linearly was the most appropriate age adjustment. We tested the 
proportionality assumption by including an interaction between 
survival time and the risk factor of interest.35 
Multivariate adjustment was investigated using several 
methods. First, a propensity score was determined for each 
of the ocular disease risk factors. The rationale and methods

for using a propensity score are described elsewhere.36-38 In 
brief, logistic regression was used to determine which char- 
acteristics were associated with ocular disease without 
regard to mortality. The conditional probability of the ocular 
disease given the observed covariates was output and strati- 
fied into quintiles. Cox proportional hazard models investi- 
gating ocular disease and mortality were then fit adjusting 
for the propensity score. Second, a stepwise procedure was 
used to determine nonocular risk factors for mortality. These 
models were further reduced to prevent overadjustment. For 
example, glycosylated hemoglobin level and diabetes status 
were both significantly associated with mortality. We chose 
to adjust for diabetes status only. However, reduced models 
were very similar to the models adjusting for all variables 
significantly associated with mortality. Some relationships 
were stronger in men than women, so analyses were run 
separately by sex. Additional stratified analyses were run for 
diabetes status and age (using 65 years of age as a cutoff ). 

By December 31, 2002 (median follow-up, 13.2 years), we 
confirmed by death certificate that 32% (n=1576) of the 
baseline cohort had died. Baseline characteristics of the 
population comparing survivors with those who have died 
are shown in Table 1. Those who died were more likely 
to be older; have higher systolic and lower diastolic blood 
pressures, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol lev- 
els, higher glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and a higher 
pulse rate; consume less alcohol; and have smoked more 
pack-years. In addition, those who died were more likely 
to be male; to have diabetes, hypertension, a history of car- 
diovascular disease, cancer, emphysema, gout, arthritis, 
gross proteinuria, a sedentary lifestyle, and less educa- 
tion; and to be currently using diuretics and aspirin. 
Univariate analyses for eye disease and mortality showed 
that persons with cortical cataract, posterior subcapsular 
cataract, cataract surgery, glaucoma, visual impairment, and 
more severe levels of nuclear sclerosis, ARM, and diabetic 
retinopathy had greater mortality than persons without 
(Table 2). After controlling for age and sex, only increas- 
ing severity of nuclear sclerosis, cortical cataract, any cata- 
ract, diabetic retinopathy, and visual impairment were still 
significant (Table 3 and Figure 1). 
To further evaluate the relationships of ocular disease 
with mortality, we developed multivariate models using

2 different methods. First, a propensity score was calcu- 
lated for each risk factor and then controlled for in Cox 
proportional hazards models. Second, a fully adjusted mul- 
tivariate model was developed. A total of 27 characteris- 
tics of various medical and lifestyle characteristics (listed 
in Table 1) were considered, and after an extensive inves- 
tigation it was determined that the nonocular correlates of 
death in the population included age, sex, gross protein- 
uria, history of cancer, body mass index (BMI), BMI2, ra- 
tio of serum levels of total to high-density lipoprotein cho- 
lesterol, smoking, pulse rate, diabetes status, history of 
cardiovascular disease, sedentary lifestyle, education, and 
systolic blood pressure (data not shown). With the excep- 
tion of nuclear sclerosis severity and diabetic retinopathy, 
the results were similar between the propensity and the mul- 
tivariate models (Table 3). Cortical cataract, any cataract, 
and visual impairment were all significantly associated with 
increased mortality after both types of adjustment. Nuclear 
sclerosis severity remained significantly associated with in- 
creased mortality after adjusting for the propensity score 
but was marginally significant in the fully adjusted model. 
Diabetic retinopathy severity was marginally significant in 
association with mortality after adjusting for the propen- 
sity score and was significant in the fully adjusted model. 
To evaluate these relationships further, we stratified 
analyses by sex, age ((cid:3)65 vs (cid:1)65 years), and diabetes 
status. When restricted to men only, the significant rela- 
tionships shown in Table 2 remained significant. When 
restricted to women only, the relationships between cor- 
tical cataract (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.30), any cataract 
(multivariate-adjusted HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.93-1.34), and 
visual impairment (multivariate-adjusted HR, 1.17; 95% 
CI, 0.93-1.46) were attenuated and no longer statistically 
significant. Restricting the cohort to persons younger than 
65 years showed a significant relationship between visual 
impairment and decreased survival (multivariate HR, 2.18; 
95% CI, 1.02-4.67) and a significant relationship of poorer 
survival with increasing severity of nuclear sclerosis (mul- 
tivariate HR per 1-step increase in severity, 1.22; 95% CI, 
1.03-1.43). Cortical cataract was not associated with mor- 
tality in this younger subgroup. Restricting the cohort to 
persons 65 years or older, the cortical cataract relation- 
ship remained; however, the visual impairment relation- 
ship was attenuated after multivariate adjustment (HR, 1.19; 
95% CI, 0.99-1.43). When persons with diabetes were ex- 
cluded, all significant relationships shown in Table 3 re- 
mained significant. Restricting the analysis to persons with 
diabetes (n=446), the only significant relationship was for 
increasing severity of diabetic retinopathy (Table 3). 
Of the 1576 deaths, 56% had a mention of heart disease, 
28% had a mention of cancer, and 13% had a mention of 
stroke on their death certificates. Cause-specific mortality 
was investigated in these 3 groups using the same methods 
described for all-cause mortality. A separate selection pro- 
cedure was used for each cause of death to determine mul- 
tivariate adjustment (results not shown). After multivar- 
iate adjustment, persons with ocular conditions generally 
had an increased specific-cause mortality risk; however, only 
a few relationships were statistically significant (Figure 2). 
Increasing diabetic retinopathy severity was associated with 
anymentionofheartdiseasemortality(multivariate-adjusted 
HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.25-1.88), and increasing nuclear scle- 
rosisseveritywasassociatedwithanymentionofstrokemor- 
tality (multivariate-adjusted HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.61). 
There were no significant associations between ocular con- 
ditions and cancer mortality. 

By using standardized protocols for the examination, pho- 
tography, and grading of ocular disease, the Beaver Dam 
Eye Study offers a unique opportunity to investigate ocu- 
lar disease as a marker for mortality. Although a previous 
report of mortality in this population9 included deaths 
through November 1993 (median follow-up, 4 years), the 
presentanalysisincludedanadditional9to10yearsoffollow- 
up and 1109 additional deaths. We had found that sever- 
ity of nuclear sclerosis and visual impairment were asso- 
ciatedwithpoorersurvival,butthataftercontrollingformul- 
tiple systemic and lifestyle factors, none of the associations 
were statistically significant. When we used the additional 
deaths and follow-up and investigated more detailed mul- 
tivariate adjustments, we found similar associations. These 
relationships remained significant after adjusting for po- 
tential confounders and other risk factors for mortality, al- 
though for some analyses the association for nuclear scle- 
rosis was marginally significant. In addition, the presence 
of cortical cataract and severity of diabetic retinopathy were 
associated with poorer survival in the current analysis. 
Relationships between eye disease and mortality were 
stronger in men in our study. Women live longer and have 
a better chance of development of eye and other age- 
related comorbid conditions, whereas men die earlier in 
life and are more likely to have fewer comorbid condi-

Figure 2. Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) of ocular disease for specific-cause mortality are plotted for any mention of heart 
disease (A), any mention of cancer (B), and any mention of stroke (C). Hazard ratios for heart disease mortality were adjusted by age, sex, body mass index (BMI), 
BMI2, ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, smoking history, pulse, diabetes status, sedentary lifestyle, education, and systolic blood pressure. 
Hazard ratios for cancer mortality were adjusted by age, sex, BMI, BMI2, cholesterol level, smoking history, pulse, and education. Hazard ratios were adjusted for 
stroke mortality by age, sex, BMI, BMI2, proteinuria, systolic blood pressure, and diabetes status. ARM indicates age-related maculopathy. Increasing levels of 
severity of nuclear sclerosis, ARM, and diabetic retinopathy are described in the “Procedures and Definitions” subsection of the “Methods” section and in Table 2. 
survival could be a result of changes in structural proteins 
that are ubiquitous throughout the body. Such changes have 
been hypothesized to result from oxidation,13 the formation 
of disulfide binding,18 or other age-related protein changes39 
that cause diminished function. Reasons for an association 
specifically with stroke death are unclear and may be a re- 
sult of chance because specific-cause mortality may include 
some misclassification. 
We found a significant association between cortical cata- 
ract and increased mortality, independent of other systemic 
risk factors. Only the Blue Mountains Eye Study19 has pre- 
viously reported this finding, but unlike our study, the as- 
sociation was no longer significant after excluding persons 
with diabetes. Among the personal and environmental risk 
factors associated with cortical cataract aside from age, dia- 
betes has been the most consistent factor. Glycosylation of 
lens proteins may in part be responsible.40 A level of gly- 
cemia below the cut point for overt diabetes may be suffi- 
cient to cause glycosylation of lens proteins. The level of 
glycemia in those not diagnosed as having diabetes has been 
shown to be associated with risk of death, usually caused 
by cardiovascular factors.41,42 Also, UV light exposure ap- 
pears to increase risk of cortical cataract.43,44 Exposure to 
UV light can produce oxidative stress in the eye, resulting 
incorticalcataract;similarsensitivitytoothersystemiccauses 
of oxidative stress may be a mechanism for increased sys- 
temic morbidity.45,46 Finally, a genetic component to cor- 
tical cataract exists.47 Genetic factors related to cortical cata- 
ract may also be linked to decreased longevity. 
Other studies have shown an increased risk among per- 
sons who have undergone cataract surgery.1,13,16 We did not 
find this in our study. It could be that persons who have 
had cataract surgery are more health conscious and have a 
healthier lifestyle than those who did not. For example, in 
our study persons who had undergone cataract surgery were 
more likely to be taking vitamin supplements (M.D.K., un- 
published data, May 2005). Also, persons who have un- 
dergone cataract surgery may have better health care and 
may undergo cataract surgery with less severe lens changes 
than persons with poorer access to health care services. 
Age-related maculopathy was not associated with mor- 
tality in the Rotterdam Eye Study2 or the Blue Moun- 
tains Eye Study.19 However, the Age-Related Eye Dis- 
ease Study showed an increased mortality risk in persons 
with advanced-stage macular degeneration.4 In addi- 
tion, a recent study from the Copenhagen Eye Study 
showed an increased mortality risk in women but not men 
with ARM.3 Data from our study suggest that there is no 
relationship between ARM and mortality. The low preva- 
lence of late ARM or differences in cumulated mortality 
rates may explain some differences. We did not expect 
to find an association because data from the Beaver Dam 
Eye Study have shown that ARM is weakly and incon- 
sistently associated with measures of frailty and not as- 
sociated with cardiovascular disease, stroke, and can- 
cer, the main causes of death.48,49 
Diabetic retinopathy was significantly associated with 
mortality. Although our sample size was smaller, these 
results are consistent with those found in the Wiscon- 
sin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy and other 
studies.8,10,22,23 These data are consistent with the specu- 
lation that retinopathy severity may be a marker of simi- 
lar microvascular disease affecting other organ systems 
in persons with diabetes (eg, heart and kidney). 
Frailty has been shown to be a strong predictor of mor- 
tality.50 Recent research has suggested that visual acuity is 
associated with other frailty markers (eg, handgrip strength 
and peak expiratory flow) and in itself may be considered 
another measure of frailty.51 Therefore, it was not surpris- 
ing that visual impairment was associated with poorer sur- 
vival in our study. Decreased visual acuity was associated 
with mortality in other population-based studies such as 
the Blue Mountains Eye Study19 and the Visual Impair- 
ment Project12 and in the case-control arm of the Age- 
Related Eye Disease Study Clinical trial.4 The visual sys- 
tem is part of the central nervous system. Retinal ganglion 
cells decrease in number with increasing age. Therefore, 
it is not surprising that decreased vision, as a reflection of 
biological aging independent of the specific age-related eye 
diseases, is independently associated with mortality.

The Beaver Dam Eye Study has many strengths for in- 
vestigatingrelationshipsbetweenocularconditionsandmor- 
tality, including the population-based design, large sample 
size, long-term follow-up, use of standardized procedures, 
and a moderately high mortality rate of 32%. However, we 
cannot exclude the possibility that some of the associations 
may be false. The conclusions regarding associations or lack 
ofthemmustbedrawnwithcautionforseveralreasons.First, 
uncontrolled confounding is likely to be at least partly the 
explanation for some of the associations. Eye conditions may 
onlybemarkersforunderlyingetiologicfactorscausingdeath. 
Second, some associations may be due to a chance finding, 
given the relatively large numbers of associations examined. 
Third, the relatively low frequency of certain variables such 
as late ARM and outcomes such as stroke mortality limits 
the ability to detect or reject meaningful relationships be- 
cause of low power. Fourth, it is possible that no relation- 
ships were found between some ocular factors and mortal- 
ity because of survival bias because subjects who developed 
ocular factors that also predisposed them to death after the 
baseline examination were not included. Nevertheless, our 
data suggest that age-related cortical cataract, nuclear scle- 
rosis severity, diabetic retinopathy, and visual impairment 
may serve as important markers for mortality in the general 
population.
