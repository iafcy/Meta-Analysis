Design: Retrospective matched cohort study from July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2010. 
Participants: A blind cohort 65 years of age and older from a volunteer blind register and a cohort of age- 

Methods: Person-level linked hospital, emergency department (ED), mental health, and death records for the 
blind and control cohorts were used. Generalized estimating equations assuming a negative binomial distribution 
were used to estimate relative rates of hospital admissions, lengths of stay, and mortality after adjusting for 
sociodemographic variables and comorbidity. Emergency department and mental health service visits also were 
quantiﬁed. 


Results: The blind cohort comprised 1726 individuals alongside 1726 matched controls; 39% were men, and 
the mean age was 83 years. Combined, the cohorts accumulated a total of 34 130 hospital admissions amounting 
to 201 867 bed-days. After adjusting for the principal reason for hospital admission and comorbidity, the blind 
cohort was admitted to the hospital 11% (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 6%e17%) more often than the control 
cohort. The blind cohort also stayed in the hospital longer than the controls, but this effect varied by age. Blind 
participants 65 to 69 years of age spent 88% more days (95% CI, 27%e178%) in the hospital compared with 
age-matched controls, whereas there was no difference in length of stay between the cohorts by 80 years of age 
(rate ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.97e1.25). A larger proportion of the blind cohort visited a hospital ED and accessed 
mental health services compared with the control cohort. 
Conclusions: Health service use is increased for the elderly blind compared with age-matched controls after 
accounting for comorbidity. The elderly blind have more hospital admissions, ED visits, and mental health-related 
visits. The younger elderly blind stay longer in hospital. However, there was no evidence of worse mortality 
outcomes after adjusting for comorbidity. Ophthalmology 2015;122:2344-2350 ª 2015 by the American Academy

Blindness is principally a disease of aging in developed 
countries. In Western Australia (WA), the prevalence of 
blindness in persons 50 years of age and older is estimated at 
0.4%1 and is expected to increase with an aging population. It 
has been well established that visual impairment in the elderly 
is associated with reduced independence, physical mobility, 
social connectivity, and activities of daily living.1,2 An 
increased prevalence of both physical and mental comor- 
bidities, particularly anxiety and depression, also have been 
reported in the elderly with vision loss.3e5 
Despite well-documented data on the incidence, preva- 
lence, and causes of vision loss and blindness1,6,7 and the 
associated comorbidities, little information exists on how 
vision impairment impacts health service use in the elderly 
blind. Several studies have reported poor vision in the elderly 
as a risk factor for single and recurrent falls8 and for hospital 
falls.9,10 Integrated mental health inter- 
admissions for 
ventions in an outpatient setting have shown improvements in 
depressive symptoms.11 However, 
the extent of hospital 
admissions, length of hospital stays, emergency department 
(ED) presentations, mental health outpatient contacts, and 
mortality outcomes in the elderly blind relative to their 
sighted contemporaries has not been quantiﬁed. 
Herein we report the ﬁndings from a retrospective cohort 
study that used linked population-based administrative data 
sets to compare health service use and mortality outcomes in 
individuals who were registered legally blind at 65 years of 
age and older with an age-matched sighted cohort. The 
Western Australia Data Linkage System is a validated pro- 
cess that creates links that allows records from multiple 
health-related data sets to be brought together for all in- 
dividuals living in WA.12 Western Australia is the largest

state of Australia with a population of 2.5 million, with most 
of the population living in the southwest corner that includes 
the only major metropolitan city, Perth. 

Individuals 65 years of age or older at the time they were ﬁrst 
registered as legally blind were identiﬁed from the voluntary reg- 
ister of the Association for the Blind of Western Australia from 
January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2009, and formed the blind 
cohort. The terms blind and blindness used throughout refer to 
legal blindness in Australia which is deﬁned as having a best- 
corrected visual acuity of more than 1 logarithm of the minimum 
angle of resolution or a visual ﬁeld of less than 10(cid:1) in diameter, or 
a combination of both reduced visual acuity and ﬁeld restriction, 
resulting in an equivalent level of vision loss in the better eye. We 
previously validated the accuracy of the clinical ophthalmic in- 
formation on the register and established that approximately 50% 
of the eligible blind in WA were registered.1,13 
A 1:1 age-matched ((cid:3)2 years) and gender-matched control 
cohort was selected randomly from the state electoral roll. Because 
voting is compulsory in Australia, the electoral roll is considered 
representative of the adult population. The control selection and de- 
identiﬁed extraction of all hospital morbidity, ED, mental health 
outpatient, and death registration records for both cohorts from July 
1, 1999, through June 30, 2010, were performed by the Data 
Linkage Branch, Department of Health of Western Australia.14 
Each blind participant was assigned an index date that corre- 
sponded to the date of conﬁrmed blindness from the blind registry. 
The corresponding age- and gender-matched control was assigned 
the same index date after conﬁrming they were still alive at the 
index date. The hospital morbidity data were manipulated so that 
multiple episodes of care within the same hospital admission were 
combined into a single hospital stay record. Episodes of care fol- 
lowed by a transfer to another hospital also were combined into a 
single admission record. The length of stay for each admission was 
deﬁned as the latest discharge date minus the earliest date of 
admission plus 1. The exposure time that an individual was at risk 
of a hospital stay was deﬁned as time from July 1, 1999, through 
June 30, 2010, or until date of death if earlier. 
The principal reasons for each hospital admission were cate- 
gorized into 218 Clinical Classiﬁcation Systems groups using 
published International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th Edition, 
Clinical Classiﬁcation Systems translation codes.15 Comorbidity 
associated with each hospital admission was identiﬁed from up 
to 21 codiagnosis ﬁelds in the hospital record and was classiﬁed 
the 30 different Elixhauser 
as the presence or absence of 
comorbidity conditions associated with increased risk of 
in- 
hospital death.16 The proportion of participants with hospital 
admissions via the ED, any record of spending time in an 
inpatient psychiatric unit, and death during the study period also 
were determined. 
The Accessibility and Remoteness Index of Australia was used 
to describe geographical accessibility to health services.17 This 
index uses information about populations based on their access, 
by road, to service centers (towns) of various sizes, and ranges 
from major cities to the very remote. The Index of Relative 
Socio-economic Disadvantage was based on the most recent resi- 
dential postcode.18 This index combines census collected data on 
income, education, and unemployment of people and families, as 
well as dwellings within an area, and ranks these areas on a 
scale of relative disadvantage. 
Age was classiﬁed into 10-year age groups to demonstrate 
overall trends. Being recorded as married or in a de facto relationship 
at the time of the 3 most recent hospital admissions was classiﬁed 
as partnered. Identiﬁcation with being aboriginal or of Torres Strait 
Islander ethnicity on any hospital record was classiﬁed as being 
indigenous. Limited demographic information was available for 
participants who were not admitted to a hospital at all during the 
follow-up period and were classiﬁed as unknown where necessary. 

Bivariate associations of the various demographic factors and blind 
status were tested using Pearson’s chi-square test for proportions, 
t tests for normally distributed continuous variables, and the Wil- 
coxon rank-sum test for medians. Because of multiple testing (218 
identiﬁed diagnostic groups, 30 comorbidity groups), Bonferroni- 
adjusted critical P values were used when appropriate. Bivariate 
tests of associations with count variables were performed using 
negative binomial regression models with a single independent 
variable. All hospital admissions (including renal dialysis) were 
included in all regression analyses. 
The association of being blind with hospital use was investi- 
gated using regression modeling adjusted for potential con- 
founders, 
the known 
in particular comorbidity, because of 
association of blindness with increased morbidity. There were 
several steps involved in the modelling process. First, the records 
of each participant were collapsed such that the total number of 
hospital admissions, combined total length of stay (number of bed- 
days), and the presence or absence of all principal diagnostic and 
comorbidity groups at any time during follow-up were summarized 
onto a single record per participant. The length of follow-up 
(exposure time) for each participant also was recorded. Second, 
each of the large number of possible principal diagnostic and co- 
morbidity combinations were reduced further into 2 empirically 
derived variables for each of the 2 main outcome measures: total 
number of admissions and the total number of bed-days. To create 
these empirically derived variables, each outcome was modeled 
using negative binomial regression models that included either all 
218 identiﬁed principal diagnostic groups or all 30 comorbidity 
groups and accounted for exposure time. Based on these 4 models, 
the predicted total number of admissions and predicted total length 
of stay per person were estimated for each covariate pattern rep- 
resented by the different possible combinations of either the prin- 
cipal diagnoses or comorbidity variables. 
Finally, the effect of blindness on the 2 main outcome measures 
was estimated in 2 further models that included the newly created 
empirically derived variables containing the predicted outcome 
based on principal diagnosis and comorbidity. Other variables 
included in the ﬁnal modeling process were age, gender, marital 
status, accessibility to services, and whether the participant un- 
derwent renal dialysis or chemotherapy or died during the follow- 
up period. To account for any similarity (lack of independence) 
between blind participants and their matched control, generalized 
estimating equations assuming a negative binomial distribution 
were used to estimate rate ratios after accounting for exposure time. 
Mortality rates were age standardized using the 2009 WA 
population. Poisson regression was used to model mortality rates. 
Analysis was carried out using IBM PASW software version 18 
(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and Stata software version 13 
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). This study was approved by 
the Human Research Ethics Committees of Curtin University and 
the Western Australia Department of Health. 

The blind cohort consisted of 1726 people conﬁrmed as being 
legally blind and older 
than 65 years with 1726 age- and 
gender-matched persons in the control cohort. The mean age was 


83 years (standard deviation, (cid:3)7 years) and 39% were male. 
Demographic characteristics of the cohorts are summarized in 
Table 1. More of the blind cohort lived in major urban areas 
compared with the control cohort, but there were no differences 
in socioeconomic status, marital status, or aboriginal ethnicity 
observed between the cohorts. 

The most frequent single causes of blindness in the blind cohort 
were age-related macular degeneration (n ¼ 1096; 63.5%) followed 
by glaucoma (n ¼ 98; 5.7%) and diabetic retinopathy (n ¼ 47; 
2.7%). Other less frequent single causes of blindness were optic 
neuropathy (n ¼ 33), retinal dystrophies (n ¼ 24), corneal condi- 
tions (n ¼ 14), lens conditions (n ¼ 15), and occlusions (n ¼ 14). 
Multiple causes of blindness were observed in 246 people (14.3%), 
with almost half being the result of macular degeneration and 
glaucoma with or without cataract (n ¼ 118; 48.0%). There were 77 
people (4.5%) for whom a deﬁnitive cause of blindness could not 
be determined because of lack of information on the blind register. 

The average number of hospital admissions per person did not vary 
signiﬁcantly between the blind and control cohorts after taking

(Table 2). However, after 
length of 
excluding admissions 
the blind cohort 
experienced more nonrenal hospital admissions than the control 
cohort. On average, each person in the blind cohort stayed in the 
hospital longer than persons in the control cohort regardless of 
whether days of 
renal dialysis were excluded. A higher 
proportion of persons in the blind cohort attended a hospital ED 
and received public mental health outpatient care over the study 
period compared with the control cohort. Overall, there were 208 
individuals who did not attend the hospital during the study 
period, but this did not vary between the cohorts. There was no 
difference in the number of patients in each cohort who had day 
admissions for routine renal dialysis or chemotherapy or who 
spent time in a hospital psychiatric unit. 

Combined, there were 34 309 hospital admissions during the follow- 
up period with just over half (53%) attributed to the blind cohort 
(Table 3). The distribution of total admissions per person was highly 
skewed because 19 patients had a combined total of 7450 
admissions for renal dialysis. Just 3% (n ¼ 483) of hospital 
admission records 
included blindness 
(International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Tenth Edition, code, 
H54.0) as a diagnosis or codiagnosis. A higher proportion of 
admissions by persons in the blind cohort were via the ED 
compared with the control cohort. 


There were 14 principal diagnostic groups that accounted for 
more than half (51%) of all hospital admissions for both cohorts 
combined (Table 3). Admissions for chronic renal failure were the 
most numerous, although the relative proportions did not vary 
between the blind and control cohorts. Of the most frequent 
diagnostic groups, there were more admissions for diabetes with 
complications, pulmonary disease, and anemia in the blind cohort 
compared with controls. In contrast, there were more admissions 
related to cataracts and cancer treatments in the control cohort. Of 
the less frequently observed diagnostic groups, persons in the blind 
cohort also were more likely to be admitted with immunity 
disorders, disorders of the jaw and teeth, schizophrenia and related 
disorders, glaucoma, 
retinal detachments, eye infections, and 
peripheral and visceral atherosclerosis (all P < 0.00023, data not 
shown). 
Comorbid conditions recorded at the time of admission were 
classiﬁed into 30 Elixhauser comorbid conditions (Table 4, 
available at www.aaojournal.org). Persons in the blind cohort 
were signiﬁcantly more likely to have had hypertension, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, or diabetes with complications 
recorded as comorbidity compared with the control cohort. 
The mean number of admissions that excluded renal dialysis 
were signiﬁcantly higher in the blind cohort compared with the 
control cohort, but there was no difference between the cohorts for 
number of admissions that included renal dialysis (Table 2). To 
determine if these differences remained after adjusting for the 
social, demographic, and clinical variation between the cohorts, a 
multivariate regression model was constructed (Table 5). The 
blind cohort had 11% (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 6%e17%) 
more hospital admissions than the control cohort after accounting 
for 
the number of admissions predicted by the principal 
diagnosis along with comorbidity, renal dialysis, chemotherapy, 
and whether participants died during the follow-up period (hospi- 
tal admission rates are known to increase in last year of life). 
Women had 9% fewer admissions than men, and those living in 
outer regional areas tended toward more hospital admissions. So- 
cioeconomic status and marital status were not associated with the 
number of hospital admissions.

The combined blind and control cohorts spent a total of 201 867 
bed-days in hospital over the 11-year study period. Renal dialysis 
accounted for 7476 (3.7%) of total bed-days. The unadjusted mean 
number of days spent in the hospital by each person over the 
11-year period on average was greater 
the blind cohort 
compared with controls regardless of whether renal dialysis was 
excluded (Table 2). 

The number of days spent in the hospital for different medical 
conditions varied between the cohorts (Table 3). Almost 5% of 
bed-days in the hospital for the blind cohort was for complica- 
tions of diabetes compared with only 2% of the control cohort 
bed-days. The blind cohort also had an increased proportion of 
bed-days in hospitals for acute cerebrovascular disease, lower 
limb fractures, chronic lung disease, heart conditions, and mood 
disorders compared with the control cohort. Interestingly, 
the 
control cohort had a higher proportion of bed-days for hip and 
other fractures compared with the blind cohort. There was no 
difference between the cohorts in the proportion of bed-days for 
chronic renal failure, back problems, or dementia and related 
conditions. 
Regression models showed that blindness developing after 65 
years of age was associated with an average 10% increase in the 
average number of days in the hospital over the study period 
compared with the control cohort after accounting for clinical 
features (Table 5). There was evidence that this increase in the blind 
cohort varied by age (interaction term P ¼ 0.004). Blind persons 65 
to 69 years of age spent 88% (95% CI, 27%e178%) more days in 
the hospital compared with controls of the same age, and blind 
persons 70 to 79 years of age spent 23% (95% CI, 3%e48%) 
more days in the hospital, whereas by 80 to 89 years of age, 
there were no signiﬁcant differences in the mean number of bed- 
days between the blind and control cohorts (rate ratio, 1.10; 95% 
CI, 0.97e1.25). The number of days in the hospital also was 
increased for those without a partner at last admission, older per- 
sons, and those living in outer regional and remote areas. 
Of the study population, 31% (1068) died between the index date 
and the study end date, with more deaths in the blind cohort 
(n ¼ 577) than the control cohort (n ¼ 491; Table 2). The mortality 
rate for those older than 65 years was 79 per 1000 person-years for 
the blind cohort (95% CI, 69e89) and 58 per 1000 person-years for 
the control cohort (95% CI, 51e66) when age was standardized 
to the WA population, a 20% increased death rate (95% CI, 
7e135) for aged blind persons. However, the observed difference 
in mortality rates between the blind and control cohorts dis- 
appeared after adjusting for comorbid conditions in a Poisson 
regression model that also included age and gender (rate, 1.08; 
95% CI, 0.95e1.21). 

This study is unique in that it used linked health data sets to 
evaluate the use of health care services by a large cohort of 
blind elderly persons. Overall, the blind elderly went to the 
hospital more frequently, more often as an emergency, and 
stayed longer, particularly for those younger than 80 years, 
and were more likely to attend an ED and access mental 
health outpatient services. 
It is well established that blindness is associated with 
increased comorbidity, with the vision loss itself often a 
consequence of underlying chronic disease.4,19 Therefore, it 
is not unexpected that the elderly blind would have increased 
health service use. However, our observed differences 
remained after taking comorbidity and the principal reason 
for hospitalization into account. This suggests that blindness- 
related factors such as loss of functional ability to carry out 
activities of daily living and increased requirement for social 
and community support could result in a lower threshold for

hospital admissions and subsequent longer stays independent 
of comorbidity. It is also likely that ﬁndings are subject to 
some residual confounding from unmeasured aspects of co- 
morbidity, such as severity, a limitation that can be overcome 
with a prospective randomized study. 
The blind cohort spent more days in the hospital with mood 
disorders and had more contact with public mental health 
outpatient services compared with the control cohort. These 
data support previous reports of signiﬁcant levels of mental 
illness and depression, estimated to affect up to one-third of 
severely visually impaired and blind people.20 Generally, only 
severe affective disorder is treated in an acute care hospital 
setting, so the extent of depression in either the blind or 
control cohort is likely an underestimate. Rather, the present 
data represent the severe end of psychiatric conditions. 
Our ﬁndings that the blind cohort spent more days in the 
hospital for lower limb fractures (excluding neck of femur), 
but proportionally fewer days in the hospital for neck of femur 

and other fractures, compared with controls is surprising. It is 
well known that vision impairment is a risk factor for falls and 
injuries,21,22 but our ﬁndings seem to suggest that the blind 
elderly cohort experienced a different type of fracture proﬁle 
than the controls. This ﬁnding remains to be veriﬁed in a more 
detailed study, but if it was this case, it could assist with 
design of rehabilitation programs targeting the blind. 
We previously reported higher mortality rates in working- 
age blind people (age range, 18e65 years) when compared 
with normally sighted and age-matched controls.23 Here, the 
increased crude mortality in elderly blind was explained 
entirely by the increased comorbidity. This suggests that 
blindness per se did not increase the death rate in the elderly 
blind, 
associated 
rather 
to other observational 
comorbidity. This is in contrast 
studies that report greater excess mortality in the elderly 
with vision loss.24,25 These studies were able to adjust for 
functional ability, which we could not, a limitation of our

study. However, these previous studies were restricted to self- 
reporting of a limited set of comorbid conditions, whereas we 
were able to account for a large range of comorbidity. 
The strength of the present study was the ability to combine 
large health-related data sets at the individual person level 
across the entire state population, avoiding bias limitations 
associated with single-center studies. To the best of our 
knowledge, no other data are available on the health service use 
of such a large cohort of elderly legally blind persons. We 
previously validated the clinical information in the register of 
the Western Australia Association for the Blind and found it 
accurately recorded the level of vision loss.13 However, only 
50% of those eligible were actually registered with the 
Western Australia Association for the Blind,1 and thus

the blind elderly cohort was 
Although we believe that 

broadly representative, those registered as blind were more 
likely to have accessed a range of rehabilitation services 
compared with those not registered, and the impact of this on 
health service use currently is unknown. It is particularly 
difﬁcult to assess because of the poor coding of blindness as 
a comorbid condition. Only 3% of hospital admission 
records for the blind cohort listed blindness as a comorbidity. 
These data suggest that blindness is not only a signiﬁcant 
burden for the individual, but also the health care system, from 
being prone to more comorbidity and potentially the condition 
of blindness itself. Programs improving self-esteem that enable 
and encourage social connectivity may reduce depression and 
related mental health problems. Further research is required to 
provide insight into whether encouraging and directing the 
blind elderly toward existing, community-based rehabilitation 
programs reduces the frequency of emergency presentations 
and length of time spent in hospitals.
