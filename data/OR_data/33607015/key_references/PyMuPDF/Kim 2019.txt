Abstract:
The association between visual impairment and higher mortality remains unclear.
In addition, evidence is lacking on the interaction between visual function and physical activity on
mortality. We used data of individuals with no disability or with visual impairment among those who
participated in the National Health Screening Program in Korea in 2009 or 2010. We constructed Cox
proportional hazard models adjusted for potential confounders to evaluate the independent association
between visual impairment and mortality. More severe visual impairment was associated with higher
all-cause mortality (p-value for trend = 0.03) and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (p-value for
trend = 0.02) and that due to other diseases (p-value for trend = 0.01). We found an interaction on an
additive scale between visual impairment and no physical activity on all-cause mortality (relative
excess risk due to interaction = 1.34, 95% conﬁdence interval: 0.37, 2.30, p-value = 0.01). When we
stratiﬁed the study population by physical activity, the association between visual impairment and
mortality was only found among individuals who did not engage in regular physical activity (p-value
for trend = 0.01). We found an independent association between visual impairment and mortality
and modiﬁcation of this association by physical activity.

1. Introduction
Visual impairment lowers the health-related quality of life and independence in activities of daily
living [1,2] and leads to adverse health outcomes such as depression and fractures, resulting in a
considerable socioeconomic burden [3]. Globally, in 2015, 441.1 million people were estimated to have
visual impairment. Due to worldwide population aging, the number of people with visual impairment

has been sharply increasing (35.5% increase for moderate or severe visual impairment from 1990 to
2015) [4]. Visual impairment has emerged as a public health concern during the last decades.
Therefore, the eﬀects of visual impairment on health, physical activity, chronic diseases, and
mortality should be elucidated to mitigate its burden on individuals, communities, and the healthcare
system. However, unlike others, the eﬀect of visual impairment on mortality has puzzled researchers;
some studies have reported an increased mortality in individuals with visual impairment [5–11], while
others have not [12–16]. In addition, as visual impairment exacerbates the impact of chronic conditions
on health-related quality of life [1], the association between visual impairment and mortality should be
investigated considering the possible interaction between health-related conditions including physical
activity, which is one of the modiﬁable factors aﬀecting mortality in individuals with deteriorated
vision. Physical activity has been shown to lower mortality in various populations, and, therefore,
the association between visual function and mortality may diﬀer by physical activity status. However,
evidence is lacking on the interaction between visual function and physical activity with regard to
mortality [5].
Therefore, in the present study, we hypothesized that visual impairment would be independently
associated with increased mortality and that physical activity would modify the association between
visual function and mortality. We evaluated these hypotheses using a cohort of the Korean national
health examinees.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Participants
We used data from the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort
(NHIS-HEALS) of the Republic of Korea, which has been constructed by the NHIS to enhance public
research. The study protocol and detailed information of the NHIS-HEALS has been published
elsewhere [17]. In brief, a random sample of the participants in the National Health Screening
Program, which is free and invites all residents aged ≥40 years in the Republic of Korea at least every
2 years, constitutes this cohort (n = 514,866). Information on sociodemographic factors, lifestyle, past
medical history, physical examinations, clinical laboratory test results, and mortality are included in
the NHIS-HEALS.
In the present study, we used data of 362,285 individuals who participated in the National Health
Screening Program in 2009 or 2010 because the health screening program was reorganized in 2009
and the number of survey items increased from 33 to 47 in that year. We further excluded individuals
with physical (n = 687), auditory (n = 463), language (n = 209), intellectual (n = 117), and mental
(n = 93) disabilities, brain lesions (n = 328), and other types of disability (including developmental,
kidney, heart, and liver disabilities) (n = 404), leading to a ﬁnal sample size of 359,984 individuals.
We used information on disabilities from the National Handicapped Registry, which was provided to
researchers by the NHIS-HEALS. The ﬁnal study population comprised 359,523 individuals with no
disabilities and 461 with visual impairment.
The Ethics Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital reviewed and approved the
protocol of this study (E-1804-045-936). We conducted the present study using de-identiﬁed data
(NHIS-HEALS) released to researchers for the purpose of public research.
2.2. Visual Impairment
In the Republic of Korea, individuals diagnosed with visual impairment by a medical doctor are
registered in the National Handicapped Registry to receive disability beneﬁts. Visual impairment is
assessed by the diagnosing physicians on six grades according to severity [18]. Although individuals
with visual impairment were assessed as 6 grades (grade 1 to grade 6) in the National Handicapped
Registry, the NHIS-HEALS provides information on the grade of visual impairment only as “severe”
(grade 1 or 2) and “mild” (grades 3–6) due to conﬁdentiality issue. Because individuals who have a

best-corrected visual acuity of ≤0.02 (20/1000) in the better-seeing eye are classiﬁed as grade 1 and those
with best-corrected visual acuity of 0.02–0.04 (20/1000–20/500) in the better-seeing eye as grade 2, severe
visual impairment was deﬁned as best-corrected visual acuity ≤0.02 (20/1000) in the better-seeing eye
in the present study. Meanwhile, mild visual impairment was deﬁned as a best-corrected visual acuity
of 0.06–0.2 (6/100–20/100) in the better-seeing eye, ≤0.02 (20/1000) in the worse-seeing eye, or any visual
ﬁeld defects (grades 3–6) in the present study.
We coded a variable for visual impairment as 0 (no visual impairment, reference), 1 (mild
visual impairment), and 2 (severe visual impairment) and used it in further analyses as an
independent variable.
2.3. Physical Activity
Information on physical activity is obtained in the NHIS-HEALS using a self-reported questionnaire
inquiring on the frequency of leisure-time exercise ≥20 min, which causes rapid breathing (e.g., running,
aerobics, fast cycling, or mountain climbing), corresponding to vigorous-intensity physical activity.
We categorized the frequency of physical activity (day/week) as none (0 day/week), 1 or 2 days/week,
3 or 4 days/week, or ≥5 days/week and used the categorized frequency of physical activity in
further analyses.
2.4. All-Cause and Cause-Speciﬁc Mortality
We obtained information on dates and causes of death occurring between 1 January 2010 and
31 December 2013. Statistics Korea provided the information on mortality, and the NHIS merged
this information with the other data using personal identiﬁcation numbers. We categorized cause of
death as death caused by cardiovascular disease (deﬁned as International Classiﬁcation of Disease,
10th Revision [ICD-10] codes I20–I25, I50, and I60–I70), cancer (C00–C97), and other causes, according
to a previous study [6].
2.5. Assumed Causal Pathway and Adjusted Covariates
We assumed a causal pathway for the association between visual impairment and mortality
as depicted in Figure 1, based on previous studies [5–9,12–14,19–22], to assess the independent
association by identifying potential confounders and mediators. In brief, we selected older age,
systematic diseases and conditions (body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, serum levels of fasting glucose, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
aminotransferase, and gamma glutamyltransferase, and history of stroke, heart disease, hypertension,
type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and other diseases including cancer), income, residing area, and
lifestyle factors (smoking status and alcohol consumption) as potential confounders, which could
aﬀect both visual function and mortality and possibly bias the results. After identifying the potential
confounders, we adjusted them in further analyses. We did not adjust for physical activity in the main
models because physical activity may mediate the association between visual function and mortality
partially (Figure 1) [5,19,21] and the association between visual impairment and mortality could be
underestimated when adjusting for physical activity. Detailed information on selected covariates is
presented in the Supplementary Material.

2.6. Statistical Analysis
After visually checking that survival curves did not cross by visual function (no visual impairment,
mild visual impairment, and severe visual impairment) using the Kaplan–Meier curves (Supplemental
Material Figure S1), we constructed Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for potential confounders
to evaluate the association between visual impairment and all-cause mortality. We also constructed
cause-speciﬁc proportional hazard models adjusted for the same covariates to assess the associations
between visual impairment and cause-speciﬁc mortality (mortality due to cardiovascular disease,
cancer, or other diseases). We estimated p-values for trend by treating the variable for visual impairment
as a continuous variable, not as an ordinal one. We also conducted the same analyses further adjusted
for physical activity (none, 1–2, 3–4, or ≥5 times/week).
We then conducted stratiﬁed analysis using the same Cox models by the household income levels
(0–3 deciles as lower income level, 4–7 as middle income level, and 8–10 as higher income level),
sex, and body mass index (≥23 kg/m2 and <23 kg/m2) to identify vulnerable groups for decreased
visual function.
We investigated whether physical activity would modify the association between visual
impairment and mortality. It has been argued that interaction on an additive scale, rather than
that on a multiplicative scale, is more suitable for evaluating biological interactions [23]. Therefore,
we estimated a measure for additive interaction (i.e., relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI)).
If the risk of certain outcome for exposure X1 is A and the risk of outcome for exposure X2 is B, then
the RERI is greater than zero in case the risk of outcome noted as C is greater than A + B when
simultaneously exposed to X1 and X2 (RERI = C −(A + B)).
To conduct this analysis, we re-categorized physical activity as no or yes (≥once/week) and
assigned yes (≥once/week) as a reference because it has been reported that preventive factors (e.g.,
physical activity) should be recoded as risk factors to adequately estimate measures for additive
interaction [24]. We also re-categorized visual impairment as no or yes (collapsed the categories for
severe and mild visual impairment) and estimated the RERI between visual impairment (no or yes)
and physical activity (no or yes) using logistic regression models adjusted for the same covariates.
We assessed the null hypothesis that RERI = 0 using the Z-test and estimated the conﬁdence interval
(CI) and p-value [24]. Because a RERI score >0 denotes greater risk than the sum of each main eﬀect in
the case when exposures occur simultaneously, in the present study, a RERI score >0 can be interpreted

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 4386

as higher mortality due to interaction compared to the additive eﬀects of both visual impairment and
no physical activity. We assessed the association between visual impairment and mortality in each
stratum stratiﬁed by physical activity (none and ≥once/week).
In sensitivity analyses, we performed analyses after excluding individuals diagnosed with
vision-threatening conditions such as detachment of retinal pigment epithelium (H33.0, H33.1, H33.2,
H33.3, H33.4, and H33.5), central retinal artery occlusion (H34.1), degeneration of the macula and
posterior pole (H35.3), optic neuropathy (H46), visual disturbances (H53.0, H53.2, H53.2, H53.3, H53.4,
H53.5, H53.6, H53.8, and H53.9), and visual impairment (H54.0, H54.1, H54.2, H54.3, H54.4, H54.6,
and H54.9) between 2002 and 2010 (n = 25,782) among those classiﬁed in the no visual impairment
group. Finally, we conducted analyses further including individuals with physical, auditory, language,
intellectual, and mental disabilities, brain lesions, and other types of disability classiﬁed in the no
visual impairment group.
We performed the analyses using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and R
version 3.5.2 (The Comprehensive R Archive Network, Vienna, Austria; http://cran.r-project.org).
3. Results
We analyzed the data of 359,523 individuals with no visual impairment, 328 with mild visual
impairment, and 133 with severe visual impairment in the present study. Compared with individuals
with no visual impairment, those with visual impairment were more likely to be older (71.5 years vs.
59.0 years), not exercise regularly (78.4% vs. 59.3%), and have history of stroke (6.5% vs. 1.8%), heart
disease (8.4% vs. 4.7%), hypertension (51.3% vs. 36.5%), and type 2 diabetes (21.2% vs. 12.1%) (Table 1).

a p-values were estimated by Chi-square test for categorical variables and ANOVA test for continuous variables.
Because only 461 individuals with visual impairment were included compared with 359,523 with
no visual impairment, we controlled for extensive aforementioned covariates in further analyses, to
increase the comparability between individuals with no visual impairment and those with visual
impairment. After adjusting for potential confounders, more severe visual impairment was associated
with higher all-cause mortality (p-value for trend = 0.03) and mortality due to cardiovascular (p-value
for trend = 0.02) and due to other diseases (p-value for trend = 0.01). Severe visual impairment was
associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.08, 3.35) and mortality due to
cardiovascular disease (HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.23) compared with no visual impairment (Table 2).
When we conducted analyses further adjusted for physical activity, there were no marked changes in
the results (Table 2).

We conducted stratiﬁed analyses by household income levels, sex, and body mass index to identify
vulnerable populations for visual impairment. When we stratiﬁed the analyses by household income
level, more severe visual impairment was associated with higher all-cause mortality among those
with lower income levels (p-value for trend = 0.01) but not among those with middle (p-value for
trend = 0.79) or higher income levels (p-value for trend = 0.21). We found the association between
severe visual impairment and all-cause mortality among those with lower income levels (HR = 3.63,
95% CI: 1.36, 9.73) but not with those with middle (HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 0.63, 4.48) or higher income

12.46) but not among men with lower income levels (HR = 2.52, 95% CI: 0.35, 18.05). In addition,
the association between severe visual impairment and all-cause mortality was also found among
individuals with lower income levels and a body mass index ≥23 kg/m2 (HR = 4.64, 95% CI: 1.15, 18.74)
but not among those with lower income levels and a body mass index <23 kg/m2 (HR = 3.18, 95%
CI: 0.79, 12.87) (Figure 2). The conﬁdence intervals were wider in these analyses, because we further
stratiﬁed the lower income group by sex or body mass index and, therefore, the sample size in each
stratum was smaller.
We found an interaction on an additive scale between visual impairment and no physical activity
on all-cause mortality (RERI = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.37, 2.30, p-value = 0.01). When we stratiﬁed the study
population by physical activity, an association between visual impairment and mortality was found
among individuals who did not engage in regular physical activity (p-value for trend = 0.01), but not
among those who engaged in regular physical activity (p-value for trend = 0.41) (Table 3).

When we excluded individuals diagnosed with possibly vision-threatening conditions among those
classiﬁed in the no visual impairment group, the results were robust (Supplementary Material Table S1).
The results were also robust in the analyses including individuals with physical, auditory, language,
intellectual, and mental disabilities, brain lesions, and other types of disability (Supplementary Material
Table S2).
4. Discussion
We found an independent association between visual impairment and mortality after adjusting
for potential confounders, which was stronger among individuals with lower income levels. However,
when we stratiﬁed the study population by physical activity, the association between visual impairment
and mortality was not found among individuals who engaged in regular physical activity.
Previous studies have produced inconsistent results regarding the association between visual
impairment and mortality, with some studies reporting the association [5–11], while other studies
reporting no association [12–16]. This inconsistency may be due to diﬀerences in various factors,
such as the sociodemographic features of the study population, the assessment method of visual
function and mortality, study design, sample size, and follow-up period. Because various factors could
confound or mediate the association (Figure 1), inadequate selection of covariates and speciﬁcation of
analytical models may also contribute to the inconsistency (e.g., adjustment of mediating factors, such
as depressive symptoms and falls) [5–16]. In the present study, we performed analyses adjusted for
potential confounders (older age, systemic diseases and conditions, and other potential confounders)
and not mediators based on carefully assumed pathways (association mediated by increased accidents

and falls [25], psychological change, such as depression [26], functional independence [27], and
decreased physical activity [28]) (Figure 1). Therefore, the present study provides additional evidence
for the independent association between visual impairment and mortality. However, although these
pathways can be aﬀected by social support and resource availability, and therefore, income levels,
to our knowledge, no studies have reported a stronger association of visual impairment and mortality
in lower income levels. Further studies are warranted to conﬁrm the results of the present study.
Although physical activity has been associated with overall health, well-being, and decreased
mortality [29,30] and reportedly individuals with visual impairment and blindness have lower physical
activity levels [19,31,32], to our knowledge, only one study investigated the interaction between visual
impairment and physical activity on mortality [5]. In that study, conducted with a prospective cohort
in Norway, the mortality risk for both visual impairment and no physical activity was much higher
than the sum of the mortality risk for only visual impairment and the mortality risk for only no
physical activity. This departure from additivity was most substantial among those aged <60 years [5].
In addition, few studies have evaluated the association between physical activity and decreased
mortality among individuals with visual impairment [28,33]. The results of the present study are
consistent with the results of these previous studies [5,28,33]. These results highlight the importance of
physical activity as a matter of concern when designing public health interventions for the visually
impaired, such as developing appropriate physical activity programs and providing regular physical
activity sessions through public health centers.
There are several limitations in the present study. First, although the overall prevalence of visual
impairment was assessed to be 4.3% in the Republic of Korea [34], only a small proportion of individuals
with visual impairment were included in the present study (359,523 with no visual impairment vs.
461 with visual impairment). However, we considered extensive factors including sociodemographic
features, lifestyle, past medical history, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory test results of both
participants with and those without visual impairment and controlled for the possible confounding
eﬀects of these factors in assessing the association between visual impairment and mortality. Second,
instead of evaluating visual function directly during the survey, we used the information from
the National Handicapped Registry [18] to identify individuals with visual impairment, leading to
misclassiﬁcation bias. Because diagnosis by a medical doctor and assessment of disability are needed
to register in the National Handicapped Registry, it is possible that some individuals with visual
impairment (especially those with mild visual impairment) were not registered in the Registry, leading
to misclassiﬁcation and shifting the results toward the null hypothesis. In addition, individuals with
visual ﬁeld defects and normal central visual acuity (e.g., patients with various diseases, such as
glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa) could have been included in the mild visual impairment group in
the present study, which might also have shifted the results toward the null hypothesis. Third, the
heterogeneity of the association between visual impairment and mortality by physical activity could be
partly due to residual confounding of health conditions, including those pertaining to visual function,
that limit physical activity, although we adjusted the analyses for extensive covariates. Fourth, the
results of no association between visual impairment and mortality among individuals who engage in
regular physical activity should be cautiously interpreted due to the small number of deaths, although
the point estimates for the associations between visual impairment and mortality were near or less
than 1, which suggest no association.
However, the present study also has some notable strengths. First, it provides new evidence
for issues (e.g., interaction between visual function and physical activity on mortality and stronger
association between visual impairment and mortality among those with lower income levels) that are
important for implementing health policies and designing public health interventions for the visually
impaired but have been investigated by a limited number of studies. Second, we considered the
severity of visual impairment and assessed the dose-response association between visual function and
mortality, which has not been comprehensively evaluated despite its importance in establishing causal
inference [35].

5. Conclusions
We found an independent association between visual impairment and higher mortality adjusted
for potential confounders, which was stronger among those with lower income levels. When we
performed stratiﬁed analyses by physical activity, the association between visual impairment and
mortality was found among individuals who did not engage in regular physical activity but not found
among those who engaged in regular physical activity. Because early detection of visual impairment
and eﬀective treatment of associated problems can maximize visual function for the visually impaired,
the present study suggests the importance of early detection of visual impairment and adequate
treatment of associated visual problems, especially among those with lower income levels. In addition,
the present study also suggests the importance of physical activity as a public health intervention for
individuals with visual impairment to lower adverse health outcomes such as mortality.
