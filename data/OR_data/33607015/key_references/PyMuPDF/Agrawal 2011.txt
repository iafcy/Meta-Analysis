Introduction
India is currently undergoing a demographic transition, 
with a shift to a higher proportion of elderly (increased 
from 5.6% in 1961 to 7.4% in 2001).(1) Increasing numbers 
of people are at risk of age‑related visual impairment as 
the elderly population increases.(2) Blindness and hearing 
impairment contribute heavily to the overall burden of 
impairment. More than half of all the impaired persons in 
India have either visual or hearing impairment.(3) Even as 
the elderly are at a higher risk of developing disabilities, 
it is also possible that the presence of single or multiple 
disabilities may increase the risk of death among them. 
The ‘at‑risk approach’, used in maternal and child health 
care, can be adopted for the care of the elderly as well.(4) 
Identification of groups among the elderly, who are at a 
greater risk of dying, will facilitate targeted interventions, 
with optimal utilization of the available resources. 
Among them, blindness and hearing impairment could 
be two possible predictors of mortality.
Various researchers in industrialized countries have 
studied the association of blindness and/or hearing 
impairment with mortality in the elderly.(5‑17) It was felt 
that it would be useful to study this association in India.
The objective of the present community‑based prospective 
study was to examine the association of blindness and

ABSTRACT
Background: Studies in developed nations have reported an association of blindness and hearing impairment with mortality in 
elderly persons. Objectives: To study the association of blindness and hearing impairment with mortality in a cohort of elderly 
persons in rural north India. Materials and Methods: This community‑based prospective study was conducted in eleven randomly 
selected villages, in Ballabgarh block, Haryana. A cohort of 1422 participants, of age 60 years and above, was examined at baseline, 
for their visual and hearing status. Data on the sociodemographic factors, various comorbidities, activities of daily living, and 
self‑rated health were recorded. Baseline data was collected for the period May 2008 to August 2008. Follow‑up data collection for 
mortality was completed in December 2009. The median follow‑up period was 518 days. Results: One hundred out of 1422 elderly 
(7.0%) participants died during the follow‑up period. Significant hazard ratios were found after adjustment for various comorbid 
conditions. On adjustment for sociodemographic factors (age, sex, and literacy), neither blindness nor hearing impairment was 
found to be significantly associated with mortality. After adjustment for all covariates in the study, hearing impairment (Hazard 
Ratio = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.29 – 3.54) was found to be significantly associated with mortality in the age group ≥70 years. Conclusions: 
This study demonstrated that hearing impairment was an independent risk factor for mortality in people aged ≥70 years. Similar 
studies with a longer period of follow‑up are required in India, to guide public health interventions.

Agrawal, et al.: Mortality in elderly in a rural area
hearing impairment with mortality in a cohort of elderly 
persons, aged 60 years or more, in a rural area.
Materials and Methods
The study was conducted in villages that are covered 
under the Intensive Field Practice Area (IFPA) of 
the Comprehensive Rural Health Services Project 
(CRHSP), Ballabgarh, District Faridabad, Haryana. It is 
a collaborative project between the All India Institute of 
Medical Sciences, New Delhi, and the state government 
of Haryana. The project caters to a population of about 
88000 persons in 28 villages. Health care services are 
provided by medical officers and their teams of health 
assistants and health workers, through a network of 
two Primary Health Centers and twelve sub‑centers. 
A Health Management Information System (HMIS) is in 
place, wherein, every person in these villages is allocated 
a unique 16‑digit number and is under continuous 
demographic surveillance.
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the 
Ethics Committee of the All India Institute of Medical 
Sciences, New Delhi, India. Written informed consent 
was obtained from the participants.
The relative risks reported in previous similar studies 
ranged from 1.15 to 2.9.(9,11) The December 2007, census 
data of this area had reported a death rate of 4.45% in 
elderly persons. Considering a relative risk of 2.0, and 
4.45% deaths among the non‑blind elderly persons, with a 
5% level of significance, and power of 80%, the estimated 
sample size was 1381 elderly persons. This sample size 
was calculated for an exposed: unexposed ratio of 1: 3.
The study population consisted of all elderly persons 
(age ≥60 years) living in the study villages at the time 
of baseline examination. Eleven villages were selected 
randomly. The total population of the selected villages 
was 23979, including 1465  (6.1%) elderly persons 
(CRHSP Ballabgarh — December 2007 census). Of these 
1465 persons, 1422 (97%) were recruited and followed up 
for the outcome measurement, with no loss to follow‑up. 
Of the remaining 43 persons, 17 refused to participate, 
16 were excluded from the study, as it was not possible 
to administer the study tests to them, and 10 could not 
be contacted despite three visits to their homes. Baseline 
data collection was carried out from May 2008 to August 
2008, and follow‑up data collection was completed in the 
month of December 2009.
A questionnaire was administered to all the 
study participants, to collect information on the 
sociodemographic details, history of associated 
morbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary 
artery disease, stroke, and any orthopedic impairment), 
data on self‑rated health, and feeding and dressing. 
The questionnaire was pretested, and the necessary 
improvements were made. It was developed in English, 
translated into Hindi, and then back‑translated into 
English to check for the correctness of the translation. 
It was administered to the participants in Hindi, by a 
single trained investigator. The history of five of the 
above‑mentioned specific morbidities was elicited by 
asking the question, “Are you suffering from any of these 
illnesses, or have you taken treatment for any of them?” 
Orthopedic impairment was assessed by observation 
as well. Visual acuity was recorded with a Snellen’s 
vision chart. The vision was recorded at a distance of 
6 m separately for each eye; with distant glasses, if any. 
Blindness was defined as a visual acuity of less than 
6/60 in the better eye, with available correction. For 
hearing assessment, all participants were administered 
the Whisper test first, and subsequently examined 
with the Rinne’s test and Weber’s test, using a 512 Hz 
tuning fork by the investigator. The Whisper test was 
calibrated using the audiometer, before administration 
to the participants. The initial calibration and fortnightly 
appraisals during the period of data collection were done 
under the supervision of a faculty from the department 
of the ear, nose, and throat (ENT), All India Institute of 
Medical Sciences, New Delhi.
All participants found blind or hearing impaired at 
the time of baseline examination were referred to 
Ophthalmology and ENT clinics at the comprehensive 
rural health services project (CRHSP), Ballabgarh 
Hospital for Management. These participants were 
contacted again at the time of follow‑up examination. 
They were asked about any improvement of visual/
auditory status during the follow‑up period. Data for 
the outcome variable, that is, all‑cause mortality during 
the follow‑up period, were collected from death registers 
maintained by health workers of the sub‑centers covering 
the respective villages. Accredited social health activists 
(ASHAs) and Anganwadi workers of the respective 
villages were also contacted to collect data on the deaths 
that occurred after the last visit of the health worker. 
Furthermore, the mortality data were cross‑checked 
for deficiencies/discrepancies, if any, with the Health 
Management Information System (HMIS) at CRHSP, 
Ballabgarh.
Data were entered in an MS Excel sheet. Analysis was 
done using STATA 9.0 (College Station, Texas, USA). 
Data were presented as number (percentage). The 
association of the demographic variables and various 
self‑reported morbidities, with mortality, was compared 
using the chi‑square test. The Cox proportional hazard 
models, both univariate and multivariate, were used to 
find the hazard of blinding and hearing impairment on 
mortality. The results were reported as Hazard Ratio

Results
Results of the 1422 participants — 58.1% were in the 
age group of 60 to 69  years. About half (51.7%) of 
the participants were female and three‑fourth of the 
participants (75.5%) had had no schooling. Sixty‑two 
(4.4%) participants were dependent on others for 
dressing and 53  (3.9%) for feeding. Hypertension 
was reported by 10.7% and diabetes mellitus by 6.9% 
participants [Table 1]. Their own health was reported 
as fair by 68.3%, poor by 14.9%, good by 13.5%, very 
poor by 1.8%, and excellent by 1.5% of the participants.
There were no out‑migrations among participants 
during the follow‑up period. No participant reported 
improvement of vision or hearing impairment during 
the follow‑up period.
One hundred out of the 1422 (7%) participants died 
during the follow‑up period. The follow‑up period for 
participants ranged from a minimum of three days to a 
maximum of 567 days, with the median follow‑up period 
being 518 days.
Out of 134 blind participants, 15  (11.2%) died, as 
compared to 85 deaths (6.6%) out of 1288 participants 
with normal vision (P=0.048). The percentage of deaths 
was significantly (P=0.001) higher in participants with 
hearing impairment (13.3%), as compared to participants 
with no hearing impairment (5.9%).
After adjustment for all the covariates (age, sex, 
literacy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary 
artery disease, stroke, orthopedic impairment, dressing, 
feeding, self‑rated health), neither blindness nor hearing 
impairment was found to be significantly associated with 
mortality. Adjustment for only morbidities had no effect 
on the crude hazard ratios [Table 2].
On further exploratory analysis by age and sex, hearing 
impairment was found to be significantly associated with 
mortality in the age group ≥70 years with a Hazard Ratio 
of 2.13 (1.29 – 3.54; 95% CI). The rest of the associations 
were insignificant. Hazard ratios for blindness in the age 
group 60 – 69 years could not be calculated, as there were 
no events in that group [Table 3].
Discussion
In this cohort study, we investigated the association 
of blindness and hearing impairment with mortality 
in the elderly age group in a rural area. A few studies 
conducted across the world have addressed the same 
study question, albeit in urban areas.(5‑17) In the Indian 
context, as more than two‑thirds of the population is 
residing in rural areas, this is an important consideration.
Univariate analysis revealed an association of blindness 
and hearing impairment with mortality. This corroborates 
the evidence generated from similar previous studies.(5‑17) 
The male gender appeared to be protected for blindness 
as compared to the female gender in this univariate 
analysis. However, no association existed between 
blindness and mortality, after adjustment was made for 
sociodemographic factors (age, sex, and literacy). This 
finding is not in agreement with the findings from the 
previous studies. One of the possible reasons for the 
differing results could be the different sociodemographic 
factors for which the adjustments were made.(5‑12)
In the study by Wang et al., from Australia, adjustments 
were made for height, weight, body mass index, and 
home ownership, apart from age and sex,(5) and in 
another study by Lee et al. from USA, adjustments were 
made for age, sex, race, and marital status.(7)
Adjustments only for the selected morbidities, had no 
effect on the observed association between blindness and 
mortality. This was in support of the evidence generated 
by various similar previous studies.(5,6,8‑10,12) However, 
in some studies, the observed association between 
blindness and mortality was no longer present, at least 
in some subgroups, once the adjustments were made 
for the identified confounders.(7,11) This could be due 
to a difference between various potential confounders 
adjusted for in the studies, and different methods used 
for their ascertainment.

Hearing impairment remained associated with 
mortality; however, the results became insignificant 
once adjustments were made for the sociodemographic 
factors, especially age. This was in agreement with one 
study conducted in Canada by Ostbye et al.(15)
Hearing impairment was found to be significantly 
associated with mortality even after adjustment for all 
the potential confounders in the age group of 70 years 
or more. Similar significant associations were reported 
in the same age group in one previous study in Italy.(16)
It is possible that hearing impairment is a marker of 
accelerated aging, and hence, is indicative of a greater 
risk of death in those who are hearing impaired.
Similarly, in a study by Lam et al., in the United States, 
significant association was found between hearing 
impairment and mortality among a group of women 
belonging to the non‑white, non African–American race 
(including Asians, among others).(14)
A couple of limitations need to be mentioned. First, 
the period of person‑years of follow‑up in the present 
study was smaller in comparison to other similar 
studies, mostly due to the lower duration of follow‑up. 
Second, the method of ascertainment of the comorbid 
conditions was self‑reported by the participants, which 
could have resulted in some diagnostic gap for the said 
morbidities.
To conclude, the results of the present study showed 
that elderly persons aged ≥70 years, residing in the rural 
area, who suffered from hearing impairment, were at 
increased risk of mortality, as compared to persons 
without this impairment. Sociodemographic factors 
(age, sex, and literacy) had a strong confounding effect. 
However, the presence of various comorbid conditions 
(hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, 
stroke, and orthopedic impairment) had no effect on this 
association.
The presence of hearing impairment in the age group 
≥70 years should be considered as a risk factor for 
mortality, and more efforts for mortality reduction should 
be directed toward this ‘at‑risk group’ through screening.
With the increase in the elderly population in India, 
similar studies with longer follow‑up periods are 
warranted, to generate an evidence‑base for public health 
interventions.
