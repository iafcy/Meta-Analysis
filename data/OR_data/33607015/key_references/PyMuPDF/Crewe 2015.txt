Purpose:
To determine whether blindness in older people is associated with increased health service use
and mortality.
Design:
Retrospective matched cohort study from July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2010.
Participants:
A blind cohort 65 years of age and older from a volunteer blind register and a cohort of age-
and gender-matched controls selected randomly from the Western Australian electoral roll.
Methods:
Person-level linked hospital, emergency department (ED), mental health, and death records for the
blind and control cohorts were used. Generalized estimating equations assuming a negative binomial distribution
were used to estimate relative rates of hospital admissions, lengths of stay, and mortality after adjusting for
sociodemographic variables and comorbidity. Emergency department and mental health service visits also were
quantiﬁed.
Main Outcome Measures:
Relative rates of hospital admissions, lengths of stay, and mortality, as well as
crude proportions of ED and mental health service visits.
Results:
The blind cohort comprised 1726 individuals alongside 1726 matched controls; 39% were men, and
the mean age was 83 years. Combined, the cohorts accumulated a total of 34 130 hospital admissions amounting
to 201 867 bed-days. After adjusting for the principal reason for hospital admission and comorbidity, the blind
cohort was admitted to the hospital 11% (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 6%e17%) more often than the control
cohort. The blind cohort also stayed in the hospital longer than the controls, but this effect varied by age. Blind
participants 65 to 69 years of age spent 88% more days (95% CI, 27%e178%) in the hospital compared with
age-matched controls, whereas there was no difference in length of stay between the cohorts by 80 years of age
(rate ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.97e1.25). A larger proportion of the blind cohort visited a hospital ED and accessed
mental health services compared with the control cohort.
Conclusions:
Health service use is increased for the elderly blind compared with age-matched controls after
accounting for comorbidity. The elderly blind have more hospital admissions, ED visits, and mental health-related
visits. The younger elderly blind stay longer in hospital. However, there was no evidence of worse mortality
outcomes after adjusting for comorbidity. Ophthalmology 2015;122:2344-2350 ª 2015 by the American Academy

Blindness is principally a disease of aging in developed
countries. In Western Australia (WA), the prevalence of
blindness in persons 50 years of age and older is estimated at
0.4%1 and is expected to increase with an aging population. It
has been well established that visual impairment in the elderly
is associated with reduced independence, physical mobility,
social connectivity, and activities of daily living.1,2 An
increased prevalence of both physical and mental comor-
bidities, particularly anxiety and depression, also have been
reported in the elderly with vision loss.3e5
Despite well-documented data on the incidence, preva-
lence, and causes of vision loss and blindness1,6,7 and the
associated comorbidities, little information exists on how
vision impairment impacts health service use in the elderly
blind. Several studies have reported poor vision in the elderly
as a risk factor for single and recurrent falls8 and for hospital
admissions for falls.9,10 Integrated mental health inter-
ventions in an outpatient setting have shown improvements in
depressive symptoms.11 However, the extent of hospital
admissions, length of hospital stays, emergency department
(ED) presentations, mental health outpatient contacts, and
mortality outcomes in the elderly blind relative to their
sighted contemporaries has not been quantiﬁed.
Herein we report the ﬁndings from a retrospective cohort
study that used linked population-based administrative data
sets to compare health service use and mortality outcomes in
individuals who were registered legally blind at 65 years of
age and older with an age-matched sighted cohort. The
Western Australia Data Linkage System is a validated pro-
cess that creates links that allows records from multiple
health-related data sets to be brought together for all in-
dividuals living in WA.12 Western Australia is the largest

state of Australia with a population of 2.5 million, with most
of the population living in the southwest corner that includes
the only major metropolitan city, Perth.
Methods
Individuals 65 years of age or older at the time they were ﬁrst
registered as legally blind were identiﬁed from the voluntary reg-
ister of the Association for the Blind of Western Australia from
January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2009, and formed the blind
cohort. The terms blind and blindness used throughout refer to
legal blindness in Australia which is deﬁned as having a best-
corrected visual acuity of more than 1 logarithm of the minimum
angle of resolution or a visual ﬁeld of less than 10 in diameter, or
a combination of both reduced visual acuity and ﬁeld restriction,
resulting in an equivalent level of vision loss in the better eye. We
previously validated the accuracy of the clinical ophthalmic in-
formation on the register and established that approximately 50%
of the eligible blind in WA were registered.1,13
A 1:1 age-matched (2 years) and gender-matched control
cohort was selected randomly from the state electoral roll. Because
voting is compulsory in Australia, the electoral roll is considered
representative of the adult population. The control selection and de-
identiﬁed extraction of all hospital morbidity, ED, mental health
outpatient, and death registration records for both cohorts from July
1, 1999, through June 30, 2010, were performed by the Data
Linkage Branch, Department of Health of Western Australia.14
Each blind participant was assigned an index date that corre-
sponded to the date of conﬁrmed blindness from the blind registry.
The corresponding age- and gender-matched control was assigned
the same index date after conﬁrming they were still alive at the
index date. The hospital morbidity data were manipulated so that
multiple episodes of care within the same hospital admission were
combined into a single hospital stay record. Episodes of care fol-
lowed by a transfer to another hospital also were combined into a
single admission record. The length of stay for each admission was
deﬁned as the latest discharge date minus the earliest date of
admission plus 1. The exposure time that an individual was at risk
of a hospital stay was deﬁned as time from July 1, 1999, through
June 30, 2010, or until date of death if earlier.
The principal reasons for each hospital admission were cate-
gorized into 218 Clinical Classiﬁcation Systems groups using
published International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th Edition,
Clinical Classiﬁcation Systems translation codes.15 Comorbidity
associated with each hospital admission was identiﬁed from up
to 21 codiagnosis ﬁelds in the hospital record and was classiﬁed
as the presence or absence of the 30 different Elixhauser
comorbidity conditions associated with increased risk of in-
hospital death.16 The proportion of participants with hospital
admissions via the ED, any record of spending time in an
inpatient psychiatric unit, and death during the study period also
were determined.
The Accessibility and Remoteness Index of Australia was used
to describe geographical accessibility to health services.17 This
index uses information about populations based on their access,
by road, to service centers (towns) of various sizes, and ranges
from major cities to the very remote. The Index of Relative
Socio-economic Disadvantage was based on the most recent resi-
dential postcode.18 This index combines census collected data on
income, education, and unemployment of people and families, as
well as dwellings within an area, and ranks these areas on a
scale of relative disadvantage.
Age was classiﬁed into 10-year age groups to demonstrate
overall trends. Being recorded as married or in a de facto relationship
at the time of the 3 most recent hospital admissions was classiﬁed
as partnered. Identiﬁcation with being aboriginal or of Torres Strait
Islander ethnicity on any hospital record was classiﬁed as being
indigenous. Limited demographic information was available for
participants who were not admitted to a hospital at all during the
follow-up period and were classiﬁed as unknown where necessary.
Statistical Analysis
Bivariate associations of the various demographic factors and blind
status were tested using Pearson’s chi-square test for proportions,
t tests for normally distributed continuous variables, and the Wil-
coxon rank-sum test for medians. Because of multiple testing (218
identiﬁed diagnostic groups, 30 comorbidity groups), Bonferroni-
adjusted critical P values were used when appropriate. Bivariate
tests of associations with count variables were performed using
negative binomial regression models with a single independent
variable. All hospital admissions (including renal dialysis) were
included in all regression analyses.
The association of being blind with hospital use was investi-
gated using regression modeling adjusted for potential con-
founders, in particular comorbidity, because of the known
association of blindness with increased morbidity. There were
several steps involved in the modelling process. First, the records
of each participant were collapsed such that the total number of
hospital admissions, combined total length of stay (number of bed-
days), and the presence or absence of all principal diagnostic and
comorbidity groups at any time during follow-up were summarized
onto a single record per participant. The length of follow-up
(exposure time) for each participant also was recorded. Second,
each of the large number of possible principal diagnostic and co-
morbidity combinations were reduced further into 2 empirically
derived variables for each of the 2 main outcome measures: total
number of admissions and the total number of bed-days. To create
these empirically derived variables, each outcome was modeled
using negative binomial regression models that included either all
218 identiﬁed principal diagnostic groups or all 30 comorbidity
groups and accounted for exposure time. Based on these 4 models,
the predicted total number of admissions and predicted total length
of stay per person were estimated for each covariate pattern rep-
resented by the different possible combinations of either the prin-
cipal diagnoses or comorbidity variables.
Finally, the effect of blindness on the 2 main outcome measures
was estimated in 2 further models that included the newly created
empirically derived variables containing the predicted outcome
based on principal diagnosis and comorbidity. Other variables
included in the ﬁnal modeling process were age, gender, marital
status, accessibility to services, and whether the participant un-
derwent renal dialysis or chemotherapy or died during the follow-
up period. To account for any similarity (lack of independence)
between blind participants and their matched control, generalized
estimating equations assuming a negative binomial distribution
were used to estimate rate ratios after accounting for exposure time.
Mortality rates were age standardized using the 2009 WA
population. Poisson regression was used to model mortality rates.
Analysis was carried out using IBM PASW software version 18
(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and Stata software version 13
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). This study was approved by
the Human Research Ethics Committees of Curtin University and
the Western Australia Department of Health.
Results
The blind cohort consisted of 1726 people conﬁrmed as being
legally blind and older than 65 years with 1726 age- and
gender-matched persons in the control cohort. The mean age was

83 years (standard deviation, 7 years) and 39% were male.
Demographic characteristics of the cohorts are summarized in
Table 1. More of the blind cohort lived in major urban areas
compared with the control cohort, but there were no differences
in socioeconomic status, marital status, or aboriginal ethnicity
observed between the cohorts.
Cause of Blindness
The most frequent single causes of blindness in the blind cohort
were age-related macular degeneration (n ¼ 1096; 63.5%) followed
by glaucoma (n ¼ 98; 5.7%) and diabetic retinopathy (n ¼ 47;
2.7%). Other less frequent single causes of blindness were optic
neuropathy (n ¼ 33), retinal dystrophies (n ¼ 24), corneal condi-
tions (n ¼ 14), lens conditions (n ¼ 15), and occlusions (n ¼ 14).
Multiple causes of blindness were observed in 246 people (14.3%),
with almost half being the result of macular degeneration and
glaucoma with or without cataract (n ¼ 118; 48.0%). There were 77
people (4.5%) for whom a deﬁnitive cause of blindness could not
be determined because of lack of information on the blind register.
Overall Health Service Use
The average number of hospital admissions per person did not vary
signiﬁcantly between the blind and control cohorts after taking
length of follow-up into account (Table 2). However, after
excluding
admissions
for
renal
dialysis,
the
blind
cohort
experienced more nonrenal hospital admissions than the control
cohort. On average, each person in the blind cohort stayed in the
hospital longer than persons in the control cohort regardless of
whether
days
of
renal
dialysis
were
excluded.
A
higher
proportion of persons in the blind cohort attended a hospital ED
and received public mental health outpatient care over the study
period compared with the control cohort. Overall, there were 208
individuals who did not attend the hospital during the study
period, but this did not vary between the cohorts. There was no
difference in the number of patients in each cohort who had day
admissions for routine renal dialysis or chemotherapy or who
spent time in a hospital psychiatric unit.
Hospital Admissions
Combined, there were 34 309 hospital admissions during the follow-
up period with just over half (53%) attributed to the blind cohort
(Table 3). The distribution of total admissions per person was highly
skewed because 19 patients had a combined total of 7450
admissions for renal dialysis. Just 3% (n ¼ 483) of hospital
admission
records
for
the
blind
cohort
included
blindness
(International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Tenth Edition, code,
H54.0) as a diagnosis or codiagnosis. A higher proportion of
admissions by persons in the blind cohort were via the ED
compared with the control cohort.
There were 14 principal diagnostic groups that accounted for
more than half (51%) of all hospital admissions for both cohorts
combined (Table 3). Admissions for chronic renal failure were the
most numerous, although the relative proportions did not vary
between the blind and control cohorts. Of the most frequent
diagnostic groups, there were more admissions for diabetes with
complications, pulmonary disease, and anemia in the blind cohort
compared with controls. In contrast, there were more admissions
related to cataracts and cancer treatments in the control cohort. Of
the less frequently observed diagnostic groups, persons in the blind
cohort also were more likely to be admitted with immunity
disorders, disorders of the jaw and teeth, schizophrenia and related
disorders, glaucoma, retinal detachments, eye infections, and
peripheral and visceral atherosclerosis (all P < 0.00023, data not
shown).
Comorbid conditions recorded at the time of admission were
classiﬁed into 30 Elixhauser comorbid conditions (Table 4,
available at www.aaojournal.org). Persons in the blind cohort
were signiﬁcantly more likely to have had hypertension, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, or diabetes with complications
recorded as comorbidity compared with the control cohort.
The mean number of admissions that excluded renal dialysis
were signiﬁcantly higher in the blind cohort compared with the
control cohort, but there was no difference between the cohorts for
number of admissions that included renal dialysis (Table 2). To
determine if these differences remained after adjusting for the
social, demographic, and clinical variation between the cohorts, a
multivariate regression model was constructed (Table 5). The
blind cohort had 11% (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 6%e17%)
more hospital admissions than the control cohort after accounting
for
the
number
of
admissions
predicted
by
the
principal
diagnosis along with comorbidity, renal dialysis, chemotherapy,
and whether participants died during the follow-up period (hospi-
tal admission rates are known to increase in last year of life).
Women had 9% fewer admissions than men, and those living in
outer regional areas tended toward more hospital admissions. So-
cioeconomic status and marital status were not associated with the
number of hospital admissions.

Length of Stay (Bed-Days)
The combined blind and control cohorts spent a total of 201 867
bed-days in hospital over the 11-year study period. Renal dialysis
accounted for 7476 (3.7%) of total bed-days. The unadjusted mean
number of days spent in the hospital by each person over the
11-year period on average was greater for the blind cohort
compared with controls regardless of whether renal dialysis was
excluded (Table 2).
The number of days spent in the hospital for different medical
conditions varied between the cohorts (Table 3). Almost 5% of
bed-days in the hospital for the blind cohort was for complica-
tions of diabetes compared with only 2% of the control cohort
bed-days. The blind cohort also had an increased proportion of
bed-days in hospitals for acute cerebrovascular disease, lower
limb fractures, chronic lung disease, heart conditions, and mood
disorders compared with the control cohort. Interestingly, the
control cohort had a higher proportion of bed-days for hip and
other fractures compared with the blind cohort. There was no
difference between the cohorts in the proportion of bed-days for
chronic renal failure, back problems, or dementia and related
conditions.
Regression models showed that blindness developing after 65
years of age was associated with an average 10% increase in the
average number of days in the hospital over the study period
compared with the control cohort after accounting for clinical
features (Table 5). There was evidence that this increase in the blind
cohort varied by age (interaction term P ¼ 0.004). Blind persons 65
to 69 years of age spent 88% (95% CI, 27%e178%) more days in
the hospital compared with controls of the same age, and blind
persons 70 to 79 years of age spent 23% (95% CI, 3%e48%)
more days in the hospital, whereas by 80 to 89 years of age,
there were no signiﬁcant differences in the mean number of bed-
days between the blind and control cohorts (rate ratio, 1.10; 95%
CI, 0.97e1.25). The number of days in the hospital also was
increased for those without a partner at last admission, older per-
sons, and those living in outer regional and remote areas.
Mortality
Of the study population, 31% (1068) died between the index date
and the study end date, with more deaths in the blind cohort
(n ¼ 577) than the control cohort (n ¼ 491; Table 2). The mortality
rate for those older than 65 years was 79 per 1000 person-years for
the blind cohort (95% CI, 69e89) and 58 per 1000 person-years for
the control cohort (95% CI, 51e66) when age was standardized
to the WA population, a 20% increased death rate (95% CI,
7e135) for aged blind persons. However, the observed difference
in mortality rates between the blind and control cohorts dis-
appeared after adjusting for comorbid conditions in a Poisson
regression model that also included age and gender (rate, 1.08;
95% CI, 0.95e1.21).
Discussion
This study is unique in that it used linked health data sets to
evaluate the use of health care services by a large cohort of
blind elderly persons. Overall, the blind elderly went to the
hospital more frequently, more often as an emergency, and
stayed longer, particularly for those younger than 80 years,
and were more likely to attend an ED and access mental
health outpatient services.
It is well established that blindness is associated with
increased comorbidity, with the vision loss itself often a
consequence of underlying chronic disease.4,19 Therefore, it
is not unexpected that the elderly blind would have increased
health service use. However, our observed differences
remained after taking comorbidity and the principal reason
for hospitalization into account. This suggests that blindness-
related factors such as loss of functional ability to carry out
activities of daily living and increased requirement for social
and community support could result in a lower threshold for

hospital admissions and subsequent longer stays independent
of comorbidity. It is also likely that ﬁndings are subject to
some residual confounding from unmeasured aspects of co-
morbidity, such as severity, a limitation that can be overcome
with a prospective randomized study.
The blind cohort spent more days in the hospital with mood
disorders and had more contact with public mental health
outpatient services compared with the control cohort. These
data support previous reports of signiﬁcant levels of mental
illness and depression, estimated to affect up to one-third of
severely visually impaired and blind people.20 Generally, only
severe affective disorder is treated in an acute care hospital
setting, so the extent of depression in either the blind or
control cohort is likely an underestimate. Rather, the present
data represent the severe end of psychiatric conditions.
Our ﬁndings that the blind cohort spent more days in the
hospital for lower limb fractures (excluding neck of femur),
but proportionally fewer days in the hospital for neck of femur
and other fractures, compared with controls is surprising. It is
well known that vision impairment is a risk factor for falls and
injuries,21,22 but our ﬁndings seem to suggest that the blind
elderly cohort experienced a different type of fracture proﬁle
than the controls. This ﬁnding remains to be veriﬁed in a more
detailed study, but if it was this case, it could assist with
design of rehabilitation programs targeting the blind.
We previously reported higher mortality rates in working-
age blind people (age range, 18e65 years) when compared
with normally sighted and age-matched controls.23 Here, the
increased crude mortality in elderly blind was explained
entirely by the increased comorbidity. This suggests that
blindness per se did not increase the death rate in the elderly
blind,
but
rather
the
combination
with
associated
comorbidity. This is in contrast to other observational
studies that report greater excess mortality in the elderly
with vision loss.24,25 These studies were able to adjust for
functional ability, which we could not, a limitation of our

study. However, these previous studies were restricted to self-
reporting of a limited set of comorbid conditions, whereas we
were able to account for a large range of comorbidity.
The strength of the present study was the ability to combine
large health-related data sets at the individual person level
across the entire state population, avoiding bias limitations
associated with single-center studies. To the best of our
knowledge,nootherdataareavailableonthehealthserviceuse
of such a large cohort of elderly legally blind persons. We
previously validated the clinical information in the register of
the Western Australia Association for the Blind and found it
accurately recorded the level of vision loss.13 However, only
50% of those eligible were actually registered with the
Western Australia Association for the Blind,1 and thus
misclassiﬁcation bias of a blind individual into the control
cohort
theoretically
was
possible,
although
unlikely.
Although we believe that the blind elderly cohort was
broadly representative, those registered as blind were more
likely to have accessed a range of rehabilitation services
compared with those not registered, and the impact of this on
health service use currently is unknown. It is particularly
difﬁcult to assess because of the poor coding of blindness as
a comorbid condition. Only 3% of hospital admission
records for the blind cohort listed blindness as a comorbidity.
These data suggest that blindness is not only a signiﬁcant
burden for the individual, but also the health care system, from
being prone to more comorbidity and potentially the condition
ofblindnessitself. Programs improving self-esteemthatenable
and encourage social connectivity may reduce depression and
related mental health problems. Further research is required to
provide insight into whether encouraging and directing the
blind elderly toward existing, community-based rehabilitation
programs reduces the frequency of emergency presentations
and length of time spent in hospitals.

*Conditional on having at least 1 hospital admission during the study period (excluded 208 persons with no hospital admissions).
yRefers to relative change in either the number of admissions or number of days, with each increase of 1 in the empirically derived variables that predicted
the number of events (admissions or bed days) based on principal diagnosis and comorbidity alone (see “Methods” for more details). Empirically derived
prediction variables were entered as continuous variables and ﬁnal rate ratios are interpretable only as an adjustment for comorbidity and principal diagnosis.
