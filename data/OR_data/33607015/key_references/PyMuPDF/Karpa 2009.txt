Objective: To investigate pathways from visual impair-
ment to increased all-cause mortality in older persons.
Methods: The Blue Mountains Eye Study examined 3654
persons 49 years and older (82.4% response) during 1992-
1994 and after 5 and 10 years. Australian National Death
Index data confirmed deaths until 2005. Visual impair-
ment was defined as presenting, correctable, and non-
correctable, using better-eye visual acuity. Associations
between visual impairment and mortality risk were es-
timated using Cox regression and structural equation
modeling.
Results: After 13 years, 1273 participants had died. Ad-
justing for mortality risk markers, higher mortality was
associated with noncorrectable visual impairment (haz-
ard ratio [HR], 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-
1.75). This association was stronger for ages younger than
75 years (HR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.42-4.69). Structural equa-
tion modeling revealed greater effects of noncorrectable
visual impairment on mortality risk (HR, 5.25; 95% CI,
1.97-14.01 for baseline ages 75 years), with both di-
rect (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.11-4.23) and indirect (HR, 2.43;
95% CI, 1.17-5.03) effects. Of mortality risk markers ex-
amined, only disability in walking demonstrated a sig-
nificant indirect pathway for the link between visual im-
pairment and mortality.
Conclusions: Visual impairment predicted mortality by
both direct and indirect pathways, particularly for per-
sons younger than 75 years with noncorrectable visual
impairment. Disability in walking, which can substan-
tially influence general health, represented a major in-
direct pathway.

ISUAL IMPAIRMENT HAS CON-
sistently been associated
with a higher risk of dy-
ing.1-8 Visual impairment is
also reportedly associated
with many factors also linked to increased
mortality. These include unintentional in-
jury,9,10 reduced walking speed,9,11 depres-
sion,2,11,12 lower body mass index (BMI),13,14
increased risk of falls,9,15 self-rated health,16
self-reported difficulty in physical activ-
ity,11,17 systemic inflammation,14,18 cardio-
vascular disease,11,14 dementia,17 and can-
cer.19,20 Correction for these “confounders”
has been found to attenuate the associa-
tion between visual impairment and mor-
tality, but the mechanisms behind the as-
sociation between visual impairment and
mortality remain to be determined.
Because of the complex interactions of
other mortality risk factors with visual im-
pairment, correcting for these covariates
using traditional regression techniques
could underestimate the total effect of vi-
sual impairment on mortality.21 For ex-
ample,personswithvisualimpairmentmay
be more likely to use walking aids be-
cause of an increased risk or fear of fall-
ing. If true, then adjustment for the use of
walking aids, an independent marker of
mortality, would underestimate the effect
of visual impairment. This covariate is an
intermediate variable, a variable that lies
on the causal pathway between visual im-
pairmentandmortality22sothatsimplead-
justment for such variables in a tradi-
tional statistical model is not appropriate.
Structural equation modeling (SEM) is
a modern statistical method that permits
modeling of complex relationships that are
difficulttoestimateusingtraditionalregres-
siontechniques.23 Structuralequationmod-
eling facilitates the examination and quan-
tification of direct pathways and indirect
pathways via intermediate variables. Esti-
mates for such variables can be summated
to determine the total indirect effect of the
variable of interest on the outcome. Add-

ing the indirect and direct effects then estimates the total
effect of the variable of interest on the outcome. To our
knowledge, only 1 study has used SEM to examine the as-
sociations between visual impairment and mortality.24 This
large population survey relied on self-reporting or proxy
reporting of visual impairment and comorbidities. The au-
thors reported that in addition to a direct effect on mor-
tality, visual impairment increased mortality risk indi-
rectly through intermediate variables self-rated health and
disability.24 To confirm the findings by Christ et al,24 we
aimed, in an older Australian population-based cohort, to
examine associations between visual impairment, mortal-
ity risk markers, and the 13-year risk of mortality using a
SEM approach.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION
The Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES) is a population-based
cohort study of vision and common eye diseases in a suburban
Australian population 49 years and older at baseline. The study
was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the
University of Sydney and was conducted adhering to the te-
nets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Signed informed consent
was obtained from all the participants at each examination.
DATA COLLECTION
Survey methods and procedures have been described previ-
ously.25 Briefly, baseline examinations of 3654 residents older
than 49 years were conducted during 1992-1994 (BMES 1, 82.4%
participation rate). Of the baseline participants, 2335 (75.1%
of survivors) returned for 5-year follow-up examinations dur-
ing 1997-1999 (BMES 2), and 1952 participants (53.4% of the
original cohort, or 76.6% of survivors) returned for 10-year fol-
low-up examinations during 2002-2004 (BMES 3). Medical and
smoking histories were determined by interviewer-admin-
istered questionnaire at baseline. A history of angina, myocar-
dial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, or can-
cer was determined by responses to questions starting with “Has
a doctor advised you that you have . . . ?” History of smoking
was defined as never, past, or current smoking. Current smok-
ers included those who had stopped smoking within the past
year. Weight in kilograms, height in meters, and systolic and
diastolic blood pressures were also recorded at baseline.
To identify and confirm persons who died after the base-
line examination, demographic information, including sur-
name, first and second names, sex, and date of birth of the 3654
participants, was cross-matched with Australian National Death
Index data for deaths to the end of 2005.26 A probabilistic rec-
ord linkage package was used, adopting a multiple-pass pro-
cedure in which both data sets were grouped based on differ-
ent characteristics (eg, date of birth, name, sex) each time.
Matches were divided into exact and nonexact. All nonexact
matched records were examined manually and accepted if there
was only 1 nonexact matched characteristic that was not criti-
cal. Information provided by family members during fol-
low-up was also included if the participant was reported to have
died on or before December 2005.
DEFINITIONS
Classification of hypertension was based on the 2003 World
Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension
guidelines.27 Participants were classified as having hyperten-
sion stage 1 if systolic blood pressure was 140 to 159 mm Hg
or if diastolic blood pressure was 90 to 99 mm Hg. Partici-
pants were classified as having hypertension stage 2 if they were
previously diagnosed with hypertension and were using anti-
hypertensive medications, if systolic blood pressure was 160
mm Hg or greater, or if diastolic blood pressure was 100 mm Hg
or greater at examination. Body mass index was calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, with
less than 20 defined as low. Disability in walking at baseline
was assessed as present if the participant was observed by a
trained examiner to have walking difficulties or used walking
aids or a wheelchair.
Visual acuity (VA) was assessed using a logMAR chart. Vi-
sual acuity was initially assessed with patients wearing their
current eyeglasses. If initial VA was less than 54 letters read
correctly (20/20 Snellen equivalent), refraction was per-
formed. Visual impairment was categorized as presenting vi-
sual impairment (PVI), VA less than 20/40 Snellen equivalent
(39lettersreadcorrectly)inthebettereyeusingcurrentglasses;
correctable visual impairment (CVI), PVI correctable to 20/40
Snellen equivalent or better by subjective refraction; and non-
correctable visual impairment (NCVI), PVI correctable to worse
than 20/40 Snellen equivalent in the better eye after subjective
refraction.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software ver-
sion 9.13 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) and Mplus.28
Simple statistics included t tests for comparing means and 2
tests for comparing proportions. Cox regression models were
used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence in-
tervals (CIs). Multivariable-adjusted models included vari-
ables found significantly associated with mortality after age ad-
justment. These were history of acute myocardial infarction,
stroke, angina and hypertension, current smoking, low BMI,
cancer, diabetes, walking disability, home ownership, tertiary
education, and self-rated health. Additional stratified analyses
were conducted by age group (75 years vs 75 years) to as-
sess whether the impact from visual impairment was stronger
on premature mortality of the relatively younger age group at
baseline (75 years). A P value of less than .05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
Structural equation modeling pathway analysis23 was used
to model the relationship between visual impairment, sur-
vival, and covariables found significantly associated with mor-
tality by Cox regression. The SEM was fit using the Mplus28
statistical package with maximum likelihood and Monte Carlo
integration methods. Standard errors were calculated using the
delta method and hazard rates obtained from the coefficients
by exponentiation. The covariables used in the model were his-
tory of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, angina and hyper-
tension, current smoking, low BMI, cancer, diabetes, walking
disability, home ownership, tertiary education, and self-rated
health. The multiple potential pathways to mortality are shown
in Figure 1. Each variable was adjusted for age and sex. The
indirect effect of visual impairment was then calculated for each
covariable by multiplying the effects of that covariable on mor-
tality and visual impairment on the covariable. Models were
simplified by removing indirect pathways for individual co-
variables that were not significant at the P value level of .10.
The total indirect effect of visual impairment could then be cal-
culated by summating the coefficients of the estimated indi-
rect effects of each mediating variable and then converting to
HRs. The total estimated effect of visual impairment on mor-
tality was calculated by summating the coefficients of the in-
direct and direct effects and then converting to HRs.

RESULTS
STUDY POPULATION
AsofDecember31,2005,1273BMESparticipantshaddied.
Table 1 shows the distribution of known mortality risk
markers in persons with and without visual impairment.
Comparedwiththosewithnormalvision,participantswith
NCVI at baseline were more likely to be female, older (age
75years),andunderweight.PersonswithCVIweremore
likely to be older (age 75 years), but there was no dif-
ference in the proportions of women or persons with low
BMI. They were more likely to have a self-reported his-
tory of angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, low
self-rated health, and an observed difficulty in walking or
use of walking aids. They were less likely to have tertiary
education or to own their home. There were no signifi-
cant differences in the proportions of current smokers or
historyofhypertensionordiabetesbetweenthegroupswith
and without visual impairment.
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN
VISUAL IMPAIRMENT AND MORTALITY
Table 2 shows all-cause mortality rates and mortality risk
after age and sex adjustment, which were higher in per-
sons with visual impairment compared with those with
normal vision. This difference was greater in persons
younger than 75 years compared with those 75 years and
older at baseline. Persons younger than 75 years with vi-
sualimpairmentwereatgreaterriskofPVI,CVI,andNCVI
(PVI: HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.32-2.17; CVI: HR, 1.60; 95%
CI, 1.23-2.09; NCVI: HR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.42-4.69). The
associations for all ages combined remained either signifi-
cant or marginally significant after multivariable adjust-
ment (Table 2), although they were substantially attenu-
ated in magnitude (PVI: HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09-1.52; CVI:
HR,1.26;95%CI,1.04-1.53;NCVI:HR,1.35;95%CI,1.04-
1.75).Inpersonsyoungerthan75years,onlyPVIandNCVI
were statistically associated with mortality, while for those
75 years and older, only PVI was significantly associated
with mortality, after multivariable adjustment.
Structural equation modeling pathway analysis con-
firmedthatvisualimpairmentinfluencedmortalitybyboth
direct and indirect pathways. Table 3 shows the HRs
and 95% CIs using this model. The pattern was similar
to the Cox regression models, except that the HRs were
higher when estimated using SEM.
Of the risk markers investigated by SEM, only disabil-
ity in walking represented a significant indirect pathway
from visual impairment to mortality. Table 4 lists the HRs
and 95% CIs for the indirect effects of disability in walk-
ing on mortality. Figures 1, 2, and 3 illustrate the de-
tailed pathways that could explain the associations found
between visual impairment and mortality. There was a sig-
nificant indirect pathway from visual impairment to mor-
tality via disability in walking, through poorer self-rated
health, to mortality (Table 4) (Figures 1, 2, and 3). An in-
direct pathway through lower BMI bordered on signifi-
cance for NCVI in all age groups (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.99-
1.48;P=.06)butwasnotsignificantforotherformsofvisual
impairment or after age stratification (data not shown).
There was no indirect pathway through any other mortal-
ity risk markers (eg, history of angina, acute myocardial
infarction, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, or smok-
ing). There were also no indirect pathways from visual im-
pairment to mortality through lower home ownership or
education levels. There was no indirect pathway from vi-
sual impairment to mortality through poorer self-rated
health that was independent of disability in walking.
COMMENT
In agreement with previous reports,1-8 we observed that the
presence of visual impairment predicted mortality in older
persons. Using Cox regression models, PVI predicted mor-
tality independent of age, sex, and the presence of known
mortality risk markers. Using SEM analysis, we con-
firmed that visual impairment increased mortality via both
direct and indirect pathways. The relationship between vi-
sual impairment and mortality was strongest for NCVI
among persons with baseline ages younger than 75 years.
Compared with estimates from SEM, Cox regression
appears to underestimate the effect of visual impairment
on mortality by overcorrecting for intermediate variables
that were associated with both visual impairment and mor-
tality. To determine which indirect effects were impor-
tant in predicting mortality for visually impaired per-
sons, we modeled each covariate as a pathway to mortality
(Table 4). Of the mortality risk markers we assessed, only
disabilityinwalkingrepresentedasignificantindirectpath-
way. For this association, 2 possible pathways were iden-
tified; 1 pathway involved only disability in walking, and
the second also involved an effect through low self-rated
health (Table 4) (Figure 1). Because of reduced power
through fewer events, we were unable to differentiate in-
direct effects via age. The age-related trend for mortality,
however, suggests that in persons younger than 75 years

more important than the pathway directly from disability
in walking to mortality (Table 4).
Weaker associations were consistently found in per-

tween visual impairment and mortality after correcting for
covariates in older populations or in analyses that in-
cluded all ages in 1 model.1,10,13 Similar findings are re-
ported for cardiovascular risk factors where risk factors
lose their predictive power after ages of 80 years and
older.1,29-31 One explanation is a ceiling effect, where mor-
tality risk is already high in persons 75 years and older be-
cause of multiple mortality risk factors so that there is a
limit to the additional contribution from visual impair-
ment to mortality. Another explanation is “selective sur-
vival,” that is, persons genetically predisposed to die of
causes related to visual impairment will do so at a rela-
tively younger age, leaving those without this predispo-
sition to survive into very old age.
WefoundthatCVIalsoincreasedmortalityriskviaboth
direct and indirect pathways. Although the direct effect
of CVI on mortality risk seems counterintuitive, the as-
sociation may occur in both directions. The SEM pro-
vides information on the magnitude of the association but
not its direction. There are several mechanisms that could
explain the associations we found between visual impair-
ment and mortality. Persons with various disabilities in
walking may be less likely to see a doctor regularly or to
have prescriptions for critical medications filled. They may
be more socially isolated, have a poorer and relatively un-
varied diet, and less able to seek urgent help when needed.
They may also be less likely to exercise regularly, leading
to lower cardiorespiratory reserve and greater risk of death
during the stress of illness. Disabilities in walking are also
associated with increasing risk of falls and fractures (eg,
hip fractures),32 which may lead to an increased risk of
death.
For the direct pathway, there are probably many un-
identified covariates that were not accounted for. One ex-
ample is poor diet, which is associated with age-related
macular degeneration,33-35 cataract,36,37 cancer,38,39 diabe-

tes,40,41 and cardiovascular disease.38,39,42 We found some
evidence of an indirect association through lower BMI
to mortality for NCVI, which may support this specula-
tion. The direct pathway may also be explained by some
systemic processes that are common to both visual im-
pairment and mortality, such as chronic inflammation.
To our knowledge, only 1 other study has used SEM
to examine the pathways from visual impairment to mor-
tality. In agreement with their findings, our study re-
ported a small but significant indirect effect through dis-
ability.24 In contrast to our results, however, these authors
reported that self-rated health was a significant indirect
pathway that was independent of disability in walking.
Other notable differences from this earlier study were that
the indirect pathways had a lower magnitude than the
direct pathway and the HRs were much lower in com-
parison with those estimated from our study sample. There
were 2 main differences between this earlier study and
ours that may explain this disagreement. First, while the
earlier study was comparable with ours in many ways,
there was no objective measure of VA. Visual function
was assessed by self-reporting and proxy reporting of vi-
sual impairment by asking whether each person was blind
or had difficulty seeing from one or both eyes. This could
have introduced bias because persons with lower self-
rated health and/or disability might have been more likely
to overestimate visual impairment and vice versa. Sec-
ond, the earlier study included persons 18 years and older
in comparison with 49 years and older in our study.
The strengths of our study include its large population-
based data set, with high participation and long fol-
low-up period, standardized VA assessment, use of Aus-
tralian National Death Index mortality and causes of death
data, and detailed data on the health and functional sta-
tus of participants. Limitations include the possibility that
not all potential mortality markers were included in the
model, such as exercise, diet, and nutrition variables. Also,
the relatively low number of persons with visual impair-
ment after age stratification limits our ability to detect
weak associations that could be significant. Limitations
of SEM include the assumption that relationships be-
tween variables in the model are linear and that the di-
rections of the arrows in the path model are assumed but
cannot be proven.
In conclusion, this study reaffirms that visual impair-
ment is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mor-
tality. Analysis using SEM suggests both direct and in-
direct pathways for this relationship. Disability in walking
may represent an important indirect pathway to mortal-
ity for persons with visual impairment, and adjusting for
this factor in statistical analysis may overadjust for the
indirect effect of visual impairment on mortality risk. The
impact of visual impairment on mortality may in fact be
greater than that reported from previous studies that have
used traditional statistical models.
