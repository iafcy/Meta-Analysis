Sensory Impairment, Functional Balance and Physical Activity 
With All-Cause Mortality
Paul D. Loprinzi and Elizabeth Crush
Objective: No study has comprehensively examined the independent and combined effects of sensory impairment, physical 
activity and balance on mortality risk, which was this study’s purpose. Methods: Data from the population-based 2003–2004 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was used, with follow-up through 2011. Physical activity was 
assessed via accelerometry. Balance was assessed via the Romberg test. Peripheral neuropathy was assessed objectively using 
a standard monofilament. Visual impairment was objectively assessed using an autorefractor. Hearing impairment was assessed 
via self-report. A 5-level index variable (higher score is worse) was calculated based on the participant’s degree of sensory 
impairment, dysfunctional balance and physical inactivity. Results: Among the 1658 participants (age 40–85 yrs), 228 died 
during the median follow-up period of 92 months. Hearing (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.18; P = .40), vision (HR = 1.17; P = .58) 
and peripheral neuropathy (HR = 1.06; P = .71) were not independently associated with all-cause mortality, but physical activity 
(HR = 0.97; P = .01) and functional balance (HR = 0.59; P = .03) were. Compared with those with an index score of 0, the HR 
(95% CI) for those with an index score of 1 to 3, respectively, were 1.20 (0.46–3.13), 2.63 (1.08–6.40) and 2.88 (1.36–6.06). 
Conclusions: Physical activity and functional balance are independent contributors to survival.

ments (eg, vision impairment),30 3) increased fall risk,42 4) social 
isolation,43 5) communication difficulties,44 6) increased cardiovas-
cular disease risk,45,46 and 7) impaired psychological functioning.47 
In addition to these potential mechanistic factors, it is possible that 
the association between hearing impairment and premature mortality 
may also be a result of the detrimental effects that hearing function 
may have on physical activity levels.22,48–50 Residual confounding 
may be a possibility in the previous studies14,25–40 examining the 
association between hearing impairment and mortality as few of 
these studies statistically controlled for physical activity, which is 
not surprising as only recently has research demonstrated that hear-
ing impairment is associated with reduced physical activity.22,48–50
In addition to vision and hearing, and although less investigated, 
work also demonstrates an independent contribution of peripheral 
neuropathy on all-cause mortality risk.51,52 Each of these factors 
(vision, hearing and peripheral neuropathy) may influence func-
tional balance,42,53,54 which is important to consider as dysfunctional 
balance is associated with reduced physical activity,55 and reduced 
physical activity is associated with increased mortality risk.56–59
No study, to date, has examined the independent contributions of 
visual impairment, hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, dys-
functional balance and physical inactivity on all-cause mortality risk. 
In addition, no study has examined the potential combined effects of 
these parameters on all-cause mortality risk. As a result, the purpose 
of this study was to examine the potential independent and combined 
effects of each of these 5 parameters on all-cause mortality risk.
Methods
Design and Participants
Data from the 2003–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) were extracted for the current study; only 
available cycle inclusive of all data studied herein. Participants 
Research demonstrates that sensory impairment (eg, vision, 
hearing, and peripheral neuropathy) is associated with increased 
mortality risk. For example, of the 18 studies examining the vision 
impairment-mortality relationship, most,1–15 but not all,16–18 reported 
a statistically significant relationship. However, only 6 studies (with 
4 of them derived from 2 data sets)4,7,9,11,16,17 accounted for physical 
activity when examining the vision impairment-mortality relation-
ship. Importantly, each of these 6 studies used self-report physical 
activity methodology, which is prone to considerable measurement 
error.19 Further, among the 6 studies including self-report physical 
activity as a covariate when examining the vision impairment-mor-
tality relationship, most of these studies used a discrete classification 
of physical activity (eg, walking disability vs. no walking disabil-
ity). Carefully considering physical activity in the vision-mortality 
relationship is important because vision impairment is associated 
with reduced physical activity.20–24 Additionally, among the studies 
examining the relationship between vision impairment and mortal-
ity, the majority of them were conducted in non-U.S. populations, 
including adults from Australia,6,7,9,14 China,1,3,18 Denmark,17 Fin-
land,11 France,12 and India.5 Among the U.S.-based samples, 2 were 
representative samples,8,15 with the others employing convenience 
samples in California,13 Maryland,2 Wisconsin,4,16 or 4 centers across 
the country (Oregon, Minnesota, Maryland, and Pennsylvania).10
In addition to vision, research demonstrates that reduced hear-
ing sensitivity, and in particular, hearing impairment, is predictive 
of premature mortality.14,25–40 Similar to the studies evaluating the 
vision-mortality relationship, the majority of these studies have come 
from non-U.S. populations, utilizing nonrepresentative samples, and 
almost exclusively employed older adult samples. Hypothesized 
mechanisms to explain the hearing-mortality relationship include 1)

from the 2003–2004 NHANES were tracked through December 31, 
2011 for mortality assessment. All study procedures were approved 
by the National Center for Health Statistics Ethics Review Board, 
with consent obtained from all participants before data collection. 
NHANES employs a representative sample of noninstitutionalized 
Americans, using a multistage, complex probability study design. 
Further details of NHANES can be found elsewhere (http://www.
cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). In the current study, 1658 adults (age 
40–85 yrs) provided data for analysis.
Mortality Assessment
The number of individuals deceased during the follow-up period 
(between 2003–2011) was calculated by comparing the participant’s 
personal identification information with the National Center for 
Health Statistics’ National Death Index. Positive matches were then 
examined manually for further validation, whereas individuals who 
had no signs of mortality were considered living at the time of census.
Balance Assessment
Balance assessment of NHANES has been described in previous 
work.55 Briefly, balance testing consisted of using the modified Rom-
berg Test of Standing Balance on firm and compliant support surfaces. 
This test evaluated the participants ability to stand unassisted under 
4 different conditions (ordering in increasing levels of difficulty) 
designed to test sensory inputs from the vestibular system, vision, and 
proprioception: test 1-eyes open, firm surface; test 2-eyes closed, firm 
surface; test 3-eyes open, compliant surface; and test 4-eyes closed, 
compliant surface. Participants were allowed 2 trials for each condi-
tion. For all tests, balance was scored as pass or fail. With tests 1 and 
2 lasting 15 seconds and tests 3 and 4 lasting 30 seconds, test failure 
was defined as the participants needing to open their eyes, moving 
their arms or feet in increase stability, or beginning to fall or requir-
ing assistance to maintain balance. Similar to others,60 participants 
were classified as having dysfunctional balance if they failed any of 
the 4 test conditions. Functional balance, in contrast, was operation-
ally defined as successful completion of all 4 of the test conditions.
Physical Activity Assessment
Assessment of accelerometer-determined physical activity has 
been described in previous NHANES work.23,61,62 Physical activity 
assessed using the ActiGraph 7164 accelerometer. The ActiGraph 
7164 accelerometer is a small activity monitor (size of a wrist watch) 
that was worn on the waist to measure the frequency, intensity and 
duration of physical activity over a 7-day period. SAS (version 9.2) 
was used to reduce accelerometry data to those with ≥ 4 days of 
≥ 10 hr/day of monitored data and integrate it into 1 minute time 
intervals. Nonwear time was identified as ≥ 60 consecutive minutes 
of 0 activity counts, with allowance for 1 to 2 minutes of activity 
counts between 0 and 100. Activity counts/min ≥ 202063 was used 
as the threshold to determine time spent at moderate-to-vigorous 
physical activity (MVPA) across the valid days (ie, days with at 
least 10+ hrs of monitoring). The average MVPA level across these 
valid days was calculated for each participant.
Vision Assessment
Assessment of visual acuity has been described in previous 
NHANES work.22,55,64–66 Briefly, presenting visual acuity was 
assessed for each eye. In eyes with a presenting visual acuity 
of 20/30 or worse, corrected lenses were removed (if worn) and 
objective refraction was measured using an autorefractor (ARK-
760; Marco) in the mobile examination center. Visual acuity of the 
better-seeing eye was used to classify participants given that sight 
in the better eye is the most relevant to disability in numerous visual 
disorders. Participants with presenting better-eye visual acuity of 
20/40 or better were considered to have normal sight. Participants 
with presenting visual acuity worse than 20/40 but postrefraction 
visual acuity in either eye of 20/40 or better were considered to have 
uncorrected refractive error. Participants with visual acuity worse 
than 20/40 after autorefraction or who self-reported not being able 
to see light with both eyes open were considered to have vision 
impairment. Participants with missing data for presenting acuity in 
both eyes or with visual acuity worse than 20/40 in both eyes with 
no autorefraction in either eye were excluded from the analysis 
because they were considered to have incomplete visual acuity 
data. Thus, a 3-level visual acuity variable was created, including 
normal vision, uncorrected refractive error and visual impairment.
Hearing Assessment
For hearing assessment, and as described in previous NHANES 
work,67 participants were asked whether their hearing was good, 
a little trouble, a lot of trouble, or deaf. For these analyses, this 
hearing variable was dichotomized into ‘a lot of trouble or worse’ 
vs. good/little trouble. Although a limitation of this study, we 
chose not to use the objectively-measured audiometry data in our 
analyses because the audiometry assessments were conducted on a 
limited sample of 2003–2004 participants (ie, only one-half sample 
of those between 20 to 69 years). This self-report hearing variable 
has, however, demonstrated some evidence of convergent validity 
by associating with depression symptoms and mobility function.67
Peripheral Neuropathy Assessment
Described in previous NHANES work,68 participants aged 40 years 
and older completed the peripheral neuropathy exam except when 
they refused testing or met 1 of the following exclusion criteria: 
1) bilateral amputation, 2) weight over 400 pounds, 3) presence of 
conditions (eg, casts) that interfered with testing, or 4) inability to 
understand the test instructions. Briefly, participants assumed supine 
position on an exam table while a trained health technician applied 
slight pressure (approximately 10-g filament force) to the bottom 
of each foot while using a standard monofilament (5.07 Semmes-
Weinstein nylon monofilament). In a nonsequential order, pressure 
was applied at 3 sites on each foot: the plantar-first metatarsal head, 
the plantar-fifth metatarsal head, and the plantar hallux. A site was 
considered insensate if the participant incorrectly determined when 
the monofilament was applied to the foot on at least 2 of 3 applica-
tions.69 Participants were defined as having peripheral neuropathy 
if the examination determined at least 1 insensate area in either 
foot69 based on prior work showing that this level of sensory loss 
is predictive of ulcers and amputations, and has demonstrated high 
sensitivity and specificity.70,71
Calculation of Combined Sensory,  
Balance, and Activity Index
A 5-level index variable was calculated based on the participant’s 
degree of sensory impairment, dysfunctional balance and physical 
inactivity. Those with visual impairment were given a score of 1; 
those with a lot or worse hearing trouble were scored as 1; those with 
peripheral neuropathy were scored as 1; those with dysfunctional 
balance were scored as 1; and those below the median level of MVPA

(< 10 min/day) were given a score of 1. Thus, the range for this index 
variable was 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating a worse score.
Covariates
Covariates included were age (continuous; yrs), gender, race-ethnicity 
(Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-His-
panic black, and multiracial), glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) levels 
(continuous; %), measured waist circumference (continuous; cm), 
and medications used to treat dizziness or balance problems (yes/no).
Data Analyses
Analyses were computed using Stata (v. 12) and accounted for the 
complex survey designed employed in NHANES. A multivariable 
Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the independent 
associations of sensory impairment, balance and physical activity 
on all-cause mortality risk.
Results
Among the 1658 participants, 228 died during the median 
follow-up period of 92 months (IQR = 87 to 100 months). In 
the sample, 147,995 person-months occurred with a mortality 
incidence rate of 1.54 deaths per 1000 person-months. Charac-
teristics of the study variables across mortality status is shown 
in Table 1.
Table 2 displays the adjusted Cox proportion hazard results. 
Hearing (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.18; P = .40), vision (HR = 1.17; 
P = .58) and peripheral neuropathy (HR = 1.06; P = .71) were 
not independently associated with all-cause mortality. For every 
1 min/day increase in MVPA, participants had a 3% reduced risk 
of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.97; P = .01). Similarly, after adjust-
ments, those with functional balance (vs. dysfunctional balance) 
had a 41% reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.59; P = 
.03). Figure 1 displays the Kaplan-Meier survival curve across 
balance status.
Another Cox proportional hazard model was evaluated that 
examined the combined effects of sensory impairment, balance and 
activity (ie, the Index variable) on all-cause mortality risk. After 
adjusting for age, gender, race-ethnicity, A1C, waist circumfer-
ence, balance-related medications and difficulty with falls in the 
past year, there was evidence of dose-response relationship for 
this Index variable. Compared with those with an index score of 0, 
the Hazard Ratios (95% CI) for those with an index score of 1 to 
3, respectively, were 1.20 (0.46–3.13), 2.63 (1.08–6.40) and 2.88 
(1.36–6.06). Figure 2 displays the Kaplan-Meier survival curve 
across this Index score.

Discussion
Previous research demonstrates independent contributions of visual 
impairment, hearing impairment and peripheral neuropathy on all-cause 
mortality risk. This, however, was not confirmed in the current study, 
possibly as a result of the limited sample size for these impairments. 
Previous work also demonstrates that sensory impairment is associated 
with reduced physical activity and worse balance, with the current study 
demonstrating that these 2 parameters (physical activity and balance) 
were independently associated with all-cause mortality risk.
The current study also highlights the potential dose-response 
association of sensory impairment, balance and physical activity 
on mortality risk. Promotion of physical activity may be one viable 
health promotion strategy as not only is physical activity indepen-
dently associated with mortality,72 but it is also associated with 
visual acuity,20–24 hearing sensitivity,48–50 peripheral neuropathy68 
and functional balance.55 Functional balance may be particularly 
important to focus on, as dysfunctional balance is associated with 
decreased physical activity,55 which is an important contributor of 
all-cause mortality risk.72 Thus, the present findings, coupled with 
previous work in the literature, suggest that physical activity may 
play an important role in preventing premature mortality, likely 
through a variety of mechanisms, some of which may include 
improving balance and reducing sensory-related impairment. To 
increase physical activity in impaired populations, Rimmer and 
Schiller73 created a model using the main components of access, 
participation, adherence, and health and function. Such a model 
has been shown to help facilitate accessibility and availability of 
physical activity for those with sensory impairments.
Limitations of this study include the relatively short follow-
up period, the subjective assessment of hearing impairment, and 
common in observational studies, assessment of the independent 
variables only at 1 time period (baseline). Strengths of this study 
include the national sample, prospective study design and the objec-
tive assessments of physical activity, balance, peripheral neuropathy 
and visual impairment.
In conclusion, the current study suggests a potential dose-
response association between sensory impairment and all-cause 
mortality risk. In particular, physical activity and functional balance 
were independent contributors to survival. These findings under-
score the importance of promoting safe and progressive forms of 
physical activity. Such activities should aim to facilitate balance, 
and among those with sensory impairment, should be tailored to 
minimize fall risk.
Future confirmatory work on this topic is encouraged, and in 
particular, future work would benefit by examining the prospective 
interrelationships of physical activity, balance and sensory impair-
ment, and collectively how these changes influence mortality risk.
