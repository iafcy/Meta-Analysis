ABSTRACT
Purpose: To examine vision as a predictor of mortality in older people and the role of mobility,
depressed mood, chronic diseases, body mass index, physical activity and injurious accidents
in this possible association. Methods: 223 persons aged 75 and 193 persons aged 80 years at
the baseline participated in visual acuity measurements. Visual acuity (VA) of <0.3 in the better
eye was deﬁned as visual impairment, VA of ≥0.3 but ≤0.5 as lowered vision and VA>0.5 as
normal VA. Death dates were received from the ofﬁcial register. Cox regression models were
used to determine the relative risks of mortality and to study what factors lie on the pathway
from poor vision to mortality. Results: Over the 10-year follow-up, 107 (48%) persons aged 75
years and 138 (72%) aged 80 years at the baseline died. The risk for mortality among the 75-
year-olds with lowered vision was 1.98 (95 % CI 1.25–3.13) and with visual impairment 1.90
(95% CI 1.12–3.20) compared to those with normal VA. Lower walking speed, physical inactivity,
cardiovascular diseases, injurious accidents, diabetes and depressed mood each attenuated the
risk markedly. Nevertheless, lowered vision remained a signiﬁcant predictor of mortality even
after including all these variables in the model. Among the 80-year-olds vision did not correlate
with mortality. Conclusions: Lowered vision and severe visual impairment predicted mortality
in the 75-year-old but not 80-year-old population. The increased risk was partially explained by
lower walking speed, physical inactivity, cardiovascular diseases, depressed mood, diabetes
and injurious accidents.
INTRODUCTION
Several studies have indicated that mortality rates are higher
among older people with lowered visual acuity1−8 as well as
among people with total blindness.9−10 In addition, eye-related
diseases, such as age-related maculopathy, cataract, diabetic
retinopathy and glaucoma correlate with shorter survival.11−17
The mechanisms behind the association between visual im-
pairment and mortality, other than eye-related diseases, have not

been widely studied. However, there is some evidence to sug-
gest that there may be several factors on the pathway explaining
the association. Lee et al. (2003) reported that severe bilateral
visual impairment was associated with increased unintentional
injury mortality in adults aged 18 and over.18 In another study,
after controlling for a broad range of confounders, such as de-
pression, body mass index, reported number of falls and self-
reported physical activity, the association between visual acuity
and mortality was markedly attenuated.19 However, in contrast
to this in older adults between the ages of 65 and 84, depressive
symptoms did not mediate the association between visual acuity
and mortality.2
We hypothesized that factors known to increase mortality
risk, which also often coexist with visual impairment, such
as presence of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, low level
of physical activity, depressive mood and injurious accidents
could underlie the association between poor vision and higher
mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
visual loss is associated with increased all-cause mortality
in a ten-year follow-up and what factors might lie on the
pathway from poor vision to mortality in 75- and 80-year-old
community-dwelling people.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Participants
The data are drawn from the multidisciplinary Evergreen
project, which is a prospective study on health and functional ca-
pacity among older people resident in the city of Jyv¨askyl¨a, Fin-
land. The aim of the Evergreen Study is to describe the health and
functional capacity of the older population, to examine changes
during the follow-up and to identify factors related to conditions
that predict the development of health and functional capacity.
The Evergreen project has been described in detail elsewhere.20
The target group for this study comprised all the community-
dwelling older people aged 75 in 1989 (N = 388, 261 women
and 127 men) and 80 in 1990 (N = 291, 213 women and 78
men) living in Jyv¨askyl¨a, Finland. Altogether 295 (76%) per-
sons aged 75 and 205 (70%) persons aged 80 participated in the
laboratory measurements. Complete data on visual acuity was
available for 223 persons aged 75 and 193 persons aged 80 years
at the baseline. No signiﬁcant differences were found in gender,
baseline walking speed, ability to read a newspaper or mortal-
ity in 10-year follow-up between those with and without visual
acuity measurements at baseline (Table 1). This study adhered
to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Before the baseline
measurements all participants signed an informed consent. The
study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University
of Jyv¨askyl¨a.

ﬁve meters distance. Both eyes were examined separately, ﬁrst
without spectacles and then if the participant had spectacles, the
test was repeated with them on. Landolt ring chart consisted of
13 lines, scored from 0.125 to 2.0. The smallest line seen either
with or without the subjects’ own spectacles was regarded as the
VA of the subject. By modifying the World Health Organization
(WHO) classiﬁcation21 three visual acuity groups were formed:
VA of <0.3 in the better eye was deﬁned as visual impairment
(VI) and VA of ≥0.3 but ≤0.5 in the better eye was deﬁned as
lowered vision (LV). In this study, visual acuity of >0.5 was de-
ﬁned as normal vision (NV). Death dates over the ten years after
baseline measurements were received from the ofﬁcial popula-
tion register of the province of Central Finland. Mortality data
were received for every deceased subject who took part in the
visual acuity measurements at the baseline.
Measures of potential factors on the pathway
from poor vision to mortality
Physiological and psychological factors were selected for the
analyses on the basis of their known or postulated association
with increased risk for mortality. The following factors were
measured at the baseline. Presence of diabetes or cardiovascular
diseases was assessed by a physician on the basis of the sub-
jects’ self-report, current medication and clinical examination.
Participants’ weight and height was measured in the laboratory.
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight (kg)
by height (m) squared. Maximum walking speed was measured
over ten meters in the corridor using a stop watch.22
Self-reported physical activity level was assessed on a six
point scale modiﬁed from Grimby (1986)23: 1) most activities
donesittingdown,2)lightphysicalactivity,3)moderatephysical
activity about 3 hours (h) per week, 4) moderate physical activity
at least 4h per week or heavy physical activity ≤4h a week, 5)
physical exercise at least 3h per week and 6) competitive sports
several times a week. For the statistical analysis, the answers
were re-classiﬁed into 3 categories: 1) only low physical activity
(answers 1 and 2), 2) moderate physical activity (answers 3 and
4) and 3) high physical activity (answers 5 and 6) . Depressive
symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).24 The CES-D scale consists
of 20 items with the total score ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to
60 (maximal number of depressive symptoms). In our analyses,
persons, who scored 16 points or over were classiﬁed as having
depressed mood.24 Information about injurious accidents, which
required medical inspection, was collected for 10 years after the
baseline from the patient records of the local health care centers
and central hospital.
Data analysis
Differences in baseline characteristics and mortality between
persons with and without visual acuity measurements were
tested with cross-tabulation with chi-square tests for categorical
variables and independent samples t-test for continuous variable.
Mortality rates were expressed as number of deaths per 1000
person-years. Follow-up time was calculated from the date of

the baseline measurements to the date of death or to the end of
the follow-up.
Using the Kaplan-Meier procedure with log-rank tests, mor-
tality functions for the three different visual acuity levels were
estimated. Multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox
proportional hazards model. In order to assess differing mortal-
ity risk in the age and vision groups we tested the signiﬁcance of
an interaction term involving vision and age in the Cox model.
Scaled Schoenfeld residuals were used to test proportionality
of hazards using the method developed by Grambsch and Th-
erneau (1994).25 Plots of these residuals against untransformed
time variable and using rank of time were used to gain insight
into potential outlying observations. The outcome was the num-
ber of days from the baseline measurements to the date of death.
The base model was adjusted for gender and socioeconomic
status (net personal income per month).
The analyses was continued in order to ﬁnd factors on the
pathway from poor vision to mortality. Diabetes, cardiovascu-
lar diseases, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, walking
speed, depressed mood and injurious accidents were added to
the base model one at a time. As the event dates for the injurious
accidents were known, they were added into the Cox regression
model as a time-dependent covariate. In constructing the time-
dependent variable, we assumed that the effect of an injurious
accident would last for six months. The participant was counted
in the category of having an injurious accident from the date of
the accident until 180 days later. After six months, unless an-
other accident had occurred, the participant was recategorized
as having no injurious accident until another accident occurred
or until the end of the follow-up.
The relationship between VA and each potential factor on
the pathway was tested with one-way analysis of variance for
continuous variables. For categorical variables cross-tabulation
with chi-square tests was used. The association of each potential
factor on the pathway with mortality was studied with indepen-
dent samples t-test for continuous variables and cross-tabulation
analysis with chi-square tests for categorical variables. When the
variable was signiﬁcantly related to both VA and mortality and
attenuated their association, it was considered to be a factor on
the pathway from poor vision to mortality.
The relative contribution of a potential factor on the pathway
was estimated by ﬁrst computing the hazard ratio (HR) for the vi-
sion terms in the model unadjusted for the factor on the pathway
(Riskbaseline = HR baseline-1), and then by calculating the hazard
ratio for the vision terms in the model adjusted for a factor on
the pathway (Riskadjusted = HR adjusted-1). The relative contri-
bution of the factor was then calculated using the expression:
[(Riskbaseline-Riskadjusted)/Riskbaseline] *100%. Statistical analy-
ses were carried out using SPSS version 13.0 and STATA statis-
tical software.
RESULTS
Out of 223 persons aged 75 years, 47 subjects (21%) had
VI, 75 subjects (34%) had LV and 101 subjects (45%) had
NV. Among the participants aged 80 the corresponding numbers
were 18 (9%), 48 (25%), and 127 (66%). Among the 75-year-
olds, 156 persons (70%) attained the best VA with spectacles,
with the corresponding number 144 (75%) among the partici-
pants aged 80 years.
There were no signiﬁcant differences between men and
women in baseline visual acuity levels. Men and women also
had parallel results in the further analyses and therefore they
were kept together. Although the test of Grambsch and Th-
erneau (1994)25 indicated that in some of the models the effect
of gender was non-proportional at the conventional alpha-level
of 0.05, plots of the residuals against time indicated that treating
gender as time-dependent variable would not lead to substan-
tial changes in the hazard ratios. Because the interaction term
of visual impairment with age was statistically signiﬁcant (p =
0.030), we decided to analyze the 75- and 80-year-old persons
separately.
Over the follow-up 107 (48%) persons aged 75 years and 138
(72%) aged 80 years at the baseline died. The mean length of the
follow-up until death or the end of the surveillance was 3172 (SD
1127) days among the 75-year old persons and 2654 (SD 1248)
days among the 80-year-old participants. The mortality rate per
1000 person-years was 70 among the 75-year-old men and 47

among the 75-year-old women. The mortality rates for the 80-
year-old men and women were 101 and 81, respectively. Among
the 75-year-olds, the follow-up mortality rate per 1000 person-
years was 34 among participants with NV, 70 among participants
with LV and 75 among participants with VI. The corresponding
numbers among the 80-year-olds were 83, 101, and 75.
The log-rank tests showed that in the 75-year-old persons
mortalitydifferedsigniﬁcantlyaccordingtolevelofvisualacuity
(p = 0.002). Participants with normal vision had lower mortality
through the ten-year follow-up than the participants with LV or
VI. Among persons aged 80 mortality did not differ according
to visual acuity (p = 0.433). Figure 1 shows the cumulative
mortality in the different visual acuity groups in both age groups.
In Cox regression model visual acuity did not predict
mortality among 80-year-old persons. However, among the
75-year-old persons in base model (adjusted for gender and
socioeconomic status) both LV and VI increased the risk for
mortality almost twofold in comparison with subjects having
NV. We further investigated the possible effects of body mass
index, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, physical inactivity,
walking speed, depressed mood and injurious accidents,
because of their postulated association with mortality and
visual loss among older people.

The analyses presented in Table 2 showed that in 75-year-
old people presence of cardiovascular diseases, physical in-
activity and lower walking speed correlated with both poorer
vision and increased mortality. In addition, we found that the
prevalence of depressed mood was higher among persons with
LV and VI, compared to those with NV. Among the 80-year-
old persons higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, lower
physical activity and lower walking speed were associated
with mortality. Lower walking speed also correlated with poor
vision.

ity after adjusting for gender and socioeconomic status. Each
factor potentially on the pathway from poor vision to mortality
was added to the base model one at the time. We found that

Lower physical activity explained 24% of the association be-
tween VI and mortality, but it did not attenuate the association
between LV and mortality. Lower walking speed explained 22%

attenuate the association between LV and mortality. Depressed

of association between LV and higher mortality. Injurious acci-
dents explained 9% and diabetes 8% of the association between
VI and mortality, but they did not explain the association be-
tween LV and mortality. Body mass index did not attenuate the
association between vision and poorer survival.
When the variable was signiﬁcantly related to VA and mortal-
ity and attenuated their association in the multivariate model, it
was considered to be a factor on the pathway from poor vision to
mortality. Therefore based on these results, lower walking speed,
physical inactivity and higher prevalence of cardiovascular dis-
eases may be considered as factors on the pathway from poor vi-
sion to mortality among the 75-year-old persons. We also found
that injurious accidents, diabetes and depressed mood each at-
tenuated the increased risk markedly in Cox regression model.
However, in the ﬁnal model, lowered vision remained a signif-
icant predictor of mortality among the 75-year-old participants
even after including all variables in the model.
DISCUSSION
Results of our analyses showed that visual loss predicted mor-
tality among 75-year-old people. In addition, we found several
factors which lie on the pathway connecting poorer vision with
mortality. The association between visual loss and higher mor-
tality has been found in previous studies,1−5,7−8 but our ﬁndings
of the factors on the pathway are new. Further, the interaction
term involving vision and age in the Cox model showed that the
vision related mortality risk differed according to age at base-
line. Among persons aged 80 years at baseline, vision did not
correlate with mortality.
Our ﬁndings suggest that different processes may underlie
the role of vision and deterioration of health at different ages.
There are some earlier studies which are in line with our obser-
vations. In the study by Thiagarajan et al. (2005) participants
with a mean age of 81 years did not have increased risk for
mortality after adjusting the model for a wide range of markers
of frailty.19 Knudsen et al. (2006) also found that visual acuity
of 0.5 or lower decreased survival more in younger age group
(persons aged 43–65) than among persons aged 65–84.26 It has
been suggested that predictors of mortality may change over
time.27 In our study, visual acuity was measured either at the
age of 75 or 80 years. Even though there is overlap in mortal-
ity surveillance for ages 80–85, the situation is not necessarily
comparable as the age of the baseline assessment differed. The
previous studies have found that low vision becomes increas-
ingly common after 80 years of age.28,29 Therefore it is possible
that among those with lowered vision or visual impairment al-
ready at aged 75, underlying serious systemic factors, such as
disease processes, are causing the higher mortality. As shown
in Table 2, among 75-year-old participants cardiovascular dis-
eases were more prevalent among those with lowered vision or
visual impairment. In comparison, among participants aged 80
at baseline, the prevalence of diseases did not correlate with
VA. In our analyses cardiovascular diseases explained almost
the third of the increased mortality risk among participants aged
75. Further, we found that among the 80-year-olds in our study
the mortality rate also among those with normal vision was very
high. As a low vision becomes more common with increasing
age with the decline accelerating around 80, it is possible that
vision correlates with health differently at different ages.
Although an association between visual loss and mortality
has also been found in previous studies, only a few studies have
differentiated between levels of visual loss and their association
with mortality. In most analyses, severe visual impairment (VA
0.3 or lower) has been studied.5,9,14,19 The results obtained by
McCarty et al. (2001) are consistent with our results. They found

that mortality risk was highest among those with visual acuity
between 0.5 and 0.3; however, the participants ranged widely in
age.6
To discover the factors behind the association between lower
vision and mortality, we examined the role of BMI, diabetes,
cardiovascular diseases, walking speed, physical inactivity, de-
pressed mood and injurious accidents because of their known
correlation with poorer vision and survival. We found that lower
walking speed, physical inactivity, and higher prevalence of car-
diovascular diseases explained part of this association among
those with either LV or VI. We also found that injurious ac-
cidents, diabetes and depressed mood each attenuated the in-
creased risk markedly. In previous studies factors explaining the
association between vision and higher mortality have not been
widely studied. Freeman et al. (2005) investigated the mediat-
ing effect of depression behind the association between visual
impairment and mortality, but in their study depression did not
explain the increased risk for death among participants with vi-
sual loss.2Thiagarajan et al. (2005) reported that after adjusting
for depression, body mass index, number of falls and physi-
cal activity, the association between vision and higher mortal-
ity was markedly attenuated. They did not, however, investi-
gate the extend to which each variable separately attenuated this
association.19
In our study, the major part of the association between poor
vision and higher mortality in 75-year-old community-dwelling
persons remained, however, unclear. This indicates that the
relationship between visual loss and mortality could also be
direct. This is suggested by the results obtained by Freeman et
al. (2005), who reported that persons aged 65 and older who
gained in visual acuity (owing to cataract surgery or proper
correction of refractive errors) over a 2-year follow-up period
had a lower risk for death compared to those whose acuity
worsened or did not change.2
Changes of vision could for example be a marker of physio-
logical age. In our analyses, lower walking speed, one marker of
frailty, explained only a minor part of this association. However,
in all likelihood there are also other intervening factors behind
the association between loss of vision and poorer survival than
those studied here. Because we measured visual acuity with the
participants wearing their own spectacles, best corrected VA
could in some cases have been better than the values obtained
in this study. The use of health care services may therefore also
be one factor on the pathway from poor vision to mortality in
our study population. It is possible that persons with inappro-
priate correction of refractive errors do not seek the care they
may need for other health issues either and therefore their risk for
mortality is increased. Lowered vision, due to inappropriate cor-
rection of refractive errors, may lead to several other difﬁculties
in daily activities, which increase the risk for death. A previous
study by Lupsakko et al. (2003) reported that deterioration in
cognitive function was strongly associated with the lack of eye
examination for visual impairment among persons aged 75 and
over.30 Therefore cognitive capacity or dementia could also ex-
plain some of the association between visual loss and mortality.
We do not believe that in our study selective drop-out
would explain the association between loss of vision and higher
mortality. As shown in Table 1, mortality during the ten-year
follow-up did not signiﬁcantly differ between non-participants
compared to participants. Also self-reported inability to read
newspaper in baseline was similar among between the partici-
pants and non-participants. Therefore, our results can be con-
sidered a rather realistic estimate of the effect of visual loss
on mortality in relatively well functioning, urban older people.
However, we can not completely rule out the possibility that
VI and LV correlate with mortality also among the 80-year-
old and older people. Visual acuity is not a static state. Data are
not available about possible cataract surgery or other eye-related
events,whichmayhaveaffectedvisualacuityduringtheten-year
follow-up. In addition, we are not aware of the duration of visual
loss. Although our potential factors on the pathway attenuated
the risk for mortality, it is unclear whether loss of vision pre-
cedes or follows the factors included in the model. The available
data are not sufﬁcient to identify the causal relationships, with
the exception of injurious accidents. For example diabetes and
cardiovascular diseases may have occurred earlier and there-
fore they may be factors leading to visual loss. On the other
hand, visual loss may have preceded physical inactivity and de-
pressed mood and therefore these factors could be mediators be-
tween visual loss and higher mortality. Ideally, potential factors
on the pathway from poor vision to mortality should be mea-
sured as events occurring after incident visual loss. However, the
strengths of this study include relatively large number of partici-
pants, the use of a standardized measure of VA, a long follow-up
period and register-based collection of the mortality data. We
also had detailed data on the health and functional status of the
participants.
In sum, this study showed that a signiﬁcant and independent
relation exists between both lowered vision and visual impair-
ment and mortality in 75-year-old persons in a prospective study
design. Further, higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases,
lower maximum walking speed, self-reported physical inactiv-
ity, depressed mood, diabetes and injurious accidents attenuated
the risks. However, visual acuity is most likely associated with
higher mortality via numerous pathways. Visual loss may be a
marker of other underlying serious systemic factors or the ag-
ing process. Factors on the pathway from poor vision to higher
mortality may also be behavioral or economic, for example in-
adequate use of health care services.
Future studies should focus on the effectiveness of mea-
sures to prevent visual loss and also the effect of proper correc-
tion of refractive errors. Our ﬁndings on depressed mood, car-
diovascular diseases, physical inactivity, lower walking speed,
diabetes and incidence of injurious accidents attenuating the
association between VA and mortality could also provide tar-
gets for interventions. By providing opportunities for phys-
ical exercise and by effectively preventing and treating car-
diovascular diseases, diabetes and depressed mood, increased
mortality rates among older persons with visual loss could be
attenuated.
