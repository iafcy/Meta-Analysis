PURPOSE. Several studies indicate an increased mortality rate in
older adults who have visual impairment, but few have at-
tempted to address a potential causal mechanism. The goals of
this study are to determine whether visual acuity loss increases
the risk of dying and to examine whether depressive symptoms
act as a mediator in this relationship.
METHODS. Data were derived from the 2520 older adults who
participated in the Salisbury Eye Evaluation project, a popula-
tion-based prospective 8-year cohort study. Presenting binoc-
ular visual acuity was measured with the Early Treatment
Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] eye chart and depressive
symptoms with the General Health Questionnaire Part D sub-
scale. Mortality data were collected by staff follow-up. Analyses
were performed with the Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS. Worse baseline acuity was associated with a higher
mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR]  1.05; 95% conﬁdence in-
terval [CI], 1.01–1.09). Also, those who gained two or more
lines of visual acuity over 2 years had a lower adjusted risk of
dying (HR  0.47; 95% CI, 0.23–0.95). An interaction was
detected, in that women who lost 3 lines of visual acuity over
a 2-year period had a higher adjusted risk of dying (HR  3.97;
95% CI, 2.21–7.15), whereas men did not (HR  1.32; 95% CI,
0.66–2.63). Depressive symptoms did not mediate these rela-
tionships.
CONCLUSIONS. If the relationship between visual acuity and mor-
tality is indeed causal, it most likely acts via numerous pathways
through a variety of intervening variables. The identiﬁcation of
these intervening variables could give additional targets for inter-
vention if acuity cannot be restored. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci.

O
lder adults frequently lose visual acuity as they age be-
cause of conditions such as age-related macular degener-
ation, cataract, diabetes, and glaucoma.1,2 Prior population-
based studies have found that visual impairment is associated
with increased risk of subsequent death.3–7 For example, the
Blue Mountains Eye Study found that visual impairment is
independently associated with an increased 5-year mortality
rate, even after adjustment for demographic factors and a
variety of health conditions, including cataract (relative risk
[RR]  1.7; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.2–2.3).7
There are a variety of mechanisms by which visual impair-
ment could be associated with dying. One mechanism is that a
condition such as diabetes may directly cause visual impair-
ment and increase one’s risk of dying. Second, other age-
related conditions (heart disease, for example) may simply
coexist with, but not cause, visual impairment, and these
conditions may increase the risk of dying. Third, visual impair-
ment itself may increase the risk of death by increasing the
likelihood of an accident. Finally, visual impairment may cause
psychological changes that over time increase the risk of death.
If the visual impairment–mortality relationship is indeed
causal, an important goal is to identify any mediators or inter-
vening variables, in the causal pathway, which are amenable to
intervention, particularly since acuity cannot always be re-
stored. It is possible that depression is one such mediator.
Depression may result from vision loss due to feelings of
increased dependence, less social interaction, and increasing
disability. In the literature, depression has been associated with
both visual impairment8–11 and death12–17 and thus is a possi-
ble mediator in this causal pathway.
The goals of this analysis were to examine whether visual
acuity loss increases the 8-year risk of subsequent mortality in
a cohort of older adults and then to test our hypothesis that
incident depressive symptoms may explain part of this rela-
tionship. Loss of acuity over a 2-year period was examined
while adjusting for baseline acuity, because it was expected
that recent changes in vision would be most likely to affect
psychological health.
METHODS
Study Population
In this analysis, we used data from the Salisbury Eye Evaluation, a
population-based cohort study of 2520 older adults between the ages
of 65 and 84 years who were residents of Salisbury, Maryland.18 The
study was consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki and was ap-
proved by the Joint Committee on Clinical Investigation at Johns
Hopkins University. Informed consent was obtained from all partici-
pants. Eligibility criteria included age between 65 and 84 years, resi-
dence near Salisbury and not in a nursing home, ability to communi-
cate, and a score greater than 17 on the Mini Mental State examination.
Of those approached, 65% completed both the home questionnaire
and the medical examination at baseline.
Participants returned for round 2 approximately 2 years later, when
the same questionnaires and clinical procedures were performed. Of
2520 individuals, 2240 (89%) returned for round two. Of the 280 who
did not return, 147 died and 133 withdrew or moved away.
Of the 2240 who returned for round 2, the analysis required that
we exclude those with depressive symptoms at baseline, as deﬁned
later in the article, (n  204) or those without information on depres-
sion at baseline (n  21). Finally, of these 2015 people, there were 17
who did not have depression information at round 2, and an additional
7 who did not have their visual acuity measured at round 2. This gave
a ﬁnal sample size of 1991.

Questionnaire and Clinical Examination
Participants were given an interviewer-administered questionnaire at
home. Demographic, medical history, and behavioral information were
collected. The presence of depressive symptoms was assessed with
Part D of the General Health Questionnaire.19 Questions were asked
about a physician diagnosis of 15 medical conditions.
At the clinical examination, trained observers measured height and
weight using methods described by Caulﬁeld et al.20 Body mass index
was calculated as weight (in kilograms) divided by height (square
meters). Visual function was evaluated during an eye examination
described by West et al.18 Presenting visual acuity was measured
binocularly with the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study
(ETDRS) eye chart under normal illumination. Acuity was then con-
verted to log10 minimum angle of resolution (logMAR).21
Vision and Depression Variables
Presenting visual acuity was used instead of best corrected acuity,
because it is the vision that individuals are able to use in the real world.
It is this type of vision, as opposed to the best hypothetical vision one
could have, that was hypothesized to affect eventual mortality through
its action on depressive symptoms.
A change in visual acuity was deﬁned as the difference between the
two presenting visual acuity logMAR scores in the second and ﬁrst
rounds. For ease of interpretation, it was decided a priori that a
four-category variable would be created. Those who lost between 2
and 3 lines of visual acuity had “mild loss,” those who lost 3 lines of
visual acuity had “moderate loss,” and those who gained 2 lines of
visual acuity had “vision gain.” The reference group included those
who had not gained or lost 2 lines of acuity.
Baseline visual acuity was examined categorically as well, but was
then used as a continuous variable, since it appeared to have a linear
relationship with mortality. The  coefﬁcient for baseline visual acuity
was multiplied by 0.1 to give more meaningful units. Therefore, the 
coefﬁcient for baseline acuity equaled the log odds ratio for a 1-line
increase (worsening) in acuity score rather than a 1-letter increase.
Incident depressive symptoms were deﬁned if a person answered
afﬁrmatively to one or more of the seven questions of the General
Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) Part D at round 2 but not at round 1.
These questions ask about feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and
suicidal thoughts.19
Mortality Follow-up
All participants enrolled at baseline were called yearly by telephone for
follow-up. Information on mortality was obtained by report from family
members, by the local newspapers, and by staff follow-up. All deaths
reported by July 2003 were used in the current analysis. If the year of
death was known, but the day and/or month were missing, then the
midpoint was assigned. There were 56 people who had died but for
whom we were unable to obtain a year of death.
Statistical Analysis
First, the characteristics of those in the four visual acuity change
categories were compared. Next, the proportions of individuals who
died in each of the visual acuity change groups were calculated and
tested using the Pearson 2 test. Then, Cox regression models were
used to estimate the hazard of death for the various visual acuity
change groups, adjusting for age, sex, race (white, African-American),
education (12 years or 12 years), number of comorbidities (0–3 or
4 comorbidities), body mass index (25, 25–30, 30–35, or 35
kg/m2), smoking (never, past, current), history of diabetes, stroke, or
hypertension (yes/no), and baseline visual acuity. Variables that were
not statistically signiﬁcant were removed one at a time, and their effect
on visual acuity change was noted. If, after removal, there was little
change in the hazard ratios for visual acuity change, then these vari-
ables were excluded from the ﬁnal model.
Those 56 individuals who had died but for whom the date of death
was unknown were at ﬁrst excluded from the analyses. Then, sensi-
tivity analyses were performed including them and assuming their date
of death to be the midpoint of the time between their last round
attended and the end of the study.
The proportionality assumption was checked by examining scaled
Schoenfeld residual plots versus time for each variable, to determine
whether the slope deviated systematically from zero, and also by
examining log–log survival curves versus log(time) and adjusting for
the mean values of the other variables to see whether the curves were
roughly parallel. The correlation of the covariates was checked to
assess colinearity. Ties in hazard times were handled by the Breslow
method. Effect modiﬁers including visual impairment (worse than
20/40) at baseline, diabetes, and gender were evaluated by stratiﬁca-
tion and by including interaction terms with visual acuity change into
the regression model.
To determine whether incident depressive symptoms were a me-
diator in the relationship between visual acuity loss and time to death,
the methods of Baron and Kenney22 were used. Brieﬂy, the relation-
ship between visual acuity loss and mortality should be reduced once
depressive symptoms are in the model, if depressive symptoms act as
a mediator.
RESULTS
The baseline characteristics of individuals by change in visual
acuity category are compared in Table 1. The groups were
similar except that those who gained visual acuity were more
likely to be women and African-American and to have had
worse baseline visual acuity than the other groups. Those who
had moderate visual acuity loss were much more likely to have
reported diabetes than were the other groups.
In the 1991 participants used in the analysis, there were 481
(24%) deaths as of July 2003. Those who died were more likely
to be older men, African-American, and less educated and to
have had worse baseline visual acuity, to have had conditions
such as diabetes, stroke, hypertension, and to be current smok-
ers (P  0.05 from t-test or Pearson 2 test; data not shown).
Compared to the 24% of those who died in the group who
did not change acuity, a greater percentage of those with
moderate acuity loss died (47.1%), whereas a smaller percent-
age of those who gained acuity died (14.5%; Pearson 2 test,
P  0.00; Table 2).
After adjusting for age, sex, race, diabetes history, body
mass index, comorbidity number, and smoking history, we
found that moderate 2-year acuity loss, gain in acuity, and
baseline visual acuity were associated with death (Table 3).
Those who had a moderate 2-year loss in acuity had an in-
creased hazard of dying (HR  2.23; 95% CI, 1.43–3.46),
whereas a gain in acuity was associated with a decreased
hazard (HR  0.47; 95% CI, 0.23–0.96; Table 3, model 1). Also,
those with worse baseline visual acuity had an increased risk of
death, so that there was a 5% increased risk of death per 1-line
loss of acuity (HR  1.05; 95% CI 1.01–1.10; Table 3, model 1).
In model 2, incident depressive symptoms at round 2 were
included in the model, to determine whether it would explain
the relationship between acuity loss and subsequent death.
The HRs for moderate acuity loss in models 1 and 2 are nearly
identical, suggesting that depressive symptoms do not mediate
this relationship. In fact, incident depressive symptoms, as
measured by the General Health Questionnaire Part D, were
not strongly associated with the hazard of death (HR  1.23;
95% CI, 0.89–1.74). Education, history of hypertension, and
history of stroke at baseline were not included in the ﬁnal
models due to both their lack of statistical signiﬁcance and
their lack of an effect on visual acuity change after their
removal.

The adjusted survival curves derived from the Cox regres-
sion model are shown in Figure 1. The ﬁgure shows that those
who gained visual acuity had the longest time until death,
whereas those who had a moderate visual acuity loss had the
shortest time to death.
An interesting interaction was found between gender and
moderate vision loss (Table 4). The men who had moderate
acuity loss did not have a signiﬁcantly higher hazard of mor-
tality (HR  1.32; 95% CI, 0.66–2.63), whereas the women did
(HR  3.97; 95% CI, 2.21–7.15). The P-value from a model with
an interaction term for moderate acuity loss and gender was
statistically signiﬁcant (P  0.01). Other interactions with
diabetes and baseline acuity were not found.
The characteristics of those who died before round 2 were
compared with the characteristics of those who were still
living (data not shown). As expected, those who died were
older and more likely to be men than those who were still
living. In addition, after age and sex adjustment, those who
died were more likely to be nonwhite, to have a higher mean
number of comorbidities, to have diabetes and a history of
stroke, and to be current smokers (data not shown).
Analyses were rerun including the 56 individuals who had
died but had no death date and using the midpoint of the
follow-up time between their last round attended and the end
of the study as their date of death. The inferences remained the
same (data not shown). In addition, the mean visual acuity was
no different between those with a known date of death and
those with an unknown date of death (logMAR 0.04 vs. logMAR
0.07; ANOVA P  0.29), and there were no meaningful differ-
ences in the percentages of those with 2-year visual acuity
change between those with a known date of death and those
with an unknown date of death (Pearson 2 test, P  0.71).
The proportionality assumption was checked for all vari-
ables and was appropriate.
DISCUSSION
We have conﬁrmed that worse baseline visual acuity is associ-
ated with the risk of mortality and have also found that the
women who had a moderate loss of acuity over a 2-year period
had a higher risk of mortality whereas the men with a moderate
loss did not. In addition, we report that those who gained 2
lines of visual acuity had a lower risk of dying than those whose
acuity did not change. We did not ﬁnd that incident depressive
symptoms at round 2 explained any of the observed relation-
ship between acuity loss and mortality.
The ﬁnding that a 2-year gain in visual acuity was associated
with a decreased risk of death is novel, to our knowledge.
Almost half (47%) of those who had a 2-year gain in visual
acuity had cataract surgery during that time. The other 53%

who gained visual acuity presumably had their refractive errors
corrected in the interim period. Although we are limited by the
small sample, it appears that the reduced risk of death was
mostly in the group who had their refractive errors corrected
(7% died vs. 24% in the reference group) as opposed to those
who had cataract surgery (19% died). Nevertheless, if the
association between a gain in acuity and a reduced risk of
mortality is causal, one explanation may be that having taken
action to reverse visual acuity loss resulted in increased feel-
ings of self-efﬁcacy23 that may have encouraged other actions
to improve health. Unfortunately, we do not have the data to
address this question, but perhaps future studies could resolve
it. The association could also be due to residual confounding,
in that it could be that persons who had a 2-year gain in acuity
differ in other factors that explain the decreased risk of mor-
tality. For example, it could be that those with a gain in acuity
had a higher socioeconomic status (SES) than those who did
not have a visual acuity change, and SES has been associated
with mortality.24 Although we do not have data on SES, there
are no differences in education, which is sometimes used as a
surrogate for SES, between those who had a moderate acuity
loss and those who had a 2-year gain in acuity. It could also be
that those who gained in visual acuity were healthier than
those who had no change, although there were no meaningful
differences in the number of comorbidities between the
groups with change in visual acuity, and those who gained
acuity were more likely to be currently smoking, which is not
consistent with their being healthier.
We chose to use presenting visual acuity because we hy-
pothesized that a person’s actual acuity (as opposed to best
possible acuity) would affect psychological health. However,
our results were very similar when we used best corrected
visual acuity, although gain in acuity was not statistically sig-
niﬁcantly related to mortality, because of the smaller number
of people who had a gain in best corrected acuity (n  36).
The association between loss in visual acuity and an in-
creased risk of death is consistent with other ﬁndings in studies
that looked at visual impairment and death.3–7 To our knowl-
edge, this is the ﬁrst study in which recent visual acuity change
was examined (as opposed to just visual impairment of un-
known duration) and mortality. Our ﬁnding that a 2-year gain in
acuity is associated with a decreased risk of death is not

consistent with previous ﬁndings that those with cataract sur-
gery (most of whom would presumably gain acuity) had an
increased risk of death.25–27 It is difﬁcult to compare these
ﬁndings directly with the results of our analysis because our
analysis examined gain in acuity, whereas the others examined
cataract surgery without regard to change in acuity.
Our results also corroborate a previous study that found a
relationship between visual impairment and mortality only in
women.3 We did not ﬁnd an interaction between baseline
acuity and gender, but we did ﬁnd an interaction between
moderate acuity loss and gender. These ﬁndings suggest that
women may be more vulnerable to a rapid loss of vision in
older age than are men. The reasons for this are not known.
There may be interactions between moderate acuity loss and
gender for outcomes like falling, car accidents, medication
errors, or decreased social support that then have an impact on
mortality risk. Because studying interactions requires much
larger sample sizes, a large, longitudinal study with detailed
cause of death information would be needed to evaluate this
more thoroughly.
To attempt to delineate a causal pathway, we explored
whether depressive symptoms explain the relationship be-
tween visual acuity and mortality. We found no evidence of
that they do. It is likely that we underestimated those with
depressive symptoms, by using the GHQ-28. Reporting infor-
mation on feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness is a
sensitive topic, and some individuals may not have felt com-
fortable revealing that information in person, especially in this
age group. This underestimation of depressive symptoms may
have biased any association between depressive symptoms and
mortality toward the null, because it is unlikely that the under-
reporting would have differed by subsequent mortality status.
In addition, the correlation between a clinical diagnosis of
depression and depressive symptoms on the GHQ-28 Part D
subscale is 0.56,19 which could have further biased our results
toward the null. Despite the imperfect nature of our depres-
sion variable, we still think it was important to examine
whether it explained any of the observed relationship between
visual acuity and mortality and to report that it did not.
Because 2-year visual acuity loss and incident depressive
symptoms were both measured at round 2, reverse causality
could be a concern. For example, depression may have caused
individuals to lose vision because they did not receive care
(untreated cataract, refractive error). However, depression at
round 1 was not associated with incident visual impairment at
round 2, suggesting that this is not a major concern.
Some individuals died before round 2, precluding us from
measuring the change in their visual acuity. If these people
were less likely to have had moderate acuity loss before they
died, then our reported association between moderate acuity
loss and mortality might be upwardly biased. However, be-
cause those who died before round 2 were older and had more
diabetes and because these are risk factors for moderate visual
acuity loss, they probably would have been more likely to have
had moderate visual acuity loss, which would have strength-
ened our results. In addition, a sensitivity analysis assuming
that all those who died before round 2 did not have moderate
acuity loss supported our results (data not shown). Similarly, if
those who died before round 2 were more likely to have had a
gain in visual acuity before they died, then our reported asso-
ciation between gain in visual acuity and decreased mortality
might be exaggerated. However, it is probably less likely that
these individuals would have undergone cataract surgery or
correction of refraction to achieve a gain in acuity if they were
undergoing the health problems that often occur before death.
There are now several studies that indicate an increased risk
of mortality in people with impaired visual acuity, two of
which have found this to be true mainly in women. If the
relationship between acuity and mortality is indeed causal, it
most likely acts via numerous pathways through a variety of
intervening variables. Future work using large datasets should
investigate how vision loss is associated with different causes
of death, should examine whether factors such as a clinical
diagnosis of depression, falls, or other accidents act as inter-
vening variables in this relationship, and should examine why
this relationship may be limited to women. The identiﬁcation
of these factors could give additional targets for intervention if
acuity cannot be restored.
