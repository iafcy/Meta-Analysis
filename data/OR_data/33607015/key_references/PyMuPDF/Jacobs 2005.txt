ABSTRACT. Background and aims: Our aim was
to determine the impact of visual impairment on self-
rated health, function and mortality amongst a com-
munity-dwelling elderly cohort. Methods: The study
design was prospective and longitudinal, subjects
being taken from an age-homogeneous, community-
dwelling cohort comprising 452 subjects aged 70
in 1990 and 839 subjects aged 77 in 1998. Com-
prehensive data were collected by structured inter-
views and medical examinations carried out during
home visits. Data included each subject’s demo-
graphic and socio-economic profile, medical history,
physical findings, functional status and self-rated
health status.Visual acuity was measured using a
Snellen chart and visual impairment was defined
as best-eye corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or worse
on Snellen chart testing. Results: Measured and
self-reported visual impairment correlated closely,
and were significantly more prevalent amongst sub-
jects with low education and poor financial status. Vi-
sually impaired subjects showed significantly greater
dependence in ADL and IADL, poor self-rated
health, less ability to rely on friends, increased lone-
liness and, in men aged 77, increased visits to the
emergency room and hospital admissions. Visual
impairment at age 70 significantly predicted poor
self-rated health (p=0.029, OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.09-
5.10), dependence in ADL (p=0.007, OR 2.91, 95%
CI 1.34-6.33), general tiredness (p=0.037, OR 2.40,
95% CI 1.06-5.44), and mortality, with a two-and-a-
half-fold increase in risk of death at seven years
(p=0.0017,OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.48-5.46). Conclu-
sions: Visual impairment in the elderly increases the
risk of social, functional and medical decline.

INTRODUCTION
Visual impairment has long been recognized as an
important factor in the aging process, and there is grow-
ing awareness of its significant influence on health and
functional status. More recent findings indicate that visual
impairment in the elderly has prognostic value as an in-
dependent predictor of mortality (1-4). Other studies
have found evidence that visual impairment increases
the risk of falls (5, 6), fractures (7, 8), use of community
services (9), institutionalization (10, 11), and a decline in
the ability to perform basic and instrumental activities of
daily living (12, 13), as well as significant affective (14, 15)
and cognitive morbidity (16). The vast majority of research
has been based upon cross-sectional studies with study
populations covering a wide range of different age groups,
sampled from clinic- or hospital-based populations. Very
few studies have analyzed the impact of diminished vision
in the context of comprehensive assessment (4, 13),
thus adjusting for the numerous comorbid factors present
in an aging population. In the only previous investigation
that did follow subjects longitudinally (4), the population
studied was heterogeneous in age, ranging from 55 to 74
years old at baseline.
The objective of our study was to determine the impact
of visual impairment on self-rated health, function and
mortality among community-dwelling elderly. Its unique-
ness is that, in addition to being longitudinal in design, the
data collected on vision form part of a comprehensive
geriatric assessment and the study population is an age-
homogeneous cohort of 70-year olds, representative of
the entire age stratum in Jerusalem. 
METHODS
The methodology of the Jerusalem Longitudinal Study
has been described in detail (17, 18). The study was initi-
ated in 1990 and has followed a cohort of West Jerusalem
Aging Clinical and Experimental Research

residents born between June 1920 and May 1921. Sub-
jects were identified using the Interior Ministry Register for
national elections. At each phase of data collection, subjects
were interviewed and examined, providing information
from sociodemographic, medical, functional and cultural
domains. The Helsinki Committee approved the study
design. The first phase of data collection took place in
1990 and the second in 1998. The only difference in da-
ta collection at the second phase was that both inter-
views and examinations were carried out in the subject’s
home, whereas previously the examinations had been
performed in a hospital ambulatory care setting. 
The subjects of the 1990 sample group have been
proved to be representative of the total age stratum of the
Jerusalem population, as shown by identical three-year
mortality and disease specific hospital morbidity (18).
Showing that the sample group was representative of
the total age stratum, enabled the enrolment of addition-
al subjects into the cohort at the second stage of data col-
lection, at age 78. Of the 452 subjects examined at age
70, 70 (15.5%) had died at the time of follow-up, 78
(17.3%) refused to participate, 21 (4.7%) had left
Jerusalem, and a further 22 (4.9%) could not be traced.
Thus, from the 382 surviving subjects, a total of 261
(68.3%) subjects were examined twice, forming the lon-
gitudinal group in the study, and 121 (31.7%) subjects were
lost to follow-up. In order to maintain sample size and to
ensure the subsequent phases of longitudinal data col-
lection, a further 578 new subjects of the same age cohort
were enrolled at the second stage of data collection.
Data are presented here from three groups: 1) Cross-
sectional analysis of 452 subjects aged 70 in 1990; 2)
Cross-sectional analysis of 839 subjects aged 77 in 1998;
and 3) Longitudinal findings from 261 subjects examined
in 1990 and 1998.
Analysis
Data storage and analysis were performed using the
SAS package. Cohorts were examined both cross-sec-
tionally and longitudinally. Cross-sectional analysis of
each cohort at age 70 (452 subjects) and 77 ( 839 sub-
jects) was performed using Chi-square analysis of variables.
Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed on the
261 subjects for whom data was available from both
phases of the study, to identify the impact of visual im-
pairment over seven years. Odds ratio and confidence in-
tervals were determined. The Log rank test was per-
formed to determine seven-year mortality.
MEASURES
Visual impairment
Subjects were asked if they had difficulty in seeing
according to the following question: “Do any problems
with vision restrict or interfere with your personal or so-
cial life?” and examined by a specially trained nurse who
tested visual acuity in Snellen equivalent values. Subjects
who normally wore glasses were tested with corrected vi-
sion. Measured visual impairment was defined as best cor-
rected visual acuity in the best eye of 20/40 or worse.
This cut-off is widely recognized in research concerning
function and mortality (2, 4, 8, 19, 20) and conforms to
the definition of mild visual impairment of the American
Academy of Ophthalmology (21). Several states within the
USA also use this cut-off for issuing unrestricted drivers’
licenses.
Comprehensive assessment
At each phase of data collection, subjects were sys-
tematically asked about their medical history, including a
battery of questions concerning social, demographic,
cultural and psychological factors, health habits, Emer-

gency Room utilization, hospitalizations, falls in the pre-
ceding year, fractures in the prior seven years, and phys-
ical activity (as defined as going for a walk at least 4
times a week). Self-rated health was measured in both ab-
solute terms and in relation to others of the same age. 
Four Activities of Daily Living (ADL), transfer, dress,
bathing and hygiene in the toilet, were taken from the
Katz scale, whereas the Instrumental Activities of Daily Liv-
ing (IADL) were cleaning the home, laundry, cooking,
shopping and telephone use (22). Independence for each
function was determined by direct observation. Com-
prehensive physical examination was performed including
vital signs, neurologic examination, and cognitive and af-
fective assessement. Dependence in ADL was defined as
requiring assistance from another person in any activity
tested; dependence in IADL was defined as requiring
assistance from another person in more than one of the
activities tested. Depression was identified by the Brief
Symptoms Inventory (23).
Mortality data were obtained from a comprehensive re-
view of all death certificates issued in Israel through the
Ministry of the Interior, and are complete for all subjects
remaining in Israel.
RESULTS
The basic demographic and social characteristics of the
cohorts at ages 70 and 77 according to visual impairment
are listed in Table 1. Visual impairment was significantly
associated with low educational and financial status, at
both ages 70 and 77. Amongst men aged 70, the asso-
ciation with financial status failed to achieve significance.
Visually impaired subjects reported significantly diminished
ability to rely on friends.
There was a close correspondence between mea-
sured visual impairment and the complaint that visual
problems disturbed daily life. In subjects with measured
impairment, 61% at age 70 (p=0.004) and 75% at
age 77 (p=0.001) reported difficulty because of visual
problems. In accordance with accepted norms in current
research (24), measured visual impairment alone was
used for data analysis.
The overall prevalence of measured visual impair-
ment at ages 70 and 77 was 23.2% and 16.6% respec-
tively. Of the visually impaired, those with measured im-
pairment between 20/40 up to and including 20/70
formed the majority (76 and 72% at ages 70 and 77 re-
spectively).
The association of decreased visual acuity with other
health variables at ages 70 and 77 is listed in Tables 2 and
3 respectively. Visual impairment was significantly asso-
ciated with poor absolute and relative self-rated health, and
dependence in ADL and IADL. Visually impaired subjects
reported more fatigue, a finding which achieved statistical
significance in women aged 70. 
Visually impaired women aged 70 and men aged 77
felt significantly more lonely. Health service use revealed
that, of the 77-year-old men, visually impaired subjects had
significantly more emergency room visits and hospital ad-
missions. Falls were significantly increased amongst visually
impaired 77-year olds. Although declining function was
found with increased age across most domains, depen-
dence still remained significantly greater in visually im-
paired subjects. 
Diabetes was significantly associated with impaired
vision (with the exception of 70-year-old women), as
was hypertension in 77-year old women.

Longitudinal findings
In order to examine the influence of impaired vision at
age 70 on a number of health-related outcomes at age
77, data from subjects examined at both ages 70 and 77
were analyzed by multiple logistic regression. The de-
pendent variables examined at age 77 were self-rated
health relative to others, general tiredness, independence
in ADL, level of physical activities, falls, fractures, emer-
gency room visits, hospital admissions, loneliness, and de-
pression. The independent variables at age 70 included in
the regression model were visual impairment, self-rated
health relative to others, general tiredness, independence
in ADL, level of physical activity, falls, loneliness, de-
pression, hearing ability, financial difficulties, and gender.
The self-reported diagnoses of diabetes, hypertension
and heart disease at age 70 were also included as con-
founding, comorbid variables. For each dependent variable
measured in 1998, the same variable in 1990 was also in-
cluded as an independent variable in the regression mod-
el, to compensate for the influence of baseline deficiencies
at age 70 by the factor being analysed. The results, listed
in Table 4, show that impaired vision at age 70 con-
tributes significantly and independently to poor self-rated
health relative to others (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.09-5.10),
general tiredness (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.06-5.44) and de-
pendence in ADL (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.34-6.33).
Mortality
Amongst subjects without measured visual impair-
ment, 7-year mortality was 12.5%, whereas visually im-
paired subjects had a mortality rate of 26.7% (p=0.0007)
(data not shown). A multiple logistic regression model was
used to determine the influence of visual impairment at
age 70 on 7-year mortality. Independent variables were vi-
sual impairment at age 70, self-rated health relative to oth-
ers, independence in ADL, hypertension, diabetes, is-
chemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, anemia, res-
piratory disease, malignancy, kidney disease, cigarette
smoking, financial difficulties, and gender. Visual im-
pairment at age 70 was found to be a highly significant

DISCUSSION
This study clearly shows the widespread impact of vi-
sual impairment amongst a population-based cohort of
70-year olds over a follow-up period of 7 years. The
comprehensive nature of the data permitted analysis of nu-
merous variables, including a large number of confound-
ing comorbid factors.
Despite the well-established fact that low self-rated
health is an independent predictor of mortality (25, 26),
extremely few studies have investigated its relationship to
visual impairment. A recent study which addressed this is-
sue (27) was based on an age-heterogeneous group and
lacked longitudinal evaluation. Multivariate analysis failed
directly to include ADL, a factor known to contribute sig-
nificantly to self-rated health. Visual impairment was
found to be significantly associated with poor self-rated
health only in younger subjects. Our study found two
separate measures of self-rated health to be highly asso-
ciated with visual impairment at ages 70 and 77, and vi-
sual impairment at age 70 turned out to be a significant
prognostic factor for poor self-rated health at age 77. Our
data showed that visual impairment continues to erode
self-rated health with advancing age, a finding to be ex-
tended at the next phase of data collection.
Although the prevalence of measured visual impairment
decreased slightly with advancing age, there was an in-
crease in the proportion of self-rated visual impairment in
those with measured visual impairment. The findings
are complementary, since greater mortality amongst vi-
sually impaired subjects explains the reduced survival
and lower prevalence over time, whereas the increase in
self-rated visual impairment supports the fact that the im-
pairment does become a greater burden and a more
meaningful barrier with increasing age. 
With respect to functional status, the results of our
study strengthen the growing consensus that visual im-
pairment substantially affects the level of function, whether
measured by ADL, IADL, or the need for community sup-
port services (4, 9, 13, 27, 28). In our population, visu-
al impairment was significantly associated with function-
al decline in both ADL and IADL in both age groups.
More importantly, this study confirms the long-term pre-
dictive value of visual impairment in identifying subjects at
risk for subsequent functional decline. 
Previous studies found a small to moderate impact of
visual impairment on mortality (4, 29), and our results,
which incorporated numerous comorbid factors, con-
firmed and strengthened these findings. Mild visual im-
pairment at age 70 was associated with significantly in-
creased mortality at age 77, carrying a two-and-a-half-
fold greater risk of death.
The mechanisms of increased mortality in visually im-
paired people are probably both indirect and multi-
factorial. Perhaps less effective access to health services
is partly due to a decreased social network and support
(9), a six-fold lower likelihood of leaving their homes (1),
increased falls and mishaps (5-8), functional decline
(12, 13) and diminished psychological wellbeing (14-
16), which all seem to be plausible factors contributing
to a spiral of increasing frailty and vulnerability, them-
selves the harbingers of illness and death.
There are several limitations to this study. The known
inaccuracy of death certificates, exacerbated by the ex-
tremely low number of autopsies performed in Israel,
precluded reliable ascertainment of the cause of death,
thus denying a more detailed insight into specific mech-
anisms of mortality.
Similarly, the individual causes of visual impairment
were not evaluated, as self-reported data in this area are
imprecise. The definition of visual impairment based up-
on Snellen chart acuity has traditionally been an ac-
cepted standard, although some recent reports have fa-
vored more comprehensive tests, such as the visual-
function index (30) and activities of daily vision (31).
These newer tools are themselves being assessed for va-
lidity. It should be emphasized that they attempt to
refine rather than replace Snellen acuity, still the cor-
nerstone in assessing visual function.
With regard to the loss to follow-up of subjects from
longitudinal analysis, 121 (31.7%) of surviving subjects
were lost to follow-up. Comparison of baseline charac-
teristics revealed that those subjects who were followed up
were more highly educated and had fewer financial diffi-
culties – a finding common to longitudinal studies. More
importantly, however, there was little difference between
the groups in terms of visual impairment at baseline – vi-
sually impaired subjects formed 19 and 24% of those fol-
lowed up and those lost to follow-up respectively. 
Taken together, these results show the far-reaching
negative consequences of even mild visual impairment in the
elderly population, be it on self-related health, functional sta-
tus or mortality. Far greater awareness of the significance
of visual impairment in geriatric care and improved outreach
services are necessary, aimed at improved detection, di-
agnosis and correction of visual problems.
