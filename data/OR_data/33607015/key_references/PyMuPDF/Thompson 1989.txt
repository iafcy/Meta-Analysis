Visual Impairment and Mortality
in Elderly People
J. R. THOMPSON, J. M. GIBSON, C. JAGGER
Summary
By linking together the results from two surveys of elderly people in an English community it has been
possible to consider visual impairment as a possible risk factor for mortality in people aged 75 years and
over. Although minor degrees of visual impairment are associated with an increased mortality rate, blind
people survive better than those with less serious visual impairments. Associations are considered
between visual impairment and other known risk factors for mortality in the elderly. Visual impairment is
shown to be associated with degree of social contact, whether a person lives alone, dementia score,
physical activity score and number of unmet needs.
Introduction
The factors associated with survival in the
elderly are not necessarily the same as those that
are associated with the survival of the popula-
tion as a whole. Studies of mortality in the
elderly [1-7] have identified numerous risk
factors, most of which are highly interdepen-
dent. These identified risk factors appear to be
associated with mortality by a combination of
four routes; either they measure intrinsic ageing
processes, are related to particular physical
diseases or psychological states, or they are
related to social factors such as isolation and
difficulties with self-care. Whatever the mecha-
nism by which they reflect a person's survival
chances, easily measured risk factors should
play an important role in the screening of the
elderly and the planning of services for preven-
tive care.
Using the results from an approximately 5-
year follow-up of a study of vision and eye
disease amongst the elderly in an English
community, the plausible use of vision as a
predictor of survival is investigated. Associ-
ations between visual impairment and other
acknowledged risk factors for survival in the
elderlv are then considered.
Methods
A regularly updated age-sex register is in operation
in Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire. The task of
ensuring the completeness of the register has been
simplified greatly by the fact that the whole town is
served by a single 12-doctor general practice. The
register contains some 32 000 names and has proved a
useful sampling frame for a number of surveys.
In 1981 a study was undertaken of all those people
who were aged 75 years or over on 31 December 1980
[8]. The survey looked at such factors as general
health, social isolation and the provision of services.
Subsequently, the same sample formed the basis of a
second survey, this time of eye disease in the elderly
[9]. This second survey involved detailed eye exam-
inations of a random sample of 469 of those in the
original list who survived into 1982.
By combining the information from these two
surveys and from a subsequent 5-year follow-up, a
database has been formed containing information on
general health, social factors, eye disease and sur-
vival. This information has been used to investigate
the association between visual impairment and sur-

vival in the elderly by using a regression analysis
based on the Cox model [10].
For the purposes of this study, vision was denned
as the corrected visual acuity of the subject's better
eye. The visual acuities were measured using Snellen
charts at 6 m and then grouped into five categories:
(1) 6/6 or better,
(2) 6/7.5 to 6/9,
(3) 6/12 to 6/18,
(4) 6/24 to 6/60,
(5) worse than 6/60.
It is not possible to make an exact correspondence
between these categories and the registration of the
blind, because the blind register takes account of
both visual acuity and reductions in visual fields.
However, all people in category 5 would be eligible
for blind registration, and inclusion in category 4
approximates to eligibility for partial-sight regist-
ration.
Measurements of a number of previously acknow-
ledged risk factors for mortality [11] were taken from
the original survey and compared with the grouped
visual acuities. These risk factors were: living alone,
an incontinence scale, a physical-activity scale,
dementia, and unmet need. We also considered the
protective effect of good social contact. Social contact
was measured on a scale suggested by Tunstall [12]
with a high level of social contact being defined as
a score of 40 contacts per week or more. The
physical-activity scale was constructed from mobi-
lity about the home, getting to and from the toilet,
getting out of a chair, getting in and out of bed, and
dressing. The derivation of the scales for physical
activity and incontinence have been described else-
where [13]. Dementia was measured by the Informa-
tion sub-test of recognition devised by Pattie and
Gilleard [14]. Unmet need was measured by assess-
ing whether the elderly person needed extra help in
any of 19 areas. These areas included help with
housework, help with dressing and chiropody. The
recorded score was the total number of unmet needs.

Table I shows the pattern of unadjusted sur-
vival for the five categories of vision. If these
results are adjusted for age and sex, the effect of
vision on survival remains significant (p = 0.02)
and, as Table II shows, the group with worst
vision still shows the best survival. No signifi-
cant difference was found between group 1 with
the best vision and group 5 with the worst
vision, or between the three intermediate cate-
gories. However, groups 1 and 5 together are
significantly different from the other groups
(p = 0.02).
There are many interrelated reasons which
might explain the good survival of the group
with worst vision. A number of factors that are
suspected of being linked with mortality show
a similar pattern to mortality when looked at
together with vision. Here we consider six such
factors; living alone, incontinence, social isola-
tion, dementia, physical activity and unmet

important to ensure that the samples used were
not biased. Selection bias and non-response
would have a major impact on the results. Two
checks for bias were made in this study.
In the original survey the elderly had been
asked to assess their own vision problems as
none, moderate or severe. Although subjective,
this measure does give some indication as to
whether the selection for the subsequent eye
survey was biased. Testing for a difference in
the person's self-assessment of vision problems,
between those selected and those not selected,
produces a non-significant result (p = 0.65).
The eye survey involved a long and detailed
examination of each subject and the entire study
took nearly two years to complete. During this
time a number of potential subjects died or
moved from the district and therefore those
included in the eye survey tend to show better
survival than those who were omitted. How-
ever, there is no evidence to suggest any associ-
ation between survival, inclusion in the eye
survey and the subjective assessment of eye
problems (p = 0.83).
Discussion
The tests that related the assessments of vision
of the two surveys showed that selection bias
was not a problem for this study, and therefore
Tables I and II give a true reflection of the
association between survival and visual impair-
ment. The most notable aspect of these results
is the good survival observed in vision category
5, those with the poorest vision. This group
showed similar survival to those with un-
impaired vision. People in the intermediate
categories survived less well.
Fig. 1 shows that living alone is related to
visual impairment in much the same way as
survival and shows that a blind person is more
likely to live with a sighted friend or relative
than is a less seriously visually-impaired per-
son. Living alone is closely related to social
isolation, a factor that was linked by Blazer [5]
to elderly persons' survival. As Fig. 2 shows,
those with the worst vision have, on average,
more social contact than those with a less
serious visual impairment.
Maule et al. [15] found an association
between chronic brain syndrome and poor
vision, and dementia has been shown to be
associated with survival [3, 11]. As Fig. 3
illustrates, dementia is also associated with
vision. The plot gives the percentage of people
obtaining full marks on the dementia test. In
this test the elderly blind and those with 6/6
vision performed equally well. Perhaps more
surprisingly, the blind also show comparatively
high physical activity scores (Fig. 4).
Unmet need, as illustrated by Fig. 5, is less in
the blind than it is in those with less serious
visual impairments. This reflects their better
contacts, both socially and with local agencies.
If the blind are treated as an exception, then a
decrease in vision results in a general worsening
of survival chances and correlates well with the
known risk factors, isolation, dementia, physi-
cal activity and unmet need. When assessing
risk, those who are blind or nearly so need to be
treated as a separate group. They are generally
less isolated, better cared for and in a better
mental state than those with less serious visual
impairment.
Chamberlain [16] found that the use of
Snellen charts together with a reading test only
had a 75% sensitivity when compared with an
ophthalmologist's assessment of visual impair-
ment. The specificity of 70% was also fairly
low. Despite these disappointing 
findings,
Snellen charts have considerable advantages.

They are objective, easy and quick to use, and
they require a minimum of training for the
interviewer. What is more, the results pres-
ented here show that visual acuities measured
with Snellen charts correlate with survival and
are thus suitable for inclusion in any battery of
tests given to identify high-risk elderly people.
Visual impairment has two potential uses in
screening. It might be used to identify geo-
graphical regions that require extra resources
for the care of the elderly, or it might be used to
identify individuals who require extra care.
These two aspects will be considered in turn.
When looking for geographical areas that
require extra provision, comparisons are often
made on the basis of readily available data, such
as the percentage of the elderly who live alone.
These data are usually taken from national
sources such as the Census or General House-
hold Survey.
It might appear that the size of the blind
register would also be a suitable measurement
with which to compare geographical areas.
However, our results show that the blind sur-
vive well and are already generally well cared
for. Thus the blind register will not measure the
size of the high-risk elderly population in any
area. A more suitable measure would be the true
size of the population eligible for partial-sight
registration. Unfortunately, partial sight is
notoriously under-registered [17, 18], and the
partial-sight register shows large regional dif-
ferences [19]. Gibson et al. [20] found that in
this particular population the sensitivity of the
partial-sight register was only 50% and that the
register underestimated the prevalence of par-
tial sight by a factor of 1.5. As a consequence the
sizes of the blind and partial-sight registers are
not suitable measures for use in this type of
service planning.
Considering next the screening of high-risk
individuals, the results of this study show that
visual impairment is an indicator of survival but
that the visual acuities need to be interpreted
with care. Greater visual impairment is linked
to worse survival chances only so long as the
person is not blind. People with virtually no
vision need to be considered separately.
Visual impairment might be associated with
survival through any, or all, of the four routes
described earlier. It may act as a social factor by
inhibiting elderly people's ability to care for
themselves. It may act as a marker for an
underlying disease, as for example in the way
that retinal vascular disease is associated with
hypertension [21]. There may be a psychologi-
cal effect on the elderly person due to an
association between visual impairment and loss
of independence, or it may be that any visual
impairment is a result of intrinsic (genetically
determined) ageing.
The main effects of ageing on the eye [22-24]
are that the lens becomes more opaque and loses
some of its power to focus, and the macula may
lose some of its ability to resolve fine detail. It
has been estimated that the retina of an elderly
eye may receive only one-third of the light that
it received when young [22]. It is possible that
the degree of ageing of the eye will reflect the
degree of ageing of the body as a whole and
hence that visual impairment will reflect general
health and biological as opposed to chronologi-
cal age.
It is likely, as Brauer et al. [3] have suggested
in relation to other risk factors, that the associ-
ation between vision and survival is mainly not
causal. Instead both factors reflect the general
health of the individual. The small causal
component will result from such factors as falls,
reduced exercise levels and difficulty preparing
food, and although this component in the
association is smaller it will be susceptible to
intervention.
The good survival found in the blind is quite
consistent 
with 
a non-causal 
relationship
between visual impairment and survival. It
arises because blindness is associated with non-
fatal diseases, whereas smaller degrees of visual
impairment reflect a general deterioration in
health. The results show that the elderly blind
are generally better cared for by society than
those with a less serious visual impairment, but
this is not necessarily responsible for their
improved survival.

Organization

recently called for the evaluation of screening
programmes for the elderly. In such evaluations
it is important not to place too much emphasis
on survival as a measure of outcome. Although
objective, easy to measure and to some extent
predictable, survival is unlikely to be improved
significantly by intervention. Benefit is more
likely to be shown in quality of life.

visual impairment, it may be impossible to
restore their vision and it may be impossible to
improve their survival chances. However, an
elderly person who is visually impaired is likely
to be suffering from other social disadvantages
and these at least may be tackled so as to
improve their quality of life.
