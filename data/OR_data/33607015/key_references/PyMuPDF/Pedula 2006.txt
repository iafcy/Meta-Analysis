OBJECTIVES: To determine whether poorer visual acuity
and contrast sensitivity are independent risk factors for
all-cause and traumatic mortality in older women.
DESIGN: Twelve-year prospective cohort study (1986–2003).
SETTING: Four U.S. clinical centers.
PARTICIPANTS: Nine
thousand
seven
hundred
four
postmenopausal white women aged 65 and older.
MEASUREMENTS: Habitually corrected binocular visual
acuity and low- and high-frequency contrast sensitivity
were measured at baseline using a standard protocol. A
study physician adjudicated the primary cause of death
from death certiﬁcates and medical record review.
RESULTS: During an average of 12.2 years of follow-
up, 3,427 women died (35%), 72 (0.7%) from traumatic
events. In multivariate models adjusted for age, chronic
medical problems, and smoking, all-cause mortality risk
was 19% greater for persons in the worst quartile of visual
acuity than for those in the best (hazard ratio (HR) 5 1.19,
P 5.008) and 39% greater for persons with the worst
contrast sensitivity (HR 5 1.39, Po.001) than for those
with the best. Traumatic mortality risk was 2.4 times greater
for women with the worst contrast sensitivity than for those
with the best (HR 5 2.44, P 5.03).
CONCLUSION: Poorer visual acuity and contrast sensi-
tivity are associated with greater risk of traumatic and all-
cause mortality in older women, even after controlling for
demographic and clinical characteristics. Although further
research is necessary to determine how treating reversible
causes of visual impairment or improving current refraction
affects mortality in older women, clinical detection and
follow-up of these visual impairments holds promise for
identifying those who are at risk of mortality from other
systemic conditions. J Am Geriatr Soc 54:1871–1877, 2006.

V
isual impairment is one of the most common condi-
tions affecting older individuals. Approximately 92%
of persons aged 70 and older require corrective lenses, and
2% are legally blind without correction.1 Additionally,
14% of persons aged 70 to 74 and 32% of persons aged 85
and older report trouble seeing even while wearing glasses.1
Visual impairment likely reﬂects biological aging and
disease processes, and its health effect is substantial. Im-
paired vision increases the risk of falls, hip fractures,2–8 and
decline in functional status.9–13 Although previous studies
have demonstrated a relationship between sensory impair-
ment and quality of life, they conﬂict on its relationship
with mortality.14–24 Cross-sectional design, small study
sample,
self-reported
visual
impairment,
and
limited
adjustment for the independent inﬂuence of other chronic
medical conditions have limited prior studies.
It was hypothesized that any association between visual
impairment and all-cause mortality is likely a consequence
of other comorbidities related to vision and mortality. It
was also hypothesized that, after adjustment for these med-
ical conditions, visual impairment would not be related to
total mortality. Nevertheless, it was theorized that visual
impairment is independently associated with traumatic
events and would remain predictive of traumatic mortality
even after adjustment for other risk factors. This longitu-
dinal study attempts to address these hypotheses by evalu-
ating the relationship of visual acuity and contrast
sensitivity to all-cause and traumatic mortality in a
population of older women.

ive of osteoporosis status. The sample consisted of 9,704
ambulatory white women aged 65 and older recruited from
1986 to 1988 in four metropolitan areas of the United
States: Portland, Oregon; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Balti-
more, Maryland; and the Monongahela Valley, Pennsylva-
nia. Details of the study design have been reported
elsewhere.2 All participants received a standardized inter-
view and clinical examination approximately every 2 years
after baseline, covering multiple domains of health, poten-
tial lifestyle and dietary risk factors for falls and fractures,
and sociodemographic characteristics. The institutional
review boards at each site approved the study, and all the
women provided written informed consent.
Measurements
Visual Acuity and Contrast Sensitivity
Visual acuity was assessed at baseline for all participants
using a standard protocol with trained examiners. Subjects
were asked to read the Bailey-Lovie letter chart with both
eyes open, wearing their current spectacle correction if they
usually wore glasses for distance.25 Results of this visual
acuity testing were expressed as current binocular vision.
For analytical purposes, the log minimum angle of reso-
lution (logMAR) visual acuity25 was evaluated as quartiles
of increased impairment.
Pelli-Robson letter charts were used to measure
binocular contrast sensitivity (the ability to detect subtle
differences between objects that are not black and white).26
Log contrast sensitivity scores were calculated for low and
high spatial frequencies (i.e., fat gratings and thin gratings)
normalized to the median of the study population and then
averaged across all spatial frequencies. Thus a score of 1.0
indicates a contrast sensitivity equivalent to the median for
the study population. Scores greater than 1.0 indicate a
level of contrast sensitivity better than the population
median. For analytical purposes, this average was then
evaluated as quartiles of decreasing contrast sensitivity.
Mortality
From 1986 to 2003, participants or designated proxies were
contacted by mail or telephone every 4 months for out-
comes and to verify vital status (495% complete). Death
certiﬁcates were physician-adjudicated to determine the
primary cause of death, using codes from the International
Classiﬁcation
of
Diseases,
Ninth
Revision,
Clinical
Modiﬁcation (ICD-9-CM). Traumatic deaths were deﬁned
as ICD-9-CM codes 800 to 995.
Other Measurements
Demographic characteristics, self-reported health status,
history of medical conditions, falls, and smoking status
were obtained via a questionnaire reviewed by trained in-
terviewers.
For
medical
conditions
such
as
diabetes
mellitus, stroke, and cataract, the subject was asked if a
doctor had ever told her that she had the condition. Med-
ication use was determined according to questionnaire
and from the pill bottles that participants brought to the
examination.
Weight and height (using a stadiometer) and knee
height were measured. Body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) was
calculated with knee height substituted for total height,
because knee height is less likely to change with age.
Hypertension was deﬁned as having measured blood pres-
sure greater than 160/90 mmHg or taking thiazide diuretics.
Frailty measures included whether the subject could rise
from a chair (without using her arms) ﬁve times and
whether the subject was resting (off her feet) more than 4
hours per day. Functional disability was based on partic-
ipants’ ability to perform six activities: walking, climbing
stairs, descending stairs, preparing meals, shopping, and
doing housework.27,28
Statistical Methods
Binocular visual acuity was analyzed in three ways: as a
continuous variable using the logMAR score, as a Snellen
equivalent of 20/40 or worse, and in quartiles based on the
logMAR score. Binocular contrast sensitivity was analyzed
as a continuous measure using the average normalized score
across high and low spatial frequencies and as a categorical
variable using quartiles of contrast sensitivity. Contrast
sensitivity was averaged across low and high spatial fre-
quencies, because the low-frequency contrast sensitivity,
high-frequency
contrast
sensitivity,
and
combined-
frequency contrast sensitivity exhibited similar associations
with mortality. However, the combined frequency associ-
ation was the largest and had the greatest level of statistical
significance.
Baseline attributes were compared across quartiles of
visual acuity and contrast sensitivity using the Mantel-
Haenszel chi-square test for trend. Cox proportional
hazards analyses were used to evaluate the independent
contribution of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity to
mortality, adjusted ﬁrst for age only and then multivariate
for other signiﬁcant (Po.05) risk factors. Covariates tested
in the multivariate analyses were those found to be asso-
ciated with mortality in prior SOF analyses and included
age; BMI; mean pulse; pack-years smoked; currently living
alone; use of thiazide diuretics, nonthiazide diuretics, and
estrogen; history of diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism,
hypertension, stroke, and cataract; having fallen in past
year; number of falls in past year; self-reported health sta-
tus; history of fracture after age 50; education; functional
disability; resting off feet more than 4 hours per day; and
requiring use of arms to stand from a chair. When contrast
sensitivity and visual acuity were both independent predic-
tors of mortality, hazard ratios for each were adjusted for
the other.
Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% conﬁdence
intervals (CIs) are based on the adjusted analysis. All stat-
istical analyses were conducted using SAS version 6.12 (SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). All reported statistical tests are
two-sided, and the term ‘‘statistically signiﬁcant’’ implies
Po.05. For ease of interpretation, there was no adjustment
for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS
Women in this cohort had average age of 71.7  5.3 and a
mean BMI of 26.5  4.7 kg/m2. A total of 682 (7.0%)
reported a history of diabetes mellitus, 292 (3.0%) a history
of stroke, and 3,747 (38.9%) had hypertension. Forty-one
percent reported estrogen use (ever/current) and 35%
thiazide diuretic use. Thirty-nine percent reported past or
current smoking; 62% of these reported having smoked 15

pack-years or more. A total of 8,070 (83%) reported being
in good to excellent (as opposed to fair to poor) health, and
42% were currently living alone. Thirty-seven percent re-
ported at least one functional impairment, whereas 6.5%
had four or more. Approximately 10% of women were off
their feet for 4 or more hours per day, 4.2% required the use
of their arms to stand from a chair, and 30.1% had fallen
within the previous 12 months.
Overall, average logMAR binocular visual acuity was
0.12  0.15 and ranged from –0.28 to 1.40. This is ap-
proximately equivalent to 20/25 (range 20/12–20/500) on
the Snellen scale.29 Eight percent of subjects had currently
corrected binocular visual acuity of 20/40 or worse. Less
than 1% of participants had a logMAR of 1.0 or greater,
commonly considered legal blindness (Snellen visual acuity
20/200 or worse).30 Mean binocular normalized contrast
sensitivity was 1.27  0.75 (range 0–4.96). Thus, the aver-
age normalized contrast sensitivity across all spatial fre-
quencies was 27% higher than the population median.
During a mean follow-up of 12.2 years, 3,427 women
(35.3%) died. Of these deaths, 1,264 (36.9%) were due to
cardiovascular disease, 852 (24.9%) to cancer, 368 (10.7%)
to stroke, 296 (8.6%) to respiratory diseases, 169 (4.9%) to
mental diseases, 89 (2.6%) to digestive diseases, and 82
(2.4%) to genitourinary diseases. Trauma caused 72 deaths
(2.1%); no other category of death accounted for more than
2%. The most common causes of traumatic death were
motor vehicle accidents (n 5 21); sequelae of hip, vertebra,
or skull fractures (n 5 18); lethal hemorrhage from the
trauma (n 5 10); complications of falls (n 5 5); and other
causes from other injuries (n 5 5).
Table 1 shows that persons with poorer visual acuity
and poorer contrast sensitivity were at higher risk of all-
cause mortality and, in particular, deaths due to trauma.
All-cause mortality rates (per 100,000 person-years) ranged
from 1,816 for persons with the best baseline binocular
visual acuity to 4,715 for persons with the poorest visual
acuity. Similar rates were seen for contrast sensitivity, with
an all-cause mortality rate ranging from 1,648 per 100,000
person-years for persons with the best binocular contrast
sensitivity to 4,942 for persons with the poorest contrast
sensitivity. Traumatic mortality rates were about three times
higher for persons in the poorest visual acuity (108 per
100,000) and contrast sensitivity (113 per 100,000) quar-
tiles than for those in the best visual acuity (37 per 100,000)
and contrast sensitivity (31 per 100,000) quartiles.
Average logMAR visual acuity  standard deviation in
survivors was 0.09  0.13, compared with 0.16  0.17 in
those who died from any cause (Po.001) and 0.14  0.14
in those who died from trauma (P 5.002). Average contrast
sensitivity
in
the
surviving
group
was
1.40  0.75,
compared with 1.02  0.67 in those who died from any
cause (Po.001) and 1.03  0.62 in those who died from
trauma (Po.001). Of deaths due to all causes, 431 (12.6%)
persons had a visual acuity of 20/40 or worse at baseline,
compared with 358 (5.7%) survivors (Po.001). Eight in-
dividuals (11.1%) who died from trauma had visual acuity
of 20/40 or worse (P 5.07 compared with survivors).
In age-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, log-
MAR visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were associated
with all-cause mortality (Table 2). Relative to the ﬁrst (best)
quartile of visual acuity, each of the second, third, and
fourth quartiles showed signiﬁcantly greater risks of
all-cause mortality. A similar association was seen between
contrast sensitivity and all-cause mortality (Table 2).
The
greatest
risk
occurred
for
the
fourth
(worst)
quartile of contrast sensitivity, with an HR of 1.76 (95%
CI 5 1.58–1.97).
In addition to age, other risk factors that were inde-
pendently predictive of all-cause mortality included BMI;
pulse; pack-years smoked; living alone; history of diabetes
mellitus, hyperthyroidism, stroke, or hypertension; use of
nonthiazide diuretics; no estrogen use; history of falls;
functional disability; poorer self-reported health status; off
feet 4 or more hours per day; and required use of arms to
stand from chair. After adjustment for these, binocular

logMAR visual acuity and contrast sensitivity remained
signiﬁcant predictors of all-cause mortality, although only
the fourth quartile of logMAR visual acuity and the third
and fourth quartiles of contrast sensitivity remained
signiﬁcantly different from the ﬁrst (best) quartile of the
respective measure (Table 2).
Figure 1 displays the adjusted all-cause mortality curves
for each of the four quartiles of visual acuity (A) and contrast
sensitivity (B). This ﬁgure suggests that visual impairment is
associated with both short-term and long-term mortality. In
separate analyses, women in quartiles 3 and 4 of logMAR
visual acuity and contrast sensitivity demonstrated signiﬁ-
cantly higher mortality risk (Po.05) than those in quartile 1
as soon as 3 years of follow-up (data not shown).
In age-adjusted analyses modeling traumatic mortality
(Table 2), only the fourth quartile of impairment was sig-
niﬁcantly associated with greater risk of traumatic mortal-
ity (HR 5 2.23, 95% CI 5 1.16–4.75 for logMAR visual
acuity and HR 5 2.86, 95% CI 5 1.32–6.20 for contrast
sensitivity). After multivariate adjustment for age, BMI,
stroke, pulse, self-reported health status, and hypertension,
persons with the worst contrast sensitivity had 2.45 times as
great a risk of traumatic mortality as those with the best
contrast sensitivity (95% CI 5 1.12–5.30). Because of the
correlation between contrast sensitivity and logMAR visual
acuity (r 5 0.65), and the relatively small number of trau-
matic deaths, both visual impairment terms could not be
included in the same model. Nevertheless, when contrast
sensitivity was not included in the model, persons with the
worst logMAR visual acuity had a 39% greater risk of
traumatic mortality than those with the best visual acuity
(HR 5 1.39, 95% CI 5 1.01–4.12).
Figure 2 displays the adjusted traumatic mortality
curves for each of the four quartiles of visual acuity (A) and
contrast sensitivity (B). Although the worst quartile of log-
MAR visual acuity and contrast sensitivity exhibited a
greater risk of mortality than the other quartiles, 10 years of
follow-up was required before the association with contrast
sensitivity was signiﬁcant. The entire follow-up period was
required to detect a greater risk of traumatic mortality for
persons in the fourth quartile of logMAR visual acuity than
for those in the ﬁrst quartile.
DISCUSSION
This population-based longitudinal study of older post-
menopausal women showed that poorer visual acuity and
contrast sensitivity were independent predictors of all-cause
mortality. The risk of all-cause mortality over a 12.2-year
interval was 19% greater for persons with the worst

 All-cause mortality models were adjusted for age, body mass index, pulse, pack-years smoked, living alone, history of diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, stroke,
hypertension, use of non-thiazide diuretics, estrogen use, history of falls, self-reported health status, functional impairment, off feet 4 hours or more per day, and
required use of arms to stand from chair. The model with LogMAR visual acuity was also adjusted for contrast sensitivity, and the model with contrast sensitivity was
adjusted for LogMAR visual acuity.
w Traumatic mortality models were adjusted for age, body mass index, stroke, pulse, self-reported health status and hypertension. A small number of traumatic events
and correlation between LogMAR visual acuity and contrast sensitivity (correlation coefﬁcient 5 0.65) prevented simultaneous inclusion of both terms in the
traumatic mortality model. Thus, the traumatic mortality models do not include adjustment for the other visual impairment measure.

logMAR visual acuity than for those with the best. Women
with contrast sensitivity in the third and fourth quartiles
had 23% and 39% greater risks, respectively, of all-cause
mortality than women with the best contrast sensitivity. In
addition, the risk of traumatic mortality was 2.44 times
as great for persons in the worst quartile for contrast
sensitivity as for those in the best quartile.
Relationships between visual impairment and morta-
lity have been noted in other studies.19–22,24,31 The Beaver
Dam Eye Study found that, although persons with visual
acuity of 20/40 or worse were 1.6 times as likely to die
within 5 years as those with better visual acuity, the
relationship disappeared after adjusting for other clinical
conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus.17
A similar relationship remained signiﬁcant even after
adjustment in the Melbourne Visual Impairment Project.18
In some studies, longer follow-up was necessary to detect
associations, indicating that the effect might be indirect and
mediated by other factors. However, the current study
found signiﬁcant associations of visual acuity and contrast
sensitivity to all-cause mortality within 3 years of follow-
up, suggesting that visual impairment is associated with
short-term and long-term mortality.
The relationship between visual impairment and all-cause
mortality did not support the a priori hypothesis that this
association would disappear after adjustment for other covar-
iates. It may be that visual impairment is indeed an independ-
ent predictor of all-cause mortality, in which case there may be
opportunities to reduce death risk with interventions as simple
as refraction improvement. However, it is possible that the
association that was found was due to the presence of other
unmeasured chronic medical conditions. Leading causes of
visual impairment include glaucoma, age-related cataract,
macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy.1 Underlying
conditions that are associated with these eye diseases (e.g.,
hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and aging) are also
commonly associated with greater mortality.19,20,23,32 In this
study, every attempt was made to adjust for known confound-
ers. Hypertension, tobacco use, and diabetes mellitus were all
independent predictors of all-cause mortality. A history of age-
related cataracts was signiﬁcantly associated with mortality in
the unadjusted analyses but did not remain signiﬁcant after
adjustment. Information was unavailable about glaucoma or
macular degeneration at the baseline examination, so adjust-
ment for these conditions was not possible. However, these
diseases were not found to be related to worse survival in other
studies.17,22 Still, it is possible that visual impairment is a
marker for other systemic conditions related to mortality that
were not measured precisely (e.g., severity of diabetes mellitus).

traumatic mortality was no longer signiﬁcant. Other studies
have also failed to detect an independent relationship
between visual acuity and traumatic mortality.18,33 The
visual acuity assessment in the current study was measured
using both eyes and with current correction. Other studies
suggest that monocular impaired vision causes greater
loss of stereopsis than binocular impairment and that
monocular impaired vision is more strongly predictive of
hip fracture,3,34,35 yet in persons with age-related macular
degeneration, monocular vision has been shown to provide
better visual function than binocular vision, especially at
medium to low spatial frequencies.36 It is not clear which
method of assessing visual acuity is most valid when evalu-
ating nonophthalmic outcomes. Testing both eyes together
and using the participant’s current correction attempted to
obtain the most accurate measure of the individual’s every-
day functional acuity. It is possible that the results would be
different had best-corrected visual acuity in the better (or
worse) eye or some other measure of visual acuity been
used. It is also possible that, with the small number of
traumatic deaths, the correlation between logMAR visual
acuity and contrast sensitivity (correlation coefﬁcient 5
0.65) was such that logMAR visual acuity did not add sig-
niﬁcantly to the prediction model.
Poor contrast sensitivity has been linked to accidents,
self-reported limitation of night-time driving, and falls and
fractures.37–39 The results of the current study relating
poorer contrast sensitivity to deaths that follow these types
of events amplify the importance of identifying contrast
sensitivity as a risk factor, especially because evidence sug-
gests that improvement in visual functioning can positively
affect quality of life and reduce accidents.40
Strengths of this study include the long follow-up and
low attrition of this cohort, although because this study
consisted of community-dwelling elderly white women,
relationships may differ for men, frailer or younger women,
or women from other racial or ethnic groups. Furthermore,
although other clinical characteristics known to be related
to mortality were controlled for, it is possible that other
unmeasured factors may have modiﬁed the results.
In conclusion, it was found that women with poorer
visual acuity using current correction and those with poorer
contrast sensitivity were at greater risk of mortality; this
association
remained
despite
controlling
for
several
potential confounders including health status and medical
comorbidities. It is not clear that decreasing visual impair-
ment would reduce mortality, but if improvement in visual
function reduces accidents and falls, then mortality result-
ing from these traumatic events could also decrease. In
addition, clinically identifying persons with poor visual
acuity and contrast sensitivity may help to identify those
with underlying conditions that, when treated, could reduce
all-cause mortality.
