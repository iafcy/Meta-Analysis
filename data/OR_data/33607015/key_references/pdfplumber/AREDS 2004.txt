Associations of Mortality With Ocular Disorders and an
Intervention of High-Dose Antioxidants and Zinc in the Age-
Related Eye Disease Study:
AREDS Report No. 13
,*
AREDS Research Group
Abstract
Objective—To assess the association of ocular disorders and high doses of antioxidants or zinc
with mortality in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS).
Methods—Baseline fundus and lens photographs were used to grade the macular and lens status
of AREDS participants. Participants were randomly assigned to receive oral supplements of high-
dose antioxidants, zinc, antioxidants plus zinc, or placebo. Risk of all-cause and cause-specific
mortality was assessed using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.
Results—During median follow-up of 6.5 years, 534 (11%) of 4753 AREDS participants died. In
fully adjusted models, participants with advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
compared with participants with few, if any, drusen had increased mortality (relative risk [RR], 1.41;
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08–1.86). Advanced AMD was associated with cardiovascular
deaths. Compared with participants having good acuity in both eyes, those with visual acuity worse
than 20/40 in 1 eye had increased mortality (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12–1.65). Nuclear opacity (RR,
1.40; 95% CI, 1.12–1.75) and cataract surgery (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.18–2.05) were associated with
increased all-cause mortality and with cancer deaths. Participants randomly assigned to receive zinc
had lower mortality than those not taking zinc (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61–0.89).
Conclusions—The decreased survival of AREDS participants with AMD and cataract suggests
that these conditions may reflect systemic rather than only local processes. The improved survival
in individuals randomly assigned to receive zinc requires further study.
Various ocular disorders (eg, visual impairment and cataract and those in persons with diabetes
1–17
mellitus, severe retinopathy, or visual impairment) have been reported to be significant
predictors of a decreased life span, often even after extensive adjustment for potential
1–5
confounders. Cataract surgery has been associated with decreased survival in many but not
6–8
all studies. A common finding is the association between nuclear opacities, in particular,
6,7,9–11
and decreased survival. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), on the other hand,
6,8,9
has not been found to be related to decreased survival in the few studies that have examined
the relationship, although the ability to find an association is limited because few participants
in these studies had advanced disease (neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy).

Why ocular factors should be associated with decreased survival is unclear. Inadequate
adjustment for factors such as age or underlying disease related to the ocular conditions and
mortality could explain the findings. The loss of vision could have a direct effect on mortality
if it results in a susceptibility to accidents such as fatal falls or in depression, which has been
18,19
reported to increase mortality. Also, ocular disorders, in particular cataract, may be
markers of systemic processes that are associated with accelerated physiologic aging and earlier
9,20
death. For example, generalized oxidative damage might play a role in the development
of cataract and the aging process.

We undertook this study to determine whether visual impairment, type of lens opacity, cataract
surgery, and advanced AMD are associated with overall or cause-specific mortality in
participants in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a long-term study of the clinical
course of age-related cataract and AMD. Because AREDS included a randomized controlled
trial of high-dose antioxidants and zinc used for a median of 6.5 years, we also examined the
relationship between high-dose dietary supplements and mortality.
METHODS
21
Details of the AREDS design have been published previously. AREDS is an ongoing,
multicenter study of the clinical course of cataract and AMD. The study included a randomized
clinical trial that evaluated the effect of high daily doses of selected oral supplements (vitamin
C, 500 mg; vitamin E, 400 IU; beta carotene, 15 mg; and zinc, 80 mg as zinc oxide with 2 mg
of cupric oxide) on the incidence and progression of the 2 conditions. A total of 4757 persons
aged 55 to 81 years at enrollment were entered into the study at 11 clinical centers between
November 13, 1992, and January 15, 1998.
The ocular eligibility requirements were largely determined by the AMD component of
AREDS. Stereoscopic color fundus photographs taken at baseline were used to assess macular
status for this study. Photographs were assessed using the AREDS system for classifying
22
AMD by trained and certified readers at a reading center, who classified each participant
into 1 of 4 AMD categories: Category 1, few if any small drusen; Category 2, extensive small
drusen or nonextensive intermediate-sized drusen; Category 3, extensive intermediate-sized
drusen, at least 1 large druse, or noncentral geographic atrophy; and Category 4, unilateral
advanced AMD or unilateral vision loss to worse than 20/32 attributable to AMD.
Except for the requirement that all participants have at least 1 eye with visual acuity of 20/32
or better and that the media be sufficiently clear for reasonable-quality fundus photography,
lens opacity status was not otherwise considered in selecting participants. The large sample
size requirements for the AMD component of the study and the expected high prevalence of
lens opacities in the targeted age group made it likely that a diverse array of age-related lens
opacities would be present in the cohort.
23
The AREDS system for classifying cataracts was used to assess the presence and severity
of nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular (PSC) lens opacities at baseline. Lens
photographs were evaluated at a reading center by trained and certified examiners masked to
the participants’ vision status. Nuclear opacities were graded on a decimal scale using cutoff
points set by a series of standard slitlamp photographs with increasingly severe nuclear
sclerosis. Nuclear opacity grades ranged from 0.9 (severity less than the lowest lens standard
photograph) to 6.1 (severity exceeding the highest lens standard photograph). Each participant
was classified into 1 of 2 nuclear opacity groups, irrespective of the presence of cortical or
PSC opacities: less than grade 4 in both eyes or in the phakic eye if there is a history of unilateral
cataract surgery vs grade 4 or higher in at least 1 eye.

The extent of cortical and PSC opacities was graded by estimating the area of lens involvement
as seen on retroillumination photographs. Each participant was classified into 1 of 2 cortical
opacity groups, irrespective of the presence of nuclear or PSC opacities: 5% or less of the
central 5-mm area in both eyes or in the phakic eye if there is a history of unilateral cataract
surgery vs greater than 5% of the central 5-mm area in at least 1 eye.
Similarly, each participant was classified into 1 of 2 PSC opacity groups, irrespective of the
presence of nuclear or cortical opacities: 5% or less of the central 5-mm area in both eyes or
in the phakic eye if there is a history of unilateral cataract surgery vs greater than 5% of the
central 5-mm area in at least 1 eye.
Participants were also classified (yes or no) according to whether they had a history of cataract
surgery.
Baseline best-corrected visual acuity was measured in each eye according to the ETDRS
protocol as the number of letters read correctly, with scores ranging from 0 (<20/800) to 100
(20/10). Each participant was classified into 1 of 2 visual acuity groups: 20/40 or better in both
eyes (equivalent to >69 letters) vs worse than 20/40 in 1 eye.
At enrollment, AREDS participants had to be free of any illness or condition that would, in
the opinion of the enrolling physician, make long-term follow-up or compliance with use of
the study interventions unlikely or difficult. Persons with a history of cancer with a poor
prognosis for 7-year survival or a major cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event within the
year before enrollment were ineligible for AREDS. Also excluded were persons with more
than minimal diabetic retinopathy, previous ocular surgery (except cataract surgery and
unilateral photocoagulation for AMD), and the presence of any other eye disease that could
complicate assessment of the progression of lens opacities or AMD or that could affect visual
acuity (eg, optic atrophy and acute uveitis).
Simple randomization, stratified by AREDS clinical center and AMD category, was used to
enroll participants in the 2 × 2 factorial design of antioxidants and zinc. Participants in AMD
categories 2 through 4 were assigned with a probability of 0.25 to receive placebo, antioxidants,
zinc, or antioxidants and zinc. Participants in AMD Category 1 were assigned with a probability
of 0.50 to receive placebo or antioxidants. The potential risks of high-dose zinc
24
supplements if given to Category 1 participants were unlikely to be balanced by any possible
benefits. This group was at low risk of developing vision loss due to AMD during the planned
5- to 8-year follow-up phase of the clinical trial, and there is no published evidence that taking
zinc might reduce the risk of lens opacities.
Data on age, sex, race (white, other), education level (high school or less, more than high
school), and smoking status (never, former, current) were available from an interviewer-
administered baseline questionnaire. Data on diabetes mellitus, arthritis, angina, and cancer
were based on solicited self-report. As part of the clinical trial component of AREDS,
participants were given the option of taking a daily multivitamin supplement containing the
recommended daily allowance of nutrients (Centrum; Wyeth Consumer Health Care
International Inc, Madison, NJ). At the baseline examination, trained observers measured each
participant’s height and weight, which were used to calculate body mass index. Hypertension
was defined as systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure
greater than 90 mm Hg or current use of antihypertensive medications. Data on the use of
cholesterol-lowering medications, aspirin, or anti-inflammatory medications were also
collected.
The primary outcome variable for this study is all-cause mortality. When mortality was
reported, death was confirmed and the cause of death was abstracted from hospital records and

from death certificates. Cause-specific mortality was based on International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes, and analyses were performed for the major, broadly
grouped causes of death. Codes were assigned by a certified ICD-9 diagnostic coder and
reviewed by a physician medical monitor. A Morbidity and Mortality Committee consisting
of 2 physicians and a diagnostic coder reviewed the assigned codes, and discrepancies were
resolved by the medical monitor. Hospital discharge summaries were provided when available
to assist in the review. The underlying cause of death was usually selected as the primary cause.
In the absence of an underlying cause, immediate cause was selected as the primary cause.
Cause of death was unknown for 37 deaths without a death certificate or an informative
hospitalization history.
Age- and sex-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models predicting mortality were created with
AMD category, visual acuity status, nuclear opacity status, cortical opacity status, PSC opacity
status, history of cataract surgery, and assigned AREDS treatment at baseline as independent
variables. We also constructed age- and sex-adjusted models predicting mortality with the
following health status indicators: race, education, smoking status, and body mass index; use
of Centrum, aspirm/anti-inflammatory drugs, or cholesterol-lowering medications; and the
presence of angina, cancer, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and arthritis. If a health status
indicator adjusted for age and sex was not related to mortality, it was not considered further
(P>.05). Significant health status indicators (P<.05) were added to models that examined the
effect of each of the ocular characteristics on mortality. In addition, models that included
statistically significant covariates and AMD and opacity characteristics simultaneously were
assessed. Last, AMD and mortality analyses were conducted on the subset of AREDS
participants who did not receive any zinc to evaluate whether the association between AMD
and mortality is independent of an association between zinc supplements and mortality.
Statistical significance was determined using P=.05, without adjustment for multiple
comparisons. All analyses were carried out using SAS version 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc, Gary,
NC).
RESULTS
At baseline, the median age of the 4757 AREDS participants was 69 years. Between November
13, 1992, and October 12, 2001, 534 (11%) of the 4753 participants with follow-up data for
mortality died. Mortality rates, after adjustment for age and sex, for the median follow-up (6.5
years), are given in Table 1. Adjusted rates are higher for older persons, men, “other” races,
those with less formal education, current and former smokers, participants with diabetes
mellitus, participants with a lean body mass index, and those diagnosed as having comorbid
conditions, such as cancer, hypertension, and angina.
All-cause mortality rates increased with increasing severity of macular disease (Table 2). After
adjustment for age and sex, participants with advanced AMD in 1 eye (AMD Category 4)
compared with participants with few, if any, drusen (AMD Category 1) had a significantly
increased risk of mortality, and this association remained statistically significant after
adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and comorbid conditions (relative risk [RR], 1.41; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.08–1.86).
In analyses adjusted for age, sex, and statistically significant covariates, the presence of nuclear
opacity in at least 1 eye was associated with a statistically significant increased risk in all-cause
mortality (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.12–1.75). A possible increased risk was also found for cortical
(RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.92–1.51) and PSC (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.82–2.18) opacities, but these
increases were not statistically significant. Cataract surgery was statistically significantly
associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.18–2.05).

Among AREDS participants eligible to be randomly assigned to receive zinc (AMD Categories
2,3, and 4), age- and sex-adjusted all-cause mortality, as given in Table 2, was statistically
significantly reduced in the main effects analyses for participants randomly assigned to receive
any zinc (zinc alone group and antioxidants plus zinc group) compared with participants not
randomly assigned to receive zinc (placebo group and antioxidants alone group) (RR, 0.76;
95% CI, 0.63–0.92). The relationship persisted after adjustment for statistically significant
covariates (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61–0.89). No statistical association was found with
randomization to receive high-dose antioxidants and mortality whether assessing the
antioxidants main effect or the antioxidants alone effect. Covariate-adjusted survival curves
for AREDS treatment and statistically significant ocular characteristics are shown in the Figure.
The comparison of individuals randomly assigned to receive zinc alone vs those assigned to
receive placebo is statistically significant only after adjustment for all covariates (RR, 0.72;
95% CI, 0.55–0.95).
25
The AREDS clinical trial results reported that individuals randomly assigned to receive
antioxidants and zinc reduced their risk of progression to AMD and loss of visual acuity. To
examine whether the association between AMD and mortality was independent of the
association found for zinc and mortality, an analysis was conducted assessing AMD and
mortality in the subgroup of AREDS participants in AMD Categories 2 through 4 not randomly
assigned to receive any zinc-containing supplement along with participants in AMD Category
1. In this subgroup of participants, advanced AMD remained a statistically significant risk
factor for mortality in a covariate-adjusted model (RR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.13–2.07).
Compared with participants having better than 20/40 visual acuity in both eyes, those with
visual acuity worse than 20/40 in 1 eye had a statistically significantly increased risk of all-
cause mortality (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12–1.65). Ninety-one percent of participants who had
reduced vision at baseline (visual acuity <20/40 in 1 eye) were in AMD Category 4. Thus, the
association between visual impairment and mortality cannot be distinguished from the
association between AMD and mortality.
When AMD category and “any” lens opacity (defined as nuclear, cortical, or PSC opacity or
cataract surgery) are included in a covariate-adjusted model (model 1), AMD Category 4 and
“any” opacity are statistically significantly associated with all-cause mortality (Table 3). Two
additional models were developed to determine whether advanced AMD along with specific
lens opacities are particularly associated with mortality. In model 2, nuclear opacity replaces
any lens opacity from model 1 and, along with AMD Category 4, remains statistically
significant. Finally, in model 3, cataract surgery replaces any lens opacity from model 1 and,
along with AMD Category 4, remains statistically significantly associated with mortality in a
multivariate model.
The ICD-9 codes for cause of death were available for 497 of the deaths (93%). Most of these
deaths were from diseases of the circulatory system (40%) and neoplasms (34%). We grouped
all other causes of death, except “unknown” (n=37), into an “other” category (27%). The
specific causes of death for each of these broad categories are given in Table 4.
In covariate-adjusted analyses of cause-specific mortality, AMD Category 4 was statistically
significantly associated with cardiovascular deaths (RR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.18–3.12) (Table 5).
Nuclear opacity (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.05–2.31) and cataract surgery (RR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.45–
3.60) were statistically significantly associated with cancer deaths. Nuclear opacity was also
statistically significantly associated with “other” deaths (RR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.07–2.51).
Given the suggestion of a mortality benefit for participants supplementing with zinc, analysis
of cause-specific mortality in AMD Category 2 through 4 participants was performed. Zinc
supplementation did not show a protective association with circulatory or neoplasm causes of

death. A protective effect was found for “other” causes (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43–0.96). Further
analysis of this group found a nonsignificant protective effect for respiratory causes, the largest
subgroup of the other causes (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.41–1.47). No cause-specific associations
of antioxidants with mortality were found.
COMMENT
All-cause mortality was 11% during a median of 6.5 years of follow-up and was increased in
AREDS participants in AMD Category 4 and in those with nuclear lens opacities or a history
of cataract surgery when potentially confounding covariates were taken into account. No
statistically significant associations with all-cause mortality were noted for persons with less
severe age-related macular changes (AMD Categories 2 and 3), cortical lens opacities, or PSC
lens opacities.
In an analysis of cause-specific mortality, AMD Category 4 was associated with an increased
risk of death caused by diseases of the circulatory system. Persons with nuclear opacities or a
history of cataract surgery had increased mortality from neoplasms and “other” causes
compared with persons without these lens-related characteristics.
A statistically significant predictor of mortality in AREDS was AMD Category 4. Three
6,8,9
population-based studies have reported no association between mortality and AMD, but
each had few participants with advanced AMD. With eligibility criteria that permitted visual
impairment only in 1 eye (all AREDS participants had at least 1 eye with 20/32 or better visual
acuity at baseline), we noted an association between impaired vision and increased mortality.
However, the AREDS mortality findings for visual acuity and AMD were not independent.
Ninety-one percent of participants in AREDS who had visual acuity less than 20/40 at baseline
in 1 eye were in AMD Category 4. This explains the similarity of findings for AMD and visual
impairment and mortality.
Large population-based studies have reported associations between impaired vision and
6,9
increased mortality. In 2 of these studies, vision impairment was defined as corrected acuity
of 20/40 or worse in the better eye. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, the Beaver Dam Eye
9
Study noted a statistically significant 57% increase in mortality for persons with impaired
vision, but the finding was not significant after adjustment for various systemic characteristics.
The 70% increased mortality risk for persons with visual impairment in the Blue Mountains
6
Eye Study was statistically significant, even after adjustment for potentially important
covariates. Data from that study suggested that the visual impairment finding was independent
8
of the presence of cataract. The Melbourne Visual Impairment Project noted a significant
increase in mortality among persons with mild visual impairment, defined as best-corrected
17 acuity less than 6/12. Data from the National Health Interview Survey, which uses self-
reports of visual impairment and ocular disease, suggest that after adjustment for various
covariates, including the presence of cataract, glaucoma, and retinopathy (but not AMD),
women who reported bilateral severe visual impairment (bilateral “blindness”) and lesser
degrees of visual impairment, compared with women who reported no impairment, had
significantly higher all-cause and cardiovascular disease–related mortality. Since data on AMD
were not collected in the National Health Interview Survey, it was not possible to examine
whether the presence of AMD was related to the visual impairment findings.
We found that nuclear opacities and a history of cataract surgery were associated with decreased
survival. Unlike the case for AMD, the cataract variables were less closely linked with visual
impairment (visual acuity <20/40 in the worse eye) in the AREDS population. Only 20% of
the visually impaired individuals had nuclear opacities, and 24% of those with nuclear opacities
had visual impairment

Our findings for nuclear cataract are largely consistent with those from earlier studies. Five
6,7,9–11
population-based studies have reported that nuclear opacities are important predictors
of mortality independent of covariate adjustment. The fact that the association between nuclear
cataract and mortality has been noted across studies of different racial groups in different
geographical areas and using different cataract classification systems strengthens the validity
of the observation that cataracts, in particular nuclear cataracts, are associated with decreased
survival. Our finding that survival might be decreased for persons with a history of cataract
surgery, however, is not consistently supported by earlier studies. Higher mortality has been
1–5
reported for persons undergoing cataract surgery compared with those in the general
population or those undergoing other elective surgical procedures. On the other hand, several
6–8
population-based studies that reported relationships between cataract and decreased
survival found no relationship between mortality and history of cataract surgery at baseline.
The many selective factors, including the presence of co-morbid conditions, that determine
whether a person undergoes an elective procedure such as cataract surgery make it difficult to
interpret cataract surgery and mortality data.
7,10,26
As in several other studies that have examined cause-specific mortality, we found that
persons with nuclear opacities were at higher risk of death from neoplasms. In the Salisbury
7
Eye Evaluation Project, mixed cataracts that included a nuclear component were associated
with a more than 2-fold increase in risk of death from cancer. Similarly, the Barbados Eye
10
Studies reported that compared with persons without cataract, persons with mixed and “any”
nuclear opacities tended to have a higher risk of death from neoplasms. In a follow-up study
of persons who had participated in the Italian-American Case-Control Study of Age-related
26
Cataract, persons with mixed cataract had a significantly increased RR of mortality from
malignancies. None of these published studies, including ours, found a statistically significant
association between lens opacities and death caused by circulatory diseases, although such an
5
association has been suggested in a study of persons with cataract extraction.
It is not clear how ocular disorders might be related to decreased survival. One possibility is
that adjustment for important comorbid conditions may have been incomplete. A hypothesis
suggested by this study, and supported at least in part by other studies, is that nuclear cataract
and AMD might each be associated with a major cause of death, that is, cancer and diseases
7,10,26
of the circulatory system, respectively. This study and others suggest a link between
nuclear cataract and cancer mortality. Even when history of cancer at the baseline examination
was included as a covariate in the full model, nuclear cataract was significantly associated with
increased mortality. However, adjustment for cancer was probably incomplete because limited
life expectancy from diseases such as cancer was an exclusion criterion for the study, and,
therefore, most life-threatening cancers probably became manifest subsequent to the baseline
examination. It is possible that similarities in the developmental processes of the 2 conditions
or the development of cataract as a by-product of cancer therapy (an explanation suggested by
7
West et al ) could explain the link. The association we noted between AMD and all-cause
mortality and death from circulatory diseases may be explained by an underlying vascular basis
27–30
for AMD, a hypothesis suggested by some epidemiologic studies. Even with adjustment
for some risk factors possibly associated with cardiovascular death and AMD (ie, age, smoking,
and hypertension), the relationship persisted, but, as for cataract, adjustment may have been
incomplete.
6,7
Other investigators have raised the possibility of a more direct effect of vision disorders on
mortality, perhaps from the depression and dependency that can accompany vision loss.
18,19
Depression has been associated with earlier death. The AREDS eligibility requirement
that participants have at least 1 eye with 20/32 or better vision may have decreased the
possibility of ocular-related depression. Also, an increased risk of falls and automobile
accidents in the visually impaired might result in excess mortality. There were few deaths from

accidents in our cohort, and our cause-specific analyses showed no evidence that the excess
mortality we noted for persons with the ocular conditions was due to death from accidents.
Persons randomly assigned to receive zinc either alone or in combination with antioxidants
compared with persons not randomly assigned to receive zinc (placebo or antioxidants alone)
had significantly improved survival from all causes. The positive association of zinc with
decreased all-cause mortality did not seem to be due to reduction in deaths involving
31
cardiovascular/circulatory disease or cancer (Table 5). Other researchers have reported a
beneficial effect of moderate doses of zinc and selenium in improving immunity and resistance
to infections in an elderly institutionalized population. It is possible that the beneficial effects
of zinc on mortality in this study may be related to an improved immune response, which is
known to decrease with aging. A separate cause-specific analysis found that the zinc effect
was in the protective direction for respiratory-specific mortality compared with no zinc, but
this finding was not statistically significant (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.41–1.47). We know that in
the AREDS population, an intake of 80 mg of zinc oxide and 2 mg of cupric oxide, with or
without antioxidant vitamins, for 5 years resulted in a median increase in serum zinc levels of
17% compared with 2% for participants not assigned to receive zinc. Whether zinc
supplementation has an effect on mortality cannot be determined from this study alone.
Additional studies are necessary before any conclusions can be made regarding the health
benefits of zinc supplementation.
Strengths of this study include the large number of participants with the ocular disorders of
interest (in particular advanced AMD), the use of standardized techniques for diagnosing the
eye conditions, the relatively long follow-up, the near complete collection of mortality data,
the ability to perform cause-specific analyses because of the large number of deaths, and the
availability of data on potentially important covariates. A concern in interpreting the findings,
as in all clinic-based studies, was the potential for bias, in particular selection bias. The control
group for AMD (Category 1) and persons with intermediate-sized drusen or extensive small
drusen (Category 2) were substantially more likely to have been volunteers from nonmedical
sources. It has been shown that volunteers for prevention studies have more formal education,
are more health conscious, and are more often employed in professional and skilled positions.
Indeed, persons with no drusen to intermediate-sized drusen at enrollment had greater
educational achievement and smoked less than persons in AMD Categories 3 and 4. There is
less concern that selection bias might explain the cataract findings because the cataract cases
were more evenly distributed across the AMD categories, making the distribution of volunteers
more comparable among those with and without cataract. Inclusion of AMD category in the
cataract analyses should also have compensated for residual imbalances in the distribution of
volunteers among those with and without cataract.
This is the first large randomized trial to report a potential benefit of the use of high doses of
zinc on survival. Other randomized studies of zinc supplementation and mortality are needed
to confirm these findings. The ocular results of this study are consistent with those of other
studies showing a potential link between various ocular disorders and survival. Cumulative
evidence from clinic- and population-based studies suggests that cataract and AMD may reflect
systemic rather than only local processes.
