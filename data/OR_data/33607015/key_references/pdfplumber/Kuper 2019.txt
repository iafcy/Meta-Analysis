Reading Centre) by a senior grader, with adjudication
by a clinician for confirmed cases and 5% of randomly
selected images to ensure quality control. The presence
of cataract was recorded by the ophthalmologist (WM) on
slit-lamp examination after pupil dilation.
Detailed interviews were undertaken in the local
language on demographic details, information on risk
factors, socioeconomic status (SES) and full medical
history.
A nurse performed and recorded measures of partici-
pants: height (Leicester Height Measure); weight (Seca
761) and three measures of blood pressure (Omron
Digital Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor Model
HEM907), each 10 min apart. Capillary blood was taken
from all participants for random blood glucose (Accu-
trend GC system).
Assessment of vital status at follow-up
Follow-up was conducted from January 2013 to March
2014. A meeting was held approximately 1 week before
the follow-up examination clinic for a given cluster. A list
of study participants was given to the chief and a local
village guide was recruited to assist location of the study
participants. The village guide was someone who knew
and was well known by the community (or the village
chief him/herself). The advance team visited homes of
baseline participants on the day prior to the examination
clinic and confirmed their identity using the national
identity cards and invited them to attend the examination
clinic the following day. All identified participants were
also asked to help locate baseline participants that had
not been found.
Each local field guide was asked to classify the baseline
study participant for that cluster as ‘available’, ‘died’,
‘moved away’ or ‘unknown’. A participant was defined to
have died if this was verified by at least two people from
among the village chief, local guide or available study
participant. Those who were known to have moved away
were contacted when possible to either arrange follow-up
at a more suitable location for the participant or to iden-
tify if they were alive or had died in the follow-up period.
Any participant for whom nobody could identify as being
alive or having moved away was recorded as ‘unknown’.
Definitions and statistical analyses
All participants who had complete examinations at
baseline were considered ‘at-risk’ for mortality during
follow-up. Follow-up status at 6 years was categorised as:
(1) deceased (confirmed dead, as described above); (2)
alive (ie, re-examined at follow-up, retraced but refused
or unavailable at follow-up, or moved away but known
to be alive) (3) unknown (ie, not retraced at follow-up,
death not verified as described above or moved away but
vital status unknown).
An SES score was developed based on information collected on job, housing conditions and ownership of
material goods and livestock, based on previous work in
the same population.25 Hypertension was defined on the
