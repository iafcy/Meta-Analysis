Abstract
Objectives—To evaluate the association of mortality with visual acuity (VA) impairment, age-
related macular degeneration (AMD), and cataract surgery.
Design—Cohort study
Subjects—Participants with at least intermediate AMD enrolled in a randomized controlled
clinical trial of lutein/zeaxanthin and/or omega-3 fatty acids, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2
(AREDS2) for treatment of AMD and cataract.
Methods—Baseline and annual eye examinations included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)
assessments, slit lamp examinations, and stereoscopic fundus photographs that were centrally
graded for development of late AMD (central geographic atrophy or neovascular AMD) or
pseudophakia. Cause-specific mortality was determined based on ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes. Risk of
all-cause and cause-specific mortality was assessed with Cox proportional hazards models
adjusted for age, sex, AMD severity, VA, history of cataract surgery, and assigned AREDS2 study
treatment. Analyses included baseline covariates: race, education, smoking status, diabetes, and
cardiovascular disease.
Results—During follow-up (median 5 years), 368 (9%) of the 4203 AREDS2 participants died.
Participants with neovascular AMD in 1 eye at baseline had a statistically significant increased
risk for mortality compared to participants with no or few drusen (hazard ratio [HR] 1.56, 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.21–2.01; p-value [p]<0.001). Poorer survival was associated with
bilateral cataract surgery prior to enrollment compared with baseline bilateral phakia (HR, 1.63;
95% CI, 1.29–2.07; p<0.001); and with BCVA of less than 20/40 compared with participants with
20/40 or better (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.06–2.30; p=0.024), adjusted for age, sex and statistically

significant covariates. Participants who received anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies
for neovascular AMD had decreased mortality compared with those who did not (HR: 0.71, 95%
CI 0.57–0.88; p=0.002). The association between all-cause mortality and AREDS2 treatment
whether assessing the main or individual treatment effect was not significantly different [omega-3
fatty acids main effect HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.96–1.45, p=0.12; lutein/zeaxanthin main effect HR
1.04, 95% CI 0.85–1.28, p=0.71].
Conclusions—In AREDS2, the presence of late AMD, bilateral cataract surgery and visual
acuity less than 20/40 were associated with decreased survival. However, oral supplementation
with omega-3 fatty acids, lutein plus zeaxanthin, zinc, or beta-carotene had no statistically
significant impact on mortality.
Introduction
Age-related eyes diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataract
are the leading causes of visual impairment in the older population in the United States.1
Visual impairment has been reported to be associated with mortality in several
studies2–7, 11,12,19,23,29. Although the relationship between AMD or cataract with survival
has been less clear, AMD was associated with decreased survival in some studies7–8,11–12,
but others reported no statistical significance after adjustment for appropriate
confounders3,13,18–19,28. The pathogenesis of AMD is unknown; however, it is commonly
noted that AMD shares several risk factors for cardiovascular and other systemic
comorbidities that could attribute to shorter survival12,14–17. However, few studies have
evaluated the impact of late AMD (non-foveal or center-involved geographic atrophy or
neovascularization) on mortality in a large cohort. Cataract has been linked to decreased
survival, particularly for the nuclear opacity type vs cortical or subcapsular, in
some2–3, 8–10, 19–21 but not all studies13, 18,28. The association of mortality and a clinical
history of cataract surgery has not been well established26–27,29–32. While reasons for
shorter survival in persons with cataracts or cataract surgery are not known, the presence of
cataract may be possible markers for biological aging. The role of oxidative stress and
inflammatory processes may also be suggested by previous studies of decreased survival
with cataract3,8,26–27.
The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) is a randomized, clinical trial of
nutritional supplements in persons with at least intermediate AMD. The mean age of the
population was 74 years of age and they were followed for a median follow-up of 5 years.24
The AREDS2 study offers an opportunity to study the relationship of ocular diseases and
mortality. This current study is undertaken to assess the impact of visual impairment, AMD,
and history of cataract surgery on survival.
Methods
Study Population
The AREDS2 study, a randomized, double-masked, controlled trial of oral supplements
sponsored by the National Eye Institute, enrolled between 2006 and 2008, 4,203 men and
women aged 50 to 80 with bilateral intermediate AMD or late AMD in one eye. The study

concluded in October 2012 with a median follow-up of 5 years. This 2x2 factorial trial
evaluated the addition of high dose antioxidants lutein (10mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg) and/or
omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids: docosahexaenoic acid (DHA [350mg]) and
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA [650mg]) to the original AREDS formulation in reducing the
primary outcome of AMD and cataract progression. The original AREDS formulation
consisted of vitamin C (500mg), E (400 IU), beta-carotene (15mg), zinc (80mg as zinc
oxide), and copper (2mg as cupric oxide). The AREDS2 participants underwent primary
randomization to four arms: controls (n=1012), lutein/zeaxanthin (n=1044), DHA plus EPA
(n=1069), and a combination of lutein/zeaxanthin and DHA plus EPA (n=1078).
Approximately three-quarters of the population agreed to a secondary randomization that
tested the original AREDS supplements with and without beta-carotene (15mg) and high
(80mg) or low-dose (25mg) zinc formulations.34
Participants eligible for the study included those who were willing and able to undergo
yearly examination for at least five years and demonstrated adherence to the run-in regimen
(consumption of 75% of run-in medication determined by pill weight or pill count).
Participants had to be free of any health conditions that would make follow-up or
compliance with study interventions difficult. Participants with any systemic disease with a
poor 5-year survival prognosis or had previous retinal or ocular surgeries (other than cataract
extraction) that may confound evaluation were excluded. This study protocol was reviewed
and approved by each of the institutional review boards, and written informed consent was
obtained from all participants. The research was conducted according to the tenets of the
Declaration of Helsinki and complied with the Health Portability and Accountability Act.
Baseline and annual study visits included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) assessment,
slit lamp examination, dilated fundus examinations and ocular imaging (red reflex lens
photos, stereoscopic color fundus photographs, and fundus autofluorescence). At baseline
visits, participant demographics including education level, smoking status, comorbidity such
as diabetes or cardiovascular health, and medication use were collected. At telephone
interviews at the 6-month interval between annual study visits, we gathered data on the
occurrence of cataract surgery, AMD treatment, and other medical conditions as well as
adverse effects. The ocular images were evaluated at baseline and annually by certified and
trained masked readers at a central reading center at the University of Wisconsin.
Participants enrolled in the study were at high risk for progression to late AMD ranging
from bilateral large drusen to large drusen in one eye and late AMD in the fellow eye. This
translates to the AREDS AMD Simple Scale of 2, 3, and 4.35 The simple scale was a person-
scale that included both eyes and the scale was based upon the presence of large drusen or
retinal pigment epithelial hypo/hyperpigmentary changes or the presence of late AMD.35, 25
The reading center also evaluated the progression to late AMD (either central geographic
atrophy or neovascular AMD) based upon stereoscopic fundus photographs obtained at
annual visits. The presence of pseudophakia was also noted on the red reflex lens photos as
well as at the slit lamp examination at the study visit.

Primary Outcome Measure
The primary outcome measure for this study was all-cause mortality. The underlying cause
of death (defined by the World Health Organization [WHO] as the injury or the disease that
initiated events that led to death } was usually selected as the primary cause of death. In the
case that the death certificate was not provided then the immediate cause of death was used.
The immediate cause of death is defined by WHO as the disease or injury that led directly to
the cause of death. In cases of discrepancy, a mortality review team consisting of diagnostic
coders and physicians determined the cause of death.
Statistical Analysis
Risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality was assessed using age and sex-adjusted Cox
proportional hazards regression models with AMD severity (Simple Scale score 1 to 4) and
type of late AMD, neovascular or geographic atrophy associated with AMD, visual acuity
(VA), history of cataract surgery prior to enrollment, and assigned AREDS2 treatment as
independent variables to estimate risk ratios. Baseline covariates included race (non-
Hispanic white vs other), education (high school or less vs. more than high school), smoking
status (never, former, or current), diabetes, medication-use (Centrum multivitamins and/or
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)/other anti-inflammatory agents), cancer,
and cardiovascular health status (history of congestive heart disease, coronary heart disease,
angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hypercholesterolemia). Analyses also included
self-reported hypertension as a covariate. Significant covariates (P<0.05) were added to
models predicting the effects of ocular characteristics on mortality. Age was stratified to 4
different age groups: <65 years, 65–74 years, 75–79 years and ≥80 years, since this covariate
has been strongly associated with risk of developing AMD and mortality7,11. All analyses
were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
Between 2006 and 2008, AREDS2 enrolled 4,203 participants aged 50 to 80 years with
bilateral intermediate AMD or late AMD in one eye. The median age at baseline was 74
years and 57% were women. From September 2006 to December 2012, 368 (9%) of the
AREDS2 study population died. The effects of baseline characteristics on all-cause mortality
are shown in Table 1. After adjustment for age and sex, mortality rates were higher for
increasing age. The hazard ratios (HRs) for age-stratified analysis almost doubled for each
decade of age (65–74 years, HR of 2.25; 75–79 years, HR of 4.64; 80+ years, HR of 7.79).
Adjusted mortality rates were lower for females, “other” races (black, Asian and others), and
participants with education level more than high school. Mortality rates were higher for
current smokers, persons with diabetes, and participants with high blood pressure and
history for CVD (congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, and
stroke).
All-Cause Mortality
All-cause mortality rates are shown in Table 2. Mortality rates increased with increasing
AMD severity in age and sex adjusted Cox-regression models, adjusting for all the
covariates. Persons with the most severe AMD simple scale of 4 had a hazard ratio (HR) of

1.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19–2.50, p-value (p)=0.004, when compared with
simple scale of 1 and 2, which consist of milder disease with either large drusen in only one
eye or large drusen in both eyes or retinal pigment epithelial changes. Those participants
with AREDS Simple Scale level 3 were also at an increased risk of mortality with HR of
1.60, 95% CI: 1.07–2.40, p=0.022. When the severity of AMD was classified as
intermediate, geographic atrophy at the center, or neovascular AMD, the risk of mortality
was associated with neovascular AMD (HR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.21–2.01; p < 0.001). Note in
this comparison, the reference group consisted of those with intermediate AMD in both
eyes.
Mortality rates were higher for those participants who had bilateral cataract surgery prior to
enrollment into AREDS2 (HR of 1.63, 95% CI: 1.29–2.07; p<0.001) compared with no
surgery. BCVA less than 20/40 in one or both eyes were associated with statistically
significant increased risk of all-cause mortality. For unilaterally affected participants, the HR
was 1.32 and 95% CI 1.05–1.66; p=0.017 while for bilaterally affected, the HR was 1.56;
95% CI, 1.06 – 2.30; p=0.024 when compared with participants with vision better than
20/40 in both eyes. The association between all-cause mortality and the AREDS2 treatment
effect whether assessing the main effect of each nutrient or individual treatment arms was
not significant after adjustments for age, sex, demographics, lifestyle and comorbid
conditions. As previously published38, the main treatment effects of combination DHA and
EPA and the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin did not show significant benefit or harm on
mortality (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.96–1.45; p=0.12 and HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.85–1.28; p=0.71,
respectively). No statistical association was found with primary randomization of individual
treatment groups DHA/EPA and lutein/zeaxanthin (Table 2). AREDS2 treatment secondary
randomization to high (80 mg) vs low zinc (25 mg) and beta-carotene vs no beta-carotene
did not have a significant effect on mortality (Table 2). Kaplan-Meier curves for mortality by
AREDS AMD simple scale score, cataract surgery, visual impairment, and AREDS2
nutritional treatments are demonstrated in Figure 1(A, B, C, and D).
Cause-Specific Mortality
Cause-specific mortality rates are shown in Table 3. Neovascular AMD was associated with
a statistically significant increase in circulatory system and neoplastic causes of death, HR of
1.68 (95% CI 1.04–2.71; p=0.034) and HR of 1.87 (95% CI 1.08–3.24; p=0.027),
respectively (Table 3). Geographic atrophy was associated with neoplastic causes of death,
HR of 3.37 (95% CI 1.56– 7.29, p=0.002). For other causes of mortality which include
infections, pneumonia, chronic pulmonary disease, trauma and others, more severe AMD as
classified by the AREDS simple scale, specifically simple scale scores of 3 and 4 were
associated with increased risk of mortality: HR: 1.89 (95% CI: 1.01–3.55; p=0.048) and HR:
2.29 (95% CI: 1.28–4.10; p=0.005), respectively (Table 3). Bilateral cataract surgery and
bilateral visual impairment were also associated with increased risk of other-cause mortality:
HR: 2.12 (95% CI: 1.51–2.97; p<0.001) and HR: 2.17 (95% CI: 1.35–3.50; p=0.001),
respectively (Table 3).

Anti-VEGF Therapies and Mortality
Since 1,606 AREDS2 participants received anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
therapy for neovascular AMD, we evaluated the impact of this therapy on all-cause
mortality. There was reduced mortality risk for those receiving anti-VEGF therapies with the
HR of 0.71 and 95% CI of 0.57–0.88, p=0.002 (Table 2).
Causes of Death
Specific causes of death and broad-based groupings are shown in Table 4. ICD-9 and
ICD-10 codes were available for cause of death for 325 (88.3%) out of 368 participants who
died. Some of the known causes of deaths were cardiovascular (88/269 or 23.9%) and
neoplastic (90/269 (24.4%) in origin (Table 4). Cause of death was unknown for 43(11.7%)
participants without sufficient mortality follow-up data while the remainder were due to a
number of other causes (147/368 or 39.9%) (Table 4).
Discussion
As expected, the mortality rates were increased in those AREDS2 participants who were
older, current smokers, had diabetes, less formal education and/or comorbid cardiovascular
conditions. We also found an association of increased mortality in those with more severe
AMD, either simple score 3 and 4 or those with late forms of AMD, neovascular AMD or
geographic atrophy. Previous studies assessing the relationship between AMD and mortality
have been inconclusive.3,7–8,10–13,18–19,28 During a median follow-up of 6.5 years, the
original AREDS study found decreased survival in those with late AMD compared to those
with mild AMD in fully-adjusted models (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.08–1.86).8 The Reykjavik
Study which examined mortality in association with AMD in community-dwelling elders
found that participants 83 years and older had significantly increased all-cause mortality risk
(HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.20–2.57) and CVD (HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.41–3.98) in the presence of late
AMD. No association was seen in individuals with early AMD at any age and late AMD in
those <83 years.11 A study assessing AMD and mortality over a 15-year follow-up period in
a population of older women in the United States also showed increased all-cause mortality
(HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.13–1.78) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.01–2.09) for
those 80 years and older with any AMD. In this same study, late AMD was associated with
cardiovascular disease mortality in women younger than 80 years.7 In contrast, five large
population-based cohort studies, including the Rotterdam Study13, Beijing Eye Study19,
Beaver Dam Eye Study3, Blue Mountains Eye Study10, and Singapore Malay Eye Study18
showed no statistically significant association between late AMD and decreased survival.
The mean age of participants in these studies were younger (range 60–70 years) and had
fewer participants with late AMD than those in the AREDS2 cohort (mean age 74 years). In
the Atherosclerosis in the Community Study, persons with late AMD were more likely in 10
years to die (23.5%) compared with those without late AMD (8.9%, p=0.088). Those with
late AMD were also more likely to develop incident cardiovascular event (30.9%) vs. those
without late AMD (10.0%, P=0.049).39 After the 10 years of follow-up in participants aged
less than 75 years at baseline, the Blue Mountains Eye Study reported both two-fold and
five-fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in those persons with early AMD or late
AMD, respectively.40 Late AMD also predicted a ten-fold higher risk of stroke mortality.

In the analyses for the cause-specific mortality in AREDS2, it appeared that two specific
causes, cardiovascular (or circulatory), neoplastic and other causes were associated with
more severe AMD. The cause-specific mortality for neovascular AMD was associated with
both circulatory system and neoplasms while central geographic atrophy was associated with
neoplasms. When the AMD was classified by the AREDS simple scale, both levels 3 and 4
were found to be associated with other causes of death. Participants with late AMD are
likely to be older with comorbidities impacting survival. We cannot fully adjust for the
effects of age and other unknown confounders.
For both visual impairment (BCVA <20/40 in both eyes) and bilateral cataract surgery in
AREDS2 participants, we found a doubling of the risk of mortality compared to those
without visual impairment or bilateral cataract surgery. Similarly, in AREDS, visual
impairment (BCVA <20/40 in at least one eye) and cataract surgery were also associated
with decreased survival.8 Late AMD was strongly associated with visual impairment, and
the visual impairment findings in AREDS were not independent from AMD severity. Other
studies that evaluated the impact of visual impairment on mortality independent of other
comorbidities or risk factors reported conflicting results. The Blue Mountains Eye Study
found no association of visual impairment with mortality.10 The Beaver Dam Eye Study3
reported a significant association with visual impairment and all-cause mortality after
adjustment for systemic and lifestyle characteristics. The Melbourne Visual Impairment
Project5,22 noted more than a two-fold increase in mortality risk in fully-adjusted models for
participants with BCVA <6/18, suggesting that visual impairment may be associated with
increased falls and accidents contributing to increased mortality rates. However, it is
uncertain to what extent AMD status plays a role in visual impairment, since AMD data
were not collected on these participants.
The relationship between age-related cataract and poor survival has been observed in several
epidemiology studies2,3,8,10,19–21. In previous analysis of the AREDS cohort, all-cause
mortality was significantly increased for those participants with nuclear cataract or history of
cataract surgery8. These participants also had increased deaths from neoplasms. History of
bilateral cataract surgery at baseline was statistically significantly associated with all-cause
mortality but not related to neoplastic causes in the AREDS2 cohort. Cataract surgery was
associated with other causes of death. History of cataract surgery has not been consistently
shown to be associated with poor survival in prior studies26–27,31–32. Several large
population-based studies that reported no association between cataract surgery at baseline
and mortality include the Rotterdam Study13, Singapore Malay Eye Study18, and the Blue
Mountains Eye Study3. However, a retrospective cohort study investigating a random 5%
sample of the United States Medicare population (2002–2012) with cataract (1.5 million
participants) found that those who underwent cataract surgery and followed up for an
average of close to 3 years had a lower adjusted hazard of mortality compared to those
surgery-free (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.72–0.74)9. This study and others29,30 reported a protective
association after cataract surgery after adjusting for ocular and systemic comorbidities. The
conflicting findings from studies may arise from the inherent differences in the cataract
surgery group vs the non-surgery group. In addition, the factors involved in selecting eligible
participants for cataract surgery may further complicate data interpretation.

The mechanism of action surrounding the association between visual impairment caused by
cataract and AMD and mortality is not clear. One hypothesis supported by some studies
suggests that visual impairment may have a direct impact on survival, affecting functional
status of participants and even psychological health4,6,28. Poor vision can result in limited
mobility, falls, and accidents resulting in a variety of injuries7,9. In the AREDS2 cohort, very
few deaths were attributed to automobile accidents, falls or trauma-related deaths (0.04%).
Visual impairment could be associated with depression, which has been linked with poor
quality of life and decreased life span23,36. Cause-specific analyses did not show excess
mortality among AREDS2 participants with mental health disorders (0.03%). Ocular-related
depression may have played a factor as participants included in the study were at high risk to
progression to late AMD. However, our analyses of the test of depression, the Center for
Epidemiologic Studies’ Depression Scale (CES-D) (Table 1) which was administered at
baseline, showed no association of depression with mortality (HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.98 –
1.58, p=0.072).
The mechanisms for the association AMD and cataract with increased risk of mortality
remain to be elucidated. Analyses in the AREDS cohort suggested AMD shares risk factors
for comorbid conditions, especially cardiovascular disease12,14–17. Non-cardiovascular/non-
cancer cause-specific mortality was significant in AREDS2 follow-up with a majority of
deaths categorized under respiratory diseases (16%) or unknown (12%). Mortality was more
prevalent in elderly participants (75+ years) with severe AMD. This AMD-mortality
relationship was further supported by other studies, including the Beaver Dam Eye Study
that reported more severe AMD classification with increasing age3. Systemic processes
accelerating the aging process and contributing to poor survival could partially explain these
findings. Similarly, cataract may reflect systemic aging and possibly contribute to
inflammatory pathways leading to shorter survival8,26–27.
A somewhat surprising finding is the increased survival of those AREDS2 participants who
had received anti-VEGF therapies compared with those who have not received anti-VEGF
therapies. However, in about 40% of this group, we were not able to ascertain the number of
injections administered as these were participants who had exposure to the anti-VEGF
therapies at baseline. We collected the data on the number of anti-VEGF therapies given
only during the course of the study. The HR for mortality for the group who had exposure to
anti-VEGF at baseline but the number of injections was unknown, was not statistically
significantly different from those who had not received anti-VEGF therapy. In the
participants whose numbers of injections were known, there was a dose-response in that
participants with greater injections of anti-VEGF therapies were associated with lower
mortality. A limitation to these data was the small number of participants who received the
larger number of injections. We also found an interaction of the number of treatments with
the age of the participants. Older participants were less likely to receive anti-VEGF
therapies. Interestingly, a study from the Veterans Health Administration41 of men 55 years
or older with a diagnosis of AMD evaluated mortality among those who received anti-
vascular endothelial growth factor agents vs. those who did not. The twelve-month all-cause
mortality were 3.5% in the treated vs. 4.5% in the untreated. The adjusted analyses showed
the hazards ratio of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.74–1.06), with the point estimate also not in the
direction of harm but this was not statistically significant. The all-cause mortality risk was

similar for both administration of bevacizumab and ranibizumab. In the Inhibition of VEGF
in Age-related choroidal Neovascularisation (IVAN) trial where these two anti-VEGF
therapies were compared, using different treatment regimens, there was reduced mortality in
those participants who had continuous (monthly) administration of the anti-VEGF therapies
compared with those who had greater intervals between their “discontinuous” therapies (OR:
0.47, 95% CI: 0.22–1.03, p=0.05). Again, there was no difference in mortality between the
two anti-VEGF drugs (OR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.46–2.02, p=0.91). A possible explanation for the
reduced mortality in those who received anti-VEGF therapies may reflect a selection bias of
administering the therapy to healthier and more active participants in AREDS2. Contributing
to this selection bias is the increased mortality of those with more severe or late AMD that
may have further resulted in a more robust younger group who received additional anti-
VEGF therapies as death is truly a competing risk for this cohort. These interesting findings
warrant further studies designed to evaluate among persons with AMD the impact of anti-
VEGF therapies on mortality.
There were no statistically significant associations with all-cause mortality in participants
assigned to the AREDS2 treatment interventions. The AREDS nutritional supplement
treatment modifications of zinc and beta-carotene also showed no statistically significant
effect on mortality. Prior observational follow-up in the AREDS cohort suggested a
protective association with either zinc alone or in combination with antioxidants and
decreased all-cause mortality. No statistically significant association was found with oral
zinc supplementation at a high (80mg) or low (25mg) dose. Addition of lutein and
zeaxanthin, omega-3 fatty acids, individually or combined as well as the removal of beta-
carotene from the original AREDS formulation did not have an apparent effect on survival.
Strengths of the current study include a large cohort enrolled at 82 clinical centers across
various regions of the United States, low attrition rate, standardized gradings of fundus
photographs for reproducible study endpoints, a relatively long follow-up, almost complete
registry of deaths, and data on a variety of covariates. This study also enrolled a large
portion of participants with late AMD, increasing our power and allowing us to evaluate the
impact of late AMD on mortality independent of significant confounders. Like any other
clinical trial, the current AREDS2 participants tend to be well-educated, health-conscious
individuals are considerably more likely to volunteer in clinical trials.33,37 In this
observational portion of the study, adjustment for significant covariates may not have been
complete, as AMD shares several risk factors for many confounding comorbidities.
Participants with a history of cataract surgery at baseline may be inherently different from
those who did not undergo surgery, further confounding mortality outcomes. However,
AMD category was more evenly distributed among the cataract surgery and non-surgery
groups. Inclusion of AMD category as a significant covariate in fully-adjusted models
diminished the impact of bias on study findings.
In summary, increased mortality was associated with late AMD, bilateral cataract surgery
and visual acuity <20/40. This may indeed reflect an aging process and residual confounding
is difficult to eliminate. There was no increased mortality in those participants who received
anti-VEGF therapies throughout the study. Oral supplementation with AREDS2 treatment
modifications did not have a significant effect on survival outcomes. The impact of ocular

disorders on long-term mortality may be related to common factors for both increased risk
of eye disease and mortality, suggesting systemic rather than local involvement. The clinical
assessment and management in older persons with intermediate to advanced ocular disease
status may present with challenges. Early detection of age-related eye diseases in this
population may prevent deterioration of visual acuity and improve quality of life.
