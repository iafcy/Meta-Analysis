Visual Impairment and Mortality
in Elderly People
J. R. THOMPSON, J. M. GIBSON, C. JAGGER
Summary
By linking together the results from two surveys of elderly people in an English community it has been
possible to consider visual impairment as a possible risk factor for mortality in people aged 75 years and
over. Although minor degrees of visual impairment are associated with an increased mortality rate, blind
people survive better than those with less serious visual impairments. Associations are considered
between visual impairment and other known risk factors for mortality in the elderly. Visual impairment is
shown to be associated with degree of social contact, whether a person lives alone, dementia score,
physical activity score and number of unmet needs.
Introduction acknowledged risk factors for survival in the

It is not possible to make an exact correspondence
between these categories and the registration of the
blind, because the blind register takes account of
both visual acuity and reductions in visual fields.
