Purpose: To determine whether blindness in older people is associated with increased health service use
and mortality.
Design: Retrospective matched cohort study from July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2010.
Participants: A blind cohort 65 years of age and older from a volunteer blind register and a cohort of age-
and gender-matched controls selected randomly from the Western Australian electoral roll.
Methods: Person-levellinkedhospital,emergencydepartment(ED),mentalhealth,anddeathrecordsforthe
blindandcontrolcohortswereused.Generalizedestimatingequationsassuminganegativebinomialdistribution
were used to estimate relative rates of hospital admissions, lengths of stay, and mortality after adjusting for
sociodemographicvariables andcomorbidity. Emergencydepartment andmentalhealthservicevisits also were
quantified.
Main Outcome Measures: Relative rates of hospital admissions, lengths of stay, and mortality, as well as
crude proportions of ED and mental health service visits.
Results: Theblindcohortcomprised1726individualsalongside1726matchedcontrols;39%weremen,and

cohort was admitted to the hospital 11% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6%e17%) more often than the control
cohort. The blind cohort also stayed in the hospital longer than the controls, but this effect varied by age. Blind
participants 65 to 69 years of age spent 88% more days (95% CI, 27%e178%) in the hospital compared with
age-matchedcontrols,whereastherewasnodifferenceinlengthofstaybetweenthecohortsby80yearsofage
(rate ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.97e1.25). A larger proportion of the blind cohort visited a hospital ED and accessed
mental health services compared with the control cohort.
