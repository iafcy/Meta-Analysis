Objective: To examine the relationship between visual acuity and mortality in a Chinese population.
Design: Population-based cohort study.
Participants: Chinese persons in Singapore ages 40 to 79 years at baseline examination.
Methods: TheTanjongPagarStudyinSingaporeexamined1232persons(responserate,71.8%)atthebaseline
examination in 1997 and 1998. Participants had measurements of presenting and best-corrected visual acuity (VA)
usingstandardizedprotocols.MortalitydatawereobtainedfromtheNationalDeathRegistry,whichlinkedsubjects
whohaddiedsincethebaselineexamination.CauseofdeathwasdeterminedfromtheInternationalClassificationof
Diseases9codes.Analysiswasperformedon1225(99.4%)participantswithVAdata.
Main Outcome Measure: All-cause mortality.
Results: By December 31, 2004 (median follow-up, 6.8 years), 126 persons had died. Participants with
presentingVAinthebettereyeworsethan20/40(logarithmoftheminimumangleofresolution[logMAR]score,
0.3) had a significantly higher mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR], 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4–6.3,
adjustingforage,gender,hypertension,diabetes,smoking,heartattack,stroke,andincome)ascomparedwith
participantswithVAof20/20(logMAR,0.0).Associationsweresimilarforbest-correctedVAinthebettereye(HR,
2.7; 95% CI, 1.4–5.5). Among clinic participants with logMAR VA measurements, each 1-line difference in
presenting VA (logMAR gain, 0.10) was associated with a 4-fold increased risk of mortality (HR, 4.4; 95% CI,
1.9–10.2).
Conclusions: InthisChinesepopulationinSingapore,visualimpairmentwasassociatedindependentlywith
