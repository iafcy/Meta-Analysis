VISION IMPAIRMENT PREDICTS FIVE-YEAR MORTALITY*
BYHugh R. Taylor, MD, FRACO, Catherne A. McCarty, PHD, MPH (BY INVITATION), AND Mukesh B. Nanjan, PHD (BY
INVITATION)
ABSTRACT
Purpose: To describe predictors ofmortalityin the 5-yearfollow-up ofthe Melbourne Visual Impairment Project (VIP)
cohort.
MethodIs: The Melbourne VIP was a population-based study ofthe distribution and determinants ofage-related eye
disease in a cluster random sample ofMelbourne residents aged 40 years and older. Baseline examinations were con-
ductedbetween 1992 and 1994. In 1997, 5-year follow-up examinations ofthe original cohort commenced. Causes of
death were obtained from the National Death Index for all reported deaths.
Results: Ofthe original 3,271 participants, 231 (7.1%) were reported to have died in the intervening 5 years. Ofthe
remaining 3,040 participants eligible to return for follow-up examinations, 2,594 (85% ofeligible) did participate, 51
(2%) had moved interstate or overseas, 83 (3%) could not be traced, and 312 (10%) refused to participate. Best cor-
rected visual acuity <6/12 and cortical cataract were associated with a significantly increased risk ofmortality, as were
increasing age, male sex, increased duration ofcigarette smoking, increased duiration ofhypertension, and arthritis.
Conclusions: Even mild visual impairment increases the risk ofdeath more than twofold.
