Purpose: To examine patient survival in age-related maculopathy in a 14-year follow-up study.
Design: Population-based 14-year cohort study.
Participants: Nine hundred forty-six residents, aged 60 to 80 years, living in the Østerbro district of
Copenhagen, Denmark, participated in the first examination conducted from 1986 to 1988. These participants
were followed until death or until May 1, 2002, whichever came first.
Methods: Participants underwent an extensive ophthalmologic examination at Rigshospitalet, the National
University Hospital of Copenhagen. Standardized protocols for physical examination, blood samples, and data
from the National Central Person Register, the National Death Register, and the National Patient Register were
used.
Main Outcome Measures: Mortality and age-related maculopathy.
Results: ByMay1,2002,60.9%(577of946)oftheparticipantsofthebaselinestudycohorthaddied.The
adjusted 14-year cumulative mortality hazard ratio for subjects with early and late age-related maculopathy at
baselinewas1.26(95%confidenceinterval[CI],1.06–1.51).Weidentifiedastrongcorrelationbetweenmortality
and age-related maculopathy among women (relative risk, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.23–2.07) but not among men.
