Abstract
Background: A large-scale prevalence survey of blindness and visual impairment (The Andhra Pradesh Eye
Diseases Study [APEDS1]) was conducted between 1996-2000 on 10,293 individuals of all ages in three rural and
one urban clusters in Andhra Pradesh, Southern India. More than a decade later (June 2009-March 2010), APEDS1
participants in rural clusters were traced (termed APEDS2) to determine ocular risk factors for mortality in this
longitudinal cohort.
Methods and Findings: Mortality hazard ratio (HR) analysis was performed for those aged >30 years at APEDS1,
using Cox proportional hazard regression models to identify associations between ocular exposures and risk of
mortality. Blindness and visual impairment (VI) were defined using Indian definitions. 799/4,188 (19.1%) participants
had died and 308 (7.3%) had migrated. Mortality was higher in males than females (p<0.001). In multivariable
analysis, after adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, body mass index, smoking and education status the
mortality HR was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.5-2.5) for blindness; 1.4 (95% CI: 1.2-1.7) for VI; 1.8 (95% CI: 1.4-2.3) for pure
nuclear cataract, 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1-2.1) for pure cortical cataract; 1.96 (95% CI: 1.6-2.4) for mixed cataract, 2.0 (95%
CI: 1.4-2.9) for history of cataract surgery, and 1.58 (95% CI: 1.3-1.9) for any cataract. When all these factors were
included in the model, the HRs were attenuated, being 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1-2.0) for blindness and 1.2 (95% CI: 0.9-1.5)
for VI. For lens type, the HRs were as follows: pure nuclear cataract, 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3-2.1); pure cortical cataract, 1.5
(95% CI: 1.1-2.1); mixed cataract, 1.8 (95% CI: 1.4-2.2), and history of previous cataract surgery, 1.8 (95% CI:
1.3-2.6).
Conclusions: All types of cataract, history of cataract surgery and VI had an increased risk of mortality that further
suggests that these could be potential markers of ageing.

and obese (BMI ≥ 30) [34,35]. For smoking, participants were
categorized as never smoker, former smoker and current

smoked for a minimum of 1 year. Participants who had never
