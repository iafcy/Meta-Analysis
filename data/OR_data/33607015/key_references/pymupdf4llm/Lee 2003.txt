# ORIGINAL REPORTS: HEALTH DISPARITIES

### DISTANCE VISUAL ACUITY IMPAIRMENT AND SURVIVAL IN AFRICAN AMERICANS AND NON-HISPANIC WHITES


**Background: Regional studies conducted in**
the United States have shown associations between visual impairment and shorter survival
in non-Hispanic Whites.

**Objective: To examine associations between**
visual impairment and mortality in a nationally
representative sample of African Americans
and non-Hispanic Whites residing in the United States.

**Design: Mortality linkage with participants**
from the 1974–1975 National Health and Nutrition Examination Augmentation Survey was
performed by the National Center for Health
Statistics in 1992.

**Subjects: Complete data were available on**
245 African Americans and 2571 non-Hispanic Whites.

**Methods: Uncorrected binocular distance vi-**
sual acuity was assessed using Sloan letter
charts. Usual-corrected visual acuity was then
obtained with participants wearing glasses or
contact lenses, if any. Analytical methods included Cox regression models with adjustment
for sample weights and design effects as well
as age, gender, smoking status, and self-rated
health.

**Results: Multivariate survival analyses found a**
significant interaction between race and visual
impairment status; consequently, race-specific
analyses were performed. There were no significant associations between uncorrected binocular visual acuity impairment (20/50 or
worse) and all-cause mortality or cancer mortality. There was no significant association between impaired uncorrected acuity and cardiovascular disease mortality in African Americans (Hazard Ratio�0.67, 95% CI: 0.35–
1.26), but this association was significant in
non-Hispanic Whites (Hazard Ratio�1.21,
95% CI: 1.01–1.45). In multivariate models,
within race groups, impaired usual-corrected
visual acuity was not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality or mortality
due to cancer or cardiovascular disease.

**Conclusions: Uncorrected and usual-correct-**
ed binocular distance visual impairment is not
associated with all-cause mortality or cancer
mortality. Cardiovascular disease mortality risk
may be slightly higher in non-Hispanic Whites

Center for Health Statistics in 1974–

was used to obtain a nationally representative sample of the civilian non-institutionalized population of the continental United States. Informed consent
was obtained from all participants.[8,9]


Data collection took place in 2 phases. First, participants were administered
a household interview. Next, participants who completed the household interview were scheduled to receive a
comprehensive physical examination at
centrally located examination trailers
where visual acuity was tested. Overall
rates for completing the household interview and the physical examination
were 75% for African Americans and
70% for non-Hispanic Whites.
Race was classified by the interviewer as ‘‘White,’’ ‘‘Black,’’ or ‘‘other’’ and
participants were asked to identify their
country of origin. Those classified as
‘‘other,’’ as well as those who self-identified as being of Hispanic origin, were
excluded from the present analyses. After these exclusions, visual acuity data
were available on 245 African Americans and 2571 non-Hispanic Whites

##### VISUAL ACUITY IMPAIRMENT AND SURVIVAL - Lee et al


A total of 56 African-American and
504 non-Hispanic White deaths were
noted. The corresponding numbers for
CVD were 24 and 243, respectively;
and deaths due to cancer were 13 and
135, respectively. Prior to multivariate
modeling, interactions between visual
impairment and each of the covariates
were examined in hazard models for all
cause mortality, cardiovascular disease
mortality, and cancer mortality. These
models contained visual impairment
and covariates, plus an interaction term
for visual impairment and the covariate
of interest. Evidence of an interaction
between race and uncorrected visual impairment for CVD mortality (P�.08)
was observed. Figure 1 depicts the interaction between race and impaired uncorrected visual acuity. Mortality rates
were similar for African Americans with
and without impaired visual acuity
while mortality rates for non-Hispanic
Whites with impaired visual acuity were
approximately twice as high relative to
non-Hispanic Whites without impaired
visual acuity. Because of this interaction,
all analyses were conducted separately
for African Americans and for non-Hispanic Whites.

9: 390–448), since inadequate numbers
of deaths due to other causes of interest
(eg, diabetes, injuries) prevented classification as a cause-specific mortality.

##### Analysis
Due to the complex sample survey
design, all analyses were completed using the Software for the Statistical Analysis of Correlated Data (SUDAAN)
package to take into account sample
weights and design effects.[14] Cox regression analyses were performed using the
Proc Survival program in SUDAAN.


who were 25 years of age and older at
the time of the survey.

##### Measurement and Definition of Visual Impairment
Two Sloan letter charts, presented at
a distance of 20 feet from participants,
were used to assess binocular distance
acuity.[10] Participants wearing corrective
lenses were instructed to remove them
prior to testing, and those who brought
glasses or contact lenses to the examination were re-tested while wearing
their corrective lenses.
Direct and background lighting was
carefully controlled in the examination
trailers where visual acuity testing took
place. Overall, binocular impairment
was defined as 20/50 or worse. Visual
acuity below this level represents mini

mal impairment and the binocular visual acuity criteria for obtaining a passenger car driver’s license is generally 20/
40 or better in the United States.[11] Results from the data, for subjects tested
while wearing corrective lenses, were
used to categorize an individual’s usualcorrected visual impairment status. Uncorrected results were used to categorize
subjects who forgot to bring their eyewear to the examination or who reported that they did not wear corrective
lenses.

##### Mortality
Participants were tracked in 1982–
1984, 1986, 1987, and in 1992 using a
combination of methods: 1) last known
telephone number and address; 2) proxy
interviews with relatives; 3) hospital and
nursing home records; 4) death certificates retrieved through state vital statistics offices; 5) linkage with national telephone listings; 6) the Health Care Financing Administration enrollment file;
and 7) the National Death Index.[12] Information on an individual’s survival
status and cause-of-death was available
for 89% of the participants who underwent vision testing during 1974–1975.
Underlying cause-of-death was coded
using the International Classification of
Diseases Ninth Revision (ICD-9).[13]

Cause-specific mortality analyses were
limited to cancer (ICD-9: 140–208)
and cardiovascular disease (CVD, ICD

iables: sociodemographic characteristics,
self-rated health, smoking status, and visual impairment status. African-American and non-Hispanic White participants with unknown survival status were
significantly more likely to be younger
than participants with complete followup information. Among non-Hispanic
Whites both female participants and
participants who smoked were more
likely to be lost during follow-up. There
were no significant differences in rates
of either uncorrected or usual-corrected
visual impairment between those lost
during follow-up and those included in
the survival analyses among African
Americans and non-Hispanic Whites.
Table 2 presents the race-specific distribution of age, gender, educational sta

tus, smoking status, self-rated health,
and visual impairment categorized by
race and survival status in 1992. Older
age, male gender, lower educational attainment, poor self-rated health, uncorrected and usual-corrected visual impairment were factors associated with a
decreased risk of survival among African
Americans and non-Hispanic Whites.
There was no association between survival status and smoking status among
African Americans.
Controlling only for the complex
sample survey design, hazard ratios
(HRs) provided in Table 3 indicate a
significant association between impaired
uncorrected visual acuity and decreased
survival in non-Hispanic Whites (HR:
1.83; 95% CI: [1.45, 2.31]), but not in


African Americans (HR: 1.40; [0.63–
3.11]). Controlling simultaneously for
age, gender, smoking status and self-rated health, lowered hazard ratio estimates
in both ethnic groups. After controlling
for these risk factors, there was also no
association between uncorrected visual
impairment and risk of death due to
cancer in either African Americans
(1.67; [0.61–4.55]), or in non-Hispanic
Whites (HR: 1.20; [0.75–1.94]). In African Americans (HR: 0.67; [0.35–
1.26), there was no association between
impaired uncorrected visual acuity and
cardiovascular disease mortality; however, this association was significant in
non-Hispanic Whites (HR: 1.21;

only, HRs provided in Table 4 indicate
a significant association between usualcorrected visual acuity impairment and
survival in non-Hispanic Whites (HR:
1.83; [1.32–2.55]); the estimate of the
hazard ratio for African Americans was
also elevated, but the corresponding
95% CI included one (HR:2.35; [0.87–
6.29]). Further, controlling simultaneously for age, gender, smoking status,
and self-rated health, lowered hazard ratio estimates for both non-Hispanic
Whites (HR: 1.21; [0.80–1.84]) and
African Americans (HR: 1.75; [0.66–
4.64]). Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for cancer mortality were slightly elevated in non-Hispanic Whites and African Americans, but both 95% CIs in

cluded one (HR: 1.35; [0.44–4.11];
1.43 [0.11–17.86]). Finally, estimates of
adjusted hazard ratios for cardiovascular
disease were slightly elevated in nonHispanic Whites, but not in African
Americans; these multivariate point estimates were not statistically significant.

#### DISCUSSION


In contrast to most studies conducted in the United States,[1,3,7] Europe,[15,16]

and Australia,[17,18] we found little evidence to support the hypothesis that
uncorrected and usual-corrected binocular distance visual acuity impairment is
associated with mortality risk in African


Americans or in non-Hispanic Whites.
After controlling for age and gender, visually impaired non-Hispanic Whites
had only a slightly higher risk of mortality relative to their counterparts without uncorrected visual impairment
(HR�1.16; 95% CI [1.02–1.33]). In
the Beaver Dam Eye Study, visual impairment greater than 20/40 was significantly associated with mortality
(HR�1.57; 95% CI [1.18–2.08]) after
controlling for the same risk factors.[3] In
the Blue Mountains Eye Study, visual
impairment (�20/40) remained a significant predictor of mortality after multivariate control for age, gender, self-rated health, smoking status, selected
chronic conditions, body mass index,
and alcohol intake (HR�1.7; 95% CI

[1.2–2.3]).[18]

Comparison of findings from the
Beaver Dam Eye and the Blue Mountains Eye Study with the present results
is limited by differences in follow-up periods and the age distributions of the
cohorts. Additionally, one important
difference in visual acuity assessment between these surveys was that uncorrected and usual-corrected visual acuity was
assessed in the NHANES I while the
Beaver Dam Eye Study and the Blue
Mountains Eye Study assessed best-corrected visual acuity. Uncorrected visual
acuity captures elements of any impairment due to underlying eye disease as
well as impairment due to refractive error. On the other hand, usual-corrected
(ie, presenting) visual acuity captures
these elements, as well as access to ophthalmic care and the willingness to wear
corrective lenses. In contrast, best-corrected visual acuity assessment generally
eliminates the contribution that refractive error makes toward poor visual acuity. Utilizing best-corrected visual acuity
may, therefore, better capture the impact of eye diseases such as retinopathy,
glaucoma, and cataract, which have
been shown to be associated with reduced survival in population-based
studies conducted in the United States
and elsewhere.[1,2,4,6,7,18–21]

Results from the Blue Mountains
Eye Study provide only limited support
for the notion that the use of best-corrected distance visual acuity impairment
leads to results in stronger associations
with survival status than the use of usual-corrected impairment measures. As
indicated above, best-corrected visual
impairment was significantly associated
with mortality (HR�1.7; 95% CI:

[1.2–2.3]); however, analysis using usual-corrected visual acuity resulted in a
slightly lower, but statistically significant
mortality risk estimate (HR�1.5; 95%
CI: [1.2–1.9]). Since this is the only
mortality study to present risk estimates
using both visual impairment assessment approaches, it is recommended
that future investigators also complete
mortality analyses using both methods.
Having additional information on the
predictive value of usual-corrected visual
acuity will be useful for gerontologists
and other investigators who wish to use
a visual assessment protocol, but cannot
bring participants into a clinic for testing.
We repeated our analyses using a definition of impairment of 20/80 or worse
to determine if a more severe form of
impairment would be a stronger predictor of mortality. These results are not
reported since associations between visual impairment and survival did not
change appreciably from those reported

in Tables 3 and 4. The relatively few
NHANES I Augmentation Survey participants with more severe visual impairment limited this latter analysis. For
example, only 7% of African-American
participants and 14% of non-Hispanic
White participants had an uncorrected
visual acuity of 20/100 or worse.[22] Other studies reported increased mortality
risk when examining more severe vs less
severe levels of impairment.[1,3,7]

It is unclear if eye disease and visual
impairment are independent predictors
of reduced survival or if these conditions
serve as a proxy for poor health.[19] Selfrated health, which is itself a predictor
of reduced survival,[23] was included in
the present multivariate statistical models to address this concern. The addition
of self-rated health, including smoking
status, did little to reduce associations
between visual impairment and mortality beyond adjustment for age and gender (Tables 3 and 4).
This is the first population-based report examining associations between visual impairment and mortality in African Americans. Assessment of potential
interactions identified a significant interaction between race and uncorrected
visual impairment when examining cardiovascular disease mortality. This interaction is evident upon inspection of Table 3. After control for all co-variates,
there was a slight, but significant increased risk of CVD mortality in nonHispanic Whites, while for African
Americans there was a lower, but statistically non-significant reduction in
CVD risk among African Americans.
The reasons for this finding are unclear.
Notably, African Americans are at increased risk of CVD relative to nonHispanic Whites. Additionally, the prevalence of risk factors for CVD differs
between African Americans and nonHispanic Whites.[24] Responses to the
treatment of CVD and CVD risk factors also vary in these 2 groups.[25,26] Finally, the macro-level influences of racism[27,28] and race-specific variations in
cardiovascular care[29,30] may also explain,


perhaps in part, this CVD mortality differential. Given these factors it is reasonable to hypothesize that visual impairment is not an important risk factor
for CVD mortality in African Americans.
Additional research into the association between visual impairment and
mortality in African Americans is needed, given the small number of African
Americans included in the present analysis and the resulting low statistical
power. For example, for all-cause mortality, at the 5% level, the statistical
power is only 24% for uncorrected visual impairment and 56% for usual corrected visual impairment. There was
some evidence of an increased risk of
cancer mortality among visually impaired African Americans but not
among non-Hispanic Whites; however,
these analyses for African Americans
were based on only 13 cancer deaths
and all 95% CI included one.
In the Framingham Eye study, after
controlling for age and gender, participants with diabetes who had lens changes indicative of cataracts (eg, opacities,
aphakia) were 4 times more likely to die
of cancer compared to participants with
diabetes who did not have similar lens
changes.[5] However, no association between lens changes and cancer mortality
risk was reported for participants without diabetes in the study. In the Salisbury Eye Evaluation Project,[6] the presence of mixed nuclear opacities was also
associated with cancer mortality, even
after controlling for age, gender, smoking status, body mass index, and comorbid conditions (OR 2.85; 95% CI

[1.14–7.01]). It is unclear what biological mechanism could explain a possible
association between eye disease, visual
impairment, and cancer mortality risk.
Nevertheless, additional studies with
sufficient statistical power are needed to
determine if there is a relationship between eye conditions and cancer mortality risk and whether the strength of
this association is stronger in African
Americans than in non-Hispanic
Whites.


Finally, results could be biased due
to loss during follow-up. Participants
with unavailable survival status were significantly more likely to be younger, female and to report being a smoker at
baseline relative to participants with
available survival status. The percentage
of participants with visual impairment,
however, did not differ significantly between those with vs those without available information on survival status. In
addition the percentage of participants
who were lost during follow-up was
modest for African Americans (16.3%)
and for non-Hispanic Whites (10.5%).
Nevertheless we conducted a sensitivity
analysis by calculating HRs for African
Americans and non-Hispanic Whites assuming first that all those lost during
follow-up were deceased and then assuming all those lost during follow-up
were alive. These HRs were similar to
the HRs for survival presented in Table
4. For example, the HR for African
Americans controlling for all covariates
was 0.96 (0.62–1.47); assuming that
participants lost during follow-up were
deceased and then assuming participants
were living led to HRs of 0.88 (0.45–
1.76) and 0.90 (0.40–2.01), respectively.
To summarize, after controlling for
survey design effects plus age, gender,
smoking status, and self-rated health,
there was no association between uncorrected and usual-corrected binocular
distance visual acuity impairment and
survival in African Americans and nonHispanic Whites. There is a slight, statistically significant, increased risk of
CVD mortality in visually impaired vs
non-impaired non-Hispanic Whites.
