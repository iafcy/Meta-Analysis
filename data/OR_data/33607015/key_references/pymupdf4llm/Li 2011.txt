**Abstract**

_Purpose: To evaluate the association between visual acuity (VA) and 4-year mortality in an older_
population-based cohort.

_Methods: Five thousand and fifty-seven persons aged 50 to 96 years (91.0% of the eligible popula-_
tion) residents of the Southern Harbin, Heilongjiang Provence, China participated in the study. At
baseline (2006), the main ocular diseases were diagnosed from a basic ocular examination including
presenting and best-corrected VA. Of the 5,057 participants in the baseline survey, those who died
after the study were identified and the death certificate was checked. The physicians in charge of
the health of the village population were asked for the presumed cause of death. The rate of death
was determined in the follow-up survey in 2010. We evaluated the association of visual impairment
(VI) and mortality using multiple logistic regression.
_Results: Between the baseline examination and the censoring cutpoint study, a total of 214 subjects_
(4.2%) were dead. Females with VI were less likely to have died relative to male gender with VI
(P < 0.05). Compared with participants who reported better presenting VA (VA ≥ 20/60), the risk of
mortality was significantly higher for those reporting moderate VI (20/400 ≤ VA < 20/60) (Odds
Ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI],1–4.1) and those reporting severe VI (VA < 20/400)
(OR,3.6; 95% CI, 2.0–6.6). Similar associations were obtained for best-corrected VA in the better eye
(OR, 3.1; 95% CI: 1.5–6.4 and 3.9; 95%CI: 2.1–7.2, respectively).
_Conclusion: In this Chinese population-based cohort we found that visual impairment predicted a_
significantly elevated mortality.


## Introduction

Previous studies have consistently shown an
­association between visual acuity (VA) and increased
mortality in older population.[1–4] Because higher age
is the major risk factor for mortality, the major age

related ocular diseases such as cataract, glaucoma, and
macular degeneration, also are related to increased
mortality if, in a univariate analysis, age and other
confounding factors are not taken into account.[5–10]
In the Beijing Eye Study, a population-based cohort
survey showed that subcapsular posterior cataract
predicted a significantly elevated mortality.[11] Data collected in the National Health Interview Survey from
1986 through 1994 documented an approximate 50%
increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among patients with glaucoma.[12] In contrast,

any association between glaucoma and mortality after
follow-up periods of either 5 or 10 years.[13,14] Retinal
vein occlusions, and visual impairment (VI) may have
increased mortality.[15–1 7]

Nevertheless, most of the studies were focused
only on an individual disease. We aimed to assess the
multivariate relationships between mortality and the
visual impairment in a population-based investigation
of adults aged 50 to 96 years at baseline residing in
China. The study was conducted in rural population
where the lifestyle and environment may be different.
This area was selected for study to represent the typical
environmental region. This area is characterized by a
cold weather (average 4.5°C yearly), lower elevation
(around 200 meters), farming communities, and plains.
This study provides vital epidemiological data on the
relationship between visual impairment and mortality
in this environment.

## Patients and methods

The Southern Harbin Eye Study (SHES) surveyed vision
and eye disease in population aged 50 to 96 years from
a rural area south of Harbin, China. Sampling design
and participant eligibility criteria and methods used to
conduct the study have been previously described.[10,18,19]
Briefly, a county was selected to be the survey location, with approximately 640,000 people living in rural
areas in 2005. The investigation followed the tenets of
the Declaration of Helsinki and the approval of the
Health Department, Heilongjiang Province, China, was
obtained. Verbal consent from subjects was obtained
before examination with the nature of the examination and participant rights explained by the registrars.
People with an eye complaint were referred to the
county hospital for treatment.

### Baseline survey methods

The designated ophthalmologists provided training to
the epidemic prevention doctors at individual Xiang
clinics. Upon training, these Xiang doctors went to
every household in the selected village, recording
everyone 50 years old and over, obtaining basic information, including age, gender, home ownership, and
self-rated health. Participants were asked whether they
had hypertension, diabetes, a heart attack, angina,
stroke, or cancer history. Hypertension was defined
as a self-reported history of physician diagnosis
or subjects who were receiving drug treatment for
hypertension. Diabetes was diagnosed from history
or from an elevated fasting venous blood glucose of
7.0mmol/L (140mg%) or more. Detailed histories of


**Visual Impairment and Mortality** 55

current smoking and alcohol consumption also were
recorded.

### Baseline eye examination and diagnosis of the main ocular diseases

At the time of the first survey in 2006, 21 clusters
were randomly selected units. The selected clusters
ranged in population from 756 to 1,452, with an
estimated 2005 census population of 23,025. Within
the 21 clusters selected for this study, a total of 5,057
individuals aged 50 years and above underwent VA
testing and a basic eye examination out of 5,559 enumerated people resulting in an overall response rate
of 91.0%. We could not examine 502 of the enumerated people, including 325 people who were temporarily unavailable despite repeated visits on the
day of examination and 177 people who refused to
participate. Non-participation and participation did
not differ with regard to age (P > 0.05) or education
(P > 0.05),but a greater proportion of females (52.9%)
among participants compared with non-participants
(33.6%) (P < 0.001).
The clinical eye examinations were conducted
by two different teams, consisting of seven ophthalmologists each. Those physically unable to attend the
examination site were offered the ocular examination
at home.
A logarithmic visual acuity chart (Precision Vision,
LaSalle, IL, USA) was used to measure VA. Visual
acuity was measured for each eye. The smallest line
read with one or no errors at 4 m using 5 tumbling-E
letters in each row was recorded. If no letters from the
chart could be identified, VA was determined by counting fingers, hand movements, light perception, or no
light perception. Refraction error was measured using
an auto refractometer (Topcon Corporation, Model
RM-8000B, Tokyo, Japan), and the appropriate spectacle correction used in determining VA. All subjects
received a basic ocular examination including external appearance of the eye, examination of the anterior
chamber and lens with a slit-lamp biomicroscope, and
examination of the fundus by direct ophthalmoscopy.
Blindness (severe VI) was defined as presenting VA
worse than 20/400. Moderate visual impairment was
defined as presenting VA worse than 20/60 but equal
to or better than 20/400. Unilateral visual impairment
was defined as visual impairment in one eye but 20/60
or better in the other eye.
Cataract blindness was defined as the sum of both
unoperated and operated cataract blind individuals.
Because it is not possible to retrospectively determine
the preoperative status of a patient with cataract, the
following guideline was obeyed: For those operated

on in both eyes, it was assumed that the individual
was an abilaterally cataract blind patient, whereas unilaterally operated on patients were assumed to have
been bilaterally blind at the time of surgery only if the
unoperated on fellow eye was currently blind. VA <
20/400 was used as the definition of blindness in the
cataract blindness burden analyses.
In the baseline survey, cataract was the dominant
cause of bilateral visual impairment (55.4%), blindness (70.4%) and unilateral blindness (46.7%). Corneal
opacity was another leading cause of unilateral (16.4%)
and bilateral (8.2%) blindness. Refractive error and
cataract were the main causes of unilateral (35.9%,
35.7%) visual impairment, followed by AMD (8.4%);
While glaucoma was an important cause of unilateral
(5.7%) and bilateral (5.1%) blindness, but not visual
impairment.

### Assessment of mortality and causes of death

Of the 5,057 participants in the baseline survey, those
who died after the population-based study were identified and the death certificate was checked. The cause
of death was determined by the physicians in charge
of health of the village population. Those who had
moved to the other area after the population-based
study were assessed about the health status and
death for 135 of the 228 participants (59.2%) by direct


telephone contact with the former participants or their
relatives.

### Statistical analyses

We used the presenting and best-corrected VA from
better-seeing eye to define visual impairment. To
evaluate the association of VA and mortality, we
estimated ORs and 95% Cls for all-cause mortality
and sex- specific all-cause mortality using Multiple
logistic regression for stratified presenting VA groups
(VA < 20/400, 20/400 ≤ VA < 20/60, VA ≥ 20/60). Plots
of all-cause mortality curve stratified by group were
generated by the SigmaPlot 11 method. The data
were analyzed by the SPSS 15 software for Windows
(Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Chicago,
IL, USA).

## Results

Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of
the examined subjects are displayed in Table 1. The
subjects age 50 years and older in the selected clusters made up 27.3% of the population, and the mean
age was 60.5 ± 17.5 (range 50–96) years. The average
age of female was 60.4 years versus 60.7 years among
males. Females were less educated than males. Subjects

age 50–59 were more likely to be examined (n = 2,805,
55.5%). In the follow-up visit, 4,964 individuals (98.2%)
were enumerated and 93 individuals were not checked
due to moving away.
During an average 4-year period, cerebrovascular (CVA) events were the most common cause of
death (n = 75; 35.0%), followed by heart disorders
(n = 63; 29.4%), malignancies (n = 41; 19.2%), and
other causes (n = 16; 7.5%) such as nonmalignant lung
diseases (n = 2), diabetes (n = 3), injury (n = 2), liver
(n = 4), and kidney (n = 3) problems. Data on mortality or cause of death were missing for 5 participants
(2.3%). The most frequent causes of presenting VI
in the dead subjects were cataract (40.9%), refractive
error (33.3%), and macular degeneration (16.7%). The
percentile of diabetic retinopathy was only 3.0% in
the dead cases.
Between the baseline examination and the censoring cutpoint study, a total of 214 subjects (4.2%) were
dead. One hundred sixty one deaths among the 4,300
subjects (3.7%) with VA ≥ 20/60 were recorded. Forty
deaths among the 651 subjects (6.1%) with 20/400 ≤
VA < 20/60, and 13 deaths among 106 subjects (12.3%)
with VA < 20/400 were recorded.
All-cause mortality by better-eye presenting VA
is shown in Table 2. Poorer presenting VA categories
were associated strongly with mortality. Persons with
moderate (20/400 ≤ VA < 20/60) and severe (VA <
20/400) reduction in presenting VA had poorer survival compared with persons with better vision (VA ≥
20/60; P < 0.05, OR: 3.6 [95%CI: 2.0–6.6]).
Table 2 also shows results for all-cause mortality by
better-eye best-corrected VA. As compared with participants with best- corrected VA of ≥ 20/60, participants
with moderate and severe reduction had a OR of 3.1
(95%CI: 1.5–6.4) and 3.9 (95%CI:2.1–7.2), respectively
(P < 0.001).
An examination of interactions between covariates
and visual status revealed sex-specific differences in
mortality across categories of presenting VA. Females


**Visual Impairment and Mortality** 57

with better acuity were more likely to have died relative
to male gender with no VI (3.9% vs. 3.6%) (Figure 1);
however, females with presenting VI were less likely to
have died relative to males with VI. There is a significant (P < 0.05) interaction between sex and categories of
presenting VA. Because of this interaction, all mortality
analyses were completed separately among male and
female participants.
Sex-specific data of ORs and corresponding 95%
CIs for death from all-causes mortality are shown in
Table 3. Compared with participants who reported
better presenting VA (VA ≥ 20/60), the risk of mortality was significantly higher for those reporting moderate VI (20/400 ≤ VA < 20/60) and those reporting
severe VI (VA < 20/400), although, in both cases,
these associations were stronger among men than
women. The prevalence of all-cause mortality in

## Discussion

Results of our analyses showed that presenting visual
impairment significantly predicted higher all-cause
mortality in this population- based study of older adults,
among individuals 50 years and older. We showed that
subjects with presenting VA worse than 20/400 had a
3.6-fold higher risk of death as compared with subjects
with better vision (VA ≥ 20/60), independent of other
predictors of mortality. Several mechanisms account
for the associations between VI and mortality. These
mechanisms include the following: (1) adverse treatment effects for eye diseases, (2) exposure to factors
known to increase the risk of these conditions and major
cause-specific deaths, (3) aging, and (4) impaired psychological functioning.[20] Visual impairment is related to
functional disability.[21,22] Loss of independence, need for
community support, and reduced social interaction and
depression.[23] Depression has been reported to predict
cardiovascular mortality.[24] All the results are similar to
findings from other population-based studies that have
been documented (Table 4).
In agreement with previous study,[28] relationships
between categories of VA and mortality were stronger

in men in our study. In this study, the prevalence of
all-cause mortality in male (15.6%) was higher than
that in female gender (10.8%) (P < 0.05). The exact
mechanism is unclear. Basically, women live longer
and have a better chance of development of eye and
other age-related comorbid conditions, whereas men
die earlier in life and are more likely to have fewer
comorbid conditions. Therefore, it is possible that
other variables are more likely to confound a relationship between eye disease and mortality in women than
in men. However, other eye studies,[29,30] have reported
larger mortality risk estimates in female compared
with male gender. A recent study from Atherosclerosis
Risk in Communities showed that retinal arteriolar
narrowing is related to risk of coronary heart disease
in women.[31] Further research is needed to identify the
associations between VI and mortality in male and
female gender.
We chose to use presenting VA because we
hypothesized that a person’s actual acuity would
affect mortality through intervening factors such
as accidents,[32] psychological health,[33] and quality
of life,[34] which may be responsible in part for poor
survival among persons with visual impairment.[35] It
is possible that presenting VA reflects a person’s daily
level of visual comfort. In our study, only 29 participants (2.2%) presented spectacle.[36] The predictive
value of presenting VA for mortality was somewhat

stronger than for best-corrected VA.[27] However, our
results were similar when we used best-corrected VA
and the best-corrected VA was statistically significant
related to mortality.
Although the findings are similar to other studies,
this does not indicate the association between VI and
mortality is independent of urban/rural lifestyle. It
has been proved that diabetes would correlate with
a higher rate of cardiovascular disease and CVA.[37,38]
With respect to the ocular parameter of diabetic retinopathy, the present survey is different from previous
population-based studies such as the Tanjong Pagar
Study, the Beaver Dam Study, and the Beijing Study
in which this disease was correlated with an increased
risk of mortality.[15,16,27,39] There are only three subjects
who died from diabetes in our study and the percentile of diabetic retinopathy was only 3.0% in the dead
cases. Maybe the rural lifestyle and/or ethnic groups
account for the results.
The Southern Harbin Eye Study has many strengths
for investigating the relationship of VA and mortality
including its population-based sample with high participation, long-term follow-up, and use of standardized procedures. Limitations include the likelihood
that some important confounding factors may not
have been controlled for and some associations may be
due to a chance finding. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of the associations may be false. To the
best of our knowledge, no data show an association
between VA and mortality in China. In this study, we
examined the relationship between VA and mortality
in a population-based cohort of rural Chinese adults
aged 50 to 96 years at baseline residing in China.
Based on the observation, we hypothesize that visual
impairment may be an important marker for mortality
in the study. If the hypothesis is confirmed, a longer
duration of follow-up for this population may provide
more precise estimates of these associations.
