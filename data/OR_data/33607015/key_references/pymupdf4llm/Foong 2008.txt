##### Objective: To examine the relationship between visual acuity and mortality in a Chinese population. Design: Population-based cohort study. Participants: Chinese persons in Singapore ages 40 to 79 years at baseline examination. Methods: The Tanjong Pagar Study in Singapore examined 1232 persons (response rate, 71.8%) at the baseline examination in 1997 and 1998. Participants had measurements of presenting and best-corrected visual acuity (VA) using standardized protocols. Mortality data were obtained from the National Death Registry, which linked subjects who had died since the baseline examination. Cause of death was determined from the International Classification of Diseases 9 codes. Analysis was performed on 1225 (99.4%) participants with VA data. Main Outcome Measure: All-cause mortality. Results: By December 31, 2004 (median follow-up, 6.8 years), 126 persons had died. Participants with presenting VA in the better eye worse than 20/40 (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] score, 0.3) had a significantly higher mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR], 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4–6.3, adjusting for age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, heart attack, stroke, and income) as compared with participants with VA of 20/20 (logMAR, 0.0). Associations were similar for best-corrected VA in the better eye (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4–5.5). Among clinic participants with logMAR VA measurements, each 1-line difference in presenting VA (logMAR gain, 0.10) was associated with a 4-fold increased risk of mortality (HR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.9–10.2). Conclusions: In this Chinese population in Singapore, visual impairment was associated independently with an increased risk of mortality.

##### impairment also is an independent marker for mortality. Population-based studies, largely among white persons, have shown that poorer visual acuity (VA) significantly increases the risk of death.[1–9] In the 14-year follow-up of the Beaver Dam Eye Study in Wisconsin, best-corrected VA of 20/40 (logarithm of the minimum angle of reso- lution [logMAR] score, 0.3) or worse was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% confi- dence interval [CI], 1.04–1.48) while controlling for demographic, lifestyle, and various systemic risk factors for mortality.[9]
 To the best of our knowledge, no data show an associa- tion between VA and mortality in Asian populations. In this study, we examined the relationship between VA and mor- tality in a population-based cohort of urban Chinese adults aged 40 to 79 years at baseline residing in Singapore.

### Patients and Methods

#### Study Population and Procedures

The Tanjong Pagar Study was a population-based survey of eye
diseases among Chinese adults living in Singapore conducted

between October, 1997, and August, 1998.[10,11] The study was
approved by the ethics committee of the Singapore National Eye
Center and was carried out in accordance with the tenets of the World
Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants. Detailed population selection and methodology were described previously.[10–16] Briefly, the
names of 2000 Chinese persons aged 40 to 79 years residing in the
Tanjong Pagar district was selected from the 1996 electoral register
(13% of 15 082 names) using a disproportionate (with more weights
given to the older age groups), stratified, clustered, random sampling
procedure. Of the 1717 persons considered eligible to participate,
1090 underwent a comprehensive eye examination at the research
clinic and a further 142 were examined at their homes, bringing the
total number of participants to 1232 (response rate, 71.8%).
This study included participants from both the clinic and home
examinations with VA measurements (n � 1225; 99.4% of 1232).
We also conducted a subanalysis among the 1088 participants
(99.8% of 1090) who attended the research clinic examination,
where VA was measured using logMAR charts at 4 m.

#### Visual Acuity Measurement and Definitions

Visual acuity was measured using standardized procedures previously described. For all examinations conducted at the clinic,
presenting VA was measured using logMAR charts at 4 m with
distance correction, if any.[11] Refractive error was assessed using
an autorefractor, and best-corrected VA was obtained after subjective refraction.[10] LogMAR scores for each eye for both presenting and best-corrected VA were recorded as the last line where
3 letters or more were read correctly, in increments of 0.10.[14] For
home examinations, presenting VA was assessed using a Snellen
chart at 3 m with distance correction, if any. If the reading was less
than 20/40, VA was remeasured using a pinhole to ascertain
best-corrected VA. Refractive error was measured using a handheld autorefractor; subjective refraction was not assessed in home
examinations.
In our main analyses (n � 1225), Snellen readings from home
examinations were converted to equivalent logMAR scores and
were combined with logMAR scores obtained from the clinic
examination. Visual acuity then was categorized into none, mild,
moderate, and severe reduction, corresponding to logMAR
(Snellen) cutoffs of 0.00 (20/20), 0.18 (20/30), 0.30 (20/40), and
more than 0.30 (more than 20/40). In our subanalysis of clinic
participants (n � 1088), VA also was analyzed as a continuous
variable (per 0.10 difference in the logMAR score).
Complete examinations of the anterior segment, fundus, and
optic disc were conducted at the slit lamp using standardized
protocols. Ocular biometry, intraocular pressure, lens opacity
scores using the modified Lens Opacity Classification System III,
as well as blood pressure, height, and weight were recorded.[11–13]
Information on medical history, smoking status, and socioeconomic indicators were obtained using interviewer-administered
standard questionnaires.[10–16]

Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure of 140
mmHg or more, diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more, use
of antihypertensive medication, or a combination thereof.[15] Diabetes was defined as use of diet, oral diabetic medications, insulin
injections, or a combination thereof.[16] Cigarette smoking was
defined as either current or past/never. Heart attack and stroke
were defined from self-report (yes or no). Income was defined as
individual monthly income (no income/retired, Singapore $1–
$1000, $1001–$1500, $1501–$2000, or more than $2000).
Definitions of various ocular condition examined in the
Tanjong Pagar Study, including presence of cataract (nuclear,
cortical, posterior subcapsular), glaucoma, refractive errors
(myopia, hypermetropia, astigmatism, anisometropia), under

corrected refractive error, and pterygium, were described previously.[10 –14]

#### Mortality Data

The unique national registration identity card numbers, together
with date of birth and gender, of the 1232 members of the original
cohort were matched with mortality records maintained by the
National Registry of Births and Deaths. Vital status as of December 31, 2004, was determined for 100% of the participants. Information on the date of death and primary cause of death (given on
the death certificate) for the participants were extracted. The underlying cause of death was reported using the International Classification of Diseases 9 codes. Cancer mortality was defined according to codes 140.0 to 208.9, ischemic heart disease was
defined according to codes 410.0 to 414.9, cerebrovascular disease
was defined according to mortality codes 430.0 to 438.9, and
pneumonia, influenza, bronchitis, asthma were defined according
to codes 480.0 to 493.9. Previous studies using this system of
identifying deaths and using International Classification of Diseases 9 codes have been reported in Singapore.[17]

#### Statistical Analysis

Person-days were calculated for each participant from the date of
individual examinations where VA was measured through December 31, 2004. We used presenting and best-corrected VA data from
the better eye for this study. Analyses using data from the right or
left eye produced largely similar results (data not shown).
To determine the association of VA and mortality, we estimated
HRs and 95% CIs for all-cause mortality using Cox’s proportional
hazards regression for stratified presenting VA and best-corrected
VA groups (VA�0.00, 0.00�VA�0.18, 0.18�VA�0.30, and
VA�0.30). The proportional hazard assumption was checked by
plotting the log-minus-log plot of the estimated survival functions
against log time. Plots of survival curves stratified by group were
generated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was
used for comparing different groups with respect to their survival
distributions. We constructed 3 models: crude; adjusted for age
and gender; and adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, diabetes,
smoking, heart attack, stroke, and income (multivariable model).
All analyses were performed using SPSS software version 13.0
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).

### Results

Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of participants according to their better-eye presenting VA status. Persons with poorer
presenting VA tended to be females, to have cataract or to have
undergone cataract surgery, and to have undercorrected refractive
error, regardless of age.
By December 31, 2004 (median follow-up, 6.8 years), 126
persons from the baseline cohort had died. After adjusting for age
and gender, systemic correlates of mortality include hypertension
(HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0–3.0), diabetes (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.6–4.0),
smoking (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2–3.0), heart attack (HR, 1.7; 95%
CI, 0.9–3.0), stroke (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.0–4.7), and income (HR,
2.0; 95% CI, 1.2–3.2, comparing retired/no income with income of
Singapore $1–$1000; other income categories were not statistically significant [data not shown]).

Table 2 shows mortality by better-eye presenting VA. In crude
analysis, poorer presenting VA categories were associated strongly
with mortality. Figure 1 shows the age- and gender-adjusted survival curve for presenting VA categories. Persons with mild,

moderate, and severe reduction in presenting VA (presenting VA,
worse than 20/20) had poorer survival compared with persons with
normal vision (presenting VA, 20/20 or better; P�0.001, log-rank
test). The association between presenting VA and mortality was
weakened but remained significant after controlling for age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, heart attack, stroke, and
income. In the final multivariable model, participants with presenting VA in the better eye worse than logMAR 0.3 had an HR of 2.9
(95% CI, 1.4–6.3) as compared with participants with logMAR
VA of 0.0. Associations were largely similar in the subanalysis of
clinic participants, with a corresponding multivariate-adjusted HR of
2.6 (95% CI, 1.2–5.7) comparing logMAR 0.3 versus logMAR 0.0.

Table 3 shows results for better-eye best-corrected VA, and
Figure 2 shows the age- and gender-adjusted survival curve for
best-corrected VA categories (P�0.001, log-rank test). In the final
multivariable model, as compared with participants with bestcorrected logMAR VA of 0.0, participants with VA worse than


logMAR 0.3 had an HR of 2.7 and 2.4, respectively, for all
participants and clinic participants.
Among clinic participants, a 1-line difference in presenting VA
(logMAR increase, 0.10) was associated with a 4-fold increased
risk in mortality (HR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.9–10.2), after adjustment for
independent predictors of mortality, including age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, heart attack, stroke, and income. The
increase in mortality risk was more pronounced for every 1-line
difference in best-corrected VA (HR, 6.8; 95% CI, 1.8–25.9) after
adjustment for the variables (data not shown).
The underlying causes of death varied by presenting VA categories. Persons with VA of 20/20 or better were more likely to die
of cancer, whereas persons with VA worse than 20/40 were more
likely to die of other causes that included diabetes, renal failure,
and injury. However, the number of deaths was too small to detect
any significant pattern in the causes of death by increasing severity
of visual impairment.

error, pterygium, and ocular biometry parameters (axial length and
vitreous chamber depth) with mortality. We did not find significant
associations for any of these conditions (data not shown).

We showed that persons with present- ing VA worse than 20/20 (logMAR, 0.0) had a 3-fold higher risk of death as compared with persons with normal vision (VA, 20/20 or better), independent of other predictors of mortality. The risk of death increased 4-fold for every 1-line decrease of presenting VA. After best correction, persons with VA worse than 20/40 (logMAR, 0.3) also had a higher risk of death after multivariate adjustments. These results are consistent with findings from other population-based studies in Western countries that have documented the relationship of VA and mortality (Table 4).

VA � visual acuity.

##### Most of these studies defined visual impairment by best- corrected VA measurements.[1–4,6,9] We found that the pre- dictive value of presenting VA for mortality was somewhat stronger than for best-corrected VA. It is possible that presenting VA reflects a person’s daily level of visual comfort and may affect mortality through intervening fac- tors such as falls,[18] accidents,[19] depression,[8] and general quality of life.[20] In this respect, we found that the causes of death were different between VA categories, with cancer being the leading cause of death in people with normal vision, and all others being the leading cause of death in people with poorer vision. We had limited numbers to examine specific causes further. We had small numbers of participants with VA poorer than 20/40. In a subsidiary analysis, we did not find an association of bilateral low vision (defined as best-corrected VA in the better eye of 20/60–20/400) or blindness (worse


##### than 20/400)[13] with mortality (data not shown). Thompson et al[1] found similar patterns in their study of the association between visual impairment and mortality, in which visual impairment was associated with increased mortality in per- sons with moderately poor VA but not in those with VA worse than 20/200. The authors suggest that this pattern may reflect that persons with extremely poor vision or blindness generally were better cared for by society than those with moderate visual impairment. Some, but not all, population-based studies have shown that increased mortality risk is associated with cataract,[4,6,21–25] glaucoma,[26] diabetic retinopathy,[9,27] and age-related macular degeneration.[6,28] We did not find a relationship between mor- tality and other ocular conditions measured in the Tanjong Pagar study, including refractive errors, ocular biometry pa- rameters (axial length and vitreous chamber depth), presence of cataract or cataract surgery, glaucoma, and pterygium.

##### Limitations in our study should be discussed. Our study did not have standardized diagnosis for diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, and retinal photo- graphs were not obtained. In addition, the sample size for this study was too small to permit potentially important subgroup analysis, such as mortality risk between men and women. A longer duration of follow-up for this population may provide more precise estimates of these associations. Our study was not designed to address the underlying biologic rationale for the relationship between VA and mortality. Nonetheless, studies of cataract and mortality have postulated that lens changes may reflect cellular pro- cesses associated with aging and accelerated mortality,[9,23] whereas others have indicated that severity of retinopathy serves as a marker of microvascular diseases affecting sys- temic functions in diabetics.[24] However, we did not find an association between lens opacity and mortality. In conclu- sion, we found a strong association of poor presenting and best-corrected VA and mortality in an urban Chinese pop- ulation in Singapore.
