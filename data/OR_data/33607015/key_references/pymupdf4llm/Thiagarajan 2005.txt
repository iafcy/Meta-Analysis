disappeared after adjustment. People with refractive error
remained at small risk, despite adjustment, probably owing to residual confounding from factors associated with
minimal use of eye services rather than underlying eye disease. There were no associations with cancer mortality.

multidimensional screening in people 75 years and older. Full
details of the trial protocol have been published elsewhere.[24] A
total of 106 general practices (family practices) from the United
Kingdom MRC General Practice Research Framework were recruited to the trial. The sampling of practices was stratified by
tertiles of the standardized mortality ratio (mortality experience of a local area relative to the national mortality) and the
Jarman[25] score (a measure of area deprivation) to ensure a representative sample of the mortality experience and deprivation
levels of general practices in the United Kingdom. Practices were
randomized to 2 groups, universal vs targeted screening. In the
universal screening group, all participants were invited to have
a detailed health assessment by a study nurse that included visual acuity. All patients 75 years and older who were registered
with participating general practices were included in the study
unless they resided in a long-stay hospital or psychogeriatric care
facility or were terminally ill. People in sheltered or residential
housing for older persons were included. For the analyses presentedherein,368peoplewithseveredementia,definedasaMiniMental State Examination[26] score less than 12, were excluded
because it was considered possible that their visual acuity measurements might be unreliable.
The baseline assessments were performed between 1995 and
1999. The study was approved by the relevant local research
ethics committees of the participating practices.

**ASSESSMENT OF PARTICIPANTS**

People in the 53 general practices randomly allocated to the universal screening arm of the trial were given a visual acuity test
as part of a detailed health assessment by the study nurse. Visual acuity was measured at 3 m with Glasgow acuity cards,[27]
which measure the minimal angle of resolution on a logarithmic scale (logMAR). Binocular visual acuity was measured first,
followed by visual acuity in the right and left eyes. All visual acuity measurements were conducted with usual spectacle correction. People with visual acuity of 0.5 (20/60 Snellen visual acuity) or more in either eye (equivalent to �6/18 [20/60 Snellen
visual acuity]) were retested with a pinhole occluder. If visual
acuity did not improve to less than 0.5 and the cause of visual
loss had not previously been investigated, the person was referred to an ophthalmologist. If visual acuity improved to less
than 0.5, the patient was advised to see an optometrist. All study
nurses and nurse supervisors (responsible for quality control)
attended a 2-day training session on the study procedures, which
included training by 2 of us (J.R.E. and R.P.L.W.) and practice
sessions in the use of the Glasgow acuity cards. In addition, nurse
supervisors made visits every 3 months to each general practice
during the year the assessment was carried out for quality assurance, including observation of the visual acuity testing.
The detailed assessment also covered a wide range of physical, social, and psychological problems. Potential confounders of any association between visual impairment (and underlying eye problems) and mortality were selected on the basis
of previous findings in the literature, hypothesized associations based on known or postulated risk factors for eye diseases (such as smoking for cataract and AMD), markers of frailty
and aging (such as low body mass index and functional impairments), and social and socioeconomic indicators that might
reflect minimal contact with health services.

**CAUSE OF VISUAL IMPAIRMENT**

All 53 practices taking part in the universal screening arm of the
trial were approached to take part in the study of the cause of visual impairment. Forty-nine general practices agreed to take part.
Full details have been published elsewhere.[28] In brief, a list was
compiled of visually impaired people (defined as having a base

line binocular visual acuity �6/18 [logMAR (logarithm of mini
mumangleresolution)score �0.5]).Amongpeoplewhoachieved
a pinhole visual acuity in either eye of 6/18 or better, the principal reason for visual impairment was refractive error, and furtherinformationonthecauseofvisualimpairmentwasonlysought
for the remaining people who had no pinhole visual acuity or
whose pinhole visual acuity did not improve to better than 6/18.
The study nurse in each general practice was sent a list of people
with visual impairment for their practice. The study nurse abstracted diagnostic information from the general practitioner’s
notes. This diagnostic information was obtained from correspondencebetweenthehospitalophthalmologistandthegeneralpractitioner. The nurse used a form that included the date and source
of correspondence, results of any visual acuity test, diagnosis, and
treatment. The nurse also recorded the name and location of the
last hospital ophthalmologist seen. All correspondence relating
to eye disease was abstracted, including the correspondence resulting from the MRC Trial examination. The forms were returned to one of us (J.R.E.), who coded them twice. A maximum of 3 diagnoses was recorded. The main cause of visual
impairment was considered the cause of visual loss in the eye that
most recently had lost visual acuity. If the main cause of visual
loss was unclear, the 2 main diagnoses were each assumed to contribute equally to the visual loss.
To validate the cause of visual loss obtained from coding
the diagnostic information obtained from the general practitioner’s notes, a 1-page questionnaire was sent to the hospital
ophthalmologist who had last seen the patient. This questionnaire was in the form of a checklist by eye that covered AMD
(exudative and geographic atrophy), cataract (age related, congenital, and other), glaucoma (primary open angle, primary
closed angle, or both), diabetes mellitus (diabetic retinopathy
and other), myopic degeneration, and “other.” The ophthalmologist was asked to rank, if possible, any conditions noted
in order of their contribution to the cause of visual loss. In addition, he or she recorded which eye most recently had lost visual acuity and the visual acuity at the last examination. Agreement between the ophthalmologists and study nurses as to the
cause of visual loss was good (�=0.81).

**MORTALITY OUTCOME**

Most participants (13 561/13 569 [99.9%]) were registered for
mortality follow-up with the United Kingdom government’s Office for National Statistics, which provided factual details and
the cause of death (using International Classification of Dis_eases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] and Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes)._
Analyses presented in this article are based on deaths recorded up to July 31, 2003. Eighty-five percent of deaths were
recorded using ICD-9 codes and 15% by ICD-10 codes. For the
major causes of death examined in this article, there were no
difficulties encountered in combining ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes.

**STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**

Analyses were performed using Stata 8 software,[29] considering
the clustered design of the study (ie, general practice).[30] Poisson regression modeling was performed with all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer mortality rates as the outcomes of
interest. Initially, all-cause mortality rates by level of visual acuity (irrespective of cause) were modeled, with people having a
visual acuity of 6/6 (20/20 Snellen) or better as the baseline reference group. Death rates among people with visual impairment (binocular visual acuity �6/18 not attributable to refractive error) compared with people with visual acuity of 6/6 or
better were then modeled separately for the main causes of visual impairment, including refractive error, AMD, and cataract and other less common causes. Because some people with
a history of cataract extraction may not have been visually im

paired, people with any history of cataract irrespective of their
visual acuity were compared with people with no history of cataract and visual acuity of 6/6 or better.
Age and sex were included as covariates at all stages. Potentialconfoundingfactorswerethefollowing:bodymassindex(lowest fifth), inability (worst fifth) to carry out activities of daily living (washing self, dressing self, cutting toenails, cooking,

illness at baseline (fractured hip, Parkinson disease, cancer, or
depression requiring treatment), history of cardiovascular disease (probable angina on the Rose questionnaire[31] or reported
stroke or heart attack), diabetes mellitus, hypertension (reported or current systolic blood pressure �160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure �90 mm Hg), geriatric depression score

Examination score (categorized as 12-17, 18-23, or 24-30), reported number falls in the previous 6 months (categorized as
0, 1, or �2), hearing problems (failed whispered voice test and
not having a hearing aid), socioeconomic indicators (home
owner, quintiles of the Carstairs deprivation score[33] derived from
postcode linkage to 2001 census variables, and self-reported
financial difficulties), self-reported health (excellent/very good,
good, or fair/poor), low self-reported physical activity levels,
smoking history (never, previous, or current), alcohol intake
(never, previous, below the median, or above the median), and
social isolation (rare contact with relatives and friends or recent bereavement). Testing for interaction by age and sex was
undertaken using the final models obtained.


**RESULTS**


In the 49 general practices taking part in the study, 19 914
eligible persons were invited to have a health assessment, and 14 375 attended, for a response rate of 72.2%.
Among people who responded, 500 had missing data on
visual acuity, and an additional 306 persons scored less
than 12 on the Mini-Mental State Examination, leaving
13 569 persons included in the analyses.
The mean age of participants was 81.1 years; 38.9%
were men. Among 1632 persons (12.0%) who had a baseline binocular visual acuity less than 6/18, visual impairment was attributed to refractive error in 440 (27.0%),
AMD in 479 (29.4%), cataract in 328 (20.1%), and other
causes in 239 (14.6%). (Some participants had more than
1 diagnosis and were counted more than once.) The latter group comprised 64 persons with glaucoma, 29 with
myopic degeneration, 26 with diabetic eye disease, 7 with
vascular occlusion, and the rest with rarer conditions. Data
were unavailable about the cause of visual loss for 285
persons (17.5%) with visual impairment.
**Table 1 gives the distribution of baseline character-**
istics. Compared with persons with normal visual acuity, visually impaired people were older, were more likely
to be female, and had poorer health across several conditions and diseases, including depression and cognitive function (low Mini-Mental State Examination score).
Visually impaired people were more likely to report difficulties in performing activities of daily living, rate their
health as poor, have low levels of physical activity, and
live in areas of higher deprivation, and they were less likely
to be home owners. These patterns were similar across
the disease and condition groups. In age- and sexadjusted analyses, there was a strong association be

tween decreasing visual acuity and increasing mortality
(Table 2). The rate ratios were substantially attenuated after adjustment for confounders, but a small excess risk remained significant for those with a visual acuity worse than 6/9 compared with those with normal visual
acuity (�6/6). In analyses by type of eye problem, increasedrisksofall-causeandcardiovascularmortalitywere
observed for all eye problems, including refractive error
and visual impairment in which the underlying problem could not be ascertained (Table 3 and Table 4).
Adjustment for potential confounding factors markedly
reduced the rate ratios. For example, for all-cause mortality, the excess risk associated with AMD was reduced
from 1.40 in an age- and sex-adjusted model to 1.01 (95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.81-1.25) in a fully adjusted
model. The fully adjusted rate ratio for cataract was 1.04
(95% CI, 0.84-1.28), and for other eye diseases it was 0.90
(95% CI, 0.72-1.12). A small excess risk remained for
those whose cause of visual impairment could not be ascertained (rate ratio, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.02-1.75). Similar
results were seen for cardiovascular mortality, with high
age- and sex-adjusted ratios for different eye diseases much
attenuated after adjustment for the full range of potential confounding factors. However, for those with refractive error and whose cause of visual impairment was unknown, an excess risk persisted after adjustment. There
were no significant associations between type of eye disease and cancer mortality (Table 5). There was little evidence that any of these associations differed by age or
sex. None of the interaction terms was statistically significant by adjusted Wald test, including (age [4 groups]
or sex)� (binocular visual acuity [4 groups] or [refractive error or AMD or cataract or other causes]). Approximately 30% of persons reported having had a cataract.
Comparing persons who had reported a cataract or currently had a cataract vs persons who had not, the fully
adjusted rate ratio was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.90-1.10).


Our study found a strong association between reduced visual acuity and mortality risk, which was markedly attenuated after controlling for a broad range of confounding factors. Previous studies also found an association between
visual impairment and mortality. In the Melbourne Visual
ImpairmentProject,[4] visuallyimpairedpersons(visualacuity �6/12 [�20/40 Snellen]) had a 2-fold increased risk
of death compared with persons not visually impaired (visual acuity �6/12), although only a few potential confounding factors was considered. The results of that study
also suggested that the highest risk was observed in persons with visual acuity ranging from less than 6/12 to 6/18
or better, with decreasing risk below that cutoff for poorer
visual acuity. We found a small increasing mortality risk
across the categories of worsening visual acuity. In common with other investigations, we explored whether the
risk observed for visual impairment was due to the underlying eye disease or problem. In analyses adjusted for age
and sex, we observed strong associations for AMD, cataract, and other ocular diseases with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, but adjustment for confounders removed these associations. In the Rotterdam Study,[22] an

association between AMD and mortality also disappeared
after adjustment for several cardiovascular risk factors, including measures of atherosclerosis and cholesterol.
We found no evidence for an association of cataract
with cancer mortality. In 4 studies[1,8,19,20] among 5 that
reported an association of cataract with mortality that persisted after adjustment for confounding, the association
was not with cardiovascular mortality but with cancer
or other causes of death. Only in the Nurses’ Study was
cataract associated with fatal and nonfatal coronary heart
disease.[21] The associations with cancer and other causes
of death may therefore reflect residual confounding by


other factors related to these causes of death that were
not controlled for in the analysis. It could be argued that
a lack of specificity with cause of death makes an independent and causal association with cataract less plausible. Conversely, if cataract is regarded as one of a broad
spectrum of age-related diseases, including cancer, that
are due to common biological processes such as oxidative stress, associations with a range of causes of death
might be expected. In our study and in the Blue Mountains Eye Study,[1] an increased mortality was observed for
persons with correctable refractive error. We also found
an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality for per

sons with refractive error that persisted after confounder adjustment. It is unlikely that the association of
refractive error with mortality reflects biological aging
but rather that uncorrected refractive error is indicative
of minimal use of optometry services and associated with
characteristics prognostic of death. A recent study[34] in
the United Kingdom reported that 96% of older people


with visually impairing refractive errors had no contact
with eye care services. Although we attempted to control for factors expected to be related to minimal health
service use (such as social isolation and low socioeconomic status), we had no direct information about contact with optometry services and may have inadequately
controlled for this. It is also possible that the associa

tions between cataract and mortality reported in other
studies reflect confounding by factors related to minimal use of health services. Persons with visually impairing unoperated cataracts have been shown to be of lower
socioeconomic status and to have reduced contact with
eye services in several developed countries,[34,35] including the United Kingdom, where cataract surgery is free.
In our study, we were unable to ascertain the cause of
visual impairment in 285 persons. The excess mortality
for this group persisted after adjustment for confounders. This group had a higher mortality than other groups,
suggesting that the reason for nonascertainment of the
cause of visual impairment was linked to poor health. This
was confirmed by analyses that found no excess mortality risk for this group after excluding 10.0% of the population with the shortest follow-up (�1.8 years). We found
no interaction between sex and mortality, in contrast to
a previous United Kingdom study[10] that found a higher
mortality in nondiabetic women but not men. Again, we
suggest that this may reflect factors associated with minimal health service use because a previous report from that
study documented a higher prevalence of untreated visually impairing cataracts in women, with 88% of people
with untreated cataracts having no contact with ophthalmic services.[34]

For example, in the Rotterdam Study,[22] which recruited
subjects 55 years and older, the mean age of participants
with AMD was 82 years, similar to our study. The mean
ages of participants in previous trials have been younger
than in our study, although most included people in the
same age range as ours. It is likely that the prevalence of

5years,[4] 6years,[1] and10years[15] inotherstudies).Theeffect


of comorbidity is most likely to be seen in studies with
shorter follow-up. Conversely, for studies with longer
follow-up, the information on baseline confounders may
not reflect changes in these factors during follow-up and
somayleadtomisclassificationofconfounders.Moststudies with a wider age range would lack power to examine
whethertheresultsvariedaccordingtoage.IntheNurses’
Study[21]ofmorethan60 000women(meanage,53years),
cataract extraction in 2300 women would have had adequate power, but the study did not report the results by
age group. Even in that study, with a much younger age
groupthanours,theeffectsofconfoundingweresubstantial, reducing the risk of mortality from 1.70 in the ageadjusted analyses to 1.37 in the multivariate analyses.
There are several limitations of our study. Other than a
visual acuity test, we did not carry out detailed eye examinations of the trial participants; therefore, we have no information on persons with early lens opacities or agerelated maculopathy that were not associated with visual
impairment (binocular visual acuity �6/18). However, the
literature does not suggest that there is an association of
mortality with early signs of these conditions. In previous
studies,age-relatedmaculopathy,whichincludesearlysigns
such as drusen and pigmentary irregularities, was not associated with mortality even in analyses adjusted only for
age and sex.[1,4,8,22] However, severe nuclear opacities[8,20] and
mixed lens opacities (an indication of severity)[15,19] were associated with poorer survival, while the magnitude of associationwasweakerornonexistentforearlierlenschanges.
We were unable to examine whether there were differences in mortality by type of cataract. Most previously reported associations with mortality have been with mixed
opacities (always including nuclear opacities) or with
nuclearopacitiesalone.Nuclearopacitiesarethemostcommon type of opacities in white populations; therefore, it is
likely that the type of cataract was nuclear in our predominantly white population. We attempted to minimize errors in measuring visual acuity through training the study
nurses, with subsequent quality control. Although an ophthalmologist (R.P.L.W.) was present at the training sessions, we made no formal attempt to examine the inter

misclassification of visual acuity may have occurred. The
fact that we demonstrated a dose-response effect of mortality by visual acuity group (categorized as �6/6, �6/6 to
�6/9 [�20/30 Snellen], �6/9 to �6/18, and �6/18) lends
credibility to the findings. For the classification of ocular
conditions, there was good agreement between the data extracted from the general practitioners’ records and those
of the hospital ophthalmologists, but again some misclassification may exist as to the main causes of visual impairment. It is implausible that any such misclassification of
visual acuity or type of ocular condition would have been
biased by outcome, as mortality was independently ascertained from national data. Any possible effect of misclassification would be to dilute the rate ratios toward the null.
Bias due to misclassification of visual acuity or specific ocular conditions would not affect the findings that most of
the excess risk in mortality associated with visual impairment can be explained by confounding factors. Informationonallpotentialconfoundersincludedinthemodelwas
available for 76.4% of the cohort, but the age- and sexadjusted rate ratios for those with full data and those with
missing data on all confounders were similar.
A strength of our study was the size of the sample, the
informationaboutcause-specificmortality,andthedetailed
dataonhealthandsocialstatus.Thelatterfactorinparticular allowed us to control for confounding more fully than
many other studies. We conclude that the associations reportedforvisualimpairmentwithmortalityorforspecific

association with visual problems or specific eye diseases.
