_ABSTRACT. Background and aims: Our aim was_
_to determine the impact of visual impairment on self-_
_rated health, function and mortality amongst a com-_
_munity-dwelling elderly cohort. Methods: The study_
_design was prospective and longitudinal, subjects_
_being taken from an age-homogeneous, community-_
_dwelling cohort comprising 452 subjects aged 70_
_in 1990 and 839 subjects aged 77 in 1998. Com-_
_prehensive data were collected by structured inter-_
_views and medical examinations carried out during_
_home visits. Data included each subject’s demo-_
_graphic and socio-economic profile, medical history,_
_physical findings, functional status and self-rated_
_health status.Visual acuity was measured using a_
_Snellen chart and visual impairment was defined_
_as best-eye corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or worse_
_on Snellen chart testing._ _Results: Measured and_
_self-reported visual impairment correlated closely,_
_and were significantly more prevalent amongst sub-_
_jects with low education and poor financial status. Vi-_
_sually impaired subjects showed significantly greater_
_dependence in ADL and IADL, poor self-rated_
_health, less ability to rely on friends, increased lone-_
_liness and, in men aged 77, increased visits to the_
_emergency room and hospital admissions. Visual_
_impairment at age 70 significantly predicted poor_
_self-rated health (p=0.029, OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.09-_
_5.10), dependence in ADL (p=0.007, OR 2.91, 95%_
_CI 1.34-6.33), general tiredness (p=0.037, OR 2.40,_
_95% CI 1.06-5.44), and mortality, with a two-and-a-_
_half-fold increase in risk of death at seven years_
_(p=0.0017,OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.48-5.46)._ _Conclu-_
_sions: Visual impairment in the elderly increases the_
_risk of social, functional and medical decline._

residents born between June 1920 and May 1921. Subjects were identified using the Interior Ministry Register for
national elections. At each phase of data collection, subjects
were interviewed and examined, providing information
from sociodemographic, medical, functional and cultural
domains. The Helsinki Committee approved the study
design. The first phase of data collection took place in
1990 and the second in 1998. The only difference in data collection at the second phase was that both interviews and examinations were carried out in the subject’s
home, whereas previously the examinations had been
performed in a hospital ambulatory care setting.
The subjects of the 1990 sample group have been
proved to be representative of the total age stratum of the
Jerusalem population, as shown by identical three-year
mortality and disease specific hospital morbidity (18).
Showing that the sample group was representative of
the total age stratum, enabled the enrolment of additional subjects into the cohort at the second stage of data collection, at age 78. Of the 452 subjects examined at age
70, 70 (15.5%) had died at the time of follow-up, 78
(17.3%) refused to participate, 21 (4.7%) had left
Jerusalem, and a further 22 (4.9%) could not be traced.
Thus, from the 382 surviving subjects, a total of 261
(68.3%) subjects were examined twice, forming the longitudinal group in the study, and 121 (31.7%) subjects were
lost to follow-up. In order to maintain sample size and to
ensure the subsequent phases of longitudinal data collection, a further 578 new subjects of the same age cohort
were enrolled at the second stage of data collection.
Data are presented here from three groups: 1) Crosssectional analysis of 452 subjects aged 70 in 1990; 2)
Cross-sectional analysis of 839 subjects aged 77 in 1998;
and 3) Longitudinal findings from 261 subjects examined
in 1990 and 1998.


_Analysis_
Data storage and analysis were performed using the
SAS package. Cohorts were examined both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Cross-sectional analysis of
each cohort at age 70 (452 subjects) and 77 ( 839 subjects) was performed using Chi-square analysis of variables.
Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed on the
261 subjects for whom data was available from both
phases of the study, to identify the impact of visual impairment over seven years. Odds ratio and confidence intervals were determined. The Log rank test was performed to determine seven-year mortality.

gency Room utilization, hospitalizations, falls in the preceding year, fractures in the prior seven years, and physical activity (as defined as going for a walk at least 4
times a week). Self-rated health was measured in both absolute terms and in relation to others of the same age.
Four Activities of Daily Living (ADL), transfer, dress,
bathing and hygiene in the toilet, were taken from the
Katz scale, whereas the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) were cleaning the home, laundry, cooking,
shopping and telephone use (22). Independence for each
function was determined by direct observation. Comprehensive physical examination was performed including
vital signs, neurologic examination, and cognitive and affective assessement. Dependence in ADL was defined as
requiring assistance from another person in any activity
tested; dependence in IADL was defined as requiring
assistance from another person in more than one of the
activities tested. Depression was identified by the Brief
Symptoms Inventory (23).
Mortality data were obtained from a comprehensive review of all death certificates issued in Israel through the
Ministry of the Interior, and are complete for all subjects
remaining in Israel.

RESULTS
The basic demographic and social characteristics of the
cohorts at ages 70 and 77 according to visual impairment
are listed in Table 1. Visual impairment was significantly
associated with low educational and financial status, at
both ages 70 and 77. Amongst men aged 70, the association with financial status failed to achieve significance.
Visually impaired subjects reported significantly diminished
ability to rely on friends.


There was a close correspondence between measured visual impairment and the complaint that visual
problems disturbed daily life. In subjects with measured
impairment, 61% at age 70 (p=0.004) and 75% at
age 77 (p=0.001) reported difficulty because of visual
problems. In accordance with accepted norms in current
research (24), measured visual impairment alone was
used for data analysis.
The overall prevalence of measured visual impairment at ages 70 and 77 was 23.2% and 16.6% respectively. Of the visually impaired, those with measured impairment between 20/40 up to and including 20/70
formed the majority (76 and 72% at ages 70 and 77 respectively).
The association of decreased visual acuity with other
health variables at ages 70 and 77 is listed in Tables 2 and
3 respectively. Visual impairment was significantly associated with poor absolute and relative self-rated health, and
dependence in ADL and IADL. Visually impaired subjects
reported more fatigue, a finding which achieved statistical
significance in women aged 70.
Visually impaired women aged 70 and men aged 77
felt significantly more lonely. Health service use revealed
that, of the 77-year-old men, visually impaired subjects had
significantly more emergency room visits and hospital admissions. Falls were significantly increased amongst visually
impaired 77-year olds. Although declining function was
found with increased age across most domains, dependence still remained significantly greater in visually impaired subjects.
Diabetes was significantly associated with impaired
vision (with the exception of 70-year-old women), as
was hypertension in 77-year old women.

DISCUSSION
This study clearly shows the widespread impact of visual impairment amongst a population-based cohort of
70-year olds over a follow-up period of 7 years. The
comprehensive nature of the data permitted analysis of numerous variables, including a large number of confounding comorbid factors.
Despite the well-established fact that low self-rated
health is an independent predictor of mortality (25, 26),
extremely few studies have investigated its relationship to
visual impairment. A recent study which addressed this issue (27) was based on an age-heterogeneous group and
lacked longitudinal evaluation. Multivariate analysis failed
directly to include ADL, a factor known to contribute significantly to self-rated health. Visual impairment was
found to be significantly associated with poor self-rated
health only in younger subjects. Our study found two
separate measures of self-rated health to be highly associated with visual impairment at ages 70 and 77, and visual impairment at age 70 turned out to be a significant
prognostic factor for poor self-rated health at age 77. Our
data showed that visual impairment continues to erode
self-rated health with advancing age, a finding to be extended at the next phase of data collection.
Although the prevalence of measured visual impairment
decreased slightly with advancing age, there was an increase in the proportion of self-rated visual impairment in
those with measured visual impairment. The findings
are complementary, since greater mortality amongst visually impaired subjects explains the reduced survival
and lower prevalence over time, whereas the increase in
self-rated visual impairment supports the fact that the impairment does become a greater burden and a more
meaningful barrier with increasing age.
With respect to functional status, the results of our
study strengthen the growing consensus that visual impairment substantially affects the level of function, whether
measured by ADL, IADL, or the need for community support services (4, 9, 13, 27, 28). In our population, visual impairment was significantly associated with functional decline in both ADL and IADL in both age groups.
More importantly, this study confirms the long-term predictive value of visual impairment in identifying subjects at
risk for subsequent functional decline.
Previous studies found a small to moderate impact of
visual impairment on mortality (4, 29), and our results,
which incorporated numerous comorbid factors, confirmed and strengthened these findings. Mild visual impairment at age 70 was associated with significantly increased mortality at age 77, carrying a two-and-a-halffold greater risk of death.
The mechanisms of increased mortality in visually im

paired people are probably both indirect and multifactorial. Perhaps less effective access to health services
is partly due to a decreased social network and support
(9), a six-fold lower likelihood of leaving their homes (1),
increased falls and mishaps (5-8), functional decline
(12, 13) and diminished psychological wellbeing (1416), which all seem to be plausible factors contributing
to a spiral of increasing frailty and vulnerability, themselves the harbingers of illness and death.
There are several limitations to this study. The known
inaccuracy of death certificates, exacerbated by the extremely low number of autopsies performed in Israel,
precluded reliable ascertainment of the cause of death,
thus denying a more detailed insight into specific mechanisms of mortality.
Similarly, the individual causes of visual impairment
were not evaluated, as self-reported data in this area are
imprecise. The definition of visual impairment based upon Snellen chart acuity has traditionally been an accepted standard, although some recent reports have favored more comprehensive tests, such as the visualfunction index (30) and activities of daily vision (31).
These newer tools are themselves being assessed for validity. It should be emphasized that they attempt to
refine rather than replace Snellen acuity, still the cornerstone in assessing visual function.
With regard to the loss to follow-up of subjects from
longitudinal analysis, 121 (31.7%) of surviving subjects
were lost to follow-up. Comparison of baseline characteristics revealed that those subjects who were followed up
were more highly educated and had fewer financial difficulties – a finding common to longitudinal studies. More
importantly, however, there was little difference between
the groups in terms of visual impairment at baseline – visually impaired subjects formed 19 and 24% of those followed up and those lost to follow-up respectively.
Taken together, these results show the far-reaching
negative consequences of even mild visual impairment in the
elderly population, be it on self-related health, functional status or mortality. Far greater awareness of the significance
of visual impairment in geriatric care and improved outreach
services are necessary, aimed at improved detection, diagnosis and correction of visual problems.
