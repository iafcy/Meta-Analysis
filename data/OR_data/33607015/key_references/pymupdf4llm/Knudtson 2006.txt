**Objective: To investigate the relationship of age-related**
maculopathy, cataract, glaucoma, visual impairment, and
diabetic retinopathy to survival during a 14-year period.

**Methods: Persons ranging in age from 43 to 84 years in**
the period from September 15, 1987, to May 4, 1988, participatedinthebaselineexaminationofthepopulation-based
Beaver Dam Eye Study (n=4926). Standardized protocols,
including photography, were used to determine the presenceofoculardisease.Survivalwasfollowedusingstandardized protocols.

a week were considered to have a sedentary lifestyle.
Refraction and measurement of the visual acuity was performed using a modification of the Early Treatment Diabetic RetinopathyStudyprotocol.[28] Visualimpairmentwasdefinedasabest

included eyes that were blind (visual acuity of 20/200 or worse).

weregradedforthepresenceandseverityofnuclearsclerosis.[29]Gradings of severity were assigned on a 5-step scale, and the presence
of nuclear cataract was defined as level 4 or level 5. Anterior and
posteriorretroilluminationphotographsofthelenswereobtained
(NeitzCRT;NeitzInstrumentsCo,Ltd,Tokyo,Japan)andgraded
for the presence and severity of cortical and posterior subcapsular cataracts.[29] A measuring grid was used to divide the retroilluminationphotographsintoacentralcircularareaand8sectorsof
equal size. Cortical cataract was considered to be present if 5% or
more of the lens surface was affected. Posterior subcapsular cataractwasconsideredtobepresentif5%ormoreofthesurfacearea

were obtained of any lesions found outside these fields (eg, diabetic retinopathy lesions).
Grading for ARM was performed in a masked fashion with
use of the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System.[30,31] The system assesses the presence and severity of 14
lesions associated with ARM. More details on these lesions appear elsewhere.[30,31] Individual lesions (eg, large drusen and retinal pigment epithelial depigmentation) were each investigated separately and as a 3-level severity scale of ARM. Persons


with no or small drusen only and no pigment abnormalities were
considered to have no ARM. Persons with signs of geographic
atrophy or exudative macular degeneration (ie, retinal pigment epithelial detachment, subretinal hemorrhage, fibrous scar,
or treatment) were considered to have late ARM. All other persons were considered to have early ARM.

**STATISTICS**

For the ocular conditions, when 2 eyes were discrepant in the
presence of a lesion, the grade assigned for the person was that
ofthemoreseverelyinvolvedeye.Incontrast,weusedthebetterseeing eye to define visual impairment. We used SAS software,
version 9, for all statistical analyses.[34] Simple statistics included
computationofmeans,proportions,and �[2] andunpaired _t_ tests.
Forunivariateanalyses,estimatesofsurvivalwerecomputedwith
the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier. Tests of significance were performed with the log-rank test. Adjustments for
age,sex,andotherriskfactorsweremadeusingCoxproportional
hazards models. Including a squared or cubic term for age was
not significant in the models. Similarly, adjustment for age using 4 age groups in 10-year bands was not as strong a predictor
as using age linearly. Therefore, we determined that using age
linearlywasthemostappropriateageadjustment.Wetestedthe

survival time and the risk factor of interest.[35]
Multivariate adjustment was investigated using several
methods. First, a propensity score was determined for each
of the ocular disease risk factors. The rationale and methods

for using a propensity score are described elsewhere.[36-38] In
brief, logistic regression was used to determine which characteristics were associated with ocular disease without
regard to mortality. The conditional probability of the ocular
disease given the observed covariates was output and stratified into quintiles. Cox proportional hazard models investigating ocular disease and mortality were then fit adjusting
for the propensity score. Second, a stepwise procedure was
used to determine nonocular risk factors for mortality. These
models were further reduced to prevent overadjustment. For
example, glycosylated hemoglobin level and diabetes status
were both significantly associated with mortality. We chose
to adjust for diabetes status only. However, reduced models
were very similar to the models adjusting for all variables
significantly associated with mortality. Some relationships
were stronger in men than women, so analyses were run
separately by sex. Additional stratified analyses were run for
diabetes status and age (using 65 years of age as a cutoff).


**RESULTS**


By December 31, 2002 (median follow-up, 13.2 years), we
confirmed by death certificate that 32% (n=1576) of the
baseline cohort had died. Baseline characteristics of the


population comparing survivors with those who have died
are shown in Table 1. Those who died were more likely
to be older; have higher systolic and lower diastolic blood
pressures, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, higher glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and a higher
pulse rate; consume less alcohol; and have smoked more
pack-years. In addition, those who died were more likely
to be male; to have diabetes, hypertension, a history of cardiovascular disease, cancer, emphysema, gout, arthritis,
gross proteinuria, a sedentary lifestyle, and less education; and to be currently using diuretics and aspirin.
Univariateanalysesforeyediseaseandmortalityshowed
that persons with cortical cataract, posterior subcapsular
cataract,cataractsurgery,glaucoma,visualimpairment,and
more severe levels of nuclear sclerosis, ARM, and diabetic
retinopathy had greater mortality than persons without
(Table 2). After controlling for age and sex, only increasing severity of nuclear sclerosis, cortical cataract, any cataract, diabetic retinopathy, and visual impairment were still
significant (Table 3 and Figure 1).
To further evaluate the relationships of ocular disease
with mortality, we developed multivariate models using

2 different methods. First, a propensity score was calculated for each risk factor and then controlled for in Cox
proportional hazards models. Second, a fully adjusted multivariate model was developed. A total of 27 characteristics of various medical and lifestyle characteristics (listed
in Table 1) were considered, and after an extensive investigation it was determined that the nonocular correlates of
death in the population included age, sex, gross proteinuria, history of cancer, body mass index (BMI), BMI[2], ratio of serum levels of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, pulse rate, diabetes status, history of
cardiovascular disease, sedentary lifestyle, education, and
systolic blood pressure (data not shown). With the exception of nuclear sclerosis severity and diabetic retinopathy,
theresultsweresimilarbetweenthepropensityandthemultivariate models (Table 3). Cortical cataract, any cataract,
andvisualimpairmentwereallsignificantlyassociatedwith
increased mortality after both types of adjustment. Nuclear
sclerosis severity remained significantly associated with increased mortality after adjusting for the propensity score
but was marginally significant in the fully adjusted model.
Diabetic retinopathy severity was marginally significant in
association with mortality after adjusting for the propensity score and was significant in the fully adjusted model.
To evaluate these relationships further, we stratified
analyses by sex, age (�65 vs �65 years), and diabetes
status. When restricted to men only, the significant relationships shown in Table 2 remained significant. When
restricted to women only, the relationships between corticalcataract(multivariate-adjustedhazardratio[HR],1.09;
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.30), any cataract
(multivariate-adjustedHR,1.12;95%CI,0.93-1.34),and

Byusingstandardizedprotocolsfortheexamination,photography, and grading of ocular disease, the Beaver Dam
Eye Study offers a unique opportunity to investigate ocular disease as a marker for mortality. Although a previous
report of mortality in this population[9] included deaths
through November1993(median follow-up, 4years), the
presentanalysisincludedanadditional9to10yearsoffollowup and 1109 additional deaths. We had found that severity of nuclear sclerosis and visual impairment were associatedwithpoorersurvival,butthataftercontrollingformultiplesystemicandlifestylefactors,noneoftheassociations

ofcorticalcataractandseverityofdiabeticretinopathywere
associated with poorer survival in the current analysis.
Relationships between eye disease and mortality were
stronger in men in our study. Women live longer and have
a better chance of development of eye and other agerelated comorbid conditions, whereas men die earlier in
life and are more likely to have fewer comorbid condi

likely to confound a relationship between ocular disease and mortality in women than in men.
Associations between cataract and mortality have been
investigated in many studies.[1,2,4,6,9,13-16,18-21] Nuclear sclerosis or mixed cataract types are more often associated with

**Figure 2. Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) of ocular disease for specific-cause mortality are plotted for any mention of heart**
disease (A), any mention of cancer (B), and any mention of stroke (C). Hazard ratios for heart disease mortality were adjusted by age, sex, body mass index (BMI),
BMI[2], ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, smoking history, pulse, diabetes status, sedentary lifestyle, education, and systolic blood pressure.
Hazard ratios for cancer mortality were adjusted by age, sex, BMI, BMI[2], cholesterol level, smoking history, pulse, and education. Hazard ratios were adjusted for
stroke mortality by age, sex, BMI, BMI[2], proteinuria, systolic blood pressure, and diabetes status. ARM indicates age-related maculopathy. Increasing levels of
severity of nuclear sclerosis, ARM, and diabetic retinopathy are described in the “Procedures and Definitions” subsection of the “Methods” section and in Table 2.

lens proteins may in part be responsible.[40] A level of glycemia below the cut point for overt diabetes may be sufficient to cause glycosylation of lens proteins. The level of
glycemiainthosenotdiagnosedashavingdiabeteshasbeen
shown to be associated with risk of death, usually caused
by cardiovascular factors.[41,42] Also, UV light exposure appears to increase risk of cortical cataract.[43,44] Exposure to
UV light can produce oxidative stress in the eye, resulting

of oxidative stress may be a mechanism for increased systemic morbidity.[45,46] Finally, a genetic component to corticalcataractexists.[47] Geneticfactorsrelatedtocorticalcataract may also be linked to decreased longevity.
Other studies have shown an increased risk among personswhohaveundergonecataractsurgery.[1,13,16] Wedidnot
find this in our study. It could be that persons who have
had cataract surgery are more health conscious and have a
healthier lifestyle than those who did not. For example, in
ourstudypersonswhohadundergonecataractsurgerywere
more likely to be taking vitamin supplements (M.D.K., unpublished data, May 2005). Also, persons who have undergone cataract surgery may have better health care and
may undergo cataract surgery with less severe lens changes
than persons with poorer access to health care services.


Age-related maculopathy was not associated with mortality in the Rotterdam Eye Study[2] or the Blue Mountains Eye Study.[19] However, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study showed an increased mortality risk in persons
with advanced-stage macular degeneration.[4] In addition, a recent study from the Copenhagen Eye Study
showed an increased mortality risk in women but not men
with ARM.[3] Data from our study suggest that there is no
relationship between ARM and mortality. The low prevalence of late ARM or differences in cumulated mortality
rates may explain some differences. We did not expect
to find an association because data from the Beaver Dam
Eye Study have shown that ARM is weakly and inconsistently associated with measures of frailty and not associated with cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer, the main causes of death.[48,49]
Diabetic retinopathy was significantly associated with
mortality. Although our sample size was smaller, these
results are consistent with those found in the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy and other
studies.[8,10,22,23] These data are consistent with the speculation that retinopathy severity may be a marker of similar microvascular disease affecting other organ systems
in persons with diabetes (eg, heart and kidney).
Frailty has been shown to be a strong predictor of mortality.[50] Recent research has suggested that visual acuity is
associatedwithotherfrailtymarkers(eg,handgripstrength
and peak expiratory flow) and in itself may be considered
another measure of frailty.[51] Therefore, it was not surprising that visual impairment was associated with poorer survival in our study. Decreased visual acuity was associated
with mortality in other population-based studies such as
the Blue Mountains Eye Study[19] and the Visual Impairment Project[12] and in the case-control arm of the AgeRelated Eye Disease Study Clinical trial.[4] The visual system is part of the central nervous system. Retinal ganglion
cells decrease in number with increasing age. Therefore,
it is not surprising that decreased vision, as a reflection of
biological aging independent of the specific age-related eye
diseases, is independently associated with mortality.

The Beaver Dam Eye Study has many strengths for investigatingrelationshipsbetweenocularconditionsandmortality,includingthepopulation-baseddesign,largesample
size,long-termfollow-up,useofstandardizedprocedures,
and a moderately high mortality rate of 32%. However, we
