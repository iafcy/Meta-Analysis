## Introduction

There has been inconsistency in the association between
mortality and visual impairment (VI) [1-12] with some studies
demonstrating a positive association [2-4,6-11], whereas others
do not [1,5,12]. Similar findings have been reported for cataract

[1-6,8,10-19], diabetic retinopathy (DR) [6,11,12,16] and age
related macular degeneration (ARMD) [1-3,5,6,8,10-13,16].


These inconsistencies could be explained by differences in
study design, age of the study participants, follow-up intervals,
the definitions used and in the analytical approach to
controlling for potential confounders.
Different biological mechanisms have been proposed for the
association between mortality and certain eye diseases

[20-24]. Possible explanations are that eye diseases such as
cataract are markers of biological aging and that common


-----

ocular conditions may share a common attribute with
conditions associated with increased mortality [20,22]. Another
possible reason is that the excess mortality is a consequence
of VI, which increases the risk of falls and depression,
particularly in the elderly [21].
As there is a paucity of data on the risk of mortality among
those who are blind and visually impaired from India, we
explored this association through a follow-up study of
participants in the Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Study
(APEDS) [25].

## Material and Methods

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
L V Prasad Eye Institute and was conducted adhering to the
Tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was part of a
tracing exercise of a longitudinal cohort (that was studied more
than a decade ago), in order to identify participants who were
available for a reexamination. The causes of death were noted
for participants who had died during this period. Since the
majority of the participants were not literate enough to either
read or sign the consent form, a verbal consent was obtained
in the presence of the village head after explaining the purpose
of this exercise to them. This process was documented in our
study protocol and was further approved by the Ethics
Committee of the L.V. Prasad Eye Institute. For brevity, the
original APEDS survey will be called APEDS1 and the recent
study described here will be APEDS2, which was limited to
individuals aged 30 years or above at the time of APEDS1.

### Methods used in APEDS1

The initial Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Study (APEDS1)
has been described elsewhere [25,26]. Briefly, the study was
conducted in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh (AP)
between 1996 and 2000 in one urban and three rural areas
representative of the population of the State. The principle aim
of APEDS was a) to estimate the prevalence of eye diseases,
blindness and VI, b) to determine risk factors associated with
the major eye diseases, c) to assess the effect of blindness
and VI on quality of life (QoL) and d) to investigate barriers to
the uptake of services. The study sample consisted individuals
of all ages and was selected using stratified random sampling
with probability proportionate to size procedures so that each
social group (caste) was adequately represented in each area.
The sample size (n = 10,293) was calculated to give a precise
estimate of the prevalence of blindness of 0.5% for eye disease
of least prevalence in those aged ≤30 years (ocular trauma)
and >30 years (ARMD). Hence, a sample size of 5000 in each
of these two age groups (≤ 30 years and >30 years) was
chosen such that the estimation of these diseases in their
respective age group would have similar precision. Participants
were recruited from four areas, one urban area (Hyderabad,
n=2,522) and three rural areas, namely Tanuku (West
Godavari district, n=2,503), Mudhole (Adilabad district,
n=2690), and Thoodukurthy (Mahabubnagar district, n=2578).
Interviews, standard eye examinations, and anthropometric
measurements such as blood pressure, weight and height were
undertaken at examination sites set up for the study.


Participants aged more than 15 years were administered a
structured questionnaire by trained interviewers to collect
information on risk factors for eye diseases (e.g. severe
diarrhoea), presence of systemic diseases (e.g. hypertension,
diabetes, leprosy), behaviours (e.g. current or previous
smoking, alcohol consumption, or chewing tobacco) and
regular use of medication (steroids, multivitamins etc). Clinical
examinations were performed by a team comprising four
ophthalmologists and four optometrists who had undergone a
detailed training.
Standard examination included distance and near visual
acuity (VA), both presenting (PVA) and best corrected (BCVA)
after refraction, measured for each eye separately using
logMAR (logarithm of minimum angle of resolution) charts. All
subsequently underwent a full ophthalmic examination
including slit lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundus examination
and lens grading using the Lens Opacities Classification
System (LOCS-III) and the Wilmer classification [27,28].
Participants who were unable to visit the clinic due to physical
ailment or other reasons were examined at home using similar
methods. However, gonioscopy, examination with 78 diopter
lens, automated visual fields, and photography could not be
accomplished in these participants.
Blindness was defined using Indian definitions as PVA less
than 6/60 or central visual field less than 20° in the better eye

[29]. VI was defined as PVA less than 6/18-6/60 or equivalent
visual field loss [30]. The lens was examined after fully dilating
the pupils. Nuclear opacity was graded clinically using the Lens
Opacity and Classification System III (LOCS III) [27] and
cortical and posterior subcapsular cataract were graded using
the Wilmer classification [28]. Because different types of
cataract frequently co-exist, for analysis we considered pure
nuclear, pure cortical, pure posterior subcapsular cataract
(PSC) and mixed type of cataract. Those with total cataract
were grouped under mixed cataract category and those having
undergone cataract surgery (unilateral / bilateral) were treated
as separate group. We defined the presence of pure nuclear
cataract (NC) as at least one eye showing nuclear opalescence
of grade 3.0 or higher on LOCSIII [31]. Pure cortical cataract
(CC) was considered present if at least one eye had a Wilmer
grade of 2 or higher. Pure PSC was considered present if at
least one eye had a Wilmer grade of 1 or higher [31]. Pure
nuclear, cortical or PSC subgroup had isolated cataract without
the presence of other subtypes. Mixed cataract was defined as
at least one eye showing combination of any two type of
opacity and any cataract was defined as having any of the
above mentioned opacity, including history of cataract surgery

[31]. For analysis, the opacity in the most affected eye was
used. ARMD was defined as based on International
Classification and Grading System [32] and DR was defined
based on the modification of the standard classification system

[33].
Hypertension was defined as present if the participant gave a
history of high blood pressure diagnosed by a physician and /
or current treatment with antihypertensive medications and / or
a had a blood pressure reading of ≥140/90 mm Hg. Diabetes
was defined as present if a participant gave a history of
diabetes and / or was taking diabetic medication and / or


-----

diabetic retinopathy was detected on clinical examination. The
duration of diabetes since diagnosis was also documented.
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from the measured
height and weight according to the formula weight (in
kilograms) divided height (in meters) squared. World Health
Organization categories were used i.e. underweight (BMI
<18.5), normal (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25), over weight (25 ≤ BMI < 30),
and obese (BMI ≥ 30) [34,35]. For smoking, participants were
categorized as never smoker, former smoker and current
smoker. Current and former smokers were those who had
smoked for a minimum of 1 year. Participants who had never
smoked, or had smoked for less than 1 year were considered
“never smokers”. Details of smoking used in analysis have
been published elsewhere [31].
The cause of visual loss (VI or blindness) in each eye was
determined and documented by an ophthalmologist in
consultation with the principal investigator. For instance, if
cataract and a posterior-segment lesion of the optic nerve or
retina coexisted and removal of cataract was unlikely to restore
vision, the cause of blindness was attributed to the posteriorsegment lesion. On the other hand, if dense cataract was
present that prevented a clear view of the posterior segment
and with no other signs suggestive of any other cause of visual
loss, the cause of blindness was considered to be cataract. If
index myopia was present due to cataract, and even if the
vision improved with refraction, the cause of blindness was
attributed to cataract as it was the major underlying cause. If
the causes differed between eyes, the cause most amenable to
treatment was selected as the cause of blindness for the
person.

### Methods used in APEDS2

Extensive changes have taken place in urban and semiurban Hyderabad over the last decade, and the original urban
area could not be delineated. Hence, the tracing exercise,
undertaken from 2009-2010 was limited to the rural clusters.
The purpose of tracing the original participants was as follows:

1. To assess the mortality rate amongst those who were
aged 30 years and above at APEDS1 and
2. To determine factors at APEDS1 that predicted
subsequent mortality e.g. lens status, VI, ARMD, after
adjusting for confounders

At APEDS1, 70 out of 94 clusters were included in the rural
sample and 7,771 / 8,832 (88%) of those enumerated were
clinically examined between 1996 and 2000. Of these, 4,188
(53.9%) were adults aged 30 years and above.
Names and addresses of APEDS1 participants were
extracted from the existing database. The field investigators
visited each cluster to gather further information on the APEDS
I participants. Prior to field work, a pilot study was undertaken
during which the instruments were standardized. Following this
training phase, all surviving participants were interviewed in
detail by trained field investigators using standard methods. In
households where the original participant(s) had either died or
migrated, a structured questionnaire was administered by
trained interviewers to the present head of household to collect
information on the cause and/or the reason of death and the


**Figure 1.** **Availability status of participants at the time of**
**APEDS2.**

doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0078002.g001

year of death and migration, as applicable. In situations where
the entire household had migrated, questions were
administered to neighbors. As formal death certificates were
not available, the cause of death was based on verbal autopsy
using WHO recommended methods[36].

### Data Analysis

Data analysis was performed using STATA 11 [37]. For
comparison of two continuous variables, student’s t test was
used, while for multiple groups, one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used. For categorical data, Fisher’s exact test
was used and for analysis of risk factors for mortality and VI,
cataract and ARMD, Cox-proportional hazard model was used

[38]. Test of significance for survival curve was assessed using
the log-rank test. Multi-colinearity between variables was
assessed using variance inflation factors, and proportionality of
the model was tested based on Schoenfeld residuals.
Interaction effects were tested between gender and ocular
parameters (VI, cataract and ARMD), diabetes and different
morphologies of cataract (pure cortical, pure nuclear and
mixed) and VI and cataract (pure nuclear cataract, pure cortical
cataract, mixed cataract and history of cataract surgery).

## Results

The interval between APEDS1 and APEDS2 ranged from
10-12 years (mean 11 years; SD: 0.81 year). Data were
available on all the 4,188 individuals aged 30 years and above
examined in rural clusters during APEDS1: 799 (19.1%) had
died by APEDS2; 308 (7.3%) had migrated and 3,081 (73.6%)
were still living in the area (i.e. they were “available”) (Figure
1). There were 1,964/4188 (46.9%) males in this dataset.
Migration was higher (53.9%) in females than males, and
was higher in one of the rural areas (Mahabubnagar, 11.3%).
There was no significant difference in the mean age of those
available in APEDS2 (mean 45 years; SD: 11.22 years)

risk of mortality compared to those with minimal or no lens
opacities at APEDS1 (Table 2)
To further evaluate associations between ocular and
systemic diseases, demographic and lifestyle factors with
mortality, data were analysed using the Cox proportion hazard
model.
Univariable association of systemic disease, demographics,
lifestyle factors and ocular factors with mortality is shown in
tables 3 and 4.
In the multivariable analysis, four models were considered.
Model 1 included all the VI categories; model 2 included lens
morphology and those who had undergone cataract surgery;
model 3 included any cataract with all the VI categories and
ARMD and model 4 included all the ocular factors (grades of
VI, lens morphology, those who had undergone cataract
surgery and ARMD). All these models were adjusted for
systemic diseases, demographic and lifestyle factors (age,
gender, education level, diabetes, hypertension, BMI and
smoking status; Table 5). The findings were similar in Models
1, 2 and 3 in the univariate analysis, but the hazard ratios
(HRs) were attenuated after adjusting for confounders. In
Model 2, PSC was no longer associated with an increased risk
for mortality (HR=1.00, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.62,

APEDS1 to those in the other studies showed that average
annual mortality rates were similar, being slightly higher in our
study, For example, in BMES, which also had 11 years of
follow up, mortality among those aged 43-84 years in was
28.9% compared to 36.3% in APEDS2. As the data was not
age-standardized, the differences may reflect the varied
demographics differences between samples as well as
differences in life expectancy.
In our study we also found that VI and blindness were
associated with all causes of mortality (Model 1). The
association, though attenuated, held true even after including
other age related eye diseases in the model (model 4). This
association has been reported in previous studies (Table 7)

[2-4,6-11]. The possible explanations could be that 1) visual
acuity is associated with markers of frailty and frailty predicts
mortality[20], 2) there may be common underlying genetic
mechanisms in eye diseases and mortality [22], 3)
environmental exposures may also increase the risk of eye
disease and mortality, and finally, 4) there is some evidence


that low visual acuity itself increases the risk of mortality
through falls, accidents and depression [21,23,24]. A further
explanation is that the findings may be due to residual
confounding, as we were only able to adjust for a limited
number of variables.
Similar to most studies (Table 7; including long term studies
such as BDS, BMES), we found an association between
mortality and nuclear cataract [2,3,5,6,11,14-18,39], cortical
cataract [3,6,11,16,17] and mixed cataract [2,3,6,14,18,19] and
any type of cataract with mortality [2,6,11]. The sample size
was probably too small for PSC to give statistically significant
findings in our study. The association between cataract and
mortality has been reported across studies undertaken in
different geographic locations and ethnic groups, at different
times using different cataract classification systems, which
suggests that biological processes are responsible for both.
Changes inside the lens may reflect molecular [40], cellular and
epigenetic mechanisms, including glycosulation and
denaturation of proteins and oxidative stress that also impact

on systemic health [22]. These mechanisms may be mediated
in part by behavioural and/or environmental exposures such as
cigarette smoking and ultraviolet light, which are risk factors for
nuclear and cortical cataract respectively [41,42]. In India,
severe dehydration has also been shown to be associated with
early onset of cataract [43].


Our finding of increased mortality in individuals who
underwent cataract surgery is not consistently reported in other
studies (Table 7). Some studies have exhibited positive
associations [2,15,44-50] while other were negative

[3-6,8,11,13,18,19]. These differences could be explained by
differences in study design, age at surgery, the degree of lens

opacities at surgery as well as differences in follow-up rates.
Some studies were hospital based rather than population
based, which may bias the findings. In our study, the


association of mortality with cataract surgery (Model 4)
remained consistent even after adjusting for visual acuity.
ARMD was not associated with mortality in our study after
adjusting for confounders, which probably reflects the low


-----

prevalence of the disease in the population and the small
number of cases (Table 7).
The large population based sample and high response rates
are major strengths of our study. A limitation is that change in
exposure status over time was not assessed, but this would
also have reduced the magnitude of the effect. Data on the
causes of mortality also depended on verbal autopsy and many
relatives reported symptoms rather than diseases, which
limited the data on causes of mortality. However, despite these
limitations, our observations are of importance as this is the
first time that such data have been reported from a rural setting
in Asia where life expectancy, access to health care services
and risk factors are very different from the developed nations.
Our findings support the hypothesis that cataract reflect
systemic ageing and that lens may be a useful biomarker of
ageing [22].
