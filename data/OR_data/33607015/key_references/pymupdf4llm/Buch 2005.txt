##### Purpose: To examine patient survival in age-related maculopathy in a 14-year follow-up study. Design: Population-based 14-year cohort study. Participants: Nine hundred forty-six residents, aged 60 to 80 years, living in the Østerbro district of Copenhagen, Denmark, participated in the first examination conducted from 1986 to 1988. These participants were followed until death or until May 1, 2002, whichever came first. Methods: Participants underwent an extensive ophthalmologic examination at Rigshospitalet, the National University Hospital of Copenhagen. Standardized protocols for physical examination, blood samples, and data from the National Central Person Register, the National Death Register, and the National Patient Register were used. Main Outcome Measures: Mortality and age-related maculopathy. Results: By May 1, 2002, 60.9% (577 of 946) of the participants of the baseline study cohort had died. The adjusted 14-year cumulative mortality hazard ratio for subjects with early and late age-related maculopathy at baseline was 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06–1.51). We identified a strong correlation between mortality and age-related maculopathy among women (relative risk, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.23–2.07) but not among men. Conclusions: When adjusting for survival-related factors, age-related maculopathy is a significant risk indicator for poorer survival in women and may be a marker of underlying serious systemic factors or aging processes specific to women.

##### Age-related maculopathy (ARM) is the predominant cause of visual loss in elderly persons in developed countries, including the countries of northern Europe.[1,2] Previous stud- ies have suggested that visually disabled persons have a decreased survival rate.[3–8] However, little attention has been paid to the relationship between ARM and mortali- ty.[3,4,8–12] Limited population-based data are available to assess whether ARM is associated with survival.[3,8,11,12] In

##### the Beaver Dam Study,[3] data were based on a 4-year cu- mulative mortality rate of 9.5% (467 of 4926), 2 Australian studies reported on a 5-year cumulative mortality rate of 7.1% (231 of 3271)[12] and of 16.5% (604 of 3654), respec- tively,[8] whereas the Rotterdam Study[11] reported data based on a 7-year cumulative mortality rate of 21.4% (1359 of 6339). In all 4 studies, the association was not present after adjustment for survival-related factors. However, as previ- ously suggested,[9] mortality may be related to ARM, be- cause ARM may be associated with a major cause of death and thus may be an important marker of underlying comor- bidity of serious extraocular diseases or general frailty. The association with mortality could play a role in cost- effectiveness studies of treatment or prevention of these conditions. Because this study is based on a 14-year cumu- lative mortality rate of 60.99% (577 of 946), it provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between ARM and survival.

### Materials and Methods

The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Copenhagen,
and informed consent was obtained from each participant. The
methods used to identify and describe this population have been
reported previously.[13]

#### Study Population

The Copenhagen City Eye Study is a population-based survey of
vision and common eye diseases in an urban population residing in
the Copenhagen area. The baseline sample consisted of 1000
randomly selected, age- and gender-stratified subjects (age range,
60–80 years) from the Copenhagen City Heart Study Population.
This basis population made up a random sample of 20 000 of
90 000 citizens from the Østerbro district of Copenhagen, with a
response rate of 75%, and has been shown to be representative for
the general Danish population.[14,15] Of the eligible 976 subjects,
946 (96.9%) participated in the baseline eye examination from
1986 through 1988.[13] Of these participants, 577 (60.9%) persons
died during the follow-up period, before May 1, 2002 (Fig 1).
Data on the baseline ARM status were based on available
gradable fundus photographs. Photographic documentation of the
retinal status at baseline was available for 868 persons. Excluding
persons with bilateral confounding lesions, a total of 866 persons
of the 946 (91.5%) participants at the first examination provided
data for the baseline ARM status (823 both eyes, 43 one eye).

#### Procedures

The questionnaire used in the study and the details of the ocular
examination procedures were reported previously.[13] Briefly, a
detailed questionnaire was administered that covered medications
and the medical history of systemic disorders. Pertinent portions of
the detailed eye examination at both visits consisted of taking color
fundus 30° photographs centered on the macula.
Age-related maculopathy was graded according to a modified
version of the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System[16] to assess the presence and severity of lesions associated with
ARM. All questionable and late-stage lesions were assessed in a
blinded fashion by 1 of the authors (NVN).

#### Definitions

The definitions of ARM lesions closely followed the definitions
developed by Klein et al.[17,18] More detailed descriptions of these
lesions are presented elsewhere (unpublished data).[19] _Early ARM_
was defined as the presence in the macular area of either soft
indistinct drusen (�63 �m, decreasing in density from the center
to the periphery with fuzzy edges) or any distinct drusen plus
pigmentary abnormalities (defined as retinal pigment epithelial
depigmentation or increased retinal pigmentation). Late ARM was
defined as the presence of exudative age-related macular degeneration (exudative ARM) or pure geographic atrophy. Exudative
ARM included retinal pigment epithelial detachment, serous detachment of the sensory retina, retinal or subretinal hemorrhage,
subretinal fibrous scars, or all of these. Pure geographic atrophy


was defined by a retinal pigment epithelial atrophic area of 175 �m
or more with visible choroidal vessels, sharp edges, circular shape,
or all of these.
The ARM status was determined for the participants. When 2
eyes of a participant had lesions of different severity, the grade
assigned to the participant was that of the worse eye. Furthermore,
when signs of ARM could not be graded in an eye, the participant
was assigned a score equivalent to that in the other eye.

#### Baseline Variables

Data on baseline best-corrected visual acuity and presence of any
cataract was obtained from the baseline eye examination, and the
methods used have been described previously.[13] Information on
baseline cardiovascular risk factors and disease, alcohol intake,
and socioeconomic status was obtained from the Copenhagen City
Heart Study II and III data files; the procedures used has been
described previously.[14,20] Cardiovascular risk factors were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire and by laboratory tests.
Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure �140 mmHg,
diastolic blood pressure �85 mmHg, use of antihypertensive
drugs, or all of these. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated
as the weight divided by the height squared (kg/m[2]), and obesity
was defined as a BMI of 27 kg/m[2] or more. Self-reported physical
activity during leisure time was classified as sedentary (�2 hours
per week), moderate (2–4 hours per week), and high (5 hours or
more per week). Cardiovascular disease included data on ischemic
heart disease, and stroke was based on a validated self-report by
means of the National Patient Register. Alcohol consumption was
classified according to weekly intake in 2 categories: 250 g/week
or less (�3 drinks per day) and more than 250 g/week, according
to the recommendations of the World Health Organization for
men. Two self-reported socioeconomic status variables were included: educational level (�8 years of education, 8–10 years of
education, and 11 or more years of education) and household
income (low, �7000 Danish crone per month; medium, 7000–
16,000 crone per month [i.e., US $1129–2580], and high, income
� 16,000 crone per month [i.e., � US $2580]).

#### Mortality

Participants were followed from the first eye examination in 1986
to 1988 to the date of death, or May 1, 2002, whichever came first,
using their personal identification number in the National Central
Person Register. Data on the vital statistics of persons with photographic retinal documentation were almost complete (99.8%,
866 of 868).
Information on the causes of death was obtained from the
Danish National Death Register. This information was available
for persons who died before January 1, 2000. The diagnoses are
registered after the World Health Organization’s International
Classification of Diseases, International Classification of Diseases
8 to the end of 1992, and Internation Classification of Diseases 10
from 1993. Data on causes of death were available for the 474
persons with baseline ARM data who died during the follow-up
period before January 1, 2000. Of the 54 deceased persons with no
available information on cause of death, 40.7% (22 of 54) had
early or late ARM at baseline.

#### Statistical Methods

All tabulations and statistical analyses were performed with SAS[21]
and Stata[22] software.
Comparisons of baseline characteristics between surviving participants and deceased persons were done with linear regression
analysis and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test of independence to

adjust for gender and age (divided into 2 age groups; �65 years
and �65 years) with continuous (i.e., blood pressure) and categorical (i.e., ARM) characteristics. The continuous normalized
data variables are presented as the means and standard deviations.
Differences between continuous variables (i.e., mean age differences between participants and nonparticipants) were tested using
_t test analysis of variance. The categorical data were represented_
by frequency distributions. Fisher exact test was used when comparing groups of causes of death.
To assess the independent contribution of ARM, cataract, and
visual loss to death, we used Cox’s proportional hazards regression


analysis, with age as the underlying time axis and delayed entry
accordingly. The use of age as the underlying time scale ensured
optimal adjustment for age in the analysis.[23,24] Relative risks were
calculated as the proportional hazards ratios. Additional covariates
measured at the baseline eye study or at the second or third Copenhagen City Heart Study examination were included as categorical
variables to control for potential confounders: age, gender, smoking
status, alcohol consumption, BMI, total cholesterol level, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, any cataract, and visual
loss (best-corrected visual acuity of �20/40 in the better eye). Test
for trend and interaction was performed in the Cox model.

### Results

During the follow-up period, a total of 577 persons of the 946
participants of the baseline examination died before May 1, 2002,
(Fig 1) resulting in a 14-year cumulative mortality rate of 60.99%.

#### Comparison between Surviving and Deceased Persons

Comparisons between surviving and deceased participants of the
baseline examination at the time of follow-up are presented in
Table 1. The 577 deceased persons were more likely to be older
and male than the 369 survivors. When controlling for age and
gender, the deceased persons by the time of the follow-up study
seemed to have had a highly significant poor prognosis at baseline
compared with persons who were alive at the time of the follow-up
study; that is, they were more likely at baseline to have early, as
well as late, ARM lesions, hypertension, higher systolic blood
pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, a history of smoking,
greater alcohol consumption, fewer years of education completed,
and lower income and level of physical activity compared with
persons who survived.

#### Association between Survival and Age-Related Maculopathy

Table 2 shows the ARM status at baseline associated with mor

tality. Of the 577 persons who died during follow-up, 202 persons
had any ARM (early or late ARM) at entry. Of the 31 subjects with
late ARM at baseline, 27 (87.1%) died, which was significantly
higher than among subjects with no ARM at baseline (58.5%)
(P�0.001).

Table 3 shows the mortality hazard ratios for subjects with
ARM compared with those without ARM at baseline. The hazard
ratios adjusted for age and gender for early or any (early or late)
ARM, respectively, showed an association with mortality (early
ARM, risk ratio [RR], 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09–
1.57, any ARM, RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11–1.57). Late ARM was not
statistically associated with poorer survival (RR, 1.40; 95% CI,
0.94–2.08). However, a test for trend revealed increasing mortality
with increasing severity of ARM (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.08–1.44).
After correction for further confounders (best-corrected visual
acuity �20/40 in the better seeing eye, any cataract, smoking,
alcohol consumption, BMI, total cholesterol level, hypertension,
ischemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus), and, additionally, after correction for significant confounders, the strong association remained unchanged (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.06–1.51). When
repeating the multivariate tests for men and women separately,
ARM was a significant predictor of mortality in women (any ARM

[early or late], RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.23–2.07) but not in men (any
ARM, RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80–1.31). Furthermore, a significant
interaction was found between any ARM and gender (RR, 0.67;
95% CI, 0.47–0.95, P � 0.025), establishing that ARM has a
different impact on mortality between genders in our population.

#### Association between Survival and other Ocular Factors

Of the 577 persons who died during follow-up, 25 had visual loss
(best corrected visual acuity of �20/40 in the better eye), and 210
had cataract (of any type including incipient cataract) at entry. The
presence of visual loss (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.78–1.75) or cataract
(RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.82–1.17) was not associated with a higher
mortality risk when controlling for age and gender. When repeating the tests for men and women separately, neither visual loss
(women, RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.58–2.21, men, RR, 1.18; 95% CI,
0.68–2.04) nor cataract (women, RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.76–1.37,
men, RR, 1,02; 95% CI, 0.80–1.32) was a significant predictor of
mortality.

#### Causes of Death

The causes of death were compared between people with and
without early and late ARM (Table 4). Death from respiratory
conditions that included pulmonary disease caused by cardiac


insufficiency were significantly higher in women with early and
late ARM than in women without ARM at baseline (32% [28 of
87) vs. 19% [20 of 105), P � 0.045). However, women without
ARM at baseline were more likely to have died from ischemic
heart disease or stroke than women with early and late ARM (50%

[52 of 105) vs. 32% [28 of 87), P � 0.019).

### Discussion

##### This study offered a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between ARM and survival. This study had the longest follow-up period and thus the highest cumulative mortality rate published. In addition, the study was per- formed in an elderly population-based cohort in which ARM was assessed carefully with a stringent grading pro- tocol. Moreover, our Danish registration system provided strength to our data collection. This study demonstrated that any ARM (early or late ARM) was highly significantly associated with decreased survival in women but not in men. Women with any ARM at baseline had a 59% higher mortality risk than women

##### without any ARM. No previous study has reported a gender- specific prognostic difference on survival imposed by ARM. All previous studies of the association between sur- vival and ARM have reported relative risks for men and women combined.[3,8,9,11,12] Nevertheless, our results support the newly published results from the Age-Related Eye Dis- ease Study study[9] and the univariate findings of the Rotter- dam Study.[11] However, no previous population-based stud- ies found an association between ARM and survival when correcting for survival-related factors.[3,8,11,12] The reason for the differences among studies is not apparent; however, differences in the length of the follow-up period, the mor- tality rate, the definitions of confounders, and the number of deceased persons between studies may explain some of the discrepancies. Accordingly, the fact that the associations were present in the early and any ARM groups and not in the late ARM group may be explained by the higher power in the large early and any ARM groups compared with the small late ARM group. Our finding of a significant trend of increased mortality with increased ARM severity suggests that ARM may reflect the status of systemic processes associated with aging, being a marker of underlying serious somatic factors or diseases, which could be associated with increased phys- iologic aging and decreased survival in women. The fact that the association was only present among elderly women, of whom only 3 reported on use of postmenopausal exog- enous estrogen substitution at baseline, suggests that low estrogen level may be a possible mediator for the underlying mechanisms. This is supported by previous studies report- ing on women having a greater probability of ARM devel- oping compared with men[25–27] and suggests that some hor- monal factors may play a role in the pathogenesis. In addition, several associations between reproductive factors and a reduced risk of ARM developing have been found,[25,27–29] and estrogen has been suggested to lower the mortality among women.[30–32] The mechanism of these as- sociations is unknown. However, the onset of menopause has been associated with a harmful impact on blood lipids, including lipoprotein (a).[32] These changes place elderly women at a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases[33] and possibly for ARM.[32] This may provide a biologically plau- sible theory of an association of estrogens, ARM, and mortality and may explain the association between ARM and decreased survival in postmenopausal elderly women. However, our finding of an association between ARM and poor survival in women, but not in men, could be due to a number of possible reasons. First, residual confounding must be considered. Age-related maculopathy may be asso- ciated with underlying aging processes or systemic diseases specific to women, which relate to poor survival in women. Inadequate adjustment for age, cataract, and other con- founding factors is likely to be, at least partly, the explana- tion for the association as previously suggested.[8] This is supported by the fact that the prevalence and incidence of ARM is strongly age-related[18,13,34–38] and that cataract, which frequently coexists with ARM,[39] has been associated with poor survival.[3,8,9,40–42] Although cataract was con- trolled for in the multivariate analyses, we may not have controlled entirely for its effect, because the lack of inter

##### vening examinations prevented us from including cases that had cataract develop after the baseline examination but before death. This may explain the lack of an association between poor survival and cataract in our analyses. How- ever, the lack of an association may also be true or caused by cataract having risk factors that also affect mortality, such as age, as previously suggested.[11] Thus, although age and cataract were included in the Cox proportional hazards analysis, their effects may not have been entirely controlled for. Although many factors were included in the multivar- iate models, these may only be markers for underlying etiologic factors causing death. This leaves a possibility for unrecognized confounding not totally controlled for. These possible additional confounding factors remain unex- plained. However, on the basis of Table 1, the person at risk of death in the presence of early or late ARM has hyper- tension, high serum cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, with unhealthy lifestyle habits, and low socioeco- nomic status. Nevertheless, because women without ARM were more likely to die from a cardiovascular disease, which supports a previous lack of association between car- diovascular disease and ARM,[43] these factors may not be cardiovascular. Conversely, because the method used for assigning causes of death is not standardized, it may be prone to misclassification because of lack of autopsy con- clusions in most cases. Thus, care must be taken when drawing conclusions regarding causes of death reported in this study. Accordingly, the fact that women with ARM were significantly more likely to have a respiratory cause of death remains unexplained and might be the result of a type 1 error. Second, possible intervening variables may be of im- portance linking ARM to poor survival in women. Acci- dents,[44] falls, and fractures,[45] functional disability caused by visual loss,[46 – 48] or depression[49,50] have been associ- ated with poor survival and may also be associated with ARM. Our limited data on causes of death did not support accident-related factors to be intervening factors in our population. However, it is likely that older women with visual disability from ARM may be more likely to have depression than older visually impaired men with ARM. Previous findings of an association between visual im- pairment and poor survival[9,3– 8,12,51]suggest that the same intervening pathway could link visual impairment and ARM to poor survival. This postulation is based on the fact that ARM and visual impairment are closely linked, because ARM accounts for the most visual impairment cases having similar impacts on daily living activities. However, we did not observe a relationship between visual loss and mortality, possibly owing to small num- bers. Thus, it is possible that the association between ARM and poor survival is partly attributable to visual impairment resulting from ARM. Third, the association may be spurious, mediated by chance finding only. A future population-based prospective cohort study with a long follow-up period of approximately 15 years will be able to confirm or refute our finding. The recommended sample size for detection of an association between ARM and survival with an � of 0.05 and power of

##### 90%, is approximately 292 persons aged 60 to 80 years at baseline of whom 195 have died at follow-up.[52]
 In conclusion, our data indicate that ARM may be a predictor of poorer survival in women. However, ARM is not likely to be a direct risk factor but rather a marker for underlying extraocular risk factors or diseases that also affect mortality. This possible relationship between ARM and mortality clearly warrants further study.
