**We investigated the relationship of visual impairment (VI) and age-related eye diseases with**
**mortality in a prospective, population-based cohort study of 3,280 Malay adults aged 40–80 years**
**between 2004–2006. Participants underwent a full ophthalmic examination and standardized lens**
**and fundus photographic grading. Visual acuity was measured using logMAR chart. VI was defined**
**as presenting (PVA) and best-corrected (BCVA) visual acuity worse than 0.30 logMAR in the better-**
**seeing eye. Participants were linked with mortality records until 2012. During follow-up (median 7.24**
**years), 398 (12.2%) persons died. In Cox proportional-hazards models adjusting for relevant factors,**
**participants with VI (PVA) had higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio[HR], 1.57; 95% confidence**
**interval[CI], 1.25–1.96) and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality (HR 1.75; 95% CI, 1.24–2.49) than**
**participants without. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) was associated with increased all-cause (HR 1.70;**
**95% CI, 1.25–2.36) and CVD mortality (HR 1.57; 95% CI, 1.05–2.43). Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) was**
**associated with increased CVD mortality (HR 3.14; 95% CI, 1.26–7.73). No significant associations**
**were observed between cataract, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration with mortality. We**
**conclude that persons with VI were more likely to die than persons without. DR and RVO are markers**
**of CVD mortality.**

With aging populations, age–related eye diseases and visual impairment (VI) pose substantial public
health issues[1]. VI can lead to functional disability[2–4], loss of independence[5], reduced social interaction,
depression[6], accidents[7], falls[8] and fractures[9]. In addition, as visual acuity is a reflection of one’s functional
status and ocular health, the presence of VI may also be a marker of frailty and may hence predict mortality[10]. Several population-based studies have shown a possible link between VI with increased mortality[11–19]. However, there have only been few studies in Asian populations[20–22], who have different patterns
of eye diseases, systemic risk profiles, healthcare knowledge and access to care[23].
The presence of age-related eye diseases such as cataract, diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related
macular degeneration (AMD) has also been postulated to be associated with increased mortality
risk[15,18,19,22]. The severity of DR, for example, may reflect systemic vascular risk[24]. AMD shares common

risk factors with mortality and cardiovascular diseases (CVD)[25–31]. Similarly, retinal vein occlusion
(RVO) has been associated with increased vascular risk and mortality[32–34]. However, the relationship
between specific age-related eye diseases with mortality in population-based studies has been mixed.
While some studies have reported associations between cataract[15,18–20,22,35], AMD[15] and DR[18,19,22] with
mortality, others have not found independent relationships[12,16,18,19,22,36]. In addition, only few studies have
been conducted in Asia[20–22] in which AMD and glaucoma, in particular, have different clinical features
and possibly underlying pathogenic mechanisms[37–40].
Age-related eye diseases and VI is likely to increase substantially in Asia in the next few decades[41–43].
In this study, we describe the relationship of VI and major age-related eye diseases with all-cause and
CVD mortality events in a population-based cohort of Asian Malay persons.

### Methods
**Study population.** The Singapore Malay Eye Study is a population-based, cohort study, in which
3280 (response rate 78.7%) urban Malay adults aged 40 to 79 years living in Singapore were examined
between August 2004 and June 2006. Study design and population details have been described elsewhere[44]. A total of 3273 participants were included in this analysis as visual acuity could not be successfully measured in 7 participants. All study procedures were performed in accordance with the tenets of
the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 1989. Written informed consent was obtained from the subjects
and the study was approved by the Singhealth Centralised Institutional Review Board (CIRB approval
number R1107/9/2014). Participants underwent a standardized interview, systemic and ocular examination, and laboratory investigations at baseline.

**Assessment of visual impairment.** Presenting visual acuity (PVA) (with participants wearing their
glasses or contact lenses, if any) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (with subjective refraction
conducted by certified optometrists) were measured using the logMAR number chart (Lighthouse
International) at a distance of 4 m. If no numbers were read at 4 m, the participants were moved to 3, 2,
or 1 m, consecutively. If no numbers were identified, visual acuity was assessed as counting fingers, hand
motions, light perception, or no light perception. BCVA and PVA were used in our analysis, although
PVA is likely to be more relevant in the practical setting as this reflects the “true” visual acuity of the
study population in their daily activities of living. VI was defined as greater than 0.30 logMAR in the
better-seeing eye (US definition)[45].

**Assessment of age-related eye diseases.** Complete ophthalmic examinations of the anterior segment, fundus, and optic discs were conducted at the slit lamp using standardized protocols. Cataracts
were assessed from lens photographs using the Wisconsin Cataract Grading System[46] and defined as
nuclear cataract opacity 4 or greater, cortical cataract 25% or greater, posterior subcapsular cataract 5%
or greater, or previous cataract surgery. Glaucoma was diagnosed and classified using the International
Society Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology scheme based on gonioscopy, optic disc
characteristics, and/or visual fields results[47]. The presence of DR was graded from retinal photographs
according to a modification of the Airlie House classification system as used in the Early Treatment
Diabetic Retinopathy Study[48]. The presence of AMD was graded from retinal photographs according
to the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System[49]. Recent central retinal vein occlusion
(CRVO) was characterized by retinal edema, optic disc hyperemia or edema, scattered superficial and
deep retinal hemorrhages, and venous dilation. Old CRVO was characterized by occluded and sheathed
retinal veins, or vascular anastomosis at the optic disc[50,51]. Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) involved
a more localized area of the retina in the sector of the obstructed venule and was characterized by scattered superficial and deep retinal hemorrhages, venous dilation, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities,
and occluded and sheathed retinal venules[50,51]. The presence of any retinal vein occlusion (RVO) was
defined as presence of CRVO or BRVO.

**Assessment of other risk factors.** Participants underwent a standardized interview for socioeconomic measures (eg, income, education, type of housing), lifestyle risk factors (eg. smoking), medication
use, and self-reported history of systemic diseases. Non-fasting venous blood samples were collected for
analysis of cholesterol and glucose levels. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm
Hg or higher, diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, or use of antihypertensive medication.
Diabetes was defined as a random glucose level of 200 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply
by 0.0555), use of diabetic medication, or a physician’s diagnosis of diabetes. Body Mass Index (BMI)
was defined as body mass (kg) divided by the square of the height (m[2]). History of CVD was ascertained
through self-reporting (yes or no).

**Assessment of mortality.** The unique national registration identity card numbers, together with
date of birth and gender, of the 3273 members of the original cohort were matched with mortality
records maintained by the National Registry of Diseases Office of Singapore (NRDO). Vital status as of
31 December 2012 was determined for all of the participants. Information on the date of death, all-cause
deaths and CVD deaths for the participants were extracted. The underlying cause of death was reported i

**Statistical Analysis.** Time-to-event was calculated for each participant from the date of examination
where visual acuity was measured through December 31, 2012. Cox proportional hazard regression was
used to investigate the associations of PVA, BCVA, age-related eye diseases and mortality. We constructed
2 multivariable models: 1) adjusted for age and gender; and 2) adjusted for age, gender, socio-economic
status, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, BMI and history of CVD. This permits the evaluation of specific
ocular diseases and VI on survival while controlling for other risk factors. Finally, each specific ocular
condition was added to the model to determine its independent effect on mortality. Hazard ratios and
95% confidence intervals (CI) were presented for stratified PVA and BCVA groups. We regard P values of
< 0.05 from 2-sided tests to indicate statistical significance. We further tested the interaction between DR
and VI with mortality by including cross-product interaction term as independent variable (i.e. DR*VI)
in the model. Statistical interactions were deemed significant if the P value for interaction was < 0.1, All
statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 12.

### Results
**Baseline Characteristics.** In total, 3273 participants were included. Of these, 992 (30.3%) met the
definition of VI using PVA and 360 (10.9%) met the definition of VI using BCVA.
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of participants according to their PVA in the better-seeing
eye. Persons with VI tended to be females, have lower socioeconomic status, lower BMI and have a history of CVD, hypertension, diabetes, glaucoma, cataract, retinopathy, AMD, and RVO. Supplementary

to be older, have lower socioeconomic status, lower BMI and have a history of CVD, hypertension, diabetes, cataract and late AMD.

**Visual impairment and mortality.** By December 31, 2012 (median follow-up 7.24 years), 398
(12.2%) persons had died in the SiMES cohort. In Cox proportional-hazards models adjusting for age,
gender, socioeconomic status, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, BMI and history of CVD, participants
with VI (based on PVA) had a higher all-cause mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR], 1.57; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.25–1.96) and CVD-mortality (HR 1.75; 95% CI, 1.24–2.49) than participants without VI
(Table 2). Persons with VI in terms of presenting VA (VA > 0.30) had poorer overall survival (Fig. 1)
and higher CVD-cause mortality, compared with those without (Fig. 2). Similarly, persons with VI in
terms of BCVA had higher all-cause and CVD-cause mortality. The results were similar when the WHO
cut-off for visual impairment (VA < 6/18 in better-seeing eye) was used for presenting and best-corrected
VA (Supplementary Table 2).

**Age-related eye diseases and mortality.** In terms of specific age-related eye disease (Table 3), DR
was associated with increased risk of all-cause (HR 1.70; 95% CI, 1.25–2.36) and CVD (HR 1.57; 95%
CI, 1.05–2.43) mortality. Participants with DR had poorer survival due to all-cause mortality (Fig. 3)

risk of CVD mortality (HR 3.14; 95% CI, 1.26–7.73) but not with all-cause mortality (HR 2.02; 95%CI,
0.91–4.63). None of the other major age-related eye diseases (i.e., cataract, glaucoma and AMD) was
statistically significantly associated with mortality. In the stratified analysis (Supplementary Table 3),
we found that the association between DR and all-cause mortality was stronger in subjects with VI
(p-interaction = 0.035). However, no statistically significant interaction was found with CVD-cause mortality for DR and VI (p-interaction > 0.1).

### Discussion
In this prospective population-based study, persons with VI were more likely to die than persons without
VI, even while controlling for other clinical and socio-economical risk factors for mortality. In particular,
DR and RVO were associated with increased risk of mortality, particularly CVD mortality.
Our finding that VI is associated with higher risk of mortality is consistent with that found in several studies in the Western population (Table 4)[12,15–19] and three in Asian studies[20–22]. As the above
population-based studies span across different ethnicities, it is now highly convincing that VI has a close
linked relationship with mortality. There are some possible explanations to justify this. First, visual acuity
is a reflection of functional status and ocular health. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that
VI leads to functional problems and can contribute to loss of independent mobility[2–5], falls[8], accidents[7]
and psychosocial implications such as depression[6]. These functional problems in turn may contribute to
an increased risk of mortality. Second, VI can also be seen as being a marker of aging[52] and therefore
it is not surprising that with aging comes higher incidence of mortality. Having said that, studies have
not directly proven a causal relationship between VI and mortality, and thus the exact mechanisms for
higher mortality rates associated with VI remain unclear. Our study adds to knowledge of the impact
of VI not only on morbidity but also mortality. Reduction of VI such as cataract surgery may also be
associated with a reduction in risk of mortality. For example, in the BMES, cataract surgery resulting in
the correction of VI resulted in lower long-term mortality risk (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.41–0.73)[53]. Further
studies are essentially needed.
In our study, we also observed that major age-related retinal vascular conditions such as DR and
RVO were associated with CVD mortality, even after adjusting for potential confounders. DR was also
associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality. This positive association of DR with mortality is consistent with other cohort studies[54–56]. The ETDRS study also found that poor visual acuity was associated
with mortality in type 1 diabetics, whereas worsening levels of DR was associated with increasing risk
of mortality[57]. This is in line with the hypothesis that microvascular diseases such as retinopathy may
reflect the macrovascular status in major organs such as the heart and kidney as they may share similar
underlying pathophysiology[58]. The presence of DR has also been associated with other risk factors for
CVD including hypertension and hyperlipidaemia[59]. When we performed interaction analysis, we found
that the association between DR and all-cause mortality was stronger in subjects with VI, indicating
that persons presenting with the coexistence of DR and VI were more likely to have increased risk of
all-cause mortality. This further highlights the importance of prompt management of DR, which can be
sight saving as well as life-saving. Vigilant screening for DR, which can be conveniently achieved in a
non-invasive way by direct visualization of the retinal vessels of the eye, and early diagnosis for RVO
may therefore play an important role in risk stratification of CVD. In the presence of retinopathy, prompt
management of the ocular condition as well as optimization of associated vascular risk factors will be
beneficial in disease control and preserving vision, hence reducing VI, which has also been shown to
increase risk of mortality as above. We did not find an association between glaucoma, AMD, cataract and
increased mortality risk which was similar to the negative findings in many other studies

The strengths of this study include its large sample size, long follow-up and standardized diagnostic
protocols for cataract, AMD, DR, RVO and glaucoma. To our knowledge, this is also the first study
evaluating the association of VI, age-related eye disease and mortality in an Asian Malay population.
Limitations of our study include the possibility of some of the results being due to chance as there are a
large number of confounding factors involved and not all may be accounted for. Further studies are also
needed to investigate if VI has a direct or indirect causal effect on mortality. Longer duration of follow
up may also be useful in confirming these associations. We also did not have data on the time of onset
of cataract and time of surgery, which may confound the relationship between the presence of cataract
and mortality, and whether cataract surgery had an effect on mortality risk.
In conclusion, persons with VI were more likely to die than persons without VI. The presence of DR
and RVO were, in particular, markers of increased mortality and CVD risk.
