#### ABSTRACT. Purpose: To examine the relationship between major ocular diseases and mortality. Methods: The population-based longitudinal study Beijing Eye Study was performed in 2001 and repeated in 2011. The participants underwent a detailed ophthalmic examination at baseline in 2001. Results: Of 4439 subjects examined in 2001, 2695 (60.7%) subjects returned for the follow-up examination in 2011, while 379 (8.5%) subjects were dead and 1365 (30.8%) subjects were alive, however, did not agree to be re-examined. In multivariate regression analysis, mortality was significantly associated with the systemic parameters of older age (p < 0.001; Odds ratio (OR): 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05, 1.09), male gender (p < 0.001; OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.78), lower level of education (p < 0.001; OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.74) and smoking (p < 0.001; OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.36, 2.49) and with the ocular parameters of presence of diabetic retinopathy (p = 0.002; OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.34, 3.81), non-glaucomatous optic nerve damage (p = 0.001; OR: 4.90; 95% CI: 1.90, 12.7) and higher degree of nuclear cataract (p = 0.002; OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.52). In that model, mortality was not significantly (all p > 0.05) associated with refractive error, cortical or subcapsular posterior cataract, intraocular pressure, best corrected visual acuity, visual field defects, prevalence of age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusions, open-angle glau- coma and angle-closure glaucoma. Conclusions: After adjustment for age, gender, level of education and smoking, mortality was significantly higher in subjects with diabetic retinopathy, non- glaucomatous optic nerve damage and nuclear cataract. Other major ophthalmic parameters and disorders such as hyperopia, myopia, high myopia, pterygium, age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, glaucoma and cortical or nuclear cataract were not significantly associated with mortality in the multivariate analysis.

Key words: Beijing Eye Study – cataract – diabetic retinopathy – glaucoma – mortality – retinal

## Introduction

In contrast to disorders of vitally
important organs such as heart or


brain, diseases of small organs like ears
and eyes are not directly related to
sudden death. This does not imply,


however, that ocular diseases are not
associated with an increased mortality
in the long term. Knowledge about a
potential association between eye diseases and increased mortality is essential to forecast life-threatening
conditions and to try to avoid the
development of these. Previous studies
have suggested that patients with glaucoma, subcapsular cataract, retinal
vein occlusions and low vision in general may have an increased mortality
(Borger et al. 2003; Cheung et al. 2007;
Clemons et al. 2004; Cugati et al.
2007a,b; Foong et al. 2008; Freeman
et al. 2005; Hirai et al. 2007; Juutilainen et al. 2007; Klein et al. 1995;
Knudtson et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2002,
2006; McCarty et al. 2001; Mitchell
et al. 2005; Ramrattan et al. 2001;
Thiagarajan et al. 2005; Wang et al.
2001, 2008; Wong et al. 2003, 2007;
Wu et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2007, 2009).
Most of these studies were focused,
however, on one ocular disease only;
other potentially confounding factors
such as socio-economic parameters
were mostly not taken into account,
and the follow-up period was relatively
short. We therefore conducted a population-based study with a 10-year
follow-up on subjects comprehensively
examined for ocular disorders at baseline to assess which ocular diseases may
lead to an increased mortality.

## Methods

The Beijing Eye Study is a populationbased study in Northern China. It was
carried out in four communities in the
urban district of Haidian in the north
of Central Beijing and in three
communities in the village area of Yufa

disease was chosen for the statistical
analysis. Continuous data were presented as mean standard deviation.
�
Logistic regression models were used
to investigate the associations of
mortality with systemic parameters
such as age and level of education,
and ocular parameters such as retinal microvascular abnormalities. All
parameters used in the statistical analysis were assessed at the baseline examination in 2001. In a first step of the
statistical analysis, we assessed associations between mortality and systemic
or ocular parameters after adjusting for
age, as mortality was highly significantly associated with higher age. In a
second step, we carried out a multivariate analysis with mortality as dependent parameter and all parameters as
independent parameters, for which the
p-value of their association with mortality was ≤0.10 after adjusting for age.
We then dropped those variables from
the list of independent parameters
which were no longer significantly
associated with mortality in the multivariate analysis, starting with the variables with the highest p-values. Odds
ratios (OR) were presented, and their
95% confidence intervals (CI) were
described. All p-values were two-sided
and considered statistically significant
when less than 0.05.

## Results

Of the 4439 subjects examined in the
2001, 2695 (60.7%) subjects returned
for the follow-up examination, while
379 (8.5%) subjects were dead and
1365 (30.8%) subjects were alive, however, did not agree to be re-examined.
The prevalence and means of the basic
parameters as measured in 2001 are
presented in Table 1.
Mortality was highly significantly
associated with higher age (p < 0.001;
OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.13). As first
step of the statistical analysis, we
therefore adjusted mortality for age
and searched for associations with
additional parameters. It revealed that
mortality adjusted for age was significantly correlated with the systemic
parameters of male gender
(p < 0.001), lower family income
(p < 0.001), lower level of education
(p < 0.001), rural versus urban region
(p < 0.001) and current or former
smoking (p < 0.001) and with the
ocular parameters of low best corrected


of the Daxing District south of Beijing.
The study has been described in detail
recently (Jonas et al. 2009; Xu et al.
2006; Xu et al. 2008). The Medical
Ethics Committee of the Beijing Tongren Hospital approved the study protocol, and all participants gave
informed consent according to the
Declaration of Helsinki. At the time
of the first survey in the year 2001, the
seven communities had a total population of 5324 individuals aged 40 years
or older. In total, 4439 individuals
(2505 women) participated in the eye
examination corresponding to an overall response rate of 83.4%. The study
was divided into a rural part (1973
subjects; 1143 women) and an urban
part (2466 subjects; 1362 women). The
mean age was 56.2 10.6 years (med�
ian: 56 years; range: 40–101 years). In
the year 2011, the study was repeated
by reinviting all participants from the
survey from 2001 to be re-examined.
Information about being alive or dead
of subjects, who participated in the
baseline survey in 2001 but did not
participate in the follow-up examination in 2011, was obtained by house
visits, by phone, by asking neighbours
and by contacting the local municipal
authorities.
All examinations were carried out in
the communities, either in schoolhouses or in community houses. At
the baseline examination in 2001,
trained research technicians asked the
study participants questions from a
standard questionnaire providing
information on demographic variables
such as age, gender, known diagnosis
and current treatment of arterial hypertension, arterial hypotension, diabetes
mellitus, thyroid disorders, cerebral
haemorrhages, coronary heart diseases
and hyperlipidemia. The socio-economic status was assessed with questions for the level of education,
occupation and family income. The
level of education was categorized into
the stages of ‘illiteracy’, ‘half illiteracy
with knowledge of some Chinese
words’, ‘primary school education’,
‘middle school education’ and ‘college
or higher education’. Individuals were
classified as self-reported non-smokers
or self-reported current smokers.
Uncorrected visual acuity was measured (Snellen charts) in a distance of
5 m. Automatic refractometry (Auto
Refractometer AR-610, Nidek Co.,
Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was performed if


uncorrected visual acuity was lower
than 1.0. Visual field examinations
were performed by frequency-doubling
perimetry using the screening program
C-20-1 (Zeiss-Humphrey, Dublin, California, USA). Intraocular pressure
was measured using a non-contact
pneumotonometer (CT-60 computerized tonometer, Topcon Ltd., Japan).
A slit-lamp examination was carried
out by an ophthalmologist, and the
anterior chamber depth was assessed
using van Herick’s method (Van
Herick et al. 1969). The pupil was
dilated using tropicamide once or
twice, until the pupil diameter was at
least 6 mm. Digital photographs of the
cornea and retro-illuminated photographs of the lens were taken using
the Neitz CT-R camera (Neitz Instruments Co., Tokyo, Japan). Colour
photographs (on film) of the macula
and optic disc were taken using a
fundus camera (Type CR6-45NM,
Canon Inc. USA). Using the findings
obtained during the clinical examination and the results of the assessment of
the photographs, we checked for trachoma, pterygium, nuclear, cortical
and posterior subcapsular cataract,
glaucoma, non-glaucomatous optic
nerve damage, age-related macular
degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusions and any other
haemorrhagic retinopathy (Xu et al.
2009). On the optic disc photographs,
we additionally measured size of the
optic disc, neuroretinal rim, optic cup
and beta zone of parapapillary atrophy
and the diameter of the retinal arteries
and veins in the four vessel branches.
For the evaluation of the retinal microvascular abnormalities, focal narrowing of arterioles, generalized narrowing
of arterioles, sheathing of arterioles
and arteriovenous crossing abnormalities (arteriovenous nicking) were
assessed. The retinal vascular abnormalities including focal narrowing of
arterioles and arteriovenous crossing
abnormalities (arteriovenous nicking)
were assessed using the protocol of the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
Study.
Statistical analysis was performed
using a commercially available statistical software package (SPSS for Windows, version 20.0, IBM-SPSS Inc.
Chicago, IL, USA). Only one eye per
subject was taken for statistical analysis to avoid a statistical bias. The eye

As second step of the statistical

analysis as described above. Step by
step, we dropped from the list of
independent variables the parameters
of generalized vessel narrowing, perimetric score, best corrected visual acuity, prevalence of pterygium, temporal
inferior vein diameter, subcapsular
posterior cataract, disc area, neuroretinal rim area, prevalence of open-angle
glaucoma and prevalence of angle-closure glaucoma. We finally arrived at a
model in which mortality was significantly associated with older age
(p < 0.001), male gender (p < 0.001),
lower level of education (p < 0.001),
former or ever smoking (p < 0.001),
presence of diabetic retinopathy
(p = 0.002), presence of non-glaucomatous optic nerve damage (p = 0.001)
and higher degree of nuclear cataract
(p = 0.002).

## Discussion

In our 10-year population-based follow-up study, mortality was significantly associated with the presence of
diabetic retinopathy, presence of nonglaucomatous optic nerve damage and
more pronounced nuclear cataract
after adjusting for the systemic parameters of older age, male gender, lower
level of education and smoking. In this
multivariate model, mortality was not
significantly (all p > 0.05) associated
with other major ophthalmic parameters and disorders such as hyperopia,
myopia, high myopia, pterygium, agerelated macular degeneration, retinal
vein occlusion, glaucoma and cortical
or subcapsular posterior cataract.
With respect to the systemic factors
of age, male gender, smoking and
lower socio-economic status as measured by the level of education, the
findings of our study confirm previous
investigations in which these systemic
parameters were significantly associated with mortality. With respect to
diabetic retinopathy, our study confirms previous population-based studies such as the Blue Mountains Eye
Study and the Beaver Dam Study on
other ethnic groups in which diabetic
retinopathy was correlated with an


increased risk of mortality (Cugati
et al. 2007a).
A factor added to the list of ocular
factors associated with mortality was
the presence of non-glaucomatous
optic nerve damage. In the multivariate
analysis, subjects with non-glaucomatous optic nerve damage had a higher
mortality than those with a healthy
appearance of the optic nerve head on
the optic disc photographs. Reason for
the association may be the various
causes for non-glaucomatous optic
nerve atrophy such as retinal microinfarcts in the retinal nerve fibre layer,
temporary retinal arterial occlusions
and neurological disorders. It may
indicate that clinically the ophthalmoscopic visibility of the retinal nerve
fibre layer, the thickness of the retinal
nerve fibre layer as measured by optical
coherence tomography and the pallor
of the neuroretinal in the optic nerve
head may be taken as hints for the
general condition of the subject.
The results of our 10-year follow-up
study mostly agree with the findings
obtained in the previous 5-year followup study of the Beijing Eye Study 2001/
2006 with respect to the association
between an increased mortality and the
presence of diabetic retinopathy and of
non-glaucomatous optic nerve damage.
In previous hospital-based studies and
investigations with a shorter follow-up,
it has remained unclear so far whether
the presence of open-angle glaucoma is
a risk factor for mortality. In our study
population, after adjusting for age, the
presence open-angle glaucoma was significantly (p = 0.003) associated with
higher mortality, while the prevalence
of angle-closure glaucoma showed a
tendency (p = 0.06) of an association.
If, however, an additional adjustment
for the systemic risk factors of male
gender, lower educational level and
smoking was carried out, neither the
presence of open-angle glaucoma nor
of angle-closure glaucoma were factors
associated with higher mortality
(Table 2). One may argue that glaucoma-related defects in the visual field
may increase the risk of accidents as
has also been shown in the Rotterdam
study (Ramrattan et al. 2001). Interestingly, increased mortality was significantly associated with a decreased
best corrected visual acuity (p < 0.001)
and increased visual field defects
(p < 0.001) after adjusting for age in
our study (Table 1).


#### Acta Ophthalmologica 2014

In contrast to the 5-year follow-up of
the Beijing Eye Study and in contrast to
other studies (Cugati et al. 2007a; Xu
et al. 2009), retinal vein occlusions were
not significantly associated with
increased mortality in the multivariate
analysis in our study population. The
reason for the difference in this finding
between the studies has remained elusive. The 10-year mortality rate of 8.5%
in our present study agrees well with the
mortality of 3.2% of the same population within a 5-year follow-up period
(Xu et al. 2009).
There are limitations of the present
study. First, as in any population-based
study, non-participation can be of major
concern. In the Beijing Eye Study, at the
time of the survey in the year 2001, 4439
individuals of 5324 invited individuals
participated in the study, resulting in a
participation rate of 83.4%. Of these
4439 subjects, 2695 subjects or 60.7% of
the participants of 2001 returned for the
re-examination in the year 2011, while
379 (8.5%) subjects were dead, and 1365
(30.8%)subjectswerealive,however,did
not agree to be re-examined. The
decreased rate of participation may,
however, not have influenced the conclusions of our study as one knew
whether the non-participating subjects
were dead or alive. Second, blood
pressure measurements, blood sample
examinations for lipids and glycosylated
haemoglobin and measurements of body
height, weight and body mass index were
not performedatbaseline in2001, sothat
the multivariate analysis did not include
arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia
as risk factors for an increased mortality.
Third,theelderlypopulationfromChina
has a markedly different history and had
profoundly different living conditions in
previous years than elderly populations
in Western countries, so that it is unclear
how far the results of our study can be
transferred to other population and
societies. Fourth, there was no reliable
information on the cause of death for all
peoplewhohaddied,sothatassociations
between the cause of death and preexisting ocular or systemic diseases or
ocular parameters could not be assessed.
In conclusion, after adjustment for
age, gender, level of education and
smoking, mortality was significantly
higher in subjects with diabetic retinopathy, non-glaucomatous optic nerve
damage and nuclear cataract. Other
major ophthalmic parameters and disorders such as hyperopia, myopia, high

myopia, pterygium, age-related macular
degeneration, retinal vein occlusion,
glaucoma and cortical or nuclear cataract were not significantly associated
with mortality. These findings may have
clinical importance as patients in whom
one of the associated ocular conditions is
detected may undergo an intensified
general body examination to detect reasons for it to prevent early death. The
findings may pathogenetically be interesting as the associations, and the lack of
associations, between the ocular disorders and mortality may give some hints
for their pathogenesis.
