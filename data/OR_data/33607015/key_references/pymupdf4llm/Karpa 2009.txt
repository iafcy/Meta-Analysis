**Objective: To investigate pathways from visual impair-**
ment to increased all-cause mortality in older persons.

**Methods: The Blue Mountains Eye Study examined 3654**
persons 49 years and older (82.4% response) during 19921994 and after 5 and 10 years. Australian National Death
Index data confirmed deaths until 2005. Visual impairment was defined as presenting, correctable, and noncorrectable, using better-eye visual acuity. Associations
between visual impairment and mortality risk were estimated using Cox regression and structural equation
modeling.


75 years (HR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.42-4.69). Structural equation modeling revealed greater effects of noncorrectable
visual impairment on mortality risk (HR, 5.25; 95% CI,
1.97-14.01 for baseline ages �75 years), with both direct (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.11-4.23) and indirect (HR, 2.43;
95% CI, 1.17-5.03) effects. Of mortality risk markers examined, only disability in walking demonstrated a significant indirect pathway for the link between visual impairment and mortality.

**Conclusions: Visual impairment predicted mortality by**
both direct and indirect pathways, particularly for persons younger than 75 years with noncorrectable visual
impairment. Disability in walking, which can substantially influence general health, represented a major indirect pathway.

**METHODS**


**STUDY POPULATION**

The Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES) is a population-based
cohort study of vision and common eye diseases in a suburban
Australian population 49 years and older at baseline. The study
was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the
University of Sydney and was conducted adhering to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Signed informed consent
was obtained from all the participants at each examination.

**DATA COLLECTION**

Survey methods and procedures have been described previously.[25] Briefly, baseline examinations of 3654 residents older
than 49 years were conducted during 1992-1994 (BMES 1, 82.4%
participation rate). Of the baseline participants, 2335 (75.1%
of survivors) returned for 5-year follow-up examinations during 1997-1999 (BMES 2), and 1952 participants (53.4% of the
original cohort, or 76.6% of survivors) returned for 10-year follow-up examinations during 2002-2004 (BMES 3). Medical and
smoking histories were determined by interviewer-administered questionnaire at baseline. A history of angina, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, or cancer was determined by responses to questions starting with “Has
a doctor advised you that you have . . . ?” History of smoking
was defined as never, past, or current smoking. Current smokers included those who had stopped smoking within the past
year. Weight in kilograms, height in meters, and systolic and
diastolic blood pressures were also recorded at baseline.
To identify and confirm persons who died after the baseline examination, demographic information, including surname, first and second names, sex, and date of birth of the 3654
participants, was cross-matched with Australian National Death
Index data for deaths to the end of 2005.[26] A probabilistic record linkage package was used, adopting a multiple-pass procedure in which both data sets were grouped based on different characteristics (eg, date of birth, name, sex) each time.
Matches were divided into exact and nonexact. All nonexact
matched records were examined manually and accepted if there
was only 1 nonexact matched characteristic that was not critical. Information provided by family members during follow-up was also included if the participant was reported to have
died on or before December 2005.

**DEFINITIONS**

Classification of hypertension was based on the 2003 World
Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension


guidelines. Participants were classified as having hyperten
sion stage 1 if systolic blood pressure was 140 to 159 mm Hg
or if diastolic blood pressure was 90 to 99 mm Hg. Participants were classified as having hypertension stage 2 if they were
previously diagnosed with hypertension and were using antihypertensive medications, if systolic blood pressure was 160
mm Hg or greater, or if diastolic blood pressure was 100 mm Hg
or greater at examination. Body mass index was calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, with
less than 20 defined as low. Disability in walking at baseline
was assessed as present if the participant was observed by a
trained examiner to have walking difficulties or used walking
aids or a wheelchair.
Visual acuity (VA) was assessed using a logMAR chart. Visual acuity was initially assessed with patients wearing their
current eyeglasses. If initial VA was less than 54 letters read
correctly (�20/20 Snellen equivalent), refraction was performed. Visual impairment was categorized as presenting visual impairment (PVI), VA less than 20/40 Snellen equivalent
(�39lettersreadcorrectly)inthebettereyeusingcurrentglasses;
correctable visual impairment (CVI), PVI correctable to 20/40
Snellen equivalent or better by subjective refraction; and noncorrectable visual impairment (NCVI), PVI correctable to worse
than 20/40 Snellen equivalent in the better eye after subjective
refraction.

**STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**

Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.13 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) and Mplus.[28]
Simple statistics included t tests for comparing means and �[2]
tests for comparing proportions. Cox regression models were
used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariable-adjusted models included variables found significantly associated with mortality after age adjustment. These were history of acute myocardial infarction,
stroke, angina and hypertension, current smoking, low BMI,
cancer, diabetes, walking disability, home ownership, tertiary
education, and self-rated health. Additional stratified analyses
were conducted by age group (�75 years vs �75 years) to assess whether the impact from visual impairment was stronger
on premature mortality of the relatively younger age group at
baseline (�75 years). A P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.
Structural equation modeling pathway analysis[23] was used
to model the relationship between visual impairment, survival, and covariables found significantly associated with mortality by Cox regression. The SEM was fit using the Mplus[28]
statistical package with maximum likelihood and Monte Carlo
integration methods. Standard errors were calculated using the
delta method and hazard rates obtained from the coefficients
by exponentiation. The covariables used in the model were history of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, angina and hypertension, current smoking, low BMI, cancer, diabetes, walking
disability, home ownership, tertiary education, and self-rated
health. The multiple potential pathways to mortality are shown
in Figure 1. Each variable was adjusted for age and sex. The
indirect effect of visual impairment was then calculated for each
covariable by multiplying the effects of that covariable on mortality and visual impairment on the covariable. Models were
simplified by removing indirect pathways for individual covariables that were not significant at the P value level of .10.
The total indirect effect of visual impairment could then be calculated by summating the coefficients of the estimated indirect effects of each mediating variable and then converting to
HRs. The total estimated effect of visual impairment on mortality was calculated by summating the coefficients of the indirect and direct effects and then converting to HRs.

use of walking aids. They were less likely to have tertiary
education or to own their home. There were no significant differences in the proportions of current smokers or

**ASSOCIATION BETWEEN**
**VISUAL IMPAIRMENT AND MORTALITY**

**Table 2 shows all-cause mortality rates and mortality risk**
after age and sex adjustment, which were higher in persons with visual impairment compared with those with
normal vision. This difference was greater in persons
younger than 75 years compared with those 75 years and
older at baseline. Persons younger than 75 years with visualimpairmentwereatgreaterriskofPVI,CVI,andNCVI
(PVI: HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.32-2.17; CVI: HR, 1.60; 95%
CI, 1.23-2.09; NCVI: HR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.42-4.69). The
associations for all ages combined remained either significant or marginally significant after multivariable adjustment (Table 2), although they were substantially attenuated in magnitude (PVI: HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09-1.52; CVI:
HR,1.26;95%CI,1.04-1.53;NCVI:HR,1.35;95%CI,1.041.75).Inpersonsyoungerthan75years,onlyPVIandNCVI
were statistically associated with mortality, while for those
75 years and older, only PVI was significantly associated
with mortality, after multivariable adjustment.
Structural equation modeling pathway analysis confirmedthatvisualimpairmentinfluencedmortalitybyboth
direct and indirect pathways. Table 3 shows the HRs
and 95% CIs using this model. The pattern was similar
to the Cox regression models, except that the HRs were
higher when estimated using SEM.
Of the risk markers investigated by SEM, only disability in walking represented a significant indirect pathway
from visual impairment to mortality. Table 4 lists the HRs
and 95% CIs for the indirect effects of disability in walking on mortality. Figures 1, 2, and 3 illustrate the detailed pathways that could explain the associations found
between visual impairment and mortality. There was a significant indirect pathway from visual impairment to mortality via disability in walking, through poorer self-rated
health, to mortality (Table 4) (Figures 1, 2, and 3). An indirect pathway through lower BMI bordered on significance for NCVI in all age groups (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.991.48; _P=.06)butwasnotsignificantforotherformsofvisual_

There was no indirect pathway through any other mortality risk markers (eg, history of angina, acute myocardial
infarction, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, or smoking). There were also no indirect pathways from visual impairment to mortality through lower home ownership or
education levels. There was no indirect pathway from visual impairment to mortality through poorer self-rated
health that was independent of disability in walking.


**COMMENT**


In agreement with previous reports,[1-8] we observed that the
presence of visual impairment predicted mortality in older
persons. Using Cox regression models, PVI predicted mortality independent of age, sex, and the presence of known
mortality risk markers. Using SEM analysis, we confirmed that visual impairment increased mortality via both
direct and indirect pathways. The relationship between visual impairment and mortality was strongest for NCVI
among persons with baseline ages younger than 75 years.
Compared with estimates from SEM, Cox regression
appears to underestimate the effect of visual impairment
on mortality by overcorrecting for intermediate variables
that were associated with both visual impairment and mortality. To determine which indirect effects were important in predicting mortality for visually impaired persons, we modeled each covariate as a pathway to mortality
(Table 4). Of the mortality risk markers we assessed, only
disabilityinwalkingrepresentedasignificantindirectpathway. For this association, 2 possible pathways were identified; 1 pathway involved only disability in walking, and
the second also involved an effect through low self-rated
health (Table 4) (Figure 1). Because of reduced power
through fewer events, we were unable to differentiate indirect effects via age. The age-related trend for mortality,
however, suggests that in persons younger than 75 years

tween visual impairment and mortality after correcting for
covariates in older populations or in analyses that included all ages in 1 model.[1,10,13] Similar findings are reported for cardiovascular risk factors where risk factors
lose their predictive power after ages of 80 years and
older.[1,29-31] One explanation is a ceiling effect, where mortality risk is already high in persons 75 years and older because of multiple mortality risk factors so that there is a
limit to the additional contribution from visual impairment to mortality. Another explanation is “selective survival,” that is, persons genetically predisposed to die of
causes related to visual impairment will do so at a relatively younger age, leaving those without this predisposition to survive into very old age.

vides information on the magnitude of the association but
not its direction. There are several mechanisms that could
explain the associations we found between visual impairment and mortality. Persons with various disabilities in
walking may be less likely to see a doctor regularly or to
have prescriptions for critical medications filled. They may
be more socially isolated, have a poorer and relatively unvaried diet, and less able to seek urgent help when needed.
They may also be less likely to exercise regularly, leading
to lower cardiorespiratory reserve and greater risk of death
during the stress of illness. Disabilities in walking are also
associated with increasing risk of falls and fractures (eg,
hip fractures),[32] which may lead to an increased risk of
death.
For the direct pathway, there are probably many unidentified covariates that were not accounted for. One example is poor diet, which is associated with age-related
macular degeneration,[33-35] cataract,[36,37] cancer,[38,39] diabe

Disability in Poor self-rated
walking health[†]

**Figure 3. Structural equation modeling path for the relationship between**
correctable visual impairment, risk markers, and all-cause mortality in all
ages, showing hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (total
indirect: HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.00-1.61). Covariates are corrected for age and
sex. *Other covariates include the mortality risk markers angina, myocardial
infarction, stroke, cancer, hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, home
ownership, tertiary education, and self-rated health. †There was no

tes,[40,41] and cardiovascular disease.[38,39,42] We found some
evidence of an indirect association through lower BMI
to mortality for NCVI, which may support this speculation. The direct pathway may also be explained by some
systemic processes that are common to both visual impairment and mortality, such as chronic inflammation.
To our knowledge, only 1 other study has used SEM
to examine the pathways from visual impairment to mortality. In agreement with their findings, our study reported a small but significant indirect effect through disability.[24] In contrast to our results, however, these authors
reported that self-rated health was a significant indirect
pathway that was independent of disability in walking.
Other notable differences from this earlier study were that


the indirect pathways had a lower magnitude than the
direct pathway and the HRs were much lower in comparison with those estimated from our study sample. There
were 2 main differences between this earlier study and
ours that may explain this disagreement. First, while the
earlier study was comparable with ours in many ways,
there was no objective measure of VA. Visual function
was assessed by self-reporting and proxy reporting of visual impairment by asking whether each person was blind
or had difficulty seeing from one or both eyes. This could
have introduced bias because persons with lower selfrated health and/or disability might have been more likely
to overestimate visual impairment and vice versa. Second, the earlier study included persons 18 years and older
in comparison with 49 years and older in our study.
The strengths of our study include its large populationbased data set, with high participation and long follow-up period, standardized VA assessment, use of Australian National Death Index mortality and causes of death
data, and detailed data on the health and functional status of participants. Limitations include the possibility that
not all potential mortality markers were included in the
model, such as exercise, diet, and nutrition variables. Also,
the relatively low number of persons with visual impairment after age stratification limits our ability to detect
weak associations that could be significant. Limitations
of SEM include the assumption that relationships between variables in the model are linear and that the directions of the arrows in the path model are assumed but
cannot be proven.
In conclusion, this study reaffirms that visual impairment is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Analysis using SEM suggests both direct and indirect pathways for this relationship. Disability in walking
may represent an important indirect pathway to mortality for persons with visual impairment, and adjusting for
this factor in statistical analysis may overadjust for the
indirect effect of visual impairment on mortality risk. The
impact of visual impairment on mortality may in fact be
greater than that reported from previous studies that have
used traditional statistical models.
