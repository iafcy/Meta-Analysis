            "criteria": "In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, and Global Health database on Feb 1, 2020, for studies published in English between database inception and Feb 1, 2020. We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies that measured the association between vision impairment and all-cause mortality in people aged 40 years or older, who were followed up for 1 year or more. In a protocol amendment, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as long as the reported association between vision impairment and mortality was independent of the study intervention; we also included RCTs and cohort studies with participants younger than 40 years if more than 50% of participants were aged 40 years or older. We assessed the effect of these protocol amendments on effect estimates in meta-regression analyses. Conference abstracts and grey literature were not included. We identified additional studies by searching the reference lists of included studies. The searches were done by an information specialist (IG), and the search strategy and full list of search terms used are provided in the appendix (pp 2\u20135).",
