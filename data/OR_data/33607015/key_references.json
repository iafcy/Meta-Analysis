A cohort of 1422 participants, of age 60 years and above, was examined at baseline, for their visual and hearing status. Data on the sociodemographic factors, various comorbidities, activities of daily living, and self-rated health were recorded. Baseline data was collected for the period May 2008 to August 2008. Follow-up data collection for mortality was completed in December 2009. The median follow-up period was 518 days.\n## RESULTS\nOne hundred out of 1422 elderly (7.0%) participants died during the follow-up period. Significant hazard ratios were found after adjustment for various comorbid conditions. On adjustment for sociodemographic factors (age, sex, and literacy), neither blindness nor hearing impairment was found to be significantly associated with mortality. After adjustment for all covariates in the study, hearing impairment (Hazard Ratio = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.29 - 3.54) was found to be significantly associated with mortality in the age group \u226570 years.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrated that hearing impairment was an independent risk factor for mortality in people aged \u226570 years. Similar studies with a longer period of follow-up are required in India, to guide public health interventions.\n",

A stratified random sample of 1,947 males and females aged 70 and older were interviewed, and 1,500 were assessed on measures of health, memory. verbal ability, processing speed, vision, hearing, and grip strength in 1992 and 1994. Analyses of incident rate ratios for mortality over 4- and 6-year periods were conducted using Cox hierarchical regression analyses. Results showed that poor performance on nearly all cognitive variables was associated with mortality, but many of these effects were explained by measures of self-rated health and disease. Significant decline in hearing and cognitive performance also predicted mortality as did incomplete data at Wave 1. Results suggest that poor cognitive performance and cognitive decline in very old adults reflect both biological aging and disease processes.\n",

In fully adjusted models, participants with advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) compared with participants with few, if any, drusen had increased mortality (relative risk [RR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.86). Advanced AMD was associated with cardiovascular deaths. Compared with participants having good acuity in both eyes, those with visual acuity worse than 20/40 in 1 eye had increased mortality (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12-1.65). Nuclear opacity (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.12-1.75) and cataract surgery (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.18-2.05) were associated with increased all-cause mortality and with cancer deaths.

Generalized estimating equations assuming a negative binomial distribution were used to estimate relative rates of hospital admissions, lengths of stay, and mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic variables and comorbidity. Emergency department and mental health service visits also were quantified.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nRelative rates of hospital admissions, lengths of stay, and mortality, as well as crude proportions of ED and mental health service visits.\n## RESULTS\nThe blind cohort comprised 1726 individuals alongside 1726 matched controls; 39% were men, and the mean age was 83 years. Combined, the cohorts accumulated a total of 34 130 hospital admissions amounting to 201 867 bed-days. After adjusting for the principal reason for hospital admission and comorbidity, the blind cohort was admitted to the hospital 11% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6%-17%) more often than the control cohort. The blind cohort also stayed in the hospital longer than the controls, but this effect varied by age. Blind participants 65 to 69 years of age spent 88% more days (95% CI, 27%-178%) in the hospital compared with age-matched controls, whereas there was no difference in length of stay between the cohorts by 80 years of age (rate ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.97-1.25). A larger proportion of the blind cohort visited a hospital ED and accessed mental health services compared with the control cohort.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nHealth service use is increased for the elderly blind compared with age-matched controls after accounting for comorbidity. The elderly blind have more hospital admissions, ED visits, and mental health-related visits. The younger elderly blind stay longer in hospital. However, there was no evidence of worse mortality outcomes after adjusting for comorbidity.\n",

The goals of this study are to determine whether visual acuity loss increases the risk of dying and to examine whether depressive symptoms act as a mediator in this relationship.\n## METHODS\nData were derived from the 2520 older adults who participated in the Salisbury Eye Evaluation project, a population-based prospective 8-year cohort study. Presenting binocular visual acuity was measured with the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] eye chart and depressive symptoms with the General Health Questionnaire Part D subscale. Mortality data were collected by staff follow-up. Analyses were performed with the Cox proportional hazards regression.\n## RESULTS\nWorse baseline acuity was associated with a higher mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.09). Also, those who gained two or more lines of visual acuity over 2 years had a lower adjusted risk of dying (HR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.95). An interaction was detected, in that women who lost > or =3 lines of visual acuity over a 2-year period had a higher adjusted risk of dying (HR = 3.97; 95% CI, 2.21-7.15), whereas men did not (HR = 1.32; 95% CI, 0.66-2.63). Depressive symptoms did not mediate these relationships.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIf the relationship between visual acuity and mortality is indeed causal, it most likely acts via numerous pathways through a variety of intervening variables. The identification of these intervening variables could give additional targets for intervention if acuity cannot be restored.\n",

Usual-corrected visual acuity was then obtained with participants wearing glasses or contact lenses, if any. Analytical methods included Cox regression models with adjustment for sample weights and design effects as well as age, gender, smoking status, and self-rated health.\n## RESULTS\nMultivariate survival analyses found a significant interaction between race and visual impairment status; consequently, race-specific analyses were performed. There were no significant associations between uncorrected binocular visual acuity impairment (20/50 or worse) and all-cause mortality or cancer mortality. There was no significant association between impaired uncorrected acuity and cardiovascular disease mortality in African Americans (Hazard Ratio=0.67, 95% CI: 0.35-1.26), but this association was significant in non-Hispanic Whites (Hazard Ratio=1.21, 95% CI: 1.01-1.45). In multivariate models, within race groups, impaired usual-corrected visual acuity was not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality or mortality due to cancer or cardiovascular disease.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nUncorrected and usual-corrected binocular distance visual impairment is not associated with all-cause mortality or cancer mortality. Cardiovascular disease mortality risk may be slightly higher in non-Hispanic Whites with uncorrected visual acuity impairment.\n",

Methods: Data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants (\u226518 years old) were linked with the death record data of the National Death Index (NDI) with mortality follow-up through December 31, 2011. Cognitive performance was evaluated by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and cognitive performance impairment was defined as the DSST score equal to or less than the median value in the study population. Visual impairment (VI) was defined as presenting visual acuity worse than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye. Risks of all-cause and specific-cause mortality were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models after adjusting for confounders. Results: A total of 2,550 participants 60 years and older from two waves of (NHANES, 1999-2000, 2001-2002) were included in the current analysis. Over a median follow-up period of 9.92 years, 952 (35.2%) died of all causes, of whom 239 (23.1%), 224 (24.0%), and 489 (52.9%) died from cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and non-CVD/non-cancer mortality, respectively. Cognitive performance impairment and VI increased the odds for mortality. Co-presence of VI among cognitive impaired elderly persons predicted nearly a threefold increased risk of all-cause mortality [hazard ratios (HRs), 2.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.02-3.70; P < 0.001) and almost a fourfold higher risk of non-CVD/non-cancer mortality (HR, 3.72; 95% CI, 2.30-6.00; P < 0.001) compared to having neither impairment. Conclusion: People aged 60 years and over with poorer cognitive performance were at higher risk of long-term mortality, and were especially vulnerable to further mortality when concomitant with VI.
