            "title": "[The pathology of meningiomas; a study of 121 cases].",
            "abstract": "Although the biologic behavior of meningiomas is relatively uniform, their histologic appearance is variable. Because of this, numerous classifications1-7 of two fundamental types have been proposed for them: embryologic and purely morphologic. The embryologic approach, best exemplified in the study by Globus,' aims at finding evidence of different stages of embryologic development of the meninges in the different appearances of the tumor. There are, however, several objections to this method. First, the origin of the meninges in neuro-ectoderm or mesoderm is still uncertain. In fact the importance of this origin probably has been over-emphasized. In discussing the classification of tumors in general, Willis8 recently stated: \"The germ-layers, the status of which has of recent years greatly declined even for the embryologist, are devoid of significance for the pathologist.\" Secondly, the analogy between the neoplasm and the developing meninges based on microscopic appearance is easy to make but difficult to prove. Such an idea, therefore, must remain merely an hypothesis. Lastly, the correlation between prognosis and so-called histofunctional differentiation is so poor that classifications based on embryogenetic concepts cannot be justified even on clinical grounds. In the morphologic approach an attempt is made to classify meningiomas by the histologic features considered most prominent. Such classifications are valuable to the pathologist, but difficulties are encountered when the schemes become too complicated. This is frequently the case since, as it is well known, meningiomas are extremely polymorphic. Cushing and Eisenhardt,6 in their morphologic classi-fication, thus achieved nine types subdivided into twenty variants, although they admitted that \"Fine architectural distinctions, while of academic interest, are unimportant unless they can be shown to have some bearing on clinical treatment and prognosis.\" The latter obviously is not true of the existing classifications. Based on a study of I2I meningiomas, it is our intention to present a new approach which affords a means for describing rather than classifying these neoplasms and in so doing sets up diagnostic criteria. The most important step in the understanding of these tumors was made by Schmidt\" in 1902, when he discovered that the cellular structure of meningiomas was comparable to cell clusters capping the arachnoid villi and the cell nests included in the dura mater. This work unfortunately was forgotten until Cushing,10 in 1922, re-emphasized the finding and further showed that the location of such cell nests were \"favoured seats of origin\" of meningiomas. The structural identity of normal arachnoid villi and the meningioma is indeed striking and offers the best criterion for recognition of the tumor. Such an origin explains why meningiomas, although arachnoidal in origin, are frequently adherent to the dura mater, but may occur in other regions such as the ventricular system or Sylvian fissure, without attachment to pachymeninges. With this in mind, the description of meningiomas may be considered. These neoplasms are composed of two parts: (i) the basic cellular constituents which are meningocytic or fibroblastic cells organized at least in some places in a specific pattern known as a whorl; (2) the secondary components made up of different forms of tissue which may be absent, minimal, or prominent in the tumor. The meningeal origin of the neoplasm can be established with certainty only when some part of it contains meningocytic or fibroblastic cells arranged in a whorl pattern. The secondary components are not essential to the diagnosis although they are seen in recurrent patterns which frequently are of aid to the pathologist. The meningiomas will thus be considered using the following outline. It is emphasized that this is viewed as a description rather than as a classification. Such a plan is flexible but precise and clear. Any meningioma can be defined exactly, if necessary, by addition of new components. For example, a tumor may be described as meningocytic meningioma with prominent angiomatous component. This concept not only provides rigid criteria for the diagnosis of the neoplasm but also enables the problem of differential diagnosis of other neoplasms of the meninges to be handled easily. As will be shown, these other tumors can reproduce the patterns of secondary components but do not contain the basic cellular constituents.",

Only with multiple primary tumors involving the brain and breast did the number of observed cases significantly exceed the number of expected cases; eight patients who had a meningioma associated with a breast cancer accounted for this excess. Patients with breast cancer presenting with signs or symptoms of an intracranial neoplasm should be carefully evaluated, for the intracranial lesion may be a potentially curable meningioma.\n",

In this study, we aim to identify the sociodemographic and clinicopathologic features of women with breast cancer associated with a higher risk of developing a meningioma.\n## METHODS\nThe SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) database (18 registries) was used to identify women with breast cancer as their first neoplasm. The risk of subsequent meningioma was reported as the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and was analyzed by sociodemographic and clinicopathologic subgroups. Results are given as SIR (95% confidence interval [CI]).\n## RESULTS\nA total of 564,516 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2004 and 2016 were included for analysis. A 26% increased risk of meningioma development (SIR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.19-1.33; P < 0.05) was found in the cohort compared with the general population. Patients aged between 18 and 49 years (SIR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.78-2.61; P < 0.05) and those with a more advanced tumor stage (stage IV; SIR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.71-3.25; P < 0.05) were at a higher risk. Hormone receptor expression and treatment modality subgroups were at a similar risk compared with the general population.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur study corroborated the known association between these tumors and found a 26% risk of meningioma development in women with breast cancer, with younger patients and those with a more aggressive disease having a higher than expected risk.\n",

However, it is unclear whether medication with tamoxifen can prevent meningioma. Our study cohort included all women who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1961 and 2010, and a total of 227\u2009535 women were identified with breast cancer with a median age at diagnosis of 63 years. Women diagnosed with breast cancer after 1987 were defined as tamoxifen exposed; those diagnosed with breast cancer before or during 1987 were defined as not exposed to tamoxifen. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to calculate the risk of subsequent meningioma. Of these women, 223 developed meningioma. For women without tamoxifen exposure, the risk of meningioma was significantly increased, with an SIR of 1.54 (95% confidence interval 1.30-1.81); the risk was not increased in those with tamoxifen exposure (SIR=1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.84-1.32). The increased risk of meningioma in women without tamoxifen exposure persisted during 10 years of follow-up. In this historical cohort study, we found that women diagnosed with breast cancer but not treated with tamoxifen had an increased incidence of meningioma, whereas the incidence was close to that of the general population in patients treated with tamoxifen. This suggests that tamoxifen may prevent the development of meningioma.\n",

Widespread extracranial metastases were present at autopsy in 7 cases. Brain metastases were seen in 1 case. Neurologic signs were referred in 4 subjects. Four breast cancers and one meningioma showed immunoreactivity for progesterone receptors, whereas all the cases were negative for estrogen receptors. In one case, metastatic breast carcinoma tissue was present within a psammomatous meningioma. A brief review of the literature, which includes 14 similar observations, is reported. Although the association of breast cancer and meningioma is still difficult to explain, its clinical implications are important and deserve proper attention.
