            "abstract": "From a series of 100 consecutive breast carcinomas with axillary lymph node metastases, two cases of necrotic granulomas in the nodes are presented. Lymph nodes in each case were characterized by areas of necrosis surrounded by a palisade of cells resembling histiocytes as seen in a rheumatoid nodule. Although the initial impression was that of a reactive granuloma, when immunostained for keratin and EMA, the areas of necrosis showed positive staining for keratin and EMA in a cytoplasmic pattern. The surrounding palisade of cells stained with histiocyte markers, while the necrotic area itself was negative. Staining for both estrogen and progesterone markers was also negative. Staining of nine lymph nodes with caseating granulomas not associated with carcinoma with the same panel of antibodies revealed no staining except for irregular, noncellular staining with EMA. This pattern of necrosis in axillary lymph nodes from two cases of breast carcinoma was interpreted as evidence of necrotic metastatic tumor cells. Necrosis in axillary lymph nodes associated with invasive breast cancer should arouse suspicion for metastasis."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The present study sought to identify couples' cognitive appraisals of breast cancer and the extent to which matched or mismatched appraisals within a couple contribute to distress.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Women with breast cancer (n = 57) and their partners completed the Cognitive Appraisals of Health Scale along with two self-report measures of distress, the Profile of Mood States and the Impact of Events Scale. Four groups were created based on their cognitive appraisals. Couples where both patient and partner scored highest on challenge or benign appraisals formed the positive outlook group (P+S+); when both scored highest on threat or harm/loss, they formed the negative outlook group (P-S-). In the mismatched groups, the patient had a positive outlook, and their partner had a negative outlook (P+S-), or vice versa (P-S+).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In general, lower distress was related to participants' own positive outlook.

When the patient had a negative outlook, a partner negative outlook was associated with the highest psychological distress. When the partner had a negative outlook, a patient positive outlook was associated with the highest psychological distress. There are several possible explanations for these findings, each with different implications for clinical practice. Future research with different groups of cancer patients and longitudinal, mixed methods designs may clarify their meaning."

Methods: Seventy-eight cases of IBC-NST with excision were included. The expression of FoxM1 and BCRP was assessed by immunohistochemistry and its relationship with the clinical pathological characteristics and prognosis was evaluated. Results: FoxM1 was expressed in 71.8%(56/78) of IBC-NST, and the expression was related to tumor diameter, TNM staging, ER, PR and HER2. BCRP was expressed in 53.8% (42/78) of IBC-NST, and the expression was related to age, tumor diameter, lymph node metastasis, ER and HER2. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed the survival time was related to tumor diameter, TNM staging, lymph node metastasis and the expression of FoxM1, BCRP, ER, PR and HER2. Cox multivariate analysis showed that TNM staging, FoxM1, BCRP, HER2 were determinants of patient survival time. Conclusions: The expression of FoxM1 is associated with tumor diameter, TNM staging, ER, PR and HER2 while BCRP is associated with age, tumor diameter, lymph node metastasis, ER and HER2. Both FoxM1 and BCRP have prognostic significance in IBC-NST patients."

Women who were taller than 159 cm (OR: 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.9) had approximately twice the risk of women shorter than 150 cm. Body mass index as a measure of generalized obesity did not significantly predict risk for breast carcinoma. Reproductive and menstrual factors significantly related to risk for breast carcinoma were number of deliveries (OR: 0.81; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9; P < 0.001), age at last delivery (P = 0.03), and use of hormone replacement therapy (OR: 0.54; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9; P = 0.01).

            "abstract": "As multigene panel testing for hereditary cancer syndromes becomes commonplace, germline mutations in genes other than BRCA1/2 are increasingly identified in breast cancer patients. While histopathologic features of BRCA-mutated breast cancers have been well-characterized, less is known about non-BRCA-related hereditary cancers. We herein investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of breast cancers in women with non-BRCA germline mutations. Out of 612 women who underwent germline testing, 16 (2.6%) women with 18 cancers had mutations in non-BRCA genes: ATM, CHEK2, PALB2, TP53, BMPR1A, BRIP1, MUTYH, and RAD50. An additional 2 cancers were identified in a woman with a diagnosis of Bloom syndrome (BLM mutation) who was not germline tested. Average age at diagnosis was 50 (range: 27-77), and 65% had no personal cancer history. The majority (79%) of tumors were grade 1 to 2; 35% were either lobular or ductal with lobular features. Stromal responses varied from absent to desmoplastic to sclerotic; 69% of cases had an in situ component. With the exception of a brisk lymphocytic response in BLM- and TP53-mutated cancers, lymphocytic infiltration was mild or absent. In summary, the majority of non-BRCA-related hereditary breast cancers represent the patient's sentinel malignancy. Lobular features were seen in a subset, and high-grade, immunogenic carcinomas were uncommon except in the setting of BLM and TP53 mutations. Overall, these findings demonstrate a range of involved genes in non-BRCA mutation carriers with breast cancer and histopathologic heterogeneity in the associated cancers, arguing against use of histomorphology to inform panel testing algorithms."

In this study, the biological and prognostic value of FOXA1 expression was assessed immunohistochemically in a large and well-characterised series of invasive breast carcinoma with a long term follow-up using tissue microarray. FOXA1 expression was associated with steroid hormone receptors (ERalpha, PgR and AR), other variables of good prognosis such as smaller tumour size, lower histological grade, luminal cytokeratins (CK18 and CK7/8), BRCA1 and E-cadherin. Its expression showed an inverse relation with basal CKs (CK14 and CK5/6) and P-cadherin. We found an association between high FOXA1 expression and a better survival in the whole series however; multivariate analysis showed that FOXA1 was not an independent prognostic marker. In conclusion, our results show that FOXA1 protein is associated with markers of good prognosis supporting its role as a growth repressor in breast cancer. In this series, FOXA1 was found not to be of an independent prognostic significance in breast cancer and as such its immunohistochemical assessment alone does not appear to have relevance in routine practice to stratify ER-positive (luminal-like) tumours into clinically significant subgroups."

It has been suggested that an inverse correlation exists between cystatin A and malignant progression. We wanted to assess the biological and clinical significance of cystatin A in infiltrative breast carcinoma by immunohistochemical staining. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material from 440 cases treated during the years 1988-1991 was used in the study. After exclusion of patients with disseminated disease at diagnosis, previous contralateral breast carcinoma, and absence of follow-up data, 384 patients could be included in the survival analysis. For immunohistochemical analysis of cystatin A, we used monoclonal cystatin A antibody WR-23/2/3/3, the binding of which was detected by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. Immunohistochemical analysis of Bcl-2 and p53 was also done, and mitotic activity was evaluated. Positive staining for cystatin A was found in 52 of 440 cases. The staining was irregular but showed irrefutably positive areas within neoplastic tissue. Most of the positive tumors were of the ductal infiltrative type, but two were mucinous carcinomas, one medullary and one squamous cell carcinoma. No lobular carcinomas showed positive staining. Focal cystatin A positivity was seen in myoepithelial cells of benign ducts. Occasional apoptotic bodies within the neoplasm showed strong positivity for cystatin A. Tumors positive for cystatin A were of larger size and had higher mitotic activity than cystatin A-negative tumors. Cystatin A was associated with negative Bcl-2 staining, but there was no statistically significant association between axillary lymph node status or p53 immunostaining. The risk for breast cancer-related death was significantly higher in patients with cystatin A-positive tumors than in those with cystatin A-negative ones. The risk increase was significant also in lymph node-negative patients. After adjusting for the effect of tumor size, histological grade, and lymph node status, cystatin A-positive patients still had a higher risk of death. Patients with cystatin A and p53 coexpression had a higher risk of death than the other patients. The findings reveal a new variant of aggressive breast cancer. This type of carcinoma may develop during tumor progression through genetic instability that allows cystatin A expression and gives growth advantage to a clone of tumor cells."

Only membranous expression of E-cadherin was considered in this study and its expression was categorized as normal (H-score>100) or reduced [absent or below the median (score</=100)]. Complete absence of its expression (score=0) was detected in 7.2% of cases. On univariate analysis, reduced E-cadherin expression was associated with a reduced disease-free interval and overall survival and also with indicators of poor prognosis including larger tumour size, higher histological grade, development of distant metastasis and tumours negative for oestrogen receptors. No association between E-cadherin expression and lymph node status was found. On multivariate analysis, E-cadherin was an independent predictor of disease-free interval [hazards ratio (HR) 1.56, 95% confidence intrerval (CI) 1.23, 1.99; P<0.001] and overall survival (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.09, 2.14; P=0.013) and there was some evidence that the prognostic value was greater in those with positive lymph nodes (P interaction=0.099).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These results suggest that E-cadherin loss may play a role in progression, development of distant metastasis and recurrence in non-lobular invasive carcinomas of the breast and its assessment by immunohistochemistry may help in the identification of patients with poor outcomes."

BRCA genetic testing has both medical and psychosocial implications for individuals seeking testing and their family members. However, promoting open and adaptive communication about cancer risk in the family is challenging for parents of minor children. Using prospective data collected from mothers undergoing BRCA genetic testing and their untested co-parents (N = 102 parenting dyads), we examined how maternal and co-parent characteristics independently and conjointly influenced the overall quality of parent-child communication with minor children. Statistical associations were tested in accordance with the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model. Significant Actor effects were observed among mothers, such that open parent-child communication prior to genetic testing was positively associated with open communication 6 months following receipt of genetic test results; and among co-parents, more open parent-child communication at baseline and greater perceived quality of the parenting relationship were associated with more open parent-child communication at follow-up. Partner effects were also observed: co-parents' baseline communication and confidence in their ability to communicate with their minor children about genetic testing was positively associated with open maternal parent-child communication at follow-up. These results demonstrate that for families facing the prospect of cancer genetic testing, perceptions and behaviors of both members of child-rearing couples have important implications for the overall quality of communication with their minor children, including communication about cancer risk."

Changes of elevated CEA levels followed the clinical response to therapy in 22/22 metastatic disease patient-trials. The levels decreased with a response in 15 trials and rose with progressive disease or relapse in seven trials. The incidence of CEA elevations and quantitative CEA levels both rose with increasing clinical tumor burden from the postoperative state through the preoperative state to two or more organ sites of metastatic involvement. No relationship was demonstrable among limited samples between preoperative or postoperative CEA levels and prognosis; however, in metastatic disease, pretherapy CEA levels greater than 5 ng/ml were associated with low response rates and early therapeutic failure to chemotherapy. The highest frequency of elevated CEA levels was observed in patients with osseous involvement (79%) and the lowest frequency with skin (52%) and breast (50%) metastases. Liver and osseous disease were also associated with higher mean CEA levels than were other sites of metastatic involvement. CEA levels appear to be elevated in the majority of patients with metastatic disease and be of prognostic importance in metastatic disease.

A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of human MDM2 (SNP309) was shown to associate with increased MDM2 expression and increased risk of cancer. This study evaluated the association of a SNP in human MDM4 (C>T) with age of onset of breast cancer in two independent cohorts. In cohort 1 of 675 patients, the average age of diagnosis for women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative breast cancers was 53.2 and 48 years, respectively. In this cohort, homozygous variant (TT) carriers developed ER-negative carcinomas at an earlier age than homozygous wild-type (CC) or heterozygous (TC) such that the age at diagnosis was accelerated by 5.0 years (P = 0.018). This association was validated in a second cohort of breast cancer patients (n = 148), where TT carriers with ER-negative cancer developed the disease 3.8 years earlier than CC carriers (P = 0.006). The effect was more pronounced in Caucasians with ER-negative ductal carcinomas with TT homozygotes developing disease 7.5 years (P = 0.031) and 6.2 years (P = 7 x 10(-5)) earlier than CC carriers in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. No association was seen in ER-positive ductal cancers suggesting that the SNP in MDM4 only has a functional association in ER-negative breast cancer."

Loss of function of WRN is associated with Werner syndrome (WS), which is characterized by premature aging and cancer predisposition. Malignancies that are commonly linked to WS are thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, breast cancer, meningioma, and soft tissue and bone sarcomas. Currently, the clinicopathologic significance of WRN in breast cancer is largely unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      We investigated the clinicopathologic and prognostic significance of WRN protein expression in a cohort of clinically annotated series of sporadic (n = 1650) and BRCA-mutated (n = 75) invasive breast cancers. We correlated WRN protein expression to clinicopathologic characteristics, DNA repair protein expression, and survival outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There is strong evidence of association between low nuclear and cytoplasmic WRN co-expression and low levels of KU70/KU80, DNA-PK, DNA Pol-B, CKD18, cytoplasmic RECQL4, and nuclear BLM protein expression (adjusted P-values < .05). Tumors with low nuclear or cytoplasmic WRN expression have worse overall breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) (adjusted P-values < .05). In topoisomerase I overexpressed tumors, low WRN nuclear expression was associated with poor BCSS (P-value < .05).

All women underwent definitive surgery with node biopsy and none received adjuvant systemic therapy. Special types, tubular, invasive cribriform and mucinous, with a very favourable prognosis can be identified. A common type of tumour recognized by our group and designated tubular mixed carcinoma is shown to be prognostically distinct from carcinomas of no special type; it has a characteristic histological appearance and is the third most common type in this series. Analysis of subtypes of lobular carcinoma confirms differing prognoses. The classical, tubulo-lobular and lobular mixed types are associated with a better prognosis than carcinomas of no special type; this is not so for the solid variant. Tubulo-lobular carcinoma in particular has an extremely good prognosis similar to tumours included in the 'special type' category above. Neither medullary carcinoma nor atypical medullary carcinoma are found to carry a survival advantage over carcinomas of no special type. The results confirm that histological typing of human breast carcinoma can provide useful prognostic information."

The RR decreased with advancing maternal age at time of diagnosis to 1.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.2) for maternal diagnosis after the age of 70 years. Having a sister with a history of breast cancer also was related to increased risk; for women with one sister with breast cancer compared with those with one sister without such a history, the age-adjusted RR was 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.4). Women whose mother and sister both had a history of breast cancer had an RR of 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 4.2) compared with those without a family history.

However, the risk associated with a mother or sister history of breast cancer is smaller than suggested by earlier retrospective studies. Overall, within this population of middle-aged women, only 2.5% of breast cancer cases are attributable to a positive family history."

Diet during the year preceding diagnosis was assessed by interview using a food frequency questionnaire covering the intake of 114 food items. Prognostic indicators included axillary node involvement at diagnosis, estrogen receptor status, and selected histologic features of the primary tumor such as nuclear grade, histologic grade, tubule formation, mitotic activity, and nuclear size of tumor cells. After adjustment for total energy intake, age, body weight, and tumor size at diagnosis, an increase in saturated fat intake was related to an increased frequency of node involvement at diagnosis among postmenopausal patients. In contrast, an elevation in polyunsaturated fat intake was related to a reduction of the percentage of patients with positive nodes at diagnosis. This relation was observed among both premenopausal and postmenopausal patients. Dietary fat was not related to the estrogen receptor status of tumors. No association was found between dietary habits and histologic features of the primary tumor. These data suggest that dietary fat may have an effect on the growth or spread of breast cancer during the preclinical phase of the disease and that this effect may vary according to the type of fat considered."

            "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and constitutes 18% of all cancers in women. Female gender, age and country of birth are the strongest determinants of disease risk. Family history and mutations in tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are important correlates of lifetime risk. Genetic polymorphisms associated with estrogen synthesis and metabolism are viewed as major factors in breast cancer prevalence in specific populations. Atypical hyperplasia and ductal/lobular carcinoma in situ although uncommon, are considered as pre-malignant conditions as well as markers for invasive breast cancer. Lately, increased bone density and high breast tissue density on mammogram in postmenopausal women have been reported in association with increased risk of breast carcinoma, probably attributable to increased levels of endogenous estrogen. Serum estrogen levels are higher in breast cancer cases as compared with controls. Current use of oral contraceptives and prolonged, current or recent use of postmenopausal hormonal replacement therapy are also considered as risk factors for breast cancer. Tamoxifen and raloxifene, selective estrogen receptor modulators, were shown to reduce breast cancer risk among high-risk women. Various nutrients were evaluated for their possible effect on breast cancer risk but further studies are needed. High socioeconomic status is found to be associated with increased risk of breast malignancy for as yet unestablished reasons. Studying breast cancer risk factors and further research into the molecular etiology of the disease will enable early diagnosis and detection of high-risk women and ultimately improve prognosis."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The multistep molecular model of breast carcinogenesis is based on the oestrogen receptor(ER) status of the tumour. Its two main arms comprise ER-positive and ER-negative breast carcinomas(BCa), which are associated with Nottingham grade(NG) of the tumour and different proliferative epithelial changes. According to the model, columnar cell lesions(CCL), lobular carcinoma in-situ(LCIS) and atypical ductal hyperplasia(ADH), low-grade ductal carcinoma in-situ (LG-DCIS) are associated with low grade ER-positive tumours and microglandular adenosis (MGA), pleomorphic LCIS(PLCIS), high-grade DCIS(HG-DCIS) are associated with ER-negative high grade tumours. This study aims to describe the association between proliferative epithelial changes in breast tissue adjacent to tumour, in relation to the ER status and NG of the tumour.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This descriptive cross-sectional study included 420, wide local excision and mastectomy specimens of BCa from National Hospital of Sri Lanka, between 2017-2019. The histopathological features of the tumour and proliferative epithelial changes in tumour adjacent tissue within 10 mm distance from the tumour-host interface were evaluated independently by two pathologists. The ER, PR(Progesterone receptor) and HER2 status assessed by immunohistochemistry(IHC) was reviewed. The associations between above epithelial lesions and ER status and NG{categorised as low grade (NG1 and NG2) and high grade (NG3)} of the tumour were analyzed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      ER positive BCa showed significant associations with CCH (p = 0.04), FEA (p = 0.035) and LGDCIS (p < 0.001). Although PLCIS was more frequent in ER positive tumours, the association did not attain statistical significance. ER negative BCa showed a significant association with HGDCIS (p = 0.016). CCLs as a whole (p = 0.005) and also CCC (p = 0.006) and FEA (p = 0.048) and LGDCIS (p < 0.001) showed significant associations with low NG tumours. High NG tumours showed a significant association with HGDCIS (p < 0.001). Microglandular adenosis was not identified in our study population.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These morphological findings support the multistep molecular based pathogenetic pathways of breast carcinoma in the studied setting in South Asia. Identification of these proliferative epithelial components in a core biopsy that is negative for BCa, should prompt for close clinicoradiological correlation, and if necessary re-biopsy of women suspected of harbouring a BCa."

We assessed psychosocial needs and correlates in women initiating testing for high genetic BC risk in clinics in France and Germany, and compared these results with data from a literature review. Among the 442 counselees consecutively approached, 212 (83%) in France and 180 (97%) in Germany, mostly BC patients (81% and 92%, respectively), returned the 'Psychosocial Assessment in Hereditary Cancer' questionnaire. Based on the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) BC risk estimation model, the mean BC lifetime risk estimates were 19% and 18% in France and Germany, respectively. In both countries, the most prevalent needs clustered around the \"living with cancer\" and \"children-related issues\" domains. In multivariate analyses, a higher number of psychosocial needs were significantly associated with younger age (b = -0.05), higher anxiety (b = 0.78), and having children (b = 1.51), but not with country, educational level, marital status, depression, or loss of a family member due to hereditary cancer. These results are in line with the literature review data. However, this review identified only seven studies that quantitatively addressed psychosocial needs in the BC genetic counseling setting. Current data lack understandings of how cancer risk counseling affects psychosocial needs, and improves patient-centered care in that setting."

This clinical conundrum is exemplified by rhabdoid meningiomas, which are designated in the World Health Organization Classification of Tumours as high grade, despite only a subset following an aggressive clinical course. Patient management decisions are further exacerbated by high rates of interobserver variability, biased against missing possibly aggressive tumors.

It is characterized by well-defined borders, a syncytial/solid pattern of growth of high grade atypical cells showing no glandular differentiation and a massive diffuse lympho-plasmacytic peritumoral infiltrate. Despite the high-grade atypias characterizing this neoplasm, MBC has been reported to have a better prognosis when compared with the common infiltrating duct carcinoma. MBCs typically lack estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PgR) expression and have a low incidence of ERBB2 overexpression. Genetically, they are often associated with BRCA-1 oncogene mutations and TP53 alterations.

A positive family history of breast carcinoma adds to the increased risk that is associated with breast cystic disease. Biochemical analysis of breast cystic disease fluid shows a unique protein profile. GCDFP-15 (gross cystic disease fluid protein) in breast cystic disease fluid is also found by immunoperoxidase staining to be present in approximately 50% of all breast carcinomas Enhanced production of GCDFP-15 by breast carcinomas has been shown experimentally and clinically with the use of androgens.

It is estimated that 25% of families meeting the criteria for hereditary diffuse gastric carcinoma (HDCG) will have germline mutations in the E-cadherin gene. Evidence suggests that stomach cancer might also be a malignant manifestation of other inherited predispositions to disease. Recently, it has been reported that the incidence of stomach cancer is significantly increased in BRCA2 gene mutation carriers. We analysed by direct sequencing the BRCA2 gene in 29 breast cancer patients derived from 29 families with an aggregation of at least one female breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 50 years and one male stomach cancer diagnosed before the age of 55 years. In all but one of these families at least one additional relative was also affected by a malignant tumour. We identified three frameshift mutations and three sequence variants - potentially missense mutations, in six unrelated patients representing 20.7% (six out of 29) of the families investigated. Our results confirm that BRCA2 gene mutations are also associated with familial aggregations of not only breast but also of stomach cancer. In comparison to the number of cancers expected in the study population compared to the general population there is an over-representation of several cancers with significant confidence intervals to suggest that the associations are real and not a selection artefact."

The multivariate Cox analysis showed that age group (<or=35 years vs >35 years, p=0.01; Hazard Ratio [HR], 15.4; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.8-133.0), tumor size (>1 cm vs <or=1 cm, p=0.002; HR,3.5; CI:1.2-13.4) and LVI (yes vs no, p=0.002; HR,34.7; CI:3.6-326.0) were strongly associated with DM. From this analysis, a risk estimation model for DM was constructed. Whereas patients at low risk had a 96% distant metastasis-free survival, this rate for those at high risk had a 37% (p<0.00001). According to the proposed model including age, tumor size and LVI, the patients at high risk might benefit from adjuvant systemic therapy."

            "abstract": "Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is the breast cancer subtype defined by gene profiling and generates keen clinical interest. Immunohistochemical panels using basal cytokeratins and epidermal growth factor receptor are widely adopted for its identification. Nonetheless, there are concerns about the risk for missing some true BLBCs. Both P-cadherin and vimentin have been proposed as BLBC markers, but their usefulness for BLBC classification has not been well documented. In this study, we evaluated by immunohistochemistry their expression in a large cohort of breast carcinoma. Cancers expressing vimentin or P-cadherin showed BLBC-related morphological features (high grade, presence of necrosis, and lymphocytic infiltration; P < .001 for all except P = .006 for vimentin with lymphocytic infiltration) and immunohistochemical profile (P < .001 for all markers tested except P = .007 for vimentin with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). Concordantly, they were significantly associated with BLBC (P < .001 for both). Nonetheless, they did not appear to be good stand-alone BLBC markers. Compared with the commonly used reference panel, the specificity (95.9%) and sensitivity (43.1%) of coexpression of vimentin and P-cadherin were better than most single markers or their combinations tested. Moreover, their coexpression was significantly associated with basal features in non-BLBCs and worse disease-free survival in triple-negative breast cancers (hazard ratio, 2.232; P = .027). This raised the possibility that the vimentin and P-cadherin combination can be used to identify BLBC especially those that were missed by the commonly used basal cytokeratins and epidermal growth factor receptor panel. Together, P-cadherin and vimentin could be adjunctive to the commonly used immunohistochemical surrogates for BLBC identification."

Traditional prognostic indicators (age, tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, sites of recurrence, disease free interval [DFI], adjuvant treatments, estrogen receptor [ER] expression, progesterone receptor [PgR] expression, S-phase fraction [SPF], and DNA ploidy), together with three newer biologic markers (c-erbB-2, p53, and bcl-2) were assessed.

            "abstract": "Compelling experimental and clinical data support the concept that breast carcinoma, as most of the other solid tumors, needs to develop the angiogenic phenotype for invasiveness, progression and metastasis. Several studies have determined intratumoral microvessel density by panendothelial markers and immunohistochemical techniques, with most of them showing that the degree of vascularity is associated with prognosis of the patients operated of early-stage invasive breast cancer. More recently, certain angiogenic peptides have been assessed in human breast cancer: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived-endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF, also known as thymidine phosphorylase, TP) and fibroblast growth factor family (FGFs). Among these, the most studied is VEGF, which appears to be a powerful prognostic indicator. Little data are available on the clinical significance of naturally occurring antiangiogenic factors, with few studies reporting on interleukin-12 and thrombospondins. In vivo techniques for dynamic assessment of tumor blood network are presently under extensive research, in particular for monitoring activity of inhibitors of angiogenesis. The methods of assessment of angiogenic activity and the results of published clinical studies in peer reviewed Journals with a computerized overview of literature will be presented. Overall, the results of the reported studies suggest that human breast cancer is an angiogenic-dependent tumor for which antiangiogenic therapy represents a promising novel antitumoral therapeutic strategy."

In exponentially growing cells Ki-S1 showed a marked cell cycle phase-specific variation in staining intensity which increased linearly through the S-phase, was high in G2 and reached its peak in mitosis. Ki-S1 staining intensity mirrored the changes in proliferative activity of ZR75 cells during serum deprivation and refeeding. In a small series of human breast carcinoma, Ki-S1 staining intensity correlated with S-phase fraction (SPF) derived from DNA profiles. The antigen labelled by Ki-S1 is extremely robust, resisting degradation by fixation and by an aggressive enzymic tissue disaggregation method. Ki-S1 warrants further investigation as a proliferation-related marker, particularly for routine clinical application."

            "abstract": "The prognostic significance of conventional TNM staging remains the standard for determining prognosis in breast carcinoma. The presence (or absence) of axillary lymph node metastases remains the single most important parameter for predicting patient outcome. The presence of regional lymph node metastases implies that the primary tumor has the capacity for successfully completing the steps of the metastatic cascade. However, the absence of regional lymph node metastases does not ensure that distant or systemic seeding of tumor cells has not occurred, only that it is less likely. Staging data appear to be refined by addition of several standard morphological parameters. Although there is considerable overlap and interaction between these factors, as well as with staging data, there is strong evidence that grade, necrosis, inflammatory cell \"immune response,\" and possibly pattern of invasion and intravascular tumor each independently supplement staging information. Some data appear to have independent significance only when applied to specific patient subsets, raising serious question as to their biologic importance. Nevertheless, morphological data are subjective and susceptible to observer variation and have less statistical power in predicting patient outcome than staging data. It was initially thought that DNA analysis of breast cancer by flow cytometry might supplant morphological data in assessing tumor behavior. The following conclusions can now be drawn: (1) there is no clear association between aneuploidy and SPF and stage; (2) aneuploid tumors are associated with higher SPF and shorter disease-free survival while diploid-range tumors generally have lower SPF and longer disease-free survival; (3) aneuploid DNA content is significantly associated with markers of decreased morphological (grade) and biochemical (ER status) differentiation. Determination of S-phase fraction by FCM appears to be a rapid and potentially easy method for obtaining kinetic information on individual breast tumors, although the technology for improving the accuracy of SPF measurements is still under development (e.g., tumor cell gating, debris subtraction). SPF appears to be comparable to other kinetic measurements, such as TLI, and shows many of the same associations with morphological and clinical data as ploidy. This is due to the close association of ploidy and SPF. Which of these parameters is more important for predicting patient outcome has not been clearly defined. Additional technological refinements for determining SPF may result in a more prominent prognostic role for this measurement. Three problems have limited our ability to draw specific conclusions about the biologic significance of tumor ploidy and SPF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Grading of breast carcinoma, while the tumour is still in vivo, would be the most ideal and desirable situation, as it would be helpful in the selection of appropriate therapy for the patient. This study was undertaken with the aim to determine the grade of DCC, NOS by simple cytological scoring system as a method of predicting histological grade. We selected 80 cases of DCC, NOS which were initially diagnosed by Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) with subsequent histological confirmation. For cytological grading Papanicolou's stained smears and for histological grading Haematoxylin and Eosin stained sections were examined under light microscope. For histological grading Scraff Bloom Richardson's grading and for cytological grading Robinson's grading were followed. In both system grading were grade I, grade II and grade III of DCC, NOS. On cytological grading 39 (48.8%) cases were grade-I, 38 (47.5%) cases were grade-II and 3 (3.8%) cases were grade-III. On histological grading 33 (41.3%) cases were grade-I, 39 (48.8%) cases were grade-II and 8 (10%) cases were grade-III.

This study was performed to evaluate whether immunostaining of these proteins correlated with the proliferative potential of meningiomas as evaluated by clinicopathologic features.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Immunohistochemical staining of ER-D5, ER, and PR were performed on paraffin embedded sections of meningiomas from 34 patients.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty two (64.7%) of the 34 meningiomas tested were positive for ER-D5 with exclusively cytoplasmic immunostaining. All of the cases were positive for PR but not for ER. Progesterone receptors in meningiomas were cytoplasmic and/or nuclear. The correlation of ER-D5 reactivity with histologic subtypes showed positivity rates for meningotheliomatous meningiomas of 71.4%, fibroblastic 41.7%, transitional 80%, anaplastic 100% and hemangiopericytic 100%. ER-D5 positivity rates in primary and recurrent meningiomas were 59.3% and 85.7%, respectively. Normal arachnoid tissue was positive for PR but negative for ER-D5 and ER. Patient age and sex has no significant influence on the positivity rate of meningiomas. The mean number of AgNORs in ER-D5-positive and -negative meningiomas had no statistical significance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study suggests that ER-D5 has some role in the growth of the meningioma and that the expression of ER-D5 in human meningioma is independent of ER as it is in breast cancer. The localization of PR in the meningioma cells indicate that at least some of these cells are functionally active."

            "abstract": "The role of the stromal constituents in the natural history of breast cancers is still poorly defined. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of proteoglycan versican, a constituent of desmoplastic stroma of invasive carcinomas, in preinvasive breast lesions. We selected 41 cases of breast carcinoma: 28 pure in situ lesions and 13 invasive lesions with in situ-associated lesions. The study provided evidence that versican is strongly expressed in the perilesional stroma of a subclass of ductal in situ carcinomas, and that the extension of versican immunostaining is statistically related to the high grade (G3) category (54% of diffuse expressors; p=0.01), and with a comedo pattern (67% of diffuse expressors, p=0.003). On the other hand, the expression of versican in the cases of classic lobular in situ carcinomas that we selected for the study was confined to the anatomical structures that usually contain the proteoglycan in adult breast tissues. In our cohort, versican synthesis was found to be associated with spindle-shaped elements with myofibroblastic phenotype, as in the stroma of invasive carcinoma. These data, taken together with evidence from previous studies on proteins strongly related to versican, suggest that various histotypes of breast in situ carcinomas could follow different pathways of epithelial stromal interactions. In particular a category of in situ lesions shows constituents of desmoplastic stroma before the manifestation of the morphological signs of invasion. Study of the connective tissue modifications that trigger the pivotal phase of invasion could provide new prospects in oncology."

            "abstract": "The specimen excised for the mammographically detected lesion is somewhat unique and requires special consideration by the surgical pathologist. The biopsy, in most instances, contains no grossly visible lesion and is relatively large so that blocking in its entirety is not practical. The pathologist needs to establish that the radiological abnormality is contained in the biopsy and to this end specimen radiography is required. Established prognostic parameters for breast carcinoma, such as tumor size, histological type, grade and hormone receptor status are equally applicable in the non-palpable breast lesion but consideration should also be given to the identification of epithelial proliferations which have increased risk for subsequent carcinoma. In addition, the recognition of ductal carcinoma in situ in the biopsy indicates potential for widespread disease, and lobular carcinoma in situ, a less commonly detected lesion in mammography, is associated with multifocality and disease in the contra-lateral breast. Both lesions are also associated with increased risk of recurrence in the remaining breast tissue. Failure to observe the corresponding quantity of calcium seen in radiographs relates to the fact that calcium may occur, not only as calcium phosphate, but also as calcium oxalate, the latter not being stained by hematoxylin and eosin but readily detected by its birefringent nature in polarized light. Detailed correlation of serial thin slices of the specimen with radiographic features is largely an educational exercise but is the most time-consuming step in the examination of the non-palpable breast lesion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Invasive breast cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as the most common malignancy among Israeli women. Over 3,800 Israeli women are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer every year and around 3400 women are diagnosed with breast carcinoma in-situ. Although smoking, either active or passive, is a controversial risk factor for breast cancer, cigarette smoking involves exposure to substrates of the NAT2 gene. The NAT2 genotype may modify the risk of cancer by activating or detoxifying heterocyclic and aromatic amines. Identification of a potential, modifiable risk factor for common and serious disease is very important for prevention and identification of high risk groups. This literature review aims to describe published studies and increase attention to measures of exposure to tobacco smoke, as well as to aspects of the NAT2 genotype that may modify the association between passive smoking and breast cancer risk. The results suggest that the NAT2 status has a differential effect on the association of active and passive smoking with breast cancer and demonstrates the need to consider possible different mechanisms associated with exposure to main and side-stream tobacco smoke. However, methodological limitations, such as small sample size, and varying definitions of smoking, are likely to have contributed to the inconsistent findings."

Immunohistochemistry was applied on paraffin-embedded sections from 164 patients with invasive breast carcinomas to detect the expression of the proteins pSmad2, ER, PR, Ki67, topoisomerase IIa, ERK2, catenin-p120, MMP-14 and TIMP-2. pSmad2 protein was detected in the nuclei of the malignant cells (68.1%) and in the tumor fibroblasts (55.2%). Nuclear pSmad2 was inversely correlated with histological grade and LN (p=0.047 and p=0.05) as well as with Ki67 and topoIIa (p=0.003 and p=0.021, respectively). There was also an inverse relation between nuclear pSmad2 and normal immunoexpression of the adhesion molecule catenin-p120 (p=0.028). Both nuclear and stromal pSmad2 were positively correlated with ERK2 of tumor fibroblasts (p=0.008 and p=0.0001, respectively), while stromal pSmad2 was furthermore related to stromal MMP-14 and tumor TIMP-2 (p=0.006 and p=0.022, respectively). Patients with high expression of cancerous pSmad2 tended to have a better prognosis, although statistic significance was never reached. pSmad2 was found to play a dual role, according to its distribution.

The investigation was based on the recorded underlying and contributory causes of death in the Swedish Register of Causes of Death. The observed number of deaths due to various main disease groups was compared with the expected number calculated for an age-matched general population. A 21 per cent increase of intercurrent deaths was observed (95% confidence limits: 13-29%, p less than 0.001). Excess risks were found due to circulatory diseases, other tumours, 'accidents, suicides and injuries' and infectious diseases. The excess risk increased with time during follow-up and in the period 10 to 21 years it was 35 per cent (17-55%, p less than 0.001). These findings could be interpreted as an association between breast carcinoma and other diseases but might also to some extent have been caused by diagnostic errors or errors in the ascertainment of underlying versus contributory causes of death. It is concluded, however, that such possible errors are probably not a major source of bias in judging the mortality trend for the disease during the period encompassed by the investigation. This conclusion was based on the circumstance that the observed excess risks were of equal magnitude during the first ten years of follow-up in both the 1961-1963 and 1971-1973 series."

In the 6th and 7th editions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual are evaluated the nodal metastases based on size and taking into account the number of metastatic cells. According to these Manuals, a positive node is equated to metastasis whose size reaches at least 0.2 mm or amounting to more than 200 tumor cells. The clinical significance and the therapeutic optimum of the presence of a minimal nodal involvement after axillary sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) biopsy remain controversial. The need for further axillary treatment (ALN dissection or axillary radiation) in clinical N0 patients with early-stage breast carcinoma and SLNs metastases remains unclear. In all likelihood, the delivery of the regular adjuvant treatment in association with systemic treatment and radiation therapy results in survival rates similar to axillary treatment completion. This review also presents several assessment methods related to the SLNs at the surgical stage, such as cytological, histological, immunohistochemical and molecular diagnostic techniques, evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of each of them.

Three of these studies reported significant associations, with relative risk estimates mostly between 1.5 and 2.0. The other study reported relative risk point estimates near 1.5, but confidence intervals included 1.0. The current study was a population-based, retrospective cohort analysis that evaluated the risk of subsequent breast carcinoma in women who were diagnosed with meningioma and the risk of subsequent meningioma in women who were diagnosed with breast carcinoma.\n## METHODS\nThe measure of association is the relative risk and is reported as the standardized incidence ratio (SIR). Using western Washington State cancer registry data and intercensal population estimates for western Washington State, incidence rates of second primary tumor were compared between identified meningioma and breast carcinoma cohorts and the general population for the years 1992-1998.\n## RESULTS\nThe risk of breast carcinoma after patients were diagnosed with meningioma (SIR) was 1.54 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.77-2.75). The risk of meningioma after patients were diagnosed with breast carcinoma was 1.40 (95% CI, 0.67-2.58), and the risk of meningioma after patients were diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma was 1.64 (95% CI, 0.79-3.02). In each combination for age groups ages > 50 years, risks were elevated, but the confidence intervals included 1.0.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results suggest that the risk of meningioma among women who have experienced breast carcinoma and the risk of breast carcinoma among women who have experienced meningioma are elevated moderately. Shared risk factors may account for the relatively week bidirectional associations seen in this and other studies.\n"

Cases were regarded as positive for individual antibodies when at least 10% of the DCIS cells showed positive staining. DCIS was graded histologically as well (n = 9), intermediately (n = 24), or poorly differentiated (n = 75). bcl-2 expression was documented in 57 cases (53%) and was strongly associated with the histological grade of DCIS (P < 0.0001). All cases of well-differentiated DCIS were bcl-2 positive and loss of bcl-2 expression was almost exclusively confined to poorly differentiated DCIS lesions. bcl-2 expression was also closely associated with positive ER status (P < 0.0001). Forty-seven of 57 (82%) bcl-2 positive cases were ER positive while 49/51 (96%) bcl-2 negative cases were ER negative. There was a significant inverse correlation between bcl-2 expression and both p53 protein expression (P = 0.0004) and c-erbB-2 expression (P < 0.0001). Nineteen of 24 (79%) p53 positive cases and 38/45 (84%) c-erbB-2 positive cases showed loss of bcl-2.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Loss of bcl-2 expression occurs in poorly differentiated DCIS and is related to negative ER status and to positive p53 and c-erbB-2 status. This pattern of bcl-2 expression and its association with other biological markers in DCIS is similar to that reported in invasive breast carcinoma."

Genetic susceptibility to meningioma is well established, with the risk among relatives of meningioma patients being approximately threefold higher than that in the general population.

Alteration of the p53 gene causes down-regulation of the expression of thrombospondin-1, a natural inhibitor of angiogenesis. This study was conducted to investigate the association between mutant p53 protein and VEGF expression, and the prognostic value of these factors. VEGF165 and p53 protein were measured in tumour cytosols by enzyme immunoassays. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated in 833 consecutive patients, 485 node-negative (NNBC) and 348 node-positive (NPBC) with primary invasive breast cancer. A significant association was found between mutant p53 protein and VEGF expression. Univariate analysis showed both p53 and VEGF to be significant predictors of survival. Similar correlation was seen when p53 was combined with VEGF. Univariate analysis of NNBC showed significant prognostic value of p53 for OS, also when combined with VEGF expression; for NPBC, significant reductions in RFS and OS were seen for p53-positive patients, and these findings were enhanced when combined with VEGF, also in the sub-group receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment. Multivariate analysis showed both p53 and VEGF as independent predictors of OS in all groups. When the 2 factors were combined, an increased relative risk of 2.7 was seen for OS in the group with both p53 positivity and high VEGF content, as compared with 1.7 in the group with one risk factor. The results suggest an association between loss of wt-p53 and increased VEGF expression, indicating that angiogenic activity may depend, at least partly, on altered p53-protein function. Combination of these 2 biological markers appears to give additional predictive information of survival. A high-risk group of patients was associated with p53 positivity and higher VEGF content."

All 760 patients analyzed relapsed with at least one metastasis, and were studied retrospectively with no selection criteria according to any specific protocol. All had recorded clinical data on menopause, stage, clinical tumor aggressiveness (PEV), initial chemo or hormonal therapy, and time to relapse, and had ongoing follow up at our Center, with salvage chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy having been given to some but not all patients. A brief metastasis-free survival (p less than 0.000001), and factors associated with electing pre-relapse chemotherapy (p less than 0.000001) were associated with shortened post-relapse survival, while post-relapse therapy (chemo p less than 0.0001, and hormonal p less than 0.00001, replacing chemotherapy in the model) apparently increased post-relapse survival in the group overall. This result was similar in the inoperable patient group [with inflammatory breast carcinoma an additional risk factor (p less than 0.0005)], as well as the operable group. However, in the operable group, when the pathologic criteria of histologic grade and nodal status were introduced into the analysis, post-relapse therapy was not seen to be an important factor for survival in any subgroup.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Median lymphatic and blood microvessel densities, as well as VEGF expression, were related to each other and to clinicopathologic parameters including lymph node (LN) status. The efficacy of haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) in detecting lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI) compared to D2-40 immunostaining was also investigated. D2-40 stained normal lymphatic endothelium and myoepithelial cells, but with different staining patterns. D2-40 LVD related significantly to CD31 counts (r=0.470; p=0.002), and LN metastasis (Mann-Whitney U=101.500; p=0.043); however, it did not relate to age, tumor grade, tumor size or LVI. D2-40 identified LVI in 3 more cases (7.5%) than those detected by H&E. VEGF was expressed in 85%of cases, and was significantly related to CD31 and D2-40 counts (p=0.033 and 0.007, respectively). In conclusion, D2-40 LVD showed a significant association with LN metastasis, and can be considered to segregate patients with positive from those with negative LNs. D2-40 enhances the detection of LVI relative to H&E staining reflecting a potential for lymphatic metastatic spread and possible poor prognosis."

Although early diagnosis has contributed to therapeutic success, breast cancer remains a major health issue. In the last few year the hormone therapy for estrogen-dependent breast cancer has evolved achieving significant clinical results; at the same time, it has enabled us to better define the role of estrogens in the etiopathogenesis of this tumour. Weight increase and obesity have been identified as the most important risk and prognostic factors for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the association of obesity with postmenopausal breast cancer. Specific obesity-associated factors, including leptin, insulin and inflammatory mediators, seem to influence breast cancer growth and prognosis independently of estrogens and at least in part by interacting with estrogen signalling at a cellular level. Therefore, a careful assessment of the nutritional status and body composition is paramount for a proper therapeutic approach for postmenopausal breast carcinoma. The use of antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory drugs associated with conventional hormone therapies and dietary/physical interventions could offer a new therapeutic approach for breast carcinoma that develops in the context of adiposity."

            "abstract": "The great majority of breast carcinomas arising in postmenopausal women are estrogen dependent or positive for estrogen receptor (ER) in carcinoma cells despite markedly low plasma or circulating estrogen concentrations. In these patients, biologically active estrogens are locally produced from circulating inactive steroids including adrenal androgens in an intracrine mechanism in the breast cancer tissues and confer estrogenic activities on carcinoma cells. A series of enzymes are involved in this intra-tumoral or in situ production of estrogens in breast carcinoma tissues but aromatase, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, is a key enzyme of estrogen production through conversion from circulating adrenal androgens in estrogen-dependent postmenopausal breast cancer. It then becomes important to identify the sites of this estrogen production. There has been, however, controversy regarding intra-tumoral localization of aromatase in breast carcinoma, especially whether intra-tumoral production of estrogens through aromatase occurs in carcinoma or stromal cells. The enzyme was demonstrated to be expressed in both carcinoma and stromal cells in breast carcinoma tissues on immunohistochemistry with a well-characterized mAb 677 and combined laser capture microdissection/qualitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Intra-tumoral aromatase in both of these cell types was subsequently demonstrated to be induced by carcinoma-stromal interactions associated with carcinoma invasion in breast tissue. The signals through various nuclear receptors, especially estrogen-related receptor-alpha in carcinoma cells and liver receptor homologue-1 in adipocytes adjacent to carcinoma invasion, in conjunction with various cytokines and/or growth factors, play pivotal roles in this induction of intra-tumoral aromatase. This increased aromatase subsequently results in increased in situ estrogen concentrations of breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors are currently established as the gold standard for the treatment for ER-positive breast carcinoma but resistance to the therapy still remains to be solved by other modes of suppression of intra-tumoral estrogen production."

ER mediates growth stimulatory effects of estrogens whereas sstr2A mediates growth inhibitory actions of somatostatin. However, much work has been devoted to elucidate the biological role of ER, little is known about sstr2A in breast cancer. In the present study we examined immunoreactivity of sstr2A and ER in 64 breast carcinomas in correlation with tumor size and histological grade (HG), presence of lymph node metastasis (LNM), Nottingham prognostic index (NPI), and the patients' age. ER and sstr2A immunoreactivity were present in 78% and 63% of the breast carcinomas, respectively. Ninety percent of tumors immunoreactive for sstr2A were simultaneously immunoreactive for ER. ER immunoreactivity correlated significantly with lower HG (p = 0.03) and better NPI (p = 0.02). sstr2A immunoreactivity correlated significantly with lower HG (p = 0.012) but not with NPI (p = 0.26). There was no correlation of sstr2A immunoreactivity and tumor size, patients' chronological age or LNM. The results confirm prognostic value of ER immunohistochemistry in breast carcinoma. However sstr2A cannot substitute ER for prognostic evaluation, sstr2A immunoreactivity being significantly associated with lower HG seems to represent an independent prognostic factor in breast carcinoma."

While there was no difference in the distribution of oestrogen receptor (ER) status, the receptor positive showed higher values later in the year. These high values were accompanied by a lack of tubular differentiation, again in keeping with a more rapid growth rate. Grading factor 1 is thus associated with the level of receptor positivity, in contrast to receptor status which is linked to factor 2.

The increased risk associated with epigenome-wide DNA methylation in functional promoters did not vary by time between blood collection and diagnosis, whereas the inverse association with epigenome-wide DNA methylation outside functional promoters was strongest when the interval from blood collection to diagnosis was less than 5 years and weakest for the longest interval.

Breast cancer in Asia is characterized by a lower incidence than in Western populations, but is still the leading type of cancer in Asian women, and a significant increasing tread indicates that it is an issue of particular public health importance. Asian breast cancer is characterized by early tumor onset, showing a relatively younger median age at diagnosis. Recently, scientists began to explore the tumorigenic mechanisms underlying breast cancer formation at the molecular level. Both a candidate-gene approach and genome-wide association studies have yielded crucial insights into breast cancer susceptibility genes initiating breast tumorigenesis. As expected, ethnic/racial variation in the genotypic frequency of these genes results in differences in breast cancer incidence in different populations. Furthermore, the question of how important these genes are in Asian breast cancer remains to be explored. It has been demonstrated that gene expression profiles and gene sets are prognostic and predictive for patients with breast cancer. Originally, due to its early onset, it was speculated that Asian breast cancer would have a higher frequency of the basal-like subtype of breast cancer, a molecular subtype characterized by poor differentiation, resulting in a relatively poor progression; however, recent findings do not support this speculation. The frequency of the luminal-A subtype of breast cancer, characterized by estrogen receptor expression, is similar to that in breast cancer in Caucasian, supporting the usefulness of hormone-based therapy in Asian breast cancer."

Although individuals often rely on their intimate partners to provide physical and emotional support when they are in pain, the daily impact of pain on the spousal relationship in the context of advanced cancer is unclear. To understand how relationships are affected by pain, 57 MBC patients and their partners completed electronic diary assessments 6 times a day for 14 days. Patients and partners rated the patient's pain, their own mood (circumplex adjectives), the provision/receipt of social support, and the degree to which cancer interfered with their relationship. Multilevel mediation models with the couple as the unit of analysis were estimated. Partners and patients reported greater relationship interference when patients experienced more pain and less aroused (i.e., more tired, less peppy, less active) mood. Greater tired mood during the day accounted for 17% and 82% of the association between patients' morning pain and their evening ratings of emotional and physical support from their partners, respectively. Partners did not directly respond to patients' pain by providing emotional or physical support; however, they were more likely to provide support when patients experienced more tired and less active mood as a consequence of their pain. Results suggest that one way that pain may wear on couples' relationships is through its adverse effects on patients' daily mood. They also suggest that partners may base their provision of support on their perception of the adverse effects of pain on patients' aroused mood."

            "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is a complex and multifactorial disease, and environmental factors have been suggested to increase its risk. However, prior research has largely focused on studying exposures to one factor/contaminant at a time, which does not reflect the real-world environment.Methods: Herein, we investigate associations between breast cancer and the environmental quality index (EQI), a comprehensive assessment of five domains of environmental quality (air, water, land, sociodemographic, and built environments) at the county level. Breast cancer diagnoses for North Carolina women were obtained from the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry (2009-2014) and the county of residence at the time of diagnosis was linked with the EQI. We evaluated the odds of localized, regional, or distant metastatic breast cancer in categories of environmental quality using women with carcinoma in situ as registry-based controls.Results: Overall environmental quality was generally not associated with invasive breast cancer; however, all breast cancer types tended to be inversely associated with land quality, particularly in more rural communities [distant metastatic breast cancer was 5%-8% more likely (OR, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.14; P = 0.02) compared with carcinoma in situ].Conclusions: Cumulatively, our results suggest that some broad measures of environmental quality are associated with invasive breast cancer but that associations vary by environmental domain, cancer stage, subtype, and urbanicity.Impact: Our findings suggest that components of land quality (e.g., pesticide applications and animal facilities) warrant additional investigation in relation to invasive breast cancer.See all articles in this CEBP Focus section, \"Environmental Carcinogenesis: Pathways to Prevention.\""

This association has been recognized previously but has not been documented in detail. This study describes the characteristics of the components present in each case and discusses the existing literature. This observation adds further evidence to support an association between some types of invasive breast carcinoma and sclerosing lesions of the breast.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      Four of these cases were received as referral cases for opinion. The fifth was received as part of the routine surgical workload within our own institution. Two patients presented following mammographic screening and three symptomatically; their mean age was 62 years (range 49-68). The mean lesion size was 16 mm (range 7-24). All five lesions showed features of a complex sclerosing lesion/radial scar in the form of central sclerosis with elastosis and radiating benign entrapped tubules. One had associated benign papillary structures and two had focal benign squamous metaplasia. Four cases showed coexisting but distinct areas of low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma with glandular and squamous epithelial differentiation in a spindle cell background. One case had associated undifferentiated spindle cell carcinoma. Detailed immunophenotypic characteristics of two cases are presented.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This series illustrates a postulated but previously unconfirmed association between an unusual form of metaplastic breast carcinoma (adenosquamous carcinoma) and complex sclerosing lesions. The mechanisms of induction of breast carcinoma are poorly understood but these observations further emphasize the potential for sclerosing lesion of the breast to be associated with, and possibly give rise to, invasive carcinoma of different types. The precise nature of the interaction between the pathological processes remains unclear."

Since NO is known to influence apoptosis and angiogenesis we also determined the apoptotic index of the tumor cells by the TUNEL method and tumor angiogenesis by immunostaining the sections with FVIII-related antigen and assessing the number of positively stained vessels. Respectively, 65% and 11% of the cases expressed cytoplasmic positivity for eNOS and nNOS. The mean apoptotic index of the tumors was 0.60%. eNOS or nNOS expression did not associate with the apoptotic index (p=0.36 and p=0.58, respectively). Cases with a positive estrogen or progesterone receptor status were significantly more often eNOS positive than receptor negative cases (p=0.012 and p=0.015, respectively). No association was found between the estrogen or progesterone receptor status and nNOS expression. Neither eNOS nor nNOS expression was associated with vascular density, tumor grade or the TNM status of the tumors. The results show that eNOS and nNOS are expressed in breast carcinomas possibly contributing to their NO synthesis. No association with apoptosis or angiogenesis was detected. eNOS expression was, however, associated with the positive estrogen and progesterone receptors status suggesting that its synthesis might be regulated by hormonal stimulation."

We report an inverse correlation of steady-state Thbs-1 mRNA and protein expression with malignant progression among murine melanoma and human lung and breast carcinoma cell lines. Murine K-1735 melanoma cell lines of low metastatic potential, including K-1735 lines transfected with the murine nm23-1 cDNA, expressed higher TSP levels than related highly metastatic lines. In a model system of lung carcinoma malignant progression, immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells expressed higher TSP levels than v-Ki-ras, v-Ha-ras or n-ras transfectants, which in turn expressed higher TSP levels than tumor-derived, more aggressive variants. Among 3 unrelated breast carcinoma cell lines, Thbs-1 steady-state mRNA levels were greater in the 2 non-metastatic lines than the metastatic line. Our data show that malignant progression in some cell lines is associated with reduced TSP expression. The suppressive effects of nm23-1 transfection on metastatic potential are also associated with increased TSP expression; ras transfection, which results in increased tumorigenesis, is associated with decreased TSP expression."

Detection of these proteins was provided by using indirect enzymatic immunohistochemistry. Our findings were compared with the other clinical and pathological parameters: expression of Her2/neu, estrogen receptor status (ER), progesteron receptor status (PR), histological grade and regional lymph node status. For statistical analysis, non-parametric two sided Mann-Whitney-U test was used. Majority of breast carcinoma specimens show positivity for these proteins. The MDR1 and MRP1 signal was found in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. The expression of LRP was detected in the cytoplasm close to the nuclear membrane. The samples were positive for MDR1 protein in 57%, for MRP1 in 84% and for LRP in 79%. Comparing our results with other clinical and pathological parameters, negative correlation between ER, PR and MDR1 expressions and histological grading status was found. No associations were observed between the MRP1 and LRP proteins and histological grading, as well as between the expression of three MDR proteins and the other clinically relevant parameters. In conclusion, high frequency of expression of MDR proteins in breast carcinoma cells suggests, that these proteins might be an important factor of drug resistance in breast carcinoma. Nevertheless, the negative correlation between the histological grade of malignancy of tumor and the expression of ER, PR and MDR1 indicates possible influence of progressive tumor cell de-differentiation. However, this finding has to be confirmed in additional evaluations."

This study investigated 65 invasive, 50 in situ and 19 benign hyperplastic breast lesions for its immunohistochemical expression. MnSOD expression was also tested with in situ hybridization. To study cell proliferation, apoptosis and their association with MnSOD expression the neoplastic breast lesions were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody to Ki-67 and the extent of apoptosis in them was determined by the TUNEL method. 32/65 (49%) of the invasive ductal carcinomas, 41/50 (82%) of the in situ and 15/19 (79%) of the benign hyperplasias expressed the MnSOD protein. There were significantly more MnSOD positive cases in in situ carcinoma and in benign hyperplasia than in invasive carcinoma (p=0.00016 and p=0.022, respectively). Positivity was also more frequently found in non-neoplastic ductal and acinar epithelial cells than in invasive carcinoma. On the other hand, neoplastic epithelial cells of invasive and in situ carcinoma showed strong positivity more often than the epithelial cells of benign hyperplasia or non-neoplastic epithelium. In breast lesions, MnSOD positivity did not associate with proliferation or apoptosis. The lower frequency of MnSOD positive cases in invasive breast carcinoma suggests that the lack of its expression might contribute to the development of an invasive breast carcinoma phenotype and that it could in this way operate as a tumour suppressor gene, as previously suggested."

We found that methylation levels in all markers were correlated between sisters (Spearman correlation coefficients ranged from 0.17 to 0.55). Sat2 methylation was statistically significantly associated with increased breast cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.09-4.03; for each unit decrease in the natural log of the methylation level, OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 0.88-5.11 for the lowest quartile compared with the highest quartile]. These associations were only observed in total WBC but not granulocyte DNA. There was no association between breast cancer and LINE-1 and Alu methylation.

Improved survival in breast cancer patients has resulted in their quality of life (QOL) becoming an important issue. Identifying determinants for QOL may provide insights into how to improve their living conditions. This study aimed to assess socio-demographic and clinical factors, as well as the role of self-efficacy, in relation to QOL among women with breast cancer in rural India. Methods: A total of 208 female patients with infiltrating carcinoma of the breast participated in the study. A questionnaire was administered that included sections for socio-demographic characteristics, clinical stage of the cancer and patient delay in seeking health care. A standardized instrument to measure self-efficacy was applied. To assess QOL, the WHOQOL – BREF instrument was used. Results: The overall mean score for QOL was 59.3. For domain 1 (physical health) the mean score across all groups was 55.5, for psychological health 58.2, for social relationships 63.2 and for environmental factors, 60.4. The environmental domain in QOL was negatively associated with lower education. Being divorced/widowed/unmarried had a negative association with the psychological health and social relationship dimensions, whereas higher income was positively associated with QOL parameters such as psychology, social relationships and environmental factors. Self-efficacy was positively associated with all four domains of QOL. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated a moderate QOL in women with breast cancer in rural India. Young age, lack of education and being without a partner were negatively related to QOL, and employment as casual and industrial workers, high monthly family income and higher self-efficacy were positively associated with QOL. A comprehensive public health initiative is required, including social, financial and environmental support, that can provide better QOL for breast cancer survivors."

Over the period 15 June 1990-15 June 2008, 5,956 incident breast cancer cases (including 5,245 invasive tumors) were ascertained among 89,902 women. In models adjusted for age, education, and known breast cancer risk factors, women with \"very many\" nevi had a significantly higher breast cancer risk (HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.01-1.27 versus \"none\"; ptrend = 0.04), although significance was lost after adjustment for personal history of BBD or family history of breast cancer. The 10-y absolute risk of invasive breast cancer increased from 3,749 per 100,000 women without nevi to 4,124 (95% CI = 3,674-4,649) per 100,000 women with \"very many\" nevi. The association was restricted to premenopausal women (HR = 1.40, ptrend = 0.01), even after full adjustment (HR = 1.34, ptrend = 0.03; phomogeneity = 0.04), but did not differ according to breast cancer type or hormone receptor status. In addition, we observed significantly positive dose-response relationships between number of nevi and history of biopsy-confirmed BBD (n = 5,169; ptrend<0.0001) and family history of breast cancer in first-degree relatives (n = 7,472; ptrend = 0.0003). The main limitations of our study include self-report of number of nevi using a qualitative scale, and self-reported history of biopsied BBD.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our findings suggest associations between number of nevi and the risk of premenopausal breast cancer, BBD, and family history of breast cancer. More research is warranted to elucidate these relationships and to understand their underlying mechanisms."

It is characterized by inside-out micropapillary morphology, frequent lymph vessel invasion (LVI), and lymph node metastasis; however, its etiology remains unknown. This study investigated the incomplete inside-out growth pattern (IGP) in invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified (NOS), and examined the association between incomplete IGP and clinicopathologic features, including the presence of intratumoral lymph vessels (ILV), LVI, nodal metastasis, and prognosis. Tumor tissues from 166 invasive duct carcinomas NOS and 10 IMPCs were immunostained using an anti-epithelial membrane antigen antibody to detect IGP and with D2-40 antibody to determine the presence of ILV and LVI. Incomplete IGP was detected focally in 88 (53%) of 166 invasive duct carcinomas NOS. Transition areas between IMPC and invasive duct carcinoma NOS also showed prominent incomplete IGP in 9 (90%) of 10 IMPCs. Incomplete IGP in invasive duct carcinomas NOS was associated with larger tumor size, higher frequencies of ILV, LVI, nodal metastasis, and poorer recurrence-free survival by univariate analysis. Incomplete IGP, ILV, and tumor size independently affected LVI by multivariate analysis. These findings indicate that incomplete IGP of tumor cell clusters is not uncommon and is a useful tool for predicting LVI in invasive duct carcinoma NOS of the breast."

We included in our study 35 cases of invasive breast carcinoma, which were immunostained for VEGF using monoclonal antibodies anti-VEGF clone VG1. The assessment of VEGF expression used a scoring system, which included an intensity parameter correlated with percent of positive tumor cells. We found positive correlation between ductal invasive carcinoma type of breast cancer and VEGF expression. In addition, presence of inflammation associated with breast malignancies had a significant correlation with VEGF positive staining. Because of these correlations found in our study, we concluded that VEGF could not be used as individual prognostic factor in invasive breast carcinoma."

            "abstract": "Review question/objective:\n        \n      \n      What are the psychosocial experiences of women with breast cancer across the lifespan, including similarities and differences in the psychosocial experiences of younger, middle-aged and older women with breast cancer?\n    \n\n\n          Background:\n        \n      \n      The experience of a life threatening illness, such as cancer, requires a person to consider an array of emotional, medical, social and existential demands. Specific to breast cancer, research shows that the experience of diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer may result in considerable distress.It is also known that a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer propels women into a time of uncertainty, that brings fear and emotional work. This disease oftentimes challenges a woman's identity, self-esteem, body image and relationships. However, even with these commonly felt distresses, most women adjust well to a breast cancer diagnosis and the treatments experienced, particularly if they do not experience a recurrence of cancer. Protective factors for distress include supportive care networks, such as family and support groups and professional resources provided by clinical staff, such as timely referrals to specialized services.Although most women adjust well to breast cancer, understanding distressing experiences among this population is crucial because, when experienced, the negative psychosocial impacts can be significant. Women who do experience distress due to breast cancer are at a risk of distress accompanying them through the breast cancer journey and impacting their long-term quality of life.Although literature suggests that the psychosocial experience of a breast cancer diagnosis may be different across the lifespan, less is known about the similarities and differences in the psychosocial experience between younger and older women with breast cancer. However, this studyexamines the experience of one age group and no comparisons between different age groups in this or other studies have been found at this time. Among what is known, younger women with breast cancer are at a heightened risk of anxiety and depression in comparison to older women and younger women experience more worries about their careers and finances than older women. There is also evidence that young women perceive their quality of life to be lower than older women as a result of breast cancer. This may be attributed to poorer emotional wellbeing, specific cancer-related concerns, depression and intrusive thoughts for this younger group. On the other hand, older women with breast cancer experience more health problems than younger women in survivorship, independent of receiving chemotherapy. In general, older breast cancer survivors experience overall better quality of life and mental health than their younger counterparts, but they tend to have poorer physical health and health-related quality of life due to comorbid conditions. Another risk factor for psychosocial distress is low income, which may be particularly salient for older women who are more likely to be on a fixed income than their younger counterparts. However, literature suggests that a higher degree of psychosocial adaptation can be found among older women with breast cancer because these women have had more life experience, including prior experiences with the health care system, witnessing the diagnosis of others with cancer, and having few competing demands. It is thought that these factors contributed to coping and successful adaption to the disease among older women.When studying how women acclimatize to breast cancer in the early stages of the cancer journey, it has been found that the main concerns for these women were concepts connected to identity. Breast cancer threatens women's self-integrity and the restructuring of life after a cancer diagnosis calls for the new experiences and feelings to be integrated into a revised self-narrative, sometimes referred to as 'meaning-making'. Little is understood about the differences between younger and older women in their construction of identity or how they make meaning in the context of breast cancer. What is known is that, for younger women, the diagnosis of cancer is shocking, and is an opportunity to contemplate mortality. Older women are more likely to approach their diagnoses in a matter-of-fact manner associated with the expected process of aging.The concept of body image can be found as a focus of breast cancer literature which describes the level of investment women put into their body in order to help them determine their wellbeing. The disruption of body image in breast cancer is attributed to hair loss, as well as changes in the breast and weight. Studies show younger women do seek normality in their breasts following mastectomy, and seek breast reconstruction more often than older women. Regarding older women with breast cancer, little is known about the experience of specific body image concerns, such as short- or long-term changes in the body due to treatment. It is known that older women with cancer experience body dissatisfaction and may even experience higher levels of dissatisfaction than younger women, possibly due to more persistent problems with the physical functioning of their body.It is also known that the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer affect relationships including spousal relationships, and relationships with children and older parents. As a woman with breast cancer experiences vulnerabilities, so too does her family. Spouses and partners of women with breast cancer work to adjust roles and to balance added household responsibilities, particularly during times of treatment. Children of women with breast cancer are impacted by the level of interaction with their mothers, with increased positive mother-child interactions associated with the increased wellbeing of family members. On the other hand, children are impacted negatively by a negative change in the mother's mood or marital tension. Lastly, parents of women with breast cancer are also affected since, they too, need to come to terms with the early timing of their daughters' diagnoses.Family relationships are vital for women with cancer because these relationships provide a high degree of social support, including emotional, tangible, informational and experiential support. Literature shows family relationships are improved for both younger and older breast cancer survivors. However, the intimate relationships of younger women are more likely to be strained in comparison to the intimate relationships of older women in the context of breast cancer survivorship. Also, younger adults with cancer experience increased loneliness, and a greater sense of isolation from peer and support networks than older adults perhaps because they perceive themselves to be different from their peers as a result of cancer.This incomplete understanding of the psychosocial experience of women with breast cancer across the lifespan requires an urgent need for research to facilitate a greater understanding of the psychosocial needs of these women. To allow for the effective delivery of appropriate cancer care support to these populations, a greater understanding of the unmet needs of these women must occur, including an understanding of the similarities and differences of younger and older women with this disease. A synthesis of literature from multiple contexts of the psychosocial experiences of younger and older women with breast cancer will add to the understanding of the experiences of these women. No systematic review on this topic was found when searching Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO and the JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports."

In contrast, the tumor stromal compartment showed nuclear zeb1 and twist expression in 75% and 52.4% of the cases, respectively. Although rare, nuclear expression of twist in the epithelial tumor cell compartment was associated with a poor outcome of the patients (p = 0.054 log rank, p = 0.013, Breslow, p = 0.025 Tarone-Ware). Expression of snai1, or expression of zeb1 or twist in the stromal compartment did not have any prognostic significance. Furthermore, none of these factors associated with the size of the tumors, nor with the presence of axillary or distant metastases. Expression of zeb1 and twist in the stromal compartment was positively associated with a positive estrogen or progesterone receptor status of the tumors. Stromal zeb1 expression was significantly lower in ductal in situ carcinomas than in invasive carcinomas (p = 0.020). Medullary carcinomas (p = 0.017) and mucinous carcinomas (p = 0.009) had a lower stromal expression of zeb1 than ductal carcinomas.

The women were followed until a subsequent mammogram before July 1, 2001, or a benign biopsy or breast cancer diagnosis before June 30, 2002. A total of 1,191 breast cancers (300 in situ and 891 invasive) were diagnosed during an average follow-up of 3.1 years. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimate the relative risks (RR) of in situ and invasive cancer associated with family history of breast cancer, age at first childbirth or nulliparity, post-menopausal hormone use, body mass index (BMI), and mammographic breast density. Separate analyses were done for pre- and post-menopausal women. BMI was unrelated to risk of in situ cancer regardless of menopausal status, but was associated with an increased risk of invasive cancer in post-menopausal women (RR = 1.9 for BMI > or = 30 vs. BMI < 22, 95% confidence interval 1.4-2.5). Later childbearing and nulliparity were more strongly associated with in situ than invasive cancer in pre-menopausal women. Post-menopausal hormone use was more strongly associated with invasive disease. RR associated with family history and breast density were similar for in situ cancer and invasive cancer. Results indicating that BMI is related to post-menopausal invasive cancers but unrelated to in situ cancers are consistent with the hypothesis that concomitants of obesity activate proliferation."

The impact of communication may vary across ethnicity, depending on cultural emphases placed on interpersonal relationships. The current study's objectives were to (a) explore the role of family/friend and provider communication with regard to time to follow-up and distress and (b) examine if family/friend and provider communication moderates associations between ethnicity and these outcomes. A convenience-based sample of 41 Latina and 41 non-Latina White (NLW) women who had received an abnormal mammogram result was recruited from Washington State. Women who discussed results with providers had a shorter time to follow-up, although this was not significant when including health insurance. A significant interaction between conversations with family/friends and ethnicity was found: Latinas who did not have conversations with family/friends had particularly elevated psychological distress relative to NLW women and slightly more than other Latinas. This exploratory study suggests health communication with providers and family/friends is important for timely receipt of follow-up care and reduced distress among women who receive an abnormal mammogram result, which has implications for cancer education intervention development and adaptation.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the combined expression of alpha6beta4 integrin and neuroepithelioma transforming gene 1 (Net1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor specific for Ras homolog gene family member A, is associated with adverse clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. Immunohistochemical expression of each protein was evaluated in a tumor tissue microarray prepared from the primary tumors of 94 node-positive patients with invasive breast carcinoma treated with total mastectomy and doxorubicin-based chemotherapy without radiation with a median follow-up of 12.5 years. Associations between staining results and multiple clinicopathologic variables were investigated. Although there was no significant association between alpha6beta4 integrin or Net1 expression and clinical outcome when each marker was considered individually, coexpression of alpha6beta4 and Net1 was associated with decreased distant metastasis-free survival (P = 0.030). In the subset of patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors, coexpression of alpha6beta4 and Net1 was associated with a decrease in distant metastasis-free and overall survival (P < 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively). Although an association between human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression and coexpression of alpha6beta4 and Net1 (P = 0.008) was observed, coexpression of alpha6beta4 and Net1 (hazard ratio, 1.63; P = 0.02) and lymphovascular invasion (hazard ratio, 2.35; P = 0.02) were the only factors independently associated with the development of distant metastasis in multivariate analysis.

Previous studies suggest preeclampsia may be associated with a decreased risk of subsequent breast cancer and hyperemesis with an increased risk, but the evidence remains unclear. We used data from the Generations Study, a large prospective study of women in the United Kingdom, to estimate relative risks of breast cancer in relation to a history of preeclampsia and hyperemesis using Cox regression adjusting for known breast cancer risk factors. During 7.5 years average follow-up of 82,053 parous women, 1,969 were diagnosed with invasive or in situ breast cancer. Women who had experienced preeclampsia during pregnancy had a significantly decreased risk of premenopausal breast cancer (hazard ratio (HR) =0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49-0.90) and of HER2-enriched tumours (HR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.12-0.91), but there was no association with overall (HR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80-1.02) or postmenopausal (HR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.85-1.12) breast cancer risk.

Hyperemesis was associated with a significantly increased risk of HER2-enriched tumours (HR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.07-2.87), but not with other intrinsic subtypes or breast cancer risk overall. These results provide evidence that preeclampsia is associated with a decreased risk of premenopausal and HER2-enriched breast cancer and that hyperemesis, although not associated with breast cancer risk overall, may be associated with raised risk of HER2-enriched tumours."

Forty cases of locally recurrent breast carcinomas (median onset: 3.6 years after primary surgery) were analysed: 22 patients had undergone breast-conserving therapy and 18 mastectomy. Eighteen microsatellites on chromosomes 2p, 3p, 5q, 10q, 11p, 11q, 13q, 17q, 17p, 18p were amplified by PCR using fluorescent-labelled primers, automatically detected after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analysed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or microsatellite instability (MSI). Follow-up data were available for 39 cases with a median value of 89 months. All LOH and MSI found in the primary tumours were also present in the corresponding recurrences, indicating that they are genetically related to the primary tumours and not secondary malignancies in the same breast. MSI was found in three cases, of which one harboured MSI at more than two loci. The median value of LOH per case was significantly higher in the recurrent (four per case) compared to the primary tumours (two per case; p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test), reflecting the genotype of tumour progression. Early local recurrence was associated with specific LOH for TP53.15 (p = 0.018, log-rank test) in the primary tumours. LOH on D13S1699 or D17S855 was associated with lymph node metastases (p = 0.024 and p = 0.019, respectively; chi-square test). In addition, tumour grade, lack of oestrogen or progesterone receptor expression, young patient age and early appearance of local recurrence significantly correlated with poor survival. The development of local recurrence despite clear resection margins may result from residual DCIS distant from the invasive carcinoma, homing of circulating tumour cells, or genetically altered, histologically normal breast tissue not immediately adjacent to the invasive carcinoma."

Expression rates of Th17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells in breast cancer and normal (i.e. non-cancerous) tissue were evaluated using flow cytometry in 30 patients with breast carcinoma. Further, expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in breast cancer tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Associations between Th17 expression and other parameters were analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis. We observed that expression of Th17 cells was significantly higher in breast cancer compared to normal breast tissue. Further, expressions of IL-17, IL-1β, and IL-6 in cancer tissue positively correlated with expression of Th17 cells. In addition, there was a negative association between the numbers of Th17 cells and TNM stage, blood vessel invasion, and increased numbers of metastatic lymph nodes. Finally, expression of Th17 was not associated with expression of Treg.

Correspondingly, the authors of the current study hypothesized that the contemporary multidisciplinary management of breast carcinoma would lead to an improvement in IBTR rates after BCT.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Between 1970 and 1996, 1355 patients with pathologic Stage I-II invasive breast carcinoma underwent BCT (breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy) at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Contemporary methods of analyzing surgical margins were in routine use by 1994. To analyze the effect of this variable and others, patient and tumor characteristics and IBTR rates in patients treated during 1994-1996 were compared with those in patients treated from 1970 to 1993.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Characteristics were similar in patients treated during 1994-1996 (n = 381) and those treated before 1994 (n = 974) except for patients aged >50 years (63.3% vs. 51.7%, P < 0.001), and patients who had a family history of breast carcinoma (37.9% vs. 30.8%, P = 0.017). Patients treated after 1994 were less likely to have positive or unknown margins (2.9 % vs. 24.1 %, P = 0.0001), more likely to receive chemotherapy (40.5% vs. 26%, P < 0.001), and more likely to receive hormonal therapy (33.3% vs. 19.4%, P < 0.001), but less likely to receive radiation boosts to the primary tumor bed (59.8% vs. 89%, P < 0.001). The 5-year cumulative IBTR rate was significantly lower among patients treated in 1994-1996 than among patients treated before 1994 (1.3% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.001) largely because of the drop in IBTR rates among patients aged < or = 50 years (1.4 % vs. 9.1 %, P = 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, age > 50 (hazards ratio [HR] = 0.401; P = 0.0001), presence of negative surgical margins (HR = 0.574; P = 0.017), and use of adjuvant hormonal therapy (HR = 0.402; P = 0.05) were independent predictors of improved 5-year IBTR-free survival. On subgroup analysis, use of chemotherapy was associated with increased IBTR-free survival among women aged < or = 50 years (HR = 0.383; P = 0.001). Although 5-year cumulative IBTR rates were lower among women aged > 50 years than among younger women before 1994 (2.6 % vs. 9.1%, P < 0.0001), no such difference was found in the group treated in 1994-1996 (1.2 % for age > 50 yrs vs. 1.4 % for < or = 50 yrs, P = 0.999).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The IBTR rate after BCT appears to be declining, especially among patients < 50 years of age. However, long-term follow-up is necessary to confirm this finding. This finding may reflect changes in surgical approaches and pathologic evaluation as well as an increased use of systemic therapy. The current low incidence of IBTR with multidisciplinary management of breast carcinoma may result in more patients choosing BCT over mastectomy."

            "abstract": "The literature shows a wide range in the frequencies of finding breast carcinoma in the excised specimens following a biopsy diagnosis of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), likely due to a poor diagnostic reproducibility among different pathologists as well as an inherent heterogeneity in ADH. We evaluated whether histologic subtyping of ADH would help predict the risk of breast carcinoma. Our study consisted of 143 cases of ADH diagnosed by core needle biopsy and followed by excision. Of these, 54 cases (37.8%) showed carcinoma in the excised specimens (47 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ alone, 3 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma alone, and 4 cases of mixed invasive ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ). We arbitrarily divided ADH into two subtypes: type A was considered when one or more ducts were completely replaced by low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ type cells but the lesion was <2 mm and type B was considered when one or more ducts were partially involved by low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ type cells regardless of lesion size. Type A was associated with a significantly higher frequency of breast carcinoma (63.6%) than type B (30.0%). ADH containing punctate necrosis showed a higher association of carcinoma (66.7%) compared to those without necrosis (35.1%). Within type B ADH, involvement of 3 or more foci had a higher frequency of carcinoma (50.0%) than involvement of fewer foci (26.6%). These histologic features of ADH may prove useful in predicting the likelihood of breast carcinoma and provide helpful information for patient's management."

However, mastectomy is still performed in 30-50% of patients undergoing surgeries. There is increasing interest in preservation of the nipple and/or areola in hopes of achieving improved cosmetic and functional outcomes; however, the oncologic safety of nipple-areolar complex (NAC) preservation is a major concern.

Only 21 (28%) of 75 of cases with NAC involvement could be identified grossly by inspection of the surgical specimen (seven of these had been clinically identified). NAC involvement was most significantly associated with tumors located in all four quadrants (P<0.0001), tumors>5 cm in size (P=0.0014 for invasive carcinoma and P=0.0032 for in-situ carcinoma), grade 3 tumors (P=0.0192), tumors with higher nuclear grades (P=0.0184), and tumors with HER2 overexpression (P=0.0137).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      On the basis of our findings, we have developed a mathematical model that is based on the extent and location of the tumor, HER2 expression, and nuclear grade that predicts the probability of NAC involvement by breast cancer.

However, little is known about family resilience and psychological well-being among Chinese breast cancer survivors and their caregivers. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the direct and indirect relationships between family resilience, breast cancer survivors' post-traumatic growth (PTG), quality of life (QOL), and their principal caregivers' caregiver burden. A total of 108 breast cancer survivors/principal caregivers pairs completed a cross-sectional questionnaire survey in a comprehensive cancer of a public hospital in Shandong Province, China. The structural equation modelling (SEM) results showed that family resilience had direct and indirect effects on QOL and caregiver burden, and it was positively related to the PTG of the survivors. The survivors' PTG was positively related to their QOL, and their QOL was negatively associated with caregiver burden. Therefore, a better understanding of how family resilience contributes to PTG and QOL of the survivors and caregiver burden could help clinicians tailor interventions to enhance interventions aimed at improving both survivors' and caregivers' well-being."

Scores of 0-2, 3-5 and 6-8 were ranked as poor, fair and good, respectively. Among 146 participants these scores were achieved by 1%, 55% and 45% before activity and 0%, 16% and 84% after the activity. Overall 66% of participants increased their knowledge score.

In spite of its relevant biological significance, recent studies have produced conflicting results regarding the capacity of microvessel quantifications in breast carcinomas to predict patients' outcome and the existence of metastasis. In order to provide further information in this issue, we evaluated tumour angiogenesis in a series of 45 primary breast carcinomas (mean age: 55.3 +/- 14.2) and examined their association with established or potentially useful prognostic parameters. Microvessels were highlighted by immunohistochemical staining for factor VIII-related antigen and counted in the three most vascularized areas in a 200 x field (0.74 mm2) by four observers simultaneously. Results were analysed for the average vessel count of each case. The mean intratumoural microvessel count was 57.7 +/- 24.4 (range: 24.3 to 127.7). We found a statistically significant association between angiogenesis and age. The microvessels count in patients younger than 50 years was 67.8 +/- 26.4, from 51 to 70 years, 52.0 +/- 22.8 and over 71 years, 46.1 +/- 14.2 (p = 0.03). Node positive patients had slightly higher microvessel counts (60.3 +/- 25.3) than node negative ones (54.4 +/- 23.5); this difference was not significant (p = 0.42), even when we considered each age group per se. No association was found between angiogenesis and tumour size, histologic grade, estrogen receptor, MIB-1 index, ploidy and expression of p53 and c-erbB-2.

Both tumor types also express receptors that are associated with a proliferative response to progesterone, estrogen, and androgen hormones. Despite this clinical evidence, no genetic links between the two tumor types have been found. The breast carcinoma genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been linked to familial and sporadic forms of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, providing an opportunity to test this clinical observation. We conducted studies to detect alterations of the BRCA genes in meningiomas. Evaluation of 60 sporadic meningiomas with a panel of eight microsatellite and two restriction fragment length polymorphism markers at the locations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 demonstrated no loss of heterozygosity. Microsatellite instability was detected for one meningioma at two markers close to the BRCA2 locus. Northern blot analysis did not reveal any differences in mRNA expression of meningiomas compared to control tissues. These results suggest that alterations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are not common pathogenetic events in the development of sporadic meningiomas."

It is characterized by an aggressive clinical history, high rate of local relapse, and association with the basal epithelial-like subtype. Variations in breast cancer subtype and clinical outcome often exist across racial and ethnic lines. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the immunohistochemical and clinicopathologic characteristics of triple-negative breast carcinoma in women living in Vietnam with those from the United States. Invasive triple-negative breast carcinoma of patients from the 2 populations was characterized by tissue microarray for the expression of basal cytokeratins (CK5/6, CK7, CK14), luminal cytokeratins (CK8, CK18, CK19), and markers associated with the basal phenotype (cKit, epithelial growth factor receptor, P-cadherin, p53, and p63). Significant differences in expression between the 2 populations were not observed for the basal cytokeratins. However, epithelial growth factor receptor and P-cadherin, markers associated with the basal phenotype, were underexpressed in Vietnamese patients. Of the luminal cytokeratins, CK8 was overexpressed and CK18 was underexpressed in the Vietnamese women. Significant differences were also observed regarding the clinicopathologic characteristics. Triple-negative breast carcinoma in Vietnamese women was smaller and less likely to be grade III. In addition, it was more frequently of ductal histologic type and less often medullary or metaplastic. These differences in histology and marker expression suggest that triple-negative breast carcinoma has unique biological characteristics in women from Vietnam and the United States, and may follow a unique clinical course in each of the 2 populations."

Whereas studies in animals have shown prolactin to be an initiator and promoter of breast carcinoma, studies in humans have been inconclusive. Some studies have shown raised levels of prolactin in patients with breast carcinoma and their daughters, while others have not. The paucity of case reports linking breast carcinoma and prolactinoma may indicate that the association is mere coincidence, but studies evaluating the relationship between breast carcinoma and all forms of hyperprolactinemia need to be conducted before a causal link is dismissed.

There was an inverse statistically significant relationship between estrogen receptor (ER) positivity and p53 expression. Tumors with the p53(+)/HER(-) immunophenotype tended to be MEDs or duct carcinomas with a marked lymphoplasmacytic reaction. Infiltrating lobular carcinomas (IFLCs) were largely p53(-)/HER(-). p53(+)/HER(+) carcinomas had the best prognosis. The poorest outcome was associated with the p53(-)/HER(+) immunophenotype. This trend was statistically significant for recurrence-free and overall survival in patients with T1NOMO infiltrating duct carcinoma (IFDC).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The IH demonstration of p53 was not a reliable prognostic indicator in the node-negative breast carcinoma patients studied and it was not associated with major epidemiologic risk factors.

            "abstract": "It is well known that sex steroids are involved in the growth of breast cancers, and the great majority of breast carcinomas express estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and androgen (AR) receptors. In particular, recent studies have demonstrated that estrogens and androgens are locally produced in breast carcinoma tissues, and total blockade of in situ estrogen production potentially leads to an improvement in prognosis of breast cancer patients. Therefore, it is important to obtain a better understanding of sex steroid-producing enzymes in breast carcinoma tissues. In this review, we summarize recent studies on the expression and regulation of enzymes related to intratumoral production of estrogens (aromatase, 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17betaHSD1), and steroid sulfatase (STS) etc) and androgens (17betaHSD5 and 5alpha-reductase) in human breast carcinoma tissues, and discuss the biological and/or clinical significance of these enzymes. The cellular localization of aromatase in breast carcinoma tissues still remains controversial. Therefore, we examined localization of aromatase mRNA in breast carcinoma tissues by laser capture microdissection/real time-polymerase chain reaction. Aromatase mRNA expression was detected in both carcinoma and intratumoral stromal cells, and the expression level of aromatase mRNA was higher in intratumoral stromal cells than in carcinoma cells in the cases examined. We also examined an association among the immunoreactivity of enzymes related to intratumoral estrogen production and ERs in breast carcinoma tissues, but no significant association was detected. Therefore, the enzymes responsible for the intratumoral production of estrogen may not always be the same among breast cancer patients, and not only aromatase but also other enzymes such as STS and 17betaHSD1 may have important therapeutic potential as targets for endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients."

The evaluation of immunostaining for CD was performed separately in both the parenchymal and stromal cells. Microvessel density was correlated positively with histological grade and peritumoral lymphovascular invasion, and correlated inversely with ER status. Positive CD staining of tumour cells was more frequent in positive ER tumours and was not significantly associated with the other classical prognostic factors. However, moderate to strong staining of host cells was correlated with higher histological grade, higher mitotic index and lack of ER protein.

Pathological characteristics including immunohistochemical determinations of estrogen and progesterone receptors are shown, as well as interrelations of the different factors between themselves and with the follow up. Results showed significant relations between positive estrogen receptors and low nuclear grade (p < 0.001), histological low grade (p = 0.06) and positive progesterone receptors (p = 0.001). In addition, progesterone receptors were associated with stage I (p = 0.02); tumors with less than 2 cm in diameter (p = 0.01); low nuclear grade (p < 0.001) and positive estrogen receptors (p < 0.001). The univariate Cox regression analysis of prognostic factors revealed an association between positive lymph nodes and high nuclear grade with a more frequent tumoral recurrence. On the other hand, overall survival was significantly affected by cases in stage II, positive lymph nodes, tumors with diameter greater than 2 cm, and high nuclear grade. Stepwise Cox regression analysis showed that a high nuclear grade, positive lymph nodes and absence of estrogen receptor, were associated with a higher risk for recurrence and that tumor size and the state of lymph nodes were predictive for overall survival. This paper demonstrates that histochemical determination of hormonal receptors is useful because together with other known prognostic factors it contributes to a better management of patients with breast carcinoma."

We investigated the role of APLF in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) linked to breast cancer invasiveness and metastasis. Here, we show that a significant manifestation of APLF is present in tumor sections of patients with invasive ductal carcinoma when compared to their normal adjacent tissues. APLF was significantly induced in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, MDAMB-231, in comparison to invasive MCF7 or normal MCF10A breast cells and supported by studies on invasive breast carcinoma in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Functionally, APLF downregulation inhibited proliferative capacity, altered cell cycle behavior, induced apoptosis and impaired DNA repair ability of MDAMB-231 cells. Reduction in APLF level impeded invasive, migratory, tumorigenic and metastatic potential of TNBC cells with loss in expression of genes associated with EMT while upregulation of MET-specific gene E-cadherin (CDH1). So, here we provided novel evidence for enrichment of APLF in breast tumors, which could regulate metastasis-associated EMT in invasive breast cancer.

Although there have been tremendous advances in elucidating genetic risk factors underlying both familial and sporadic breast cancer, much of the genetic contribution to breast cancer etiology remains unknown. The discovery of BRCA1 and BRCA2 over 20 years ago remains the seminal event in the field and has paved the way for the discovery of other high-penetrance susceptibility genes by linkage analysis. The advent of genome-wide association studies made possible the next wave of discoveries, in which over 80 low-penetrance and moderate-penetrance variants were identified. Although these studies were highly successful at discovering variants associated with both familial and sporadic breast cancer, the variants identified to date explain only 50 % of the heritability of breast cancer. In this review, we look back at the investigative strategies that have led to our current understanding of breast cancer genetics, consider the challenges of performing association studies in heterogeneous complex diseases such as breast cancer, and look ahead toward the types of study designs that may lead to the identification of the genetic variation accounting for the remaining missing heritability."

            "abstract": "We studied a series of 44 consecutive cases of male breast carcinoma over a 14 year period in order to evaluate the clinico-pathological characteristics and the impact of some morphologic factors on prognosis. The age of the patients ranged from 38 to 84 years (mean 62 +/- 10.8). All the patients presented a painless mass, associated with nipple retraction in 13 cases (29.4%), skin ulceration in 12 cases (27.2%) and nipple discharge in 6 (13.6%). Microscopically all the tumors were infiltrating ductal carcinomas, 42 being of the NOS type. A better survival was associated with low mitotic index, T 1 tumors and absence of peritumoral lymphatic permeation. However, only these two parameters had statistical significance and were found to have predictive value on the prognosis of the disease. The degree of differentiation assessed according to Bloom and Richardson's classification showed no influence on prognosis. Post surgical radiotherapy did not seem to influence the outcome of the disease."

The aim was to qualitatively identify how Latina women cope with BC treatment, what emotions arose during their treatment, and if they experienced any medical barriers during their journey. Women were also asked about a potential online resource. Specific emotions of anger and fear were commonly identified but related to different contexts. Family support and spirituality were frequently cited as two positive coping resources during BC and its treatment. Additionally, women expressed what they believe would be essential in an online community that would provide aid with BC support. Given the importance of reaching this vulnerable minority group, we recommend that future studies contextualize Latina women's emotional experiences and coping skills associated with BC as indicators of well-being. Along with previous studies, this study highlights the importance of developing culturally appropriate interventions. Additionally, we address alternative forms of resources that may be more accessible."

The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of lobulitis in benign breast tissue of patients with breast cancer and associated clinicopathologic features. We reviewed nonneoplastic breast tissue sections from 334 patients with invasive breast carcinoma to study lobulitis in normal breast tissue and to correlate its presence with clinicopathologic features of the associated tumor. Clinical information (age, menopausal status, and follow-up), tumor characteristics (type, grade, size, lymph node status, stage, estrogen and progesterone receptor, HER2), and survival were recorded. Characteristics of women with and without lobulitis were cross-classified with categories of clinical, pathologic, and histologic characteristics, and differences in distributions were tested in univariate and multivariate analysis. Lobulitis was found in 26 (8%) of 334 patients. The lymphocytic infiltrate was predominantly T-cell type. In a multivariate model, lobulitis in patients with breast cancer was significantly associated with younger age, triple (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2)-negative cancers, and medullary phenotypes. Lobulitis in nonneoplastic breast tissue, away from tumor, is associated with clinicopathologic features more commonly seen in hereditary breast cancer."

Recent data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries showed that DCIS-associated radiotherapy treatment significantly increased risk of second non-breast cancers including lung cancer. To help understand those observations and whether breast cancer risk factors are related to radiotherapy treatment decision-making, we examined associations between lifestyle and clinical factors with DCIS radiotherapy receipt.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Among 1628 participants from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, diagnosed with incident DCIS (1995-2011), we examined associations between lifestyle and clinical factors with radiotherapy receipt.

However positive associations were observed for moderate alcohol consumption and infrequent physical activity. The strongest associations were observed for radiotherapy receipt and more recent diagnoses (2005-2011 vs. 1995-1999; OR 1.60, 95%CI 1.14, 2.25), poorly versus well-differentiated tumors (OR 1.69, 95%CI 1.16, 2.46) and endocrine therapy (OR 3.37, 95%CI 2.56, 4.44).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Clinical characteristics were the strongest determinants of DCIS radiotherapy.

Ovarian cancer, despite having a lower incidence, represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality because it is usually discovered in advanced stages. The presence of both forms of cancer in a patient is associated with a high risk of BRCA1 gene mutations, which are responsible, together with BRCA2 gene mutations, for most of the breast and ovarian cancer family. Our case is special because it presents a synchronous and a rare association of a primary ovarian dysgerminoma (with an incidence of less than 1% of ovarian cancers) and a primary breast carcinoma in a patient of 46 years old. Immunohistochemical examination was performed using a panel of five biomarkers: oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, Herceptest, p53 and BRCA1. In our case, we identified a negative hormonal status and the absence of HER2/neu expression but a positive immuno-expression for p53 protein and BRCA1 protein. Postoperative course was favourable for the patient after each surgery, and she was discharged with the recommendation to perform a genetic counselling."

The p130Cas scaffold protein is overexpressed in human ER+ and HER2+ breast cancer where it contributes to cancer progression, invasion and resistance to therapy. However, its role in regulating mesenchymal aggressive breast cancer cells remains to be determined. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular and functional involvement of this adaptor protein in breast cancer cell plasticity.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We used silencing strategies and rescue experiments to evaluate phenotypic and biochemical changes from mesenchymal to epithelial traits in breast tumor cell lines. In the mouse A17 cell model previously related to mesenchymal cancer stem cells and basal-like breast cancer, we biochemically dissected the signaling pathways involved and performed functional in vivo tumor growth ability assays. The significance of the signaling platform was assessed in a human setting through the use of specific inhibitors in aggressive MDA-MB-231 subpopulation LM2-4175 cells. To evaluate the clinical relevance of the results, we analyzed publicly available microarray data from the Netherlands Cancer Institute and from the Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We show that p130Cas silencing induces loss of mesenchymal features, by downregulating Vimentin, Snail, Slug and Twist transcriptional factors, resulting in the acquirement of epithelial-like traits. Mechanistically, p130Cas controls Cyclooxygenase-2 transcriptional expression, which in turn contributes to p130Cas-dependent maintenance of mesenchymal phenotype. This cascade of events also compromises in vivo tumor growth through inhibition of cell signaling controlling cell cycle progression. c-Src and JNK kinases are sequential players in p130Cas/ Cyclooxygenase-2 axis and their pharmacological inhibition is sufficient to downregulate Cyclooxygenase-2 leading to an epithelial phenotype. Finally, in silico microarray data analysis indicates that p130Cas and Cyclooxygenase-2 concomitant overexpression predicts poor survival and high probability of breast tumor recurrence.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Overall, these data identify a new p130Cas/Cyclooxygenase-2 axis as a crucial element in the control of breast tumor plasticity, opening new therapeutic strategies leading to inhibition of these pathways in aggressive breast carcinoma."

We examined baseline and slopes over time for change in depression and trauma symptoms, and emotional well-being. We were particularly concerned that being matched with a newly diagnosed breast cancer patient might trigger a re-experiencing of trauma symptoms for the navigator, so we examined a re-experiencing subscale. All participants completed baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-month assessments. Our hypotheses were tested in separate Analyses of Variance (married versus not) for the 39 sojourners and 34 navigators who provided baseline assessments, and the 29 sojourners and 24 navigators who were matched and provided at least one follow-up. We found no significant baseline associations for navigators or sojourners. Being single/not married was associated with increasing depression symptoms over time in both navigators and sojourners compared with being married/partnered. By 12 months, these increases crossed above the clinical cut-off for significant depression symptoms. Single status did not predict increasing trauma symptoms over time. However, being single/not married predicted a significant increase in navigators' re-experiencing of trauma symptoms. Over time, married sojourners increased significantly in emotional well-being, whereas single/not married navigators did not differ from married navigators.

A statistically significant association between a nucleolar shape polymorphism and the number of nucleoli in the nuclei of tumour cells and the RFS but not OS was found in the entire group of patients as well as patients with axillary lymph node metastases. A higher polymorphism of nucleolar shape and a higher number of nucleoli in the nuclei of breast cancer cells were associated with decreased relapse-free survival (p < 0.05). The remaining morphometric parameters showed no statistically significant association with RFS or OS. The results indicate that morphometry of nucleoli in MG-PY stained histological sections can be useful in the analysis of associations between nucleolar parameters and prognosis of patients with invasive breast cancer."

This study examines the relationship between social support and survival among women diagnosed with breast carcinoma, specifically assessing the effect of network size and changes in social contact post-diagnosis.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A population-based sample of 584 women was followed for up to 12.5 years (median follow-up = 10.3 years). The mean age at diagnosis was 44 years, 81% were married, and 29% were racial/ethnic minorities. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate survival as a function of social support (changes in social contact and the size of social support), disease severity, treatment, health status, and socio-demographic factors.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Fifty-four percent of the women had local and 44% had regional stage disease. About 53% underwent mastectomy, 68% received chemotherapy, and 55% had radiation. Regression results showed that disease stage, estrogen receptor status, and mastectomy were associated with greater risk of dying. Although network size was not related to survival, increased contact with friends/family post-diagnosis was associated with lower risk of death, with a hazard ratio of 0.31 (95% CI, 0.17-0.57).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Findings from this study have identified an important aspect of a woman's social network that impacts survival. An increase in the amount of social contact, representing greater social support, may increase the likelihood of the women's survival by enhancing their coping skills, providing emotional support, and expanding opportunities for information-sharing."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify patient-, tumour- or treatment-related factors associated with young age that might explain the higher risk of ipsilateral breast recurrence that occurs after breast-conserving therapy (BCT) in young breast cancer patients. In the 'boost versus no boost trial', 5569 early-stage breast cancer patients were entered. All patients underwent tumorectomy followed by whole breast irradiation of 50 Gy. Patients having a microscopically complete excision were randomised between receiving no boost or a 16-Gy boost, while patients with a microscopically incomplete excision were randomised between receiving a boost dose of 10 or 26 Gy. The 5-year local control rate was 82% for patients <or=35 years, 85% for patients aged 36-40 years, 92% for patients 41-50 years, 96% for patients 51-60 years and 97% for patients >60 years of age (P<0.0001). In young patients, the tumour was significantly larger and more often oestrogen and progesterone receptor-negative. Invasive carcinoma and the intraductal component were more often of a high grade. The intraductal component was more frequently incompletely resected in young patients. Re-excisions were performed more often (most probably due to a more frequent incomplete excision at the first attempt). The total volume of breast tissue removed at the tumorectomy was smaller in the younger patient group, even after including the volume removed during re-excision. When relating all these parameters (including age itself) to local control, the multivariate analysis stratified by treatment showed that age was the only independent prognostic factor for local control (P=0.0001). Including the boost treatment as a separate covariate, the analysis retained age and boost treatment as significant factors related to local control (P<0.0001). It was shown that the boost dose significantly reduced the 5-year local recurrence rate from 7 to 4% for patients with a complete excision (P<0.001). For patients 40 years of age or younger, the boost dose reduced the local recurrence rate from 20 to 10% (P=0.002). This large European Orgnaization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial demonstrated an increased local recurrence rate in young patients. Although several associations between patient, tumour and treatment factors and age were found, that might explain the high local recurrence rate in the younger patients, it appears that age itself and the boost dose were the only factors that were independently related to local control."

Two different phenotypes were distinguished by an index calculated on the basis of the variables (histologic grade, necrosis, lymphoid infiltration, number of mitosis and expression of c-erbB-2, p53, progesterone receptor and Bcl-2). Phenotype A lesions share most of the features of normal breast tissue. Phenotype B looks more malignant, has a higher early recurrence rate and is more frequently seen in younger patients. Our aim was to see if ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS) could be divided into the same phenotypes. One hundred and eighty DCIS were investigated. Association between the eight variables was studied in 2 x 2 models. The phenotype index was calculated by summing weights for the variables in the MCA. All variables were associated, except Bcl-2. DCIS was divided in two phenotypes. Thirty-three tumours were Phenotype A and 147 Phenotype B. The mean age at diagnosis was 65.5 and 58.4 years for Phenotypes A and B, respectively (p = 0.0012). No difference regarding local relapse free survival was seen. Two phenotypes were distinguished in DCIS, similar to invasive breast cancer. In an earlier study, 45% of the invasive cancers were classified as Phenotype B. In this study, 82% of DCIS were Phenotype B. This may indicate that invasive breast cancer of Phenotype B is derived from DCIS of Phenotype B. The distribution of DCIS phenotypes with a small proportion of Phenotype A DCIS may be due to that Phenotype A DCIS is less likely to be detected by mammography, or that some invasive breast cancers of Phenotype A progress to invasiveness without passing the in situ phase."

The positive gold particle labelling was amplified with silver enhancement solution, and the specimens were then routinely critical point dried, sputter-coated with palladium and observed under SEM. The studies show that T and Tn EPs are not randomly distributed on CA cell surface; they are aggregated at the adhesion plaque area.

Node involvement increased with body weight and Quetelet index. This association was more regular and much stronger among patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors than among those with estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers. Among patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, the percentage with involved nodes at diagnosis increased regularly from 32.9% among lean patients (Quetelet index less than 21 kg/m2) to 65.6% among obese women (Quetelet index greater than 27 kg/m2). This trend was seen even after adjustment for age and tumor size. In contrast, among patients with estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers, the association of weight and Quetelet index with node involvement were weak and irregular. The modifying effect of estrogen receptor status on the relation of obesity to node involvement was apparent in pre- and post-menopausal women. Body weight and Quetelet index were not related to estrogen receptor status or to any of the measured histologic features of breast tumors including nuclear grade, histologic grade, tubule formation, mitotic activity, and size of nucleus of cancer cells. These findings suggest that the observed deleterious effect of obesity on breast cancer prognosis is unlikely to be an artifact of delayed diagnosis in overweight patients. It may be due to hormonal changes associated with increases in body weight."

Forty-three women who had lost a close relative to breast cancer wrote about the death (cognitive processing/disclosure group) or about nonemotional topics weekly for 4 weeks. Contrary to predictions, written disclosure did not induce changes in meaning-related goals or NK cell parameters. However, women in both experimental groups who reported positive changes in meaning-related goals over the study period also showed increases in NKCC.

Survival curves determined by the Kaplan-Meier method and univariate analysis demonstrated that reduced expression of Fhit was associated with a poor outcome (P = 0.0086, by log-rank test). Multivariate analysis using the stepwise Cox proportional hazard model showed that lymph node metastasis was related to poor survival rates; in addition, patients with loss of Fhit expression still tended to have poor survival (P = 0.0563).

We also investigated which variables had an impact on survival. The comedo group showed a significantly higher MIB1 labeling index than the non-comedo group (P < 0.0001). The differences in disease-free and overall survival between the two groups were not significant (P = 0.2477, P = 0.2069). Multivariate analysis of the entire series showed the MIB1 labeling index to be an independent prognostic factor predicting both disease-free survival and overall survival (P = 0.0160, P = 0.0035). When multivariate analysis was repeated separately for the non-comedo and comedo groups, the MIB1 labeling index remained the most important variable predicting disease-free and overall survival in the non-comedo group (P = 0.0122, P = 0.0040). Moreover, non-comedo patients with a high MIB1 labeling index had significantly shorter disease-free and overall survival than those with a low MIB1 labeling index (P = 0.0040, P = 0.0402). These findings imply that MIB1-determined proliferative activity of intraductal components is an independent predictor of survival, and is the most important predictor in non-comedo cases."

            "abstract": "Five breast cancer subtypes have been described in sporadic breast cancer (SBC) using expression arrays: basal-like, ERBB2, normal breast-like, luminal A and B. These molecular subtypes show different genomic aberration patterns (GAPs). Recently, our group described these breast cancer subtypes in 50 non-BRCA1/2 familial tumors using immunohistochemistry assays. We extended this study to the other classes of familial breast cancer (FBC), including 62 tumors (18 BRCA1, 16 BRCA2 and 28 non-BRCA1/2), with the same panel of 25 immunohistochemical (IHC) markers and histological grade obtaining a similar classification. We combined these data with results generated by a 1 Mb BAC array-based CGH study to evaluate the genomic aberrations of each group. We found that BRCA1-related tumors are preferentially basal-like, whereas non-BRCA1/2 familial tumors are mainly luminal A subtype. We described distinct GAPs related to each IHC subtype. Basal tumors had a greater number of gains/losses, while luminal B tumors had more high-level DNA amplifications. Our data are similar to those obtained in SBC studies, highlighting the existence of distinct genetic pathways of tumor evolution, common to both SBC and FBC."

            "abstract": "The hormonal carcinogenesis of breast cancer involves hormone-driven cell proliferation and genetic alterations, including oncogene activation and suppressor gene inactivation. However, the predominant genes involved in these processes are currently unknown. Our previous studies identified a gene, namely alpha-tocopherol-associated protein, which is preferentially expressed in normal/benign breast and prostate tissue, but its expression is downregulated in breast and prostate carcinomas. To further examine its function in hormone-induced carcinogenesis, we examined if there is an association between alpha-tocopherol-associated protein and estrogen-receptor expression in normal/benign breast tissue and in human breast carcinomas. We found that alpha-tocopherol-associated protein is coexpressed with estrogen receptor in the luminal cells of normal/benign breast tissue in a scattered manner by immunohistochemical staining of consecutive tissue sections of 20 cases, whereas alpha-tocopherol-associated protein expression is downregulated in 46% (45 of 98) of estrogen-receptor/progesterone-receptor-positive, so-called luminal type A or B human breast carcinoma. This is similar to the association of alpha-tocopherol-associated protein and androgen receptor expression in normal/benign prostate and prostate carcinomas. In contrast,alpha-tocopherol-associated protein expression is mostly negative in basal, Her2 and triple-negative nonbasal subtypes of high-grade breast carcinomas. These findings are consistent with alpha-tocopherol-associated protein acting as an antiproliferative factor in estrogen-receptor-positive luminal cells in normal/benign breast tissue. alpha-Tocopherol-associated protein downregulation may have triggered hormonal carcinogenesis in at least some of the breast carcinomas, providing further, albeit indirect evidence to support a role for vitamin E in breast cancer prevention."

We assessed total mortality associated with marital status, with attention to differences by race/ethnicity, tumor subtype, and neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES). We included, from the population-based California Cancer Registry, women ages 18 and older with invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 2005 and 2012 with follow-up through December 2013. We estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for total mortality by nSES, race/ethnicity, and tumor subtype. Among 145,564 breast cancer cases, 42.7% were unmarried at the time of diagnosis. In multivariable-adjusted models, the MRR (95% CI) for unmarried compared to married women was 1.28 (1.24-1.32) for total mortality. Significant interactions were observed by race/ethnicity (P<0.001), tumor subtype (P<0.001), and nSES (P = 0.009). Higher MRRs were observed for non-Hispanic whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders than for blacks or Hispanics, and for HR+/HER2+ tumors than other subtypes. Assessment of interactive effect between marital status and nSES showed that unmarried women living in low SES neighborhoods had a higher risk of dying compared with married women in high SES neighborhoods (MRR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.53-1.67). Unmarried breast cancer patients have higher total mortality than married patients; the association varies by race/ethnicity, tumor subtype, and nSES. Unmarried status should be further evaluated as a breast cancer prognostic factor. Identification of underlying causes of the marital status associations is needed to design interventions that could improve survival for unmarried breast cancer patients."

We studied paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from 382 cases including nonmalignant breast tissue, endometrium, lung, pancreas, and thyroid gland; breast carcinoma; and adenocarcinomas of the colon, endometrium, lung, ovary, pancreas, and thyroid gland. Membranous staining was present in all nonmalignant breast tissue specimens and in most breast carcinoma tissue specimens. Diffuse cytoplasmic staining was more extensive in breast carcinomas than in benign processes. However, similar staining was also seen in normal and neoplastic tissue specimens obtained from a variety of other sites. Sensitivity and specificity of diffuse cytoplasmic staining for CA-549 in breast carcinoma relative to carcinomas from other sites studied were 78.6% and 77.4%, respectively. Staining patterns were not preserved from primary tumor to metastases in 67.4% of cases evaluated.

Ethnocultural groups represented in the studies included Asian American, Aboriginal, Hispanic, and African American women. The synthesis revealed diverse experiences within and among these ethnocultural groups represented in 5 major themes: (a) the \"othered\" experience of a breast cancer diagnosis, (b) the treatment experience as \"other,\" (c) losses associated with breast cancer, (d) the family context of breast cancer experiences, and (e) coping with cancer through spirituality and community involvement. The integration of findings from the 15 studies also revealed how methodological and theoretical approaches to conducting this research influenced understandings of the experiences of breast cancer.

            "abstract": "There are 4 major molecular classifications in the literature that divide breast carcinoma into basal and nonbasal subtypes, with basal subtypes associated with poor prognosis. Basal subtype is defined as positive for cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, CK14, and/or CK17 in CK classification; negative for ER, PR, and HER2 in triple negative (TN) classification; negative for ER and negative or positive for HER2 in ER/HER2 classification; and positive for CK5/6, CK14, CK17, and/or EGFR; and negative for ER, PR, and HER2 in CK/TN classification. These classifications use similar terminology but different definitions; it is critical to understand the precise relationship between them. We compared these 4 classifications in 195 breast carcinomas and found that (1) the rates of basal subtypes varied from 5% to 36% for ductal carcinoma in situ and 14% to 40% for invasive ductal carcinoma. (2) The rates of basal subtypes varied from 19% to 76% for HG carcinoma and 1% to 7% for NHG carcinoma. (3) The rates of basal subtypes were strongly associated with tumor grades (P < .001) in all classifications and associated with tumor types (in situ versus invasive ductal carcinomas) in TN (P < .001) and CK/TN classifications (P = .035). (4) These classifications were related but not interchangeable (kappa ranges from 0.140 to 0.658 for HG carcinoma and from 0.098 to 0.654 for NHG carcinoma). In conclusion, although these classifications all divide breast carcinoma into basal and nonbasal subtypes, they are not interchangeable.

We investigated oral contraceptive use in relation to risk of BCIS in a large population-based case-control study. Female residents of Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire aged 20 to 74 years with a new diagnosis of BCIS (n=1,878) were identified from statewide tumor registries in 1997 to 2001. Age-matched female controls (n=8,041) were randomly selected from population lists. Information on oral contraceptive use and other risk factors was collected during structured telephone interviews. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using logistic regression. In multivariate models, ever use of oral contraceptives was associated with a small and marginally significant increase in BCIS overall (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.99-1.25) and for ductal carcinoma in situ (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.31). No strong associations were detected according to age started, duration, time since first or last use, or oral contraceptive use relative to the first full-term pregnancy. The slightly increased risk of BCIS seemed limited to former users (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.00-1.27) and women without a family history of breast cancer (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01-1.32 for ever versus never use).

The goal of this work was to evaluate potential associations between polymorphisms in CASP8 and CASP9, previously linked to breast cancer risk, and the transcript levels of these genes (including their alternative anti-apoptotic variants) in tumor tissues and the clinical characteristics of the patients.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      Sanger sequencing, high resolution melting (HRM) analysis, and allelic discrimination were used to identify polymorphisms in DNA samples isolated from tumor tissues and peripheral blood lymphocytes of 60 breast carcinoma patients. Total transcript levels of CASP8 and CASP9, and levels of alternative splicing variants CASP8L and CASP9B, were quantified by real-time PCR in tumor tissues. Clinically interesting associations were validated in DNA from lymphocytes of 615 breast carcinoma patients.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A haplotype in CASP9 composed of three polymorphisms rs4645978-rs2020903-rs4646034 was significantly associated with CASP9 expression in tumors, with the expression of the progesterone receptor and ERBB2, and with the TNBC subtype of breast carcinoma in the validation study. The associations between the rs3834129 polymorphism in CASP8 and stage of disease, rs6435074 with grade, expression of estrogen receptor and ERBB2, and rs6723097 with ERBB2 expression have not yet been validated.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein that is overexpressed in most human cancers, including breast, but is not expressed in normal tissue. Survivin is associated with more aggressive behavior and decreased survival in a variety of tumor types. It regulates the G2/M phase of the cell cycle by associating with mitotic spindle microtubules, and it directly inhibits caspase-3 and caspase-7 activity. We used a breast cancer tissue microarray to assess survivin and caspase-3 expression in breast cancer and to correlate both markers with proliferation (MIB-1), angiogenesis (CD31), and prognosis.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      A breast cancer tissue microarray with a total of 190 1-mm tissue samples (2 from each specimen) were immunostained for survivin, caspase-3, MIB-1, and CD31. The microarray contains 91 cases of breast carcinoma diagnosed at Emory University Hospital between 1992 and 2000, and 4 normal breast tissue controls. Follow-up information was obtained from hospital records and the Winship Cancer Center database.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eighty-four percent of breast carcinoma showed nuclear survivin expression. Normal breast tissue was immunonegative. Fifty-seven percent and 43% of breast cancer showed reduced and absent caspase-3 expression, respectively. Survivin (nuclear) and caspase (nuclear/cytoplasmic) expression showed significant correlation with histologic grade (P=0.008 and 0.041) and MIB-1 expression (P=0.033 and 0.012). Survivin nuclear expression also correlated significantly with tumor stage (P=0.012) and tended to correlate with estrogen receptor (P=0.050). There was no significant correlation between survivin and caspase expression. Furthermore, there was no correlation of both markers with other clinicopathologic parameters (age, tumor size, histologic type, progesterone receptor, Her-2 neu status, lymph node status), angiogenesis (CD31), or outcome (overall and disease-free survival).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Survivin and caspase-3 expression correlate with poor prognostic parameters (higher histologic grade and high proliferation), but not with outcome, in breast carcinoma patients."

The identification of novel molecular signatures is needed for earlier detection, monitoring effects of treatment, and predicting prognosis. We have previously used microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed genes in aggressive breast tumors. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of the candidate biomarkers CCNB2, ASPM, CDCA7, KIAA0101, and SLC27A2 in breast cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The expression levels and subcellular localization of the CCNB2, ASPM, CDCA7, KIAA0101, and SLC27A2 proteins were measured using immunohistochemistry (IHC) on a panel of 80 primary invasive breast tumors. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of CCNB2, KIAA0101, and SLC27A2 were subsequently examined by qRT-PCR to validate IHC results. Patient disease-specific survival (DSS) was evaluated in correlation to protein levels using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine the impact of aberrant protein expression of the candidate biomarkers on patient DSS and to estimate the hazard ratio at 8-year follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Elevated cytoplasmic CCNB2 protein levels were strongly associated with short-term disease-specific survival of breast cancer patients (≤ 8 years; P<0.001) and with histological tumor type (P= 0.04). However, no association with other clinicopathological parameters was observed. Multivariate Cox regression analysis specified that CCNB2 protein expression is an independent prognostic marker of DSS in breast cancer. The predictive ability of several classical clinicopathological parameters was improved when used in conjunction with CCNB2 protein expression (C-index = 0.795) in comparison with a model without CCNB2 expression (C-index = 0.698). The protein levels of ASPM, CDCA7, KIAA0101, and SLC27A2 did not correlate with any clinicopathological parameter and had no influence on DSS.

            "abstract": "Population-based studies have shown a concordance of breast cancer survival among first-degree relatives (FDRs), suggesting a heritable component. Reasons for such heritability remain to be elucidated. We aimed to determine whether association of breast cancer survival among FDRs is linked to shared patient and tumor characteristics or type of treatment. At the population-based Geneva Breast Cancer Registry, we identified 162 FDR pairs diagnosed with breast cancer. We categorized FDRs into poor, medium and good familial survival risk groups according to breast cancer-specific survival of their proband (mother or sister). We compared patient, tumor and treatment characteristics between categories and calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and adjusted disease-specific mortality for each group. Breast cancer patients in the poor familial survival risk group were more likely to be diagnosed at later stages than those in the good familial survival risk group. Similarly, they had higher SMRs than those in the medium and good survival risk groups (18.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.4-33.5 vs. 16.5, 95% CI: 7.5-31.3 and 9.4, 95% CI: 3.4-20.4, respectively). After adjustment for patient and tumor characteristics and type of treatment, women in the poor familial survival risk group were almost five times more likely to die of breast cancer than those in the good familial survival risk group (adjusted hazard ratio 4.8, 95% CI: 1.4-16.4).

However, the biological significance of LST-2 in human carcinomas remains unknown. In the present study, we examined the expression of LST-2 in 102 cases of breast carcinoma using immunohistochemistry and correlated the findings with various clinicopathological parameters in order to examine the possible biological and clinical significance of LST-2. LST-2 immunoreactivity was detected in 51 cases (50.0%); of these 51 positive cases, LST-2 immunoreactivity was inversely correlated with tumor size (P = 0.0289).

Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess associations between incident breast carcinoma and the use of specific antihypertensive medication including calcium channel blockers.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, an elevated risk of breast carcinoma was associated with use of calcium channel blockers (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-4.49). This association persisted when the comparison group was users of other antihypertensive medication. No associations between the use of other antihypertensive medication with incident breast carcinoma were found. Associations were enhanced by assessment of high dose at baseline (HR: 4.42; 95% CI, 1.37-14.27) and when calcium channel blockers were combined with estrogen use (HR: 4.48; 95% CI, 1.58-12.75). The association was found to be strongest for the use of estrogens with immediate release calcium channel blockers (HR: 8.48; 95% CI, 2.99-24.08).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although the number of cases was limited in this observational study, associations found between the use of calcium channel blockers and incident invasive breast carcinoma warrant further investigation. Site specific carcinomas should be included as an outcome of ongoing and planned long term clinical trials using calcium channel blockers."

            "abstract": "An unusual edematous and indurated erythema developed in four patients with breast carcinoma 1 to 6 months after conservative surgical treatment and irradiation. The radiation therapy consisted of megavoltage x-ray photon with or without either electron beam or iridium-192 interstitial boost. Several tissue biopsy specimens revealed pronounced lymphocytic dermal and fat inflammation in conjunction with focal areas of plasma cells. The connective tissue bundles were enlarged and hyalinized. Macrophages and isolated giant cells were noted in the dermis. One biopsy specimen showed elastic tissue in giant cell cytoplasm. No mucin, fibrin, formation of cysts, or calcification was present. Lipophages and hyaline connective tissue replaced some fat lobules. The radiation-induced changes of dilated and hyalinized blood vessels, endothelial cell hyperplasia, fibrosis associated with involution of epidermal appendages, and fibroblasts were present. This combination of radiation-related and inflammatory pathologic changes is unusual and emphasizes the remarkable qualities of this rare reaction. The clinical differential diagnoses of recurrent carcinoma, cellulitis, and connective tissue disease can be excluded by reviewing the pathologic characteristics."

The mean MVD in the hot spots ranged from 9 to 106 (median 31) vessels per x200 optical field. Patients were grouped into 3 categories of low (27 pts), medium (26 pts), and high (24 pts) MVD. Angiogenesis was not related to the primary tumor dimensions (T-stage) or the histology differentiation. An inverse association of MVD with estrogen receptor (ER) expression was noted (p=0.0007), while high MVD was directly related to c-erbB-2 overexpression (p=0.04) and high MIB1 proliferation index (p=0.02).

Lymph node status was the major predictor for both short and long term prognosis but had no important role in the survival of patients who relapsed. Antecedent abortions were related to less relapses. Age, previous benign breast diseases, nulliparity and lactation conditioned better prognosis without association with relapse probability, indicating an association with the speed of evolution of the disseminated disease.

For African-American women, this risk was not significantly associated with stage, nuclear grade, their interaction term, or other pathologic prognostic indicators.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The findings suggest that race modifies the association between the pathologic prognostic indicators of breast carcinoma and the likelihood of HER-2/neu-positive carcinoma. So far, clinical correlative studies of HER-2/neu have not included race as an independent variable.

At the time of death the patients' age ranged from 52 to 95 years (average 70.6 years). Breast carcinomas were documented ante mortem in 11 cases and at autopsy in 1. Meningiomas were diagnosed at autopsy (10 cases) or in vivo (2 cases). The diagnosis of meningioma antedated that of mammary carcinoma in only one patient. Histologically, the cancers were of ductal (11 cases) and lobular infiltrating (1 case) types and showed a variable malignancy grade. Widespread extracranial metastases were present at autopsy in 7 cases. Brain metastases were seen in 1 case. Neurologic signs were referred in 4 subjects. Four breast cancers and one meningioma showed immunoreactivity for progesterone receptors, whereas all the cases were negative for estrogen receptors. In one case, metastatic breast carcinoma tissue was present within a psammomatous meningioma. A brief review of the literature, which includes 14 similar observations, is reported. Although the association of breast cancer and meningioma is still difficult to explain, its clinical implications are important and deserve proper attention. A proper work up in patients with suspected intracranial metastases is recommended so that resectable meningiomas are not mistaken for metastases."

As a result, surgical excision has become the standard of care for patients with ADH. In contrast, because data on the relation between breast malignancy and lobular neoplasia (LN) detected on core biopsy are limited, clinical management of patients with LN remains controversial.

Assessing the clinicopathological significance of Runx2 expression in a cohort of breast invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC). The correlation of nuclear Runx2 LI with clinicopathological parameters was assessed in 84 IDCs. To study the association of Runx2 with patient outcomes, in addition to treating it as a continuous variable, Runx2 was categorized by its median value (65) and by an additional two cut-off points determined by ROC curve analyses, at 45 for disease free survival (DFS) and 40 for overall survival (OS). Multivariate Cox regression models were also constructed. We used the best subset regression to identify models that predict DFS and OS with as few predictors as possible, and validation was performed. Based on the \"Predicted R(2)\", the three best models were identified. Using Cox-regression, the interaction between Runx2 and other clinicopathological terms was tested. Runx2 LI was significantly associated only with positive Her-2 status, and did not correlate significantly with other clinicopathological parameters. Although Runx2 LI, in the continuous form and when categorized by the median, did not correlate significantly with DFS and OS; after it was categorized using the optimal cut-off points determined using ROC curve analysis, the patients with Runx2 LI >45 % showed a significantly higher event rate and shorter DFS (P = 0.047), whereas patients with Runx2 LI >40 % showed a significantly shorter OS (P = 0.050). Moreover, Runx2 LI contributed significantly in the models built to predict DFS and OS. For DFS, no interaction terms contributed significantly to the models. However, among stage IV cases, the interaction term between centred Runx2 and ER significantly contributed to the prediction of OS. Runx2 was a significant predictor of OS in this model. Runx2 has a role in biological behaviour and affects the outcome of IDC; therefore, its inhibition may be a new therapeutic strategy. The predictability of Runx2 for OS in stage IV tumours differs with different ER states. The pattern of this difference was not determined because the sample size was not sufficient to allow pattern testing."

            "abstract": "All women, regardless of their racial or ethnic origin or heritage, are at risk of developing breast cancer. Variations in breast carcinoma incidence rates among multicultural populations suggest that etiologic factors differ in their biologic expression and impact on disease outcome. Key among those factors that affect breast carcinoma development are the roles of genetics and the environment, the reproductive experience and the effects of endogenous and exogenous hormones in women, the change in immune status and host vulnerability, and the biologic determinants of breast carcinoma. Cultural dynamics, sociodemographic differences, and behavioral characteristics across population subgroups modulate how biologic disease is expressed among different races and ethnic groups. These interactions contribute to the observed variations in breast carcinoma incidence, mortality, and survival. Stage, a measure of disease status, is used to assess prognosis, plan treatment, and evaluate outcome. Numerous studies have reported a more advanced stage of breast carcinoma at diagnosis in racial/ethnic subgroups, especially among women from African American, Hispanic, American Indian, and native Hawaiian cultures. Factors associated with advanced stage at diagnosis in multicultural populations range from changes in the basic biological characteristics at the molecular and cellular level, to more complex behavioral attributes unique to a particular multicultural population, to societal issues-such as access to care and socioeconomic conditions-all of which impact on the health measure called \"stage at diagnosis.\" Rapid advancements in knowledge of cancer biology and of genetic markers and tumor products are providing new mechanisms for identifying etiologic pathways that can be utilized for better screening, detection, treatment and monitoring of disease. Further studies are needed that evaluate the biologic and molecular alterations in tumor development, progression, and response to therapy. Public health attention needs to be directed toward the societal influences that impact breast carcinoma development, as well as augmenting recognition of the need for culturally appropriate, broad-based behavioral changes at the community level. In addition, continued efforts are needed to ensure the inclusion of multicultural population subgroups and minority investigators in all aspects of research-basic, clinical and applied."

One cohort consisted of daughters whose mothers survived breast cancer and the other consisted of daughters whose mothers died from breast cancer. The results revealed significant main effects. Greater caretaking involvement was associated with higher levels of cancer-related grief. Maternal loss to breast cancer predicted higher levels of cancer-related depression. Also, a history of a depression diagnosis in the daughters was associated with current depressive symptoms. Several significant interactions also emerged. Survival status of the mother and level of daughters' involvement in mother's breast cancer was shown to significantly affect the daughters' current depressive symptoms. Daughters who reported the lowest level of involvement with their mother's breast cancer reported the highest level of current depressive symptoms. Daughters who were less than 12 years of age at the time of their mother's diagnosis reported significantly higher current state anxiety than daughters who were 12 to 19 at the time of their mother's diagnosis. Daughters whose mothers died from breast cancer, who also had a past diagnosis of depression, reported significantly higher levels of cancer-related depression than daughters without a past diagnosis of depression. We concluded that maternal death among daughters who reported very low caretaking involvement reflects the most significant vulnerability to show current depressive symptoms. We also concluded that daughters possessing potential genetic vulnerability to depression are the most sensitized to traumatic life events such as maternal illness and death."

In about 30% of the patients, however, the disease recurs, and they are at risk of death. Determination of valid new prognostic indicators would improve the ability to identify patients at high risk of recurrence. Breast cancer can entail substantial development of new blood vessels within the tumor tissue, and it is known that the growth and metastasis of solid tumors are dependent on such angiogenesis.

The relationships between VEGF concentrations and other prognostic dichotomous variables or clinical outcome were tested by the use of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and univariate and multivariate Cox analyses, respectively. The relationship between VEGF and hormone receptors (i.e., those for estrogen and progesterone) was examined by the use of Spearman's correlation analyses.

Fresh tissue was directly fixed in a zinc-based fixative to preserve lymphocyte markers and then routinely embedded in paraffin. The TIL subtypes in the sections were identified in the first immunostaining cycle by reaction with a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to lymphocyte markers CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, or CD56, followed by a modified avidin-biotin procedure and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride-H2O2 for color development. This was followed by paraformaldehyde fixation to block antibody crossreactivity. The T and Tn antigens on carcinoma cells were then demonstrated in a second staining cycle by reaction with an MAb against T or Tn antigen, followed by an indirect immunoalkaline phosphatase procedure and corresponding substrate systems for color development. The distinguishable brown color for TIL and blue or red color for T or Tn antigen enabled us to identify the TIL subsets and to describe their relations with T/Tn antigen expression in situ.

Conclusions Low level of p27Kip1 appears to be an independent prognostic factor to OS and DFS of breast cancer patients but not to RFS. Additional studies with large patient number and widely accepted practical methods are required to derive the precise prognostic significance of p27Kip1 expression in breast cancer patients."

            "abstract": "Several reproductive factors have been found to be associated with breast cancer. Based on an immunologic rather than strictly hormonal interpretation of these observations, we hypothesized that, beyond the observed associations relating to pregnancy per se, multiple marriages would be found to protect women against breast cancer. We obtained cases and controls from linked records from the Utah Cancer Registry and genealogic records. A total of 2,414 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer and 9,138 individually matched controls were included. The unadjusted odds ratio for each marriage after the first was 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.68-0.97]. After adjustment for major reproductive factors, multiple marriages were still found to reduce the risk of breast cancer (odds ratio = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.72-1.03). The findings are consistent with the operation of an immunologic mechanism in the etiology of breast cancer and suggest that the gene/antigen responsible for this effect is quite common in males. Further empirical evaluation of the fetal antigen hypothesis seems warranted."

            "abstract": "It has been extensively demonstrated that hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) constitutes an effective treatment of menopausal symptoms. There is also substantial epidemiological evidence suggesting that this treatment protects women against cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. The possible increase in breast cancer risk appears as its principal disadvantage and is often invoked as the reason why both doctors and patients decline this therapy. In this paper we review the current knowledge on HRT and breast cancer risk. A computerised bibliographical search (MEDLINE) of literature in the English language published in the last 15 years was conducted, followed by a manual search of references. We focused our attention on four main questions: 1) Does HRT increase the risk of breast cancer? 2) Are different doses and drugs associated with different risks? 3) What effect on risk have the association of a progestin does? 4) Does HRT increase the risk of breast cancer in women with major risk factors for the disease? Overall, epidemiological studies suggest that women who have used HRT before have a slightly higher risk of breast cancer than those who have never used it, in most studies not exceeding 10%. The use of HRT for less than 5 years does not seem to be associated with increased risk, while some studies have shown relative risks in the order of 1.20-1.30 with therapies exceeding 10-15 years in duration. Different doses of conjugated equine estrogens do not seem to be associated with different risks of breast cancer. Data on the risk of other estrogen preparations is scarce and far from conclusive, but the majority of studies suggest a similar risk to that of conjugated estrogens. Evidence on opposed HRT is also scarce and contradictory. A substantial body of evidence exists to suggest that HRT in women with benign breast disease does not increase the risk of breast cancer. Data on HRT in women with a family history of breast cancer is inconclusive; some studies have found an increased risk with this therapy, while others have found no difference. It has to be taken into account that current knowledge on this subject is based on observational studies subject to numerous bias, evaluating dissimilar populations and mostly conducted with currently less favoured HRT regimens, such as unopposed conjugated estrogens. Studies on the currently prevailing HRT regimens are urgently needed."

The extent of carcinoma was larger than the diameter of the area of microcalcifications in 14 cases (53.8%) and almost equal in five cases. When the maximum diameter of the area of microcalcifications was less than 2.5cm, carcinoma extended no more than 1.5cm beyond the diameter of the microcalcifications. Employing 24 cases subjected to excision biopsy, the extent of carcinoma was compared with the diameter of the area of microcalcifications on sectioned material containing microcalcifications, and it was found that carcinoma tended to extend further than the extent of calcifications (62.5%). Mammographic microcalcifications obtained from 37 breast cancer cases not accompanied by any associated mass were analyzed in contrast to their previous survey films. Twelve cases were found to have shown several extremely faint calcifications on the previous survey films.

            "abstract": "Abundant evidence has shown that tumor growth and metastasis are dependent upon tumor angiogenesis (TA). TA refers to the growth of new vessels toward and within the tumor. Until TA occurs, tumors grow no larger than 2-4 mm in diameter. Also, TA is necessary at the beginning and at the end of the metastatic cascade of events. Thus, it seems reasonable that increasing intratumoral microvascular density (iMVD) might correlate with greater tumor aggressiveness, such as a higher frequency of metastases and/or decreased survival. Indeed, in 1991 my colleagues and I reported a statistically significant association between greater incidence of metastases in patients with breast carcinoma and increasing iMVD. Microvessel density was measured with a light microscope in a single area of invasive tumor (200x field or 0.74 mm2) representative of the highest microvessel density (neovascular \"hot spot\"). This was done after endothelial cells, lining the microvessels, had been highlighted with anti-factor VIII-related antigen/von Willebrand's factor (F8RA/vWF). Subsequent studies by other investigators, using either anti-F8RA/vWF or other relatively vessel-specific reagents such as anti-CD31, have shown that the association of greater tumor aggressiveness with increasing iMVD exists not only in breast carcinoma, but also in other solid tumors. This article reviews the methods of highlighting intratumoral vessels and describes the techniques for counting these vessels for assessing iMVD."

In this study, we analysed p53 mRNA expression, LOH at 17p13 and TP53 mutations from exons 2 to 11 in 206 patients with breast carcinoma and correlated the results with disease-free and overall survival. The observed mutations were classified according to their type and location in the three protein domains (transactivation domain, DNA binding domain, oligomerization domain) and correlated with disease-free and overall survival. In our population, neither p53 mRNA expression nor LOH correlated with outcome. Concerning TP53 mutations, 27% of tumours were mutated (53/197) and the presence of a mutation in the TP53 gene was associated with worse overall survival (p = 0.0026) but not with disease-free survival (p = 0.0697), with median survival of 80 months and 78 months, respectively. When alterations were segregated into mutation categories and locations, and related to survival, tumours harbouring mutations other than missense mutations in the DNA binding domain of P53 had the same survival profiles as wild-type tumours. Concerning missense mutations in the DNA binding domain, median disease-free and overall survival was 23 months and 35 months, respectively (p = 0.0021 and p<0.0001, respectively), compared with 78 and 80 months in mutated tumours overall. This work shows that disease-free and overall survival in patients with a frameshift mutation of TP53 or missense mutation in the oligomerization domain are the same as those in wild-type TP53 patients."

Surgery consisted in a wide tumorectomy, with intraoperative control of R0 margins. The total postoperative radiation dosage was 50 Gy on the whole breast, associated with a boost of 10 Gy on tumor bed (20 Gy in T2 neoplasms). Before 1997 node-positive patients were treated with axillary irradiation with 50 Gy. Postoperative chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy were administered to patients according with node-involvement, age and menopausal status.

These epidemiological statistics highlight the overwhelming clinical dilemma of breast cancer and emphasize the need for novel therapeutic targets and prevention strategies.

Excessive IL-6 has been demonstrated in primary breast tumors and breast cancer patient sera and is associated with poor clinical outcomes in breast cancer. These clinical associations are corroborated by emerging preclinical data revealing that IL-6 is a potent growth factor and promotes an epithelial-mesenchyme (EMT) phenotype in breast cancer cells to indicate that IL-6 in the breast tumor microenvironment is clinically relevant.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      High serum levels of interleukin-6 correlate with poor outcome in breast cancer patients.

Mammospheres (MS) from node invasive breast carcinoma tissues express IL-6 mRNA at higher levels than MS from matched non-neoplastic mammary glands. IL-6 mRNA is detectable only in basal-like breast carcinoma tissues; our results reveal that IL-6 triggers a Notch-3-dependent upregulation of the Notch ligand Jagged-1, whose interaction with Notch-3 promotes the growth of MS and Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7)-derived spheroids.

We examined global DNA methylation levels using a sibling design in 273 sisters affected with breast cancer and 335 unaffected sisters from the New York site of the Breast Cancer Family Registry. We measured global DNA methylation in total white blood cell (WBC) and granulocyte DNA by two different methods, the [ ( 3) H]-methyl acceptance assay and the luminometric methylation assay (LUMA). Global methylation levels were only modestly correlated between sisters discordant for breast cancer (Spearman correlation coefficients ranged from -0.08 to 0.24 depending on assay and DNA source). Using conditional logistic regression models, women in the quartile with the lowest DNA methylation levels (as measured by the [ ( 3) H]-methyl acceptance assay) had a 1.8-fold (95% CI = 1.0-3.3) higher relative association with breast cancer than women in the quartile with the highest DNA methylation levels. When we examined the association on a continuous scale, we also observed a positive association (odds ratio, OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.0-1.7, for a one unit change in the natural logarithm of the DPM/μg of DNA). We observed no association between measures by the LUMA assay and breast cancer risk.

Pathologists and gynecologists should be aware of this possibility in women who have a history of breast carcinoma and who are receiving tamoxifen. Careful histologic evaluation of the endometrium is crucial."

The primary purpose of this article is to describe a patient with previously diagnosed and treated invasive ductal breast carcinoma who developed a metastatic lesion in the maxillary gingiva. In addition, this article presents a brief literature review of case reports on metastatic breast cancer manifestations in the gingiva. In the present case, a 68-year-old woman had been diagnosed and treated for invasive ductal breast carcinoma. At the 6-month follow-up after treatment for breast cancer, she complained of pain in the right leg and spine, swelling in the right arm associated with redness, and a nodular growth in the maxillary gingiva that was painful, friable, and associated with tooth mobility. Imaging examinations and microscopic analysis of an oral biopsy specimen revealed disease progression to the oral cavity, femur, lung, and brain. Because of the advanced disease, the patient died within a few weeks. The literature review identified 6 articles that reported varied clinical presentations of metastatic breast cancer in the gingiva. Invasive ductal carcinoma was the most common histologic type. Routine dental follow-up of patients with cancer is essential for the identification and diagnosis of oral lesions to ensure early intervention for lesions that may be distant metastases mimicking benign lesions."

            "abstract": "High rates of mutation in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene have been found in many human cancers, including breast tumors, making p53 one of the most studied proteins in oncology. However, the prognostic and predictive value of alterations in this gene remains ambiguous. To analyze the clinical value of somatic TP53 mutations, we collected clinical and molecular data on 210 women with primary breast cancer. We found significant associations of p53 mutations with tumor grade, metastasis, molecular subtype, Her2 status and inverse correlations with estrogen and progesterone receptor status. Cox proportional hazard analysis confirmed a strong prognostic value of p53 mutation for overall survival rate and highlighted significant interactions with lymph node involvement and tumor size. In relation to treatment options, TP53 mutations were associated with poor response to anthracyclines and radiotherapy. Categorization of TP53 mutations according to their type and location revealed that patients with nonsense mutation have the poorest prognosis in comparison with wild-type cases and other types of mutations in this gene. Classification of TP53 mutations with respect to the degree of disturbance of protein structure showed association of disruptive mutations with poorer patients' outcome in contrast to wild-type and non-disruptive mutations. In conclusion, the present study confirms p53 as a potential predictive and prognostic factor in oncology practice and highlights the growing evidence that distinct types of mutations have different clinical impacts."

Core pathologic findings associated with malignancy were benign papilloma (n=1), sclerotic papilloma (n=1), micropapilloma (n=2), and atypical papilloma (n=10). Frequency of malignancy was one (3%) of 38 benign papillomas, 10 (67%) of 15 atypical papillomas, two (50%) of four micropapillomas, and one (17%) of six sclerotic papillomas. Excisional findings included lobular carcinoma in situ (n=2), ductal carcinoma in situ (n=7), papillary carcinoma (n=2), and invasive ductal carcinoma (n=3).

            "abstract": "A shared characteristic of tumor cells is their exacerbated growth. Consequently, tumor cells demand high rates of phospholipid synthesis required for membrane biogenesis to support their growth. c-Fos, in addition to its AP-1 transcription factor activity, is the only protein known up to date that is capable of activating lipid synthesis in normal and brain tumor tissue. For this latter activity, c-Fos associates to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through its N-terminal domain and activates phospholipid synthesis, an event that requires it Basic Domain (BD) (aa 139-159). Fra-1, another member of the FOS family of proteins, is over-expressed in human breast cancer cells and its BD is highly homologous to that of c-Fos with two conservative substitutions in its basic amino acids. Consequently, herein we examined if Fra-1 and/or c-Fos participate in growth of breast cancer cells by activating phospholipid synthesis as found previously for c-Fos in brain tumors. We found both Fra-1 and c-Fos over-expressed in >95% of human ductal breast carcinoma biopsies examined contrasting with the very low or undetectable levels in normal tissue. Furthermore, both proteins associate to the ER and activate phospholipid synthesis in cultured MCF7 and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells and in human breast cancer samples. Stripping tumor membranes of Fra-1 and c-Fos prior to assaying their lipid synthesis capacity in vitro results in non-activated lipid synthesis levels that are restored to their initial activated state by addition of Fra-1 and/or c-Fos to the assays. In MDA-MB231 cells primed to proliferate, blocking Fra-1 and c-Fos with neutralizing antibodies blocks lipid-synthesis activation and cells do not proliferate. Taken together, these results disclose the cytoplasmic activity of Fra-1 and c-Fos as potential targets for controlling growth of breast carcinomas by decreasing the rate of membrane biogenesis required for growth."

Studying breast cancer cell lines, we also found strong cytoplasmatic CML staining that was again independent of their invasive or metastatic behavior. Our results reveal that tumor cells show a strong cytoplasmatic immunoreactivity to CML without evident association with breast carcinoma type, differentiation, tumor stage, or intratumoral localization.

There is also a dearth of studies assessing the response of metaplastic breast carcinoma to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Cases of metaplastic breast carcinoma diagnosed between 2007 and 2017 were identified. Various clinical-pathologic variables were tested for association with survival. Patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy were assessed for pathologic response. Median age at diagnosis with metaplastic breast carcinoma was 64 years. With a median follow-up of 39 months, 26 patients (27%) recurred (24 distant and 2 loco-regional). The overall survival rate of the cohort was 66% (64/97). A number of variables were associated with survival in univariable analysis; however, in multivariable analysis, only lymph node status and tumor size (pT3 vs. pT1/2) were significantly associated with all survival endpoints: recurrence-free survival, distant recurrence-free survival, overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival. Twenty-nine of 97 (30%) patients with metaplastic breast carcinoma received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Five (17%) patients achieved pathologic complete response. Matrix-producing morphology was associated with higher probability of achieving pathologic complete response (p = 0.027). Similar to other breast cancer subtypes, tumor size and lymph node status are prognostic in metaplastic carcinomas.

Benign breast disease (BBD), particularly atypical hyperplasia, is also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. However, the relationship between family history of breast cancer and BBD is unclear. From 1989 through 1997, 80,995 participants in the Nurses' Health Study II were followed; 16,849 reported a first diagnosis of BBD. Pathology slides were reviewed for 1,465 women who reported having a tissue biopsy, and these were classified as nonproliferative BBD, proliferative BBD without atypia or atypical hyperplasia. Women with a family history of breast cancer were more likely to report a physician diagnosis of BBD [rate ratio (RR) = 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-1.46]. The magnitude of this association declined with age from RR = 1.96 (95% CI 1.55-2.47) at 25-29 years to RR = 1.20 (95% CI 0.95-1.52) at age 45-50 years. Among women with proliferative disease, those with a family history of breast cancer were almost 3 times as likely to have atypia (prevalence odds ratio = 2.72, 95% CI 1.23-5.89) than those with no family history. In conclusion, women with a family history of breast cancer appear to be at increased risk of being diagnosed with BBD, in particular the high-risk types of BBD associated with a greatly increased risk of breast cancer. This link adds weight to the belief that BBD with atypia is a precursor or marker lesion for breast cancer."

In an attempt to narrow down the relevant regions of LOH on chromosome 17, we have studied the deletion pattern and its association with clinical parameters in 1280 breast carcinoma-venous blood lymphocyte pairs. In total, 42 different chromosome 17 loci were investigated, and between 25 and 625 cases were analyzed at each locus. The frequency of LOH observed on the p arm was much higher than that observed on the q arm. The opposite effect was observed in 52 ovarian cancer cases investigated, with less LOH on 17p than on 17q. Patterns of loss consistent with interstitial and terminal deletions, as well as loss of either the p or q arm or monosomy 17 were observed. To determine whether loss at particular loci may be associated with biological features of breast tumors, clinical data including age of onset, family history of breast cancer, tumor histopathology, tumor size, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and occurrence of lymph node or distant metastases were collected for each case. Overall, large-sized, ER-negative, lymph node-positive ductal tumors showed the highest frequencies of LOH, with ER-negative and ductal tumors showing LOH for markers along the majority of the chromosome. Eight regions of chromosome 17 appear to be associated with human breast cancer, two on 17p and six on 17q. These regions were not necessarily in the areas exhibiting the highest frequencies of LOH but were defined by interstitial and terminal deletions in multiple independent cases. Seven of these regions showed statistically significant differences in LOH associated with clinical parameters. These data strongly suggest that loci on chromosome 17 may determine aspects of tumor presentation and disease behavior in human breast cancer and pinpoint candidate tumor suppressor gene loci."

In the former there was a highly significant prognostic difference between those with moderate infiltration, which was of poor short-term prognosis, and those with other degrees of infiltration (none, slight and marked). Thus, lymphocyte infiltration in breast cancer can give information on both good and poor prognosis in over 80% of cases if its site and degree are taken into consideration. The remaining cases are histologically distinct. Their survival was similar to that in the total material. The mechanisms involved are as yet open to speculation.

These proteins were detected by immunoperoxidase techniques in 126 breast carcinomas that had been evaluated clinically for more than six years. Alpha-2-Zn-glycoprotein was present in 58% of the carcinomas, whereas alpha 1-antichymotrypsin was seen in 55% and alpha-lipoprotein in 52%. These markers showed a relationship with clinical outcome. Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and alpha-lipoprotein were unfavorable determinants, whereas alpha 2-Zn-glycoprotein was detected in lesions with a favorable evolution. Taken individually, these markers have similar but rather weak associations with five-year survival rates; roughly 20% of patients in the \"favorable\" group died, compared with 33% in the \"unfavorable\" group. Alpha-2-Zn-glycoprotein in grade 1 tumors was a marker with marginally favorable significance, but alpha 1-antichymotrypsin significantly worsened the prognosis of grade 2 and 3 tumors. Furthermore, stratification of patients according to the number of positive unfavorable markers yielded striking results. Eight percent of patients with none of the unfavorable markers were dead at five years, compared with 55% of those whose lesions expressed three unfavorable markers."

This question was explored by analyzing the data pertaining to 880 women with invasive breast carcinoma. Patients with multicentric carcinoma had bilateral disease more often than those whose carcinoma was apparently limited to a single quadrant. Among women who had lobular carcinoma in situ coexisting with infiltrating duct carcinoma or infiltrating lobular carcinoma, bilaterality and multicentricity were significantly more common than they were among patients whose only lesion was infiltrating duct or medullary cancer. Other variables associated with bilaterality and multicentricity were degree of ductal differentiation, tumor size, nodal status, type of tumor margin, intensity of lymphoid infiltrate, and menstrual status. Age at diagnosis and estrogen receptors were related to bilaterality but not to multicentricity. The following variables proved to be unrelated to bilaterality and multicentricity: family history of breast carcinoma, height, weight, and parity. The data obtained in this study tend to support a conclusion that multicentricity and bilaterality are manifestations of similar factors involved in the neoplastic transformation of mammary gland epithelium leading to the development of breast cancer."

Aggregation of breast cancer occurs also in families diagnosed for cancer at sites different from the breast. Therefore, the familial association of histology specific breast cancers with cancers at other sites is of great interest. The nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database was used to calculate standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for breast cancer when parents or sibling were diagnosed with cancer at the most common sites. Significant SIRs were found when parents had breast, ovarian, laryngeal, endometrial, prostate, lung and colon cancers. If women were diagnosed before the age of 50 years, the SIRs were significant when parents were diagnosed with breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers, and leukaemia, and when siblings were diagnosed with squamous cell skin, pancreatic, breast and endometrial cancers. If mothers were diagnosed with breast cancer, histology-specific SIRs were ranked as comedo > tubular > ductal > lobular; SIR for medullary carcinoma was not significant but it was high when mothers presented with ovarian cancer. Other associations were between the upper aerodigestive tract and lobular, colon and comedo, larynx and ductal cancer. Moreover, cervical cancer was associated with comedo and endometrial cancer with the medullary histology.

Syndecan-1 was detected in 72.8% of cases, with significant association between its expression and histological tumor type (p<0.05) and high grade tumors (p<0.05). Syndecan-4 was expressed in 66.7% of cases; expression correlated significantly with positive estrogen (p<0.01) and progesterone (p<0.01) receptor status. Independent expression of the two syndecans was noted from an analysis of single and double positive cases. There was a statistical relationship between syndecan-1 presence in high-grade tumors and absence of syndecan-4, whereas syndecan-4 presence in cases positive for estrogen and progesterone receptor associated with syndecan-1 absence.

The tumors are subclassified into well-differentiated and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, and invasive breast carcinoma with neuroendocrine features. Well-differentiated tumors show architectural similarity to carcinoids of other sites but lack characteristic neuroendocrine nuclei. Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors are morphologically identical to small cell carcinoma of the lung. Neuroendocrine differentiation, seen in up to 30% of invasive breast carcinomas, is most commonly associated with mucinous and solid papillary carcinomas. The diagnosis of neuroendocrine differentiation requires expression of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin or chromogranin. The main differential diagnosis is a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor from an extramammary site. Neuroendocrine tumors of the breast are treated similarly to other invasive breast carcinomas.

Amplification of the gene has been described in a variety of human adenocarcinomas and is particularly well documented in breast carcinoma. It has been suggested that amplification is indicative of poor prognosis and, as such, is comparable with lymph node status as a predictor of clinical outcome. This study examines the suggestion indirectly by an immunohistochemical technique. Archival tissue from 195 patients with primary breast carcinoma was stained with the polyclonal antibody 21N, raised to amino acids 1243-1255, the C-terminus of the predicted amino acid sequence of the c-erbB-2 protein. Up to 10 year verified follow-up data were available on all patients. Staining compatible with significant amplification was observed in 17 patients. Using the chi-squared test for trend a significant correlation was found between staining and grade (P = 0.04) but not with either node or receptor status. No significant association was found between staining and clinical outcome although there was a tendency for patients with stained tumours to have a worse prognosis. A Cox regression analysis was used to adjust for node status and grade and still no correlation was revealed between staining and prognosis. However a study of this size in which only a small number of patients have been found to have stained tumours does have wide confidence limits. Comparable staining observed in in situ and infiltrating components of tumours suggests that amplification is an early event in carcinogenesis. Similar staining in primary and subsequent metastatic lesions was also noted.

The analysis is based on 193 cases and 400 controls. Breast cancer risk was found to be directly related to educational attainment. There was an increased risk associated with early menarche and late menopause. The most striking finding was the strong inverse relationship between risk and parity; women who had six or more children have only one-third the breast cancer risk of married women who had less than four children. This association is not confounded by case-control differences in age at birth of first child. The association of breast cancer risk with age at first birth was not striking; only women with a first birth after age 30 were at increased risk. Breast cancer risk was unrelated to lactation. Overall, the epidemiology of breast cancer in Burma is similar to that in most other countries.

We investigated the association of surgeon-related factors with receipt of adjuvant radiotherapy after BCS.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We used the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database to identify women aged 65 years or older with stage I/II breast cancer who were diagnosed between 1991 and 2002 and underwent BCS. We collected demographic and clinical data from SEER and treatment information from Medicare claims data. The American Medical Association Masterfile was used to obtain information on surgeons' characteristics, including sex, medical school location (United States or elsewhere), and type of degree (MD or Doctorate in Osteopathic Medicine [DO]). The associations of patient (age, race, rural vs urban residence, comorbidities, marital status), tumor (hormone receptor status, grade, stage), and surgeon-related factors with receipt of adjuvant radiotherapy were analyzed using Generalized Estimating Equations to control for clustering. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 29,760 women in our sample, 22,207 (75%) received radiotherapy. Patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy were younger, had fewer comorbidities, and were more likely to be white, married, from an urban area, and diagnosed in a later year compared with those who did not. They were also more likely to have a surgeon who was female (79% vs 73%), had an MD degree (75% vs 68%), or was US trained (75% vs 70%). The multivariable analysis confirmed the association of radiotherapy with having a surgeon who was female (odds ratio [OR] = 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06 to 1.27), had an MD degree (OR = 1.55; 95% CI = 1.24 to 1.91), was US trained (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.25), or had more than 15 patients (OR = 1.18; 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.28).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Surgeon characteristics were associated with patients' receipt of adjuvant radiotherapy after BCS after controlling for patient and tumor characteristics, although the individual effect sizes were small for surgeon sex, location of training, and type of medical degree. More research is warranted to confirm the associations to determine whether they reflect surgeon behavior, patient response, or physician-patient interactions."

In total, 492 patients presented to the Nottingham City Hospital with metastatic breast carcinoma between July 1997 and December 2001. Of these, 267 patients had bone metastases at presentation with metastatic disease, 91 patients in this group had bone as their only site of metastatic disease. Sites of first presentation of metastatic disease were prospectively recorded, as were histological features of the primary tumour (tumour type, histological grade, lymph node stage, tumour size and oestrogen receptor (ER) status). The radiological features of the bone metastases, the metastasis-free interval and serological tumour marker levels at presentation with metastases were all recorded. There was a significant association between the development of bone metastases and lower grade tumours (P=0.019), ER-positive tumours (P<0.0001) and the lymph node stage of the primary tumour (P=0.047). A multivariate analysis found that metastasis-free interval, additional sites of metastatic disease other than bone, ER status and serological tumour marker levels all independently contributed to survival from time of presentation with bone metastases."

            "abstract": "Premenopausal bilateral breast cancer is characterized by a strong family risk, and, consequently, a high probability that inherited susceptibility genes may be segregating in these families. Determining whether risk factors that affect other breast cancer cases have a similar effect in the etiology of bilateral breast cancer is of interest. Therefore, as part of an ongoing genetic-epidemiologic study of premenopausal bilateral breast cancer, we conducted a case-control analysis of reproductive variables, benign breast disease, alcohol, and smoking. Cases had premenopausal bilateral breast cancer, and their unaffected sisters served as controls. A set of reproductive variables--including earlier age at menarche, nulliparity, and late age at first full term pregnancy--appeared to increase the risk of breast cancer; the corresponding confidence limits, however, were wide and straddled the null. In addition, other variables associated with increased premenopausal bilateral breast cancer risk were: use of oral contraceptives, history of benign breast disease, and high alcohol consumption. We found no positive association for smoking. Nulliparity and late age at first full-term pregnancy appeared to have different effects in women with family histories of breast cancer than in women without such a history. We detected no substantial effect modification for the other risk factors. In general, risk factors previously identified for breast cancer (usually postmenopausal, unilateral cases) appear also to increase the risk for premenopausal, bilateral breast cancer."

During 16 years of follow-up, 806 women were diagnosed with breast carcinoma prior to menopause, and another 1485 were diagnosed after menopause. Because adolescent growth was not directly observed in this cohort, the peak height growth velocity for each participant was estimated by using a model from another longitudinal study.

Higher peak height growth velocity, derived from these 3 variables, was associated with increased risk of both premenopausal (RR = 1.31 for highest vs. lowest quintile) and postmenopausal (RR = 1.40) breast carcinoma. These analyses controlled for birth cohort, other possible risk factors from the adolescent period, and family history. These associations persisted after controlling for age at the birth of a first child, parity, adult adiposity, and age at menopause.

The associations between the levels of HER2-AAbs and breast cancer risk, and recurrence-free survival, were examined.

The association of AR expression with different histological and surrogate molecular subtypes was analyzed. Results: The positive expression rate of AR in the immunohistochemistry-based surrogate subtypes was 96.3%(207/215) for Luminal A, 89.8%(378/421) for Luminal B, 82.4%(75/91) for HER2 overexpression and 37.1%(53/143) for triple negative breast carcinoma, with significant differences among the four groups (P<0.01).

However, studies on these cell cycle regulators in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) have been extremely limited. Therefore, we studied the immunohistochemical expression of p21, p27 and cyclin D1 proteins in 49 DCIS cases and compared the findings with the clinicopathologic parameters (age, tumor size, gross type, histologic type, histologic grade, necrosis and mitotic index), p53 and estrogen receptor (ER) status. A significant correlation was found between positive p21 immunoreactivity (67.3% of the cases) and well-differentiated histologic grade, non-comedo type, ER-positive and p53-negative (p53-) status. DCIS with p21+/p53- is likely to be the non-comedo type. The overexpression of cyclin D1 (59.2% of the cases) correlated positively with the ER expression (P = 0.001). The p27 protein expression (46.9% of the cases) correlated with the cyclin D1 immunopositivity (P = 0.0003) and ER expression (P = 0.005). No significant associations were seen in the p27 or cyclin D1 expression and other clinicopathologic parameters. Our results suggest that p21 might be more related to the useful biologic markers in DCIS than p27 or cyclin D1. The significant positive association between p21, p27 or cyclin D1 and ER status, and close association of p27 and cyclin D1 expression might be implicated in the tumor biology of DCIS."

We assessed here immunohistochemical expression of PHD1-3 and HIF-1α and 2α in patients with invasive ductal breast carcinoma (n = 102) and correlated their expression levels with main clinical prognostic factors and survival. PHD1 expression correlated with high proliferation, and these tumors were mainly estrogen receptor-negative. PHD3 expression declined in tumors of large size, poor differentiation, and high proliferation. There was a tendency for increased breast cancer-specific survival and longer disease-free survival among patients with high tumor PHD2 expression. Surprisingly, PHD1-3 expression did not correlate with HIF-1α or HIF-2α downregulation. However, HIF-2α expression correlated independently with low tumor stage and HIF-1α expression had a tendency for decreased breast cancer-specific survival. PHD1 and 3 appear to be HIF-independent factors in breast cancer. Not all PHD1 associated proliferation is estrogen-dependent and it is associated with a poor prognosis of cancer. PHD3 may be an important regulator of apoptosis and it is mainly found in tumors with good prognosis. PHD2 expression is likely to be involved in increased survival."

Reports of children's emotional and behavioural problems were obtained from patient mothers, their healthy partners, the children's teacher and adolescents using the Child Behaviour Checklist and Mental Health subscale of the Child Health Questionnaire. Parents reported on their own level of depression and, for patients only, their quality of life. Family functioning was assessed using the Family Assessment Device and Cohesion subscale of the Family Environment Scale. Using a cross-sectional within groups design, assessments were obtained (N=107 families) where the patients were 3-36 months postdiagnosis. Risk of problems in children were linked with low levels of family cohesion, low affective responsiveness and parental over-involvement as reported by both child and mother. Adolescents reported family communication issues, which were associated with externalising behaviour problems. Maternal depression was related to child internalising problems, particularly in girls. Whether the mother was currently on or off chemotherapy was not associated with child problems nor was time since cancer diagnosis. These findings held across child age. Where mothers have early stage breast cancer, a substantial minority of their school-aged children have emotional and behavioural problems.

DATE SOURCE/STUDY SETTING: Using the 1992 Health and Retirement Study, we estimate the probability of working using probit regression and then, for women who are employed, we estimate regressions for average weekly hours worked using ordinary least squares (OLS). We control for health status by using responses to perceived health status and comorbidities. For a sample of married women, we control for spouses' employer-based health insurance. We also perform additional analyses to detect selection bias in our sample.\n    \n\n\n          Principal findings:\n        \n      \n      We find that the probability of breast cancer survivors working is 10 percentage points less than that for women without breast cancer. Among women who work, breast cancer survivors work approximately three more hours per week than women who do not have cancer. Results of similar magnitude persist after health status is controlled in the analysis, and although we could not definitively rule out selection bias, we could not find evidence that our results are attributable to selection bias.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      For some women, breast cancer may impose an economic hardship because it causes them to leave theirjobs. However, for women who survive and remain working, this study failed to show a negative effect on hours worked associated with breast cancer.

            "abstract": "The prognostic factors in breast cancer are numerous and interdependent. The single most important variable is the total tumor cell burden as well as the marked heterogeneity of tumor cell population. In women with clinical localized disease, the progressive increase in the diameter of primary tumor is associated with higher incidence of histologically involved axillary nodes; in turn, this involvement, and particolarly its extent, represents an indirect sign of distant micrometastases. In women with clinical advanced disease, the extent of tumor cell burden (inflammatory carcinoma, multivisceral involvement) is associated with a decrease in the response rate by drug therapy. The percent of drug-resistant neoplastic cells is inversely related to the tumor mass; this resistant fraction represents today the limiting factor to a more effective contribution of medical treatment (i.e. long-term complete remission and cure) in all stages of breast cancer. The concept of breast cancer as systemic disease in a higher percent of women than thought in the past, allows to perform breast-saving procedures without affecting prognosis and stimulates treatment strategies utilizing a combined modality approach for high-risk women."

In the breast, PEH has been documented but is rare. PEH is notorious for being misdiagnosed as angiosarcoma due to its complex growth pattern, papillary processes and interlacing vascular channels. The occurrence of PEH years after breast irradiation constitutes a pathological and clinical diagnostic challenge because angiosarcoma is far more common in this setting. The most important features that differentiate papillary endothelial hyperplasia from angiosarcoma are its presentation as a round nodule without infiltrative borders, its localization inside a vessel or in association with thrombus, and the lack of significant cytologic atypia or areas of solid growth, even in the presence of a complex architecture. Clinical history and site of involvement (cutaneous versus parenchymal) are usually of help to establish a correct diagnosis. Herein, we describe two cases of PEH presenting in patients with history of breast carcinoma and breast radiation therapy. The clinical and morphological features as well as the differential diagnoses are discussed.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the cytological criteria in fine-needle aspiration biopsy and to identify their association with the basal phenotype of breast carcinoma. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens and tissue sections (mastectomy specimen) from 74 cases of high-grade invasive ductal breast carcinomas were consecutively retrieved from the files of three institutions. Breast carcinomas were studied using the tissue microarray technique, being classified into phenotypes: luminal A, luminal B, HER2 overexpression, and basal. The cytological criteria for all cases were reviewed blindly by two pathologists according to five cytological criteria: cellularity, cell pattern, presence of necrosis, nucleoli, and nuclear atypia. Exact Fisher test was used to test the association between cytological criteria and the phenotypes of breast carcinoma. Necrosis was present in 64.7% of basal breast carcinomas, and 31.1% of nonbasal breast carcinomas, and that result was statistically significant, showing an odds ratio (OR) of 3.80.

The material was based on consecutive patients operated for meningioma at Tampere University Hospital in 1989-1999. The occurrence of progesterone, estrogen and androgen receptor in patients with primary and recurrent meningiomas was studied immunohistochemically by using specific monoclonal antibodies. Hormonal status was determined in 510 tumor samples. 443 samples were from primary meningiomas and 67 from recurrent tumors.

Grade I meningiomas had significantly higher incidence for estrogen and androgen receptors than higher grade meningiomas. Estrogen positive tumor samples had significantly higher proliferation index than estrogen negative samples. No difference in expression of sex hormone receptors was observed by sexes or age group. Estrogen and androgen receptors may have more influence on the pathogenesis of meningiomas than earlier thought.

We constructed the PRS using a family-based study of 1,291 women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50 and their parents and unaffected sisters.

In further analyses we assessed the same interactions, but for invasive cancer, estrogen receptor (ER) positive cancer and with broader inclusion of racial/ethnic groups. Results showed a decreased association between the PRS and YOBC risk for women who had ever used hormonal birth control (odds ratio [OR] = 2.20 versus 3.89) and a stronger association between the PRS and YOBC risk in pre-menopausal women (OR = 2.46 versus 1.23).

            "abstract": "Female gender, contraceptives, and menopausal hormone replacement treatments containing progesterone analogues associate with higher risk of meningiomas yet with lower risk of gliomas. Progesterone receptor (PR) expression and mifepristone treatment was highly discussed for meningiomas. However, much less is known in regard to progesterone actions in gliomas despite PR expression strongly correlates with their grade. Meningiomas and gliomas may grow faster during gestation; but paradoxically, parousity reduces lifetime risk of gliomas which can be explained with dichotomous cell growth-stimulating and inhibitory actions of progesterone at low versus high levels. Progesterone levels gradually increase in gestation up to 200-fold and the incidence of highly angiogenic brain tumors decreases in the last trimester. Indeed, progesterone stimulates glial tumor cell growth at low doses (10 nM) while induces cell kill at higher doses. During gestation, some immune pathways are activated to protect the mother and the fetus against microbial pathogens. In parallel, high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) used in treatment of endometrial carcinoma decreases tumoral expression of PR-B and increases infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. MPA also synergies with IL-2 in clinical treatment of renal cancer. In both glioma and meningioma, the dominant cytosolic PR is PR-B which increases cell growth, while PR-A limits cell growth. This seems also paradoxical at the first glance due to opposite behavior of these tumors in diverse endocrine conditions. High-dose progestins may inhibit brain tumor growth by downregulating PR-B, yet the dosage thresholds may differ between glial and meningeal tumors due to higher total PR expression in meningiomas. Supporting this proposal, certain progestins were reported to stimulate meningioma growth in anecdotal reports, but same agents at much higher doses reduced meningioma cell proliferation in pilot clinical studies. PR antagonist mifepristone reduced meningioma growth in some clinical studies, but lacked efficacy in others. In fact, mifepristone also has partial PR agonist efficacy and acts in synergy with MPA to block EC growth. Hence, a similar mechanism of receptor downregulation may also account for mifepristone. Both MPA and mifepristone also harbor myeloprotective features against chemotherapy. Ulipristal is another contraceptive PR antagonist and exerts promising anticancer activity on drug-resistant ovarian cancer and BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cells, which can be tested in animal glioblastoma models. We propose that progestins strongly deserve to be investigated in experimental models of glioblastoma alone and in combination with immunostimulating agents."

Immunohistochemical expression of CD44 and CD24 alone or in combination was investigated in 95 IDC cases arranged in a tissue microarray (TMA). The association with subgroups defined as luminal A and B; HER2 rich and triple negative, or with the other markers and prognosis was analyzed. CD44+/CD24- and CD44-/CD24+ were respectively present in 8.4% and 16.8% of the tumors, a lack of both proteins was detected in 6.3%, while CD44+/CD24+ was observed in 45.3% of the tumors. Although there was no significant correlation between subgroups and different phenotypes, the CD44+/CD24- phenotype was more common in the basal subgroups but absent in HER2 tumors, whereas luminal tumors are enriched in CD44-/CD24+ and CD44+/CD24+ cells. The frequency of CD44+/CD24- or CD44-/CD24+ was not associated with clinical characteristics or biological markers. There was also no significant association of these phenotypes with the event free (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Single CD44+ was evident in 57.9% of the tumors and was marginally associated to grading and not to any other tumor characteristics as well as OS and DFS. CD24+ was positive in 74.7% of the tumors, showing a significant association with estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Ki-67 and a marginal association with CK18 and claudin-7. Expression of claudin-7 and Ki-67 did not associate with the cancer subgroups, while a positive association between CK18 and the luminal subgroups was found (P=0.03). CK5, CK18 and Ki-67 expression had no influence in OS or DFS. Single CD24+ (P=0.07) and claudin-7 positivity (P=0.05) were associated with reduced time of recurrence, suggesting a contribution of these markers to aggressiveness of breast cancer."

Mounting evidence suggests the importance of CITED in the progression of human malignancies, but the significance of CITED2 protein has not yet been examined in breast carcinoma. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the clinical significance and the biological functions of CITED2 in breast carcinoma by immunohistochemistry and in vitro study. CITED2 immunoreactivity was detected in breast carcinoma tissues, and it was significantly higher compared to those in morphologically normal mammary glands. CITED2 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with stage, pathological T factor, lymph node metastasis, histological grade, HER2 and Ki-67, and inversely correlated with estrogen receptor. Moreover, the immunohistochemical CITED2 status was significantly associated with increased incidence of recurrence and breast cancer-specific death of the breast cancer patients, and multivariate analyses demonstrated CITED2 status as an independent worse prognostic factor for disease-free and breast cancer-specific survival. Subsequent in vitro experiments showed that CITED2 expression significantly increased proliferation activity and migration property in MCF-7and S KBR-3 breast carcinoma cells. Moreover, CITED2 caused chemoresistance to epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil, but not paclitaxel, in these cells, and it inhibited p53 accumulation after 5-fluorouracil treatment in MCF-7 cells. These results suggest that CITED2 plays important roles in the progression and chemoresistance of breast carcinoma and that CITED2 status is a potent prognostic factor in breast cancer patients."

Stratification of data analysis based on menopausal status revealed significant associations between obesity and each of tumor stage and grade among postmenopausal but not premenopausal patients (P=0.019 and P=0.031, respectively). Similarly, postmenopausal obese patients had significantly higher prognostic scores compared to nonobese counterparts (P=0.007), indicating worse prognosis, a finding which was also absent among premenopausal breast cancer patients. No significant association between BMI with expression status of hormone receptors, HER2, lymphovascular invasion, and molecular subtypes was found among patients. BMI was a significant predictor for disease recurrence in which obese breast cancer patients had greater odds (2-fold) to develop locoregional and distant recurrence compared to nonobese cases (P=0.011).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Obesity was associated with advanced stage and grade of breast carcinoma at diagnosis. The impact of BMI on clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis was confined to postmenopausal cases. Jordanian obese breast cancer patients are at greater risk of breast cancer recurrence and reduced survival compared to their nonobese counterparts."

            "abstract": "Neovascularization, the growth and formation of capillary blood vessels, is an essential component of solid tumor growth and a critical step in metastasis. Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) have several functions related to tumor biology including growth, proliferative rate, stroma formation and dissolution, and neovascularization. The aim of this study was to define the TAM and microvessel density (MD) in human invasive breast carcinoma NOS and to correlate their values with lymph node status, tumor size, tumor grade and mitotic activity index (MAI), and, finally, to determine whether MD is connected with TAMs. A total number of 57 invasive breast carcinomas NOS were processed for immunohistochemical analysis using mAb to F-VIII to visualize endothelial cells and mAb to CD68 antigens for macrophages. Statistical analysis showed only a positive correlation between TAMs and MAI (p = 0.004). These results support the notion that intensity of tumor angiogenesis does not provide additional prognostic significance, while TAMs may play a positive role in breast cancer micro system since they regulate tumor proliferation."

Causal attributions were assessed with an open-ended response item, which asked patients to list what they thought were the three most important causal factors of their illness. The relationships between patient characteristics and causal attributions were determined through univariate analysis, and the relationships between causal attributions were obtained using social network analysis. A total of 299 participants provided 707 responses. Stress, diet, and exercise were believed to be the three most likely causes of breast cancer. There were no significant differences between causal attributions and the age, education level, marital status, or cancer stage of patients. However, there were differences in the associations between personality, genetics, and reproductive history and patient-identified causal attributions according to the patients' family history of cancer. Patients with a family history of cancer were more likely to believe that personality and genetics/family history were causes of breast cancer compared to patients without such a history. Therefore, it is necessary to educate patients to perceive stress and lifestyle-related factors as modifiable causal factors in order to have a positive effect on their adherence to AET."

Thus, it is significant to find effective biomarkers for BRCA diagnosis and treatment. Although some members of armadillo (ARM) repeat family of proteins are confirmed to be biomarkers in cancers, the role of armadillo repeat-containing 1 (ARMC1) in BRCA remains unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We firstly analyzed the ARMC1 expression in normal breast tissues and BRCA samples and its association with overall survival by the public database. Next, the χ 2 test was used to evaluate the prognostic significance of ARMC1 expression in TCGA-BRCA patient samples. The ARMC1 mutations in BRCA were explored in the cBioportal database. Besides, the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were used to explore the biological functions of ARMC1 in BRCA. Finally, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining were performed to validate the ARMC1 expression in BRCA.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      ARMC1 expression in tumor samples was significantly higher than that in normal tissues, and higher expression of ARMC1 was related to lower survival. Moreover, the tumor stage and histology of BRCA patients were associated with ARMC1 expression. ARMC1 genetic mutations occurred in 32% of BRCA patients, and the amplification and high expression of ARMC1 accounted for most of them. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis suggested that ARMC1 might be involved in the cell cycle in BRCA. Ultimately, increased ARMC1 expression was found in clinical breast carcinoma tissues by our confirmatory experiments.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      ARMC1 may play a significant role in BRCA and act as a biomarker, which provides valuable clues for the treatment and diagnosis of BRCA."

            "abstract": "Breast cancer is the principal cause of death from cancer in women. Molecular studies of breast cancer, based in the identification of the molecular profiling techniques through cDNA microarray, had allowed defining at least five distinct sub-group: luminal A, luminal B, HER-2-overexpression, basal and 'normal' type breast-like. The technique of tissue microarrays (TMA), described for the first time in 1998, allows to study, in some samples of breast cancer, distinguished by differences in their gene expression patterns, which provide a distinctive molecular portrait for each tumor and the basis for and improved breast cancer molecular taxonomy. Another important implication is that genetic profiling may lead to the identification of new target for therapy and better predictive markers are needed to guide difficult treatment decisions. Additionally, the current pathology classification system is suboptimal, since patients with identical tumor types and stage of disease present different responses to therapy and different overall outcomes. Basal breast tumor represents one of the most intriguing subtypes and is frequently associated with poor prognosis and absence of putative therapeutic targets. Then, the purpose of this review was to resume the most recent knowledge about the breast carcinoma classification and characterization."

Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire and from medical records.

Sixty-eight (32%) patients showed p21 overexpression (>10% of reactive tumor cells). p21 overexpression was associated with large tumor size, positive nodal status, high histological grade, and high mitotic count and was related to short disease-free survival (DFS) in the whole series of patients (P = 0.04), in the node-negative subgroup (P = 0.004), and in the group of patients who did not undergo systemic adjuvant therapy (P = 0.003). In patients treated with systemic adjuvant therapy, bivariate analysis of the combined p21 and p53 phenotypes showed that p21+/p53+ tumors were associated with long DFS and overall survival (OS), whereas p21-/p53+ tumors had the worst prognosis. In treated patients, multivariate analysis showed that the p21-/53+ phenotype was independently associated with short DFS and OS. Our present data support the hypothesis that p21/p53 heterogeneous expression may be of clinical relevance for the therapeutic response to chemotherapy/hormonotherapy. The p21-/p53+ phenotype could correspond to a situation where p53 overexpression really reflects complete abrogation of p53 function.

Currently, however, only oophorectomy is employed as the initial treatment of choice in patients with recurrent breast carcinoma, and its use is exclusively limited to premenopausal or perimenopausal patients whose tumors are estrogen-receptor positive. The decreased utilization of surgical ablative procedures is primarily due to the introduction into clinical practice of two pharmacologic agents, the antiestrogen, tamoxifen, and the adrenal blocking agent, aminoglutethimide. When administered to postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, these pharmacologic agents induce remissions as frequently as do surgical ablative procedures; however, their use is associated with distinctly less morbidity and virtually no mortality."

Ninety patients treated at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy treated from 1968-1981 had a recurrence in the treated breast before (84) or simultaneous with (6) distant metastases. Sixty-five patients had salvage mastectomy (median subsequent follow-up in patients without further disease, 32 months; range, 1-123 months). The five-year rate of further recurrence in this group was 37%. The most important variable associated with subsequent outcome was the histology of the recurrent tumor. There were no further recurrences among 10 patients with purely non-invasive cancer or 10 patients with predominantly non-invasive disease and only focal areas of invasion. In contrast, 17/45 patients (38%) with predominantly infiltrating tumors suffered further local-regional recurrences (6) or distant metastases (11) following mastectomy (5-year actuarial rate, 55%) (p less than 0.05). Ten patients developed regional nodal failures without evidence of simultaneous breast recurrence (1 internal mammary, 3 supraclavicular, 1 both supraclavicular and axillary, and 5 axillary). Only 3 of these 10 (all with axillary node failures) did not have simultaneous distant metastases; they remain alive without evidence of further distant or local-regional recurrence following salvage treatment 1, 59, and 87 months after recurrence. We conclude that the great majority of the patients (88% in this series) who have a breast recurrence following initial conservative surgery and radiation therapy for early stage breast carcinoma will have disease limited to the breast clinically and tumors amenable to salvage mastectomy. Salvage mastectomy appears to be effective treatment for patients with an isolated breast recurrence, especially if the recurrence is predominantly or wholly non-invasive."

Studies published by February 2022 were searched using four databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Elsevier), PsycINFO (EBSCOhost), and Web of Science (Clarivate). All retrieved citations were independently screened and eligibility for inclusion was determined by study team members. Extracted data included research aims, design, sample, type and measures of social relationships (functional and structural), and the association between social relationships and affective-cognitive symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 70 studies were included. Affective symptoms were positively associated with social support, family functioning, quality of relationships, social networks, and social integration, whereas the negative association was found with social constraints.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our findings suggest positive social relationships may mitigate affective symptoms of women with breast cancer. Thus, health care providers need to educate patients about the importance of building solid social relationships and encourage them to participate in a supportive network of friends and family members."

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to analyze the expression and clinical role of 13 signaling molecules in a large cohort of breast carcinoma patients with long follow-up period. Breast carcinomas (n=410) were analyzed for protein expression of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases (p-ERK, p-JNK, p-p38) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway proteins (p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K); the BAG family proteins BAG-1 and BAG-4/SODD; the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2; the inhibitor of apoptosis family member Survivin; and the heat shock protein family members HSP27, HSP70, and HSP90. Protein expression was studied for association with clinicopathological parameters and survival. Significantly higher expression of p-AKT (P<.001), p-mTOR (P<.001), p-p70S6K (P<.001), Bcl-2 (P<.001), BAG-4/SODD (P<.001), HSP27 (P<.001), HSP70 (P=.012), HSP90 (P<.001), and Survivin (P=.004) was found in infiltrating ductal and lobular carcinomas compared to mucinous carcinomas. Bcl-2 expression was significantly higher in grades 1 and 2 compared to grade 3 carcinomas (P<.001). p-AKT expression was higher in tumors more than 2cm (P=.027), whereas p-mTOR expression was lowest in tumors more than 5cm (P=.019). Higher BAG-4/SODD, HSP70, and HSP90 expression was associated with poor overall survival (P=.016, P=.039, and P=.023, respectively) in univariate analysis, whereas the only independent prognosticator in Cox multivariate survival analysis was tumor diameter (P=.003). In conclusion, BAG-4/SODD, HSP70, and HSP90 are potential prognostic markers in node-negative breast carcinoma that merit further research."

            "abstract": "Recent experimental and clinical studies suggest that tumour-induced angiogenesis may be an important step in the evolution of malignant tumours, and may be related to prognosis. In our study we examined 42 cases of breast carcinoma (mean age: 56.76 +/- 13.5), 21 with lymph node metastases and 21 without. Angiogenesis was evaluated after immunohistochemical staining of tumour vessels, using polyclonal antibody to factor VIII related antigen (VIIIR-Ag) and counting of the three most active areas of neovascularization. In the same manner we counted the microvessels in lymph node metastases. The mean vessel count of node-negative cases (51.16 +/- 19.32) did not differ significantly from node-positive cases (45.66 +/- 17.44). In contrast patients younger than 50 years had much higher mean vessel counts (54.04 +/- 16.47) than did patients older than 70 years (38.03 +/- 16.73) producing a P value of < or = 0.05. No association was found between tumour size and mean vessel count, nor was there any significant difference between grade I (45.94 +/- 16.54), grade II (53.13 +/- 23.22) and grade III tumours (51.71 +/- 20.64). When we compared the mean vessel count of primary tumours with those of node metastases, we found much lower counts in the latter (P < or = 0.01). The differences in our results from previous studies, probably reflect the heterogeneity which exists between different tumours in their ability to induce angiogenesis. Additionally, there is some evidence in our study that angiogenesis is possibly related to patient age and probably depends on differences in the tumour stroma."

One of the specific markers of cancer-associated fibroblasts is podoplanin (PDPN) - a mucin-type membrane glycoprotein. The aim of this work was to study the localisation and intensity of expression of Twist and PDPN on the mRNA and protein level in cases of invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDC), and its association with patients' clinico-pathological data.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      The study included archival material in a form of 80 paraffin IDC blocks and 11 IDC fragments frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immunohistochemical expression of Twist and PDPN was evaluated using light microscope and semiquantitative scale for evaluation of nuclear expression or immunoreactive scale (IRS) for evaluation of cytoplasmic expression.

The expression of PDPN was also higher in stromal cells in comparison with cancer cells. In addition, positive correlation was observed between expression of Twist and PDPN in stromal cells of IDC (r=0.267; p<0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The relationship between the higher expression of Twist in both cancer and stromal cells and shorter patients' survival indicates Twist as a potential useful prognostic marker in IDC.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a key mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia and high HIF-1 expression has been identified as a poor prognostic factor in tumours. Recently, we identified the tumour-associated carbonic anhydrases (CA), CA9 and CA12 as hypoxia-inducible in tumour cell lines. Furthermore, we identified CA IX to be a poor prognostic factor in breast cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic significance of CA XII. CA XII expression was studied by immunohistochemistry in a series of 103 cases of invasive breast cancer and any association with recognised prognostic factors or relation with the outcome was examined. CA XII expression was present in 77 out of 103 (75%) cases and was associated with lower grade (P=0.001), positive estrogen receptor status (P<0.001), and negative epidermal growth factor receptor status (P<0.001). Furthermore, although CA XII expression was associated with an absence of necrosis (P<0.001), expression of CA XII in some high-grade tumours was induced in regions directly adjacent to morphological necrosis. Additionally, using univariate analysis, CA XII positive tumours were associated with a lower relapse rate (P=0.04) and a better overall survival (P=0.01). In conclusion, CA XII expression is influenced both by factors related to differentiation and hypoxia in breast cancer in vivo and CA XII expression is associated with a better prognosis in an unselected series of invasive breast carcinoma patients."

To address the question of whether these observations reflect difficulty becoming pregnant or maintaining a pregnancy, we performed additional analyses in which the outcome of each pregnancy was considered. During five years of follow-up, 620 incident cases of breast cancer were identified in the 37,105 women at risk. There was little evidence for an increased risk associated with a history of spontaneous abortion (relative risk [RR] = 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.9-1.4), nor was the risk higher among women who reported two or more spontaneous abortions in consecutive pregnancies (RR = 1.0, CI = 0.7-1.4). Although women who reported that they had tried unsuccessfully to become pregnant had only slightly and nonsignificantly elevated risks of breast cancer (RR = 1.1, CI = 0.9-1.3), a more pronounced and statistically significant association was noted in women with a positive family history (RR = 2.1, CI = 1.4-3.2). There was a strong inverse association between failure to become pregnant and parity (P < 0.0001); nearly 50 percent of the nulliparous married women reported having tried and failed to become pregnant, whereas the frequency was only 6.8 percent among married women with five or more livebirths.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

It was established that breast cancer associated with thyroid pathology (thyroid cancer included) had specific features of the clinical course. Relative risk of breast carcinoma in thyroid cancer patients was not higher than the incidence in female population. Possible etiologic and pathogenic factors of the relationship between thyroid pathology and breast tumors are discussed. It is supposed that hypersecretion of prolactin and gonadotropins might play some role in such association. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy for breast carcinoma also can be predisposing factors to the development of subsequent thyroid pathology."

Women diagnosed with breast cancer after 1987 were defined as tamoxifen exposed; those diagnosed with breast cancer before or during 1987 were defined as not exposed to tamoxifen. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to calculate the risk of subsequent meningioma. Of these women, 223 developed meningioma. For women without tamoxifen exposure, the risk of meningioma was significantly increased, with an SIR of 1.54 (95% confidence interval 1.30-1.81); the risk was not increased in those with tamoxifen exposure (SIR=1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.84-1.32). The increased risk of meningioma in women without tamoxifen exposure persisted during 10 years of follow-up. In this historical cohort study, we found that women diagnosed with breast cancer but not treated with tamoxifen had an increased incidence of meningioma, whereas the incidence was close to that of the general population in patients treated with tamoxifen.

Cytogenetic studies demonstrated that some meningiomas have monosomy of chromosome 22. In addition, human meningiomas are often associated with bilateral acoustic neuroma in which specific loss of alleles on chromosome 22 has been demonstrated. Then, we compared constitutional and tumor genotypes from 14 cases of sporadic human meningiomas, using four polymorphic DNA probes on chromosome 22 (SIS, D22S1, D22S9, IGLC). Loss of constitutional heterozygosity was found in three of 11 informative cases. Two of the three meningiomas maintained constitutional heterozygosity at the IGLC locus and another one showed no loss of heterozygosity at IGLC or D22S9. These results suggest that loss of genes on chromosome 22 caused by either a partial deletion or a mitotic recombination at a locus distal to D22S9 plays an important role in tumorigenesis of the human meningioma."

There is still a lack of consensus regarding certain aspects of managing patients with LCIS.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      - To review recently published literature on LCIS and to provide an overview of the current morphologic classification of LCIS, recent molecular advances, and trends in patient management.\n    \n\n\n          Data sources:\n        \n      \n      - Sources included peer-reviewed, published journal articles in PubMed (US National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland) and published guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (Fort Washington, Pennsylvania).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      - Lobular carcinoma in situ represents a marker for increased risk of breast cancer, as well as a nonobligate precursor to invasive carcinoma. Morphologic variants of LCIS-florid and pleomorphic LCIS-are genetically more-complex lesions and are more likely to be associated with invasive carcinoma. Further investigation into which molecular alterations in LCIS are associated with progression to invasive carcinoma is needed to help guide medical and surgical management."

            "abstract": "Glutathione S-transferase Theta1 and Mu1 (GSTT1 and GSTM1) are involved in the metabolism and detoxification of a wide range of potential environmental carcinogens. Conversely, they contribute to tumour cell survival by detoxification of numerous products induced by cancer therapy. The authors designed a large study to investigate the susceptibility and prognostic implications of the GSTT1 and GSTM1 gene deletions in breast carcinoma. The authors used the polymerase chain reaction to characterise the variation of the GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes in 309 unrelated Tunisian patients with breast carcinoma and 242 healthy control subjects. Associations of the clinic-pathologic parameters and the genetic markers with the rates of the breast carcinoma specific overall survival (OVS) and the disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. A significant association was found between gene deletion of GSTT1 and the risk of early onset of breast carcinoma (OR=1.60, P=0.02). The lack of GSTT1 gene deletion was significantly associated with poor clinical response to chemotherapy (OR=2.29, P=0.03). This association was significantly higher in patients with axillary's lymph node-negative breast carcinoma (OR=12.60, P=0.005). The null-GSTT1 genotype showed a significant association with increased DFS in this selected population of patients. This association was even higher in patients carrying both null-GSTT1 and -GSTM1 genotypes. The gene deletion of GSTs may predict not only the early onset of breast carcinoma but also the clinical response to chemotherapy and the recurrence-free survival for patients with lymph node-negative breast carcinoma."

Valid imaging targets for molecular imaging tracer development are membrane-bound hypoxia-related proteins, expressed when tumor growth outpaces neo-angiogenesis. We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of such hypoxia marker expression rates in human breast cancer to evaluate their potential as clinically relevant molecular imaging targets.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles describing membrane-bound proteins that are related to hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), the key regulator of the hypoxia response. We extracted expression rates of carbonic anhydrase-IX (CAIX), glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1), C-X-C chemokine receptor type-4 (CXCR4), or insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) in human breast disease, evaluated by immunohistochemistry. We pooled study results using random-effects models and applied meta-regression to identify associations with clinicopathological variables.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 1,705 identified articles, 117 matched our selection criteria, totaling 30,216 immunohistochemistry results. We found substantial between-study variability in expression rates. Invasive cancer showed pooled expression rates of 35% for CAIX (95% confidence interval (CI): 26-46%), 51% for GLUT1 (CI: 40-61%), 46% for CXCR4 (CI: 33-59%), and 46% for IGF1R (CI: 35-70%). Expression rates increased with tumor grade for GLUT1, CAIX, and CXCR4 (all p < 0.001), but decreased for IGF1R (p < 0.001). GLUT1 showed the highest expression rate in grade III cancers with 58% (45-69%). CXCR4 showed the highest expression rate in small T1 tumors with 48% (CI: 28-69%), but associations with size were only significant for CAIX (p < 0.001; positive association) and IGF1R (p = 0.047; negative association). Although based on few studies, CAIX, GLUT1, and CXCR4 showed profound lower expression rates in normal breast tissue and benign breast disease (p < 0.001), and high rates in carcinoma in situ. Invasive lobular carcinoma consistently showed lower expression rates (p < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our results support the potential of hypoxia-related markers as breast cancer molecular imaging targets.

Using this technique, serum samples from 107 healthy controls and 62 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were profiled. The most statistically significant alterations were observed in cancer patients compared with healthy controls: an increase in sialylation, branching, and outer-arm fucosylation and a decrease in high-mannosylated and biantennary core-fucosylated glycans. In the controls and cases combined systemic features were analyzed; serum estradiol was associated with increase in digalactosylated glycans, and higher mammographic density was associated with increase in biantennary digalactosylated glycans and with decrease in trisialylated and in outer-arm fucosylated glycans. Furthermore, particular glycans were altered in some features of the breast carcinomas; bisected biantennary nonfucosylated glycans were decreased in patients with progesterone receptor positive tumors, and core-fucosylated biantennary bisected monogalactosylated glycans were decreased in patients with the TP53 mutation. Systemic features show more significant associations with the serum N-glycome than do the features of the breast carcinomas. In conclusion, the UPLC-based glycan analysis technique described here reveals highly significant differences between healthy women and breast cancer patients. Significant associations with breast carcinoma and systemic features are described."

Compared with invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified, with similar histologic grades, carcinomas with IMPC were larger sized, had a higher lymph node metastasis rate with more nodes involved per case, and exhibited increased lymphovascular invasion. The presence of IMPC strongly correlated with the more aggressive behavior. No significant association was established between the proportion of the IMPC component and overall tumor size, histologic grade, lymph node metastasis rate, and distant metastasis, but a trend was noted. Long-term follow-up demonstrated a poorer 5-year and 10-year survival rate for patients with breast carcinoma containing an IMPC component. Breast carcinomas with micropapillary features are more aggressive tumors with a poorer prognosis. This specific structure should be carefully evaluated in the surgical pathology examination of breast carcinoma specimens."

Abnormalities for one or both probes were detected in 83/95 samples. Relative 1p36 under-representation was found in 79/95. The clinical relevance of these alterations was studied by comparing the FISH results with several parameters currently used in breast-cancer pathology. Distinct patterns of chromosome 1 abnormalities were found among the histologic types of breast carcinoma.

We have studied the expression of HA and CD44 in a material of 278 breast cancer cases, half of which were HER2-positive. Intense stromal HA staining was associated with HER2 positivity, large tumor size, lymph node positivity, hormone receptor negativity, poor differentiation, a high body mass index, increased relapse rate and shortened overall survival. Among the 139 HER2-positive cases, the relapse rate was associated with the intensity of stromal HA staining as most of the relapses occurred in the cases with intense stromal HA staining. The presence of HA in the carcinoma cells was related to the frequency of relapses as none of the patients without HA in carcinoma cells experienced a relapse, whereas 33.3% of those with a high percentage of HA-positive carcinoma cells suffered a relapse. CD44 positivity in carcinoma cells was related to poor differentiation, postmenopausal status and triple negative breast carcinoma. CD44 positivity in stromal cells was associated with HER2 positivity, large tumor size, hormone receptor negativity, poor differentiation, increased relapse rate and shortened overall survival. The association between HER2 positivity and intense stromal HA staining indicates that HA could be one of the factors involved in the unfavorable outcome of HER2-positive patients.

It revealed that high CD3D expression was strongly associated with poor survival of BRCA, based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and online websites. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that the high CD3D expression group was mainly enriched for the immune-related pathways and the low CD3D expression group was mainly enriched for metabolic-related activities. Based on CIBERSORT analysis, the difference test and correlation test suggested that CD3D had a strong correlation with T cells, particularly CD8 + T cells, which indicated that CD3D up-regulation may increase T cell immune infiltration in the TME and induce antitumor immunity by activating T lymphocytes. Furthermore, the correlation analysis showed that CD3D expression had a strongly positive correlation with immune checkpoints, which indicating that the underlying mechanism involves CD3D mediated regulation of T cell functions in BRCA, and single cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that CD3D correlate with CD8 + T cells and it is itself highly expressed in CD8 + T cells.

Inflammation is a potential mediator of these associations. To clarify these links for one tumor site, we examined associations between social relationships, circulating inflammation markers, and breast cancer incidence.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Among 132,262 participants from the prospective Women's Health Initiative, we used linear and logistic regression to evaluate associations between social relationship characteristics (social support, social strain, social network size) and inflammation markers of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Cox regression was used to evaluate associations between inflammation markers and breast cancer incidence, as well as associations between social relationship characteristics and breast cancer incidence with and without adjustment for inflammation markers.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Larger social networks were associated with lower continuous CRP (beta = -0.22, 95% CI -0.36, -0.08) and WBC (beta = -0.23, 95% CI -0.31, -0.16). Greater social strain was associated with higher continuous CRP (beta = 0.24, 95% CI 0.14, 0.33) and WBC (beta = 0.09, 95% CI 0.04, 0.14). When WBC was dichotomized at 10,000 cells/uL, high WBC was associated with greater hazards of in situ breast cancer (HR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.17, 2.33) but not invasive breast cancer. Social relationship characteristics were not associated with incidence of invasive or in situ breast cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Larger social networks were associated with lower inflammation and greater social strain was associated with higher inflammation. Higher inflammation might be associated with development of in situ breast cancer, but this appeared to be due to factors other than social relationships."

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      An estimated 10-40 % of breast cancer (BC) patients report negative changes to their partnered relationships. Literature suggests that for these patients, marital satisfaction is related to depression and other quality of life factors which are associated with survivorship and treatment response. However, existing literature does not provide a clear explanation of the factors that strengthen vs. create strain in couples facing cancer. Given the benefits of a satisfying relationship to patient quality of life, it is important to better understand factors that put patients at greater risk for marital difficulties. This study examined the differential and combined roles of hope and optimism among BC patients and their partners on patient marital satisfaction.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Fifty-six breast cancer patient-partner dyads completed study questionnaires as part of a larger study.

These results are divergent from the literature on optimism and well-being, which shows the importance of studying these two traits concurrently. Interaction effects suggest certain combinations of patient and partner hope and optimism are more beneficial than others for patient marital satisfaction and suggest a dyadic approach is important for investigation of well-being in breast cancer."

            "abstract": "The morphological interpretation of histologic sections forms the basis of diagnosis and prognostication for cancer. In the diagnosis of carcinomas, pathologists perform a semiquantitative analysis of a small set of morphological features to determine the cancer's histologic grade. Physicians use histologic grade to inform their assessment of a carcinoma's aggressiveness and a patient's prognosis. Nevertheless, the determination of grade in breast cancer examines only a small set of morphological features of breast cancer epithelial cells, which has been largely unchanged since the 1920s. A comprehensive analysis of automatically quantitated morphological features could identify characteristics of prognostic relevance and provide an accurate and reproducible means for assessing prognosis from microscopic image data. We developed the C-Path (Computational Pathologist) system to measure a rich quantitative feature set from the breast cancer epithelium and stroma (6642 features), including both standard morphometric descriptors of image objects and higher-level contextual, relational, and global image features. These measurements were used to construct a prognostic model. We applied the C-Path system to microscopic images from two independent cohorts of breast cancer patients [from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) cohort, n = 248, and the Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) cohort, n = 328]. The prognostic model score generated by our system was strongly associated with overall survival in both the NKI and the VGH cohorts (both log-rank P ≤ 0.001). This association was independent of clinical, pathological, and molecular factors. Three stromal features were significantly associated with survival, and this association was stronger than the association of survival with epithelial characteristics in the model. These findings implicate stromal morphologic structure as a previously unrecognized prognostic determinant for breast cancer."

The ecologic approach generally finds that dietary fat is highly associated with breast carcinoma mortality, with fish intake and solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation, a source of vitamin D, inversely associated. Case-control and cohort studies generally find a variety of chemical, nonfat dietary, environmental, genetic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors to be important.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An ecologic study was conducted using breast carcinoma mortality rates (1989-1996), dietary supply data, and latitude (an index of solar UV-B radiation) from 35 countries.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The fraction of energy derived from animal products (risk) combined with that from vegetable products (risk reduction), followed by solar UV-B radiation and, to a lesser extent, energy derived from alcohol (risk) and fish intake (risk reduction), were found to explain 80% of the variance of breast carcinoma mortality rates. Dietary fat contributed insignificantly in regressions involving the other factors.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      It is hypothesized that animal products are associated with risk for breast carcinoma because they are associated with greater amounts of insulin-like growth factor-1 and lifetime doses of estrogen. Vegetable products contain several risk reduction components including antioxidants and phytoestrogens. The association with latitude is very likely because of solar UV-B radiation and vitamin D. Alcohol modulates estrogen's effects on breasts. Fish intake is associated with risk reduction through vitamin D and n-3 oils.

Thirty-four couple dyads participated in this eight-month follow-up study. The breast cancer survivors and their spouses completed the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep scale, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised scale and the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and they collected salivary cortisol at home at the time of awakening, 30 and 45 min after waking and at 1200 h, 1700 h and 2100 h. Diurnal cortisol slopes of survivors and spouses are positively correlated. But the factors associated with diurnal cortisol patterns are different between survivors and spouses. For survivors, neither survivor individuals' nor spouses' psychosocial factors were the predictors of survivors' diurnal cortisol patterns. For spouses, the survivors' higher anxious attachment style was the main predictor of spouses' flatter diurnal cortisol patterns. In conclusion, for spouses, psychophysiological stress responses are mainly influenced by breast cancer survivors' insecure attachment. Future couple supportive care interventions can address survivors' attachment styles in close relationships in order to improve neuroendocrine functions for both breast cancer survivors and their spouses."

            "abstract": "Up to 40% of patients undergoing breast conserving surgery for breast cancer require repeat surgeries due to close to or positive margins. The lengthy processing required for evaluating surgical margins by standard paraffin-embedded histology precludes its use during surgery and therefore, technologies for rapid evaluation of surgical pathology could improve the treatment of breast cancer by reducing the number of surgeries required. We demonstrate real-time histological evaluation of breast cancer surgical specimens by staining specimens with acridine orange (AO) and sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) analogously to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and then imaging the specimens with fluorescence nonlinear microscopy (NLM) using a compact femtosecond fiber laser. A video-rate computational light absorption model was used to produce realistic virtual H&E images of tissue in real time and in three dimensions. NLM imaging could be performed to depths of 100 μm below the tissue surface, which is important since many surgical specimens require subsurface evaluation due to contamination artifacts on the tissue surface from electrocautery, surgical ink, or debris from specimen handling. We validate this method by expert review of NLM images compared to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) H&E histology. Diagnostically important features such as normal terminal ductal lobular units, fibrous and adipose stromal parenchyma, inflammation, invasive carcinoma, and in situ lobular and ductal carcinoma were present in NLM images associated with pathologies identified on standard FFPE H&E histology. We demonstrate that AO and SR101 were extracted to undetectable levels after FFPE processing and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) HER2 amplification status was unaffected by the NLM imaging protocol. This method potentially enables cost-effective, real-time histological guidance of surgical resections."

The features commonly seen with CIS were the lobular configuration at low magnification (94%), uninvolved SA in neighboring tissue (84%), at least focally identifiable myoepithelial cells on H&E-stained sections (76%), separate foci of unequivocal CIS (58%), associated microcalcifications (54%), and hyaline basement membrane surrounding tumor cell nests (48%). The group of DCIS with high nuclear grade showed a tendency to occupy the entire lobule of SA, whereas those with non-high grade were more often partially involving the affected lobule. The presence of adjacent separate foci of CIS was more closely related to the DCIS lesions when compared to those of LCIS. The finding of an SA lobule entirely involved by CIS was signifi-cantly correlated with the presence of an invasive carcinoma; this should thus strongly prompt the pathologist to search for other evidence of invasion. Awareness of these features is an additional, useful tool for reaching a proper diagnosis."

The staining was scored (histoscore) by estimates of relative nuclear staining intensity and the percentage of positively stained carcinoma cells. Of the invasive ductal carcinomas 72% were ER-positive and 55% were PR-positive. The invasive lobular, intraductal, tubular, and mucinous carcinomas were the most frequent ER-positive tumor types, whereas comedo and medullary carcinomas only rarely contained ER. Progesterone receptor was most frequently present in intraductal, tubular, and mucinous carcinomas. Better differentiated tumors with lower histologic grade were significantly associated with high prevalence of immunohistochemically determined ER and PR (P less than 0.0001). Proliferative cell fraction, determined by DNA flow cytometric study (n = 63), was inversely related to ER (P = 0.03) and PR (P = 0.05) status. Aneuploidy was independent of ER or PR content."

            "abstract": "Breast carcinoma is the most frequent tumor in the female population. Many factors can influence the risk of breast cancer; some of them, such as old age and breast cancer 1/2 (BRCA1/BRCA2) gene mutations, are associated with a fourfold increase in risk. A previous diagnosis of atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia or having a first-degree relative with a carcinoma are factors associated with a two- to fourfold increase in risk. A relative risk between 1 and 2 is associated with longer exposure to endogenous hormones as a result of early menarche, late menopause and obesity, or with recent and prolonged use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or with behavioural factors such as high alcohol and fat intake. Is it possible to modify breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women? Risk factors related to lifestyle can be changed, even if it is not clear whether modifying these behavioural factors during the postmenopausal period will influence the overall breast cancer risk. For instance, the influence of exogenous hormones throughout life (both oral contraceptives and HRT) should be evaluated according to the individual risk-benefit ratio. The problem is even more complex for women who carry genetic mutations and for those who have close relatives with breast cancer, who may be candidates for risk reduction strategies. Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy is still controversial, but is frequently offered to or requested by this group of women and may be indicated in BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers. Chemoprevention with tamoxifen and with the new selective estrogen receptor modulators, namely raloxifene, is very promising and deserves a thorough discussion for all high-risk women."

This study is a prospective validation of our prior results. Consecutive cases of invasive breast carcinoma (n=2742) were reviewed to determine the diagnoses, including histologic type, grade, presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and extent of RC. No differences were found in the extent of RC between corresponding core needle biopsy and surgical samples. Extent of RC showed a significant correlation with tumor size, grade, LVI, and nodal metastasis in both core needle biopsy and surgical specimens. These associations remained significant in subset analyses of small (≤1 cm), node-negative and node-positive tumors. Extensive RC predicted poor recurrence-free (P<0.0001) and overall (P<0.0001) survival and remained significant in subset analyses of node-negative (P=0.0015 and 0.0021, respectively) and node-positive (P=0.0039 and 0.0214, respectively) cases. Carcinomas without LVI but extensive RC were associated with better outcome than carcinomas with LVI but worse than those without LVI and low RC. This prospective study confirms that the presence of extensive RC in invasive breast carcinomas correlates with aggressive tumor features and lymphatic tumor spread. Extensive RC appears to be an independent factor predictive of poor outcome in node-negative and node-positive disease. Our results support the hypothesis that RCs are the morphologic reflection of biological changes in tumor cells playing a role in lymphatic tumor spread and likely represent an early stage of LVI with similar clinical implications."

We performed whole-exome sequencing of the hyperplastic epithelial component of three JPs, including one with coexisting ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type (IDC-NST). JPs harbored clonal somatic PIK3CA hotspot mutations in two cases. In the JP with coexisting DCIS and IDC-NST, these lesions were clonally related to the associated JP, sharing a clonal PIK3CA E542K somatic hotspot mutation. JP showed a paucity of copy number alterations, whereas the associated DCIS and IDC-NST showed concurrent 1q gains/16q losses, hallmarks of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers. We observed JP to harbor a dominant aging-related mutational signature, whereas coexisting DCIS and IDC-NST showed greater exposure to an APOBEC signature.

There were highly significant linear correlations (P less than 0.001) between the concentrations of ER (expressed as log10) in primary and secondary specimens in all groups. The relationship between PgR concentrations in primary and secondary specimens in groups 1 and 2 was highly significant, although there appeared to be a greater tendency for loss of PgR in sequential, than in simultaneous secondary biopsies. When expressed in terms of hormone receptor status (HRS), the same rate of discordance was observed in groups 1 and 2 (30% when concentrations were expressed in terms of cytosol protein). In group 1 the major cause of discordance was the occurrence of receptor +ve secondaries in association with receptor -ve primaries, possibly because of the high cellularity of many involved axillary nodes. In group 2, the major cause of discordance was the occurrence of receptor -ve secondaries derived from receptor +ve primaries. In both groups discordance in PgR status was more frequent than in ER status. In group 3, overall discordance in HRS was 24% and was due equally to ER and PgR; however, the high concordance rate for PgR was probably due to the fact that the tumours were initially PgR -ve, and the secondaries were also -ve. These results confirm that ER content tends to be stable, even after long periods of time and the administration of chemotherapy and/or irradiation. Progesterone receptor content is much less stable, and may decrease during quite short time intervals even in the absence of treatment."

This study utilized a theoretical framework based on the family systems perspective to understand intrafamilial cancer risk communication patterns in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Individuals (n = 120) at an elevated risk for BRCA1/2 mutations were included. Change in communication patterns over time was assessed using McNemar tests. Associations with communication patterns were assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Overall, the proportion of participants encouraged by others significantly (p < .001) increased from before to after genetic counseling. A higher proportion of participants were encouraged by female family members compared with male family members. Participants who were older, had no personal history of cancer, and had a higher cancer risk perception were more likely to be encouraged by others for genetic testing. Participant's intent to encourage family members for genetic testing from before counseling to after receipt of genetic test results decreased by 16.7%. Participants who had no personal history of cancer and had informative test results for a BRCA1/2 mutation were more likely to encourage other family members for genetic testing. In addition, qualitative findings suggested that closeness among family members, concern for family, especially future generations, and cognizance about cancer risk facilitate information sharing and encouragement for genetic testing. Our findings indicate that intrafamilial cancer risk communication varies with the structure of family relationships and that genetic counseling can play an important role in improving intrafamilial cancer risk communication."

Self-examiners also tended to seek medical care more rapidly and to have earlier stages of disease at diagnosis. Five years after diagnosis, the cumulative observed survival rates from breast cancer were 76.7% among self-examiners and 60.9% among nonexaminers (P less than 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis known sociodemographic and treatment confounders accounted for 25% of the excess of breast cancer deaths among nonexaminers. Approximately half of the remaining survival differential was attributable to the more limited disease among selfexaminers.

P-cadherin expression is restricted to the myoepithelial cells in normal breast tissue, and aberrant staining has also been described in invasive tumors. Several small studies have reported P-cadherin as a marker of poor outcome in breast cancer patients but its prognostic significance in relation to other variables has not been established in a large series of breast cancers. A tissue microarray was constructed from 3992 cases of invasive breast carcinoma, and P-cadherin expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Median follow-up was 12.5 years. The immunohistochemistry-based definitions of cancer subtypes were luminal (ER+ or PR+/HER2-), luminal/HER2+ (ER+ or PR+/HER2+), HER2+ (ER-/PR-/HER2+), and basal (ER-/PR-/HER2-/CK5/6+ or EGFR+). Clinical covariate and biomarker associations were assessed using contingency tables, and Pearson's χ(2) or Fisher's exact test. Survival associations were assessed using Kaplan-Meier plots, logrank and Breslow tests, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. P-cadherin was expressed in 34.8% (1290/3710, 50% cut point) of cases. P-cadherin staining was strongly associated with HER2+ and basal carcinoma subtypes (P<0.0005). P-cadherin-positive patients showed significantly poorer short-term (0-10 years) overall survival, disease-specific survival, distant relapse-free interval, and locoregional relapse-free interval in univariable models (P<0.05). In multivariable Cox models containing standard clinical covariates and cancer subtypes, P-cadherin did not show independent prognostic value. P-cadherin expression was positively associated with histological grade, chemotherapy, Ki-67, EGFR, CK5/6, p53, YB-1, and HER2 expression (P<0.002), and negatively associated with age at diagnosis, ER, PR, and Bcl-2 expression (P<0.0005). This study shows the value of P-cadherin as a marker of poor prognosis. The large sample size of this series clarifies contradictory findings of many smaller studies. P-cadherin positivity is associated with high-grade tumor subtypes and well-established markers of poor prognosis, and may represent a promising antibody therapeutic target."

The literature review yielded 5 studies that analyzed cancer registry data merged with community-level variables (1995-2004).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Community variables constructed for the current study reflected social and economic risk factors, physician supply, and health maintenance organization penetration. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the significant predictors of increasingly progressive BCSAD.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Disparities remained for black and Hispanic females in California, who were least likely to be diagnosed early compared with their white counterparts. Younger (< 40 years) and middle-aged (40-64 years) females were less likely to be diagnosed with early BCSAD, compared with older females (> or = 65 years). Utilizing services at hospitals serving a lower volume of patients with breast carcinoma was associated with later BCSAD. After controlling for individual-level factors, community-level variables constructed at the census block group and county level were tested. If a woman resided in a neighborhood with greater percentages of female-headed households, persons living below the poverty level, less educated people, and more recent immigrants, then her chances of being diagnosed at an earlier stage were diminished. If, conversely, she resided in a neighborhood with greater percentages of females > or = 65 years (a proxy for Medicare coverage), her access to medical care and the probability of earlier BCSAD increased. County-level insurance rates and residing in counties where greater percentages of women ever had a mammogram were associated with in situ and early-stage diagnosis. Similarly, the supply of primary care physicians and radiologists was associated positively with earlier BCSAD.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Results confirmed community-level predictors of socioeconomic and delivery system context matter, although the individual-level predictors showed a stronger effect. Nevertheless, analysis of community variables is promising for guiding and evaluating the effects of health policy and developing community and delivery system interventions for earlier detection and treatment of breast carcinoma."

            "abstract": "Meningiomas are common tumours derived from the thin membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Currently, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the initiation and progression of these tumors are largely unknown. Toward the elucidation of such mechanisms, we have formulated an experimental design utilizing the technique of subtractive hybridization that is aimed at identifying the changes in gene expression between intracranial meningiomas and their normal precursor cells, leptomeningeal cells. We report here the identification and initial characterization of three genes whose expression is altered or aberrant in meningioma cell lines and tumours relative to cultures of normal leptomeningeal cells. Complementary DNA probes from one of these genes detect transcripts of altered size in several meningiomas relative to normal leptomeningeal cells. Another of these genes demonstrates decreased expression in meningiomas and in tumours associated with the disorder neurofibromatosis 2. A third gene isolated by this procedure is differentially expressed in both meningiomas and breast carcinomas. Therefore, the decreased expression of these genes may play roles in growth-regulatory pathways that are abrogated not only in meningiomas, but in other tumor types as well."

Obesity-induced chronic inflammation promoted by adipose tissue dysfunction is a key feature, which is thought to be an important link between obesity and cancer. Oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested to play an important role in carcinogenesis. Obese women have been shown to have higher levels of OS markers.

In the period closer to diagnosis, majority of the women received helpful informational support from health care providers (84.0%); helpful emotional support from family (85%), friends (80.4%), and providers (67.1%); and helpful decision-making support from providers (75.2%) and family (71.0%).

Perceived helpfulness of informational, emotional, and decision-making support provided by family, friends, and providers however significantly decreased over time (p<0.001). Cancer patients' desire significant amount of support throughout their cancer journey. Our results show that while patients receive a lot of support during the period closer to diagnosis, receipt of helpful support drops significantly within the first year itself. In order to facilitate cancer patients' adjustment to their illness, efforts need to be made to understand and address their support needs throughout the cancer experience."

            "abstract": "It is speculated that estrogens play important roles in the male breast carcinoma (MBC) as well as the female breast carcinoma (FBC). However, estrogen concentrations or molecular features of estrogen actions have not been reported in MBC, and biological significance of estrogens remains largely unclear in MBC. Therefore, we examined intratumoral estrogen concentrations, estrogen receptor (ER) α/ERβ status, and expression profiles of estrogen-induced genes in MBC tissues, and compared these with FBC. 17β-Estradiol concentration in MBC (n = 4) was significantly (14-fold) higher than that in non-neoplastic male breast (n = 3) and tended to be higher than that in FBC (n = 7). Results of microarray analysis clearly demonstrated that expression profiles of the two gene lists, which were previously reported as estrogen-induced genes in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line, were markedly different between MBC and FBC. In the immunohistochemistry, MBC tissues were frequently positive for aromatase (63 %) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (67 %), but not for steroid sulfatase (6.7 %). A great majority (77 %) of MBC showed positive for both ERα and ERβ, and its frequency was significantly higher than FBC cases. These results suggest that estradiol is locally produced in MBC tissue by aromatase. Different expression profiles of the estrogen-induced genes may associate with different estrogen functions in MBC from FBC, which may be partly due to their ERα/ERβ status."

We conducted a case-control study including 582 women with breast cancer and 1,569 controls free of breast cancer selected from participants in the Nurses' Health Study and the Nurses' Health Study II. Information concerning childhood diet of the nurses at ages 3-5 years was obtained from the mothers of the participants with a 30-item food-frequency questionnaire. An increased risk of breast cancer was observed among woman who had frequently consumed French fries at preschool age. For one additional serving of French fries per week, the odds ratio (OR) for breast cancer adjusted for adult life breast cancer risk factors was 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12-1.44). Consumption of whole milk was associated with a slightly decreased risk of breast cancer (covariate-adjusted OR for every additional glass of milk per day = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.82-0.99). Intake of none of the nutrients calculated was related to the risk of breast cancer risk in this study. These data suggest a possible association between diet before puberty and the subsequent risk of breast cancer. Differential recall of preschool diet by the mothers of cases and controls has to be considered as a possible explanation for the observed associations. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the association between preschool diet and breast cancer is reproducible in prospective data not subject to recall bias."

Even more, IBC has not been associated with a specific histologic tumor type. With recent epidemiologic and molecular evidence now suggesting that IBC is a distinct disease entity rather than a subtype of locally advanced breast cancer, the accurate differentiation of this disease has never been more crucial to ensuring appropriate treatment.

Archived obstetric records provided the standard measures of maternal pelvic size (intercristal distance, interspinous distance, the intercristal-interspinous difference, and the external conjugate distance).

We also investigated the role of SMAD4 expression status in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in responding to TGF-β stimulation. SMAD4 expression was assessed in 53 breast ductal carcinoma samples and in the surrounding normal tissue from 50 of the samples using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and real-time PCR. TGF-β-SMAD and non-SMAD signaling was assessed by Western blot in MDA-MB-468 cells with and without SMAD4 restoration.

Further, we have demonstrated that SMAD4 has a potential role in the development of breast carcinoma and SMAD4 was a potential prognostic marker of breast carcinoma. Our findings further support the role of SMAD4 in breast carcinoma development. In addition, we observed an inverse relationship between SMAD4 levels and breast carcinoma histological grade. Our finding indicated that SMAD4 expression level in breast cancer cells played a role in responding non-SMAD signaling but not the canonic SMAD signaling. Further mechanistic studies are necessary to establish the role of SMAD4 in breast carcinoma prognosis and potential specific targeting."

            "abstract": "A molecular study was performed on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in a Cypriot family, with a history of both male and female breast cancers. Three variants were detected in the BRCA1 gene, two of which are missense mutations at nucleotide positions 1186 in exon 11 (Q356R), and 4654 in exon 15 (S1512I). The third variant is a polymorphism at position 2430 in exon 11 (771L). Similarly in the BRCA2 gene two variants were detected: a missense mutation at position 1342, exon 10 (H372N), and a polymorphism at position 3624 in exon 11 (1132K). Since these BRCA2 variants appear to be polymorphisms in the Cypriot population, we suggest that the two BRCA1 mutations, Q356R and S1512I, may be related to the breast cancer phenotype."

However, the prognostic significance of the stromal component in breast cancers, particularly those of high grade, has not been established. In this study, we analyzed surgically resected specimens from 545 patients with breast carcinoma, including 193 high-grade tumors, for tumor-stroma ratio, dominant stroma type [collagen (C), fibroblast (F), or lymphocyte (L) dominant type], and central fibrosis on hematoxylin-eosin-stained histological sections. We correlated these features with clinical prognosis. Among the 533 specimens examined, 127 (23.3 %) were of C type, 292 (53.6 %) of F type, and 114 (20.9 %) of L type. Central fibrosis was found in 99 tumors (18 %). The dominant stroma type was a significant prognostic factor on univariate and multivariate analyses, together with T classification, nodal status, and Bloom-Richardson grade. Tumor-stroma ratio and central fibrosis did not predict survival on multivariate analysis. Even in high-grade tumors, relapse-free intervals differed significantly according to dominant stroma type. Thus, conventional hematoxylin-eosin-stained tumor slides may contain more prognostic information than previously thought; in particular, the dominant stroma type in invasive breast cancer may potentially be used to predict outcome."

However, the significance of androgen actions remains largely unclear in breast carcinoma, differing from estrogen actions. Therefore, in this review, we summarized recent studies on androgens in breast carcinoma. Concentration of a potent androgen, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), was significantly higher in breast carcinoma tissue than in plasma, and DHT is considered to be locally produced from circulating androstenedione by 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5 and 5alpha-reductase. On the other hand, aromatase was recently reported as a negative regulator for intratumoral DHT production by possibly reducing the precursor testosterone. Androgens predominantly show antiproliferative effects in breast carcinoma cells, but association between AR status and the clinical outcome of the patient remains controversial, perhaps partly because AR status does not necessarily reflect androgenic action in breast carcinoma. Recently, molecular apocrine breast carcinoma was identified by microarray analysis. Molecular apocrine carcinoma was characterized by being estrogen receptor (ER) negative and AR positive and by being associated with increased androgen signaling and apocrine features. Therefore, androgenic actions may also be involved in apocrine features in breast carcinoma."

The overall positivity of GATA3 across various histological subtypes was 71.43% with no correlation with histological type (p = 0.849). Our study also confirmed that GATA3 exhibits a relatively high sensitivity for IBC (78.57%). GATA3 expression was positively correlated with low histological grades (G1/G2) vs. G3: p = 0.001) with most of G3 (57.89%) cases being negative and with luminal A (72.22%) and B (84.62%) subtypes (p = 0.00001) while most of the triple negative (87.5%) and HER2-overexpressed (66.67%) being negative.

We recently demonstrated estrogen-mediated induction of EGR3 in breast carcinoma cells. However, EGR3 has not yet been examined in breast carcinoma tissues and its significance remains unknown. Therefore, in this study, we examined biological functions of EGR3 in the breast carcinoma by immunohistochemistry, in vitro study, and nude mouse xenograft model. EGR3 immunoreactivity was detected in carcinoma cells in 99 (52%) out of 190 breast carcinoma tissues and was associated with the mRNA level. EGR3 immunoreactivity was positively associated with lymph node status, distant metastasis into other organs, estrogen receptor alpha, or EGR3 immunoreactivity in asynchronous recurrent lesions in the same patients, and was negatively correlated with tubule formation. EGR3 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrence and adverse clinical outcome by both uni- and multivariate analyses. Egr3-expressing transformant cell lines derived from MCF-7 Tet-Off cells (Eg-10 and Eg-11) significantly enhanced the migration and invasion properties according to the treatment of doxycyclin, but did not significantly change the cell proliferation. Moreover, Eg-11 cells injected into athymic mice irregularly invaded into the adjacent peritumoral tissues, although Clt-7, which was stably transfected with empty vector as a control, demonstrated a well-circumscribed tumor. Eg-11 cells were significantly associated with invasive components and less tubule formation in the xenograft model. These results suggest that EGR3 plays an important role in estrogen-meditated invasion and is an independent prognostic factor in breast carcinoma."

This is the most recent of many studies showing an association between a variety of thyroid disorders and breast cancer. Such an association is not surprising as both diseases are female predominant with a similar postmenopausal peak incidence. The significance of the presence of thyroid autoantibodies, particularly thyroid peroxidase antibodies, in serum from patients with breast cancer is unknown, but it has been suggested that antibody positivity is associated with better prognosis. One area in which thyroid and breast functions overlap is in the uptake and utilization of dietary iodide. Experimental findings showing the ability of iodine or iodine-rich seaweed to inhibit breast tumour development is supported by the relatively low rate of breast cancer in Japanese women who consume a diet containing iodine-rich seaweed. However, there is as yet no direct evidence that iodine, iodinated compounds, or a combination of iodine and selenium is the antimammary carcinogenic element in the Japanese diet. It remains to be resolved whether the perceived breast cancer-thyroid disease relationship is thyroid or iodine related or, in the case of thyroid autoantibodies, is the consequence of an immune response to the carcinoma. Is this response breast specific and does it relate to iodine status? These and many other questions await resolution before a definitive role in the natural history of breast carcinoma can be assigned to the thyroid."

A key sociocultural obstacle against breast screening and early detection of BC in several conservative cultures is that men manage women's choices and activities. The aim of this research is to find out the key background knowledge, attitudes, and related practice among male partners in the city of Abha in relation to women's BC prevention and means for early detection. Methods: A cross-sectional study targeting husbands aged 20 years or older chosen from the outpatient clinics in the Urban Primary Health Care Centers in Abha City. Through questionnaires, interview data were collected regarding knowledge about BC and wife practices and attitudes towards BC. Results: The study included 832 husbands. The study showed that only 20.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 19.9-24.1) of husbands had heard about mammography and only 22.1% had heard about breast self-examination among women as a screening test for BC. The most commonly mentioned variations that might occur in relation to BC were size changes (45.6%). The leading source of BC knowledge was from television (48.9%), and the least-mentioned source of information was healthcare workers (22.4%). Husbands mentioned that only 9.3% of wives had been examined before by mammography. In a multivariate logistic regression of male factors associated with wives' practices and attitudes towards BC, only good knowledge among husbands was a significant factor. Conclusions: The study documented the low level of BC knowledge among male partners. There is an urgent need to pay more consideration to disseminating awareness among men, as they are associates, and they must be armed with proper awareness. There is an urgent demand for establishing a national program and educational campaigns towards BC. Stressing the advantages and access to free mammography is necessary."

Much interest has been focused on expression of its members in breast cancer because of their potential role as prognostic indicators and their involvement in cancer therapy. We have examined 1447 cases of invasive breast carcinoma with a long-term follow-up, using tissue microarray (TMA) technology and immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression profiles of several mucins (MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, MUC5AC and MUC6) and to assess their prognostic value. We detected MUC1 expression in 91% of tumours. MUC1 overexpression was associated with a lower grade, smaller tumour size, a higher oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive phenotype and absence of both regional recurrence and distance metastasis. The subcellular localization but not the level of expression had a prognostic value in predicting outcome. The aberrant cytoplasmic and membranous localization of MUC1 was associated with poor outcome compared with apical localization, which is the normal physiological site of expression. MUC2 expression was noticed in only 8.3% of all cases and was restricted to the cytoplasm of the tumour cells. An inverse trend was identified between MUC2 expression and lymph node stage and vascular invasion status. On excluding cases of mucinous carcinoma from the analysis, the inverse association with vascular invasion was still defined and in addition an inverse association with ER status emerged. MUC3 expression was detected in 91% of cases and its expression was associated with increased local recurrence, and lymph node stage. The membranous expression of MUC3 was found to be a potentially poor prognostic feature, with higher grade and poorer Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI), and negative ER expression. MUC4, MUC5AC and MUC6 were expressed in 95, 37 and 20% of cases, respectively. Apart from an association between MUC4 expression and tumour grade and between MUC6 and ER-negative tumours, no other associations with any clinicopathological variables were found. Apart from the higher expression of MUC2 and MUC6 in mucinous carcinomas, no association was found between the expression of different mucins and tumour type. No association between the level of expression of any of the studied mucins and patient outcomes has been identified. In conclusion, most breast carcinomas express MUC1, MUC3 and MUC4. Among the various mucins expressed in breast cancer, MUC1 and MUC3 are potential prognostic indicators, MUC1 having the strongest relationship with patient outcome."

            "abstract": "Lobular neoplasia (LN), invasive lobular breast cancer (ILBC) and related pleomorphic variants represent a distinct group of neoplastic mammary gland lesions. This study assessed the inter-observer agreement of histological grading in a series of ILBC and LN. 54 cases (36x ILBC, 18x LN) were evaluated by 17 observers. 3978 classification calls on various histological features, including nuclear grade, proliferative activity (Ki67 immunohistochemistry, categorical scoring), histological grade and pleomorphism were obtained. Pairwise Cohen's kappa values were calculated and compared between various features and different observer subsets with variable histomorphological experience. In ILBC, pairwise inter-observer agreement for histological grade ranged from poor to almost perfect concordance and was higher in advanced and experienced histopathologists compared with beginners (P < 0.001). Agreement for proliferation (Ki67) ranged from slight to almost perfect concordance and was also higher in advanced and experienced histopathologists (P < 0.001). Considering different features, agreement for proliferation (Ki67) was superior to agreement for histological grade and nuclear grade, even among advanced and experienced histopathologists (P < 0.001). In LN, agreement for B-classification ranged from poor to almost perfect concordance and was higher in advanced and experienced histopathologists (P < 0.001). Considering different features, agreement for proliferation (Ki67 in LN) was superior to subclassification agreement based on conventional features, such as acinar distention and nuclear grade (P < 0.001). In summary, pairwise inter-observer concordance of histological grading of ILBC and LN is dependent on histomorphological experience. Assessment of proliferation by Ki67 immunohistochemistry is associated with favorable inter-observer agreement and can improve histological grading of ILBC as well as LN."

            "abstract": "The MHC class I chain-related gene A (MICA) is frequently expressed on the surface of intestinal epithelium and by many epithelial tumours. MICA is a stress-induced antigen which was identified as an activator of natural killer cells via interaction with the NKG2D receptor. We have raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide that recognises denatured MICA on both Western blots and in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. In the present study this antibody was used to undertake a definitive study of 530 breast cancer cases with mean follow up of 7 years to determine the prognostic significance of MICA expression. To detect any association between MICA expression and NK infiltration, whole sections of 50 tumours were also analysed for CD56 staining. Univariate analysis showed significant relationships between MICA expression and histological grade (P = 0.006), lymph node stage (P = 0.013), Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI, P = 0.002), the presence of vascular invasion (P = 0.045) and tumour type (P = 0.023). Upregulation of MICA was more often found in histological grade 3, poor prognosis (NPI >5.4) tumours. Association of high MICA expression with NK cell infiltration was not demonstrated, as very few NK cells were present in whole breast sections. Our results suggest that induced expression of MICA may be an indicator of poor prognosis in breast carcinoma and is indicative of a tumour environment that has undergone stresses such as apoptosis, necrosis, or hypoxia."

            "abstract": "A series of 211 female breast carcinomas was studied with special reference to the relationships between estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor status and the reactions of the axillary lymph nodes as manifestations of tumor-host reactivity. Carcinomas were classified according to their nuclear grade (NG), and the following nodal reactions were recorded: extent of cancer metastasis, paracortical activity (PCA), follicular hyperplasia (LFH), sinus histiocytosis (SH), and degenerative sinus histiocytosis (DSH). NG did not directly correlate with ER- or PR-positivity, albeit the highest frequency of both was found in well differentiated carcinomas. ER- and less significantly PR-values were higher in post- than in premenopausal females. ER- and PR-positivity as well as the absolute receptor values were lowest in the cases with extensive (Grade 4) nodal metastases, but did not show a direct relationship to the other grades (0 to 3). PCA did not show any relation to the receptor status, whereas LFH seemed to bear an inverse relationship with ER- (but not PR-) positivity. SH seemed to be associated with higher frequency of ER-positivity than did DSH-nodes, the differences being slight, however. It is concluded that hormone receptor assays connected with the morphological assessment of tumor-host reactivity provide some benefit in grouping the breast cancer patients according to the different expectancy of the outcome of their disease."

The aim of this study was to examine the expression of androgen receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and correlate it using immunochemistry with the nuclear localization of androgen receptor in a large number of meningiomas. Thirty-nine meningiomas were examined by Northern blot analysis for the presence of measurable amounts of androgen receptor mRNA and eight of these were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for receptor protein. Sixty-seven percent of the meningiomas expressed androgen receptor mRNA. There was a marked predominance of women among the patients whose tumors expressed androgen receptor; 69% were women and 31% were men. The immunohistochemical data correlated with Northern blot analysis of mRNA. The staining was predominantly nuclear, suggesting that the androgen receptor resides in a location that can activate gene expression."

The alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) family is associated with alcohol metabolism in vivo. However, whether ADHs can act as biomarkers for BC and the underlying mechanism of them affecting BC are unclear. In the present study, the expression levels, prognostic values, epigenetic and genetic alterations, and regulatory networks of ADHs were explored in BC using public online database. Among ADHs family, the expression level of ADH2 is remarkably decreased in the BC and high expression level of ADH2 is significantly associated with better overall survival in BC. Decreasing mRNA expression level of ADH2 is due to DNA hypermethylation in the promoter rather than genetic alterations. ADH2 strongly correlates with pathways in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, and cytochrome P450 pathways in BC. Our finding provided novel insights into ADH2 in BC and implied that ADH2 could act as a novel biomarker for BC prognosis."

The aim of our study was to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of a panel of 12 serum biochemical markers reflecting biological pathways underlying BM development. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated 29 patients with primary breast carcinoma without BM (BC/BM-), 28 patients with breast carcinoma and BM (BC/BM+) and 15 healthy women. In longitudinal analyses, we investigated 34 patients for whom serum was obtained a two different time points: at the time of primary BC diagnosis and after a median time of 3 years. During this follow-up, 15 patients developed BM, whereas the other 19 remained free of BM. In patients who developed BM, the second samples were obtained before BM was documented by bone scan. The cross-sectional analyses have shown all biochemical markers to be significantly elevated in patients with BM, when compared to the patients without BM and healthy controls, except TGFbeta1 that was significantly decreased. Multivariable analyses showed that only the bone resorption markers TRACP 5b, CTX and ICTP, and the marker of angiogenesis VEGF were independently associated with BM. Those markers correctly distinguished 85% of BC patients with or without BM from normal individuals. Longitudinal analyses showed that patients with primary BC who developed BM during follow-up had higher levels of TRACP5b (+95%, P=0.08) at the time of primary diagnosis, those patients had also a higher increases of ICTP (P=0.006), MMP-7 (P=0.004) and TIMP-1 (P=0.017) during follow-up than patients who did not progress toward bone metastasis. This study provides evidence of increase and interrelationship of circulating markers of angiogenesis, invasion and bone resorption in patients with BC with and without BM.

The key outcome was intention to tell test results to adult first-degree relatives. The theory predicts that global and specific attitudes, global and specific perceived social norms, and perceived control will influence the communication of genetic test results. A logistic regression model revealed that global attitude (p < .05), specific social influence (p < .01), and perceived control (p < .05) were significant predictors of intention to tell. When gender and generation of relatives were added to the regression, participants were more likely to convey genetic test results to female than to male relatives (p < .05) and were also more likely to communicate test results to children (p < .01) or siblings (p < .05) than to parents. However, this association depended on knowing the relative's opinion of genetic testing. Intention to tell was lowest among participants who did not know their relative's opinion.

A comparison of recurrence was made of patients whose tumor cells exhibited LEA.135 expression (24 +/- 8% recurring by 7 years), compared with those patients whose specimens showed the absence of LEA.135 expression (41 +/- 10% recurring by 7 years). A statistically significant univariant association between LEA.135 expression and the absence of recurrence of DCIS or development of locally invasive breast carcinoma was observed, suggesting a favorable prognostic significance of LEA. 135 expression (log-rank p = 0.032). It is worthy of mention that none of the LEA. 135-positive patients developed recurrence as DCIS or locally invasive breast carcinoma (0.24 +/- 0.08) after 5 years of the initial diagnosis of DCIS, whereas those from LEA. 135-negative progressively increased their recurrence at 5 years (0.30 +/- 0.09), 7 years (0.41 +/- 0.10) and 10 years (0.63 +/- 0.12).

Communication of this information and related decision-making could be important factors influencing breast cancer risk reduction and early detection behaviors. Using survey data from 2328 women (mean age 62.5 years) from 372 families enrolled in the Minnesota breast cancer family study, we explored adult daughter's reports of breast cancer risk reduction advice received from their mothers.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      Approximately 212 (9%) of respondents reported receiving breast cancer risk reduction advice from their mothers and 130 (89%) reported acting upon such advice. Having a mother or first degree relative (FDR) with a history of breast cancer was significantly correlated with following advice to a higher degree as compared with those not having such family history (p=0.003). Most frequently reported types of advice were to have mammograms (36%) and to have clinical breast exams (35%). Using multivariable logistic regression and after accounting for non-independence of the sample, significant independent correlates of receiving advice included younger age, having an affected mother, and having a higher perceived breast cancer risk. Receiving advice was also correlated with engaging in a higher number of health promoting behaviors and ever having received a mammogram.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our preliminary findings are consistent with social influence theory and suggest that mother-daughter communication about reducing risk, especially among those having a FDR with breast cancer, could be a potential pathway through which breast cancer family history is associated with the adoption of breast cancer screening and risk reduction behaviors."

However, its details have remained largely unknown in breast cancer patients. Therefore, in this study, we focused on perilipin 2, which is involved in constituting the intracellular lipid composition. Perilipin 2 was first immunolocalized in 105 cases of breast cancer. The status of perilipin 2 immunoreactivity was significantly positively associated with histological grade, Ki-67 labeling index and HER2 status and negatively with estrogen receptor status of these patients. Subsequent in vitro study also revealed that its mRNA expression in triple negative breast carcinoma cells was higher than cells of other subtypes. We then examined the correlation between perilipin 2 immunoreactivity and intracellular lipid droplet evaluated by Oil-red O stating in 13 cases of breast carcinoma tissues. A significantly positive correlation was detected between the status of perilipin 2 and Oil-red O staining. These findings above did indicate that perilipin 2 could represent the status of intracellular lipid droplets in surgical pathology specimens of breast cancer and perilipin 2 was also associated with its more aggressive biological phenotypes."

Involvement of the contralateral axilla is a manifestation of systemic disease (stage IV) or a regional metastasis from a new occult primary (T0N1, stage II). The uncertain laterality of the cancer responsible for these metastases complicates overall disease staging and is a management dilemma for clinicians. Seven women who developed contralateral axillary metastases (CAM), but did not have evidence of systemic disease were identified. Patient demographics, histopathologic tumor characteristics, treatment and outcome were examined. The median age was 49 years. A family history of breast cancer was present in six (86%). The initial breast cancers were located in all quadrants. They were generally hormone receptor negative, HER-2/neu overexpressing and associated with lymphovascular invasion. There was a median interval of 71 months between initial breast cancer diagnosis and CAM presentation. Surgical management of the CAM included simple excision in one (14%) and axillary lymph node dissection in five (71%). Adjuvant treatment consisted of chemotherapy in seven (100%) and hormonal therapy in one (14%). The median follow-up from the diagnosis of CAM was 35 months and three women were alive without disease, two were alive with disease and two had died of disease. With surgical treatment, there were no axillary recurrences in this series. When patients present with CAM and no evidence of systemic disease or a new primary in the contralateral breast, surgical treatment should be considered for local control and possibly improved relapse-free survival."

MiR-200c is a member of the miR-200 family; it is known to be dysregulated in invasive breast carcinoma. MiR-200c maintains the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and inhibits cell migration and invasion. Recent studies showed that miR-200c regulated steroid hormone receptors, estrogen receptors (ER), and progesterone receptors (PR). The present study aimed to detect miR-200c in 172 invasive breast carcinoma cases selected from a prospective cohort enrolled in Kuopio, Eastern Finland, between 1990 and 1995. MiR-200c expression was determined with relative q-PCR, and results were compared to clinicopathological variables and patient outcome. We found that PR status combined with miR-200c expression was a significant marker of outcome. High miR-200c expression was associated with reduced survival in PR-negative cases (n = 68); low miR-200c expression indicated reduced survival in PR-positive cases (n = 86) (Cox regression: P = 0.002, OR = 3.433; and P = 0.004, OR = 4.176, respectively). In PR-negative cases, high miR-200c expression was associated with shortened relapse-free survival (Cox regression: P = 0.001, OR = 3.613); increased local/distant recurrence (Logistic regression: P = 0.006, OR = 3.965); and more frequent distant metastasis (Logistic regression: P = 0.015, OR = 3.390). We also found that high grade and low stage tumors were positively correlated with high miR-200c expression (Logistic regression for high grade tumors: P = 0.002, OR = 2.791 and for high stage tumors: P = 0.035, OR = 0.285). Our results indicated that miR-200c may play a role in invasive breast carcinoma. Furthermore, miR-200c combined with PR status provided a refined predictor of outcome.

Factors affecting prognosis include the size and grade of the primary lesion, regional axillary lymphadenopathy, the presence of hormonal receptors, and distant metastatic disease. Although metastatic breast disease usually affects the lungs, bones, and brain, abdominal association is not as common. Interestingly, lobular carcinoma, a subtype that only accounts for a minor portion of breast cancers, usually has luminal gastro-intestinal involvement. We describe a 57-year old Caucasian female with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and concurrent intermittent obstructive symptomatology with overflow diarrhea over a one-year period. Conventional endoscopic and imaging workup was unrevealing. Capsule endoscopy was used, but this caused a complete bowel obstruction necessitating surgery, and subsequent resection of a strictured segment. Pathological examination yielded metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with origin in breast, lobular type. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the origin. Luminal gastro-intestinal involvement is a rare, yet recognized, site of breast adenocarcinoma metastasis; it is even more uncommon with an undiagnosed primary. It may mimic other gastro-intestinal disease, and as such, it would be prudent to maintain a modest index of suspicion given the high prevalence of breast neoplasia."

To further verify the CaMBr8 prognostic value, we analysed retrospectively 862 breast cancer patients with a 19 year follow-up. In this series, CaMBr8 expression was found to be associated to some negative prognostic factors (premenopausal status, lymphnode invasion, a high number of mitosis and HER-2/neu oncoprotein expression), but had no influence on the patients' survival. Direct association with a poor prognosis was only evident in patients with lobular or mixed breast carcinoma, which however represent only a small fraction of the total breast cancers. Another possibility was that CaMBr8 could identify a subgroup of patients which did not respond to hormone therapy. To verify this hypothesis we evaluated on a second series of 116 patients the relationship between CaMBr8 expression and hormone-receptor levels. A negative association emerged which was also observed in vitro in the human breast cancer line MCF-7 treated with Sodium Butyrate, a differentiation inducer, which reduced hormone-receptor levels and increased CaMBr8 expression. In conclusion, the longer survival of CaMBr8 negative tumour patients observed in the initial study, was probably related to a better response to oophorectomy, due to the hormone-receptor level of their tumours."

Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are a population of mononuclear-phagocytic cells, which can express complex functions related to tumor biology. The present study was designed to analyse the expression of MCP-1 in parenchymal and stromal elements on frozen sections of 27 breast invasive ductal carcinomas not otherwise specified (NOS) by immunohistochemistry. The expression of MCP-1 in tumor parenchyma and the degree of tumor differentiation were assessed. MCP-1 was detected in the parenchyma in 15 of 27 ductal carcinomas. Positive immunoreactivity manifested as diffuse, homogeneous, moderate or strong, cytoplasmic staining, confined to tumor epithelium. Generally, MCP-1-negative tumors tended to be well differentiated, while chemokine-positive tumors exhibited a low level of differentiation. MCP-1 immunoreactivity was also present in TAMs (CD68 positive cells) in 23 of 27 tumors, and in endothelial cells in 11 of 27 tumors. These results indicate that parenchymal and, more variably, stromal elements of human invasive ductal carcinomas NOS can express MCP-1 in vivo. Additionally, these findings suggest that MCP-1 expression in tumor parenchyma is correlated with the histological grade of ductal invasive breast carcinoma."

The BAP1 gene (BRCA1-associated protein 1) is a tumor suppressor gene involved in DNA repair via homologous recombination. BAP1 regulates the cell cycle, differentiation, DNA damage responses, and cell proliferation through deubiquitination. Somatic mutations in the BAP1 gene are common in many types of tumors.\n    \n\n\n          Observation:\n        \n      \n      Two families harboring a germline mutation in the BAP1 gene were diagnosed at Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute (MMCI). A 27-year-old index female from one family was followed-up for multiple nevi. Her mother and uncle had malignant mesothelioma, and her maternal grandmother had uveal melanoma. The index case tested positive for a BAP1 (NM_004656.2): c.217delG/p.Asp73Metfs*5 frame-shift mutation. The melanoma was removed at the age of 28 and 31. In the second family, an 11-year-old index female had two nevi removed from her head, and a spitzoid-type skin lesion was diagnosed at the age of 11. Her 34-year-old mother had multiple nevi, and a skin lesion of spitzoid-type was removed from the abdomen. Both patients harbored a BAP1 (NM_004656.2): c.123-1G&gt;T acceptor splice site mutation (IARC [International Agency for Research on Cancer] class 4 [probably pathogenic]). Preventive measures for BAP1 syndrome should include known risks for cancer. Tumors occur early and repeatedly. At the MMCI, we recommend physical examination by an oncologist, eyes and skin examination, every 6 months; whole-body magnetic resonance imaging, including the central nervous system, every year (or low-dose computed tomography/chest and abdomen magnetic resonance imaging); annual abdominal ultrasound, breast ultrasound, or mammography; a gynecological ultrasound examination every 6 months; colonoscopy starting at the age of 45; and other suitable surveillances based on family history.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      BAP1 syndrome is a complex cancer syndrome with a high risk of rare malignant mesothelioma, malignant skin and uveal melanoma, spitzoid-type skin lesions, and other tumors.

The use of these mammographic indicators to predict patient outcome has important prognostic and therapeutic implications.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      To verify the results of previous studies conducted with smaller numbers of patients, the authors studied the 24-year survival of 714 women with 1-14-mm invasive breast carcinoma according to mammographic prognostic factors. The association of mammographic features with lymph node status, histologic malignancy grade, and 24-year survival in 714 women with invasive breast carcinomas that measured 1-14 mm also was evaluated. Adjustments were made for tumor characteristics and treatment factors in the survival analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The most common mammographic feature was a stellate lesion with no associated calcifications (420 women; 59%). Patients with stellate lesions had excellent long-term survival (95%). Casting-type calcifications were observed in 52 women (7%) and were associated significantly with a positive lymph node status (odds ratio [OR], 3.29; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.41-7.67), poorer histologic grade (OR, 7.04; 95% CI, 3.77-13.16), and an increased risk of death from breast carcinoma (HR, 9.19; 95% CI, 4.18-20.17). Except for women who had tumors with associated casting-type calcifications, all other women with tumors < 10 mm in size had excellent survival regardless of lymph node status, histologic grade, or treatment. For women who had casting-type calcifications, survival was poorer even in the group with tumors that measured 1-9 mm (72% at 20 years). For women with 10-14-mm tumors, the 20-year survival rate was 52% for those who had casting calcifications and 86-100% those for those who had other mammographic features.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The subgroup of women who had small invasive breast carcinomas accompanied by casting-type calcifications had an unexpectedly poor prognosis for this tumor-size category. The process of neoductgenesis offers a possible explanation for the unexpectedly poor outcome. There is a need to develop treatment protocols for this group and to reevaluate the present TNM classification system for mammographically detected 1-14-mm breast carcinomas. After excluding women who had tumors associated with casting-type calcifications, the remaining women had an extremely good prognosis when they were treated with surgery alone.

            "abstract": "Breast cancer has the highest incidence of all types of cancer in women. Age and family history are the strongest risk factors, but sex hormones also play an important role, as demonstrated by epidemiological studies reporting a consistent association by reproductive personal history and breast cancer risk. The acceptability of preventive strategies by healthy women is closely related to their lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Although surgical prevention may be considered in carriers of BRCA1/2 mutation, this option cannot be advocated for the majority of women whose risk is only moderately increased. In these women, chemoprevention with tamoxifen may reduce the incidence of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast carcinoma by 30-50%. Other drugs such as raloxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are currently being tested in this setting. Tamoxifen has been the most successful hormonal treatment over the last 30 years and, until recently, the most active drug in endocrine-sensitive breast cancer. In premenopausal breast cancer, tamoxifen still represents the therapy of choice, alone or in association with ovarian suppression. Conversely, in postmenopausal women it has been overtaken by third-generation AIs as first-choice drugs both in the adjuvant and metastatic settings. Many other issues, such as the optimal sequence between tamoxifen and AIs, the duration of AIs treatment, and the association of ovarian suppression and AIs in premenopausal patients still await the completion of randomized clinical trials. Furthermore, it is likely that treatment tailoring will be increased by the definition of patient subgroups that could derive larger benefits from AIs (progesterone receptor-negative, HER-2-overexpressing) or other new drugs."

            "abstract": "Meningiomas are common nervous system tumors, whose molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood. To date, the most frequent genetic alteration detected in these tumors is loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 22q. This finding led to the identification of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene on 22q12, which is inactivated in 40% of sporadic meningiomas. The NF2 gene product, merlin (or schwannomin), is a member of the protein 4.1 family of membrane-associated proteins, which also includes ezrin, radixin and moesin. Recently, we identified another protein 4.1 gene, DAL-1 (differentially expressed in adenocarcinoma of the lung) located on chromosome 18p11.3, which is lost in approximately 60% of non-small cell lung carcinomas, and exhibits growth-suppressing properties in lung cancer cell lines. Given the homology between DAL-1 and NF2 and the identification of significant LOH in the region of DAL-1 in lung, breast and brain tumors, we investigated the possibility that loss of expression of DAL-1 was important for meningioma development. In this report, we demonstrate DAL-1 loss in 60% of sporadic meningiomas using LOH, RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. Analogous to merlin, we show that DAL-1 loss is an early event in meningioma tumorigenesis, suggesting that these two protein 4.1 family members are critical growth regulators in the pathogenesis of meningiomas. Furthermore, our work supports the emerging notion that membrane-associated alterations are important in the early stages of neoplastic transformation and the study of such alterations may elucidate the mechanism of tumorigenesis shared by other tumor types."

All MMP-2 negative patients were alive during the 10 years' follow-up, compared to the 87% survival in the MMP-2 positive group. MMP-2 negativity seemed to improve the prognosis in the estrogen receptor negative group. The differences did not achieve statistical significance due to few events in the node-negative group.

S100A10 immunoreactivity in ductal carcinoma in situ (n = 51) was similar to that of invasive carcinoma. The distinct membrane-immunopositivity was correlated with high HG, severe nuclear pleomorphism, frequent mitotic counts, high Ki-67 labeling index, HER2/neu overexpression, and low estrogen receptor status (P < 0.05), but not with tubular formation, pT categories, node metastasis, vessel permeation, and pStage. Membrane overexpression of S100A10 in BC correlates with the high-grade morphological and molecular status of the carcinoma cell rather than stromal invasion and architectural deviation. Evidence points to the use of S100A10 as a biomarker representing a high-grade cellular status of BC."

            "abstract": "Transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 2 (TACC2) belongs to TACC family proteins and involved in a variety of cellular processes through interactions with some molecules involved in centrosomes/microtubules dynamics. Mounting evidence suggests that TACCs is implicated in the progression of some human malignancies, but significance of TACC2 protein in breast carcinoma is still unknown. Therefore, in this study, we examined the clinical significance of TACC2 in breast carcinoma and biological functions by immunohistochemistry and in vitro experiments. Immunohistochemistry for TACC2 was performed in 154 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 breast carcinoma cell lines were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) for TACC2, and subsequently, cell proliferation, 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and invasion assays were performed. TACC2 immunoreactivity was detected in 78 out of 154 (51%) breast carcinoma tissues, and it was significantly associated with Ki-67 LI. The immunohistochemical TACC2 status was significantly associated with increased incidence of recurrence and breast cancer-specific death of the patients, and multivariate analyses demonstrated TACC2 status as an independent prognostic factor for both disease-free and breast cancer-specific survival. Subsequent in vitro experiments showed that TACC2 significantly increased the proliferation activity of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453. These results suggest that TACC2 plays an important role in the cell proliferation of breast carcinoma and therefore immunohistochemical TACC2 status is a candidate of worse prognostic factor in breast cancer cases."

The material consisted of 53 paired breast carcinoma samples representing primary and recurrent tumors and 24 control samples. The recurrent sample was located either in the breast scar tissue or at a distant metastatic site. Apoptosis was detected both morphologically and by 3' end labeling of fragmented DNA. Cell proliferation was evaluated immunohistochemically by the MIB index. The expressions of bcl-2, bax, and estrogen and progesterone receptors were studied immunohistochemically. There was a significant increase in the extent of apoptosis and proliferation in recurrent tumors compared to the primary lesions (P = 0.015 and P = 0.038, respectively). In primary tumors with an apoptotic index of >0.50%, the survival of the patients was significantly shorter (P = 0.015). In cases with a significant increase in apoptosis or proliferation in the recurrent tumor, the survival of the patients was significantly shorter (P = 0.009 and P = 0.003, respectively). Of the variables analyzed, bcl-2 expression and a positive estrogen receptor status were significantly associated with a low extent of apoptosis (P = 0.010 and P = 0.042, respectively). Their changes were parallel to the changes in apoptosis during tumor progression, although the associations did not reach statistical significance. The results show that increased apoptosis is associated with a worse prognosis in breast carcinoma. A significant increase in apoptosis in recurrent breast carcinoma lesions predicts a worse clinical outcome."

However, controversy still exists regarding surgical staging of the axilla. Most recently, the technique of selective sentinel lymphadenectomy has been applied to staging of breast carcinoma. Our experience with this technique is presented. From July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996, 20 patients underwent 21 selective sentinel lymphadenectomies prior to level I, level II, and partial level III axillary dissections. There were 13 modified radical mastectomies and 8 segmental mastectomies. The median number of lymph nodes per specimen was 9 (range, 1-31). The sentinel node was identified in 14 patients (66%). Dual sentinel nodes were identified during 3 procedures. The sentinel nodes were negative in 9 procedures, of which all axillary nodes dissected were negative. The sentinel node was positive in 5 procedures for a 100 per cent predictive value. The sentinel node was the only positive node in 3 of the 5 patients, and 2 of these were microscopic (less than 2 mm). There were no associated complications due to the sentinel node biopsy. These results add to the growing literature supporting the feasibility of the sentinel node technique for accurately staging breast carcinoma. This technique is sensitive and specific and can be performed with minimal morbidity."

            "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) prevention remains the ultimate cost-effective method to reduce the global burden of invasive breast cancer (IBC). To date, surgery and chemoprevention remain the main risk-reducing modalities for those with hereditary cancer syndromes, as well as high-risk non-hereditary breast lesions such as ADH, ALH, or LCIS. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a preinvasive malignant lesion of the breast that closely mirrors IBC and, if left untreated, develops into IBC in up to 50% of lesions. Certain high-risk patients with DCIS may have a 25% risk of developing recurrent DCIS or IBC, even after surgical resection. The development of breast cancer elicits a strong immune response, which brings to prominence the numerous advantages associated with immune-based cancer prevention over drug-based chemoprevention, supported by the success of dendritic cell vaccines targeting HER2-expressing BC. Vaccination against BC to prevent or interrupt the process of BC development remains elusive but is a viable option. Vaccination to intercept preinvasive or premalignant breast conditions may be possible by interrupting the expression pattern of various oncodrivers. Growth factors may also function as potential immune targets to prevent breast cancer progression. Furthermore, neoantigens also serve as effective targets for interception by virtue of strong immunogenicity. It is noteworthy that the immune response also needs to be strong enough to result in target lesion elimination to avoid immunoediting as it may occur in IBC arising from DCIS. Overall, if the issue of vaccine targets can be solved by interrupting premalignant lesions, there is a potential to prevent the development of IBC."

Expression of N-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin did not correlate with patient survival. Multivariable statistical analyses of the data showed that expression of P-cadherin was independent of tumor size and lymph node metastases, but correlated inversely with estrogen/progesterone receptor status.

            "abstract": "p21WAF1/Cip1 is an inhibitor of cdk/cyclin complexes, and thus regulates the cell cycle. p21 is also related to cell differentiation and is regulated by wild-type p53, although p53-independent regulatory pathways have been proposed. In order to analyse p21 expression as well as its relationship with p53 in human breast cancer, an immunohistochemical analysis was undertaken of 77 breast carcinomas, 16 of them with an in situ component; 30 adjacent normal tissue samples; and five non-neoplastic specimens. Forty-four infiltrating carcinomas (57 per cent) were p21-positive. Expression of p21 was also observed in pre-invasive lesions, whereas normal ducts were negative or focally and weakly positive. p21 expression was associated with high histological grade (II + III) (P = 0.017) and poor tubule formation (P = 0.002), and was significantly less frequent in lobular carcinomas (P = 0.0001). p21 positivity also correlated with increased proliferation, but this seemed to be dependent on the histological grade. Twenty carcinomas (26 per cent) showed p53 overexpression, but this was not associated with p21 negativity, suggesting the existence of p53-independent mechanisms for p21 regulation in vivo. Cyclin D1CCND1 expression was analysed in the same series and an association between p21 and cyclin D1 expression was found, since 23 of 26 cyclin D1-positive carcinomas were p21-positive (P < 0.001 ...). In conclusion, p21 is frequently overexpressed in breast carcinomas and this occurs in the early stages of neoplastic progression. This overexpression seems to be independent of p53 status and might be involved in cyclin D1 modulation."

            "abstract": "ERBB2 (HER-2/neu) amplification and/or overexpression are associated with poor prognosis in node-positive breast carcinoma. Its prognostic value in node-negative cases and its predictive value for response to chemotherapy remain controversial. This may be related to the use of molecular methods, which are sensitive to dilution of tumor material by normal cells, or the use of nonstandardized immunohistochemistry (IHC) procedures, for the determination of the ERBB2 gene status. In addition, new therapeutic approaches that target the cells overexpressing ERBB2 are under development. These perspectives necessitate a reliable evaluation of the status of ERBB2 in individual tumors before the application of specific therapeutic strategies. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and IHC allow the evaluation of the ERBB2 status specifically in tumor cells on archival material. We have analyzed a series of 100 invasive ductal breast carcinomas without lymph node invasion both by IHC, using the CB11 monoclonal antibody and a sensitive Auidin Biotin Complex (ABC) immunodetection system, and by FISH, using the Oncor Inform HER-21neu (ERBB2) gene amplification detection system as reference technique. Complete concordance between the results of FISH and IHC was seen in 98% of the cases. ERBB2 amplification (more than four signals per nucleus) was observed in 12 of the 100 cases, and all but one showed an overexpression of the protein (membrane staining) by IHC. Conversely, ERBB2 expression was present in one case without gene amplification. In conclusion, ERBB2 overexpression detected by IHC is highly correlated to gene amplification detected by FISH. Thus, under standardized conditions, IHC is a reliable and economical test to assess the ERBB2 status in tumors. The use of FISH could be limited to the verification of the status of tumors displaying a weak membrane immunostaining."

            "abstract": "Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common breast cancer. Our study used gene microarray data to select differentially expressed genes between normal and IDC mammary tissues. From these, we selected genes related to the proliferation of tumor cells and compared their prognostic value with known biomarker Ki67 for IDC. Analysis of publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data revealed 24 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in normal and 31 DEGS in IDC tissues that were used for further analyses. Gene chip analysis software was used to identify DEGs. DEG profiles were confirmed using quantitative PCR (qPCR). DEG functions where shown to be related to cell proliferation. We confirmed MCM3 expression using immunohistochemical staining in 45 IDC patients. The relationship between MCM3 expression and survival was investigated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazard regression models. A total of 1307 differentially expressed genes were identified between IDC and normal tissues, which were enriched in 32 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 9 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. qPCR demonstrated that both COL1A1 and MCM3 were significantly up-regulated in IDC tissues, of which only MCM3 was related to cell proliferation. Ki67 is closely associated with the tumor grade, ER status, PR status and HER2 status, while MCM3 was shown to relate to tumor size, lymph node, and PR status. There was significant association between survival and MCM3, but not for Ki67. High MCM3 expression demonstrated statistically significant associations with poor prognosis in IDC patients. Findings from the gene microarray data analysis confirmed that MCM3 is associated with the response to cell proliferation. MCM3 represents a better proliferation marker than Ki67 making it a valuable prognostic tool that is independent of ER and HER2 status."

            "abstract": "Haplotype-based association studies have been proposed as a powerful comprehensive approach to identify causal genetic variation underlying complex diseases. Data comparisons within families offer the additional advantage of dealing naturally with complex sources of noise, confounding and population stratification. Two problems encountered when investigating associations between haplotypes and a continuous trait using data from sibships are (i) the need to define within-sibship comparisons for sibships of size greater than two and (ii) the difficulty of resolving the joint distribution of haplotype pairs within sibships in the absence of parental genotypes. We therefore propose first a method of orthogonal transformation of both outcomes and exposures that allow the decomposition of between- and within-sibship regression effects when sibship size is greater than two. We conducted a simulation study, which confirmed analysis using all members of a sibship is statistically more powerful than methods based on cross-sectional analysis or using subsets of sib-pairs. Second, we propose a simple permutation approach to avoid errors of inference due to the within-sibship correlation of any errors in haplotype assignment. These methods were applied to investigate the association between mammographic density (MD), a continuously distributed and heritable risk factor for breast cancer, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes from the VDR gene using data from a study of 430 twins and sisters. We found evidence of association between MD and a 4-SNP VDR haplotype. In conclusion, our proposed method retains the benefits of the between- and within-pair analysis for pairs of siblings and can be implemented in standard software."

Thirty-four of the 36 women classified on family environment type of the Family Environment Scale (FES) were from Personal Growth-Oriented families. Comparisons of women with and without personal cancer histories resulted in a trend for women with personal cancer histories to be classified as from Independence-Oriented families. Reported distress appears to vary for different family emphases based on family and personal cancer history. A moral-religious family emphasis consistently appeared to be associated with decreased psychological distress. Preliminary analyses comparing these community women (who were not part of a hereditary registry but were self- or physician-referred) seeking genetic testing with normal and distressed family means found that increased cohesion and expressiveness may be related to decreased conflict, indicative of potentially supportive family environments for these women. When compared with normative data, a subset consisting of the Ashkenazi Jewish women showed a trend of less cohesion than normal families, but similar cohesion levels as distressed families."

Surgery was the first step of treatment, associated with SN procedure and with BM aspiration for the detection of OTC. SN was histologically classified as negative, metastatic (>2mm), micro-metastatic (>0.2mm and 2mm) or involved by OTC detected by immunohistochemistry (Ni+, 0.2mm). BM specimens were analysed after immunocytochemistry and classified as negative or positive with atypical cytokeratin-positive OTC. Metastasis and micro-metastasis in the SN were correlated with size, grade and vascular invasion. In contrast, presence of OTC in both SN and BM was independent of these parameters but positively associated with lobular type. This correlation was also observed for BM status, which was similarly independent of the tumour characteristics. No association was found between SN status and BM status. Our data indicate that, in the course of breast cancer, OTC spreading is frequent and could be an early event, related to lobular histological type but independent of classical histoprognostic parameters, and that the loco-regional metastatic spread of OTC is not a prerequisite for systemic involvement."

We found statistically significant correlations in PMD between cases (n = 228) and sister controls (n = 228) (r = 0.39 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.50; P <0.0001)), but not between cases and unrelated controls (n = 228) (r = 0.04 (95% CI: -0.09, 0.17; P = 0.51)). After adjusting for other risk factors, square root transformed PMD was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer when comparing cases to sister controls (adjusted odds ratio (inter-quintile odds ratio (IQOR) = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.20, 4.00) or to unrelated controls (adjusted IQOR = 2.62, 95% CI = 1.62, 4.25).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The use of sister controls in case-control studies of PMD resulted in a modest attenuation of case-control differences and risk estimates, but showed a statistically significant association with risk and allowed control for race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status and family history."

            "abstract": "In the context of a traumatic event, such as a breast cancer diagnosis, talking with others about the event can facilitate emotional adjustment and meaning-finding. Among women with a history of breast cancer, open communication is likely to be of particular importance in the family setting, as the family is frequently a primary source of support. The goal of this cross-sectional survey study was to determine the association between open family communication about cancer and breast cancer survivors' mental health. Responses from 230 women at various stages post-treatment suggest that the majority of women are able to talk openly with their family about breast cancer. Multivariate regression analysis further indicates that open family communication is independently associated with better mental health outcomes. Given that many women live long after a breast cancer diagnosis, maintaining mental health functioning is an important long-term goal. Efforts to enhance productive communication between patients and their family members may help women cope with and overcome the challenges of breast cancer survivorship."

Controls (n = 799) admitted to the same hospitals for nonmalignant conditions were matched to cases on age, sex, race/ethnicity, hospital, and proximity of residence to hospital. We found that risk of meningioma was increased among persons reporting a family history of a benign brain tumor (odds ratio [OR], 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-21.0; n = 5) or melanoma (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.2-15.0; n 5). A family history of breast cancer was associated with an elevated meningioma risk among participants aged 18 to 49 years (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.4-11.0; n = 8) but a reduced risk among older respondents (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7; n = 3). Family history of cancer did not differ between schwannoma cases and controls, although the statistical power to detect associations was limited. Some relative risk estimates were based on a small number of observations and may have arisen by chance. Inheritance of predisposing genes, shared environmental factors, or both within families with a history of benign brain tumors, melanoma, or possibly breast cancer may be related to altered meningioma risk."

Each case requires an individual decision taking into account the stage of disease, patient preferences and gestational age. Above chemotherapy, it is only recommended after the first trimester of pregnancy and anthracyclin-based schemes have the higher evidence, but taxanes are also considered as an alternative in patients who do not respond to anthracyclines or its use is contraindicated. For the time being, there is a lack of data, and clinical decisions are based on small retrospective cohorts, case-control studies and case reports. We report two cases of patients being diagnosed with breast cancer while being pregnant and treated with surgery and chemotherapy, including anthracyclines, during the second and third trimester of pregnancy. In both reported cases, childbirth was induced before the 37th week of gestation and only one presented low birth weight with no more complications.

This study has investigated the associations of gene expression of enzymes metabolizing anticancer drugs with therapy response and survival of breast carcinoma patients. Gene expression of 13 aldo-keto reductases (AKRs), carbonyl reductase 1, and 10 cytochromes P450 (CYPs) was assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in tumors and paired adjacent nonneoplastic tissues from 68 posttreatment breast carcinoma patients. Eleven candidate genes were then evaluated in an independent series of 50 pretreatment patients. Protein expression of the most significant genes was confirmed by immunoblotting. AKR1A1 was significantly overexpressed and AKR1C1-4, KCNAB1, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 downregulated in tumors compared with control nonneoplastic tissues after correction for multiple testing. Significant association of CYP2B6 transcript levels in tumors with expression of hormonal receptors was found in the posttreatment set and replicated in the pretreatment set of patients. Significantly higher intratumoral levels of AKR1C1, AKR1C2, or CYP2W1 were found in responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with nonresponders. Patients with high AKR7A3 or CYP2B6 levels in the pretreatment set had significantly longer disease-free survival than patients with low levels. Protein products of AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR7A3, CYP3A4, and carbonyl reductase (CBR1) were found in tumors and those of AKR1C1, AKR7A3, and CBR1 correlated with their transcript levels. Small interfering RNA-directed knockdown of AKR1C2 or vector-mediated upregulation of CYP3A4 in MDA-MB-231 model cell line had no effect on cell proliferation after paclitaxel treatment in vitro. Prognostic and predictive roles of drug-metabolizing enzymes strikingly differ between posttreatment and pretreatment breast carcinoma patients. Mechanisms of action of AKR1C2, AKR7A3, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and CBR1 should continue to be further followed in breast carcinoma patients and models."

This human clone was constructed by fusing the human lymphoma cell line (Ball-1) and peripheral blood lymphocytes from a breast cancer patient in active immunological remission of her disease. Several benign and malignant breast lesions in addition to a variety of apparently normal human tissues have been stained. To date, a variety of breast carcinomas have stained positively with JDB1, while normal breast tissue samples as well as other forms of malignant tissue were negative for staining. In addition, unlike most commercially available murine monoclonals, JDB1 was able to identify metastatic infiltrating ductal carcinoma to both axillary nodes and skin. These results represent one of the first reported findings of immunostaining using a human monoclonal antibody on paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed human breast carcinoma.

            "abstract": "Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP) was purified and cloned 10 years ago as a factor responsible for the hypercalcemia associated with malignancy. Clinical evidence supports another important role for PTH-rP in malignancy as a mediator of the bone destruction associated with osteolytic metastasis. Patients with PTH-rP positive breast carcinoma are more likely to develop bone metastasis. In addition, breast carcinoma metastatic to bone expresses PTH-rP in >90% of cases, compared with only 17% of metastasis to nonbone sites. These observations suggest that PTH-rP expression by breast carcinoma cells may provide a selective growth advantage in bone due to its ability to stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption. Furthermore, growth factors such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which are abundant in bone matrix, are released and activated by osteoclastic bone resorption and may enhance PTH-rP expression and tumor cell growth. To investigate the role of PTH-rP in the pathophysiology of breast carcinoma metastasis to bone, the human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 was studied in a murine model of human breast carcinoma metastasis to bone. A series of experiments were performed in which 1) PTH-rP secretion was altered, 2) the effects of PTH-rP were neutralized, or 3) the responsiveness to TGF-beta was abolished in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cultured MDA-MB-231 cells secreted low amounts of PTH-rP that increased fivefold in response to TGF-beta. Tumor cells inoculated into the left cardiac ventricle of nude mice caused osteolytic metastasis similar to that observed in humans with breast carcinoma. When PTH-rP was overexpressed in the tumor cells, bone metastases were increased. MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with the cDNA for human preproPTH-rP secreted a tenfold greater amount of PTH-rP and caused significantly greater bone metastases when inoculated into the left cardiac ventricle of female nude mice compared with parental cells. In contrast, when the biologic effects of PTH-rP were neutralized or its production was suppressed, such metastases were decreased. Treatment of mice with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to human PTH-rP resulted in a decrease in the development and progression of bone metastasis due to the parental MDA-MB-231 cells. Similar results were observed when mice were treated with dexamethasone, a potent glucocorticoid that suppresses production of PTH-rP by the MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro. The role of bone-derived TGF-beta in the development and progression of bone metastasis was studied by transfecting MDA-MB-231 cells with a cDNA encoding a TGF-beta type II receptor lacking a cytoplasmic domain, which acts as a dominant negative to block the cellular response to TGF-beta. Stable clones expressing this mutant receptor (MDA/TbetaRIIdeltacyt) did not increase PTH-rP secretion in response to TGF-beta stimulation compared with controls of untransfected MDA-MB-231 or those transfected with the empty vector. Mice inoculated into the left cardiac ventricle with MDA/TbetaRIIdeltacyt had fewer and smaller bone metastases as assessed radiographically and histomorphometrically compared with controls. Taken together, these data suggest that PTH-rP expression by breast carcinoma cells enhance the development and progression of breast carcinoma metastasis to bone. Furthermore, TGF-beta responsiveness of breast carcinoma cells may be important for the expression of PTH-rP in bone and the development of osteolytic bone metastasis in vivo. These interactions define a critical feedback loop between breast carcinoma cells and the bone microenvironment that may be responsible for the alacrity with which breast carcinoma grows in bone."

In that case, the hypothesis is that decisions are based on the expected utility. The theory assumes weighting and computation of complete possibilities with their associated probabilities and values. However values exhibits a wide inter-individual variation range. Therefore the predictability of choice based on this model is indeed very low. Furthermore it is likely that the willingness of pregnancy after breast cancer contains besides classic constituents of appeals of motherhood, a specific meaning of recovery both of health and femininity. The second question: who is in charge of the decision? And under the paradigm of autonomy, women' decision is, merely by itself, the right decision. The last question is how? For some situations for which foreseeing is quiet complex, the value of the process in itself is increased and could help the end-oriented or self-determined decision.

            "abstract": "Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) refers to the unique capability of aggressive tumor cells to mimic the pattern of embryonic vasculogenic networks. In the study we demonstrated that CD133 expression was the highest in triple-negative (TN) breast cancer specimens. Importantly, VM showed statistical correlation with CD133(+) expression. The presence of the close relationship between VM and CD133(+) expression might be central for TN tumor relapse and progression. The TN breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 cells developed a range of colony morphologies paralleling the holoclone, meroclone and paraclone morphologies produced by normal keratinocytes and other epithelial cancer cell lines when plated at clonal densities. Holoclone cells were capable of forming more colonies on soft agar than meroclone cells and paraclone cells, suggesting that holoclone cells had higher self-renew potential and might harbors cancer stem cells (CSCs) subpopulation. Strikingly, it was holoclone that displayed CD133(+) phenotype and formed VM. In addition, holoclone acquired endothelial cell marker vascular endothelial-cadherin expression and upregulated VM mediators matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expression. The subpopulation with holoclone morphology, CD133(+) phenotype and CSCs characteristics might have the capacity of transdifferentiation and contributed to VM in TN breast cancer. The related molecular pathways may be used as novel therapeutic targets for the inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis in TN breast carcinoma."

            "abstract": "Degradation of extracellular matrix takes place in areas of cell-matrix contacts and is partly carried out by the action of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). MMP-2 is a member of the MMP family that has been associated with breast-cancer metastasis. In the present study, we investigated the association of MMP-2 to the surface of breast-cancer cells and revealed an MMP-2-binding site that is expressed on sparsely plated cells and which is progressively lost as the cells approach confluence. Gelatin zymography, immunostaining and flow cytometry of MDA-MB-231 cells from sparse cultures demonstrated binding both of latent and of activated exogenous MMP-2, while little or no binding of MMP-2 was observed in confluent culture. Analysis of the expression of MTI-MMP, TIMP-2 and alpha(v) integrin, 3 proteins shown to play a role in cell-surface association of MMP-2, revealed enhanced levels of these proteins in confluent MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, the reduced MMP-2 binding to confluent cells is not related to a deficiency in these MMP-2-binding proteins. Taken together, these studies suggest that MMP-2 binding to the surface of breast-cancer cells is regulated by cell-cell interactions and that tumor cells invading from the main tumor mass can up-regulate their MMP-2-binding capacity to acquire greater invasive capacity."

The multigene methylation was examined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay in serum of 50 SBCs and 50 paired nontumors, and CIMP+ was defined as having three genes that are concordantly methylated. The methylation frequency of ten genes in serum of 50 SBCs varied from 10% in FHIT to 74% in RASSF1A. The methylation status of RASSF1A, BRCA1, p16, CDH1, ER, RARbeta2, APC, and DAPK was significantly correlated with SBC and nontumor serum (P < 0.05). Methylation of at least one gene was found in 92% SBC; CIMP was more frequent in SBC than nontumor serum (P < 0.001). There was a significant association between CIMP and methylation of RASSF1A, BRCA1, p16, CDH1, ER, RARbeta2, APC, and DAPK (P < 0.05); the methylation link profile of CDH1, RASSF1A, BRCA1, and RARbeta2 as breast cancer marker may contribute high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (88%). ER and RARbeta2 methylation was associated with elevated serum CA153 levels in 39 SBC samples with CIMP+ (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that living area of patients was found to provide independent prognostic information associated with a relative risk of tumor recurrence of 5.3. Multigene-specific methylation profile in serum was association with the recurrence risk of rural SBC, and positive correlation of CIMP can serve as a promising molecular marker of SBC."

LOH at the DCC locus was detected in 15 (51.7%) of 29 informative cases and 10 of 13 cases having DCC-LOH showed distinct reduction or loss of DCC expression. The DCC-LOH was closely associated with certain histological phenotypes: DCC-LOH was more frequent in scirrhous carcinomas than in solid-tubular ones (P < 0.05), and was also more frequent in carcinomas with infiltration into fat tissue over the mammary gland than in those without infiltration (P < 0.05).

To understand the role of angiogenin in cancer progression, we evaluated the expression of angiogenin in 459 cases with primary breast carcinoma and in 40 benign breast specimens using an immunoassay. Higher angiogenin concentrations were observed in carcinomas in comparison with fibrocystic disease (mean, 17.3 versus 10.9 ng/mg; P = 0.008), but not with fibroadenomas. We selected 5 ng/mg cytosol protein of angiogenin as the normal cutoff for primary breast carcinoma. Eighty-eight percent of carcinomas expressed elevated angiogenin levels and 12% had low levels. We observed an association between elevated levels of angiogenin and low/ moderate histological grade (P = 0.001) and small tumor size (P = 0.026), but not with age, menopausal status, lymph node status, stage of disease, or hormonal receptor status. With a median follow-up of 31 months, breast cancer patients with elevated angiogenin levels had significantly longer disease-free survival (DFS) than patients with low angiogenin (log-rank, P = 0.003). This effect was equally observed in node-negative and node-positive cases. In a multivariate analysis of DFS, only angiogenin, tumor size, and histological grade showed statistical significance. A multivariate analysis of overall survival showed that angiogenin and tumor size were the only significant variables. Serum samples from the breast cancer patients at the time of surgery were available in 194 cases. We evaluated the levels of circulating angiogenin using the same immunoassay as in tumor tissue. Serum angiogenin levels were higher in cancer patients than in 40 healthy controls (mean, 401.2 versus 206.0 ng/ml; P < 0.0001). In breast cancer patients, we observed no correlation between the serum concentrations and the tissue levels of angiogenin (r = 0.115; P = 0.110). In addition, serum levels of angiogenin did not have a prognostic impact on the DFS of breast cancer patients (log-rank, P = 0.581). Our results indicate that elevated levels of tissue angiogenin, but not of circulating angiogenin, are a favorable prognostic factor in primary breast carcinoma, which is consistent with a role of angiogenin as a cancer cell substrate."

We have identified hMLH1 mutations in 2 Amsterdam-criteria HNPCC families where both male and female gene carriers were affected with breast cancer. To investigate whether these breast cancers were caused by other genetic factors, we analyzed the 2 breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. In one family we did not find any mutation in the breast cancer genes, while in the other, a BRCA1 mutation segregated in the breast cancer cases. Hereditary breast cancer, and in particular BRCA1 tumors, display discrete histo-pathological and immunohistological characteristics. The tumor from a woman with both hMLH1 mutations and a BRCA1 mutation exhibited typical BRCA1 histology, e.g., grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma with dense lymphocytic infiltration, and immunohistology, estrogen receptor (ER) negative, progesterone receptor (PgR) negative, strongly p53 positive, c-erbB-2 negative and highly Ki67 positive (>50% stained cells). The histology of the breast tumor from the man with both one hMLH1 mutation and a BRCA1 mutation was a grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma without any special BRCA1 features. Immunohistology was also different. This might merely reflect a true difference in male breast tumor progression vs. female.

            "abstract": "The abundant expression of progesterone receptors (PR) in human meningiomas is well established. It is unknown, however, how PR expression is regulated, especially since estrogen receptors (ER) are virtually absent in these tumors. At the mRNA level, ER splice variants occur in meningioma but these appear not to be involved in the apparently autonomous PR expression. In an earlier study, because other ER-inducible proteins were either not expressed at all (pS2) or were expressed at a very low level compared to their expression in breast cancer (Cathepsin-D), the authors have postulated that the autonomous PR expression in meningioma is PR promoter-related rather than ER-related and have studied PR expression in cultured meningioma cells. PR levels appeared to decrease rapidly in vitro in monolayer as well as in three dimensional spheroid cultures. Culture conditions thus are not yet sufficient for the quantitative evaluation of PR expression. To evaluate whether PR deterioration is associated with cell turnover (meningiomas grow much faster in vitro than in vivo), the relationship between expression of the apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bax and PR expression was investigated. Bcl-2 expression was found to be highest in meningioma with low PR levels, and in breast cancer tissue with high PR levels. Bax expression was not related to PR expression in any of the two tissues. Given the potential benefit of antiprogestin treatment and the occurrence in meningiomas of a protein capable of binding to the estrogen-responsive element, the expression of PR in meningioma remains a fascinating phenomenon which requires further investigation."

Previous studies have elegantly demonstrated the progression of benign MGA to atypical MGA to MGA-in situ carcinoma to invasive carcinoma and therefore suggest MGA as a possible non-obligate precursor lesion to a subset of breast carcinomas. Immunohistochemically, MGA is negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2-neu oncoprotein expression, and carcinomas arising in the setting of MGA are often reported to be triple negative. In this article, we present a unique case of an ER+/PR+/HER2- invasive carcinoma associated with MGA and atypical MGA. Our case highlights the diagnostic pitfall of MGA and suggests that MGA is a heterogeneous group of lesions with potential for either luminal-type or basal-type differentiation during progression to breast carcinoma."

In this study, we review the immunomorphologic characteristics of SPCs diagnosed at our institution, with a view toward elucidating points of distinction from other mammary carcinomas that manifest neuroendocrine differentiation. A total of 250 cases of in situ and invasive carcinomas with immunohistochemically documented neuroendocrine differentiation, spanning 12 years, were retrieved from the records of the Department of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital. Morphologic review identified 108 (43.2%) cases of SPC (in situ and/or invasive) among this group of tumors. Tumors with SPC components were significantly associated with estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and chromogranin A expression, spindled tumor morphology, and older patient age (above median age). In addition, invasive carcinomas with SPC components were more likely to be of smaller size (≤20 mm), low grade (grade 1), and to occur in older patients (above median age), compared with cases of invasive carcinoma lacking an SPC component. In situ SPCs were significantly associated with mucin production and demonstrated improved disease-free survival over cases of conventional ductal carcinoma in situ with neuroendocrine differentiation. Presence of an SPC pattern is associated with favorable clinicopathologic characteristics, with in situ SPCs demonstrating improved disease-free survival, emphasizing the importance of accurately diagnosing this uncommon tumor."

Normal mammary epithelium anatomically located in the TDLU was shown to be biologically associated with cancerous change, particularly in specimens from patients who subsequently developed invasive carcinoma. Atypical ductal hyperplasia as well as DCIS expressed breast cancer associated antigen, providing further biological evidence that the atypical lesion at the TDLU are premalignant. Intraductal spread of carcinoma was defined as \"DCIS was present clearly extending beyond the TDLU, or present prominently within the large ducts,\" and was classified into 3 grades according to the distribution of carcinoma in the duct-lobular system. We have developed a breast-conserving surgery consisting of quadrantectomy and regional lymph node dissection and immediate volume replacement using lateral tissue-flap (LTF). The quadrantectomy was employed on the basis of segmental anatomy of the duct-lobular system in which breast carcinoma originates. Fairly good cosmetic outcome as well as local control were obtained in the patients who underwent the immediate volume replacement using LTF.

The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the role of chromosome 1 and 8 copy number assessed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), as prognostic parameters in 50 Iranian women, aged 35 to 64 years, with sporadic invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Chromosome 1 and 8 copy numbers were evaluated in relation to established clinicopathological parameters, the immunohistochemical markers ER, PR, P53 and cathepsin D, DNA index by flow cytometry, age and survival status of the patients. FISH using centromeric probes for chromosomes 1 and 8 was applied to interphase cell suspensions prepared from archived, Carnoyfixed tumor cells and selected paraffin-embedded tumor sections. Aneusomy for chromosomes 1 and 8 was present in all 50 patients to different levels.

However, unlike breast cancer, meningiomas are much more commonly positive for progesterone receptors than for estrogen receptors. The authors initiated a study on long-term oral therapy of unresectable meningiomas with the antiprogesterone mifepristone (RU486). Fourteen patients received mifepristone in daily doses of 200 mg for periods ranging from 2 to 31+ months (greater than or equal to 6 months in 12 patients). Five patients have shown signs of objective response (reduced tumor measurement on computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance image, or improved visual field examination).

Intriguingly, 88 % (44/50) cases of grade 3 triple-negative breast carcinoma showed uniformly strong EZH2 expression with a multiplicative score of 9. The percentage of EZH2 overexpression in ER-positive breast carcinoma with a high proliferative index or HER2-positive cases were 61.2 and 74 %, respectively. Furthermore, EZH2 expression was significantly elevated in high-grade DCIS compared to benign lesions (90 % versus 0, p < 0.001). However, there is no association between EZH2 expression and the status of histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation or other clinicopathologic features.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In summary, triple-negative breast carcinoma showed the highest overexpression of EZH2. EZH2 overexpression is associated aggressive pathologic features including high nuclear grade, high proliferative index, and positivity of HER2 of breast carcinoma."

Some genes (promoters and suppressors) control this process and certain mutations may induce the expression of abnormal proteins, which can be detected by immunohistochemical staining. Apoptosis can be detected by the TUNEL method either identifying apoptotic bodies or cells at the initial stages of the fragmentation process. We have studied 186 cases of infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma, stages pT1-pT2, and analysed the prognostic significance of tumour recurrence and overall survival of apoptotic index (AI) through univariate and multivariate analysis. We have also studied the immunohistochemical protein expression of apoptosis promoter and suppressors gene (p53, nuclear expression; bcl-2 and Bax, cytoplasm expression; BAG-1, nuclear and cytoplasm expression). The results indicate prognostic significance of p53 and bcl-2 related to patient death and bcl-2 and tumour size to tumour recurrence, bcl-2 acting as a protector factor (apoptotic suppressor) in both situations. On the other hand, we have not found useful prognostic information of AI either to tumour recurrence or overall survival in univariate or multivariate studies. In this study, Bax expression does not provide a new prognostic role in breast carcinoma, although it contrasts to the bcl-2 action and accelerates death."

Survival analysis in a group of 142 women with breast carcinoma demonstrated that TPO.Ab titres > or = 0.3 U/mL were associated with a significantly better disease-free [relative risk (RR) = 1.84, P < 0.05] and overall survival (RR = 3.46, P < 0.02), compared with those who were TPO.Ab-negative. Better outcome associated with higher TPO.Ab titres was confined to those who had thyroid volumes within the intermediate range (10.1-18.8 mL) and did not further enhance the good outcome recorded when volumes were < or = 10.0 mL or > 18.8 mL. Multivariate survival analysis showed that both TPO.Ab and thyroid volume were independently associated with prognosis in breast carcinoma and that RRs for disease-free survival were of a similar order of magnitude to well-established prognostic indices such as axillary nodal status or tumor size. These findings supply evidence that manifestations of thyroid autoimmunity are associated with a beneficial effect on disease outcome in breast carcinoma and provide the strongest evidence to date of a biological link between breast carcinoma and thyroid disease."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to verify, according to our experience, the prognostic significance of Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) in breast carcinoma patients in association with other new prognostic factors. In this study 148 consecutive specimens of breast carcinoma patients were analyzed.

The Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) was calculated from the pathological information and patients were grouped according to the standard NPI index into: good prognostic group (GPG), moderate prognostic group (MPG), and poor prognostic group (PPG). The correlation of prognostic groups according to the NPI with other prognostic and predictive factors such as age, ER, PR, p53, bcl-2, Ki-67, nm23, Ki-67, Cathepsin D and HER-2/neu on overall survival was analyzed. The results of univariate analysis showed statistically significant correlation between patients' age, NPI prognostic groups and stage of disease with patients survival. When other prognostic factors were correlated with NPI prognostic groups there was not additional prognostic discrimination in given prognostic groups. Only marginally statistically significant influence of p53 expression was found on patient survival between MPG and PPG.

We analysed serum samples from patients with breast carcinoma (n = 196) and controls (n = 64) for the level of Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) antigen-specific antibody isotypes, their sialylation, interrelationships, and the avidity by using ELISA with the synthetic TF-polyacrylamide conjugate as an antigen and the sialic acid-specific Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) and ammonium thiocyanate as a chaotrope. An increased sialylation of IgG and IgM, but a lower SNA reactivity of IgA TF antibodies, and a higher level and avidity of the TF-specific IgA were found in cancer patients. Other cancer-related signatures were the highly significant increase of the IgG/IgA ratio and the very low SNA/IgA index in cancer, including patients with an early stage of the disease. These changes showed a good diagnostic potential with about 80% accuracy. Thus, the level of naturally occurring anti-TF antigen antibodies, their sialylation profile, isotype distribution, and avidity displayed cancer-specific changes that could serve as novel noninvasive Ab-based biomarkers for early breast cancer."

The diagnosis of BC often results in negative cognitive processes, such as appraisals of harm/loss, intrusive thoughts, and depressive rumination, all of which contribute to the occurrence of depression in both the patient and spouse. The present research is a cross-sectional exploration of the mediating role of depressive rumination in the relationships of intrusive thoughts and appraisal of harm/loss with depression, in a sample of 56 BC patients and their partners. We hypothesized that depressive rumination would mediate the relationships between cognitive processes and depression in both BC patient and their partners. Participants completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms, depressive rumination, cognitive appraisals, and intrusive thoughts. Path analyses using hierarchical linear regression were conducted to assess the relationships among variables. Results indicated that for BC patients, harm/loss appraisals and intrusive thoughts had direct effects on depression; only harm/loss appraisals had indirect effects through depressive rumination. For partners, both harm/loss appraisal and intrusive thoughts had direct effects on depression, and both had indirect effects through depressive rumination. Dyadic analysis showed no relation of partner cognitive variables with patient depression or patient cognitive variables with partner depression. Findings show that the perseverative practice of dwelling on these negative thoughts of loss and harm relates to depressive symptoms.

In cancer research, much effort has been made to find the amplified loci of cancer DNAs, because many lines of evidence indicate association between oncogene amplification and carcinogenesis. Conventionally, such gene amplification has been detected by using Southern hybridization with DNA probes. However, only the information of one locus can be obtained by one hybridization procedure, and analysis of many loci throughout the genome is too laborious and time consuming, even if only several candidate genes are investigated. On the other hand, the \"in-gel renaturation method\" was reported as another alternative for detection of amplified regions. However, even though this method is much improved, it is difficult to detect less than 7-fold amplification, which is often higher than the amplification of many cancer cases. To overcome these limitations and, in addition, to locate the amplified DNA two dimensionally, we applied RLGS for analysis of DNA amplification in cancer tissues, such as breast cancer (infiltrative tubuloadenocarcinoma), neuroblastoma, meningioma (endotheliomatous meningioma), and thyroid cancer (papillary adenocarcinoma). In some cases of breast cancer, several amplified spots located on the same amplicon were detected. In thyroid cancer, in which no amplification has yet been reported, low-grade amplification was also detected. In this report, we demonstrated that RLGS allows us to screen 2000-3000 restriction landmarks distributed on the genome simultaneously, and even low-grade amplification could be detected effectively. Thus, RLGS has proven to be a very useful method in detecting DNA amplification."

To examine whether risk factors for carcinoma in situ correspond with risk factors for invasive breast cancer, we analyzed data from a population-based case-control study conducted in 1988-1990. We identified newly diagnosed cases of carcinoma in situ (n = 301) and invasive breast cancer (n = 3789) in women 18-74 years of age from Wisconsin's statewide tumor registry. Cases and population controls (n = 3999) completed structured telephone interviews. Overall, associations with risk of carcinoma in situ in relation to many reproductive life-style risk factors were similar to those associated with risk of invasive disease. Women who reported a family history of breast cancer had a 2-fold elevated risk of carcinoma in situ (odds ratio, 2.67; 95% confidence interval, 2.00-3.57). Personal history of benign biopsied breast disease also increased risk of carcinoma in situ (odds ratio, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.62-2.95). Subgroup analysis suggested that high vitamin A intake and high alcohol intake may be associated with risk of ductal but not lobular carcinoma in situ.

Recently, the somatostatin analog pentetreotide was labeled with In-111 (OctreoScan 111, Mallinckrodt Medical BV, Petten, Holland) and introduced for the in vivo visualization in man of SR-positive tissues. In the present report, SR-specific scintigraphy is evaluated as a clinical tool for tissue characterization in correlation with histological and radiological examinations. Scintigraphy was focused and performed in cancer types without neuroendocrine tissue expression such as brain (n = 6) and breast tumors (n = 9) and lymphomas (n = 5). Scintigraphy was performed for comparison at 6 and 22 h after i.v. application of 111 MBq (3 mCi) of In-111-Pentetreotide. In the breast cancer group, the primary tumor was visualized in all 9 women as well as in all 4 cases with palpable axillary lymph nodes. Three women with a negative axillary node scan and impalpable nodes had positive biopsy. In two cases, mediastinal lymph node involvement was observed. So far the role of SR-positive breast cancer (BC) scans remains unknown. It is tempting to speculate that in resected women who are histologically and scintigraphically SR positive, it might be of value in the early detection of symptom-free recurrences. High densities of SR were present within both meningiomas, the high-grade astrocytoma and the craniopharyngioma. Differentiation of low- and high-grade astrocytomas could not be successfully achieved because both grades showed intense radioactivity uptake, even though high-grade tumors lack SR. The latter might be due to the damaged blood-brain barrier and the poor radioactivity washout observed in high-grade astrocytomas. All five lymphomas could be detected due to the presence of activated lymphocytes and macrophages that express SR at a sufficient density. In conclusion, SR scintigraphy in non-neuroendocrine malignancies does not seem to be reliable for an initial tumor staging but rather more suitable for a tissue characterization and extremely useful for monitoring changes of SR expression after treatment."

            "abstract": "A ten-year follow-up study of 382 women with Stage I (T1N0M0) breast carcinoma revealed recurrence and/or death due to cancer in 16% of the patients. Among 134 patients (35%) with a primary tumor 1.0 cm or less in diameter (Group A), 7% had recurrences and 5% died of breast carcinoma. Recurrences were observed in 21% of the 248 women with a tumor 1.1-2.0 cm in diameter (Group B), and 15% died of disease. These differences in recurrence and mortality rates were statistically significant. All recurrences were due to infiltrating duct or lobular carcinoma which accounted for 91% of the 382 carcinomas. Most strongly linked to recurrence was the finding of tumor emboli in lymphatics of the breast. This was found in 23 Group B patients and ten of them (43%) died of disease. No recurrences were observed among the seven Group A patients with lymphatic emboli. Other features associated with a significantly increased risk of recurrence were poorly differentiated carcinoma, marked lymphoid reaction to tumor, and menarche before age 12 years or after age 14 years. No combination of variables proved to identify a subset of patients with an especially increased or low risk of recurrence. Stage I patients with lymphatic tumor emboli in the breast surrounding a carcinoma 1.1-2.0 cm in diameter have a sufficient risk for recurrence to warrant consideration of adjuvant systemic therapy. A very low risk of recurrence was observed for the following: any tumor 1.0 cm or smaller; and tubular, medullary or colloid carcinoma up to 2.0 cm."

Fifty six specimens of tumor tissue were collected consecutively, and CD expression in tumor tissue and tissue macrophages was determined by standard immunohistochemistry using the aNCL-CDm anti-cathepsin D mouse monoclonal antibody (Novocastra Laboratories Ltd., Newcastle, UK). Additionally, CD concentration was determined by ELISA in cytosol of the same breast carcinoma specimens. CD positivity was correlated with tumor size, histological grade of tumor, and the cytosol progesterone adn estrogen receptor concentrations. There was no statistically significant correlation between examined parameters and either CD positivity by immunohistochemistry or cytosol CD concentration. The correlation between CD expression in tumor cells of breast carcinoma by immunohistochemistry and cytosol CD positivity was not found either. However, there was a significant association between abundance of CD positive stromal macrophages and cytosol CD concentration in all histological tumor types (p < 0.05). CD positive macrophages were abundant in most of cytosol CD positive specimens. These results suggest that breast cancer cytosol CD concentration is the cumulative result of CD content in both carcinoma cells and stromal macrophages."

Using multivariate methods to examine predictors of survival, two clinical factors, pathologic nodal status and clinical stage of disease, were significantly associated with survival. In addition we found significant and independent effects on survival of: number of supportive friends, number of supportive persons, whether the woman worked, whether she was unmarried, the extent of contact with friends and the size of her social network. Thus, the woman's social context, particularly contexts of friendship and work outside the home, are statistically important for survival.

The Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) conducted the trial (DBCG-82TM) from January 1983 to March 1989 recruiting 1154 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Follow-up time ended 1(st) May 2006 with a median follow-up time of 19.6 years (time span 17.1-23.3 years). Eligibility criteria included a one-sided, unifocal, primary operable breast carcinoma, patient age below 70 years, probability of satisfactory cosmetic outcome with BCS, and no evidence of disseminated disease. The patients accrued were grouped into three subsets: correctly randomized, suspicion of randomization error, and declining randomization. The main analyses focus on the subgroup of 793 correctly randomized patients representing 70% of the complete series. 10-year recurrence free survival (RFS) and 20-year overall survival (OS) based on intent to treat did not reveal significant differences in outcome between breast conserving surgery vs. mastectomy, p=0.95 and p=0.10, respectively. Including the complete series comprising 1133 eligible patients based on treatment in fact given similarly no significant difference between surgical options could be traced in outcome of 10-year RFS and 20-year OS, p=0.94 and p=0.24, respectively. The pattern of recurrences as a first event in breast conservation vs. mastectomy did not differ significantly irrespective of site, p=0.27. Looking into the type of local relapse, viz., new primaries vs. true recurrences, it appeared that new primaries were significantly associated to BCS, while true recurrences dominated among M treated patients (p<0.001). In conclusion, long-term data indicate that BCS in eligible patients proves as effective as mastectomy both regarding local tumour control, RFS and OS. Local failures as a first event consistent with new primaries are strongly associated with BCS, whereas true recurrence predominates after mastectomy."

Both are related to pregnancy and have an estrogen-receptor protein. Lesions of the central nervous system following the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer are usually presumed to be metastatic. Therefore, these lesions may be irradiated without complete clinical investigation. If the clinician is aware of this association, appropriate diagnostic procedures could lead to the surgical removal of a benign meningioma.

This hypothesis has been confirmed following a thorough analysis of the reported WES studies. Enriched biological process and protein-protein interaction networks resulted in the identification of four novel breast cancer candidate genes namely MMS19, DNAH3, POLK and KATB6.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this first WES application on Tunisian breast cancer patients, we highlighted the impact of next generation sequencing technologies in the identification of novel breast cancer candidate genes which may bring new insights into the biological mechanisms of breast carcinogenesis. Our findings showed that the breast cancer predisposition in non-BRCA families may be ethnic and/or family specific."

For White women only, this risk was statistically significant and increased almost linearly within each TNM stage with grade dedifferentiation. The statistically significantly higher prevalence of \"ER(-)/PR(-), HER2(- )\" phenotype in African American women potentially is the attributing factor to observed lack of an association between the risk of HER2/neu positive breast carcinoma with advanced stages and poorly differentiated grade. Among women diagnosed with \"ER(-)/PR(-), HER2(-)\" phenotype the odds ratios of being African-American and pre-menopausal was 1.72 (95% CI 1.17-2.54, P = 0.006) and 1.94 (95% CI 1.27-2.96, P = 0.002), respectively. The histologic features of basal-like and ER(-)/HER2(+ )carcinomas overlaps. Differences in the biology of breast carcinoma between African American and White women are partially attributed to the disparity in more adverse pathologic prognostic indicators at the initial clinical presentation of this disease."

            "abstract": "A series of 346 patients with primary operable breast cancer and a series of 145 patients with advanced breast cancer were investigated for c-erbB-3 protein expression using the monoclonal antibody RTJ1. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour samples were stained using a standard immunochemical method and staining was assessed on a four-point scale. The study aimed to observe the expression of the c-erbB-3 protein and investigate any relationship between expression and established prognostic indicators and prognosis. In both the primary and advanced series breast tumour tissue was found to stain heterogeneously for c-erbB-3. The staining was observed to be predominantly cytoplasmic and the majority of tumours exhibited moderate positivity. However, 15% and 35% of cases in the primary operable and advanced series respectively displayed strong positive staining. No significant difference was found between the staining in the primary and advanced series. In the primary operable breast cancers, no significant associations were demonstrated with overall survival, disease-free interval, regional recurrence, the presence of distant metastases, age, menopausal status, oestrogen receptor status, histological grade, lymph node stage, vascular invasion and c-erbB-2 protein expression. However, a significant association was seen between the degree of c-erbB-3 immunoreactivity and both tumour size (P < 0.01) and tumour type prognostic group (P = 0.05). No overall association with local recurrence was seen when the four groups of c-erbB-3 expression were analysed (P = 0.12), but when those tumours showing no or weak staining were compared with those showing moderate and strong immunoreactivity it was seen that the latter were significantly more likely to develop local recurrence (P = 0.03). In the series of patients with advanced disease, no significant associations were demonstrated with survival, UICC criteria, age, menopausal status, oestrogen receptor status, histological grade, c-erbB-2 status or the presence of vascular invasion. In conclusion this study found variable expression of c-erbB-3 protein in human breast carcinoma and an association with some recognised prognostic factors in those patients with primary operable breast carcinoma. It seems, however, unlikely that c-erbB-3 protein expression will emerge as a powerful enough prognostic factor to be of value in clinical practice."

Sixty-nine breast cancer cases diagnosed at or before the age of 35 were analyzed for common morphological and immunophenotypical features of basal-like carcinomas. Sixteen carcinomas displayed the immunophenotypical characteristics (estrogen receptor and HER2 negativity and positivity for at least one of the following basal markers: cytokeratin 5 or 14, epidermal growth factor receptor, p63) of basal-like carcinomas, and most of them demonstrated characteristic histological features (pushing borders, lymphocytic peritumoral infiltrate, central hypocellular zone or necrosis, high mitotic rate) too. These tumors were more likely to be high-molecular-weight cytokeratin: 34betaE12 and p53 positive by immunohistochemistry. The presence of a basal-like phenotype can be important as concerns systemic treatment issues and could theoretically be associated with a higher rate of BRCA1 mutations in the young, because of the overlap of BRCA1 mutation associated breast carcinomas and the basal-like phenotype."

However, these factors are of little help when deciding against adjuvant chemo-/hormonotherapy. Therefore, there is a need to search for additional factors which modify the prognosis in breast cancer patients. The aim of this study was to determine associations of the proliferation index (PI) with some clinical and anatomical factors, as well as with the overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMS) rates in invasive ductal breast cancer.

High PI correlated with young age of patient, tumor diameter, high histological malignancy score, absence of estrogen receptor in cells, and metastases to axillary lymph nodes. The frequency of distant metastases and high mortality risk correlated with high PI in the whole group and in subgroups without or with metastases to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes, with grade II cancers according to the B-R score, and with the presence of estrogen receptors in the tumor. PI proved to be an independent prognostic factor in the whole group and in the subgroup of patients with axillary node metastases.

PI can be used to identify patients with a worse prognosis among patients with metastases to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes or with grade II cancer according to the Bloom-Richardson score.

Absence of stromal caveolin-1 expression was detected in 18.7% of cases, while 25.3% of cases revealed tumor epithelial caveolin-1 expression. Combined stromal and tumor caveolin-1 immunopositivity was seen in 24.2% of cases. Absence of stromal cav-1 associated with larger tumor size, higher grade, higher nodal stage, higher number of positive nodes, higher TNM stage, positive HER2 status, higher recurrence rate, and shorter mean progression free survival (PFS). Stromal cav-1 status was a significant predictor of PFS in ER+, PR +, and HER2 + tumors. In tamoxifen-treated patients, absence of stromal Cav-1 was a significant predictor of poor clinical outcome, suggestive of tamoxifen resistance. Conversely, tumor epithelial and combined caveolin-1 expression, didnot associate with patient outcome. In multivariate analysis, only TNM stage independently associated with survival. Loss of stromal caveolin-1 is a novel breast cancer biomarker that can predict early tumor recurrence, short PFS, and tamoxifen- resistance. Thus, its use as a predictive biomarker, especially in lower grade, lower stage, ER+, PR+, HER2+, and tamoxifen treated patients may allow for early interventions with more aggressive therapies. Thus, stromal marker expression and epithelial-stromal cross talk may be critical for tumor progression and metastasis."

However, its precise role in breast cancer of Saudi women has not been evaluated in any published study. We investigated fascin-1 and paxillin expression in breast carcinoma, and we have related these results to the established prognostic factors. We studied 100 breast carcinoma specimens. Immunohistochemical analyses for fascin-1 and paxillin were conducted on paraffin sections of breast tissues using the avidin-biotin peroxidase method.

Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between fascin-1 expression with paxillin immunostaining but no such association with PR or ER status.

Structured interviews were conducted with 113 women who had received a diagnosis of breast cancer within the previous year. We found that satisfaction with the partner helping relationship was associated with psychological well-being. Even though most women had a good helping relationship with another person, this did not compensate for a problematic helping relationship with the partner. Good communication with the partner was characterized by high empathy and low withdrawal.

Estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor status was determined immunohistochemically. The proliferative activity of the tumours was assessed by Ki-67 antigen labelling. Total observation time was 3.5 years.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      DNA ploidy analysis revealed a high fraction of tumours with non-peridiploid patterns (78%). Significant correlations between DNA ploidy and ER/PR receptor status (P < 0.01) were found with increased frequencies of peridiploid DNA results in receptor positive tumours. A significant relationship became manifest between DNA ploidy and Ki-67 index showing high frequencies of non-peridiploid DNA patterns in tumours with Ki-67 index > 20% (P < 0.01). There was a strong correlation (P < 0.001) between DNA ploidy and histopathologic grading, while tumour size and lymph node status were not correlated to DNA ploidy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results of our study on invasive breast carcinoma demonstrate that DNA ploidy measured by image analysis is predominantly associated with markers of cell differentiation.

            "abstract": "Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier proteins (or SUMO) modify the function of protein substrates involved in various cellular processes including DNA damage response (DDR). It is becoming apparent that dysregulated SUMO contribute to carcinogenesis by affecting post-transcriptional modification of key proteins. It is hypothesised that SUMO contributes to the aggressive nature of breast cancer particularly those associated with features similar to breast carcinoma arising in patients with BRCA1 germline mutations. This study aims to assess the clinical and biological significance of three members of SUMO in a well-characterised annotated series of BC with emphasis on DDR. The study cohort comprised primary operable invasive BC including tumours from patients with known BRCA1 germline mutations. SUMO proteins PIAS1, PIAS4 and UBC9 were assessed using immunohistochemistry utilising tissue microarray technology. Additionally, their expression was assessed using reverse phase protein microarray utilising different cell lines. PIAS1 and UBC9 showed cytoplasmic and/or nuclear expression while PIAS4 was detected only in the nuclei. There was a correlation between subcellular localisation and expression of the nuclear transport protein KPNA2. Tumours showing positive nuclear/negative cytoplasmic expression of SUMO featured good prognostic characteristics including lower histologic grade and had a good outcome. Strong correlation with DDR-related proteins including BRCA1, Rad51, ATM, CHK1, DNA-PK and KU70/KU80 was observed. Correlation with ER and BRCA1 was confirmed using RPPA on cell lines. SUMO proteins seem to play important role in BC. Not only expression but also subcellular location is associated with BC phenotype."

The MIB1 labelling index was studied using a CAS 200 image analyser in 177 tumours from women with primary operable breast carcinoma in whom long-term follow-up data were known. Statistical analysis showed a strong association between the MIB1 labelling index and histological grade (P < 0.001), tumour size (P = 0.002), tumour type (P < 0.001) and also patient survival (P < 0.001). No association with lymph node stage (P = 0.974) or regional recurrence (P = 0.185), the presence or absence of distant metastases (P = 0.418), patient age (P = 0.309), menopausal status (P = 0.181) or oestrogen receptor status (P = 0.401) was found in this group of patients. In multivariate analysis for survival, when histological grade, lymph node stage and tumour size were included as well as the MIB1 labelling index, each was found to be of independent significance. If histological grade was not included, MIB1 replaced it as the most important variable predicting for survival in this group of patients. The results suggest that the tumour growth fraction, as assessed by the MIB1 labelling index, is an important predictor of survival."

However, little is known about the FGF8 expression profile in human breast cancer specimens. In this study, we analyzed FGF8 expression in 78 surgically resected specimens of breast cancer using an immunohistochemical method. In total, FGF8 expression was found in 40 (51.3%) of the breast carcinomas. FGF8 expression was not associated with any of the general clinicopathological parameters, including age, tumor size, histological grade, and histological type. In addition, there was no correlation between FGF8 expression and either c-erbB-2 overexpression or the status of the axillary lymph-node metastasis, both of which have been established as important prognostic factors in breast carcinomas. While no significant association was found between FGF8 expression and estrogen- or progesterone-receptor status, it is of interest that FGF8 expression was significantly associated with androgen-receptor status and the expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), one of the androgen-regulated proteins, in human breast carcinomas. These associations support the reported in vitro data demonstrating the regulation of FGF8 by androgens, and also suggest that PSA may be a useful marker for patients with FGF8-expressing breast carcinomas."

Unfortunately, research has been hampered by lack of measures suitable for use in oncology settings. This study examined the performance of one recently developed measure, the Santa Clara Strength of Religious Faith Questionnaire (SCSORF). Initial investigations with cancer patients in a bone marrow transplant program and with non-oncology patients yielded promising results. This study provided additional information about temporal stability and convergent validity. The measure was evaluated in two well-defined samples: (1) 95 breast cancer patients, and (2) 53 healthy young adults. Most of the cancer patients had recent diagnoses and localized or regional disease. In each sample, the instrument demonstrated high test-retest reliability (r's=0.82-0.93) and internal consistency (r's=0.95-0.97). It displayed strong correlations with measures of intrinsic religiosity (r's=0.67-0.82, p<0.0001), and moderate correlations with organizational religiosity (r's=0.61-069, p<0.0001), non-organizational religiosity (r's=0.52-0.55, p<0.0001), comfort from religion (r=0.58, p<0.0001), and ratings of self as religious (r=0.58, p<0.0001). Among cancer patients, scores were significantly associated with optimism (r=0.30, p<0.01), but not with openness of family communication about cancer or perceived social support. These data build on previous findings with cancer patients, and suggest that the SCSORF may be a useful measure of religious faith in oncology settings."

To expand on previous studies, we have investigated the associations of tumor cell expression of HLA-DR and its related co-chaperones, invariant chain (Ii) and HLA-DM, with infiltrating inflammatory cells, in situ cytokine mRNA levels and prognosis and outcome in 112 breast carcinoma patients with a median follow-up of 59 months. While the majority of HLA-DR+ tumors co-express Ii, only a minority express HLA-DM. Tumor cell expression of HLA-DR and co-chaperones positively associated with both infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets (P < 0.01). Expression of HLA-DR and Ii associated with decreased estrogen receptor alpha levels and younger age at diagnosis, suggesting a role for hormones in the control of HLA class II expression in breast carcinoma. Patients with DR+Ii+DM- tumors had markedly decreased recurrence-free and disease-specific survival as compared with patients with DR+Ii+DM+ tumors (P < 0.05) and HLA-DR/co-chaperone expression was an independent predictor of survival by multivariate Cox regression analysis, controlling for standard prognostic indicators. Tumors that co-express HLA-DR, Ii and HLA-DM have increased levels of IFN-gamma, IL-2 and IL-12 mRNA, suggesting improved survival of patients with DR+Ii+DM+ tumors may be attributable to Th1-dominated immunity. We conclude that expression of determinants of the immune response by tumor cells may influence breast tumor progression and patient outcome."

We stained 27 breast specimens harboring abundant LCIS with antibodies to smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, smooth muscle actin, and calponin. Dual stains for E-cadherin/smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and CK7/p63 were also performed. In each case, the intensity and distribution of staining in LCIS-associated myoepithelial cells were compared with normal breast tissue on the same slide. In 78% of the cases, LCIS-associated myoepithelial cells demonstrated decreased staining intensity for one or more myoepithelial markers. The normal localization of myoepithelial cells (flat against the basement membrane, pattern N) was seen in 96% of LCIS, yet 85% of cases had areas with myoepithelial cell cytoplasm oriented perpendicular to the basement membrane (pattern P), and in 30% of cases, myoepithelial cells appeared focally admixed with LCIS cells (pattern C). This study characterizes detailed architectural and immunophenotypic alterations of LCIS-associated myoepithelial cells. The finding of variably diminished staining favors application of several myoepithelial immunostains in clinical practice. The interaction of LCIS with myoepithelial cells, especially in light of the perpendicular and central architectural arrangements, deserves further mechanistic investigation."

The highest CA IX immunostaining scores were found in the fibroblasts of large FF occupying more than one-third of the tumor. A large FF was associated with worse overall survival in a consecutive patient group (p = 0.01) and with shorter disease-free (p = 0.02) and overall survival (p = 0.0005) in T1-2N0 breast cancer patients. The strong association of CA IX expression with the presence of an FF shows that the latter is a marker of intra-tumoral hypoxia.

The stromal reaction patterns in ductal breast carcinoma are known to be morphologically varied. This has raised the hypothesis that there might be a differential expression of the lysyl oxidase gene as a function of stromal reaction pattern. The present study investigates this potential correlation and the role of matrix protein cross-linking in stromal differentiation. Lysyl oxidase was detected by immunohistochemistry and lysyl oxidase gene expression by in situ hybridization. Maximal expression was observed in myofibroblasts and myoepithelial cells around in situ tumors and in the reactive fibrosis facing the invasion front of infiltrating tumors. The lysyl oxidase substrates were observed in parallel, resulting in the stabilization of a scar-like peritumor barrier. In contrast, a lack of lysyl oxidase was associated with the loose or scirrhous stroma accompanying invading tumors; here, in situ hybridization revealed type I collagen synthesis, resulting in the deposition of non-cross-linked matrix proteins susceptible to degradation. The early development of a cross-linked matrix around ductal breast carcinoma suggests a possible bost defense mechanism, whereas the synchronous or late stromal reaction lacking lysyl oxidase favors tumor dispersion."

Thus, we first conducted interviews among 28 breast cancer patients to identify these support items assessed as negative; next, we conducted a questionnaire survey using the resulting items in 109 postoperative patients who had early-stage breast cancer. We performed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and obtained a valid second-order factor structure, including superordinate factors (excessive engagement, avoidance of problems and underestimation) and subordinate factors (overprotection, encouragement and management). Among these factors, the avoidance of problems was the only factor to be negatively associated with psychological adjustment of the patients, suggesting that these patients receive problem-avoiding support.

The SEER database from 1973 to 1994 was utilized to calculate age specific and calendar year specific incidence rates for each year for thyroid and breast carcinomas. The expected number of second cancers for each age group, calendar year, and follow-up period were determined by multiplying these incidence rates by the age specific and calendar year specific number of person-years at risk. The risk ratio (RR) was calculated by dividing the observed by the expected number of second cancers. Statistical significance was determined by the Poisson test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 1,333,115 person-years were available for analysis. One hundred thirteen thyroid carcinoma cases were diagnosed after breast carcinoma cases (RR, 0.99; P = 0.576). Two hundred fifty-two breast carcinoma cases were diagnosed after thyroid carcinoma cases (RR, 1.18; P = 0.007). Premenopausal women (age 20-49 years) with an index thyroid carcinoma have a significantly increased risk of developing subsequent breast carcinoma (RR, 1.42; P = 0.001). Black premenopausal women with an index thyroid carcinoma do not have an increased risk of developing breast carcinoma, but the statistical power is lower due to low numbers. No women with index breast carcinoma have an increased risk of developing thyroid carcinoma.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Women with a history of thyroid carcinoma have a greater than expected risk of developing breast carcinoma. This risk is most pronounced in premenopausal white women. The implications of this observation with respect to breast carcinoma screening guidelines and thyroid carcinoma treatment guidelines deserve further investigation."

            "abstract": "The ANPEP, AZGP1, and SPDEF genes were previously found to be overexpressed in breast compared to ovarian carcinoma effusions. The present study validated this finding in a larger cohort consisting of both primary and metastatic tumors. ANPEP, AZGP1, and SPDEF mRNA expression was investigated in 83 breast carcinomas (57 primary carcinomas and 26 effusions) and 40 ovarian carcinomas (20 primary carcinomas and 20 effusions) using qPCR. ANPEP protein expression was immunohistochemically analyzed in 53 breast carcinoma effusions and patient-matched primary carcinomas (n = 25) and lymph node metastases (n = 16). mRNA and protein levels were studied for association with tumor type and anatomic site, and for clinical role in breast carcinoma. AZGP1 and SPDEF mRNA was overexpressed in breast compared to ovarian carcinoma (both p < 0.001). AZGP1 mRNA was overexpressed in primary breast carcinoma compared to effusions (p < 0.001), with opposite findings for ANPEP (p = 0.044). AZGP1 mRNA expression correlated with positive ER status (p = 0.032) and grade 1 histology (p = 0.011), whereas SPDEF mRNA levels were associated with positive ER (p = 0.002) and PR (p = 0.013) status and tamoxifen treatment (p = 0.004). ANPEP protein expression was higher in breast carcinoma effusions compared to primary tumors and lymph node metastases (both p = 0.001). ANPEP, AZGP1, and SPDEF levels were unrelated to disease-free or overall survival. This is the first study documenting ANPEP, AZGP1, and SPDEF expression in breast carcinoma effusions. AZGP1 and SPDEF may be novel molecular markers for the differentiation of breast from ovarian carcinoma. ANPEP may be involved in breast carcinoma progression in view of its overexpression in effusions compared to solid specimens."

            "abstract": "Background Metastatic progression of breast cancer is still a challenge in clinical oncology. Therefore, an elucidation how carcinoma cells belonging to different breast cancer subtypes realize their metastatic capacities is needed. The aim of this study was to elucidate a similarity of activated molecular pathways underlying an enhancement of invasiveness of carcinoma cells belonging to different breast carcinoma subtypes. Materials and methods In order to reach this aim, parental and invasive (INV) MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative), T47D (hormone receptor-positive), and Au565 (Her2-positive) breast carcinoma cells were used and their molecular phenotypes were compared using a proteomic approach. Results Independently from breast cancer subtypes, INV cells have demonstrated fibroblast-like morphology accompanied by enhancement of invasive and migratory capacities, increased expression of cancer stem cell markers, and delayed tumor growth in in vivo animal models. However, the global proteomic analysis has highlighted that INV cells were different in protein expressions from the parental cells, and Her2-positive Au565-INV cells showed the most pronounced molecular differences compared to the triple-negative MDA-MB-231-INV and hormone receptor-positive T47D-INV cells. Although Au565-INV breast carcinoma cells possessed the highest number of deregulated proteins, they had the lowest overlapping in proteins commonly expressed in MDA-MB-231-INV and T47D-INV cells. Conclusions We can conclude that hormone receptor-positive cells with increased invasiveness acquire the molecular characteristics of triple-negative breast cancer cells, whereas Her2-positive INV cells specifically changed their own molecular phenotype with very limited partaking in the involved pathways found in the MDA-MB-231-INV and T47D-INV cells. Since hormone receptor-positive invasive cells share their molecular properties with triple-negative breast cancer cells, we assume that these types of metastatic disease can be treated rather equally with an option to add anti-hormonal agents. In contrast, Her2-positive metastasis should be carefully evaluated for more effective therapeutic approaches which are distinct from the triple-negative and hormone-positive metastatic breast cancers."

            "abstract": "Steroid hormones bind to their receptors and trans-activate target genes. Rapid non-genomic action of steroid hormones has been proposed in addition to the one at the genomic level. Estrogen has been described to activate c-Src kinase and this activation has been shown to be responsible for estrogen-dependent mitogenicity. A major substrate of c-Src kinase activity is the cytoskeletal protein p130Cas, originally identified in v-Src-transformed cells. We show that in the human breast carcinoma T47D cells, upon estrogen treatment, p130Cas rapidly and transiently associates with the estrogen receptor alpha in a multi-molecular complex containing the c-Src kinase and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. Association of p130Cas with the estrogen receptor alpha occurs within 3 minutes of estrogen treatment and is dependent on c-Src kinase activation. Transient overexpression of p130Cas in T47D cells increases estrogen-dependent Src kinase and Erk1/2 MAPKs activities and accelerates their kinetics of stimulation. A similar effect was detected on estrogen-dependent cyclin D1 expression, suggesting a role for p130Cas in regulating estrogen-dependent cell cycle progression. Double-stranded small RNA interference (siRNA) by silencing endogenous p130Cas protein, was sufficient to inhibit estrogen-dependent Erk1/2 MAPKs activity and cyclin D1 induction, demonstrating the requirement of p130Cas in such events. Therefore, our data show that the adaptor protein p130Cas associates with the estrogen receptor transducing complex, regulating estrogen-dependent activation of c-Src kinase and downstream signaling pathways."

We investigated the association between recreational and occupational physical activity and breast cancer risk in a population-based case-control study in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin. During structured telephone interviews, 7,630 controls, 1,689 in situ, and 6,391 invasive breast cancer cases, ages 20 to 69 years, reported lifetime history of recreational physical activity and occupation. Neither lifetime recreational nor strenuous occupational physical activity appeared to be associated with risk of breast carcinoma in situ. In contrast, recreational physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of invasive breast cancer. After adjustment for potentially confounding factors, women averaging >6 h per week of strenuous recreational activity over their lifetime had a 23% reduction in the odds ratio of invasive breast cancer when compared with women reporting no recreational activity (95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.92; P(trend) = 0.05). However, this reduction in risk was limited to women without a first-degree family history of breast cancer (P(interaction) = 0.02). Inverse associations were observed for physical activity early in life, in the postmenopausal years, and in the recent past, but these findings were confined to women without a family history of breast cancer. Lifetime strenuous occupational activity was not associated with invasive breast cancer risk. These results provide further evidence that, for most women, physical activity may reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer."

We aimed to investigate whether local inflammation in the breast tissue is associated with age-related lobular involution, a process inversely related to breast cancer risk. Levels of eleven pro- and anti-inflammatory markers were assessed by immunohistochemistry in normal breast tissue obtained from 164 pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer patients. Involution status of the breast (degree of lobular involution and the predominant lobule type) was microscopically assessed in normal breast tissue on hematoxylin-eosin stained mastectomy slides. Multivariate generalized linear models were used to assess the associations. In age-adjusted analyses, higher levels of pro-inflammatory markers IL-6, TNF-α, CRP, COX-2, leptin, SAA1 and IL-8; and anti-inflammatory marker IL-10, were inversely associated with the prevalence of complete lobular involution (all P≤0.04). Higher levels of the pro-inflammatory marker COX-2 were also associated with lower prevalence of predominant type 1/no type 3 lobules in the breast, an indicator of complete involution, in age-adjusted analysis (P = 0.017). Higher tissue levels of inflammatory markers, mainly the pro-inflammatory ones, are associated with less involuted breasts and may consequently be associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer."

Germ-line mutations in breast carcinoma susceptibility genes, particularly BRCA2, are associated with an increased risk of male breast carcinoma. The authors sought to correlate significant family history with clinical phenotype in males with breast carcinoma.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      One hundred forty-two men with breast carcinoma were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center or the Ochsner Clinic from 1973 to 1994. The authors reviewed the effect imparted by a family history of breast carcinoma on the duration of symptoms, the age at diagnosis, and the survival of men with this disease.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Fifteen percent of male breast carcinoma patients had a first-degree relative with the disease. Fifty-eight years was the mean age at diagnosis for those with a family history, compared with 61 years for those without (P = not significant [NS]). The mean duration of symptoms was 23 months for those with a family history, compared with 22 months for those without. Three of 22 patients (13.6%) with a family history, compared with 11 of 90 patients (12%) without a family history, had Stage III disease (P = NS) at presentation. The overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 86% and 64%. Survival was not affected by family history. Lymph node positivity reduced 5-year and 10-year survival rates to 73% and 50% (P = 0.0004).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      For men with breast carcinoma, the presence of a family history did not affect the age at presentation, the duration of symptoms, the stage of disease at presentation, or the overall survival. In multivariate analysis, the most powerful predictor of outcome for these men was the status of the axillary lymph nodes."

Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling were used to assess the overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and local relapse cumulative incidence, according to the presence or absence of FOXP3 expression.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      FOXP3 expression in tumors was associated with worse overall survival probability and the risk increased with increasing FOXP3 immunostaining intensity. FOXP3 was also a strong prognostic factor for distant metastases-free survival but not for local recurrence risk. In multivariate analysis FOXP3 resulted an independent prognostic factor and the hazard ratio of FOXP3 expression and of lymph node positivity were similar. In the Milan 3 trial, the probability of 10-year survival in node-negative subgroup was 100% for FOXP3-negative and 82% for FOXP3-positive patients; in node-positive subgroup 82% for FOXP3-negative and 41% for FOXP3-positive patients.

Histology specimens were reviewed and classified according to type, nodal status, tumor size and grade. Steroid hormone receptors were assayed by biochemical methods according to the procedures recommended by the EORTC. pS2 protein measurement was performed in breast carcinoma cytosols using an immunoradiometric assay.

The expression of pS2 protein was confirmed to be correlated with steroid hormone receptor status. However, it is important to point out that in spite of these statistically significant findings there were no significant biological associations due to overlapping individual pS2 protein values. The baseline level of expression of pS2 protein was obtained in histological grade III carcinomas with a negative steroid hormone receptor status. It was shown that the distribution of carcinomas according to the baseline level of pS2 protein expression was heterogeneous among estrogen receptor-positive carcinomas, and strikingly homogeneous among estrogen and progesterone-negative carcinoma.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our study suggested that PR and pS2 protein may identify distinct subsets of estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinomas."

The Lewisy and Lewisb antigens are complex carbohydrates that are over-expressed by breast, lung, colon and ovarian cancers. The SC101 mAb is a unique Lewisy/b binding antibody that binds to native and extended Lewisy and Lewisb haptens, displaying no cross reactivity with H type 1, H type 2, Lewisx or normal blood group antigens.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Immunohistochemical detection of Lewisy/b was performed on 660 formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded breast tumour specimens using a streptavidin-biotin peroxidase technique.

A potential predictive factor, topoisomerase IIalpha, is a target for certain cytotoxic drugs, and its concentration has been shown to correlate with chemosensitivity in vitro. We evaluated expression of topo IIalpha immunohistochemically in 230 breast cancer samples and studied its association with known clinicopathological factors and factors previously shown to predict response to cytotoxic drugs. Topo IIalpha protein expression was found in 0.6 to 39.4% (10.6 +/- 7.9%, mean +/- SD) of breast carcinoma cells, whereas expression was undetectable in nonmalignant breast epithelium. Topo IIalpha protein expression correlated well with semi-quantitative mRNA in situ hybridization (P = 0.007). A significant association was found between the proportion of topo-IIalpha-positive cells and low estrogen and progesterone receptor content (P<0.0001), high grade (P<0.0001), DNA aneuploidy (P=0.003), and c-erbB-2 oncoprotein overexpression (P<0.0001). Topo IIalpha expression was not associated with clinical variables, such as age of the patient, primary tumor size, or axillary nodal status. A highly significant linear correlation was found between topo IIalpha and tumor proliferation rate (S-phase fraction, r=0.46; P<0.0001). Because hormone receptors, grade, and ploidy are associated with tumor proliferation rate, topo IIalpha expression was adjusted for S-phase fraction to reveal the proliferation-independent clinopathological associations. According to the analysis of co-variance, only aneuploidy (P=0.0003) and c-erb-2 overexpression (P=0.01) were associated with proliferation-adjusted expression of topo IIalpha. In conclusion, the close association of Topo IIalpha with other potential predictive factors (tumor proliferation rate, c-erbB-2 oncoprotein) suggests that topo IIalpha, having a defined role as a target for cytotoxic drugs, may be a valuable predictor of response to chemotherapy."

However, there have been few studies on S100A9 in adenocarcinoma (AC) because the expression in normal epithelia is limited to squamous epithelia. Our previous studies on pulmonary AC and liver carcinomas suggested that S100A9 expression in carcinomas of glandular cell origin is related to poor tumour differentiation. In this study, we examined S100A9 expression in invasive breast carcinoma and evaluated the relation of the expression to the tumour differentiation in 70 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast. S100A9 gene and protein expression was detected in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. The rate of S100A9 immunopositivity in IDC showed a higher correlation with poor tumour differentiation, especially in nuclear pleomorphism (P=0.0002) and mitotic activity (P=0.0001). Furthermore, transcriptional expression of S100A9 in sections of IDC could be detected in cases with a high S100A9 immunopositivity. No significant differences in the number of myelomonocytic cells expressing S100A9 were found among cases. There was no correlation between S100A9 immunopositivity and lymph node metastasis (P=0.32). S100A9 immunopositivity in non-invasive ductal carcinoma was also associated with poor tumour differentiation. No immunopositive reaction was observed in invasive lobular carcinomas with a classic cytological appearance and non-neoplastic duct cells.

Luminal A carcinomas had the highest frequency for GATA-3 (140/245), however basal-like carcinomas had the lowest (1/42) (p<0.0001). None of the medullary and metaplastic carcinomas expressed GATA3. GATA3 was associated with good DFS and OS (p=0.001 and p=0.0009) and was an independent prognostic factor for OS. GATA3 expression, regardless of the subtype, may have a prognostic significance for breast carcinomas through its ability to promote the differentiation of luminal progenitor cells."

            "abstract": "The insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF1R) is involved in progression of breast cancer and resistance to systemic treatment. Targeting IGF1R signaling may, therefore, be beneficial in systemic treatment. We report the effect of IGF1R expression on prognosis in invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDC), the most common type of breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tumor tissue of a consecutive cohort of 429 female patients treated for operable primary IDC. Associations between IGF1R expression with clinicopathological parameters, disease free survival (DFS) and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) were evaluated by multivariate analyses focusing on ER-positive and triple negative IDC (TN-IDC). To enlarge the TN-IDCs cohort, we analyzed a combined dataset of 51 TN-IDC tumors from our series with 64 TN-IDCs with similar clinicopathological parameters. Patients with tumors expressing cytoplasmic IGF1R have a longer DFS and BCSS (DFS: HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27-0.49, P = 0.005, BCSS: HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19-0.74, P = 0.005). This effect was most prominent in ER-positive tumors. However, in a combined series of 105 TN-IDCs cytoplasmic IGF1R expression was associated with a shorter DFS (HR = 2.29, 95% CI 1.08-4.84, P = 0.03), also when combined in a multivariate model, including well-known prognostic factors (HR 2.06; 95% CI 0.95-4.47; P = 0.07). IGF1R expression in ER-positive IDC is strongly related to a favorable DFS and BCSS, but to a shorter DFS in TN-IDC tumors. This divergent effect of IGF1R expression in subgroups of IDC may affect selection of patients for IGF1R targeted therapy."

            "abstract": "The antiapoptotic protein survivin is widely expressed in most human cancers, including carcinomas of the breast. It is rarely detected in corresponding normal adult tissues. Therefore, survivin comes into the limelight as a promising diagnostic biomarker and prognostic parameter. Immunohistochemically, we examined the expression of this protein in 126 cases of ductal breast carcinoma to determine the association with clinicomorphological parameters such as age of patients, grade, stage and size of the primary tumor, lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion as well as estrogen and progesterone status. In each section, the subcellular location of survivin antigen, the intensity of staining and the percentage of labeled cells were assessed. Overall, survivin was expressed in 111 cases (88.1%). The statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between the nuclear location of survivin and tumor grade 3. Furthermore, a significant relation was also found between vascular invasion and nuclear and combined nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin expression, together with a higher intensity of immunoreaction. However, no significant correlations were shown with other clinicomorphological parameters, such as stage and size of the tumor, lymph node metastasis, estrogen and progesterone receptors and age. Our findings revealed that survivin was frequently overexpressed in carcinoma cells, where it was present in different subcellular compartments. The nuclear positivity of survivin or combined nuclear and cytoplasmic expression was shown to be a poor prognostic parameter in ductal breast carcinoma."

Our aim was to determine the prevalence of the 21 BRCA1/2 mutations in Finnish ovarian carcinoma families.

In one family, a novel, apparently disease-causing missense mutation in the BRCA2 gene had been identified previously. Thus, 26% of the Finnish ovarian carcinoma families were found to be BRCA1/2 mutation-positive. Strong ovarian cancer family history and early-onset breast cancer were strongly associated with BRCA1/2 mutation status; all families with three ovarian carcinoma cases or early-onset breast cancer (<50 years) were mutation-positive, whereas all families with later-onset breast cancer as well as the majority (9/11) of the site-specific ovarian carcinoma families with minor ovarian cancer history (i.e. two affected cases) remained mutation-negative."

The expression of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 was determined immunohistochemically. Pathological response was determined in 318 patients. Pathological complete response (pCR) was observed in 18% of patients. The pCR rate was significantly higher in patients treated with DD regimen (22 vs. 13%) and younger than 55 years (23 vs. 13%). The pCR rate was higher in patients with triple negative (TN) tumors (43%) and tumors over-expressing HER-2 (HER-2+; 28%) compared to patients with ER- or PR-positive tumors not expressing HER-2 (ER/PR+HER-2-; 6%). In patients with TN tumors pCR rate was significantly higher after treatment with DD AC-P compared to AT (61 vs. 22%, p=0.005). pCR was associated with significantly improved relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), but when analysis was performed based on tumor phenotype, the difference was significant only in patients with TN tumors. In multivariate analysis, pCR, stage, and ER expression were significant predictors of RFS, while pCR, stage, ER and DD regimen were significant predictors of OS. In conclusion, present data indicate superiority of a DD regimen in obtaining pCR in patients with breast carcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The difference in efficacy is due mostly to markedly higher pCR rate in patients with TN tumors."

            "abstract": "Genetic alterations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene with or without protein overexpression have been reported to be associated with sporadic breast cancer. To assess the role of p53 in infiltrative ductal breast carcinoma among Iranian patients, p53 protein expression and p53 gene mutations were studied by immunohistochemical analysis and single-strand conformation polymorphism, respectively. The p53 protein was expressed in 25 out of 51 (49%) tumors and p53 gene mutations were detected in 17 out of 37 (46%) tested tumors. No significant correlation was observed between p53 gene mutations and p53 protein expression. There was no significant correlation between p53 abnormalities (mutation and expression) and tumor size, histological grade, nodal status, and progesterone receptor expression. However, a non-statistically significant trend of association (P=0.07) was observed between p53 gene mutations and lack of estrogen receptor. The high percentage of alterations both in p53 gene and protein among southern Iranian breast cancer patients suggests that p53 is probably one of the genes involved in sporadic breast cancer in this area."

Previous studies on the prognostic value of fascin and MMP-9 in breast carcinoma revealed conflicting results. To date, no immunohistochemical studies have been performed to assess the possible association between them in breast carcinoma. This study is designed to correlate their expression with prognostic parameters in breast carcinoma and assess the relationship between them.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Immunohistochemical expression of fascin and MMP-9 was evaluated semi quantitatively in 67 cases of breast carcinoma regarding the percentage of positive cells. Chi square test and Fisher's exact test were used to examine the relationship between categorical variables.

Regarding the normal breast tissue, fascin expression was observed in myoepithelial cells and luminal cells of few ducts and acini. However, normal tissue showed negative MMP-9 expression. A significant relationship was observed between fascin and MMP-9 expression and lymph node metastases (p = 0.001 and 0.002 respectively), advanced tumor stage (p = 0.004 and 0.005 respectively), estrogen receptor negative (p = 0.002 and 0.005 respectively), progesterone receptor negative (p = 0.001 and 0.003 respectively) hormonal status and molecular subtypes (p = 0.0007 and 0.014 respectively). A significant strong agreement was detected between fascin and MMP-9 expression (p = 0.0001). More intense immunostaining of fascin and MMP-9 was observed at the invasive fronts compared with other areas of the tumor. Moreover, a significant moderate agreement between fascin and MMP-9 was found regarding the site of predominant intensity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Fascin and MMP-9 proteins are associated with parameters of poor prognosis in breast cancer.

            "abstract": "Tissue homeostasis and the maintenance of cell populations depend on a delicate balance between the rates of cell proliferation and cell death. Programmed cell death or apoptosis is believed to play a major role in physiological processes which, when defective, could contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of tumors. A role for altered programmed cell death in cancer stems from the description of alterations on tumor-associated genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis such as p53 and bcl-2. The p53 gene promotes apoptosis in cells with genetic damage, while bcl-2 is an antiapoptotic gene. It is therefore possible that the balance between p53 and bcl-2 may have significant implications for the pathobiology of breast cancer. This study was therefore undertaken to evaluate the expression of these two proteins with opposite functions and their relation to the total growth fraction of the tumor as measured by PCNA immunoreactivity. A significant correlation was observed between expression of p53 and PCNA. In contrast, bcl-2 expression did not correlate with the expression of p53. There was also no correlation observed between expression of bcl-2 and PCNA. A significant correlation was observed between expression of p53 and the grade of the tumor and stage of the disease. Our results thus support the hypothesis that accumulation of p53 is associated with a high tumor proliferation rate, an association that might be expected in view of the role of wild-type p53 as a negative regulator of cell proliferation. Another important observation was the lack of relationship between bcl-2 expression and PCNA immunoreactivity, supporting the hypothesis that bcl-2 is not a major regulator of proliferation."

Herein, we report the identification of several factors that associate with SETD6 and are implicated in nuclear hormone receptor signaling. Specifically, SETD6 associates with the estrogen receptor α (ERα), histone deacetylase HDAC1, metastasis protein MTA2, and the transcriptional co-activator TRRAP. Luciferase reporter assays identify SETD6 as a transcriptional repressor, in agreement with its association with HDAC1 and MTA2. However, SETD6 behaves as a co-activator of several estrogen-responsive genes, such as PGR and TFF1. Consistent with these results, silencing of SETD6 in several breast carcinoma cell lines induced cellular proliferation defects accompanied by enhanced expression of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1A and induction of apoptosis. Herein, we have identified several chromatin proteins that associate with SETD6 and described SETD6 as an essential factor for nuclear receptor signaling and cellular proliferation."

Furthermore, an increasing incidence of simultaneous cancers are currently observed (16,18).

It is well known that both uterus and breast are hormone-dependent organs and are likely to be influenced by the same oncogenic stimulus, either of endocrine nature or dietary origin (2, 3, 14). The risk of developing endometrial carcinoma is higher in patients already affected by breast neoplasm and is much more evident in older women within the first five years following the diagnosis of breast tumor. Conversely, patients with endometrial carcinoma may present a second mammary neoplasm and the relative risk is around 2.0 (1, 17). Although the existence of a correlation between these two primary malignant neoplasms is clearly observed, the absence of systematic studies directed to the screening of endometrial cancer in women with breast carcinoma is surprising.

EMT has received interest from cancer researchers due to its potential role in processes important in cancer progression and metastasis. Recent evidence has revealed a clear association between EMT and resistance to therapeutics. Targeting of EMT and/or the mesenchymal-like phenotype may be a promising avenue for future therapeutic intervention.

Expression of p63 was also significantly associated with histological grade 3 (11/20 (55%) vs 11/47 (23.4%); p=0.012) and negatively associated with grade 2 (9/20 (45%) vs 36/47 (76.6%); p=0.012). Intriguingly, p63-positive breast carcinomas showed significant aberrant p53 expression by immunohistochemistry (16/18 (88.9%) vs 29/47 (61.7%); p=0.03) and of TP53 mutation by Sanger sequencing (15/16 (93.8%) vs 12/22 (54.5%); p=0.009). No significant difference in tumour response after anti-HER2 neoadjuvant therapy nor in survival were found between p63-positive and p63-negative breast carcinomas.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Expression of p63 in HER2-positive breast carcinoma is significantly associated with younger age, poor differentiation, high histological grade and aberrant expression of p53 and of TP53 mutation. HER2-positive breast carcinoma with a myoepithelial immunophenotype shows distinctive clinicopathological features representing a distinct subtype of HER2-positive breast carcinoma. Further, these findings suggest an interaction between p63 and mutant p53 in the tumorigenesis of HER2-positive breast carcinomas."

            "abstract": "To date, the apocrine variant of lobular carcinoma in situ (AP-LCIS) has been cursorily described as a subtype of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). We retrospectively reviewed 34 cases of AP-LCIS (including 23 associated with invasive lobular carcinoma) to fully characterize it. AP-LCIS typically presented with screen-detected calcifications in older women (mean age: 65 y) and was characterized by distended terminal duct lobular units with relatively large \"pleomorphic\" cells, central necrosis, and calcifications. AP-LCIS cells exhibited abundant eosinophilic occasionally granular cytoplasm, hyperchromatic nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. Synchronous classic and/or florid LCIS was identified in 24/34 (70%) AP-LCIS, and in 9/11 (82%) pure AP-LCIS. Most (68%) cases of AP-LCIS were estrogen receptor-positive (50% strongly), 35% were progesterone receptor-positive, 26% were human epidermal growth factor 2-positive, 18% demonstrated high-proliferation rate (Ki67: >15%), and 90% were androgen receptor-positive. Aurora kinase A, immunoreactive in 38% of AP-LCIS cases, was not significantly associated with recurrence, development of invasion, or nodal positivity (P>0.05). Compared with conventional (nonapocrine) pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (P-LCIS), aurora kinase A was expressed in a significantly greater proportion of P-LCIS (100%). AP-LCIS and P-LCIS did not otherwise differ in clinicopathologic features. Next-generation sequencing utilizing the Oncomine Comprehensive Panel v2, performed on 27 AP-LCIS cases, showed no specific molecular findings. In a mean follow-up of 57 months, 2 (of 11, 18%) pure AP-LCIS cases recurred (2 both in situ and invasive) and none metastasized or proved fatal. AP-LCIS should be regarded as another high-grade LCIS similar to P-LCIS in many respects, and pending additional studies should be managed similarly."

However, results relating its expression to the prognosis of breast cancer are still controversial, and all studies carried out to date have failed to show a relationship between the expression of BRMS1 and axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. It has been recently suggested that BRMS1 may exert its physiological role through the modulation of apoptosis. In order to test this hypothesis, we studied the expression of BRMS1 and genes known to be directly related with apoptosis in human breast carcinoma. The expression of mRNA corresponding to BRMS1, BCL2, BAX, CASP3 and the apoptosis-related X-chromosome RNA binding motif (RBM) genes (RBMX, RBM3, RBM10 small and large variant) was studied by means of differential RT-PCR in 94 samples obtained from previously untreated patients with breast carcinoma. A significant (p=0.03) inverse correlation between BRMS1 mRNA expression and expression of the mRNA corresponding to the large variant of the X-chromosome RBM10 gene was found. The degree of direct correlation with another member of the X-chromosome RBM gene family, RBMX, almost attained statistical significance (p=0.06). These results point towards a possible link between BRMS1 expression and apoptosis in human breast cancer through a relationship with the expression of genes belonging to the X-chromosome RBM family."

They are predominantly found in the liver where they metabolize numerous drugs and endogenous substances such as oestrogens. However, they are also expressed by normal and tumoural extrahepatic tissues. Accordingly, immunolocalization was assessed in malignant breast tumours (n=32) and normal counterparts, by using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes all human CYP3A proteins. We investigated a potential relation between expression of CYP3A protein expression, the degree of tumour differentiation assessed by the histological grade and the proliferation index assessed by Ki-67 immunostaining. Immunodetection of CYP3A was observed in 27 of the 32 tumours analyzed (84%). A focal staining was also observed in the adjacent normal breast tissue in 33% of the samples, but expression was always fainter than in tumours. A significant negative association was found between CYP3A and the proliferation index, but there was no relation with receptor status or tumour differentiation. While CYP3A protein expression can be found in normal breast tissues, these data highlight higher and more frequent CYP3A in malignant breast cells. Such expression in malignant breast cells appears inversely related to the proliferation index whereas no relation is found with tumour differentiation."

Previously, using a gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry (IHC) screen, we identified TRPS-1 as a highly prevalent gene in breast cancer (BC), expressed in >90% of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)(+) and ERα(-) BC subtypes. TRPS-1 was also shown to be expressed in prostate cancer where it was shown to play a proapoptotic function during androgen withdrawal possibly through regulating antioxidant metabolism. The role of TRPS-1 and its prognostic significance in hormone-dependent and hormone-independent BC however is not known. In this study, we developed a new quantitative IHC (qIHC) method to further study TRPS-1 as a marker and possible prognostic indicator in BC. By using this method, a quantitative parameter for TRPS-1 expression called a quick score (QS) was derived from the measured labeling index and mean optical density after IHC and applied to a set of 152 stage II/III BC patients from 1993 to 2006 who did not receive preoperative chemotherapy. Associations between QS and tumor characteristics were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. A wide range of TRPS-1 QS was found among the sample set with higher TRPS-1 QS significantly associated with tumor ERα (p = 0.023 for QS and p = 0.028 for Allred score), progesterone receptor (p = 0.009), and GATA-3 (p < 0.0001). TRPS-1 QS was also positively associated with HER2 status (p = 0.026). Further analysis of different ductal structures in ten BC cases revealed that TRPS-1 expression was expressed at low levels in the remaining normal ducts and in areas of usual ductal hyperplasia but showed marked increase in expression in ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma lesions in the tissue. An analysis of TRPS-1 expression in association with overall survival in the 152 stage II/III sample set also revealed that TRPS-1 QS (≥4.0) was significantly associated with improved survival (p = 0.0165). Patients with TRPS-1 QS <4 had a hazard ratio of 2 (p = 0.019) after univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis. In summary, this new qIHC approach was found to reveal critical differences in TRPS-1 expression in primary BC samples and found that it is a promising prognostic marker that should be further evaluated as a possible tumor suppressor gene facilitating improved survival in different subtypes of BC."

Expression of cathepsin D was identified within the epithelial and stromal components of all tumours examined. No significant associations of increased cathepsin D expression in the epithelial tumour component with conventional prognostic indices such as tumour size, grade, lymph node stage, or patient survival were identified. However, significant associations of increased stromal cathepsin D expression and high tumour grade, chi 2 = 11.40 (df = 2), p = 0.003; increased tendency to local recurrence, chi 2 = 6.87 (df = 1), p = 0.009; regional recurrence, chi 2 = 7.44 (df = 1), p = 0.006; poorer disease free survival, chi 2 = 14.9 (df = 1), p = 0.0001; and poorer overall patient survival, chi 2 = 6.90 (df = 1), p = 0.0086, were identified. Cathepsin D expression is present in all breast tumours. Stromal cathepsin D expression is a neglected immunohistochemical prognostic parameter which could explain some of the previous apparently conflicting reports concerning the effect on patient prognosis of biochemical (i.e. total) and immunohistochemical estimations of cathepsin D in breast cancers."

            "abstract": "Papillary lesions of the breast continue to be a diagnostic challenge because of the wide morphologic spectrum that may be encountered in these lesions. A rare entity termed \"breast tumor resembling the tall cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma\" is considered to be a subtype of papillary carcinoma of the breast. It is characterized by distinct morphologic features, setting it apart from typical papillary carcinoma of the breast. Its resemblance to papillary thyroid carcinoma in conjunction with the established terminology may cause confusion, resulting in unnecessary ancillary studies to exclude the association of this lesion with papillary thyroid carcinoma. As immunohistochemical and molecular studies have shown no evidence to support any association between this entity and papillary thyroid carcinoma, we propose to change the current terminology of \"breast tumor resembling the tall cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma\" to the term \"tall cell variant of papillary breast carcinoma.\""

However, the role of CHPF in breast carcinoma (BRCA) and its underlying mechanism are still not fully elucidated. Expression profiles for CHPF in BRCA tissues were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and used for prognostic analysis. Cell viability, invasion and migration were measured in vitro using MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines upon knockdown or over-expression of CHPF. Bioinformatic analysis showed that CHPF was substantially upregulated in BRCA tissues, and a quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed to confirm its upregulation in BRCA cells. High expression of CHPF was observed to be significantly associated with pathologic stage, metastasis and worse prognosis. We also observed that depletion of CHPF significantly inhibited cell proliferative, invasive and migratory abilities, whereas overexpression of CHPF exerted the opposite effects. Furthermore, analysis of the GEPIA database revealed that CHPF expression is positively correlated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related markers vimentin, Snail, Slug and motion-related protein matrix metallopeptidase 2; these findings were confirmed via western blotting. Our data suggest that CHPF may contribute to BRCA progression by modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related markers and matrix metallopeptidase 2 expression."

Furthermore, there are racial differences in breast carcinoma incidence, mortality, and survival rates. Social and economic factors within racial/ethnic groups are being examined as risk factors not only for breast carcinoma mortality and survival but also as determinants of the rate of incidence. Social and economic factors have been associated in the literature predominantly with cancer mortality and survival. When socioeconomic status (SES) is considered, certain studies suggest that racial disparities in breast carcinoma are smaller than when social and economic factors are examined alone, but these disparities still persist. Sources of data for this discussion include the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] program, a group of population-based cancer registries that cover up to 14% of the U.S. population. SEER reports cancer incidence, mortality, and survival rates), the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and numerous articles from the scientific literature. Socioeconomic factors or SES can be considered \"cross-cutting risk factors\" (i.e., they can be related to the risk of developing breast carcinoma [rate of incidence] as well as to the risk of dying [mortality] from this disease). They also are the risk factors that \"cut across\" racial and ethnic populations. Socioeconomic factors are related to breast carcinoma mortality and survival rates in multicultural women. Racial disparities in breast carcinoma mortality and survival rates can be explained partially by stage distribution at the time of diagnosis, which may be related to SES. For example, African-American women present with more advanced stage distributions for breast carcinoma than white women. Similarly, women of lower SES present with higher stage disease than women of upper SES who present with more localized breast carcinoma. The lack of data regarding the SES of cancer patients limits our understanding of the contributions of SES to cancer incidence and mortality rates. SES appears to be related to breast carcinoma incidence, mortality, and survival rates. Breast carcinoma mortality is higher in women of lower SES. Additional research on SES, race, culture, and the relation of these factors to cancer incidence rate is needed."

            "abstract": "While the importance of intrafamilial communication of hereditary cancer risk has been acknowledged, the factors that promote and act as barriers to patients disclosing their information to their families are complex and emerging. This raises the question: How are patients guided in practice to contemplate intrafamilial communication? Focusing on breast cancer, we conducted an exploratory study examining current resources supporting patients and health-care professionals, and isolated the messages surrounding intrafamilial communication of cancer risk. We find the duty for health-care professionals to counsel patients regarding intrafamilial communication is acknowledged to varying degrees by multiple actors in the cancer care delivery landscape, including health-care professional associations, health service organizations, and patient groups. A range of medical, psychosocial, and other factors underlying intrafamilial communication are acknowledged in messages to patients. Patients, however, are often referred to a single group of health-care professionals to discuss their diverse and complex needs. At the same time, messages aimed at patients appear to place the emphasis on barriers that could exist for patients contemplating intrafamilial communication, while highlighting the benefits families derive from such communication. Taken together, this points to a lack of coherence within materials directed to patients and suggests the need to do coordinated research among stakeholders to address two related issues: (1) determining who are the actors best positioned to send messages surrounding intrafamilial communication to patients and (2) addressing the content of messages conveyed in patient materials."

            "abstract": "We examined the expression and ligand specificity of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin on human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) and a panel of breast carcinoma cell lines in vitro. We found that the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin was universally, but quite variably expressed on these cells by FACS analysis. No significant correlation was observed between its expression and other known cellular phenotypes. Substrate attachment assays using blocking antibodies demonstrated that alpha 2 beta 1 integrin served as a receptor for collagen on HMEC and almost all breast carcinoma cells. However, its contribution to laminin binding of these cells appeared to be related to cellular differentiation as evaluated by sex steroid receptor status and by markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, i.e. loss of E-cadherin and expression of vimentin. Two different populations of non-malignant immortalized HMEC (184A1N4 and MCF-10A) contained cells capable of using alpha 2 beta 1 integrin as a laminin receptor. Breast cancer cell lines positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and E-cadherin (MCF-7, T47D, ZR75-1) could also use alpha 2 beta 1 integrin as a laminin receptor. Conversely, alpha 2 beta 1 integrin appeared to be incapable of binding to laminin or to be a very minor receptor for laminin on metastatic ER-negative breast carcinoma cells that expressed vimentin (MDA-MB 231, MDA-MB 435, and MDA-MB 436). These findings suggest that the ligand specificity of alpha 2 beta 1 integrin, i.e. its function as a laminin receptor, may be regulated during the malignant progression of breast carcinoma cells. A reduced contribution of alpha 2 beta 1 integrin to the cellular laminin binding appears to be associated with an increased malignant phenotype and with an epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast carcinoma cells."

            "abstract": "Expression of the calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin has been examined in 187 primary breast carcinomas using an immunohistochemical technique. The pattern and extent of reactivity has been correlated with clinicopathological data including tumour type, grade and lymph node status and with other prognostic parameters including oestrogen receptor (ER) status, expression of c-erbB-2, pS2 protein and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Two patterns of E-cadherin staining were observed in carcinomas, membrane reactivity and a diffuse cytoplasmic staining. A marked difference in expression of E-cadherin was observed between infiltrating lobular carcinomas (ILC) and infiltrating ductal carcinomas (IDC), the former showing complete loss of membrane staining, whereas 93% of IDC retained some level of expression. In IDC reactivity was not related to tumour grade but there was a significant association between reduced membrane levels of E-cadherin and the presence of lymph node metastasis, and a highly significant correlation between the presence of cytoplasmic E-cadherin and metastasis. A significant relationship was also demonstrated between reduced E-cadherin reactivity and expression of EGFR. These findings emphasise the complexity of control of E-cadherin in breast carcinomas and provide evidence of a link between membrane signalling pathways and modulation of E-cadherin expression."

D-OBS was validated using measured F2 -isoprostanes and metabolites. High E-DII score and low D-OBS represent a more proinflammatory and prooxidant diet, respectively, and associations of quartiles of each index with breast cancer (BC) risk were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.

The procedure and subsequent postoperative follow-up visits were unremarkable without complications. However, once she entered an magnetic resonance imaging examination room for evaluation of an incidentally found meningioma, the carbon dioxide reservoir valve in both expanders was suddenly activated, releasing filling gas and maximally inflating the device to its 800-mL capacity.

Associations with clinicopathologic variables and the prognostic markers Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1 were investigated and statistically analyzed. Population difference in breast cancer subtypes was detected, suggesting etiologic and genetic heterogeneity among demographic groups. As reported worldwide, most tumors were luminal A (39.2%), but basal-like and unclassified subtypes had higher proportions among our cohort (16.8% and 16%, respectively), particularly in premenopausal patients (P = .0001), in contrast to postmenopausal African Americans, premenopausal European Americans, and other populations. Her2-overexpressing subtype was the least common subtype (13.65%) among our patients, although it is more common in Asians. Basal-like and unclassified carcinomas were more frequently grade 3 neoplasms (P = .035). Lobular histology was distributed among luminal A, B and unclassified subtypes (P = .006). The highest frequency of nodal positivity was associated with Her2 overexpressing carcinomas (94.1%, P = .0001). Luminal and unclassified carcinomas more likely expressed Bcl-2 (P = .011) and Cyclin D1 (P = .0001), whereas basal and Her2 subtypes had the lowest expression levels. Immunohistochemistry-based subtyping can be helpful in separating breast carcinoma into subtypes that vary in distribution among different populations.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND An epithelial inclusion cyst within a lymph node denotes a heterotopic phenomenon. Nodal epithelial inclusion cysts have been reported in a variety of anatomical locations including pelvic, abdominal, mediastinal, and axillary regions. While nodal melanocytic nevus (also known as nevus cell aggregates) is the most common heterotopic phenomena involving the axillary lymph nodes, the presence of benign epithelial inclusion cysts in axillary lymph nodes is a rare but well-reported finding. Such documentation is in part due to assessment of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer becoming standard of care. These epithelial inclusion cysts offer a diagnostic pitfall in evaluation of sentinel lymph node in the setting of breast carcinoma. They also complicate assessment of sentinel lymph node during intraoperative frozen sections analysis. CASE REPORT We report a case of co-existent of benign squamous-type and glandular-type epithelial inclusions cysts in 2 sentinel lymph nodes in a patient with grade III invasive ductal carcinoma involving the left breast. There have been at least 4 cases reported in literature in which benign epithelial inclusion cysts in sentinel lymph nodes were first mistakenly diagnosed as metastatic carcinoma both during intraoperative frozen section analysis and during review of permanent sections. The missed diagnosis could potentially occur intraoperatively during frozen section sentinel lymph node analysis secondarily due to lack of availability of the primary tumor for comparison and inability to use immunohistochemical stains. CONCLUSIONS Pathologists should be aware of this pitfall especially in frozen section analysis of sentinel lymph node to avoid misdiagnosis and its associated potential grave consequences."

The aim of this paper is to study couples' communication frequency and link it to depressive symptomatology. Marital communication was assessed with three scales: frequency of general communication, frequency of communication about cancer and satisfaction with communication. About one month following surgery, 120 breast cancer patients were interviewed; only 11 partners (9%) refused to be interviewed. Results show less communication is associated with higher depressive level. Patients and partners with a passable level of communication, particularly about cancer, are clinically at risk for depression. Communicating frequently about cancer in the couple seems thus associated with a positive effect, i.e. a depressive level found in the general population. Direction of causality between frequency of marital communication and depressive symptomatology cannot be established from this study."

New vessel formation has been reported as a prognostic indicator in breast carcinoma, but little information is available about its significance in DCIS. This study was planned to examine angiogenesis in DCIS in relation to histologic subtype, proliferation activity, p53 and bcl-2 expression.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Paraffin sections from 24 cases of DCIS (9 comedo and 15 non comedo type) were studied immunohistochemically using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to von Willebrand factor, Ki-67, p53 (clone 1801) and bcl-2 proteins. The streptavidine-biotin technique with microwave antigen retrieval was employed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Most cases showed enhanced microvessel formation around ducts with DCIS compared to normal ducts. Comedo carcinomas (CCs) showed enhanced neovascularization compared to non comedo carcinomas (NCCs). Growth fraction determination with Ki-67 antibody showed that 78% of the CCs expressed high proliferating activity compared to 27% of the NCCs. p53 immunoexpression was noted in 78% of the CCs and 20% of the NCCs. Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was observed in 67% of the total cases in 58% of which there was no association with p53 expression. However, an association was found between neovascularization and overexpression of Ki-67 and p53.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study suggests that neovascularization is an early phenomenon in breast neoplasia and is apparent as early as the in situ stage. CCs express a more aggressive immunophenotype, compared to the other DCIS subtypes, characterized by increased stromal interaction, high proliferating activity, p53 overexpression and a near lack of bcl-2 immunostaining."

Elucidation of the genetic control of metastatic propensity of a tumor is important in determining prognosis and choice of therapy. Expression of nm23, a putative metastasis suppressor gene, has been detected in human breast cancers, but studies have not consistently shown high levels of the Nm23 messenger RNA or protein to be associated with better histological differentiation. This inconsistency suggests that Nm23 protein may act independently as a metastasis suppressor.\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the relationship of Nm23 protein expression with 1) histology in ductal breast carcinoma in situ and 2) the variables considered to be the major prognostic indicators in invasive breast carcinoma.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We obtained formalin-fixed biopsy specimens of breast tissue excised from 128 patients with breast lesions detected by mammography. Of these patients, 35 had been diagnosed with benign breast disease, 26 with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and 67 with invasive carcinoma. Tissue sections were embedded in paraffin blocks, and immunohistochemical staining was used to determine Nm23 expression. Specimens were rated positive if all lesional epithelium was stained and negative if any lesional epithelium was unstained. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple regression analysis because of nonorthogonality of the data.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All 35 examples of benign breast disease showed uniform epithelial cell staining. The seven cases of comedo DCIS were negative for Nm23 protein; all 18 noncomedo types were positive. Nm23 negativity was significantly associated with worsening invasive ductal carcinoma grade and advancing lymph node stage but not with tumor diameter or vascular invasion. Despite the putative antimetastatic role of the nm23 gene, no statistically significant association was found between Nm23 protein expression and vascular invasion.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The precise role of the nm23 gene remains to be established, but our simplified immunohistochemical rating system shows an association between Nm23 protein expression and the two most significant prognostic factors relating to histologic grade and stage. Nm23 negativity distinguished comedo ductal carcinoma in situ from the other histological types, a finding consistent with the fact that comedo histology is known to have a higher likelihood of becoming invasive and of having higher cell proliferation rates and higher expression of growth factor (c-erb B2) receptor."

LCIS was more likely to be associated with an invasive lobular carcinoma (30 of 59 patients; 51%) than with invasive ductal carcinoma (26 of 1125 patients; 2%). Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) occurred in 57 of 1209 patients (5%) without LCIS compared with 10 of 65 patients (15%) with LCIS (P = 0.001). The 10-year cumulative incidence rate of IBTR was 6% in women without LCIS compared with 29% in women with LCIS (P = 0.0003). In both groups, the majority of recurrences were invasive. The 10-year cumulative incidence rate of IBTR in patients who received tamoxifen was 8% when LCIS was present compared with 6% when LCIS was absent (P = 0.46). Subsets of patients in which the presence of LCIS was associated with an increased risk of breast recurrence included tumor size < 2 cm (T1), age < 50 years, invasive ductal carcinoma, negative lymph node status, and the absence of any adjuvant systemic treatment (chemotherapy or hormonal therapy) (P < 0.001). LCIS margin status, invasive lobular carcinoma histology, T2 tumor size, and positive axillary lymph nodes were not associated with an increased risk of breast recurrence in these women.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The authors conclude that the presence of LCIS significantly increases the risk of an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence in certain subsets of patients who are treated with breast-conserving therapy.

Epidemiological studies highlight age, gender and use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy as potential risk factors for second primary cancers (SPCs). Mutations in BRCA2, CDKN2A, CDK4 and BAP1 may partly underlie any SPC association. The impact of socio-cultural factors and surveillance bias may be attributed to the findings of SPC partially or entirely.

Among the most important of these is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a specific mitogen for endothelium, which increases vascular permeability and induces proteolytic enzymes necessary for vascular remodeling. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can express complex functions related to tumor biology, including growth, proliferative rate, stroma formation and dissolution, and neovascularization. The aim of this study was to define, using immunohistochemical analysis, the microvessel density (MVD), VEGF expression, and TAMs level in 97 human invasive ductal breast carcinomas not otherwise specified (NOS), investigate a possible relationship between them and then correlate their values with tumor grade, mitotic activity index (MAI), tumor size and lymph-node status. Statistical analysis showed a strong positive relationship between MVD and VEGF expression ( P<0.001). Furthermore, both MVD and VEGF expression were significantly correlated with tumor grade and lymph-node status, and TAMs infiltration with MAI. TAM level showed a significant positive connection with VEGF expression and MVD. These in situ observations suggest that VEGF stimulates angiogenesis in human invasive ductal breast carcinoma NOS and attracts macrophages to the tumor locus, which then may be involved in angiogenesis promotion. The expression of this angiogenic molecule, and MVD and TAM level, can provide additional prognostic significance and help in the identification of patients who need postoperative adjuvant therapy."

Sixty-six early stage breast cancer patients diagnosed less than one year completed a written questionnaire. Results indicated that the women reported confiding in family and friends more than in mental health workers. Fears of recurrence and worries about the effects of the illness on family members were the most important concerns, whereas concerns about body image were the least troublesome. Failure to disclose concerns was associated with low social support, high unsupportive social interactions, and low emotional well-being. Most of the unsupportive responses received from other people were either behaviors of minimizing or distancing.

Strong efforts are ongoing in the fields of genetics and breast cancer research to achieve earlier detection of breast cancer and a reduction in morbidity regardless of the stage of the breast carcinoma. As results of ongoing studies materialize and new studies are funded, it is hoped that more answers will emerge to combat the devastating effects of breast cancer."

Fifteen patients showed multiple or diffuse lesions and three patients showed single lesions. Ten patients (55.6%) had bilateral lesions. Mammography revealed high density (15 cases, 93.8%), round to oval (11 cases, 68.8%) lesions with poorly defined or obscured margins (12 cases, 75.0%). No associated calcification was found in any lesion. Ultrasonographically, poorly defined (8 cases, 53.3%), irregularly shaped (8 cases, 53.3%), hypoechoic (14 cases, 93.3%), heterogeneous (8 cases, 53.3%) lesions were predominantly distributed superficially (11 cases, 73.3%). Axillary lymphadenopathy was detected in six patients (33.3%). The longest diameter of most of the lesions was less than 2.0 cm (13 cases, 81.3%). We conclude that metastatic tumors to the breast appear as relatively small, superficially located, poorly defined, irregular nodules without calcification on mammography and ultrasonography. However, when the metastatic lesion is diffuse, the appearance is indistinguishable from that of inflammatory breast carcinoma."

Fifty cases of breast carcinoma with preoperative cytologic diagnosis were assigned tumor grade. Histologic grading was done on corresponding mastectomy or partially resected specimens. Statistical analysis was performed; correlation between cytologic and histologic grading was established using Spearman correlation coefficient. Regression analysis was done to assess the significance of each cytological feature. Univariate analysis showed strong correlation (P < 0.01) for all features except dissociation. Multiple regression analysis of cytologic features revealed cell dissociation nucleoli and nuclear margin as the most influential features. A concordance of 72.5% between RGS (cyto) and SBR (cyto), 64% for RGS (cyto) and SBR (histo), 82% for SBR (cyto) and SBR (histo) was noted. There was a significant association (P < 0.001) between the grades assigned to cytologic and histologic specimens.

Newman-Keuls tests demonstrated the same pattern of results for each factor--those who imagined that the patient was their mother rated her as experiencing less mood disturbance than did those who imagined that she was a woman they worked with or a well-known public figure.

Immunohistochemistry for BAP1 protein provides a rapid and inexpensive method for screening suspected cases. Notably, some patients with BAP1-mutant meningiomas have germline BAP1 mutations and BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome (TPDS). It appears that nearly all patients with germline BAP1 mutations develop malignancies by age 55, most frequently uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma, or renal cell carcinoma, although other cancers have also been associated with BAP1 TPDS. Therefore, when confronted with a patient with a potentially high-grade rhabdoid meningioma, it is important that neuropathologists assess the BAP1 status of the tumor and that the patient's family history of cancer is carefully ascertained. In the appropriate clinical setting, genetic counseling and germline BAP1 DNA sequencing should be performed. A cancer surveillance program for individuals who carry germline BAP1 mutations may help identify tumors such as uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma at early and treatable stages. Because BAP1-mutant meningiomas are rare tumors, multi-institutional efforts will be needed to evaluate therapeutic strategies and to further define the clinicopathologic features of these tumors."

To date, five TGF-beta isotypes have been identified, three of these in mammalian systems. A number of cultured human breast carcinoma cell lines produce biologically inactive latent TGF-beta and are growth inhibited by activated TGF-beta; TGF-beta production is estrogen-influenced in some of these cell lines. To investigate the potential role of the TGF-beta isotypes in human breast disease, we localized TGF-beta s 1, 2, and 3 immunohistochemically in normal breast, fibrocystic change, epithelial hyperplasia, sclerosing adenosis, fibroadenoma, cystosarcoma phyllodes, and several carcinoma variants. Transforming growth factor-beta s 1, 2, and 3 were identified intracellularly in most active mammary epithelia, regardless of the lesion, including carcinoma; the associated stroma contained little or no intracellular TGF-beta. An antibody that recognizes an extracellular conformation of TGF-beta stained normal intralobular stroma and, more extensively, the stroma of active fibroadenomas and low-grade phyllodes tumors and the desmoplastic stroma of carcinomas. The results indicate the potential for paracrine and autocrine regulation of the mammary gland by TGF-beta and suggest an association between TGF-beta and abnormal stromal proliferations. Altered expression of TGF-beta s 1, 2, and 3 at the protein level in mammary epithelia appears not to be a major feature of most breast lesions, raising the possibility that altered cellular response to the TGF-beta already present may play a role in the development of breast disease."

            "title": "[The pathology of meningiomas; a study of 121 cases].",
            "abstract": "Although the biologic behavior of meningiomas is relatively uniform, their histologic appearance is variable. Because of this, numerous classifications1-7 of two fundamental types have been proposed for them: embryologic and purely morphologic. The embryologic approach, best exemplified in the study by Globus,' aims at finding evidence of different stages of embryologic development of the meninges in the different appearances of the tumor. There are, however, several objections to this method. First, the origin of the meninges in neuro-ectoderm or mesoderm is still uncertain. In fact the importance of this origin probably has been over-emphasized. In discussing the classification of tumors in general, Willis8 recently stated: \"The germ-layers, the status of which has of recent years greatly declined even for the embryologist, are devoid of significance for the pathologist.\" Secondly, the analogy between the neoplasm and the developing meninges based on microscopic appearance is easy to make but difficult to prove. Such an idea, therefore, must remain merely an hypothesis. Lastly, the correlation between prognosis and so-called histofunctional differentiation is so poor that classifications based on embryogenetic concepts cannot be justified even on clinical grounds. In the morphologic approach an attempt is made to classify meningiomas by the histologic features considered most prominent. Such classifications are valuable to the pathologist, but difficulties are encountered when the schemes become too complicated. This is frequently the case since, as it is well known, meningiomas are extremely polymorphic. Cushing and Eisenhardt,6 in their morphologic classi-fication, thus achieved nine types subdivided into twenty variants, although they admitted that \"Fine architectural distinctions, while of academic interest, are unimportant unless they can be shown to have some bearing on clinical treatment and prognosis.\" The latter obviously is not true of the existing classifications. Based on a study of I2I meningiomas, it is our intention to present a new approach which affords a means for describing rather than classifying these neoplasms and in so doing sets up diagnostic criteria. The most important step in the understanding of these tumors was made by Schmidt\" in 1902, when he discovered that the cellular structure of meningiomas was comparable to cell clusters capping the arachnoid villi and the cell nests included in the dura mater. This work unfortunately was forgotten until Cushing,10 in 1922, re-emphasized the finding and further showed that the location of such cell nests were \"favoured seats of origin\" of meningiomas. The structural identity of normal arachnoid villi and the meningioma is indeed striking and offers the best criterion for recognition of the tumor. Such an origin explains why meningiomas, although arachnoidal in origin, are frequently adherent to the dura mater, but may occur in other regions such as the ventricular system or Sylvian fissure, without attachment to pachymeninges. With this in mind, the description of meningiomas may be considered. These neoplasms are composed of two parts: (i) the basic cellular constituents which are meningocytic or fibroblastic cells organized at least in some places in a specific pattern known as a whorl; (2) the secondary components made up of different forms of tissue which may be absent, minimal, or prominent in the tumor. The meningeal origin of the neoplasm can be established with certainty only when some part of it contains meningocytic or fibroblastic cells arranged in a whorl pattern. The secondary components are not essential to the diagnosis although they are seen in recurrent patterns which frequently are of aid to the pathologist. The meningiomas will thus be considered using the following outline. It is emphasized that this is viewed as a description rather than as a classification. Such a plan is flexible but precise and clear. Any meningioma can be defined exactly, if necessary, by addition of new components. For example, a tumor may be described as meningocytic meningioma with prominent angiomatous component. This concept not only provides rigid criteria for the diagnosis of the neoplasm but also enables the problem of differential diagnosis of other neoplasms of the meninges to be handled easily. As will be shown, these other tumors can reproduce the patterns of secondary components but do not contain the basic cellular constituents."

The changes in BC mortality for all women were associated with changes in consumption of fat, sugar and animal protein 1-2 decades earlier. A decline in mortality around 1935 was not obviously related to changes in fat or sugar, but dietary data were sparse. The social-class gradient of BC mortality almost disappeared during the 1950s; rates declined for the upper classes but increased for the lower. These opposite changes could have resulted from the opposite changes in diets of the upper and lower classes which occurred in the early 1940s. In contrast, the geographical variation of BC mortality within the United Kingdom, by region or by urban-rural aggregate area, was closely correlated with child-bearing but poorly correlated with diet. The poor correlation with diet might be a consequence of the small range of variation of diet between regions of the United Kingdom. The regional gradient of BC mortality was low in 1961, a decade after the period of food rationing when regional variation in diet would have been reduced. This suggested that diet did contribute to the regional variation of BC mortality within the United Kingdom, perhaps jointly with contributions from child-bearing."

Approximately one-third of the cases in the initial series contained a focal spindle cell metaplastic component. The tumors are reported to have an aggressive behavior, but because some contain a spindle cell metaplastic component, it is unclear whether the metaplastic component or other clinicopathologic features account for the poor clinical outcome. We identified 37 cases of pleomorphic carcinoma of the breast and evaluated the association between clinical outcome and multiple clinicopathologic features. Patients with invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma and those without at least a tissue biopsy before chemotherapy were excluded. Patients ranged in age from 23 to 78 years (median, 49 y). Tumor size was >5 cm in 12 cases and <5 cm in 22. A focal spindle cell component (<25% of the tumor) was present in 14 tumors (38%). Clinical follow-up was available for 36 patients (median, 17 mo). In multivariate analysis, when the 2 stage-IV patients were excluded, the presence of a spindle cell component and tumor size >5 cm were each independently associated with decreased overall survival. The actuarial 5-year overall survival for patients with and without a metaplastic spindle cell component was 38%+/-15% and 89%+/-7%, respectively. Poor clinical outcome, therefore, is associated with the subset of pleomorphic carcinomas with a spindle cell metaplastic component.

While in vitro, we employed siRNA technique to knock down EHD2 expressions and observed their effects on breast cancer cells growth. EHD2 depletion by siRNA promoted PCNA expression, and it was concurrent with the decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin and the increased expression of N-cadherin by Western blot analysis. Consistent with these observations, the suppression of EHD2 in breast cancer cells remarkably promoted cellular proliferation and migration. On the basis of these results, we suggested that EHD2 can inhibit the metastasis of human breast cancer by regulating the EMT key markers E-cadherin and N-cadherin."

            "abstract": "Young age can be an independent prognostic factor for adverse prognosis in women with breast carcinoma (BC). In younger women, BC exhibited more aggressive pathological features than older women, indicating differences in biology. Frequent alterations in chromosomal (chr.) 3p22.3 in different malignancies indicated the existence of multiple candidate tumor suppressor genes (TSG) in this region, yet its association with BC remains unclear. In an effort to understand the differences in molecular pathogenesis in two age groups of BC, detailed analysis of alterations at chr.3p22.3 region was carried out in 47 early onset (group-A: < or =40 years) and 59 late-onset (group-A: >40 years) BC samples. Deletion mapping of the four candidate TSG, hMLH1, APRG1, ITGA9 and RBSP3/HYA22, located within 1 Mb of chr.3p22.3 showed high deletion in hMLH1 and RBSP3/HYA22 genes. Frequent methylation was also observed in these genes and significantly associated with their deletion. Quantitative messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and immunohistochemical analysis showed down-regulation of these genes. Alterations (deletion/methylation) of hMLH1 were significantly associated with RBSP3/HYA22 in group-A (P = 0.02). Significant poor survival in group-A patients with alterations in hMLH1 and RBSP3/HYA22 and the same in group-B patients with hMLH1 alterations indicated their importance as prognostic markers. Differential association of alterations of these genes with higher histological grades, more advanced stages and positive lymph node involvement were also seen. Thus, the present study suggests hMLH1 and RBSP3/HYA22 to be candidate TSG associated with development of both early and late-onset BC undergoing frequent genetic and epigenetic alteration and having significant prognostic implications."

The claudin-low intrinsic subtype of invasive carcinoma is associated with high-grade carcinoma, low junction molecule expression, and worse response to chemotherapy. However, it is not known whether the expression of claudins may provide clues as to carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) prognosis.

            "abstract": "Ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS) is an early, noninvasive stage of breast malignancy that arises from ductal epithelium and has an especially favorable prognosis. Its biologic characteristics are consistent with a direct precursor to invasive carcinoma, which develops in the majority of cases if left untreated, generally within 10 years of diagnosis. Mammography has resulted in a substantial increase in its diagnosis, as well as a change in its presentation from large, palpable masses to nonpalpable lesions manifested primarily as microcalcifications. The same treatment options are available for DCIS as for invasive breast carcinoma, and there is also a limited role for wide local excision alone in incidental lesions. Most cases of DCIS currently are treated effectively by lumpectomy and radiation therapy, although the fact that 50% of all local breast recurrences are invasive lesions may affect survival adversely. Mastectomy is associated with the best survival rates and should be performed on any patient with factors known to pose a high risk of locoregional recurrence. There are still many outstanding issues to be resolved by further study before the intriguing potential of this disease can be realized fully."

Here the expressions of 4224 genes were analysed for association with intrinsic or acquired doxorubicin (DOX) resistance. A cluster of overexpressed genes related to DOX resistance was observed. Included in this cluster was ABCB1 the P-glycoprotein transporter protein gene and MMP1 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 1), indicative of the invasive nature of resistant cells, and the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), a potential new therapeutic target. Overexpression of genes associated with xenobiotic transformation, cell transformation, cell signalling and lymphocyte activation was also associated with DOX resistance as was estrogen receptor negativity. In all carcinoma cells, compared with HBL100 a putatively normal breast epithelial cell line, a cluster of overexpressed genes was identified which included several keratins, in particular keratins 8 and 18 which are regulated through the ras signalling pathway. Analysis of genomic amplifications and deletions revealed specific genetic alterations common to both intrinsic and acquired DOX resistance including ABCB1, PGY3 (ABCB4) and BAK. The findings shown here indicate new possibilities for the diagnosis of DOX resistance using gene expression, and potential novel therapeutic targets for pharmacological intervention."

Quality of life, depression and stress were compared between the malignant and benign groups, and the factors related to QoL were also examined. It was found that the malignant group had poorer physical and psychological QoL and higher life stress. Depression was significantly associated with QoL for both the malignant and benign groups, and the stress from health problem was the most significant predictors for QoL among the malignant group. The breast cancer patients suffered more severe psychological difficulty under active treatment than did the benign group patients. This will have great impact on their QoL, as in Western society.

In negative cases extensive axillary lymph node dissection and its associated side effects can be avoided altogether. With careful patient selection, the expertise of surgeons and pathologists can increase the sensitivity and specificity of the technique with a reduction in false negatives. A number of international studies have established the usefulness of intraoperative sentinel lymph node evaluation.

In 6/7 patients, the TERTpMut was present at initial surgery (WHO grade I-III) while in one patient the TERTpMut was found de novo when the meningioma became malignant. The incidences were 2/1.000.000/year for TERTpMut WHO grade III meningioma and 8/1.000.000/year for TERTpwt WHO grade III meningioma in our catchment area. We found a 1.7 times higher recurrence rate (CI 95% 0.65-4.44) and a 2.5 higher mortality rate per 10 person-years (CI 95% 1.01-6.19) for TERTpMut compared to TERTpwt .\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      TERTpMut can occur independently of malignant progression in meningioma and was most often present from the first tumor sample across recurring tumors. TERTpMut in WHO grade III may represent a marker of an aggressive subset of tumors."

            "abstract": "This study identified barriers and facilitators of repeat participation in mammography and breast physical examination among women ages 50 years and over. Telephone interviews were conducted with 910 women in this age group. Forty percent of respondents had never had a mammogram. Only 38% had had one in the past 12 months. Of women who had a prior mammogram, 43% had had only one. Only 60% of women had had a breast exam in the past 12 months. A physician recommendation was the single best predictor of adherence to mammography. However, only 60% of women reported that their physicians had ever recommended mammography. Several other barriers to mammography were revealed, including anxiety, embarrassment, and concerns about cost and radiation. Both a family history of breast cancer and heightened perceived vulnerability to breast cancer were associated positively with repeat mammography participation; anxiety about screening reduced the likelihood of this outcome. These findings suggest that physicians can play a powerful role in motivating women to participate in initial and subsequent breast cancer screening. Reassurance may reduce women's anxiety and embarrassment and increase utilization further."

In several studies, response to chemotherapy according to various parameters has shown strong inter-individual variability. We investigated whether different prognostic factors, including ALDH1 expression, might predict response to NACT in female patients with locally advanced breast carcinoma. ER, PR, Her2/neu, Ki-67 and ALDH1 immunohistochemistry were performed on the initial biopsy and subsequent resection specimens. Residual tumour burden was calculated in post NACT resection specimens using residual cancer burden (RCB) protocol. Of our cohort of 66 patients, 24 (36 %) achieved pCR. Triple negative phenotype and high Ki-67 proliferative index (>40 %) were significantly associated with good response to NACT. ALDH1 expression in tumour epithelial (20 %) or stromal (44 %) cells did not correlate with tumour grade, molecular subtype, proliferative index or NACT response. However, epithelial and stromal ALDH1 expression was significantly increased in residual tumour after NACT. In conclusion, triple negative phenotype and high proliferative index, but not ALDH1 expression, are predictive of good pathological response to NACT. Increased ALDH1 expression following NACT might be associated with a higher probability of recurrent disease."

It aims at reflecting a relative measure of association within a specific set of functional groups, and a specific set of clinical statuses. The proposed methodology is based on extracting features (scores) from expression sets that relate genes to multiple cancer subtypes (clinical statuses), and use those features (scores) to associate cancer subtypes with functional groups. It proposes combining t-test scores at several levels of cancer statuses' differentiation to calculate such gene features. It also proposes using contingency based measures as Jaccard and F-measure to associate gene functional groups to multiple cancer subtypes/statuses. Variations from the original Jaccard measure are proposed to reflect scores of genes' relations to classes/groups rather than using binary relations. The core objective of the experimental study is to identify the functional categories of genes that mark the change in lymph node status under each of oestrogen receptor positive and negative statuses in breast cancer expression sets."

Cox regression analysis was used to assess breast cancer survival in relation to age at diagnosis, age at first birth, time since last birth and parity. We stratified the analyses by age at diagnosis (<50 and ≥ 50 years) as an approximation for menopausal age. In women diagnosed before 50 years of age, breast cancer survival was reduced with younger age at diagnosis (p for trend <0.001), whereas in women diagnosed at 50 years or later, survival was reduced with older age at diagnosis (p for trend 0.011). For breast cancer diagnosed before 50 years, survival was poorer in women with four or more births compared to women with one or two births (hazard ratio 1.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1-1.6). A short time since last birth was associated with reduced survival (p for trend 0.05), but adjustment for stage and grade attenuated the association. Among women diagnosed at 50 years or later, we found no association with survival for any of the reproductive factors.

The possible prognostic value of LEA.135 was also compared with some widely utilized prognostic biomarkers such as c-erbB 2, topoisomerase II.alpha (TPII.alpha), MIB 1, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), as well as age of the patients and clinicopathologic parameters. The study was carried out by immunohistochemical methods on formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded tissue sections in a series of 225 patients with median follow-up of 8.5 years. Prognostic significance of the biomarkers was determined by two-sided p value. In this series of patients, among the age and clinicopathologic parameters, only age, was significantly associated with a decreased overall survival (logrank p = 0.027). Among the prognostic biomarkers, TPII a expression at high (> 50% positive cells) or moderate (6-50% positive cells) level was associated with an increased rate of recurrence (logrank p < 0.001). However, the association of TPII.alpha expression with a decreased overall survival failed to reach a statistically significance. Expression of c-erbB 2 showed a trend of being associated with an increased probability of recurrence, but the association did not reach statistical significance. The remaining biomarkers were not associated with either the probability of recurrence or overall survival. LEA.135 expression was observed in 163 (72.4%) of the 225 patients. The patients with high (> 50% positive cells) or moderate (6-50% positive cells) level of LEA.135-positive cancer cells showed a significantly decreased probability of recurrence (logrank p < 0.001) and an increased overall survival (logrank p < 0.001) compared with those with LEA.135-negative cancer cells. The association remained significant by multivariate analysis for recurrence (likelihood ratio test p < 0.001) and overall survival (likelihood ratio test p < 0.001) when assessed with other prognostic parameters. Furthermore, the combination of LEA.135 with other prognostic biomarkers stratified four subgroups of patients with distinct clinical outcome. The subgroup of patients who were LEA.135+/TPII.alpha- showed the lowest probability of recurrence and the longest overall survival compared with those who were LEA.135-/TPII.alpha+ (logrank p < 0.001). Interestingly, the patients whose cancer cells were LEA.135+/TPII.alpha+, LEA.135+ MIB.1+ or LEA.135+/c-erbB 2+ experienced a decreased probability of recurrence and an increased overall survival compared with those with LEA.135-/TPII.alpha+, LEA.135- MIB.1+ or LEA.135-/c-erbB 2+ (logrank p < 0.001). The results demonstrated that LEA.135 is an independent and favorable prognostic biomarker for patients with primary invasive breast carcinoma, that the loss of LEA.135 expression is associated with aggressive phenotype of cancer cells during the breast cancer progression, and that its continued expression seems to override the adverse effects of expression of an oncogene or cell proliferation-associated molecules."

However, its role in tumor progression is relatively unclear, especially in breast carcinoma (BC). This study investigated the clinicopathological significance of OTOR in breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) with high metastasis to uncover its biological function in BC. OTOR was highly overexpressed in BC tissues and cells compared with normal samples. OTOR overexpression was associated with certain clinicopathological characteristics and poorer prognosis (overall survival; OS) of patients with breast IDC. As determined using CCK-8, colony formation, wound-healing, and Transwell assays, silencing OTOR using siRNA impeded BC-cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness, which may have resulted from inactivating the mitogen-activated protein kinase - extracellular-signal-regulated kinase pathway. These results indicate that OTOR plays a crucial role in the progression of and prognosis for BC, which could help to identify future therapeutic targets for treating BC patients."

The samples consisted of 185 breasts from random autopsies, 63 cancer-containing breasts, and 44 breasts contralateral to cancer-containing breasts. The method permits the identification and enumeration of essentially all of the dysplastic, hyperplastic, and neoplastic lesions present in each breast. Emphasis was on the prevalence within each sample category of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), and epithelial proliferative lesions with severe atypia, previously termed ALA 4 and ALB 4, which correspond to the clinicopathologic entities atypical ductal hyperplasia and atypical lobular hyperplasia, respectively. Additional primary foci of DCIS (unrelated to invasive breast carcinoma, if present) were found in 52.5 per cent of cancer-containing breasts, and were seen in 47.7 per cent of contralateral and 5.9 per cent of the breasts from random autopsies. Lobular carcinoma in situ was generally seen only in association with infiltrating carcinoma, usually of the ductal type. No LCIS was seen in the breasts from random autopsies. These trends are the same if the proliferative lesions with severe atypia are included with carcinoma in situ. The numbers of lesions were also markedly greater in affected cancer-associated breasts than in affected breasts obtained from autopsies. These findings suggest that LCIS, although a rare lesion in the general population, may be a significant marker for clinical carcinoma. They support previous studies showing a small percentage of women with undetected DCIS of uncertain clinical and biological potential. The multicentric nature of preinvasive breast carcinoma is further substantiated. Finally, when the prevalence and number of lesions are considered in association with the ages of the patients, the lower prevalence of such lesions in the older patients in each sample suggests that at least some DCIS and LCIS may be dependent on a premenopausal hormonal milieu for their continuing existence."

The aim of this study was to examine the expression of three steroid receptor coactivators, along with progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor in meningiomas. This additional regulatory layer may explain the heterogeneity of hormone responses observed in these tumors.

The expression of SRC-1 and TIF2 is significantly related to progesterone but not to estrogen receptor expression. In contrast, seven normal brain specimens were positive for TIF2 and SRC-1 but negative for AIB1. One leptomeningeal specimen was positive for AIB1, SRC-1, and progesterone receptor.

This study included 1019 women aged 20-71 years from the Ontario site of the Breast Cancer Family Registry who had at least one first-degree relative diagnosed with breast and/or ovarian cancer. Information was obtained from a self-administered questionnaire completed at the time of recruitment and a follow-up telephone questionnaire. The associations between breast screening behaviors and perceived risk of developing breast cancer, measured on both a numerical and Likert-type verbal scale, were estimated using logistic regression analyses. Women who rated their risk of developing breast cancer as greater than 50% compared with less than 50% were significantly more likely to have a screening mammogram within the last 12 months (odds ratio: 1.91; 95% confidence interval: 1.15-3.16). Women were significantly more likely to have a screening mammogram (odds ratio: 1.82; 95% confidence interval: 1.17-2.81) in the past 12 months if they rated their risk as above or much above average compared with same as average or below. These findings may inform educational messages for improving risk communication of women at elevated familial breast cancer risk."

Our aim was to assess PBS appearance by means of a structured questionnaire and to look into possible associations to disease and treatment parameters, in 105 women with breast cancer treated by mastectomy. PBS was recorded in 22.9% of the patients. In the majority of cases phantom experience had the size (88.9%), shape (76.5%) and weight (64.7%) of the normal breast and was localised in the entire breast (50%). Concerning disease parameters, no association with primary tumour size (T) or lymph node status was detected, but interestingly, in situ breast cancer (DCIS) was found to be more frequently associated with PBS, compared with invasive tumours. No significant associations of PBS with previous sensory experiences of the breast, radiotherapy or systemic treatment were assessed. The results are interpreted within the frame of Melzack's theory of a neuromatrix, assuming that PBS represents the continued existence, even after amputation, of a sensory engram of the breast. The absence of infiltration in primary tumour histology, probably through an unknown pathophysiological mechanism, might play a role for the significantly higher incidence of PBS in women undergoing mastectomy for DCIS."

Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to examine the average amount of support from four main sources: partner, family, friends, and others. Women perceived more support from the partner than from any other source. Family members provided more affective support than friends or others. Friends provided more affirmation than family or others. After the partner, women reported confiding about their illness more to health care providers, counselors, or religious personnel than family or friends. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for the amount of support from each source and the measures of individual, dyadic, or family adjustment. In general, affect, affirmation, and reciprocity from both the partner and family were associated with less depression, higher marital quality, and better family functioning."

The expression of transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) 1, TAP2, and HLA class I antigens in breast carcinoma lesions was significantly associated with tumor grading. Like normal mammary tissue, the 16 low-grade (G1) breast carcinoma lesions showed strong staining for TAP1, TAP2, and HLA class I antigens. In contrast, only 12 (32%) of 37 high-grade (G2 and G3) breast carcinoma lesions displayed the normal staining pattern. In 14 (38%) of 37 high-grade lesions, HLA class I antigen down-regulation was observed without loss of low molecular mass polypeptide and/or TAP staining. Congruent down-regulation of HLA class I antigen and TAP1 or TAP2 was found in 8 (22%) of 37 high-grade lesions. Complete loss of HLA class I antigens, TAP1, and TAP2 was observed in 3 (8%) of 37 high-grade lesions. No lesion was negative for TAP1 and/or TAP2 staining while positive for HLA class I antigen staining. These data demonstrate an association of HLA class I antigen and TAP down-regulation with tumor progression in breast carcinoma. This association suggests that loss of HLA and/or TAP may represent an escape from the host's immune pressure or may reflect the accumulation of abnormalities associated with neoplastic progression. This accumulation of defects in antigen processing and presentation may in turn be responsible for reduced recognition of malignant cells by putative clinically relevant tumor-specific T cells."

HA expression is frequently increased in malignant tumors, whereas its association with the invasive potential and patient outcome in breast cancer has not been reported. The localization and signal intensity of HA was analyzed in 143 paraffin-embedded tumor samples of human breast carcinoma using a biotinylated HA-specific probe. In the immediate peritumoral stroma, HA signal was moderately or strongly increased in 39% and 56% of the cases, respectively. Normal ductal epithelium showed no HA, whereas in 57% of the tumors at least some of the carcinoma cells were HA positive. The intensity of the stromal HA signal and the presence of cell-associated HA were both significantly related to poor differentiation of the tumors, axillary lymph node positivity, and short overall survival of the patients. In Cox's multivariate analysis, both the intensity of stromal HA signal alone and that combined with the HA positivity in tumor cells were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. These results suggest that HA is directly involved in the spreading of breast cancer and may offer a potential target for new therapies."

All the 158 women (159 tumours) were treated with breast conserving surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for cath-D was seen in carcinoma cells in 47% and in stromal cells in 44%. Nearly all tumours expressed uPA and PAI-1, which were categorized to cytoplasmic expression in carcinoma cells and diffuse stromal expression and quantified -/+/++/ and further dichotomized for purposes of analysis. Expression of uPA and PAI-1 in stromal fibroblasts was recorded as -/+. Cytoplasmic and stromal cell cath-D contents were associated with grade, proliferation, Tn-C expression in the tumour invasion border and the development of distant metastasis. In multivariate analysis stromal cath-D proved to be an independent prognostic factor for metastasis. Stromal expression of uPA was associated with an increased risk of local recurrence; otherwise high levels of uPA did not associate with other prognostic factors nor with prognosis. Fibroblastic expression of PAI-1 showed an association with both local and distant disease recurrence. However, no consistent association between the immunohistochemically quantified uPA and PAI-1 and prognosis was found. In conclusion, immunohistochemical determination of cath-D seems to be a viable method to predict a higher risk of metastasis but not local recurrence in small axillary node-negative breast carcinomas."

We here wanted to explore the significance of vascular endothelial cell proliferation in breast carcinoma. We examined microvessel proliferation in breast cancer by dual immunohistochemical staining, using the pan-endothelial marker Factor-VIII combined with proliferation of endothelial cells by Ki-67 expression, in three independent series of breast cancer, including a total of 499 patients and 141 events during follow-up. Common statistical tests of associations as well as univariate and multivariate regression analysis of patient survival were used. By counting vessels with actively proliferating endothelium, we show that microvascular proliferation is a significant predictor of disease progression in breast cancer, especially among high-grade and ER-negative tumors. Our findings indicate that this novel marker of active tumor angiogenesis might be of value in patient management and should be further studied in the context of patient selection for anti-angiogenesis treatment."

Whereas early stage patients have high likelihood of cure, only 20-40% of patients with metastatic breast carcinoma respond to presently available chemotherapy. A need exists to identify the underlying biological subsets of morphologically similar carcinomas in order to develop customized therapies for patients who require chemotherapy. The HER-2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in 15-30% of breast carcinomas, and is associated with a worse prognosis stage-for-stage. Humanized monoclonal antibody therapy (Herceptin; Genentech Co.) appears to benefit this subset of patients by improving their response rate and survival following anthracycline- or taxane-based chemotherapeutic regimens. Both HER-2 gene amplification and protein overexpression correlate with clinical outcomes, and screening for HER-2 gene amplification appears to be the more informative test.
