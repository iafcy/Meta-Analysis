Nine patients with diagnosed breast cancer who developed
meningiomas are reported. Articles suggesting that an asso-
ciation of these two tumors is possible, Some authors have
noted hormonal sensivity and the presence of hormonal re-
ceptors in some meningiomas. Since breast cancer is the me-

st common tumor in women, an association between it and
meningiomas might be fortuitous. However, it is important to
fUlly investigate brain lesions in patients with breast cancer
so that potentially curable meningiomas are not considered
as metastases,
Table 1 - Site of occurrence of 263 meningiomas in female pa-
tients
Brain metastases are found in 37% to 57% of breast
cancer patients at autopsy": meningiomas overall con-
stitute 20% of all brain tumors. Burns et a1.3 found that
for every case of meningioma in patients with breast
cancer, 54 had metastatic disease as the cause of their
intracranial mass, Schoenberg et a1.21, in an epidemiolo-
gic study of CNS neoplasms and primary malignancies
in other sites from the Connecticut Tumor Registry,
suggested that in the case of breast carcinoma and me-
ningioma the number of observed second primary tu-
mors exceeded the number expected (8 observed cases
vs 3.7 expected cases, P<0.05). However, Schoenberg
et a1.21 based the conclusions on a small number of ca-
ses (n=8) and comparisons of many tumor combina-
tions. The association has been pointed out by Posner"
(study on 324 cases) and by other authors in individual
Breast cancer is a common neoplasm in women, ac-
counting for 28% of all cancers2•23• Likewise, meningio-
mas are common benign neoplasms encountered twice
as often in women as in men. In 1975, an association
between these two tumors was suggested by Schoen-
berg et a1.21• Rubistein et a1.20 reviewed numerous arti-
cles suggesting that an association of the two neoplasms
is more common than expected, The occurrence of 9 su-
ch neoplasms in our Division over a 14-year period
prompted the study,
Materials and methods
Between 1980 and 1993,263 women with meningio-
mas were surgically treated in our Division (Table 1),
Twenty of them had additional tumors that included 9
breast cancers, 5 genital cancers, 3 hematopoietic mali-
gnancies, 2 lung cancers and 1 melanoma,
Estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) assays
were carried out on routine sections of breast and me-
ningeal tumors cut from field paraffin blocks. Sections
of breast cancer and meningioma were rehydrated and
initially digested using DNAase for 30 min at 37°C,
followed by incubation with primary monoclonal anti-
bodies direct against ER and PRo All breast cancers we-
re positive for ER, whereas only 2 were positive for PRo
All meningeal tumors were negative for ER and 4 were
positive for PRo
Breast cancer and meningiomas were classified and
graded according to the WHO classification. The clini-
cal and histologic characteristics and outcome of the 9
patients are reported in Table 2,

reported cases6.1J.J3.16.17.20.21.23. However, in larger menin-
gioma series7.12.18.25 there was no mention of concurrent
breast carcinoma and meningioma.
Both tumors occur in a similar age group (5th-6th de-
cade). Onset and types of neurologic symptoms and si-
gns cannot be used to distinguish between metastatic
breast carcinoma and intracranial meningioma because

omputerized tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful (Ta-
ble 3). The following findings are very important: on
CT scan, metastasis of the breast is outward expansion
of the gray/white matter junction rather than inward
buckling by the extracranial meningioma; abundant sur-
rounding cerebral edema is present with metastasis,
whereas this is not common with meningioma; bone de-
struction, rather than hyperostosis, is suggestive of me-
tastasis; on enhanced MRI meningiomas undergo inten-
se enhancement with a small amount of linear enhance-
ment along the dura adjacent to the tumor ("tail").
Previous studies have suggested an association becau-
se both are ER and PR positive in a high percentage of
cases, both would appear to be hormone dependent for
their development and growth, and both have been mani-
fested as collision tumors, in which the breast carcinoma
has metastasized to the meningioma. Many authors 4.5.10
have recently documented that the ER\PR profile menin-
gioma substantially differs from that customarily seen in
breast cancer; unlike breast cancer, meningiomas are mu-
ch more commonly positive for PR than for ER. Kozbor
and Croce" reported that amplification of the c-myc on-
cogene may be induced in both tumors; however, the c-
myc oncogene is enhanced several-fold on exposure to
estrogen. The human PR gene shares the same location
as the mammary oncogene int-2 in chromosomal band
llq1315. Such a proximity is believed to explain the role
of progesterone in breast cancer, but the role of oncoge-
ne, int-2 in the genesis of meningiomas is not yet known.

meningioma was found on the sphenoidal ridge. Com-
pared with all meningioma patients (263 cases), those
with breast cancer were more likely to have sphenoidal
ridge meningiomas (67% vs 11%; P=O.36). All breast
cancers were positive for ER, whereas only 2 were po-
sitive for PRo Our meningiomas were negative for ER,
whereas 4 sphenoidal meningiomas were positive for
PRo Such data confirmed the different ER\PR profile of
tumors and the hypothesis that sphenoidal ridge menin-
gioma and breast cancer may represent a unique con-
stellation of neoplasms in women".
