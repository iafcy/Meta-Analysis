Association of tamoxifen with meningioma: a
population-based study in Sweden
Jianguang Jia, Jan Sundquista,b and Kristina Sundquista,b
Previous studies suggest that hormone therapy may play an
important role in the development of meningioma. However,
it is unclear whether medication with tamoxifen can prevent
meningioma. Our study cohort included all women who
were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1961 and 2010,
and a total of 227 535 women were identified with breast
cancer with a median age at diagnosis of 63 years. Women
diagnosed with breast cancer after 1987 were defined as
tamoxifen exposed; those diagnosed with breast cancer
before or during 1987 were defined as not exposed to
tamoxifen. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used
to calculate the risk of subsequent meningioma. Of these
women, 223 developed meningioma. For women without
tamoxifen exposure, the risk of meningioma was
significantly increased, with an SIR of 1.54 (95% confidence
interval 1.30–1.81); the risk was not increased in those with
tamoxifen exposure (SIR = 1.06, 95% confidence interval
0.84–1.32). The increased risk of meningioma in women
without tamoxifen exposure persisted during 10 years of
follow-up. In this historical cohort study, we found that
women diagnosed with breast cancer but not treated with
tamoxifen had an increased incidence of meningioma,
whereas the incidence was close to that of the general
population in patients treated with tamoxifen. This suggests
that tamoxifen may prevent the development of
meningioma. European Journal of Cancer Prevention

Introduction
Meningioma is a common tumour in the central nervous
system, and it accounts for 13–26% of all intracranial
tumours (Barnholtz-Sloan and Kruchko, 2007; Wiemels
et al., 2010). The only known risk factor for meningioma
is ionizing radiation (Preston et al., 2002; El Ghissassi
et al., 2009); other environmental and lifestyle risk factors
show inconclusive results (Barnholtz-Sloan and Kruchko,
2007; Wiemels et al., 2010). Given the higher prevalence
of meningioma in women than in men (ratio 2 : 1) (Hsu
et al., 1997; Carroll et al., 2000; Claus et al., 2008), it was
hypothesized that hormones may be a risk factor for
meningioma. Its association with hormones was further
supported by evidence from women receiving hormone
replacement therapy, who were found to have an
increased risk of meningioma (Claus et al., 2007; Benson
et al., 2010; Korhonen et al., 2012). A possible association
was also observed among women using oral contra-
ceptives (Custer et al., 2006; Claus et al., 2007; Korhonen
et al., 2010), and pregnancy and menopausal status were
reported to influence the risk of meningioma (Lambe
et al., 1997; Wigertz et al., 2008). Women diagnosed with
breast cancer have an increased risk of meningioma and
vice versa (Custer et al., 2002; Rao et al., 2009). Some
studies confirmed the expression of oestrogen receptors
in some meningiomas (Black et al., 1996; Carroll et al.,
1999; Claus et al., 2008).
All the above observations suggest that oestrogen may
play an important role in the development of menin-
gioma. It is thus important to examine whether medica-
tion with tamoxifen, a selective oestrogen receptor
modulator with an antioestrogenic effect (Al-Mubarak
et al., 2014; Nazarali and Narod, 2014), can inhibit or
prevent the development of meningioma. Tamoxifen has
been used widely to treat patients with oestrogen
receptor-positive breast cancer (Al-Mubarak et al., 2014;
Nazarali and Narod, 2014), and was first used in Sweden
in the late 1980s (Fornander et al., 1989; Chandanos et al.,
2006). To study its influence on the development of
meningioma, we tested in this study whether women
diagnosed with breast cancer and treated with tamoxifen
have a lower incidence of meningioma compared with
women without tamoxifen treatment using a nationwide
population-based cohort study.
Methods
This historical cohort study was approved by the
Regional Ethical Review Board of Lund University,
Sweden, in 2013 (Diarienummer 2012/795). Patients
diagnosed with breast cancer during the period 1 January
1961 to 31 December 2010 were identified from the
Swedish Cancer Registry. The Swedish Cancer Registry
was founded in 1958, and has had nationwide coverage
since 1961. The Swedish Cancer Registry is currently

estimated to have close to 100% coverage at the national
level (Hemminki et al., 2010). It is maintained by the
National Board of Health and Welfare. In Sweden, all
clinicians and pathologists/cytologists are obliged to
report all newly diagnosed primary cancers to the Cancer
Registry. A validation study showed that 99% of the
recorded
cancer
cases
are
morphologically
verified
(Hemminki et al., 2010). Only primary tumours are
recorded in this register; metastases are excluded.
Women with breast cancer were identified from the
Swedish Cancer Registry using the ICD-7 code 170.
Only patients with a first primary breast cancer were
included; patients with a previous cancer, including
breast cancer, were excluded.
All the patients in our cohort were followed until the
diagnosis of meningioma, which was identified from the
Swedish Cancer Registry using the ICD-7 code 1930.
Histological confirmation was determined using the
pathological anatomic diagnostic codes 461, 465 and 466.
These codes were used during the entire study period.
Additional linkages were made to the Swedish National
Population
and
Housing
Census
(Population
and
Housing Census 1960–1990, 2011) to obtain information
on individual-level characteristics, such as year of birth
and sex; to the Cause of Death Register to identify date
of death; and to the Emigration Registry to identify date
of emigration. All linkages were performed using indivi-
dual
national
identification
numbers,
which
were
replaced with serial numbers to preserve anonymity.
We calculated person-years at risk for our cohort from the
date of diagnosis of first primary breast cancer to the
earliest of the following: date of diagnosis of meningioma,
death, emigration and end of the study period (31
December 2010). We estimated the risk of meningioma
in our cohort using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs),
which were calculated as the ratio of the observed to
expected numbers of cases (Breslow and Day, 1987;
Rothman and Greenland, 1998). The expected number
of cases was calculated by multiplying the observed
person-years at risk by the incidence rate of meningioma
for all individuals without a diagnosis of primary breast
cancer. SIRs were standardized by 5-year age group and
5-year time interval. For the SIRs, 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated assuming a Poisson dis-
tribution and rounded to two decimal places (Esteve
et al., 1994). To exclude surveillance bias, all meningio-
mas diagnosed within 1 year of follow-up after the pri-
mary breast cancer were excluded. As tamoxifen has
been used widely in Sweden since the late 1980s, we
defined patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer before
the end of December 1987 (years 1961–1997) as not
exposed to tamoxifen and those diagnosed with breast
cancer in 1988–2010 as tamoxifen exposed. As this study
is a nationwide study with a total of 227 535 patients with
breast cancer, we have 100% power to detect an
increasing prevalence of tamoxifen between the two
cohorts on the basis of the assumption that the pre-
valence of tamoxifen was 5 and 50% before and after the
year 1987, respectively.
In our exposure definition, all the patients diagnosed
with breast cancer in 1988–2000 were defined as being
tamoxifen exposed, which may lead to misclassification
of exposure. In particular, only those breast cancer
patients with ER+ could be treated with tamoxifen, and
around 85% could be diagnosed with ER+ according to
the published literature (Ferno et al., 2000). We thus
calculated the adjusted risk ratio on the basis of the fol-
lowing formula:
1:06 ¼1:54 1percentage of misclassification
ð
Þ
þpercentage of misclassificationadjusted risk ratio:
We assumed that all the patients with ER−will not be
treated with tamoxifen, and they will have the same
incidence as those breast cancer patients diagnosed
before 1988 (SIR = 1.56). All analyses were carried out
using SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, North
Carolina, USA).

women without tamoxifen exposure (diagnosed between
1961 and 1987) was 98 681; 128 854 women (diagnosed
between 1988 and 2010) had tamoxifen exposure. A total
of 145 meningiomas were found in women without
tamoxifen exposure and 78 meningiomas were found in
women with tamoxifen exposure.
The risk of meningioma in our cohort is presented in
Table 2 according to tamoxifen exposure status. For
women without tamoxifen exposure, the risk of menin-
gioma was significantly increased, with an SIR of 1.54
(95% CI 1.30–1.81). By contrast, the risk of meningioma
was not increased in women with tamoxifen treatment
(SIR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.84–1.32). The risk of meningioma
was further analysed by follow-up interval and age at
diagnosis of breast cancer. For women without tamoxifen
exposure, the increased risk of meningioma can persist
for 10 years after the first breast cancer, and the risk was
increased for women diagnosed with breast cancer before
50 years and after 59 years. In addition, we calculated the
risk of meningioma among breast cancer patients diag-
nosed between 1988 and 2000 and those between 2001
and 2010, separately. The SIR was 1.08 (N = 55, 95% CI
0.81–1.41) for those diagnosed between 1988 and 2000
and 1.01 (N = 23, 95% CI 0.64–1.51) for those diagnosed
between 2001 and 2010.
In Table 3, we present the adjusted risk ratio on the basis
of the percentage of misclassification of exposure. The
adjusted risk ratio decreased with an increased percen-
tage of misclassification of exposure. The risk ratio was
1.01 when misclassification of exposure was 10%.
Discussion
In this historical population-based cohort study, we
identified a total of 227 535 women diagnosed with breast
cancer during 1961–2010. The main finding is that the
incidence of meningioma was significantly increased in
women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1961 and
1987, when tamoxifen was not used for the treatment of
breast cancer in Sweden. In addition, we found that the
incidence of meningioma in women diagnosed with
breast cancer during 1988–2010, when tamoxifen was
used widely in Sweden, was close that in the general
population, suggesting that tamoxifen may prevent the
development of meningioma.
The increased risk of meningioma in women diagnosed
with breast cancer before 1987 is in agreement with a few
previous reports (Markopoulos et al., 1998; Malmer et al.,
2000; Custer et al., 2002; Rao et al., 2009). One Swedish
study found the relative risk of meningioma to be around
1.6 after the diagnosis of breast cancer (Malmer et al.,
2000). Another study in the USA using the Washington
State Cancer Registry found that the risk of meningioma
in women with breast cancer and the risk of breast cancer
in women with meningioma were increased (Custer et al.,
2002). One subsequent study confirmed the observed
association between meningioma and breast cancer in
women, but not in men (Rao et al., 2009). The strong
association between meningioma and breast cancer sug-
gests that the two tumour types share aetiological factors.
One explanation for the increased incidence of menin-
gioma after breast cancer could be related to the radiation
and
chemotherapy
used
to
treat
primary
cancers.
However, the observed increase in the risk of menin-
gioma in our study persisted for 10 years of follow-up.
This suggests that the treatment effect may only play a
small
role
because
therapeutic
effects
are
usually
observed in the late follow-up period instead of the initial
follow-up period (Ji and Hemminki, 2006). Another
explanation is that the two primary cancers share genetic
or environmental risk factors. However, a previous study
suggests that the contribution of BCRA1 and BCRA2
mutations to the development of meningioma is minimal
(Kirsch et al., 1997). On the basis of our discussion above,
the
strong
association
between
breast
cancer
and
meningiomas may be related to oestrogen, which could
contribute to the development of these two types of
tumour.
Women with breast cancer have been treated with
tamoxifen since the late 1980s in Sweden (Rutqvist,
2004), and the prognosis has been found to be markedly
improved
among
patients
with
oestrogen
receptor-
positive tumours. In addition, many studies have exam-
ined the effectiveness of tamoxifen in preventing breast
cancer (Freedman et al., 2003; Kramer and Brown, 2004).
It was found that administration of tamoxifen to women

daily for 5 years can reduce their risk of developing breast
cancer by about one-half (Freedman et al., 2003; Kramer
and Brown, 2004). However, it is not known whether
tamoxifen can prevent the development of meningioma,
although oestrogen may play an important role in the
development of meningioma.
In this study, we found that the incidence of meningioma
in breast cancer patients diagnosed after 1987 and treated
with tamoxifen was close to that in the general popula-
tion. To our knowledge, no previous study has examined
whether tamoxifen can inhibit the development of
meningioma. Our data suggest that tamoxifen may inhi-
bit the development of meningioma, which may be
helpful for individuals at high risk of meningioma, such
as those with neurofibromatosis type 2 gene (NF2)
mutations: mutations in the NF2 gene may account for
half of all meningioma cases (Simon et al., 2007). Two
small studies explored the effect of tamoxifen treatment
on meningioma, but the results were inconclusive
(Markwalder et al., 1985; Goodwin et al., 1993). A study
by Markwalder et al. (1985) in which six meningioma
patients were treated with tamoxifen found no significant
improvement in tumour growth. Another study by
Goodwin et al. (1993), based on 21 patients with non-
resectable refractory meningiomas, did not recommend
the use of tamoxifen in refractory meningioma.
The present study has some important strengths. First, all
primary breast cancers and subsequent meningiomas
were identified from the Swedish Cancer Registry, which
has high quality and nationwide coverage. Diagnostic bias
is unlikely because the Swedish Cancer Registry is based
on the compulsory clinical reports provided by physicians,
pathologists, and cytologists, ensuring diagnostic accuracy
at the national level. In addition, this study is a nation-
wide study and enough patients were included to ensure
reliable risk estimates. The prospective study design and
the completeness of the follow-up of patients are other
major advantages of the present study.
One major limitation of this study is that data on medi-
cation with tamoxifen in our cohort at the individual level
were lacking, and we defined tamoxifen exposure by year
of diagnosis of breast cancer on the basis of evidence that
tamoxifen has been used widely in Sweden since the late
1980s. However, such a definition may have led to non-
differential
misclassification
of
tamoxifen
exposure,
thereby diluting the true observations and biasing our
results
towards
the
null.
The
adjusted
risk
ratio
decreased with an increased percentage of misclassifica-
tion (Table 3), providing further evidence that non-
differential misclassification will bias our results towards
the null. The use of tamoxifen was infrequent in Sweden
before 1990, but increased continuously during the 1990s
(Kemetli et al., 2009). In 2005, the proportion of operable
breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant endocrine
therapy was around 60–80%, although the prevalence
varied somewhat depending on the age at diagnosis
(Kemetli et al., 2009). In addition, treatment with tamox-
ifen at the beginning lasted only for 2 years, and then
increased to 5 years (Ferno et al., 2000). The increased
prevalence and time for the treatment of breast cancer with
tamoxifen suggest that the risk of meningioma could be
varied depending on the time period. Indeed, our study
found that the risk of meningioma was somewhat higher
among those patients diagnosed between 1988 and 2000
compared with those between 2001 and 2010, further
supporting the evidence that treatment with tamoxifen
may decrease the risk of meningioma. It is known that the
therapy and diagnosis of meningioma have changed during
the study period, but the SIR in this study was adjusted for
the time period, which can minimize the confounding
effect. In addition, adjuvant chemotherapy for breast can-
cer has also increased during the study period (Kemetli
et al., 2009), but no evidence suggests that adjuvant che-
motherapy could protect against the development of
meningioma. The mortality of breast cancer has decreased
continuously during the past decades (Schopper and De
Wolf, 2009), but the risk of meningioma could be higher
among women with low mortality because of the long
duration of follow-up compared with those with high
mortality. Data on individual-level risk factors such as
alcohol consumption, smoking and dietary factors were
lacking, which may have partly confounded our conclusion.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that these factors
are associated with meningioma, which suggests that their
effects are minimal.
Conclusion
Women diagnosed with breast cancer who were not
treated with tamoxifen had an increased risk of menin-
gioma, suggesting that the two types of tumour may share
aetiological factors such as oestrogen. By contrast, the
incidence of meningioma in women with breast cancer
who were treated with tamoxifen was close to that in the
general population, which suggests that tamoxifen may
prevent the development of meningioma.
