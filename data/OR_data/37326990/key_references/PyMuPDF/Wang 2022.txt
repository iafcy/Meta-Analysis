ABSTRACT
Objective: Benign spinal intradural tumors are rare entities and there have been relatively few case series
describing the epidemiology and characteristics of these tumors. Here, we evaluate the presentation,
demographics, pathology and outcomes associated with the surgical management of spinal meningioma
in our unit over a 6-year period.
Results: A total of 68 cases presented to the operating surgeon during a 6-year period. Of these, over
80% (n ¼ 55) were in females. Seventy-nine percent of the meningiomas were observed in the thoracic
region (n ¼ 54). Weakness and gait disturbance were the most common presenting complaints. Surgery
significantly improved both motor outcome (p < 0.001) and health related qualities of life (SF36, p < 0.01).
Results: Seventeen percent of spinal meningioma cases (n ¼ 12) had a preceding cancer diagnosis. Of
these 75% (n ¼ 9/12) were attributable to breast cancer. Overall, breast cancer preceded a diagnosis of a
spinal meningioma in 16.4% of female cases (9/55). This is higher than expected number of breast cancer
based on UK population and those reported in literature for breast cancer and intracranial meningioma.
Conclusion: Spinal meningioma is disproportionately over-represented in females. Patients present with
neurological deficits and surgery improved both neurology and patient reported quality of life. Relative to
the known UK prevalence of breast cancer, there is a significantly higher than expected association
between spinal meningioma and a preceding history of breast cancer.

Introduction
Benign intraspinal tumors are rare entities with a reported inci-
dence of around 0.7 per 100,000 per year in the USA,1 although
there are substantial variations in the reported incidence and dis-
tribution across different series.1–3 Spinal meningioma accounts
for 20%–40% of all intradural extramedullary tumors and exhib-
its a known female predominance.3–5 The typical ratio of female
to male patients at presentation is four to one.3,6,7 Scattered case
series have been published describing the epidemiology and treat-
ment of these tumors. Most published series, since the advent of
microsurgery, have included relatively small number of patients.
Surgery is thought to be the treatment of choice for most
patients, with complete resection (Simpson Grade I and II)
thought to offer the best long-term prognosis.6,8–11 Even in older
populations (over 70 years old) with a substantial neurological
deficit,
surgery
still
offers
a
high
chance
of
neuro-
logical recovery.12
Other organ malignancies such as breast cancer have been
associated with intracranial meningiomas.13–15 No such associ-
ation has been reported with spinal meningioma to date. Here,
we describe our single-surgeon experience on management of
spinal meningioma within a tertiary neurosurgical unit in UK.
We describe a previously unreported association between hormo-
nal receptor positive breast carcinoma and spinal meningioma.
Methods
Study design
Prospective collection of data relating to all cases of spinal intra-
dural tumors has been in place in our unit since 1 January 2014.
Patient demographics (age and gender), tumor type, location and
operative management were prospectively recorded in this data-
base. Additional retrospective analysis on all patients over a
6-year period, from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2019 was
performed for this study with subset analysis of patients with spi-
nal meningiomas. Database maintenance was performed by a
dedicated member of staff (AH).
All patients were seen and assessed in clinic after diagnosis,
where patients’ symptoms on presentation and associated neuro-
logical deficit were recorded. Those patients who subsequently
underwent surgery were then followed-up at 6 weeks by a spinal
physiotherapist and at 3 months and beyond by the senior
author. In addition to a 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36)

questionnaire, patients’ local and radiating pain was measured
according to the Neuropathic Pain Score (NPS).16 The MRC
grading of muscle strength in the most affected limb, their walk-
ing ability as per the gait section of the Japanese Orthopedic
Association’s evaluation system for low back pain syndrome
(JOA
score),17
the
most
significant
presenting
symptoms,
patient’s past medical history and Charlson Comorbidity Indices
were also recorded.18
Further telephonic consultations of patients with previous his-
tory of malignancy were carried out. Data pertaining to the pre-
cise
diagnosis,
grading,
staging
and
treatment
received
were documented.
Statistics
All statistics were performed through the Python statistics mod-
ule (SciPy Stats), using the chi-squared test of independence for
comparison of the MRC motor score in the most affected limb
and JOA gait score; Student’s t-test for the NPS. A probability of
lower than 1 in 20 (p ¼ 0.05) was considered to represent statis-
tical significance.
The probability of an association between meningioma and a
prior diagnosis of breast cancer was estimated with a chi-squared
test for independence. The expected probability, assuming that
breast cancer is independent from meningioma, was constructed
from MacMillan cancer prevalence data (Macmillan-NCRAS can-
cer prevalence project),19 the Central Brain Tumor Registry of
the USA3 and the UK census.20 For detailed methods, see
Supplementary materials.
Systematic review of literature
The systematic review was performed following the PRISMA
guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analysis).21 The review protocol was registered with inter-
national registration database PROSPERO (Registration Number
CRD42020161361). No ethical approval and patient consent were
required. A literature search was performed to identify the
English language publications that addressed the association
between breast cancer and meningioma. The detailed literature

Results
Characteristics of spinal meningioma and
treatment outcome
Over a 6-year period, a total of 258 patients presented with intra-
spinal tumors to our unit, including 68 patients with spinal men-
ingiomas (Table 1), 108 patients with nerve sheath tumors and
33 ependymomas. Spinal meningiomas were the primary focus of
this current paper and within this subset most patients were
female (55) with a mean age of presentation 72.5 (±12.5) years
old. Meningiomas were most commonly encountered within the
thoracic spine (54 patients). Three patients were treated expect-
antly with radiological monitoring and did not undergo a surgi-
cal intervention.
Pre-operatively, the median Charlson comorbidity index was 3
(77% estimated 10-year survival). The most common presenting
symptom was weakness (38.5%), followed by pain (26.9%). The
median power in the most affected limb was MRC grade 4. The
mean pre-op NPS was 25.5 out of 100. Daily activities were com-
monly affected: the median pre-op JOA gait score was 1 (unable
to walk further than 500 m). At the time of diagnosis, the
patient’s quality of life as per the SF-36 questionnaire was
severely compromised (mean score 17.5  52.3 across different
aspects of the SF-36 score).
Surgical resection of the spinal meningioma significantly
improved all patient parameters assessed. Weakness improved in
35 patients and worsened in 2 patients only. The median MRC
motor score in the most affected limb post-op improved to 5
(p < 0.001, chi-squared test of independence); mean NPS was
15.8 out of 100 (p ¼ 0.002, Student’s t-test); median JOA gait
score was 2 (p ¼ 0.002, chi-squared test of independence). With
these improvements, all eight aspects of SF-36 quality of life
score improved significantly (Table 2).
Incidence of concurrent breast cancer in patients diagnosed
with meningioma
A preceding history of breast cancer was observed in 9 of 55
female patients with spinal meningiomas. In the absence of a
control population for direct comparison, over 16% of our case
series had a diagnosis of breast cancer, which is significantly
higher proportion than would be expected from established
matched prevalence data for the UK (expected prevalence of
4.98%, p < 0.001). In addition, out of the 41 female patients diag-
nosed with nerve sheath tumors in our series, only 3 patients
had a prior diagnosis of breast cancer (7.32%, p ¼ 0.01), signifi-
cantly less than those with spinal meningiomas.
Of the nine patients, eight had estrogen receptor positive
breast cancers, four cases of invasive ductal carcinoma, two cases
of invasive lobular carcinoma and one nonspecific invasive

carcinoma. The mean age of diagnosis of their breast cancer was
61.8 years and the mean time between the two diagnoses (breast
cancer to meningioma) was 8.98 years. All eight patients were
treated surgically for their breast cancer, followed by radiother-
apy in seven patients and hormonal therapy for all eight patients,
and all were in remission by the time of their spinal meningioma
diagnosis (Table 3). The other patient had high-grade ductal car-
cinoma in situ (DCIS) and received surgical treatment only. The
location of these nine meningioma was spread out across neuro-
axis (C1 to T11).
Other visceral malignancies were also observed sporadically
throughout our series. One patient who presented with thoracic
meningioma had a history of pancreatic cancer. In the nerve
sheath tumor patient population, in addition to patients with a
prior diagnosis of breast cancer, there was one patient with a his-
tory of prostate and renal cancer, one with melanoma and one
with caecal carcinoma.
Association of breast cancer and meningioma—review
of literature
To our knowledge, a relationship between breast cancer and spi-
nal meningioma has not previously been reported in the litera-
ture. Although, historically an association between breast cancer
and intracranial meningioma has been observed.13–15,22,55 This
link, however, remains controversial and most of the published
literature is limited to case reports and case series. We performed
a systematic review of literatures according to the PRISMA
protocol to enable comparison between our series and pub-
lished literature.
We identified 44 English language literatures discussing asso-
ciation of breast cancer with meningioma. This included 27 case
reports and 3 case series reporting a total of 38 cases. All patients
were female apart from one where the sex of the patient was not
specified, the mean age is 60 (23–79). Six were reports of co-
existence of breast cancer and meningioma,23–28 whilst the rest
were reports of breast cancer metastasing to existing meningi-
oma.54 Five of the cases were of spinal meningiomas,23,26,29–31
whereas the rest are intracranial meningiomas.
We found 14 population-based cohort studies that addressed
the risk of developing both breast cancer and meningioma. Two
of the articles explicitly compared the prevalence of both diagno-
sis within their cohort against the background population (Table
4).13,14 Custer et al.13 was a study based on the Washington State
cancer registry between 1992 and 1998 which looked at 598
female patients with meningioma and found the 1.83% were
diagnosed with breast cancer following the meningioma diagnosis
(11 patients). The expected number of cases was calculated to be
7.16, giving a relative risk ratio of 1.54 (95% Cl 0.77–2.75). Rao
et al.14 used five American cancer registries between 1995 and
2004 and looked at four separate cohorts. Expected number of
cases was calculated using annual incidence rate. It was found
that of the 6103 females diagnosed with meningioma, 219 then
went onto develop breast cancer, when the expected number was
only 3.77, giving a relative risk of 58 (95% Cl 51–67), which is
several folds higher than those reported elsewhere; however, the
breast cancer cases were recorded during the entire study period
and the expected number did not appear to correct for this.
Three additional articles discussed the relative risk of having
both diagnosis without explicitly discussing the reference data for
background population.32–34 These three studies looked at popu-
lations in Swedish and Norway cancer registry and reported an
increased prevalence of meningioma in breast cancer patients
with a relative risk of 1.57–1.75, and an increased prevalence of
breast cancer within meningioma patients with a relative risk of
1.54. Nine other cohort studies of varying size investigated the
prevalence within their cohorts without discussing how this
would compare against the sporadic rate of both diagnoses.35–43
Discussion
Benign spinal intradural tumors are relatively rare, and studies so
far have been confounded by the small number of patients in
each series. In our unit, we treated 258 patients with spinal intra-
dural tumors over a 6-year period, representing an incidence of
1.5 per 100,000, which is similar to, or slightly higher than, other
reported figures in literature.1,44 The two most common patholo-
gies were nerve sheath tumor (41.9%) and meningioma (26.4%).
The two pathologies represented distinct populations, with men-
ingioma seen in older and predominantly female patients. Most
of our patients with spinal meningiomas were managed surgi-
cally. The slow growing nature of these tumors, and their rarity,
mean that these patients often present insidiously and are fre-
quently initially misdiagnosed. At the time of diagnosis, we
found that patients’ quality of life was severely compromised, as
demonstrated by their SF36 scores. Surgical resection of the spi-
nal meningioma led to improvement in all aspect of outcome
measures, with improvement in neuropathic pain, motor score
and quality of life. In particular regarding muscle strength, most
patients recovered to a power of MRC grade 5 (42 out of 68
patients who had a motor deficit on presentation). With these
improvements, patients’ reported quality of life also increased.
Although different outcome measures are used, our result is in
keeping with published case series.6,8,9,12
Historically, an association between breast cancer and intra-
cranial meningioma has been observed and reported. However,
to our knowledge a relationship between breast cancer and spinal
meningioma has not previously been reported in the literature.

The underlying link remains unknown, however several theories
have been proposed, including a role for hormonal receptors
such as estrogen and progesterone receptors.45–48 The ability to
make an association has most likely been confounded by the fact
that spinal meningioma is a rare entity. In this case series, we
have identified, and reported a significantly increased prevalence
of breast cancer in female patients with spinal meningiomas.
Overall, nine female patients were previously diagnosed with
breast cancer. Out of 55 female patients, this represented a pro-
portion of 16.4%. This is significantly higher than baseline preva-
lence of breast cancer in female population (p < 0.001) after
accounting for age, size of population and incidence of spinal
meningioma, and in direct contrast with the lower rate of breast
cancer within the female patients with nerve sheath tumors
(7.32%). It is difficult, however, to interpret the true significance
of this without comparing our data with established literature.
We therefore performed a systematic review of the English lan-
guage literature. Although there has been a wealth of literature
reporting the association between intracranial meningioma and
breast cancer, most are case reports and case series. We found
five studies looking into the relative risk against a background
population.13,14,32–34 However, only two of these articles directly
discussed the background population used and importantly the
expected rate of disease within the background population.13,14
Both studies extracted data from state cancer registry in the
USA. The Washington study13 looked at the incidence of breast
cancer in meningioma patients (1.84%) over a 6 years period and
vice versa (0.05%) and their expected incidence were calculated
based on 5-year age group specific incidence taking into account
of patient-year at risk, giving a relative risk of 1.54 for developing
breast cancer in meningioma patients. Similarly, Rao et al.14 used
data from five of the state registries, recording an incidence rate
of 3.59% for breast cancer in female meningioma patients and
0.21% for the reverse population over 9 years. However, they cal-
culated their expected incidence from annual incidence rather
than taking into account of the 9 years of the primary data,
which resulted the very high relative risk of 58 for breast cancer
in
meningioma
which
was
several
magnitude
higher
than
reported elsewhere.13,32–34 This most likely demonstrates bias
within this study rather than true risks. Three other studies
found also reported relative risk ratio including two based on
Swedish cancer registry and one of Norway national cancer regis-
try.32–34 These studies, however, did not discuss the background
population used for comparison. The relative risk of developing
meningioma in a breast cancer population was reported as 1.54
and those of breast cancer in meningioma population were
1.57–1.75. Combining the data and excluding the one outlier,14
the relative risk ratio of developing meningioma in patients with
breast cancer were between 1.54 and 1.75,13,32–34 with 1.54 being
the most commonly reported value. Similarly, the relative risk
ratio of developing breast cancers in patients with meningioma
was reported as 1.4 and 1.54. Given these studies used data from
different countries over different time periods and using different
data
recording
method,
this
is
remarkably
consistent.
The
reported prevalence of breast cancer within meningioma popula-
tion was 1.63% to 8.33%. In comparison, in our series of spinal
meningiomas, the prevalence of breast cancer is 16.4% and sub-
stantially higher to those reported in literature for intracra-
nial meningioma.
No mechanistic link between meningioma and breast cancer
has been proven. We note, however, that in our case, series most
patients
had
estrogen
receptor
positive
breast
cancers
and
received
surgery,
radiotherapy
and
hormonal
therapy.

Intracranial meningiomas are thought to be hormone respon-
sive.45,49 This is supported by evidence that women receiving
hormone replacement therapy may be at an increased risk of
intracranial meningioma;47–51 the rapid increase in sizes of men-
ingioma during pregnancy that is sometimes observed and a pos-
sible association with women using oral contraceptives and
meningioma.47,52,53 Intracranial meningiomas have also been
known
to
express
both
estrogen
and
progesterone
recep-
tors.45,46,48 There have been studies linking tamoxifen exposure
to reduced risk of meningioma, however given that in our series
all patients had received hormonal treatment, this link seems to
be less clear. The only demonstrated risk factor to date for intra-
cranial meningioma is ionizing radiation.46–48 Seven of the
patients in our series were treated with radiotherapy. However,
modern radiotherapy is focused on the breast area and the loca-
tion of the spinal meningiomas in these patients were spread
over a much broader area across the neuro-axis including two
high cervical tumors at C1/2, one at C4, two cases at T5, T7 and
T11 each, making a link unlikely. Any such link can only be
rigorously evaluated through a much larger case series, or experi-
mental models of spinal meningioma. In our unit, prospective
data collection involving patients with spinal meningioma and a
concomitant diagnosis of breast cancer remains in situ with a
new pathway set up to analyze hormone receptor profiles of both
tumor types. Given the small number of patients presenting with
this condition, we encourage other neurosurgical units to publish
their own case series so that a larger number of cases can be
examined through meta-analysis and the link between spinal
meningioma and breast cancer confirmed or denied with confi-
dence. Although large-scale screening of breast cancer patients is
unlikely to be cost effective, knowledge of this association should
