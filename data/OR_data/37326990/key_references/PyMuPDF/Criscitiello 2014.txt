Abstract
Background: The etiology of meningioma is largely unknown, although breast cancer has been suggested to
play a role.
Methods: A monoinstitutional, retrospective analysis was performed at European Institute of Oncology on
12,330 patients with breast cancer. The cumulative incidence of meningioma was estimated using the Kaplan–
Meier method and the log-rank test was used to assess differences between groups.
Results: In total, 33 patients with meningioma were identiﬁed from a study population of 12,330, with a 10-
year cumulative incidence of meningioma of 0.37%. We did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly increased risk of
meningioma among patients with breast cancer or an association between the hormonal receptor status and
the risk of meningioma (P ¼ 0.65).
Conclusions: Our results do not support a role of breast cancer or endocrine treatments in meningioma
development.
Impact: This analysis adds new information on a debated topic. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 23(1);

Introduction
Meningiomas are typically benign tumors arising from
the meningothelial cells of the arachnoid membrane cov-
ering the brain and spinal cord. The etiology of meningi-
omas is largely unknown. There is evidence to suggest
that breast cancer may play a role in the development of
meningiomas,
including
the observation
that these
tumors occur more commonly in women (1, 2). Further
evidence for a possible role for hormones in brain tumor
etiology includes the presence of progesterone (PgR),
estrogen (ER), and androgen receptors in some meningi-
omas, suggesting a link between breast cancer and menin-
giomas. Immunohistochemical studies have shown that
about 70% of meningiomas express PgR and about 30%
express ER, thus corroborating the hypothesis that menin-
gioma is a hormone-sensitive tumor (3, 4). Our study was
carried out to explore the possible association between
breast cancer, endocrine therapy, and the risk of devel-
oping meningioma in a large monoinstitutional popula-
tion of patients with breast cancer. We focused on endo-
crine-responsive tumors to ﬁnd a potential link between
these tumors and endocrine therapy.
Materials and Methods
Data from 12,330 women with early-stage breast cancer
who underwent surgery at the European Institute of
Oncology (IEO) in Milan between 1994 and 2011 were
retrieved from two institutional databases: the Breast
Cancer database, which contains information on patients
with breast cancer operated at IEO, and the Tumor Reg-
istry. Patients who received neoadjuvant treatment,
patients with a previous history of cancer, or patients
with metastatic breast cancer at diagnosis were excluded
from the analysis. Breast cancer–related data on age,
menopausal
status,
surgery,
histopathology
(Ki-67
expression, ER/PgR expression, and HER2 status) and
systemic treatment were analyzed. Usually, patients were
followed up with physical examination every 6 months,
annual mammography, breast ultrasound, andblood tests
every 6 to 12 months, and additional evaluations when
clinically indicated. Whenever possible, the health status
of women who did not come back for scheduled follow-up
visits for more than 1 year was obtained by phone contact.
Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective
analysis. The primary endpoint was the cumulative inci-
dence of meningioma (cum-inc ME), calculated from
breast surgery to meningioma diagnosis. The cum-inc ME
was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. The log-
rank test was used to assess differences between groups.
All analyses were carried out with the SAS software 9.3
(SAS Institute).

Results
From January 1994 to December 2011, we identiﬁed a
total of 12,330 consecutive patients with early-stage breast
cancer. At a median follow-up of 7 years, 33 patients with
meningioma were identiﬁed from a study population of
12,330. Table 1 describes selected demographic, clinical,
and pathologic characteristics of the study population at
the time of breast cancer surgery, systemic treatments

administered, number of meningiomas, and 10-year cum-
inc ME. Considering the entire population, the 10-year
cum-inc ME was 0.37% [95% conﬁdence interval (CI),
0.26%–0.55%]. No association was found between ER/
PgR and the risk of meningioma. No association was
found if we matched analysis coupling ER and PgR (P
¼ 0.65) or considering them separately (ER, P ¼ 0.18 and
PgR, P ¼ 0.60). Patients who received aromatase inhibitors
had a trend of higher risk to develop meningioma
compared with patients who received tamoxifen, with
a borderline statistical signiﬁcance (P ¼ 0.054). No other
signiﬁcant association was observed in the analyzed
variables.
Discussion
This large, retrospective study evaluated more than
12,000 patients with breast cancer with an average fol-
low-up period of 7 years, and identiﬁed a total of 33
individuals with an incident case of meningioma. There
was no signiﬁcant association between meningioma
development and breast cancer. Use of aromatase inhibi-
tors conferred a trend of increased risk of meningioma in
patients with breast cancer, although no statistical signif-
icance was observed. The link between breast cancer and
meningioma has been reported in literature, with discor-
dant results. What is behind this association is quite
unclear, most likely being a hormonal etiology. Hormone
receptors are involved in both tumor types. In meningi-
omas, PgR is more prevalent and more biologically active
than ER. To ascertain a link between hormonal exposure
and development of meningioma, we focused on endo-
crine-responsive breast cancer and on patients receiving
endocrine therapy. In our cohort, the 10-year cum-inc ME
was 0.37% (95% CI, 0.26–0.55), similar to that reported by
Rao and colleagues (1). Our study has several limitations.
Despite the large cohort, a major limitation of this study is
the small number of meningioma cases recorded with
exposure to endocrine therapy. However, it has to be
acknowledged that the screening for meningioma is not
routinely conducted in patients with breast cancer. Also,
the endocrine therapy given to ER-positive patients may
have inﬂuenced the development of meningioma during
this period. Another limitation is related to the retrospec-
tive analysis. An important strength is that the records of
potential cases were manually reviewed and the case
status was validated by a data-monitoring system with
a conﬁrmation rate of 100%. In summary, this study, in
contrast with previous cohort studies, found no associa-
tion between development of meningioma and breast
cancer.
