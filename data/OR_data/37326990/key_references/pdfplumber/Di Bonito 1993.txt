SUMMARY
We report 12 new cases of female breast cancer associated with intracranial meningiomas,
inclusive ofa utopsy study. At the time ofd eath the patients' age ranged from 52 to 95 years
(average 70.6 years). Breast carcinomas were documented ante mortem in 11 cases and at
autopsy in 1. Meningiomas were diagnosed at autopsy (10 cases) or in vivo (2 cases). The
diagnosis of meningioma antedated that of mammary carcinoma in only one patient.
Histologically, the cancers were of ductal (11 cases) and lobular infiltrating (1 case) types
and showed a variable malignancy grade. Widespread extracranial metastases were
present at autopsy in 7 cases. Brain metastases were seen in 1 case. Neurologic signs were
referred in 4 subjects. Four breast cancers and one meningioma showed immunoreactivity
for progesterone receptors, whereas all the cases were negative for estrogen receptors.
In one case, metastatic breast carcinoma tissue was present within a psammomatous
meningioma.
A brief review of the literature, which includes 14 similar observations, is reported.
Although the association of breast cancer and meningioma is still difficult to explain, its
clinical implications are important and deserve proper attention. A proper work up in
patients with suspected intracranial metastases is recommended so that resectable
meningiomas are not mistaken for metastases.
