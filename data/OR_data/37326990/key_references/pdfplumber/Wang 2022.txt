Results: Seventeen percent of spinal meningioma cases (n¼12) had a preceding cancer diagnosis. Of
these 75% (n¼9/12) were attributable to breast cancer. Overall, breast cancer preceded a diagnosis of a
spinal meningioma in 16.4% of female cases (9/55). This is higher than expected number of breast cancer

Conclusion: Spinal meningioma is disproportionately over-represented in females. Patients present with
neurological deficits andsurgery improved both neurology andpatient reported quality of life. Relative to
the known UK prevalence of breast cancer, there is a significantly higher than expected association

The underlying link remains unknown, however several theories
have been proposed, including a role for hormonal receptors
such as estrogen and progesterone
receptors.45–48
The ability to
make an association has most likely been confounded by the fact
that spinal meningioma is a rare entity. In this case series, we
have identified, and reported a significantly increased prevalence
of breast cancer in female patients with spinal meningiomas.
Overall, nine female patients were previously diagnosed with
breast cancer. Out of 55 female patients, this represented a pro-
portion of 16.4%. This is significantly higher than baseline preva-
lence of breast cancer in female population (p<0.001) after
accounting for age, size of population and incidence of spinal
meningioma, and in direct contrast with the lower rate of breast
cancer within the female patients with nerve sheath tumors
(7.32%). It is difficult, however, to interpret the true significance
of this without comparing our data with established literature.
We therefore performed a systematic review of the English lan-
guage literature. Although there has been a wealth of literature
reporting the association between intracranial meningioma and
breast cancer, most are case reports and case series. We found
five studies looking into the relative risk against a background
population.13,14,32–34
However, only two of these articles directly
discussed the background population used and importantly the
expected rate of disease within the background population.13,14
Both studies extracted data from state cancer registry in the
USA. The Washington study13 looked at the incidence of breast
cancer in meningioma patients (1.84%) over a 6 years period and
vice versa (0.05%) and their expected incidence were calculated
based on 5-year age group specific incidence taking into account
of patient-year at risk, giving a relative risk of 1.54 for developing
breast cancer in meningioma patients. Similarly, Rao et al.14 used
data from five of the state registries, recording an incidence rate
of 3.59% for breast cancer in female meningioma patients and
0.21% for the reverse population over 9 years. However, they cal-
culated their expected incidence from annual incidence rather
than taking into account of the 9 years of the primary data,
which resulted the very high relative risk of 58 for breast cancer
in meningioma which was several magnitude higher than
reported
elsewhere.13,32–34
This most likely demonstrates bias
within this study rather than true risks. Three other studies
found also reported relative risk ratio including two based on
Swedish cancer registry and one of Norway national cancer regis-
try.32–34
These studies, however, did not discuss the background
population used for comparison. The relative risk of developing
meningioma in a breast cancer population was reported as 1.54
and those of breast cancer in meningioma population were
1.57–1.75. Combining the data and excluding the one outlier,14
the relative risk ratio of developing meningioma in patients with
breast cancer were between 1.54 and 1.75,13,32–34 with 1.54 being
the most commonly reported value. Similarly, the relative risk
ratio of developing breast cancers in patients with meningioma
was reported as 1.4 and 1.54. Given these studies used data from
different countries over different time periods and using different
data recording method, this is remarkably consistent. The
reported prevalence of breast cancer within meningioma popula-
tion was 1.63% to 8.33%. In comparison, in our series of spinal
meningiomas, the prevalence of breast cancer is 16.4% and sub-
stantially higher to those reported in literature for intracra-
nial meningioma.
No mechanistic link between meningioma and breast cancer
has been proven. We note, however, that in our case, series most
patients had estrogen receptor positive breast cancers and
received surgery, radiotherapy and hormonal therapy.
