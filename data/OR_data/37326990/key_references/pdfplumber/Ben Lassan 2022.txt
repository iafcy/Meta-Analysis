Abstract
Background There are limited data on whether primary diagnosis of meningioma may be associated with development of
secondary primary cancer (SPC).
Methods All meningioma cases (ICD-O-3 morphology codes 9530/0–9539/3) diagnosed in Jewish Israelis ≥ 20 years 1990
through 2015 registered in the Israel National Cancer Registry (INCR) were retrieved. All subsequent cancers occurring
more than 6 months after meningioma diagnosis were identified. Risk of secondary cancer (SPC) was compared to cancer
risk in the general population through the calculation of standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks
(EARs). SIRs were stratified by type of second cancer, sex, and age group. Cox regression models were used to estimate
hazard ratios of developing SPC.
Results Overall, 8044 meningioma cases were identified: mean age at diagnosis was 64.0 ± 14.1 years. Of these, 927 (11.5%)
were diagnosed with SPC (SIR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5–1.7). SPC risk was elevated in men (SIR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5–1.9) and women
(SIR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5–1.8) diagnosed with meningioma in univariable analyses. Cancers most commonly encountered in
the studied population were breast (17.6%), colorectal (13.4%), lung (8.1%), prostate (5%), and bladder (4.6%) cancer. In
multivariable analyses, 10+ year increment in age at meningioma diagnosis was significantly associated with higher risk
for SPC in individuals diagnosed with meningioma between 20 and 64 years, with an inverse association in the older age
group (65+ years).
Conclusions Meningioma diagnosis is associated with an increased risk for developing secondary cancers. This risk should
be discussed with patients treated for meningioma.

Introduction
Meningiomas are the most common benign tumors of the
central nervous system (CNS) with an age-adjusted inci-
dence rate (per 100,000 person/years) of 8.36 and 3.61 for
females and males, respectively, and a population prevalence
