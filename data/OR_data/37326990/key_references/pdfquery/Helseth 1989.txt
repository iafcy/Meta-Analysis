The association between meningioma and a primary malignant neoplasm at another site was studied. The 
data from the population-based Norwegian Cancer Registry were analysed according to whether the 
meningioma occurred before or after the malignant neoplasm. Male patients with meningioma showed a 
raised risk for developing a subsequent renal cancer. A significant association was found between 
meningioma and subsequent breast cancer in females 50-64 years old at time of meningioma diagnosis and 
between breast cancer and subsequent occurrence of meningioma. Breast cancer patients with symptoms 
of an intracranial neoplasm may therefore have a potentially curable meningioma and female meningioma 
patients over 50 years should be considered for breast cancer screening programmes. 


All benign and malignant tumours of the central 
nervous system (CNS) in Norway are reported to 
the National Cancer Registry. About 21% of all 
histologically verified CNS tumours are menin- 
giomas ( 14). The cytogenetics of meningiomas 
have been extensively studied (1) and interesting 
karyotype abnormalities on chromosome 22 have 
been found ( 1, 5 ) . The association between loss of 
chromosomal material and tumourigenesis fits the 
concept of tumour suppressor genes. The chromo- 
somal alterations could imply a genetic predispos- 
tion that may be of importance for tumourigenesis 
in a broader context. An analysisof the occurrence 
and risk of multiple neoplasms in meningioma 
patients may contribute to a clarification of the 
question. An association between meningiomas 
and breast cancer was first described by Schoen- 
berg et a/. (22) and confirmed for breast cancer

with subsequent meningioma by Emry (8). A total 
of 67 breast cancer patients with subsequent 
meningoma have been reported up to 1986 (4,8). 
A predisposition to develop breast cancer as the 
second tumour has not been established in menin- 
gioma patients (6, 8). We present the results of an 
investigation into the occurrence of meningiomas 
and coincident cancers in the total Norwegian 
population from 1955 through 1986. 

In general, meningiomas are treated by surgery alone, 
whereas irradiation and cytostatics are often part of the 
treatment of malignant neoplasms. Since a causal rela- 
tionship between exposure to irradiation/ cytostatics and 
later development of meningioma cannot be excluded, 
it is necessary to analyse the data according to whether 
the malignant tumour occurred before or after the 
meningioma. With meningioma as the second neo- 
plasm, analysis primarily was delimited to breast cancer 

for which a significant association had been reported 
previously (8). A considerable number, up to 35% (12, 
18) of all meningiomas are asymptomatic and are found 
at autopsy. 
The number of neoplasms that one would expect to 
observe in a defined cohort was calculated via a comput- 
er program by multiplying the age-, sex- and calendar 
specific incidence rate by the belonging number of 
person-years at risk. The end of the follow-up period was 
determined by death, emigration or end of the study 
period on December 3 I , 1986. The ratio of observed to 
expected tumours was then computed. A Poisson distri- 
bution was assumed valid for the observed numbers 
when presentingconfidence intervals (CI) for the relative 
ratio (RR) between observed and expected numbers. 
Each primary neoplasm is registered according to month 
and year of diagnosis in the Cancer Registry and the time 
lapse between multiple neoplasms was computed. 
All patients with a malignant tumour diagnosed one 
month or more before a meningioma were selected from 
the data-base and tabulated according to the site of the 
first tumour. In addition, female breast cancer patients 
(n = 42,414) were matched with the data-base in order 
to detect the occurrence of subsequent meningiomas. 
The observed number was compared with the computed 
expected value. 
Altogether 1632 meningioma patients were registered 
in the data-base. Patients for whom the diagnosis was 
first established at autopsy were excluded (n = 271), 
leaving 454 males and 907 females for further study. 
These cohorts were matched with the data-base and 
malignant neoplasms diagnosed subsequently were 
identified and added to the file. One of the female 
patients developed bilateral breast cancer, 67 (left side) 
and 102 months (right side) after the meningioma was 
diagnosed. Both were adenocarcinomas with metastases 
to the axillary lymph nodes of the same side. 


Ninety-five malignant neoplasms preceded 
meningioma (Table 1 ). Except for breast cancer, no 
marked clustering of tumours was apparent when

the meningioma was diagnosed as a result of 
clinical symptoms. The time lapse between the 
diagnoses of the two neoplasms was shorter than 
3 years in 50% of the cases. 
Of the 42,414 females registered with breast 
cancer, 2 1 later developed a histologically verified 
meningioma as opposed to the expected number 
of 11.99 (Table 2). The corresponding relative 
ratio of 1.75 represents a statistically significant 
increased risk of meningioma occurrence in breast 
cancer patients. The mean time lapse was 86.5 
months (SD: 86.9) with a range from 4 months to 
26 years. Nine of the meningiomas were incidental 
findings at autopsy. The autopsy frequency ac- 
cording to age for female breast cancer patients 
that died during the period 1975-1977 (n = 2,807) 
is given in Table 3. It is evident that there is a lower 
autopsy rate in these patients than in the general 
population (9). 

One hundred and nineteen neoplasms occurred 
subsequently in the cohort of meningioma pa-

tients. Table 4 gives the observed and expected 
numbers according to the site of the second 
primary. The time lapse between the diagnosis of 
meningioma and renal cancer in males was 5 
months or less in four patients and three and 
thirteen years in the other two patients. Two of the 
five thyroid cancers in females were found in one 
patient. The diagnosis of follicular carcinoma was 
made after a hemi-thyroidectomy. The other lobe 
was resected and an occult papillary carcinoma 
was found. The meningioma and the thyroid 
cancer were discovered simultaneously in another 
patient. When these two patients are deducted, the 
relative ratio is no longer significantly increased. 
Table 2 also shows the coincidence of menin- 
gioma and breast cancer. Twenty-two histological- 
ly verified breast cancers occurred subsequently in 
the meningioma patients as opposed to the expect- 
ed number of 14.26, the relative ratio of 1.54 for 
the total group approaching statistical significance 
with regard to an increased risk of developing 
breast cancer in meningioma patients (p = 6.8%). 
The relative ratio for the age-group 50-64 years is 
statistically significant (p = 4.2%). The mean time 
lapse was67.7 months (SD: 54.9) with a range from 
10 months to 18 years. 

The possibility that renal cancer patients devel- 
op meningioma was then assessed. For females (n 
= 4,262) three subsequent meningiomas were 
registered, compared with an expected number of 
0.66 (relative ratio 4.55 with 95% confidence 
interval 0.94- 13.29). No meningiomas occurred in 
males (n = 6,391; expected 0.57).

Epidemiological cancer research in Norway profits 
from having had a National Cancer Registry since 
1952 and a defined population in which individu- 
als are identified by a personal number. In addition 
to a virtually complete registration of all solid 
malignant neoplasms, benign tumours affecting 
the nervous system and endocrine organs are also 
reported. Meningiomas are among the few benign 
tumours available in the Cancer Registry for epi- 
demiological coincidence studies. 

A common determinant may be active in a 
patient with two or more primary neoplasms. A 
minority belong to “cancer families”, which im- 
plies that there is a strong genetic disposition for 
cancer. Other patients develop more than one 
primary neoplasm by statistical coincidence. 
Treated cancer patients have at least the same risk 
of developing a new primary as others. Additional- 
ly, exposure to cancer determinants could for some 
of the patients have increased their risk of a second 
primary neoplasm. Also, the number of multiple 
tumours in a community to a certain extent must 
reflect the diagnostic opportunities and investiga- 
tion resources available. The level of patient costs 
for medical services and the autopsy rate are both 
factors that are likely to cause variation in the 
recognition of multiple primary neoplasms. 
A causal relationship between the treatment of 
the first cancer (e.g. cytostatics and irradiation) 
and the genesis of the second should be considered. 
This relationship constitutes a source of confusion 
when the aim of a study is to reveal etiological 


factors of importance for both neoplasms. In this 
series, the coincidence of meningioma, a benign 
tumour, with malignant tumours is analysed. It 
was therefore necessary to define the cohorts 
according to the nature of the first neoplasm. 
Coincidence studies of meningiomas demand 
special attention with regard to: i) differences in 
autopsy rates between the group of patients under 
study and the total population, and ii) the diagnos- 
tic sensitivity at autopsy to small intracranial 
tumours. Three neoplasms are known to have a 
propensity for brain metastasis, bronchogenic car- 
cinoma, breast cancer and malignant melanoma 
(24). It is possible that the pathologist is more alert 
when examining the intracranial contents in these 
patients. 

After deduction of two cases with thyroid can- 
cer, significantly increased relative ratios were 
found for one age-group of female breast cancer 
patients and for renal cancer in males. A Danish 
study of 10,723 persones with all types of tumours 
of the nervous system found a significantly in- 
creased risk for subsequent cancer of the kidney, 
tumours of connective tissue and melanoma (29). 
A similar study of 3,744 individuals developing 
brain cancer in the period 1935- 1982 in Connect- 
icut (USA) found an excess of malignant 
melanoma and acute leukemia as second primary 
neoplasms (26). In the Connecticut study, howev- 
er, benign intracranial tumours, e.g. meningiomas, 
were not included (3). To our knowledge, the 
present study is the first report of a significantly 
increased risk of renal cell carcinoma in menin- 
gioma patients. 
Some determinants seem to be common to both 
meningioma and renal cancer: Meningioma (10) 
and renal cell carcinoma (23, 19) both express 
estrogen receptor protein. Monosomy or deletion 
of parts of chromosome 22 is frequently found in 
meningiomas and it is proposed that loss of a 
tumour supressor gene (emerogen) distal to the 
myoglobin locus on chromosome 22 may be the 
mechanism involved (7). In renal cell carcinomas 
loss of alleles on the short arm of chromosome 3 
has been demonstrated (17,25,28). These deletions 
are of special interest since an oncogene, c-raf 1, 
has been located to this region. A structural shift of 
the c-raf 1 locus to the breakpoint region may alter 
the expression of the gene (25). Though the genetic 
sequences involved are dissimilar, both tumours 

characteristically may have a deletion at a fragde 
chromosomal site. Data from case-control studies 
have been compared as regards risk factors. In 
meningiomas, exposure of the head to therapeutic 
and diagnostic X-ray, head trauma and nitrites in 
the food were associated with increased risk in 
females (20), whereas the former two were revealed 
in a similar study of male meningioma patients 
(2 1). The development of renal cell carcinomas is 
related to cigarette smoking in case-control and 
cohort studies conducted on males (27). Obesity, 
generally, is a significant risk factor ( 1 1,27) and in 
females diuretics and coffee have been suggested as 
additional risk factors (27). Hoflnan et al. ( 1 5 ) 
suggest that the association between smoking and 
renal cell carcinoma may imply a role of N-ni- 
trosamines in the etiology of the disease. Ni- 
trosamines may emerge as a common risk factor 
for both meningioma and renal cell carcinoma, 
although so far only reported forfernale menin- 
gioma patients. Renal cell adenomas have also 
been associated with cigarette smoking (2). 

Normal and neoplastic meningeal cells contain 
receptors for various signal substances including 
female sex hormones. The biological relevance of 
the latter in the tumourigenesis of meningiomas is 
unclear, but they have been linked to the female 
preponderance of meningiomas. Hormones play 
an active role in some tumour types, e.g. cancers 
of the breast, uterine body, ovary and prostate. It 
is important to note that the meningioma patients 
in the present study did not show a statistically 
significant increase or decrease in risk for these 
cancer types, with one exception, breast cancer 
patients 50-64 years of age. In a recent study ( 16), 
5 out of 117 female meningioma patients had a 
combination of intracranial meningioma, breast 
cancer and genital cancer which the authors pro- 
pose is a unique combination of neoplasms in 
women. In this series we found only 2 patients with 
this combination. 
In this study, female meningioma patients 50-64 
years of age have a statistically significant increas- 
ed relative ratio for breast cancer (RR = 1.66) (Table 
2). Ernry (8) did not find an increased risk for 
breast cancer in meningioma patients. However, 
the study did not have follow up data at the in- 
dividual level, in contrast to the situation in Nor- 
way. This seems particularly important in the case 
of benign tumours with good survival prospects. 

Patients with breast cancer have a significantly 
increased risk of developing a meningioma. Our 
data indicate that the risk is higher for those 50 
years and over at the time of breast cancer diagno- 
sis. Nine of 2 1 of the meningomas were incidental 
findings at autopsy. We have documented that 
breast cancer patients have a reduced autopsy rate 
(Table 3). Our results then imply either that silent 
meningiomas are even more common among 
breast cancer patients than revealed in this study 
and are therefore of interest for the understanding 
of tumourigenesis, or that the diagnostic sensitivi- 
ty for intracranial neoplasms at autopsy is higher 
for breast cancer patients, or a combination of 
these factors. The mean time lapse between the 
breast cancer and the meningioma was 86.5 
months (SD = 86.9) in the present study compared 
to a mean value of 40.4 months (SD = 31.8) 
reported by Emry (8). In terms of a possible causal 
relationship between the diagnostic procedures 
and treatment of breast cancer and the develop- 
ment of a subsequent meningioma, the latent 
period is rather short. It is, however, possible that 
some of the patients with incidental meningiomas 
would have developed symptoms if they had lived 
longer. A causal relationship should therefore not 
be excluded. 

Our results add to the weight of evidence that there 
is an association between breast cancer and menin- 
gioma. Male meningioma patients have a signifi- 
cantly increased risk of developing renal cancer. 
The clinical implications of this are that breast 
cancer patients with symptoms of an intracranial 
neoplasm may have a potentially curable menin- 
gioma and that female meningioma patients over 
50 years should be offered breast cancer screening 
programmes.
