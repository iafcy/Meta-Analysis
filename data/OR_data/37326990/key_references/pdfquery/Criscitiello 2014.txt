Methods: A monoinstitutional, retrospective analysis was performed at European Institute of Oncology on 
12,330 patients with breast cancer. The cumulative incidence of meningioma was estimated using the Kaplan– 
Meier method and the log-rank test was used to assess differences between groups. 
Results: In total, 33 patients with meningioma were identiﬁed from a study population of 12,330, with a 10- 
year cumulative incidence of meningioma of 0.37%. We did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly increased risk of 
meningioma among patients with breast cancer or an association between the hormonal receptor status and 
the risk of meningioma (P ¼ 0.65). 






Meningiomas are typically benign tumors arising from 
the meningothelial cells of the arachnoid membrane cov- 
ering the brain and spinal cord. The etiology of meningi- 
omas is largely unknown. There is evidence to suggest 
that breast cancer may play a role in the development of 
these 
meningiomas, 
tumors occur more commonly in women (1, 2). Further 
evidence for a possible role for hormones in brain tumor 
etiology includes the presence of progesterone (PgR), 
estrogen (ER), and androgen receptors in some meningi- 
omas, suggesting a link between breast cancer and menin- 
giomas. Immunohistochemical studies have shown that 
about 70% of meningiomas express PgR and about 30% 
express ER, thus corroborating the hypothesis that menin- 
gioma is a hormone-sensitive tumor (3, 4). Our study was 
carried out to explore the possible association between 
breast cancer, endocrine therapy, and the risk of devel- 
oping meningioma in a large monoinstitutional popula- 
tion of patients with breast cancer. We focused on endo-

crine-responsive tumors to ﬁnd a potential link between 
these tumors and endocrine therapy. 


Data from 12,330 women with early-stage breast cancer 
who underwent surgery at the European Institute of 
Oncology (IEO) in Milan between 1994 and 2011 were 
retrieved from two institutional databases: the Breast 
Cancer database, which contains information on patients 
with breast cancer operated at IEO, and the Tumor Reg- 
istry. Patients who received neoadjuvant 
treatment, 
patients with a previous history of cancer, or patients 
with metastatic breast cancer at diagnosis were excluded 
from the analysis. Breast cancer–related data on age, 
menopausal 
surgery, histopathology (Ki-67 
expression, ER/PgR expression, and HER2 status) and 
systemic treatment were analyzed. Usually, patients were 
followed up with physical examination every 6 months, 
annual mammography, breast ultrasound, and blood tests 
every 6 to 12 months, and additional evaluations when 
clinically indicated. Whenever possible, the health status 
of women who did not come back for scheduled follow-up 
visits for more than 1 year was obtained by phone contact. 
Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective 
analysis. The primary endpoint was the cumulative inci- 
dence of meningioma (cum-inc ME), calculated from 
breast surgery to meningioma diagnosis. The cum-inc ME 
was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. The log- 
rank test was used to assess differences between groups. 
All analyses were carried out with the SAS software 9.3 
(SAS Institute).

From January 1994 to December 2011, we identiﬁed a 
total of 12,330 consecutive patients with early-stage breast 
cancer. At a median follow-up of 7 years, 33 patients with 
meningioma were identiﬁed from a study population of 
12,330. Table 1 describes selected demographic, clinical, 
and pathologic characteristics of the study population at 
the time of breast cancer surgery, systemic treatments 







administered, number of meningiomas, and 10-year cum- 
inc ME. Considering the entire population, the 10-year 
cum-inc ME was 0.37% [95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 
0.26%–0.55%]. No association was found between ER/ 
PgR and the risk of meningioma. No association was 
found if we matched analysis coupling ER and PgR (P 
¼ 0.65) or considering them separately (ER, P ¼ 0.18 and 
PgR, P ¼ 0.60). Patients who received aromatase inhibitors 
had a trend of higher risk to develop meningioma 
compared with patients who received tamoxifen, with 
a borderline statistical signiﬁcance (P ¼ 0.054). No other 
signiﬁcant association was observed in the analyzed 
variables. 

This large, retrospective study evaluated more than 
12,000 patients with breast cancer with an average fol- 
low-up period of 7 years, and identiﬁed a total of 33 
individuals with an incident case of meningioma. There 
was no signiﬁcant association between meningioma 
development and breast cancer. Use of aromatase inhibi- 
tors conferred a trend of increased risk of meningioma in 
patients with breast cancer, although no statistical signif- 
icance was observed. The link between breast cancer and 
meningioma has been reported in literature, with discor- 
dant results. What is behind this association is quite 
unclear, most likely being a hormonal etiology. Hormone 
receptors are involved in both tumor types. In meningi- 
omas, PgR is more prevalent and more biologically active 
than ER. To ascertain a link between hormonal exposure 
and development of meningioma, we focused on endo- 
crine-responsive breast cancer and on patients receiving 
endocrine therapy. In our cohort, the 10-year cum-inc ME 
was 0.37% (95% CI, 0.26–0.55), similar to that reported by 
Rao and colleagues (1). Our study has several limitations. 


Despite the large cohort, a major limitation of this study is 
the small number of meningioma cases recorded with 
exposure to endocrine therapy. However, it has to be 
acknowledged that the screening for meningioma is not 
routinely conducted in patients with breast cancer. Also, 
the endocrine therapy given to ER-positive patients may 
have inﬂuenced the development of meningioma during 
this period. Another limitation is related to the retrospec- 
tive analysis. An important strength is that the records of 
potential cases were manually reviewed and the case 
status was validated by a data-monitoring system with 
a conﬁrmation rate of 100%. In summary, this study, in 
contrast with previous cohort studies, found no associa- 
tion between development of meningioma and breast 
cancer.
