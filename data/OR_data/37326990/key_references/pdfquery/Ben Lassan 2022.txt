Abstract 
Background There are limited data on whether primary diagnosis of meningioma may be associated with development of 
secondary primary cancer (SPC). 
Methods All meningioma cases (ICD-O-3 morphology codes 9530/0–9539/3) diagnosed in Jewish Israelis ≥ 20 years 1990 
through 2015 registered in the Israel National Cancer Registry (INCR) were retrieved. All subsequent cancers occurring 
more than 6 months after meningioma diagnosis were identified. Risk of secondary cancer (SPC) was compared to cancer 
risk in the general population through the calculation of standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks 
(EARs). SIRs were stratified by type of second cancer, sex, and age group. Cox regression models were used to estimate 
hazard ratios of developing SPC. 
Results Overall, 8044 meningioma cases were identified: mean age at diagnosis was 64.0 ± 14.1 years. Of these, 927 (11.5%) 
were diagnosed with SPC (SIR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5–1.7). SPC risk was elevated in men (SIR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5–1.9) and women 
(SIR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5–1.8) diagnosed with meningioma in univariable analyses. Cancers most commonly encountered in 
the studied population were breast (17.6%), colorectal (13.4%), lung (8.1%), prostate (5%), and bladder (4.6%) cancer. In 
multivariable analyses, 10+ year increment in age at meningioma diagnosis was significantly associated with higher risk 
for SPC in individuals diagnosed with meningioma between 20 and 64 years, with an inverse association in the older age 
group (65+ years). 
Conclusions Meningioma diagnosis is associated with an increased risk for developing secondary cancers. This risk should 
be discussed with patients treated for meningioma.

Meningiomas are the most common benign tumors of the 
central nervous system (CNS) with an age-adjusted inci- 
dence rate (per 100,000 person/years) of 8.36 and 3.61 for 
females and males, respectively, and a population prevalence 
rate of 97.5/100,000 in the United States [1]. Meningiomas 
most commonly occur sporadically with no discernable fam- 
ily history, and are not associated with additional neoplasms 
or inherited tumor predisposition syndromes, except for 
over-representation of meningiomas in cases with Neurofi- 
bromatosis type 2 (NF2) [2]. Exposure to ionizing radiation, 
in particular therapeutic irradiation for childhood cancer [3], 
and in atomic bomb survivors [4], is a well- established risk 
factor for meningioma. Several studies have suggested radio- 
therapy and chemotherapy administered for the treatment 
of pediatric cancer confer an increased risk of meningioma 



 
 
 

[3, 5], with an estimated 1 in 8 childhood cancer survivors 
developed late meningioma by age 40 years, correlated with 
radiation dose and exposure age [3]. 
Studies that have focused on secondary primary cancers 
(SPCs) diagnosed in patients initially diagnosed with men- 
ingioma have yielded inconsistent results. Some studies 
reported no statistically significant risk for developing breast 
cancer [6, 7] or any cancer type studied [8–10] regardless 
of meningioma irradiation treatment [8, 9] and malignant 
meningioma phenotype [8, 10]. Taken together, these stud- 
ies indicate no increased risk for SPCs in persons diagnosed 
with malignant meningioma compared with the risk of pri- 
mary cancer in the general population. 
In contrast to the above-referenced studies showing no 
excess risk for secondary cancer after meningioma diag- 
nosis, Davis et al. [11] evaluated the risk of SPCs after 
meningioma diagnosis in Sweden between 1958 and1997. 
Of 12,012 meningioma cases, 926 (7.7%) were diagnosed 
with any SPC, with SIR = 1.2 (95% CI 1.1–1.3). Specifi- 
cally, statistically significant SIRs were observed for renal 
cancer (SIR = 1.6), melanoma (SIR = 1.7), thyroid cancer 
(SIR = 2.6), and brain tumors (SIR = 2.6). The long-term 
prognosis and quality of life of meningioma patients are 
undoubtedly influenced by long-term morbidity that may 
be associated with the treatment they received for their pri- 
mary cancer, and more data are needed in this respect. In the 
present study, data from the Israel National Cancer Registry 
were used to calculate the risk of subsequent cancer diag- 
noses in individuals diagnosed with meningioma during the 
period from 1990 to 2015. 


Cancer Registry-The Israel National Cancer Registry 
(INCR), established in 1960, is a population-based, pas- 
sive, national registry covering the population of the State 
of Israel (approximately 9 million in 2020). The registry 
records all incident cases of in situ and malignant neoplasms 
(with the exception of squamous cell and basal cell carci- 
nomas of the skin), and benign neoplasms of the brain and 
central nervous system. Reporting to the registry has been 
mandatory since 1982. The completeness of the INCR’s data 
has been estimated at 97% for solid tumors and 87% for 
hematopoietic tumors [12]. 
All cases registered in the INCR database meeting the 
following criteria were identified: diagnosis of meningi- 
oma (ICD-O-3 morphology codes 9530/0–9539/3) during 
the period from 1990 to2015; age 20 and over at the time 
of the meningioma diagnosis; no history of malignant dis- 
ease prior to the meningioma diagnosis; date of diagnosis 
of meningioma not equal to the date of death; meningioma 
diagnosis not based solely on a death certificate; Jewish 
religion, as recorded in the National Population Registry. 
Persons of other ethnicities were excluded from analysis as 
they comprised only 10% of the population of meningioma 
patients. 
For all persons meeting the study inclusion criteria, we 
searched the registry database for subsequent cancer diag- 
noses. Individuals diagnosed with a second primary can- 
cer (SPC) less than 6 months after the index meningioma 
diagnosis were excluded from the study cohort, in order to 
avoid including primary cancers that may have been present, 
but not clinically evident, at the time of the meningioma 
diagnosis. Follow-up time was calculated as time from men- 
ingioma diagnosis to the first of the following events: (1) 
SPC diagnosis, (2) death, (3) the end of the follow-up period 
(31 December 2017). The study was approved by the Sheba 
Medical Center ethics committee. 

We conducted a descriptive analysis of the meningioma 
cohort with attention to covariates likely to be associated 
with the development of a second primary malignancy [age 
at meningioma diagnosis, sex, tumor behavior of menin- 
gioma (invasive/noninvasive), and year of meningioma 
diagnosis]. 
The outcome of interest was the diagnosis of any SPC 
after a prior diagnosis of meningioma. Age at meningioma 
diagnosis was grouped into two age groups: 20–64 years, 
and 65+ years. The reason for this age-based subdivision 
was an attempt to highlight the putative effects of genetic 
predisposition to tumor development (presumably more 
apparent in the younger age group). We calculated the rate of 
SPC as the number of persons diagnosed with a subsequent 
primary cancer divided by total person-years of follow-up. 

The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the cumu- 
lative incidence of SPC in persons with meningioma dur- 
ing the period of follow-up, stratified by age at meningi- 
oma diagnosis and sex group. Gray’s test was used to test 
the homogeneity of cumulative incidence functions (CIF) 
between age and sex groups. 
Calculation of standardized incidence ratios 
and excess absolute risks 
We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for all 
subsequent SPC and for the most frequently occurring 
cancer types as the number of cases observed in the study 
cohort during the follow-up period, divided by the number 



of cases that would be expected in the cohort on the basis of 
age, sex, and population-group specific cancer rates for the 
Israeli Jewish population [13]. We calculated excess absolute 
risks as the difference between the number of observed and 
expected events divided by the number of person-years in 
follow-up and expressed per 100,000. 

We used multivariable Fine and Gray’s proportional sub- 
distribution hazard models (PSH) to examine the risk of 
developing SPC following meningioma diagnosis in each 
of the age groups defined, adjusting for age at meningioma 
diagnosis as a continuous variable, using increments of 5, 
10, and 20 years, as well as adjusting for sex and year of 
meningioma diagnosis, and considering death as a compet- 
ing risk. 
Hazard ratios were generated for SPC risk at 5, 10, and 
15 years after meningioma diagnosis. Standard asymptotic 
inference methods for COX regression that were based on 
partial likelihood were used to construct 95% confidence 
intervals and to carry out two-sided tests of statistical signifi- 
cance. All reported p values were two-sided and considered 
statistically significant if < 0.05. 

Overall, the study encompassed 8,044 meningioma cases 
[140 (1.7%) malignant] who met the study inclusion cri- 
teria, with a total of 40,134 person-years in follow-up 
(Fig. 1) (median follow-up 4.5 years, interquartile range 2.4 
to 6.7 years). Of these cases, 2,308 (28.7%) were males, 
and 5,736 (71.3%) females. Mean age at diagnosis was 
64.1 years (Standard Deviation, SD = 13.5) and 63.8 years 
(SD = 14.4), for males and females, respectively. Overall, 
927 (rate of 15.7 per 1000 person-years) of participants were 
diagnosed with SPCs during follow-up (Table 1). Almost 
50% of SPC were diagnosed 1 to 5 years following menin- 
gioma diagnosis, and an additional 25% were diagnosed 5 
to 10 years following that diagnosis. 
Standardized incidence ratio and excess absolute 
risk analysis 
The five most common SPC in males were prostate (16.8%), 
colorectal cancer (15.0%), lung cancer (11.3%), bladder 
cancer (10.0%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (6.3%). In 
females, breast cancer (25.0%), colorectal cancer (12.7%),

lung cancer (6.9%), thyroid cancer (4.3%) and cancer of the 
uterus (4.2%) were the most commonly encountered SPCs. 
Both men and women with a meningioma diagnosis had 
an elevated risk of developing a SPC compared with the 
general population (SIR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5–1.9 and 1.6, 95% 
CI 1.5–1.8, respectively) (Table 2). In males, the SIR was 
statistically significant for most cancer types with the nota- 
ble exception of pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, malignant 
melanoma, stomach cancer and thyroid cancer (Table 2). In 
females, the risks of SPC for all cancer types analyzed were 
statistically significant with the exception of bladder and 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Table 2). 

We analyzed the cumulative incidence rates for develop- 
ing SPC. We compared the cumulative incidence function 
(CIF) between age groups by using Gray’s test, as presented 
in Fig. 2. We found that the cumulative incidence rate for 
SPC at 20 years after first meningioma diagnosis was higher 
among persons who were older at the time of meningioma 
diagnosis: 9.9% (95% CI 8.79–11.27%) among 20–64 year 
olds and 23.76% (95% CI 22–29.4%) among those 65 and 
older age. We found no association between sex and cumula- 
tive risk of SPC (p = 0.7207). 

We used multivariable Fine and Gray’s proportional sub- 
distribution hazard models (PSH) to examine the risk of 
developing SPC following meningioma diagnosis. The 
proportional hazard assumption for age effect was violated, 
since the effect of age varies over time; therefore, the final 
Cox regression model was fitted accordingly: analysis by 
age groups (20–64 years and 65+ years), adjusting for age at 
meningioma diagnosis as a continuous variable (using incre- 
ments of 5, 10 and 20 years), sex, and year of meningioma 
diagnosis categorized into two time periods (1990–2009 
and 2010–2015) and considering death as a competing risk. 
Interaction between age and time of diagnosis was signifi- 
cant; however, this was not included in the final model due 
to its negligible effect. This model showed significant inde- 
pendent association of age with risk of developing SPC. 
Individuals diagnosed with meningioma in the younger age 
group (20–64 years), increments of 10 and 20 years in age 
at diagnosis were significantly associated with higher risk 
for SPC: HR 1.66 (95% CI 1.02–2.72) and HR 4.25 (95% CI 
2.38–7.60), respectively. In persons diagnosed with meningi- 
oma in the older age group (65+ years), increments of 5, 10, 
and 20 years in age at diagnosis were significantly associ- 
ated with lower risk for SPC: HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.53–0.97), 
HR 0.71 (0.52–0.96) and HR 0.69 (95% CI 0.49–0.97), 
respectively (Table 3). 

The current study shows that a history of meningioma, in 
most cases a benign tumor, increases the risk for developing 
a host of secondary cancers, more often in individuals older 
than 65 years of age at the time of meningioma diagnosis. 
However, while in individuals diagnosed with meningioma 
between 20 and 64 years of age a more advanced age at 
meningioma diagnosis is a significant risk factor for SPC, 
this association is inverse in the older age group (65+ at 
meningioma diagnosis). Diagnosis of more than one tumor 
type in a single individual is one of the hallmarks of cancer 
susceptibility [14]. Yet, cancer susceptibility syndromes that 
encompass meningioma risk are rare, and primarily include 
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) [15]. While it is still pos- 
sible that a subset of cases analyzed herein are indeed unrec- 
ognized NF2 cases, the spectrum of malignant tumors that 
are encountered in these unselected meningioma cases far 
exceeds those associated with NF2 (acoustic neuroma, for 
the most part). Moreover, given the estimated rates of NF2 
(1–9/100,000) [16] it is unlikely that NF2-enriched cases 
underlie the observed increased cancer rates. 
While there is ample evidence regarding the association 
between therapeutic irradiation for a malignant tumor and 
the subsequent development of meningioma [17], there are 
few reports of a meningioma association with subsequent 
cancer. Helseth et al. [6] reviewed the association between 
meningioma and breast cancer in Norway from 1955 to 
1986, and reported that the relative risk (RR) for develop- 
ing breast cancer in women aged 50–64 years who were 
initially diagnosed with meningioma and followed up for 
3,932 person/years was significantly elevated (RR 1.92 CI 
1.02–3.29). Risk for renal cancer in men was also elevated

(RR 4.76 p = 0.05). Claus et al. [18] reported that meningi- 
oma patients (n = 1,124) were more likely than the controls 
(n = 1,000) to have a family history of meningioma in a first- 
degree relative (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.6–11.5), personal history 
of thyroid cancer (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.02–21.5), or leukemia 
(OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.2–24.1) (most after radiotherapy). These 
are all indirect lines of evidence that support the notion of 
a common genetic predisposition to meningioma and SPC. 
A common clinical practice in Israel in the 1950’s to the 
early 1960’s was to use low dose irradiation to treat Tinea

Capitis, especially in new immigrants from North Africa 
[19]. A subset of these irradiated individuals developed 
benign (and malignant) brain tumors. In the most com- 
prehensive long-term follow-up (40-year-median follow- 
up) 67/10,834 irradiated individuals were diagnosed with 
meningiomas [20]. Thus, it seems that even if a small sub- 
set of the current cohort did undergo low dose irradiation 
for Tinea capitis, the overall effects on the results would be 
minimal. 
One possible mechanism that may be considered to 
account for the meningioma-SPC association may be a yet 
unknown cancer susceptibility gene that confers higher sus- 
ceptibility to SPC in a subset of meningioma cases. Support- 
ive evidence for this possibility was reported by Hemminki 
et al. [21] who assessed the risk for first degree relatives 
of individuals with meningioma to develop the same tumor 
type. In that study, the standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) 
for familial risk were increased: when either of the parents 
was diagnosed with meningioma, the SIR for offspring was 
3.06, and for an affected sibling, the SIR was 4.41. These 
increased familial risks may indicate a common genetic fac- 
tor or a shared environmental exposure. Barchana and Liph- 
shitz [22] reported that based on a limited number of benign 
meningioma cases (n = 412) Iranian Jews living in Israel 
have higher rates of meningioma compared with rates in 
other Jewish communities originating in Balkan states: 1.46- 
fold compared with Turkish Jews and 1.86-fold compared 
with Jews of Bulgarian, Greek origin. To further explore 
the possibility of genetic susceptibility, subsequent studies 



should focus on families displaying this meningioma— 
SPC phenotype and combine whole exome/ whole-genome 
sequencing technologies to identify the putative gene(s). In 
addition, the surveillance scheme that meningioma cases 
are offered after diagnosis may account for higher rates of 
SPC diagnosis. Thus, cancers may have been incidentally 
diagnosed in meningioma cases who remain under medical 
surveillance after meningioma diagnosis. This possibility 
needs to be further explored, if the results of the current 
study are validated. Moreover, assessment of the impact of 
such a seemingly early stage cancer on survival can only be 
prospectively assessed. 
Age-adjusted risk analysis showed that in individuals 
diagnosed with meningioma under 64 years of age the risk 
for SPC increased in those older at meningioma diagnosis 
whereas in those diagnosed with meningioma above that 
age, the association between age at meningioma diagnosis 
and SPC risk was inverse. Several factors could account for 
that difference. The small number of individuals diagnosed 
at the older age group, a survival bias for those who did get 
to age 65 and above, and the relatively shorter life span of 
the older vs. the younger age group. 
The results of this preliminary study should be validated 
in larger, ethnically diverse, prospective studies. If validated, 
there may be clinical implications to the observed higher 
SPC risk. These increased risks, once quantified, should be 
discussed with meningioma cases by the treating physician 
and surveillance schemes should be evaluated to facilitate 
early detection of specific cancer types, whenever possible 
and cost effective. 
The limitations of the current study should be considered. 
This is a single country experience and cancer susceptibility 
may be distinct in other ethnically diverse, genetically het- 
erogeneous populations. The possibility of a selection bias 
should also be considered, as reporting of non-malignant 
cases may be non-complete and one of the caveats. Further- 
more, meningioma diagnosis may either lead to increased 
medical surveillance, or mark a subgroup of individuals 
who are using the medical system more regularly and thus 
have their tumors detected sooner. Additionally, our inabil- 
ity to adjust for potential confounders, especially variables 
that are associated with both meningioma incidence and 
other cancers occurrence such as smoking and obesity, may 
have caused information bias. Specifically, given the fact 
that smoking status is missing from the majority of cases 
reported herein, and the known effect that smoking has on 
multiple cancer types, this is a major limitation. 
In conclusion, a history of meningioma is associated with 
an increased risk for developing a variety of cancer types, 
especially in individuals aged 65 years of age and over at 
meningioma diagnosis. These results, if validated in subse- 
quent studies, may have clinical implication and may offer 
early detection schemes tailored to these individuals.
