BACKGROUND. Published case reports of a possible association between meningi- 
oma and breast carcinoma are not uncommon in the literature. Four published 






meningioma in women who were diagnosed with breast carcinoma. 
METHODS. The measure of association is the relative risk and is reported as the 
standardized incidence ratio (SIR). Using western Washington State cancer registry 


and breast carcinoma cohorts and the general population for the years 1992–1998. 
RESULTS. The risk of breast carcinoma after patients were diagnosed with menin- 
gioma (SIR) was 1.54 (95% conﬁdence interval [95% CI], 0.77–2.75). The risk of 


breast carcinoma was 1.64 (95% CI, 0.79 –3.02). In each combination for age groups 
ages (cid:1) 50 years, risks were elevated, but the conﬁdence intervals included 1.0. 
CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that the risk of meningioma among women 
who have experienced breast carcinoma and the risk of breast carcinoma among

ciation between meningioma and breast carcinoma. In the inter- 
vening years, several clinical reports of patients who developed both 
meningioma and breast carcinoma have been published. Since 1980, 
at least 12 case reports have been published in English language 
journals in which 56 individuals with diagnoses of both breast carci- 
noma and meningioma were described.1–11 Before 1980, 17 additional 
patients were reported in English language journals.12 The clinical 
literature suggests several possible mechanisms to explain the clinical 
reports. One article posited an association based merely on collision 
tumors in which a malignant tumor (breast carcinoma) metastasizes 
to a preexisting benign tumor (meningioma).12 Reports of breast 
carcinoma and meningioma in situations where the presence of 
pathologically conﬁrmed collision tumors could not 
be demonstrated prompted explanations suggesting 
that meningioma may result as a direct metastasis of 
breast carcinoma. Several case reports described me- 
ningioma as a pathologically conﬁrmed, metastatic 
product of breast carcinoma.1–3 However, at least one 
case report suggested the opposite relation, with me- 
ningioma preceding and serving as the source for 
breast malignancy.4 
The clinical literature also has suggested that the 
association may not be based on metastatic events 
but, rather, on common risk factors.5 This line of rea- 
soning follows from several pieces of evidence. First, 
both breast carcinoma and meningioma occur much 
more frequently in women than in men. Second, both 
tumors occur more frequently as age increases. In 
addition, increased tumor growth has been observed 
during pregnancy for both meningioma and breast 
carcinoma, 
suggesting hormone-induced stimula- 
tion.13 Recent efforts to determine shared genetic pre- 
disposition for these two types of neoplasms have 
provided more information but have neither dis- 
missed nor supported the reported link between the 
two tumors. In particular, although the BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 genes have been linked to familial and spo- 
radic forms of breast carcinoma, an analysis of BRCA1 
and BRCA2 genes in patients with sporadic meningi- 
omas has suggested that alterations of the BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 genes are not common pathogenetic events in 
the development of meningioma.13 
It is possible that an association between breast 
carcinoma and meningioma may be due to an overlap 
in the gene-environment interactions necessary for 
tumorigenesis. For both tumors, recent research has 
focused on loss of heterozygosity (LOH), or the loss of 
one allele in a tumor cell from a chromosome region 
for which individual normal cells are heterozygous: It 
is believed that LOH promotes tumorigenesis through 
a process whereby the expression of the disease occurs 
with the loss of the normal (or protective) allele 
through possible pathways, such as gene-environ- 
ment interactions or by environmental causes alone.14 
Two chromosomal regions, 1p13–p21 and 22q11– 
q13, frequently exhibit LOH in breast carcinoma, me- 
ningioma, and other types of tumor.15,16 At least three 
tumor suppressor inactivation genes have been iden- 
tiﬁed on the long arm of chromosome 22.15 Observed 
associations between breast carcinoma and meningi- 
oma may be due to the activation (or inactivation) of 
genes in these regions. However, the tumorigenesis 
pathways may diverge for breast carcinoma and me- 
ningioma, because other unrelated chromosomal re- 
gions have been proposed as critical events. For ex- 
ample, it is hypothesized that the 14q24 to 14q32 


region is the critical region responsible for immortal- 
izing cells, resulting in the most aggressive forms of 
meningioma, yet this region has not been implicated 
in the development of breast carcinoma.15 
Current genetic investigations and clinical reports 
appear to assume that an association between breast 
carcinoma and meningioma already has been estab- 
lished. However, the literature includes only six stud- 
ies that have sought to quantify the association be- 
tween primary malignancies and meningiomas.17–22 
Speciﬁc consideration of 
the association between 
breast carcinoma and meningioma has been reported 
in four studies (Table 1): Three of these studies found 
a signiﬁcant association between the two tu- 
mors.17,18,22 The other study did not ﬁnd a statistically 
signiﬁcant association.21 
The objective of the current study was to quantify 
the association between breast carcinoma and menin- 
gioma in women by using population-based data. The 
hypotheses tested were 1) that a diagnosis of breast 
carcinoma places a woman at increased risk for a 
subsequent diagnosis of primary meningioma and 2) 
that a diagnosis of meningioma places a woman at 
increased risk for a subsequent diagnosis of primary 
breast carcinoma. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
This study was a population-based, retrospective co- 
hort analysis. The study population included all the 
female residents age (cid:1) 15 years who resided in the 13 
counties of western Washington State, where the Can- 
cer Surveillance System (CSS) at the Fred Hutchinson 
Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) collects data on ma- 
lignant neoplasms and on some nonmalignant neo- 
plasms. The study period was 1992–1998. During the 
study period, the average total population of age-eli- 
gible women in the 13-county area was nearly 
1,473,000 women.23 
Since 1974, CSS has collected data on the inci- 
dence, treatment, and outcomes for all patients with 
newly diagnosed breast carcinoma. Since 1991, CSS 
has collected the same data for patients with primary 
meningioma. CSS data-collection staff members ab- 
stract data on (cid:1) 95% of patients with neoplasms, with 
the remaining data abstracted by hospital tumor reg- 
istry personnel. Diagnosis and treatment data are ob- 
tained from individual medical and hospital records. 
CSS staff members as well as Surveillance, Epidemiol- 
ogy, and End Results Program representatives carry 
out all case-ﬁnding and quality-control procedures.24 
The tumor registry collects conﬁdential information 
and assigns a unique number to each individual that 
includes a sequence code to identify additional neo- 
plasm diagnoses in the same individual. Follow-up

information is collected annually using data from a 
variety of sources, such as hospital records, the Wash- 
ington State Department of Motor Vehicles, the Health 
Care Financing Administration, Washington State 
death records, voter registration, Social Security infor- 
mation, and the National Death Index. To protect 
patient privacy, CSS did not provide the day of diag- 
nosis. Therefore, it was necessary to assume that all 
diagnoses occurred on the 15th day of each diagnosis 
month. Exact birth dates (day, month, and year) were 
provided. 

This study posed minimal risk to study partici- 
pants, because the cancer registry did not provide data 
that would permit identiﬁcation of individuals; there- 
fore, informed consent was not required by the Insti- 
tutional Review Board (IRB). After FHCRC IRB ap- 
proval of 
two data sets were 
provided. One contained information for all primary 
breast carcinoma diagnoses recorded by the registry 
since 1974. The other data set contained all primary 
meningioma diagnoses recorded by the registry. The 
meningioma data included incidental coding of me- 
ningioma diagnoses before 1991. If a person was di- 
agnosed with another primary malignancy and then 
developed meningioma, then reports of the meningi- 
oma diagnosis may have been submitted to CSS. Di- 
agnoses before 1991 are recorded in the CSS data but 
do not reﬂect complete surveillance for meningioma 
and, thus, were not used here. Each data set was 
reduced to primary diagnoses of the respective disease 
between 1992 and 1998. Although ascertainment of 
meningioma occurred starting in 1991, we decided in 
advance to exclude 1991 data to ensure the most com- 
plete ascertainment of each disease for every year of 
the study. Each of these data sets alone was used to 
determine the number of all primary breast carcino- 
mas and primary invasive breast carcinomas or pri- 
mary meningiomas, respectively. Using this method, 
two cohorts were deﬁned. The meningioma cohort 
consisted of 598 women who were diagnosed with any 
type of primary central nervous system (CNS) menin- 
gioma. Similarly, a breast carcinoma cohort was 
formed that consisted of 21,551 women who were 
diagnosed with any type of primary breast carcinoma. 
Because of the possibility that more aggressive breast 
tumors may be more likely to result in a subsequent 
diagnosis of meningioma, a subcohort consisting of 
18,349 women who had been diagnosed with primary 
invasive breast carcinoma also was identiﬁed. 
To determine the number of women who had 
diagnoses of both diseases, the original two data sets 
were linked using the unique cancer registry number 
from which the neoplasm sequence number had been 
removed. In linking the data sets, no restrictions on 
year of diagnosis were employed, and it was deter- 
mined that 35 women who were recorded in the reg- 
istry had diagnoses of both diseases. Subsequently, 
the data set was restricted to include only those 
women for whom the diagnoses of both primary 
breast carcinoma and meningioma occurred within 
the study period. Among the women in each of the two 
cohorts, 24 women had diagnoses of both primary 
CNS meningioma and primary breast carcinoma dur- 
ing 1992–1998. A total of three women with concurrent 
diagnoses (deﬁned as diagnoses of both meningioma 
and breast carcinoma within the same 30 day period) 
were excluded, because these women would have 
contributed to the counts for each disease but would 
not have contributed any length of time at risk (per- 
son-years) to the denominator of each incidence rate, 
arbitrarily increasing the relative risk estimates. No 
diagnosis of either disease occurred at autopsy. 
For women in the meningioma cohort, the length 
of time at risk (person-years) for breast carcinoma 
diagnosis was measured as the time from meningioma 
diagnosis to one of four possible end points: diagnosis 
of breast carcinoma, death, lost to CSS follow-up, or 
the end of the study (December, 1998). Similar meth- 
ods were used to determine person-years at risk for 
women in the breast carcinoma cohort and in the 
invasive breast carcinoma subcohort. 
To determine the expected number of patients 
with the relevant second tumor, we calculated popu- 
lation rates of primary meningioma, primary breast 
carcinoma, and primary invasive breast carcinoma in 
western Washington State women using CSS data for 
1992–1998 and using intercensal population estimates 
provided by the Washington State Department of 
Health as the population person-years at risk.23 The 
summation of the annual intercensal population esti- 
mates from 1992 through 1998 represents the total 
accumulated person-years at risk. Washington State 
intercensal population estimates are reported as 
5-year age groups, so we were able to determine cor- 
responding age group speciﬁc incidence rates of all 
diagnoses. 
All data cleaning and analyses were performed 
using Stata statistical software (release 6.0; Stata Cor- 
poration, College Station, TX). The measure of associ- 
ation was the relative risk and is reported as the stan- 
dardized incidence ratio (SIR). We compared the 
observed number of breast carcinomas in the group of 
women who had ﬁrst been diagnosed with meningi- 
oma to the expected numbers of breast carcinomas 
among women with a diagnosis of meningioma. The 
expected number of breast carcinomas in the menin- 
gioma cohort was determined by multiplying 5-year 
age and calendar year strata of person-years at risk by 
the corresponding 5-year age group speciﬁc incidence 
rates of breast carcinoma in the female population. 
SIRs were calculated as the ratio of observed to ex- 
pected numbers of breast carcinomas using intercen- 
sal population estimates of women age (cid:1) 15 years 
living in the 13 county area of Washington State as the 
standard population. Exact 95% conﬁdence intervals 
(95%CI) were calculated with the assumption of a 


Poisson distribution for the data.25 We calculated SIRs 
for meningioma in the breast carcinoma cohort and 
the invasive breast carcinoma subcohort using the 
same method. 
RESULTS 
The age distributions for meningioma and for both 
breast carcinoma diagnoses in the study population 
were consistent with the currently accepted, descrip- 
tive epidemiology of both diseases (Table 2). The 
greatest number of diagnoses for each disease oc- 
curred in women age 50 – 80 years, even though they 
make up a relatively small percentage of the general 
population of adult women. The occurrence of both 
diseases in the same individual was most common for 
women age (cid:1) 65 years. Due to the race distribution in 
western Washington State, it was only possible to ex- 
amine associations between meningioma and breast 
carcinoma for white women. 
In the study, a total of 24 women were identiﬁed 
with diagnoses of both meningioma and breast carci- 
noma during the years 1992–1998. For 10 of these 
women, the diagnosis of breast carcinoma occurred 
ﬁrst; for 11 women, the diagnosis of meningioma oc- 
curred ﬁrst; and, for 3 women, we classiﬁed the diag- 
noses as concurrent (Table 3). For nonconcurrent di- 
agnoses, regardless of which diagnosis occurred ﬁrst, 
(cid:1) 70% of the women had the subsequent diagnosis at 
least 7 months after the ﬁrst diagnosis. Among women 
who were diagnosed with meningioma ﬁrst, 
the 
elapsed time until they were diagnosed with breast 
carcinoma appeared to peak after approximately 2 
years. For women who were diagnosed ﬁrst with pri- 
mary breast carcinoma, followed by meningioma, the 
elapsed time between diagnoses was distributed 
evenly over the 7-year follow-up. 
The greatest incidence of meningioma or breast 
carcinoma occurred in women between the ages of 50 
years and 80 years (Table 4). This relation was most 
evident for women in the breast carcinoma cohort and 
the invasive breast carcinoma subcohort, in whom the 
incidence rates were greatest between the ages of 50 
years and 79 years. The peak incidence rate for me- 
ningioma or breast carcinoma in the study population 
occurred in women age 65–79 years. 
The observed number of breast carcinoma diag- 
noses in the meningioma cohort was 11.0, whereas the 
expected number of breast carcinoma diagnoses was 
7.16. These values resulted in an SIR of 1.54 (95%CI, 
0.77–2.75) for the diagnosis of breast carcinoma in 
adult women after a previous diagnosis of meningi- 
oma (Table 5). The risk was greatest among women 
age 50 – 64 years; however, the conﬁdence intervals for 
all age speciﬁc risk estimates included 1.0.

a Pathologic classiﬁcation of tumor type was according to the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases for Oncology, second edition, 1990.26 
b General population percentage were based on Washington State intercensal estimates 1992–1998 (those age (cid:2) 15 years account for 21.5% of the total population). 
The overall estimate of the risk of a diagnosis of 
meningioma in women with a previous diagnosis of 
any breast carcinoma was 1.40 (95% CI, 0.67–2.58) 
(Table 6). Except for women age (cid:2) 34 years, the point 
estimates for the age group speciﬁc risk of meningi- 
oma indicated elevated risk, although the conﬁdence 
intervals were quite large and indicated that the re- 
sults were not statistically signiﬁcant. Even though the 
observed and expected numbers of meningioma diag- 
noses were small for each age group, there was a 
suggestion of increasing risk in older age groups. 
When the analysis was restricted to women with inva- 
sive breast carcinoma, the risk of a subsequent diag- 
nosis of meningioma increased from 1.40 to 1.64 (95% 
CI, 0.79 –3.02) (Table 7). Moreover, each age group 
speciﬁc estimate for women age (cid:1) 34 years increased, 
and the increased risk at older ages was maintained. 
Once again, although all age speciﬁc point estimates 
were elevated, the conﬁdence intervals included 1.0. 
DISCUSSION 
The CSS registry in Washington State is unique, in 
that, since 1991, data on the population incidence of 
the usually benign tumor, meningioma, have been 
collected. Therefore, western Washington State CSS 
data allowed for a population-based investigation of 
whether women who develop either primary menin- 
gioma or primary breast carcinoma have an increased 
risk of developing the other disease. Case reports of 
separate tumors occurring in combination are fre- 
quent, and it is difﬁcult to know whether these occur- 
rences are random events or represent an association 
between the tumors.27 In this study, the overall rela- 
tive risk point estimates ranged from 1.40 to 1.64. 
However, our results did not indicate statistically sig- 
niﬁcant associations between the risk of meningioma 
in women who were diagnosed previously with breast 
carcinoma or the risk of breast carcinoma in women 
who were diagnosed previously with meningioma. 
Data collection for this study occurred at a time 
when the use of advanced imaging techniques (com- 
puted tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) 
was increasingly common. The use of these imaging 
techniques has the potential to introduce bias, be- 
cause asymptomatic tumors are more likely to be di- 
agnosed, especially in persons with previously diag- 
nosed disease. Information bias that results when 
women who have been diagnosed with one disease are

followed more closely cannot be ruled out. In addi- 
tion, if medical monitoring is more intensive when a 
person is diagnosed with either breast carcinoma or 
meningioma, 
is expected that otherwise 
asymptomatic conditions would be diagnosed more 
frequently proximate to the ﬁrst diagnosis. A peak in 
second primary neoplasm diagnosis within the year 
after the ﬁrst diagnosis did not occur for either breast 
carcinoma or meningioma. 
The total period for the study was 84 months, and 
the diagnosis of subsequent meningioma or breast 
carcinoma after this time could not be assessed. Me- 
ningiomas are very slow-growing tumors.28 This study 
period may have been insufﬁcient to determine with 
accuracy a possible association between breast carci- 
noma and meningioma occurring many years later. 
Consistently, we detected an association between 
breast carcinoma and meningioma, but the study was 
limited by the number of women who experienced 
both tumors The combination of small numbers of 
women with both tumors and the potentially too short 
follow-up may explain the large conﬁdence intervals. 
This study also was limited in the analysis of spe- 
ciﬁc directions of disease (meningioma followed by 
breast carcinoma and breast carcinoma followed by 
meningioma). The diagnosis of each disease was used 
as the proxy measure of occurrence of the disease. 
With the available data, there was no way to determine

whether the presence of meningioma was occult and, 
thus, whether the occurrence of meningioma actually 
preceded the occurrence of breast carcinoma in the 
two breast carcinoma cohorts. 
Another limitation of the current study was the 
inability to account for women who no longer resided 
in western Washington State. The person-years at risk 
calculations were dependent on good ascertainment 
of vital status after a diagnosis of either condition. To 
determine whether migration out of the CSS data col- 
lection area may have resulted in underestimates of 
the person-years at risk, we examined U.S. Census 
Bureau migration patterns for Washington State. The 
most recently available migration pattern data cover 
the time period between 1985 and 1990.29 Among 
persons age (cid:1) 5 years, 74% resided in the same county 
of Washington State, and 84% continued to reside in 
Washington State. These statistics include persons of 
all ages (cid:1) 5 years; data restricted to adult populations 
were not available. It seems reasonable to assume that 
migration patterns are related to age and that children 
and young families constitute the greatest percentage 
of persons who change residence. For these reasons, it 
does not appear that migration out of western Wash- 
ington State, especially for older women, was an im- 
portant inﬂuence in our study. 
Annual vital status information was collected for 
68% of the women in the meningioma cohort. The 
reported mortality rate at follow-up was 23%. The 
mortality cause was not available from the CSS data 
unless it was from a neoplastic disease for which the 
registry collects data. It is assumed that the majority of 
observed mortality occurred as a result of age. Annual 
vital status information was collected for 94% of the 
women in the breast carcinoma cohort. The reported 
mortality rate at follow-up was 20%. We assumed that 
all women contributed fully to the person-time during 
follow-up unless they were deceased. Succinctly, the 
follow-up end point of mortality was well ascertained, 
but loss to follow-up due to migration would have 
resulted in an overestimate of the true person-time 
under surveillance for the second tumor; hence, the 
SIRs would be underestimated. However, because the 
results suggested moderately elevated risks, loss to 
follow-up did not appear to be a driver of the analytic 
results. 
By deﬁning the study period as 1992–1998, we 
intended to assess accurately the accumulated per- 
son-time at risk. The exclusion of diagnoses that oc- 
curred outside the study period was necessary to pre- 
vent bias caused by the accumulation of time at risk 
only for those women who had been diagnosed with 
one of the diseases and not for all of the women who 
had been diagnosed with both breast carcinoma and 
meningioma. This restriction resulted in a reduction 
in the number of women with diagnoses of both dis- 
eases from 35 women to 24 women. These small num- 
bers of women had a prominent inﬂuence on this 
analysis. Although the point estimates suggest an as- 
sociation, the 95%CIs represent a large range of pos- 
sible results. A future analysis using additional data 
from other cancer registries or the same data, but over 
a larger study period, would be helpful in improving 
conﬁdence in the risk estimates. 
The current study adds further evidence to the 
suggestion that, if the two tumors are related, then it is 
probably only because they share common risk fac- 
tors. None of the risk estimates reported here is sufﬁ- 


ciently different to indicate a speciﬁc pathway of as- 
sociation. For example, if meningioma is a risk factor 
for the development of breast carcinoma, but not the 
reverse, then one would expect that the relative risk of 
breast carcinoma in the meningioma cohort would be 
notably larger than the risk of meningioma in the 
breast carcinoma cohorts. 
The shared risk factors hypothesis suggests that 
the tumors are not associated causally. Rather, any 
association between the two tumors rests on nonspe- 
ciﬁc mechanisms, such as age, gender, hormone in- 
duction, and possibly other demographic characteris- 
tics that are common to both tumors. The results from 
studies by Helseth et al. and Jacobs et al. suggested a 
nonspeciﬁc mechanism of association.17,21 Jacobs et 
al. did not ﬁnd evidence for a statistically signiﬁcant 
association for the risk of breast carcinoma in women 
who were diagnosed with meningioma (standardized 
mortality ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.74 –2.50). The estimate 
presented here was similar (SIR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.77– 
2.75). Helseth et al. reported a signiﬁcant association 
between breast carcinoma and meningioma when 
breast carcinoma was diagnosed ﬁrst (SIR, 1.75; 95% 
CI, 1.08 –2.68). The association when meningioma was 
diagnosed ﬁrst was nearly signiﬁcant (SIR, 1.54; 95% 
CI, 0.97–2.34). However, none of the age group speciﬁc 
relative risks reported by Helseth et al. were signiﬁcant 
except for women age 50 – 64 years who were diag- 
nosed with meningioma ﬁrst. Because all of the risk 
estimates reported by Helseth et al. represent approx- 
imately the same level of association regardless of 
which disease was diagnosed ﬁrst, that study tends to 
support an association on the basis of shared risk 
factors. 
In the study by Helseth et al., 9 of 12 meningiomas 
were incidental ﬁndings at autopsy.17 Those tumors 
did not represent medically evident conditions that 
lead to diagnosis or treatment, and it is possible that 
the inclusion of such diagnoses at autopsy produced 
the statistically signiﬁcant relative risks. In contrast, all 
of the meningioma diagnoses in the current study 
were me from living women who contributed to the 
person-years at risk in the appropriate cohort even if 
they were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. 
Emry found a large increased risk of meningioma 
in women who were diagnosed previously with breast 
carcinoma (observed/expected ratio, 3.5; P (cid:2) 0.001), 
whereas the risk of breast carcinoma in women who 
were diagnosed with meningioma was not signiﬁcant 
(observed to expected tumor ratio, 1.1; P (cid:1) 0.05).22 
The Emry study relied on Los Angeles County Cancer 
Surveillance Program (CSP) data: At the time of that 
study, CSP data only included incidence of meningi- 
oma and/or breast carcinoma. Follow-up data were 


not available, and it was necessary to model the per- 
son-years at risk using SEER cancer rates for the U.S. 
population and estimates of mortality. In our study, 
follow-up data, including mortality, were available for 
all individuals who continued to reside in Washington 
State, and the population rates for all diseases were 
determined using the registry data and the intercensal 
population estimates from which the diagnoses arose. 
The statistical association between breast carci- 
noma and meningioma was reported ﬁrst by Schoen- 
berg et al., who published an observed to expected 
estimate of 1.76 (P (cid:2) 0.05).18 In that study, only the 
association between the two diseases was examined, 
that is, the diagnosis of either breast carcinoma or 
meningioma followed by the diagnosis of the other 
disease was included in the same risk calculation. In 
addition, the estimate was based on a small number of 
observed tumors (8) and expected tumors (3.4), and 
the results represent one of the few signiﬁcant asso- 
ciations from several comparisons of many different 
tumor combinations. 
The published case reports of meningioma and 
breast carcinoma in the same individual suggest that 
the pathologic classiﬁcation of the ﬁrst tumor may 
inﬂuence the risk of the occurrence of the second 
tumor. This reasoning seems logical, in that a more 
aggressive tumor may be more likely to metastasize. 
Speciﬁcally, the CNS is a common metastatic site for 
breast tumors.22 Pathologic conﬁrmation of tumor 
type is collected in the CSS registry. Of the 24 women 
for whom the diagnoses of breast carcinoma and me- 
ningioma occurred during the study period, 22 menin- 
giomas were classiﬁed as benign (the tumor type was 
missing for 2 diagnoses). For the breast carcinoma 
diagnoses, 4 women had in situ tumors, 18 women 
had malignant tumors, and 1 woman had a metastatic 
tumor. These breast carcinoma tumor types in the 
women with both diagnoses followed the same gen- 
eral distribution that was seen in the entire 21,551- 
member breast carcinoma cohort. Because more ag- 
gressive tumors are no more common in women with 
diagnoses of both tumors than in women with only 
breast carcinoma or meningioma, the data suggest 
that tumor type probably is not related to the likeli- 
hood of developing of a second primary neoplasm for 
these two diseases. 
To assess whether the suggested risk factor for 
meningioma, radiation treatment, inﬂuences the like- 
lihood of the occurrence of both diseases, we exam- 
ined the treatment information contained in the CSS 
data base, including the type of surgery and various 
treatment modalities for women with a diagnosis of 
breast carcinoma. Treatment information for women 
with a diagnosis of meningioma is not collected ac- 
tively but is coded when available. When either breast 
carcinoma or meningioma is diagnosed ﬁrst, the treat- 
ment codes do not suggest that radiation treatment is 
a clear factor in subsequent risk of development of the 
other tumor. Of the 10 women who had a subsequent 
diagnosis of meningioma after a diagnosis of breast 
carcinoma, only 4 women were treated with beam 
radiation during breast carcinoma treatment, whereas 
6 women had no radiation treatment of any kind. This 
prevalence of beam radiation treatment in women 
who had both tumors is not signiﬁcantly different than 
for women in the entire breast carcinoma cohort. Of 
the 11 women who had a subsequent diagnosis of 
breast carcinoma after a diagnosis of meningioma, 2 
women were treated with beam radiation, 6 women 
had no radiation treatment of any kind, and 3 women 
had missing information. This pattern of beam radia- 
tion, no radiation, and missing data for women diag- 
nosed with meningioma and subsequent breast carci- 
noma is not signiﬁcantly different than for the entire 
meningioma cohort. The treatment code information 
does not suggest that radiation treatment is related to 
the subsequent risk of developing these second pri- 
mary neoplasms. 
The persistence of case reports on the suggested 
association and genetic investigation of the common 
tumorigenesis pathways continue. Several case re- 
ports have been published in the 1990s, with the most 
recent published in 1998.3,5,8,9,11 These case reports 
imply that a signiﬁcant association is present, whereas 
analytic studies have provided, at best, equivocal con- 
ﬁrmation of the association. Even though it was lim- 
ited by its small sample size, the current study sug- 
gests that any such association is probably modest. 
Further analysis using larger sets of population-based 
data that include longer follow-up may be necessary 
to fully detect this association. Shared risk factors may 
account for the relatively week bidirectional associa- 
tions seen in this study and in other studies.
