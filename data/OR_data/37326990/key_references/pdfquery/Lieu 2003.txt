Summary Breast carcinoma has a high predisposition to metastasize to the brain parenchyma. An association between carcinoma of the 
breast and intracranial meningioma has been reported. The available published articles regarding patients with intracranial meningioma and 
breast carcinoma have been reviewed. To the best of our knowledge, 86 cases including our 4 cases have so far been reported. All cases were 
female, and the mean age was 62.4 years when intracranial meningioma was diagnosed. The mean interval of the 2 tumours was 4.5 years. 
Twenty-ﬁve cases of breast tumour were inﬁltrating duct carcinomas. The location of intracranial meningioma and pathologic subtype showed 
no speciﬁc predominance. Hormone receptor study was performed in 28 cases. In meningioma, the positive rate of progesterone receptor 
(32.1%) is higher than oestrogen receptor (7.1%); while the positive rate of oestrogen receptor (53.6%) is higher than the progesterone receptor 
(42.9%) in breast cancer. A review of this study is presented with emphasis on the existence of intracranial meningioma and breast cancer in 
one patient at different periods. Lesions of the central nervous system in patients with breast cancer should not be immediately labeled as 
metastases. Intracranial meningioma should be excluded. Likewise, patients with meningioma should have periodic physical examinations and 
mammographies whereby disease may be diagnosed and treated at an early stage.

Breast carcinoma is considered a common malignant neoplasm in 
women. Patients with a history of breast carcinoma develop 
neurological symptoms and signs. Frequently, they are considered 
to have brain metastases and submitted to radiotherapy, quite 
often without any further investigation. However, multiple pri- 
mary tumours, benign or malignant, coexisting in the same patient 
occur with a frequency of 2.8% in patients with neoplasms.1–3 
Meningiomas represent 20% of all central nervous system tu- 
mours and are encountered twice as often in women as in men.4 
The existence of breast carcinoma and meningioma was sug- 
gested by Schoenberg et al. in 1975.5 An awareness of this exis- 
tence, with modern techniques of investigation, may permit more 
cases to be diagnosed and treated earlier. Herein, we present 4 
cases of intracranial meningioma and breast carcinoma, and a 
comprehensive review of the subject. 

During the period from January 1986 to May 1999, there were 4 
cases of intracranial meningioma associated with breast carci- 
noma, out of a series of 246 intracranial meningiomas operated on 
at the Kaohsiung Medical University. 

A 40 year old woman underwent a left modified radical mas- 
tectomy in February 1996 for carcinoma of breast. Hormonal 
receptor studies were positive for estrogen and progesterone 
receptors. Following surgery, the patient received adjuvant che- 
motherapy and radiotherapy. In October 1998, she was read-

mitted for progressive dizziness and vomiting. Brain computed 
tomography (CT) without contrast medium enhancement showed 
one isodense mass with calcification in the cerebellopontine 
angle. Infusion of contrast medium, revealed homogenous en- 
hancement. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed 
which raised suspicion of a meningioma. Craniectomy was 
performed with total removal of the tumour, which was subse- 
quently reported as psammomatous type of meningioma by 
pathologic studies. Oestrogen and progesterone receptor study 
were negative. 

This 60 year old women was admitted to our hospital in May 
1996, complaining of progressive weakness in her left limbs and 
unstable gait. Ten years prior, she underwent a left mastectomy 
for carcinoma of the breast. During hospitalization, brain CT 
scans demonstrated a well-defined mass in the right temporal 
region with moderate perifocal oedema. After contrast medium, it 
revealed homogenous enhancement. Craniotomy with total re- 
moval of tumour was performed. Histopathologic examination 
revealed it to be meningotheliomatous type. Oestrogen and pro- 
gesterone receptor assay was done. The results showed a positive 
response of progesterone; and, negative of oestrogen. 

This 42 year old woman suffered from focal seizure of right lower 
limb. Brain CT scans showed a well-defined mass in the left pa- 
rietal region with severe perifocal oedema and focal calcification. 
Homogenous enhancement was noted after infusion of contrast 
medium. A craniotomy was performed with total removal of a falx 
meningioma. The pathologic study demonstrated a meningiothe- 
liomatous meningioma. Progesterone receptor test was positive, 
and the estrogen receptor was negative. Four years and 5 months 
later, she was found to have a hard mass in the left breast. Biopsy 
showed infiltrating duct carcinoma. A modified radical mastec- 
tomy was done and negative nodes were found. She is doing well 
13 years after craniotomy. 



A 46 year old woman with a mass in the left breast had a 
modified radical mastectomy after biopsy, showing infiltrating 
ductal carcinoma. All nodes were negative. Eight years later, 
she began exhibiting poor memory and bizarre behavior which 
was reported by her family. Brain CT scans showed a huge 
mass with perifocal oedema in the left frontal region. After 
infusion of contrast medium, it showed homogenous enhance- 
ment. Bone window showed left frontal hyperostosis. A cra- 
niotomy was performed with total excision of 
the tumour. 
Pathologic examination demonstrated a meningiotheliomatous 
assay 
meningioma. Oestrogen 
showed negative study. She had an uneventful postoperative 
recovery. 




Between January 1986 and May 1999, 1853 patients with breast 
cancer underwent surgery in Kaohsiung Medical University. 
During this period, 246 patients underwent surgery for intracranial 
meningioma, giving a 1 to 7.5 ratio between intracranial menin- 
gioma and breast cancer, which is a considerably higher rate than 
that reported by Burns et al.6 and Smith et al.7 The interest in the 
existence of both breast cancer and meningioma is raised by the 
clinical relevance of an intracranial tumour discovered in a patient 
with history of breast cancer and the need to differentiate it from a 
metastasis.8;9;10 
Published articles were reviewed and they revealed 82 case 
reports of patients with both breast cancer and meningioma, to 
which we have added 4 cases. The clinical details of these are

summarised in Table 1. The mean age of presentation for patients 
with intracranial meningioma was 62.4 years, and mean age for 
patients with breast cancer was 56.2 years. This age is typical of 
patients with either intracranial meningioma or breast cancer. 
Breast cancer was diagnosed first in 80.2% of cases and the mean 
duration before the diagnosis of the second tumour, be it breast 
cancer or intracranial meningioma, was 4.5 years. The longest 
interval between tumour diagnoses was 29 years.18 The trend of 
breast cancer presentation first, which is also reflected in 3 of our 
4 patients, may simply reflect the slow growth of intracranial 
meningioma. The location of intracranial meningioma was as 
follows: convexity (23 cases), sphenoid ridge (15), parasagittal/ 
falx (7), olfactory (4), others (18) and unknown (21). The subtype 
of meningioma was as follows: meningotheliomatous (17), 
psammomatous (12), transitional (10), fibroblastic (5), mixed (2) 
and no classification (40). The location and subtype of intracranial 
meningioma revealed no specific predominance. 
Breast cancer and meningioma share several features that 
might account for their existence in 1 patient. From epidemiologic 
survey, both tumours occur commonly in the same adult female 
population, usually in the fifth and sixth decade; which is similar 
to those in our review.4;29 From the viewpoint of clinical course, 
intracranial meningioma express symptoms rapidly, with an in- 
crease in size during pregnancy and a complete clinical subsi- 
dence postpartum.30;31 It has yet to be clarified as to whether the 
increase in size is due to an expedition of the rate of growth, in- 
fluenced by hormonal changes during pregnancy, or to an in- 
creased fluid content, based on the generally increased water 
retention during pregnancy.5;11;30;31 
Breast cancer cells often express oestrogen and progesterone 
receptors.32 In meningioma, oestrogen receptors had been detected 
initially, but progesterone receptors were later documented in 
higher tissue concentration.33–35 In fact, quantitative assessment of 
these hormone receptors usually yielded twice as many proges- 
terone receptors as oestrogen receptors in meningiomas.34;36 In 
breast cancer, the cytoplasmic progesterone receptors are usually 
elevated when cytoplasmic oestrogen receptors are present in high 
levels.17 Therefore, the hormone receptor status of meningioma 
appears to be different from that of breast cancer. This discrep- 
ancy suggests a possible derangement of the normal cellular 
hormonal control mechanism in meningioma.17 In our 4 menin- 
gioma cases, progesterone receptor tests were positive in 2 pa- 
tients, and oestrogen receptor tests were all negative. Among the 
86 reviewed cases, including our 4 cases, hormone receptor tests 
were performed in 28 cases. Regarding intracranial meningioma, 
the progesterone receptor tests were positive in 9 cases (32.1%), 
and oestrogen receptor tests were positive in only 2 cases (7.1%). 
This incidence is similar to the report of Cahill et al.,34 but is 
lower than other authors’ reports.35–38 In breast cancer, oestrogen 
receptor positive rate (53.6%) is higher than the progesterone 
receptor rate (42.9%), but is of no significant difference. 
Jacobs et al.18 and Salvati et al.12 suggested sphenoidal ridge 
meningiomas were more likely to be associated with breast can- 
cer. However, in our study the association was not apparent. 
Onset and types of neurologic symptoms and signs can not be 
used to distinguish between metastatic breast cancer and intra- 
cranial meningioma, since they are similar. Brain CT scans and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful (Table 2). On 
brain CT scans and MRI, metastasis of the breast cancer shows as 
outward expansion of the gray/white matter junction (intra-axial 
lesion) rather than inward buckling by the intracranial meningi- 
oma (extra-axial lesion). Extensive perifocal oedema is present 
with metastasis, whereas this is not common in intracranial me- 
ningioma. Bone destruction is found in metastasis, but in intra- 
cranial meningioma, hyperostosis may be seen. On enhanced 
MRI, intracranial meningiomas undergo homogenous enhance- 
ment with linear enhancement along the dura adjacent to the tu- 
mour (meningeal “tail”).39 
In summary, intracranial meningioma and breast cancer usu- 
ally occur in the same age groups; therefore, the physician should 
be aware of the possibility of the existence of both breast cancer 
and intracranial meningioma. The findings of cerebral mass in a 
patient with breast cancer should not definitively indicate metas- 
tasis. Resectable intracranial meningioma should be diagnosed 
differentially. Likewise, patients with intracranial meningioma 
should have periodic physical examinations and mammographies, 
by which disease may be diagnosed and treated at an early stage.
