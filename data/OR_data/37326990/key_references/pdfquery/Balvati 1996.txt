Nine patients with diagnosed breast cancer who developed 
meningiomas are reported. Articles suggesting that an asso 
ciation of these two tumors is possible, Some authors have 
noted hormonal sensivity and the presence of hormonal re 
ceptors in some meningiomas. Since breast cancer is the me- 
st common tumor in women, an association between it and 
meningiomas might be fortuitous. However, it is important to 
fUlly investigate brain lesions in patients with breast cancer 
so that potentially curable meningiomas are not considered 
as metastases,

Brain metastases are found in 37% to 57% of breast 
cancer patients at autopsy": meningiomas overall con 
stitute 20% of all brain tumors. Burns et a1.3 found that 
for every case of meningioma in patients with breast 
cancer, 54 had metastatic disease as the cause of their 
intracranial mass, Schoenberg et a1.21 
, in an epidemiolo 
gic study of CNS neoplasms and primary malignancies 
in other sites from the Connecticut Tumor Registry, 
suggested that in the case of breast carcinoma and me 
ningioma the number of observed second primary tu 
mors exceeded the number expected (8 observed cases 
vs 3.7 expected cases, P<0.05). However, Schoenberg 
et a1.21 based the conclusions on a small number of ca 
ses (n=8) and comparisons of many tumor combina 
tions. The association has been pointed out by Posner" 
(study on 324 cases) and by other authors in individual 
Breast cancer is a common neoplasm in women, ac 
counting for 28% of all cancers2

• Likewise, meningio 
• 
mas are common benign neoplasms encountered twice 
as often in women as in men. In 1975, an association 
between these two tumors was suggested by Schoen 
berg et a1.21 
• Rubistein et a1. 20 reviewed numerous arti 
cles suggesting that an association of the two neoplasms 
is more common than expected, The occurrence of 9 su 
ch neoplasms in our Division over a 14-year period 
prompted the study, 

Between 1980 and 1993,263 women with meningio 
mas were surgically treated in our Division (Table 1), 
Twenty of them had additional tumors that included 9 
breast cancers, 5 genital cancers, 3 hematopoietic mali 
gnancies, 2 lung cancers and 1 melanoma, 
Estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) assays 
were carried out on routine sections of breast and me 
ningeal tumors cut from field paraffin blocks. Sections 
of breast cancer and meningioma were rehydrated and 
initially digested using DNAase for 30 min at 37°C, 
followed by incubation with primary monoclonal anti 
bodies direct against ER and PRo All breast cancers we 
re positive for ER, whereas only 2 were positive for PRo 
All meningeal tumors were negative for ER and 4 were 
positive for PRo 
Breast cancer and meningiomas were classified and 
graded according to the WHO classification. The clini 
cal and histologic characteristics and outcome of the 9 
patients are reported in Table 2,

reported cases6.1J.J3.16.17.20.21.23. However, in larger menin 
gioma series7.12.18.25 there was no mention of concurrent 
breast carcinoma and meningioma. 



Both tumors occur in a similar age group (5th-6th de 
cade). Onset and types of neurologic symptoms and si 
gns cannot be used to distinguish between metastatic 
breast carcinoma and intracranial meningioma because 
h 
t ey are SImI ar '. 
omputerized tomography (CT) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful (Ta 
ble 3). The following findings are very important: on 
CT scan, metastasis of the breast is outward expansion 
of the gray/white matter junction rather than inward 
buckling by the extracranial meningioma; abundant sur 
rounding cerebral edema is present with metastasis, 
whereas this is not common with meningioma; bone de 
struction, rather than hyperostosis, is suggestive of me 
tastasis; on enhanced MRI meningiomas undergo inten 
se enhancement with a small amount of linear enhance 
ment along the dura adjacent to the tumor ("tail"). 
Previous studies have suggested an association becau 
se both are ER and PR positive in a high percentage of 
cases, both would appear to be hormone dependent for 
their development and growth, and both have been mani 
fested as collision tumors, in which the breast carcinoma 
has metastasized to the meningioma. Many authors 4 
.5.10 
have recently documented that the ER\PR profile menin 
gioma substantially differs from that customarily seen in 
breast cancer; unlike breast cancer, meningiomas are mu 
ch more commonly positive for PR than for ER. Kozbor 
and Croce" reported that amplification of the c-myc on 
cogene may be induced in both tumors; however, the c 
myc oncogene is enhanced several-fold on exposure to 
estrogen. The human PR gene shares the same location 
as the mammary oncogene int-2 in chromosomal band 
llq1315. Such a proximity is believed to explain the role 
of progesterone in breast cancer, but the role of oncoge 
ne, int-2 in the genesis of meningiomas is not yet known.

meningioma was found on the sphenoidal ridge. Com 
pared with all meningioma patients (263 cases), those 
with breast cancer were more likely to have sphenoidal 
ridge meningiomas (67% vs 11%; P=O.36). All breast 
cancers were positive for ER, whereas only 2 were po 
sitive for PRo Our meningiomas were negative for ER, 
whereas 4 sphenoidal meningiomas were positive for 
PRo Such data confirmed the different ER\PR profile of 
tumors and the hypothesis that sphenoidal ridge menin 
gioma and breast cancer may represent a unique con 
stellation of neoplasms in women".
