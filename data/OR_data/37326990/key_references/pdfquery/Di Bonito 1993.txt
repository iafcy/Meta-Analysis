We report 12 new cases of female breast cancer associated with intracranial meningiomas, 
inclusive of autopsy study. At the time of death the patients' age ranged from 52 to 95 years 
(average 70.6 years). Breast carcinomas were documented ante mortem in 11 cases and at 
autopsy in 1. Meningiomas were diagnosed at autopsy (10 cases) or in vivo (2 cases). The 
diagnosis of meningioma antedated that of mammary carcinoma in only one patient. 
Histologically, the cancers were of ductal (11 cases) and lobular infiltrating (1 case) types 
and showed a variable malignancy grade. Widespread extracranial metastases were 
present at autopsy in 7 cases. Brain metastases were seen in 1 case. Neurologic signs were 
referred in 4 subjects. Four breast cancers and one meningioma showed immunoreactivity 
for progesterone receptors, whereas all the cases were negative for estrogen receptors. 


A brief review of the literature, which includes 14 similar observations, is reported. 
Although the association of breast cancer and meningioma is still difficult to explain, its 
clinical implications are important and deserve proper attention. A proper work up in 
patients with suspected intracranial metastases is recommended so that resectable 
meningiomas are not mistaken for metastases. 

In 1977 and 1980 we documented at our Institute a few 
cases of carcinoma of the female breast associated with 
meningioma of the cranial dura mater7, 11. On the basis of 
clinical and autopsy data available at that time we 
suggested that more than a casual relationship, most likely 
on endocrine basis, existed between these two apparently 
unrelated lesions although no definite proof could be 
brought in order to substantiate our initial impression. 
In the last decade numerous cases of this unusual 
association have been added to the already published ones. 
In most instances the meningiomas, discovered either ante 
mortem or at autopsy, had followed the breast tumor at a 
variable interval. In a few cases, the meningeal tumor 
contained metastatic cells from the breast cancer. Mean 
while, studies on functional as well as biochemical features 
of meningiomas, supported also by steroid receptor assays, 
have indicated possible molecular mechanisms, to explain 
the simultaneous occurrence of the two neoplasms in the 
same patient as well as the rare phenomenon of tumor 
in-tumor growth. 
In view of these new insights, we have reviewed all the 
new cases thereafter documented at our Department, 
including autopsy and surgical observations of breast 
cancer and meningioma. 




For the present study we have reviewed the cases of female 
breast cancer in which a meningioma had been found before or 
after the mammary tumor. For this purpose we retrieved all the 
cases seen between 1980 and 1989 at the Department of 
Anatomic Pathology either in life or at autopsy, using our 
computerized archive implemented since 1980. Clinical charts 
were also reviewed in order to obtain proper information on 
symptoms, signs, therapy and survival. Tissues from autopsy and 
surgical specimens included hematoxylin-eosin stained sections 
from routinely processed material initially fixed in 10 % neutral 
buffered formalin, with final embedding in paraffin. 
Breast cancers were classified and graded according to the 
WHO scheme using sections from surgical material obtained 
during operating room consultation2• 


Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesteron receptor (PR) assays 
were carried out on routine sections of breast and meningeal 
tumors cut from filed paraffin blocks, selected among those 
showing better cell preservation. Sections of breast cancer and 
meningioma were rehydrated and initially digested using DNAase 
(10 U/ml) for 30 min at 37°C, followed by incubation with 
primary monoclonal antibodies directed against ER and PRo The 
DNAase has been donated by the "Area" Research Laboratory, 
Trieste; prediluted anti-ER and PR antibodies were purchased 
from Abbott. Treatment with secondary antimouse antibody 
followed after repeated washings in phosphate buffered saline. 
The peroxidase anti peroxidase method was used as a revealing 
system with diaminobenzidine as chromogen and Harris' hema 
toxylin for nuclear counterstain. 



During the 10-year interval a total number of 25,055 
autopsies were performed. In the same period 1,413 new 
cases of breast cancers (nearly all diagnosed on surgical 
material) and 64 meningiomas were accessioned. The 
association between breast cancer and meningioma has 
been documented in 12 patients (Table 1). The age of the 
patients at the time of death averaged 70.6 years, ranging 
from 56 to 95 years. 
In 11 patients the breast tumor was diagnosed in life: in 
these subjects the age ranged from 51 to 80 years and 
survival after surgery lasted from 1 to 8 years. One patient 
(case 10) underwent bilateral mastectomy. In most cases, 
breast carcinomas belonged to the ductal infiltrating 
category with a variable histological grade. In one patient 
the histological material was not available for review. 
The testing for ER was negative in all cases, whereas PR 
assay was positive in 4 breast tumors and dubious in 
one. 
All the meningeal tumors were intracranial. They were 
found incidentally at autopsy in 10 cases. In 2 patients, 
however, they were documented in life following one and 2 
years respectively after the breast operation. Histological 
ly, they were psammomatous in 7 cases, transitional in 3, 
mixed in 2.

In one patient the meningeal tumor contained metastatic

were negative for ER and PR, except one case in which a 
slight nuclear positivity was found for PR: this corres 
ponded to a transitional meningioma with nuclear pleo 
morphism (Figs. 2 and 3). 

The association of carcinoma of the breast, the most 
frequent malignant tumors in females, and meningioma, a 
common neoplasm of the central nervous system, has been 
pointed out by Schoenberg (1965) in a large series drawn 
from the Connecticut Tumor Registry and, later on, by 
reported 
other 
cases7, 8, 17, 19,24,25,26,30,33,35. Most of these articles have 
dealt with meningiomas occurring in the cranial cavity, but 
exceptionally a 
few spinal cord cases have been 
reported16,19. 



The simultaneous occurrence of multiple distinct tumors 
in the intracranial cavity and in other body sites is rare 
although not exceptional, being reported with an incidence 
of 2-8 % in patients suffering from malignancy25,26. 
In a limited number of articles the intimate association 
of breast carcinoma metastatic to a meningioma has been 
documented, sometimes supported by autopsy investiga 
tions (Table 2).

The general interest of the association between breast 
cancer and meningioma is, of course, raised by the clinical 
relevance of an intracranial mass discovered in a patient 
with history of breast cancer and the need of differentiating 
it from a metastasis17,21,24,3o. 
Several explanations have been claimed to elucidate the 
relationship between these two apparently distinct lesions. 
Although none is fully satisfactory, interesting observa 
tions have come from retrospective epidemiological sur 
veys indicating that both cancer of the breast and menin 
geal tumors occur in the same adult female population, 
usually in the 5th-6th decade. Thus, a response to a 
common hormonal influence has been suggested, as 
indirectly supported by the meningioma size fluctuation in 
conditions with high blood levels of estrogens and proges 
tins, such as pregnancy38. 
It is important to note that besides the well-established 
existence of ER and PR in breast carcinoma, many authors 
have recently documented, using various special tech 
niques, 
that meningiomas may have steroid recep 
tors9,12,23,29,32,37. ER had been detected initially, but PR 
were later documented in higher tissue concentration12. In 
fact, quantitative assessment of these hormone receptors 
usually yielded twice as much PR than ER in meningio 
mas9,29,37. From the qualitative standpoint, noteworthily, 
the ERIPR profile of meningiomas substantially differ 
from that customarily seen in breast cancer tissue: this 
might explain the rarity of the breast cancer-meningioma 
association as well as the uncertain role of hormone 
therapy for meningiomas9, 12,29,32,37. In vitro demonstra 
tion of androgen receptors in meningiomas has also been 
published28. 
Of interest in explaining this association are data 
obtained from molecular investigations focusing on the 
role of certain oncogenes in the development of breast 
cancer14, 22, 23. Whether the established enhancement of 
oncogene expression by estrogens in cell lines from breast 
cancer is paralleled by an analogous amplification in 
meningeal cells, is not known at the moment, and could 
represent a source of valuable information for future 
studies. 
Our data pertaining to the ERIPR assay are not com 
parable with those reported in the literature since most of 
the tested meningiomas were from an autopsy file. There 
fore, no definite conclusions can be drawn, even though - 
besides total negativity for ER - significant positivity was 
observed for PR in 4 breast cancers and one meningioma. 
However, positive meningeal tumor cells were not paral 
leled by analogous positivity in the correspondent breast 
cancer. Interestingly this unique PR positive meningioma 
was characterized by conspicuous bizarre nuclearity, in 
this confirming a phenomenon previously observed9,29. 
Clinical stage and grade of breast cancer as well as 
histology type did not correlate significantly with the 
development of the meningeal neoplasm. Likewise, the 
histology of meningioma appeared to be another inde 
pendent variable. 
In one of our patients a psammomatous meningioma 
harbored metastatic tissue from a ductal infiltrating 
carcinoma of the breast. The intracranial tumor was 

incidently discovered at autopsy in a 56-year-old woman 
treated with surgery for mammary cancer 5 years prior to 
death. She also received radio- and chemotherapy. 
To the best of our knowledge this is the 15th reported 
case of meningioma serving as a recipient for metastatic 
tumor implant. As in most previously published reports, 
widespread metastases were present in other sites (Ta 
ble 2). 
Several speculations have been claimed to explain the 
metastasis of a cancer in another primary tumor. Histori 
cally, renal carcinoma is a typical example of tumor host, 
most likely because it provides an optimal environment to 
blood-borne malignant cells4. In addition, a highly devel 
oped microcirculation may increase the chance of accept 
ing tumor cells from a different "donor" tumor. In the case 
of meningioma and breast cancer the association is still 
difficult to explain. 
Some authors believe that the association between the 
two entities is fortuitous, since meningioma may occasion 
ally be involved with other primary tumors such as cancer 
of the lung or testis8. The limited number of 15 cases seen 
during a 20-year interval at our Institute, where the 
autopsy rate of in-hospital deaths approaches 100 %, 
would lend some support to this view. Other investigators 
favor the hypothesis of a "low metastatic threshold" of 
meningioma due to its rich microcirculation or biochem 
ical composition (high lipidic content, especially of angio 
blastic forms)6,39. It is also possible that precise molecular 
factors, such as sex hormone affinity, account for a more 
specific cell-to-cell interaction and ultimately the tumor 
in-tumor growth. Whether antitumoral therapy might play 
a "permissive" role remains to be established. 
In conclusion, the occurrence of breast cancer and 
meningioma, simultaneously or at different times in 
patients with breast cancer, does not seem to be negligible 
although the intimate growth of the two neoplastic lesions 
is very rare. As breast cancer has the propensity to 
metastatize to the intracranial cavity, focal lesions detected 
in women with known mammary carcinoma should be 
properly evaluated to rule out a meningioma which is 
potentially resectable35.
