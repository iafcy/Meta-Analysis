series have calculated the relative risk for a
woman to develop an intracranial meningioma
while carrying a diagnosis of breast cancer (or
vice versa) to be between 1.5 and 2.0 (1, 3, 36,
60). Other studies have reported lesser degrees
of risk (25, 38). The most commonly proposed
explanation for this association involves the
hormonal receptors present in both tumors,
particularly meningiomas (5–8, 10, 11, 15,


17–19, 29, 31, 34, 37, 42, 47, 49, 50, 56, 67–69,
72). Indeed, variation in the levels of sex hormones in women has been reported to influence growth of meningioma (4, 35, 40, 45, 58).
Although the risk of breast cancer is many
times higher for women than for men, the risk
of meningioma is also higher for women than
men by at least 2-fold (23, 54). Whether androgen or estrogen receptor activity is responsible for the sex association is unclear, with some
investigators showing a similar expression
profile for these receptors in meningioma tissue taken from both men and women (43).
Male breast cancer is very rare, with an incidence of approximately 1 case per 100 000 in
the United States (33). The additional risk for
developing a meningioma is unknown, owing
to the relative rarity of both diseases in men. A

lack of association between these diseases in men would indicate a sex-specific phenomenon (possibly related to hormonal
levels, rather than hormone receptor expression). Conversely,
an increased risk of having both diseases in men would suggest
that factors unrelated to sex drive this association. Pooling data
from individual state cancer registries, we determined the incidence of breast cancer and meningioma separately in men and
in women and also identified patients diagnosed with both
diseases for comparison. Here, we show that the association of
breast cancer and meningioma in men is essentially nonexistent, but the association of these diseases in women is indeed
quite strong.

##### PATIENTS AND METHODS

This population-based study received approval from the Institu tional Review Board at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center. The state cancer registries of Arizona, Colorado, Massachusetts,
New York, and Texas were queried to identify patients with diagnoses
of breast cancer and meningioma. These 5 cancer registries were used
because they recorded disease-specific _International Classification of_
_Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) histology codes for breast cancer and_
meningioma in both male and female patients (30). These registries
were also able to provide numbers of patients per year diagnosed with
both diseases. Furthermore, these registries maintained these data for
the same time period (1995–2004) of at least 10 years. All registries
used are full and sustaining members of the North American
Association of Central Cancer Registries. These cancer registries obtain
information primarily from hospital reporting, pathology reports, and
death certificates, and they adhere to strict standardized criteria for
cancer registration (available at http://www.naaccr.org). In general,
these registries assign unique patient identifier numbers to keep track
of registered patients, thus enabling them to identify patients who are
diagnosed with each cancer type.
For meningioma, ICD-O codes 0, 1, and 3 were used; these codes correspond to benign, atypical, and malignant meningiomas, respectively.
For breast cancer, ICD-O codes 2 and 3, which correspond to in situ and
malignant cancers, respectively, were used. The population of each
state for each year studied was obtained from the United States Census
Bureau and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only adult
populations (18 years of age or older) of each state were used. Patient
data was de-identified by the cancer registry. Information on age and
race was not available from all registries. In the interest of patient confidentiality (given the relative rarity of having both diagnoses), the
specific dates of each diagnosis were unavailable; however, the year
each diagnosis was made was available.
The incidence rate of the second tumor (either breast cancer or
meningioma) was compared between identified meningioma and
breast cancer cohorts and the general population. The incidence rates
were calculated with the assumption that the population at risk was
followed for 1 year. On the basis of the independent incidence rates of
each cancer, an expected incidence rate of each tumor on an annual
basis was calculated. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was used
to determine the magnitude of the association between breast cancer
and meningioma. The SIR was defined as follows: SIR � _D/E, where_
_D is the observed number of events in the cohort, and E is the expected_
number of events in the cohort (12, 61). The exact 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated with assumption of a Poisson distribution for
the data (61, 62). The statistical analysis was performed using S-Plus 7.1
software.


##### RESULTS

Data on patients with breast cancer and meningioma were
available from the 5 cancer registries for a common 9-year
epoch from 1995 through 2003. During this period, a total of
6527 meningiomas and 153 599 breast cancers were diagnosed
in women (Table 1). During this same period, a total of 2327
meningiomas and 1668 breast cancers were diagnosed in men
(Table 2). The mean incidences (cases per 100 000) of meningioma and breast cancer in women during the study period
were 2.6 and 61, respectively. The mean incidences of meningioma and breast cancer in men during the study period were
0.96 and 0.69, respectively.
During the study period, 219 of the 6103 women already diagnosed with meningioma (3.6%) were diagnosed with breast cancer. The mean number of breast cancer cases diagnosed per year
in women who already had a diagnosis of meningioma was 24,
and the median was 28. The number of women with meningioma expected to develop breast cancer (on an annual basis)
during the study period ranged from 0.22 to 0.64, and the cumulative number of expected cases was 3.74 (Table 3). For the 9-year
period, the SIR of patients diagnosed with breast cancer in a
woman already harboring a meningioma was 58 (95% CI, 51–67).
The mean number of breast cancer cases diagnosed per year in
women with meningioma was 36, and the median was 37.
During this same time period, 320 of the 153 276 women already
diagnosed with breast cancer (0.2%) were diagnosed with
meningioma (Table 4). The expected number of women developing meningioma who already had a diagnosis of breast cancer
(on an annual basis) during the study period ranged from 0.23 to
0.66, and the cumulative expected number of cases was 4. For the
9-year period, the SIR of developing meningioma in a woman
already diagnosed with breast cancer was 80 (95% CI, 72–89).
During the study period, 1 of the 2327 men diagnosed with
meningioma (0.04%) was diagnosed with breast cancer. The mean
number of breast cancer cases diagnosed per year in men during
this period was 0.1, and the median was 0. During the study
period, the SIR for developing a subsequent breast cancer when
already diagnosed with meningioma was 0 for all years except
one (1999), in which the 1 case was identified. In this year, the SIR
was 443 (95% CI, 12–2785). The expected number of breast cancer
cases in men already diagnosed with meningioma was low, ranging from 0.001 to 0.003, with a cumulative expected number of
cases over the 9 years of 0.02 (Table 5). During this same period,
0 cases of meningioma were diagnosed in the 1667 men who
were already diagnosed with breast cancer. The expected number
of meningioma cases developing in male breast cancer patients
ranged from 0.001 to 0.003, and the cumulative expected number
of cases during the 9-year period was 0.02. The SIR for developing meningioma in men with an existing diagnosis of breast cancer was 0 for all years (Table 6).

##### DISCUSSION:

The association between breast cancer and meningioma has
been described in women, but there has been some debate


**484 | VOLUME 65 | NUMBER 3 | SEPTEMBER 2009** **www neurosurgery online com**

regarding the strength of this link. We queried 5 state cancer
registries to identify patients (male and female) diagnosed with
meningioma, breast cancer, or both diseases. Here, we show
that women with one disease are at increased risk of being
diagnosed with the other, when comparing the number of
expected cases with observed cases. However, this risk does not
appear to exist in men. These results suggest that the association between meningioma and breast cancer is a sex-specific
phenomenon.
Our results indicate that the link between meningioma and
breast cancer in women is stronger than previously reported.
The cumulative observed rate of breast cancer in patients
already diagnosed with meningioma was 80 times the expected
rate. Similarly, the cumulative observed rate of meningioma in
patients already diagnosed with breast cancer was 58 times the
expected rate. However, the link is not apparent in men with
either disease. We were able to identify only 1 case of a man
who developed breast cancer after being diagnosed with meningioma. No cases of meningioma were identified in men previously diagnosed with breast cancer.

This study draws upon a population of over 25 000 000
patients per year for each sex. This is the largest population
evaluated to determine the increased risk of developing meningioma in patients diagnosed with breast cancer and vice versa.
Despite the large population studied, there are limitations to
this analysis, and certain assumptions were made. For example,
for each year, it was assumed that the population of each state
remained stable. This assumption may be less appropriate for
Western states, such as Arizona and Colorado, which are
known to have higher migration rates. Although each state registry provided de-identified information on patients, including specific dates of diagnosis of each disease, it is unknown
whether or not these patients may have lived previously or
subsequently in a different state.
Breast cancer rates vary significantly between age groups
and racial groups in the United States. The highest rates are
seen in Caucasians, and the lowest rates are seen in Native
Americans. Racial differences were not taken into consideration, nor were age ranges, in our study. The incidence of breast
cancer increases with age, with incidences ranging from 1.4
cases per 100 000 in women of ages 20 to 24 years to 499 cases
per 100 000 in women aged 75 to 79 years. Indeed, our overall
breast cancer incidence of approximately 61 cases per 100 000
is somewhat lower than the typically reported rates of breast
cancer, which range from 120 to 140 cases per 100 000 (57).
Meningioma is considered a benign brain tumor and has,
until recently, not been consistently recorded in either national
or state cancer registries. As a consequence, we were limited to
the 5 state cancer registries we used in the study because they
maintained records of meningioma cases for several years.
Although the 5 states combined have a sizable population
(approximately 25 million per sex per year of the study), they
represent only approximately one-sixth of the total population
of the United States. Regional cancer rates may be higher or


_a_ _SIR, standardized incidence ratio; CI, confidence interval._

lower, and thus the generalizability of our results to the total
population of the United States may be limited.
Many patients harbor incidental meningiomas that are asymptomatic and may be followed rather than removed (53). This may
underestimate the true incidence of meningioma in this study,
given that imaging of the brain may not be performed in patients
with breast cancer unless they are experiencing neurological symptoms. Additionally, if a patient with either disease is diagnosed
and followed solely on an outpatient basis, then the patient may
not be captured by a cancer registry (a conceivable scenario in a
patient with a small, incidentally found meningioma). Conversely,
the increased vigilance in patients diagnosed with breast cancer
may have resulted in an increase in the diagnosis of incidental
meningiomas, thus artificially elevating the association of these
diseases. The reported incidence of meningioma in men and
women in the general population is estimated at 3.2 and 7.2,
respectively (20). Although the incidences we identified in our
study for meningioma were lower, we used data from 5 states,
whereas the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States
uses data from 19 states. Finally, although we were able to identify
which disease was diagnosed first (solely as a function of when the
disease was reported to the cancer registry), we do not know which
disease actually occurred first in these patients. For example, it is
possible that a patient may have been harboring an intracranial
meningioma for some time before a breast cancer diagnosis.
Although we report an increased risk in women of being diagnosed with one disease when already diagnosed with another, a
temporal association of these tumors, and any suggestion of one
tumor influencing the initiation and development of the other, is
dubious at best. Thus, we do not claim an increased risk of developing one tumor as a consequence of the other, only that an association of these diagnoses exists in women and not in men.
The results of our study lend support to the posture of
remaining vigilant for intracranial lesions in women diagnosed

with breast cancer. Although no such recommendation has
been levied by national cancer agencies, an increased index of
suspicion regarding an intracranial lesion may be warranted in
women diagnosed with breast cancer. Although our results
suggest an increased risk of breast cancer in patients diagnosed
with meningioma and vice versa, it may be difficult to justify
increased screening for breast cancer (beyond what is already
recommended for women in the United States) for women
diagnosed with meningioma. Any increased screening recommendation would likely come as a consequence of validating
these findings in a prospectively followed cohort of patients.
A definite limitation to the study is the relative rarity of breast
cancer in men, and this may be attributable to a low index of
suspicion for the disease (71). The incidence of breast cancer in
men in our study was less than 1 in 100 000. This low incidence
may have profound influences on statistical analysis. Thus, we
interpreted the 1 case of concomitant breast cancer and meningioma in the male population as lower than the expected number of cases during the 9-year time period. However, it is possible that even with a cumulative study period of 9 years, and an
expected incidence of 0.02 cases during this time, the time frame
used was not sufficient to adequately document the true incidence of the association. Indeed, the 1 case of breast cancer
occurring after meningioma in the male population (in 1999) has
a SIR of 443, demonstrating that very small numbers are sufficient to affect the results and subsequent conclusions of this
study. Conversely, there were 0 cases of meningioma being diagnosed after breast cancer in men.
The etiology of the apparent sex-specific phenomenon of this
association is unclear. Although hormone receptors have been
implicated in the development and progression of both tumor
types, it is difficult to know for certain what is behind the association of these tumor types in women. Meningiomas have long
been known to harbor both progesterone and estrogen receptors


(7, 19, 50). Progesterone receptors are more prevalent and more
biologically active, however, and are increased in recurrent
tumors, suggesting that they play a role in proliferation (59).
Estrogen receptors do not appear to play a significant role, as
evidence of their presence in meningiomas is much weaker (5,
10, 37, 50). In their study of progesterone and estrogen receptor
expression in meningiomas obtained from men and women,
Korhonen et al. (43) found an equal rate of expression of these
receptors in tumors obtained from both sexes. They concluded
that the higher incidence of meningioma in women could not be
explained by differences in receptor expression.
Similarly, breast cancers harbor estrogen and progesterone
hormone receptors, but the expression rate is somewhat variable, with the rates of expression commensurate with increases
in patient age (33). Male breast cancer has some similarities to
female breast cancer, including histological subtypes (although
lobular cancers are less common in men), but estrogen and
progesterone receptors are expressed at a significantly higher
rate, and _Her2-neu is expressed at a lower rate (26, 32, 33,_
73–75). Increased hormone receptors present in male breast
cancers seem to belie the lack of association with meningioma
seen in women; thus, despite our results supporting a significantly higher association of meningioma and breast cancer in
women, it is difficult to attribute this relationship definitively
to hormonal receptor differences between the sexes. Still, hormonal differences may be responsible, since women have a
much higher lifetime exposure to estrogen and progesterone
than do men. Thus, despite similarities in receptor expression,
hormone exposure may be the definitive difference and may
explain the apparent sex-related phenomenon.

##### CONCLUSION

This population study indicates that the association between
breast cancer and meningioma is very strong in women.
However, the same association was not observed in men. This
difference suggests that the association of these diseases is
peculiar to women. This phenomenon may be a consequence of
the higher cumulative exposure to hormones experienced by
women throughout their lifetimes.

##### COMMENTS

ao et al. pose an interesting question: is the coincidence of meningiomas and breast cancer tumors sex-specific? If there is an under## R
lying genetic mechanism linking the 2 tumors, the coincidence should
hold for males and females. Because of the low incidence of breast cancer in men, this question can be answered only by surveying a large
patient population. To this end, the authors reviewed the cancer registries in 5 states. They do a very good job of explaining the shortcomings of this approach.
Although the incidence of breast cancer was considerably lower in
men than in women, the authors were able to identify 1668 cases of
breast cancer in men. During the study period, 1 man with a known
meningioma was diagnosed with breast cancer. The expected incidence
for the study period was 0.02. The authors did find a robust relationship between meningiomas and breast cancer in women. No such relationship was found in men, although the authors point out that a
longer follow-up time might reveal a weak correlation. The reader
must wonder about the possibility of a beta error in this study. Is it possible that a larger population of men with breast cancer or a longer follow-up period would reveal a less robust coincidence in men?

he association between breast cancer and meningioma in women
has been appreciated for a long time. Quantification of the degree
## T
of this association has been lacking. This study addresses this need.
Although the weaknesses of a retrospective study of databases are real,
the authors appreciate them, acknowledge them, and account for them
as well as possible.
This study is a real contribution to my practice. I frequently treat
both of these diseases individually and sometimes in tandem in female
patients, and I will be able to tackle a discussion about their coincidence with real facts now. Even though meningiomas are sometimes
detected in patients with known breast cancer, these tumors are often
the last thing that a patient with breast cancer concerns herself with.
