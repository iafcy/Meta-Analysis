### Carcinoma of the Breast and Meningioma

###### Association and Management

DWIREF MEHTA, MD,' REZA KHATIB, MD, FACS,? AND SUBHASH PATEL. MD*

An association between carcinoma of the breast and meningioma has been recognized recently. Three
more cases are added to the few previously reported in the literature. An awareness of this association
together with modern techniques of investigation, particularly CAT scanning, may permit earlier di-
agnosis and treatment of more cases. Meningioma as well as carcinoma of the breast is more common
in women and the incidence of both tumors reaches a peak in the fifth and sixth decades. Both are
related to pregnancy and have an estrogen-receptor protein. Lesions of the central nervous system
following the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer are usually presumed to be metastatic. Therefore,
these lesions may be irradiated without complete clinical investigation. If the clinician is aware of this
association, appropriate diagnostic procedures could lead to the surgical removal of a benign menigioma.
Skull x-rays, bone scan, brain scan, CAT scan, and cerebral angiograms are useful in making a diagnosis.
Besides surgery, radiation therapy and hormonal therapy may play a role in the management.

and rapid progression of symptoms in patients with
meningioma was described by Cushing and Eisenhardt
in **1929.5 Since that time many authors have postulated**
that an acceleration in the growth rate of the tumor may
occur perhaps secondary to hormonal changes.6-8 The
epidemiologic factors and clinical course of some me-
ningiomas suggest that these tumors may be hormonally
sensitive. Donnell et aL9 reported the presence of the 4s
and 8s fraction of estrogen-receptor protein in their
study. Posner," in an autopsy based retrospective study
of 324 patients with end stage breast cancer, found four
cases of meningioma, and incidence of **1.2% which is**
