To determine whether nervous system neoplasms are associated with
primary malignancies elsewhere, we studied the frequency of multiple
primary tumors in patients in whom at least one of the primary tumors was
within the nervous system. The patients were Connecticut residents with
tumors diagnosed between 1935 and 1964. Of 135 patients, 130 had two
primary tumors, four had three primary tumors, and one had four primary
tumors. Only with multiple primary tumors involving the brain and breast did
the number of observed cases significantly exceed the number of expected
cases; eight patients who had a meningioma associated with a breast
cancer accounted for this excess. Patients with breast cancer presenting
with signs or symptoms of an intracranial neoplasm should be carefully
evaluated, for the intracranial lesion may be a potentially curable
meningioma.

The figures for expected cancer were then summed over
all age groups to obtain the total number of expected
cancers at each site. Using the same methods, it was
possible to determine the expected number of primary
nervous system neoplasms following primary
malignancies in other sites. The coded records of reported
cases of second primary cancers were selected and
matched by case number with the first primary cancers to
obtain the observed number of second primaries.
Since the probability ofa second primary cancer is very
small, the number of second primary cancers can be
expected to follow a Poisson distribution. A table of
significance factors for the ratio of a Poisson variable to its
expectationz6 was used to test the statistical significance
of the results. When the number of observed cases was
zero, statistical significance was tested with the values
given in a table of confidence limits for the expectation of
a Poisson variable.*’ The total Connecticut population

first primary cancer developed were subsequently
available for the estimation of the incidence of the second
primary cancer. The estimation of the incidence of first
primary cancers therefore has negligible error in
comparison with the estimation of the incidence of second
primary cancers, since the former estimate is based on a
much larger sample size.

associated with the 135 index tumor cases. The most
commonly involved sites outside the nervous system, in
order, were the digestive tract, breast, female genital
organs, and prostate.
The distribution by histologic type of microscopically
confirmed tumors involving the brain and cranial
meninges in patients with multiple primaries was
compared with the distribution of such neoplasms in all
patients.2s In comparison with the relative frequency in
the general population, there was a distinct increase in the
percentage of meningiomas and a corresponding decrease
in the percentage of the astrocytoma group of tumors
(p < 0.01) (table 7).
Simultaneously diagnosed neoplasms could not be
included in comparing the observed and expected
numbers of second primary cancers, because it was not
possible to calculate an expected number for this group of
tumors. Only in the case of multiple primary tumors
involving the breast and nervous system did the number of
observed second primary cancers significantly ex-
ceed the number expected (18 cases observed versus
10.25 cases expected; p < 0.05). All these 18 patients
were females. Tables 8 and 9 provide a more detailed
description of the characteristics of these tumors. The
patients’ age at diagnosis of the breast cancer followed no
consistent pattern. Of the 18 nonsimultaneously
diagnosed tumor pairs, each tumor in 14 pairs was
microscopically confirmed, and one of the two tumors in
the remaining four pairs was so confirmed. Eight cases of
a meningioma associated with a breast cancer accounted
for the excess of observed-over-expected second primary
cancers; only 3.37 such cases were expected (p < 0.05).

to examine certain possibilities for bias. For many of the

**(Connecticut, 1935 -1964)** In regard to the higher percentage of meningiomas

among patients with multiple primary cancers. one might
argue that since a patient with a meningioma has a longer
survival period than patients with other types of brain
tumors, other primary tumors may become manifest.
However, in the patients in the group with multiple
primary tumors who had nieningionias, nine of the
meningiomas were diagnosed at the same time that the
other primary was diagnosed, I7 were diagnosed after the
other primary. and only nine were diagnosed before
diagnosis of the other primary neoplasm. Thus, for the
majority of patients, the argument of longer survival
cannot explain the excess of meningiomas. since most of
these tumors were diagnosed at the same time or after the
other primary. Furthermore, in the analysis to determine
the expected number of patients with both meningioma
and breast cancer, the survival experience of all patients
with hreast cancer and all patients with meningioma was
taken into account.
The considerably higher percentage of meningiomas
found in the patients with multiple primary tumors might
reflect the fact that the rate of postmortem examinations is
higher in patients dying of cancer than in those dying of
other causes with no known neoplasm. Meningiomas that
