Summary Breast carcinoma has a high predisposition to metastasize to the brain parenchyma. An association between carcinoma of the
breast and intracranial meningioma has been reported. The available published articles regarding patients with intracranial meningioma and
breast carcinoma have been reviewed. To the best of our knowledge, 86 cases including our 4 cases have so far been reported. All cases were
female, and the mean age was 62.4 years when intracranial meningioma was diagnosed. The mean interval of the 2 tumours was 4.5 years.
Twenty-five cases of breast tumour were infiltrating duct carcinomas. The location of intracranial meningioma and pathologic subtype showed
no specific predominance. Hormone receptor study was performed in 28 cases. In meningioma, the positive rate of progesterone receptor
(32.1%) is higher than oestrogen receptor (7.1%); while the positive rate of oestrogen receptor (53.6%) is higher than the progesterone receptor
(42.9%) in breast cancer. A review of this study is presented with emphasis on the existence of intracranial meningioma and breast cancer in
one patient at different periods. Lesions of the central nervous system in patients with breast cancer should not be immediately labeled as
metastases. Intracranial meningioma should be excluded. Likewise, patients with meningioma should have periodic physical examinations and
mammographies whereby disease may be diagnosed and treated at an early stage.

INTRODUCTION

Breast carcinoma is considered a common malignant neoplasm in
women. Patients with a history of breast carcinoma develop
neurological symptoms and signs. Frequently, they are considered
to have brain metastases and submitted to radiotherapy, quite
often without any further investigation. However, multiple primary tumours, benign or malignant, coexisting in the same patient
occur with a frequency of 2.8% in patients with neoplasms.[1][–][3]

Meningiomas represent 20% of all central nervous system tumours and are encountered twice as often in women as in men.[4]

The existence of breast carcinoma and meningioma was suggested by Schoenberg et al. in 1975.[5] An awareness of this existence, with modern techniques of investigation, may permit more
cases to be diagnosed and treated earlier. Herein, we present 4
cases of intracranial meningioma and breast carcinoma, and a
comprehensive review of the subject.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

During the period from January 1986 to May 1999, there were 4
cases of intracranial meningioma associated with breast carcinoma, out of a series of 246 intracranial meningiomas operated on
at the Kaohsiung Medical University.

Case 1

A 40 year old woman underwent a left modified radical mastectomy in February 1996 for carcinoma of breast. Hormonal
receptor studies were positive for estrogen and progesterone
receptors. Following surgery, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In October 1998, she was read

mitted for progressive dizziness and vomiting. Brain computed
tomography (CT) without contrast medium enhancement showed
one isodense mass with calcification in the cerebellopontine
angle. Infusion of contrast medium, revealed homogenous enhancement. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed
which raised suspicion of a meningioma. Craniectomy was
performed with total removal of the tumour, which was subsequently reported as psammomatous type of meningioma by
pathologic studies. Oestrogen and progesterone receptor study
were negative.

Case 2

This 60 year old women was admitted to our hospital in May
1996, complaining of progressive weakness in her left limbs and
unstable gait. Ten years prior, she underwent a left mastectomy
for carcinoma of the breast. During hospitalization, brain CT
scans demonstrated a well-defined mass in the right temporal
region with moderate perifocal oedema. After contrast medium, it
revealed homogenous enhancement. Craniotomy with total removal of tumour was performed. Histopathologic examination
revealed it to be meningotheliomatous type. Oestrogen and progesterone receptor assay was done. The results showed a positive
response of progesterone; and, negative of oestrogen.

Case 3

This 42 year old woman suffered from focal seizure of right lower
limb. Brain CT scans showed a well-defined mass in the left parietal region with severe perifocal oedema and focal calcification.
Homogenous enhancement was noted after infusion of contrast
medium. A craniotomy was performed with total removal of a falx
meningioma. The pathologic study demonstrated a meningiotheliomatous meningioma. Progesterone receptor test was positive,
and the estrogen receptor was negative. Four years and 5 months
later, she was found to have a hard mass in the left breast. Biopsy
showed infiltrating duct carcinoma. A modified radical mastectomy was done and negative nodes were found. She is doing well
13 years after craniotomy.

Case 4

A 46 year old woman with a mass in the left breast had a
modified radical mastectomy after biopsy, showing infiltrating
ductal carcinoma. All nodes were negative. Eight years later,
she began exhibiting poor memory and bizarre behavior which
was reported by her family. Brain CT scans showed a huge
mass with perifocal oedema in the left frontal region. After
infusion of contrast medium, it showed homogenous enhancement. Bone window showed left frontal hyperostosis. A craniotomy was performed with total excision of the tumour.
Pathologic examination demonstrated a meningiotheliomatous
meningioma. Oestrogen and progesterone receptor assay
showed negative study. She had an uneventful postoperative
recovery.


DISCUSSION

Between January 1986 and May 1999, 1853 patients with breast
cancer underwent surgery in Kaohsiung Medical University.
During this period, 246 patients underwent surgery for intracranial
meningioma, giving a 1 to 7.5 ratio between intracranial meningioma and breast cancer, which is a considerably higher rate than
that reported by Burns et al.[6] and Smith et al.[7] The interest in the
existence of both breast cancer and meningioma is raised by the
clinical relevance of an intracranial tumour discovered in a patient
with history of breast cancer and the need to differentiate it from a
metastasis.[8][;][9][;][10]

Published articles were reviewed and they revealed 82 case
reports of patients with both breast cancer and meningioma, to
which we have added 4 cases. The clinical details of these are

summarised in Table 1. The mean age of presentation for patients
with intracranial meningioma was 62.4 years, and mean age for
patients with breast cancer was 56.2 years. This age is typical of
patients with either intracranial meningioma or breast cancer.
Breast cancer was diagnosed first in 80.2% of cases and the mean
duration before the diagnosis of the second tumour, be it breast
cancer or intracranial meningioma, was 4.5 years. The longest
interval between tumour diagnoses was 29 years.[18] The trend of
breast cancer presentation first, which is also reflected in 3 of our
4 patients, may simply reflect the slow growth of intracranial
meningioma. The location of intracranial meningioma was as
follows: convexity (23 cases), sphenoid ridge (15), parasagittal/
falx (7), olfactory (4), others (18) and unknown (21). The subtype
of meningioma was as follows: meningotheliomatous (17),
psammomatous (12), transitional (10), fibroblastic (5), mixed (2)
and no classification (40). The location and subtype of intracranial
meningioma revealed no specific predominance.
Breast cancer and meningioma share several features that
might account for their existence in 1 patient. From epidemiologic
survey, both tumours occur commonly in the same adult female
population, usually in the fifth and sixth decade; which is similar
to those in our review.[4][;][29] From the viewpoint of clinical course,
intracranial meningioma express symptoms rapidly, with an increase in size during pregnancy and a complete clinical subsidence postpartum.[30][;][31] It has yet to be clarified as to whether the
increase in size is due to an expedition of the rate of growth, influenced by hormonal changes during pregnancy, or to an increased fluid content, based on the generally increased water
retention during pregnancy.[5][;][11][;][30][;][31]

Breast cancer cells often express oestrogen and progesterone
receptors.[32] In meningioma, oestrogen receptors had been detected
initially, but progesterone receptors were later documented in
higher tissue concentration.[33][–][35] In fact, quantitative assessment of
these hormone receptors usually yielded twice as many progesterone receptors as oestrogen receptors in meningiomas.[34][;][36] In
breast cancer, the cytoplasmic progesterone receptors are usually
elevated when cytoplasmic oestrogen receptors are present in high
levels.[17] Therefore, the hormone receptor status of meningioma
appears to be different from that of breast cancer. This discrepancy suggests a possible derangement of the normal cellular
hormonal control mechanism in meningioma.[17] In our 4 meningioma cases, progesterone receptor tests were positive in 2 patients, and oestrogen receptor tests were all negative. Among the
86 reviewed cases, including our 4 cases, hormone receptor tests
were performed in 28 cases. Regarding intracranial meningioma,
the progesterone receptor tests were positive in 9 cases (32.1%),
and oestrogen receptor tests were positive in only 2 cases (7.1%).
This incidence is similar to the report of Cahill et al.,[34] but is
lower than other authors’ reports.[35][–][38] In breast cancer, oestrogen
receptor positive rate (53.6%) is higher than the progesterone
receptor rate (42.9%), but is of no significant difference.


Jacobs et al.[18] and Salvati et al.[12] suggested sphenoidal ridge
meningiomas were more likely to be associated with breast cancer. However, in our study the association was not apparent.
Onset and types of neurologic symptoms and signs can not be
used to distinguish between metastatic breast cancer and intracranial meningioma, since they are similar. Brain CT scans and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful (Table 2). On
brain CT scans and MRI, metastasis of the breast cancer shows as
outward expansion of the gray/white matter junction (intra-axial
lesion) rather than inward buckling by the intracranial meningioma (extra-axial lesion). Extensive perifocal oedema is present
with metastasis, whereas this is not common in intracranial meningioma. Bone destruction is found in metastasis, but in intracranial meningioma, hyperostosis may be seen. On enhanced
MRI, intracranial meningiomas undergo homogenous enhancement with linear enhancement along the dura adjacent to the tumour (meningeal “tail”).[39]

In summary, intracranial meningioma and breast cancer usually occur in the same age groups; therefore, the physician should
be aware of the possibility of the existence of both breast cancer
and intracranial meningioma. The findings of cerebral mass in a
patient with breast cancer should not definitively indicate metastasis. Resectable intracranial meningioma should be diagnosed
differentially. Likewise, patients with intracranial meningioma
should have periodic physical examinations and mammographies,
by which disease may be diagnosed and treated at an early stage.
