1 **Associated Risk of Subsequent Meningioma in Women with Breast Cancer**

3 **Abstract**

4 **Objective**

5 Despite the increasing evidence of the association between breast cancer and meningioma in

6 women, the relationship between these tumors remains improperly examined. In this study, we

7 aim to identify the socio-demographic and clinicopathological features of women with breast

8 cancer associated with a higher risk of developing a meningioma.

9 **Methods**

10 The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (18 registries) was used to identify

11 women with breast cancer as their first neoplasm. The risk of subsequent meningioma was

12 reported as the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and was analyzed by socio-demographic and

13 clinicopathological subgroups. Results are given as SIR [95% CI].

14 **Results**

15 A total of 564,516 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2004-2016 were included for

16 analysis. A 26% increased risk of meningioma development (SIR 1.26 [1.19-1.33]; P<0.05) was

17 found in the cohort compared to the general population. Patients between ages 18-49 (SIR 2.16

18 [1.78-2.61]; _P<0.05) and those with a more advanced tumor stage (Stage IV, SIR 2.39 [1.71-_

19 3.25]; _P<0.05) were at a higher risk. Hormone receptor expression and treatment modality_

20 subgroups were at a similar risk compared to the general population.

21 **Conclusion**

22 Our study corroborated the known association between these tumors and found a 26% risk of

23 meningioma development in women with breast cancer, with younger patients and those with a

24 more aggressive disease having a higher than expected risk.

27 **Introduction**

28 The postulated association between breast cancer and meningioma in women has been

29 increasingly described over the past decades.[1–9 ]Meningioma tumor growth during pregnancy,

30 physiologic changes in the menstrual cycle and use of exogenous hormones have pointed out the

31 shared risk factors by these two tumors.[1,2,4,10–14 ]Despite the growing evidence from retrospective

32 studies, the demographic, socioeconomic, and tumor characteristics of breast cancer patients that

33 may influence meningioma development remain largely unknown.

34 In the present study, we examined the overall risk of subsequent meningioma in breast

35 cancer patients, identifying socio-demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of breast

36 cancer patients associated with a higher risk compared to the general population and among

37 patients in the cohort.

38

39 **Methods**

40 _Study Population_

41 The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database of the National

42 Cancer Institute collects data on demographics, tumor features, treatment, and survival outcomes

43 from approximately 28% of the population in the United States.[15 ]The SEER 18 registries 2000
44 2016 (November 2018) was queried to identify cases of newly diagnosed breast cancer in women

45 from January 2004 to December 2016, as records of meningioma tumors in the SEER database

46 were not reliable or available until January 2004.

47 Breast cancer was defined by the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology,

48 third edition (ICD-O-3), coded as ICD-O-3 8500-8549 for ductal or lobular histology, malignant

49 behavior, and topography codes C500-C509. Meningioma was defined by ICD-O-3 codes 9530
50 9539, and a benign, atypical or malignant behavior. The exclusion criteria are presented in

51 **Figure 1. Patients were categorized in 2 main groups: those who developed breast cancer and**

52 meningioma (BC-M) and those who only developed breast cancer (BC).

53

54 _SEER Coding and Variable Definitions_

55 Patient socio-demographics extracted from the SEER database included age at diagnosis,

56 year of diagnosis, race/ethnicity, marital status, and insurance status (available since 2007). Age

57 was analyzed as an ordinal variable (18-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, >79 years). Clinicopathologic

2


-----

58 characteristics included tumor size, tumor stage (AJCC Cancer Staging Manual), estrogen

59 receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, HER2 status (available since 2010), and

60 histologic subtype. Borderline ER, PR, or HER2 statuses were considered as positive for

61 analysis. For records with tumor size coded as a range, the median was used for analysis (e.g.,

62 For a 0-20mm range, a 10mm size was assigned), while those with a possible miscoding (i.e.,

63 tumor size of 200mm or greater) were included in the unknown group.

64 Records with a diagnostic confirmation coded as “Radiography without microscopic

65 confirm” refer to cases diagnosed based on imaging alone (e.g., CT/MRI) without a positive

66 histology/cytology report. Data on the type of imaging modality used at diagnosis or during

67 follow-up are not available in the SEER database. Surgical procedures were identified using the

68 site-specific codes (SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2018) for breast and meninges

69 and were categorized into 6 groups, respectively.

70

71 _Subsequent meningioma development_

72 To assess the degree of association between breast cancer and subsequent meningioma,

73 the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was used and calculated as the number of observed

74 meningioma cases in the cohort divided by the number of meningioma cases expected in the

75 general population. Using the SEER*Stat MP-SIR session and SEER*Stat Rate session,

76 meningioma incidence referent rates were generated and used for calculation of the expected

77 number of cases adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and year of diagnosis. Multiple outcome

78 analysis was used for the SIR calculation to account for multiple tumor occurrence.

79 According to SEER, a synchronous tumor is considered to occur within 2 months after

80 the initial diagnosis of the first tumor. To be compliant with this definition, patients with

81 synchronous breast cancer and meningioma were excluded from our cohort using a 3-month

82 latency exclusion period. Thus, patients in the BC-M cohort were confirmed to have first

83 developed breast cancer followed by a meningioma at least 3 months apart from the initial breast

84 cancer diagnosis, ensuring the accuracy of the SIR calculation. The time at risk for meningioma

85 development was measured using person-years risk and was calculated to any endpoints

86 occurring as following: diagnosis of meningioma, loss of follow-up, death, or end of the study.

87

88 _Statistical Analysis_

3


-----

89 The Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson's chi-squared test were used to compare the socio
90 demographic and clinical features between patients in the BC group and BC-M group. Simple

91 linear regression was used to determine the trends in the diagnosis of breast cancer and

92 meningioma cases and the use of imaging alone vs microscopic/macroscopic evaluation in the

93 diagnosis of meningioma (see Supplementary Material).

94 To identify characteristics of patients that are more prone to develop a meningioma, we

95 stratified the cohort by age, race/ethnicity, marital status, insurance status, tumor stage, ER, PR,

96 and HER2 statuses, and clinical treatments to evaluate the individual risk of the subgroups.

97 Additionally, we examined the latency period from breast cancer diagnosis to the study endpoint.

98 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] for the SIR were calculated using the exact Poisson

99 method.[16] In addition, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using multivariable binary logistic

100 regression models to identify potential predictors of developing meningioma among the cohort

101 accounting for three sets of adjustments, respectively (see Supplementary Material).

102 Statistical analyses were performed with SEER*Stat software (MP-SIR session) for SIR

103 calculation (version 8.3.6; Surveillance Research Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda,

104 MD [http:// www.seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/]), Stata IC (Release 15.0, StataCorp, College Station,

105 TX), Prism 7 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA), and SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute). All p-values were

106 two-sided and considered statistically significant as P < 0.05.

107

108 _Ethics Statement_

109 This study was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (Committee for the Protection

110 of Human Subjects) and was determined to be exempt from review by the committee.

112 **Results**

113 _Study Population Characteristics_

114 Among 564,516 women identified with breast cancer as their first neoplasm between

115 2004-2016, the median age at diagnosis was 60 years [IQR, 50-70 years], and 69% were non
116 Hispanic White. The most common breast cancer histology subtype was infiltrating ductal

117 carcinoma, and 78% and 67% of patients had a positive ER and PR expression status,

118 respectively. 44% had a HER2 negative status in the cohort, and among patients in the 2010
119 2016 subset, 79% had a negative HER2 status. Patients in the BC-M cohort were older (BC vs

-----

120 BC-M, 60 years vs 63 years; _P<0.001), more commonly non-Hispanic White (BC vs BC-M,_

121 69.1% vs 74.1%; _P<0.001), and more often treated with radical mastectomy (BC vs BC-M,_

122 19.1% vs 23.1%; _P<0.001). Socio-demographic and tumor characteristics of breast cancer_

123 patients in the cohort are described in Table 1.

124 Of 1,159 patients in the BC-M group, the majority were between 50-59 years of age

125 (28%) and were non-Hispanic White (74%). Meningioma histologic subtype was not specified in

126 88% of patients, over half of patients had a meningioma tumor size between 10-50 mm, and 2%

127 had meningiomatosis. 759 (64%) patients were diagnosed based on radiology findings alone

128 while 399 (34%) patients were diagnosed either by macroscopic (i.e., direct visualization) or

129 microscopic examination (i.e., positive histology). Treatment strategies included surgical

130 resection and radiotherapy in 30% and 8% of patients, respectively. Socio-demographic, tumor

131 features and clinical treatments of patients in the BC-M group are detailed in Table 2.

132

133 _Standardized Incidence Ratio of Meningioma_

134 The cohort was followed for a total of 2,894,335.68 person-years and the SIR for

135 meningioma was 1.26 (95% CI [1.19-1.33]; P<0.05), representing a 26% increased risk in the

136 cohort when compared to the general population. This finding remained significant within the

137 first 5 years (3-59 months) following the breast cancer diagnosis, but lost significance beyond 5

138 years after breast cancer diagnosis. The risk of subsequent meningioma found in our cohort was

139 the highest among other breast cancer and tumor behavior cohorts (See Supplementary Table

140 **S1). The trend of meningioma risk by year of diagnosis was stable over the course of the study**

141 (Figure 2), although in patients diagnosed late in the study (2014-2016) a short follow-up period

142 may have contributed to a wide CI of the SIR.

143 As shown in Table 3, there was a two-fold risk of meningioma among patients between

144 18-49 years of age (SIR 2.16; [1.78-2.61]; P<0.05), and an increased 24% risk in non-Hispanic

145 White (SIR 1.24 [1.16-1.32]; P<0.05). Patients with a divorced marital status (SIR 1.57 [1.33
146 1.84]; P<0.05), an uninsured status (SIR 2.47 [1.41-4.02]; P<0.05), and a more advanced tumor

147 stage (Stage IV, SIR 2.39 [1.71-3.25]; P<0.05) had an increased risk. A risk of subsequent

148 meningioma was found whether the breast cancer tumor had a positive or negative ER/PR status

149 and regardless of the treatment modality (radiotherapy or chemotherapy).

150 There were predictors related to demographic, socio-economic, and treatment features

151 that were associated with a higher likelihood of developing a meningioma among patients in the

152 cohort (Please see details in Supplementary Table S2).

153

154 _Trends in Diagnosis of Breast Cancer and Meningioma Cases_

155 The proportion of patients diagnosed with breast cancer over time remained comparable

156 in the study (7% vs 7%, 2004 vs 2016; P= 0.0390), while the proportion of patients diagnosed

157 with a meningioma significantly increased late in the study (1% vs 16%, 2004 vs 2016;

158 P<0.0001) (Supplemental Figure 1). When evaluating the trends in the diagnostic confirmation

159 of meningiomas (Supplemental Figure 2), there was an increase in the use of imaging alone

160 (50% vs 70%, 2004 vs 2016; P=0.0330) while macroscopic/microscopic visualization of the

161 tumor was less often used towards the end of the study (50% vs 30%, 2004 vs 2016; P=0.0287).

162 There was a difference in the diagnostic confirmation of meningiomas between age subgroups,

163 as a higher proportion of patients in the younger subgroup were diagnosed by

164 microscopic/macroscopic evaluation compared to elderly patients (40% vs 16%, 18-49 years vs

165 80+ years; P<0.0001). There were no differences in the diagnostic confirmation of meningiomas

166 between tumor staging subgroups.

167

168 **Discussion**

169 In this study of over 500,000 female patients with breast cancer, we identified nearly

170 1,200 patients that had a subsequent meningioma. In our cohort, there was a 26% increased risk

171 of developing a meningioma. Younger patients (18-49 years), those with a divorced marital

172 status, and patients with a more aggressive tumor stage had a higher risk than expected, while

173 treatment and hormone expression subgroups had an elevated yet comparable risk.

174 Prior studies have explored the association between breast cancer and meningioma using

175 state and national cancer registries. However, these studies were limited by the inability to adjust

176 the incidence rates of meningioma for age, race, and year of diagnosis when calculating the

177 expected number of cases for the SIR calculation.[4,6,17] Furthermore, the socio-demographic and

178 clinicopathological features associated with meningioma development in breast cancer patients

179 remained unexplored by these studies. Two previous studies have used the SEER database to

180 study the association between these two tumors – Lavrador et al.[18] evaluated the survival impact

6


-----

181 after the diagnosis of any of these two tumors and Milano et al.[17] described clinicopathologic

182 characteristics of breast cancer in women with meningioma.

183 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating patient characteristics

184 associated with a higher risk of meningioma development in breast cancer patients using the

185 SEER database, as in the study by Milano et al.[17] the SIR of meningioma was not calculated. The

186 number of patients in the BC-M group in our study is comparable to the one presented by

187 Lavrador et al., although we did not include patients with synchronous breast cancer and

188 meningioma, as mentioned above.

189 _Sociodemographic Factors_

190 A higher risk of meningioma was found in patients with a younger age (18-49 years, SIR

191 2.16) compared to the general population, with this trend decreasing with increasing age (Table

192 **3). The increased risk in this age group is noteworthy; meningiomas presenting in younger adults**

193 is relatively uncommon unless associated with a genetic syndrome, such as neurofibromatosis

194 type II.[1,14,19] In this age subgroup, the status of ER and PR was positive in 74% and 67% of

195 patients, respectively. The use of invasive methods for meningioma diagnosis in patients aged

196 18-49 years may have been influenced by the need to rule out other tumors due to the expected

197 lower incidence of breast cancer and meningioma in this age subgroup.

198 The observed risk in divorced and single patients may be explained by a prolonged

199 exposure to estrogen compared to those who were married, as these patients might have been less

200 likely to become pregnant, although data on fertility and use of oral contraceptive is needed to

201 support this assumption. Uninsured and insured patients presented a comparable higher risk of

202 meningioma development within the first 5 years after their initial diagnosis (Table 3), thus

203 decreasing our concern of surveillance bias in our cohort.

204 _Clinicopathological and Treatment Factors_

205 Patients diagnosed with a more aggressive tumor behavior had a higher risk of

206 meningioma than the general population. This finding was evident among patients with a tumor

207 staging IIA-IIIA/IV, with the highest risk in patients with a Stage IV tumor, although this lost

208 significance one year following breast cancer diagnosis. We considered the possibility of

209 misdiagnosis (e.g., dural-based breast metastasis diagnosed as meningioma), and found that all

210 patients with stage IV breast cancer diagnosed with a meningioma survived until the end of the

211 study period. Thus, the expected natural history of brain metastasis and the benign course of

7


-----

212 meningiomas may have guided the decision for diagnosis in this subgroup, shown by the

213 comparable use of imaging vs microscopic/macroscopic evaluation between the different tumor

214 staging subgroups.

215 Regarding the risk of meningioma development and the ER+/PR+ receptor status of

216 breast cancer patients, we found their risk to be similar (ER+: - SIR 1.26 vs ER-: SIR 1.31)

217 (PR+: SIR 1.27 vs PR-: SIR 1.30). The risk of meningioma after breast cancer regardless of

218 ER/PR expression suggests that the observed risk may be related to other factors beyond

219 hormone exposure or receptor status. This was previously suggested by the difference in the

220 incidence of meningioma between men and women with breast cancer despite the equal rate of

221 expression of the estrogen receptor.[6,20] Although not found in our study, other studies have

222 described the relationship between ER/PR expression in breast carcinoma and meningioma.[8,18,21 ]

223 The assumption of a treatment-related risk of developing meningioma was considered, as

224 previous studies have described that exposure to ionizing radiation (e.g., patients undergoing

225 radiotherapy) is a risk factor for meningioma.[1,14 ]In our study, the observed risk of meningioma

226 among patients treated with and without radiotherapy was comparable (SIR 1.26 vs SIR 1.25,

227 No/Unknown RT vs RT)(Table 3). When evaluating the cohort for potential predictors of

228 developing a meningioma (Supplementary Table S2), increasing age, divorced marital status,

229 and treatment with chemotherapy correlated with an increased likelihood of subsequent

230 meningioma, while a Hispanic race had a decreased likelihood. Treatment with radiotherapy was

231 not associated with meningioma development in the cohort.

232 _Limitations_

233 Our current work has several limitations, most of the which are inherent to its

234 retrospective design and the use of a national cancer registry. First, risk factors related to the

235 incidence of breast cancer (e.g., family history, smoking, number of pregnancies, exogenous

236 hormone use, etc.) are not recorded in the SEER database and thus we were unable to adjust for

237 these variables in our analysis. Second, the increased screening of cancer patients may have

238 resulted in surveillance bias, potentially related to the increasing proportion of meningioma cases

239 diagnosed over the study and the increased reliability of imaging for meningioma diagnosis (see

240 Supplementary Material). However, due to the benign and indolent natural history of

241 meningioma tumors, these may remain silent over years before leading to symptomatic disease,

242 and the true incidence of meningioma may still remain unaccounted for. Finally, most of the

8


-----

243 meningioma cases were diagnosed based on radiological findings without histologic

244 confirmation raising the concern for other possible diagnoses, although the natural history and

245 characteristic radiologic features of meningiomas may serve enough to differentiate from other

246 tumors.[22–24]

247 Despite these limitations, the study design, statistical analysis performed, and use of a

248 large population dataset allow to provide significant evidence on the increased risk of

249 meningioma in breast cancer patients and highlight the characteristics of breast cancer patients

250 associated with a higher risk. Future research should be directed towards evaluating the pathways

251 by which breast cancer tumors induce an increased risk of meningioma.

252

253 **Conclusions**

254 In this large population study, there was a higher risk of subsequent meningioma in

255 women with breast cancer compared to the general population, particularly in younger patients

256 and those with more aggressive disease. There was no association of subsequent meningioma

257 and radiotherapy treatment for breast cancer. A positive ER/PR status of the breast cancer tumor

258 did not confer additional risk of subsequent meningioma. These findings suggest that non
259 hormonal factors may play an important role in the association between these tumors. Awareness

260 of the higher than expected incidence of meningioma among breast cancer patients, especially

261 those at risk for metastatic disease and who later develop symptomatic or incidental brain

262 lesions, may serve useful in the clinical decision-making for this patient population.
