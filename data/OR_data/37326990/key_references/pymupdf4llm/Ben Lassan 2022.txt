**Abstract**
**Background There are limited data on whether primary diagnosis of meningioma may be associated with development of**
secondary primary cancer (SPC).
**Methods All meningioma cases (ICD-O-3 morphology codes 9530/0–9539/3) diagnosed in Jewish Israelis ≥ 20 years 1990**
through 2015 registered in the Israel National Cancer Registry (INCR) were retrieved. All subsequent cancers occurring
more than 6 months after meningioma diagnosis were identified. Risk of secondary cancer (SPC) was compared to cancer
risk in the general population through the calculation of standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks
(EARs). SIRs were stratified by type of second cancer, sex, and age group. Cox regression models were used to estimate
hazard ratios of developing SPC.
**Results Overall, 8044 meningioma cases were identified: mean age at diagnosis was 64.0 ± 14.1 years. Of these, 927 (11.5%)**
were diagnosed with SPC (SIR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5–1.7). SPC risk was elevated in men (SIR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5–1.9) and women
(SIR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5–1.8) diagnosed with meningioma in univariable analyses. Cancers most commonly encountered in
the studied population were breast (17.6%), colorectal (13.4%), lung (8.1%), prostate (5%), and bladder (4.6%) cancer. In
multivariable analyses, 10+ year increment in age at meningioma diagnosis was significantly associated with higher risk
for SPC in individuals diagnosed with meningioma between 20 and 64 years, with an inverse association in the older age
group (65+ years).
**Conclusions Meningioma diagnosis is associated with an increased risk for developing secondary cancers. This risk should**
be discussed with patients treated for meningioma.

Meningiomas are the most common benign tumors of the
central nervous system (CNS) with an age-adjusted incidence rate (per 100,000 person/years) of 8.36 and 3.61 for
females and males, respectively, and a population prevalence
rate of 97.5/100,000 in the United States [1]. Meningiomas
most commonly occur sporadically with no discernable family history, and are not associated with additional neoplasms
or inherited tumor predisposition syndromes, except for
over-representation of meningiomas in cases with Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) [2]. Exposure to ionizing radiation,
in particular therapeutic irradiation for childhood cancer [3],
and in atomic bomb survivors [4], is a well- established risk
factor for meningioma. Several studies have suggested radiotherapy and chemotherapy administered for the treatment
of pediatric cancer confer an increased risk of meningioma

[3, 5], with an estimated 1 in 8 childhood cancer survivors
developed late meningioma by age 40 years, correlated with
radiation dose and exposure age [3].
Studies that have focused on secondary primary cancers
(SPCs) diagnosed in patients initially diagnosed with meningioma have yielded inconsistent results. Some studies
reported no statistically significant risk for developing breast
cancer [6, 7] or any cancer type studied [8–10] regardless
of meningioma irradiation treatment [8, 9] and malignant
meningioma phenotype [8, 10]. Taken together, these studies indicate no increased risk for SPCs in persons diagnosed
with malignant meningioma compared with the risk of primary cancer in the general population.
In contrast to the above-referenced studies showing no
excess risk for secondary cancer after meningioma diagnosis, Davis et al. [11] evaluated the risk of SPCs after
meningioma diagnosis in Sweden between 1958 and1997.
Of 12,012 meningioma cases, 926 (7.7%) were diagnosed
with any SPC, with SIR = 1.2 (95% CI 1.1–1.3). Specifically, statistically significant SIRs were observed for renal
cancer (SIR = 1.6), melanoma (SIR = 1.7), thyroid cancer
(SIR = 2.6), and brain tumors (SIR = 2.6). The long-term
prognosis and quality of life of meningioma patients are
undoubtedly influenced by long-term morbidity that may
be associated with the treatment they received for their primary cancer, and more data are needed in this respect. In the
present study, data from the Israel National Cancer Registry
were used to calculate the risk of subsequent cancer diagnoses in individuals diagnosed with meningioma during the
period from 1990 to 2015.

### Methods

#### Patients

Cancer Registry-The Israel National Cancer Registry
(INCR), established in 1960, is a population-based, passive, national registry covering the population of the State
of Israel (approximately 9 million in 2020). The registry
records all incident cases of in situ and malignant neoplasms
(with the exception of squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas of the skin), and benign neoplasms of the brain and
central nervous system. Reporting to the registry has been
mandatory since 1982. The completeness of the INCR’s data
has been estimated at 97% for solid tumors and 87% for
hematopoietic tumors [12].
All cases registered in the INCR database meeting the
following criteria were identified: diagnosis of meningioma (ICD-O-3 morphology codes 9530/0–9539/3) during
the period from 1990 to2015; age 20 and over at the time
of the meningioma diagnosis; no history of malignant disease prior to the meningioma diagnosis; date of diagnosis

of meningioma not equal to the date of death; meningioma
diagnosis not based solely on a death certificate; Jewish
religion, as recorded in the National Population Registry.
Persons of other ethnicities were excluded from analysis as
they comprised only 10% of the population of meningioma
patients.
For all persons meeting the study inclusion criteria, we
searched the registry database for subsequent cancer diagnoses. Individuals diagnosed with a second primary cancer (SPC) less than 6 months after the index meningioma
diagnosis were excluded from the study cohort, in order to
avoid including primary cancers that may have been present,
but not clinically evident, at the time of the meningioma
diagnosis. Follow-up time was calculated as time from meningioma diagnosis to the first of the following events: (1)
SPC diagnosis, (2) death, (3) the end of the follow-up period
(31 December 2017). The study was approved by the Sheba
Medical Center ethics committee.

#### Statistical analyses

We conducted a descriptive analysis of the meningioma
cohort with attention to covariates likely to be associated
with the development of a second primary malignancy [age
at meningioma diagnosis, sex, tumor behavior of meningioma (invasive/noninvasive), and year of meningioma
diagnosis].
The outcome of interest was the diagnosis of any SPC
after a prior diagnosis of meningioma. Age at meningioma
diagnosis was grouped into two age groups: 20–64 years,
and 65+ years. The reason for this age-based subdivision
was an attempt to highlight the putative effects of genetic
predisposition to tumor development (presumably more
apparent in the younger age group). We calculated the rate of
SPC as the number of persons diagnosed with a subsequent
primary cancer divided by total person-years of follow-up.

#### Cumulative incidence of second primary cancers

The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of SPC in persons with meningioma during the period of follow-up, stratified by age at meningioma diagnosis and sex group. Gray’s test was used to test
the homogeneity of cumulative incidence functions (CIF)
between age and sex groups.

#### Calculation of standardized incidence ratios and excess absolute risks

We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for all
subsequent SPC and for the most frequently occurring
cancer types as the number of cases observed in the study
cohort during the follow-up period, divided by the number


-----

of cases that would be expected in the cohort on the basis of
age, sex, and population-group specific cancer rates for the
Israeli Jewish population [13]. We calculated excess absolute
risks as the difference between the number of observed and
expected events divided by the number of person-years in
follow-up and expressed per 100,000.

#### Risk factor analysis

We used multivariable Fine and Gray’s proportional subdistribution hazard models (PSH) to examine the risk of
developing SPC following meningioma diagnosis in each
of the age groups defined, adjusting for age at meningioma
diagnosis as a continuous variable, using increments of 5,
10, and 20 years, as well as adjusting for sex and year of
meningioma diagnosis, and considering death as a competing risk.
Hazard ratios were generated for SPC risk at 5, 10, and
15 years after meningioma diagnosis. Standard asymptotic
inference methods for COX regression that were based on
partial likelihood were used to construct 95% confidence
intervals and to carry out two-sided tests of statistical significance. All reported p values were two-sided and considered
statistically significant if < 0.05.

### Results

Overall, the study encompassed 8,044 meningioma cases

[140 (1.7%) malignant] who met the study inclusion criteria, with a total of 40,134 person-years in follow-up
(Fig. 1) (median follow-up 4.5 years, interquartile range 2.4
to 6.7 years). Of these cases, 2,308 (28.7%) were males,
and 5,736 (71.3%) females. Mean age at diagnosis was
64.1 years (Standard Deviation, SD = 13.5) and 63.8 years
(SD = 14.4), for males and females, respectively. Overall,
927 (rate of 15.7 per 1000 person-years) of participants were
diagnosed with SPCs during follow-up (Table 1). Almost
50% of SPC were diagnosed 1 to 5 years following meningioma diagnosis, and an additional 25% were diagnosed 5
to 10 years following that diagnosis.

#### Standardized incidence ratio and excess absolute risk analysis

The five most common SPC in males were prostate (16.8%),
colorectal cancer (15.0%), lung cancer (11.3%), bladder
cancer (10.0%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (6.3%). In
females, breast cancer (25.0%), colorectal cancer (12.7%),

lung cancer (6.9%), thyroid cancer (4.3%) and cancer of the
uterus (4.2%) were the most commonly encountered SPCs.
Both men and women with a meningioma diagnosis had
an elevated risk of developing a SPC compared with the
general population (SIR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5–1.9 and 1.6, 95%
CI 1.5–1.8, respectively) (Table 2). In males, the SIR was
statistically significant for most cancer types with the notable exception of pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, malignant
melanoma, stomach cancer and thyroid cancer (Table 2). In
females, the risks of SPC for all cancer types analyzed were
statistically significant with the exception of bladder and
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Table 2).

#### Cumulative incidence rates

We analyzed the cumulative incidence rates for developing SPC. We compared the cumulative incidence function
(CIF) between age groups by using Gray’s test, as presented
in Fig. 2. We found that the cumulative incidence rate for
SPC at 20 years after first meningioma diagnosis was higher
among persons who were older at the time of meningioma
diagnosis: 9.9% (95% CI 8.79–11.27%) among 20–64 year
olds and 23.76% (95% CI 22–29.4%) among those 65 and
older age. We found no association between sex and cumulative risk of SPC (p = 0.7207).

#### Risk factor analysis

We used multivariable Fine and Gray’s proportional subdistribution hazard models (PSH) to examine the risk of
developing SPC following meningioma diagnosis. The
proportional hazard assumption for age effect was violated,
since the effect of age varies over time; therefore, the final
Cox regression model was fitted accordingly: analysis by
age groups (20–64 years and 65+ years), adjusting for age at

## 1 3


meningioma diagnosis as a continuous variable (using increments of 5, 10 and 20 years), sex, and year of meningioma
diagnosis categorized into two time periods (1990–2009
and 2010–2015) and considering death as a competing risk.
Interaction between age and time of diagnosis was significant; however, this was not included in the final model due
to its negligible effect. This model showed significant independent association of age with risk of developing SPC.
Individuals diagnosed with meningioma in the younger age
group (20–64 years), increments of 10 and 20 years in age
at diagnosis were significantly associated with higher risk
for SPC: HR 1.66 (95% CI 1.02–2.72) and HR 4.25 (95% CI
2.38–7.60), respectively. In persons diagnosed with meningioma in the older age group (65+ years), increments of 5, 10,
and 20 years in age at diagnosis were significantly associated with lower risk for SPC: HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.53–0.97),
HR 0.71 (0.52–0.96) and HR 0.69 (95% CI 0.49–0.97),
respectively (Table 3).

### Discussion

The current study shows that a history of meningioma, in
most cases a benign tumor, increases the risk for developing
a host of secondary cancers, more often in individuals older
than 65 years of age at the time of meningioma diagnosis.
However, while in individuals diagnosed with meningioma
between 20 and 64 years of age a more advanced age at
meningioma diagnosis is a significant risk factor for SPC,
this association is inverse in the older age group (65+ at
meningioma diagnosis). Diagnosis of more than one tumor
type in a single individual is one of the hallmarks of cancer
susceptibility [14]. Yet, cancer susceptibility syndromes that
encompass meningioma risk are rare, and primarily include
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) [15]. While it is still possible that a subset of cases analyzed herein are indeed unrecognized NF2 cases, the spectrum of malignant tumors that
are encountered in these unselected meningioma cases far
exceeds those associated with NF2 (acoustic neuroma, for
the most part). Moreover, given the estimated rates of NF2
(1–9/100,000) [16] it is unlikely that NF2-enriched cases
underlie the observed increased cancer rates.
While there is ample evidence regarding the association
between therapeutic irradiation for a malignant tumor and
the subsequent development of meningioma [17], there are
few reports of a meningioma association with subsequent
cancer. Helseth et al. [6] reviewed the association between
meningioma and breast cancer in Norway from 1955 to
1986, and reported that the relative risk (RR) for developing breast cancer in women aged 50–64 years who were
initially diagnosed with meningioma and followed up for
3,932 person/years was significantly elevated (RR 1.92 CI
1.02–3.29). Risk for renal cancer in men was also elevated

(RR 4.76 p = 0.05). Claus et al. [18] reported that meningioma patients (n = 1,124) were more likely than the controls
(n = 1,000) to have a family history of meningioma in a firstdegree relative (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.6–11.5), personal history
of thyroid cancer (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.02–21.5), or leukemia


(OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.2–24.1) (most after radiotherapy). These
are all indirect lines of evidence that support the notion of
a common genetic predisposition to meningioma and SPC.
A common clinical practice in Israel in the 1950’s to the
early 1960’s was to use low dose irradiation to treat Tinea

Capitis, especially in new immigrants from North Africa

[19]. A subset of these irradiated individuals developed
benign (and malignant) brain tumors. In the most comprehensive long-term follow-up (40-year-median followup) 67/10,834 irradiated individuals were diagnosed with

## 1 3


meningiomas [20]. Thus, it seems that even if a small subset of the current cohort did undergo low dose irradiation
for Tinea capitis, the overall effects on the results would be
minimal.
One possible mechanism that may be considered to
account for the meningioma-SPC association may be a yet
unknown cancer susceptibility gene that confers higher susceptibility to SPC in a subset of meningioma cases. Supportive evidence for this possibility was reported by Hemminki
et al. [21] who assessed the risk for first degree relatives
of individuals with meningioma to develop the same tumor
type. In that study, the standardized incidence ratios (SIRs)
for familial risk were increased: when either of the parents
was diagnosed with meningioma, the SIR for offspring was
3.06, and for an affected sibling, the SIR was 4.41. These
increased familial risks may indicate a common genetic factor or a shared environmental exposure. Barchana and Liphshitz [22] reported that based on a limited number of benign
meningioma cases (n = 412) Iranian Jews living in Israel
have higher rates of meningioma compared with rates in
other Jewish communities originating in Balkan states: 1.46fold compared with Turkish Jews and 1.86-fold compared
with Jews of Bulgarian, Greek origin. To further explore
the possibility of genetic susceptibility, subsequent studies


-----

should focus on families displaying this meningioma—
SPC phenotype and combine whole exome/ whole-genome
sequencing technologies to identify the putative gene(s). In
addition, the surveillance scheme that meningioma cases
are offered after diagnosis may account for higher rates of
SPC diagnosis. Thus, cancers may have been incidentally
diagnosed in meningioma cases who remain under medical
surveillance after meningioma diagnosis. This possibility
needs to be further explored, if the results of the current
study are validated. Moreover, assessment of the impact of
such a seemingly early stage cancer on survival can only be
prospectively assessed.
Age-adjusted risk analysis showed that in individuals
diagnosed with meningioma under 64 years of age the risk
for SPC increased in those older at meningioma diagnosis
whereas in those diagnosed with meningioma above that
age, the association between age at meningioma diagnosis
and SPC risk was inverse. Several factors could account for
that difference. The small number of individuals diagnosed
at the older age group, a survival bias for those who did get
to age 65 and above, and the relatively shorter life span of
the older vs. the younger age group.
The results of this preliminary study should be validated
in larger, ethnically diverse, prospective studies. If validated,
there may be clinical implications to the observed higher
SPC risk. These increased risks, once quantified, should be
discussed with meningioma cases by the treating physician
and surveillance schemes should be evaluated to facilitate
early detection of specific cancer types, whenever possible
and cost effective.
The limitations of the current study should be considered.
This is a single country experience and cancer susceptibility
may be distinct in other ethnically diverse, genetically heterogeneous populations. The possibility of a selection bias
should also be considered, as reporting of non-malignant
cases may be non-complete and one of the caveats. Furthermore, meningioma diagnosis may either lead to increased
medical surveillance, or mark a subgroup of individuals
who are using the medical system more regularly and thus
have their tumors detected sooner. Additionally, our inability to adjust for potential confounders, especially variables
that are associated with both meningioma incidence and
other cancers occurrence such as smoking and obesity, may
have caused information bias. Specifically, given the fact
that smoking status is missing from the majority of cases
reported herein, and the known effect that smoking has on
multiple cancer types, this is a major limitation.
In conclusion, a history of meningioma is associated with
an increased risk for developing a variety of cancer types,
especially in individuals aged 65 years of age and over at
meningioma diagnosis. These results, if validated in subsequent studies, may have clinical implication and may offer
early detection schemes tailored to these individuals.
