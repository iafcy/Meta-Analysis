**BACKGROUND. Published case reports of a possible association between meningi-**
oma and breast carcinoma are not uncommon in the literature. Four published
analytic studies have addressed this suggested association specifically. Three of

these studies reported significant associations, with relative risk estimates mostly
between 1.5 and 2.0. The other study reported relative risk point estimates near 1.5,
but confidence intervals included 1.0. The current study was a population-based,
retrospective cohort analysis that evaluated the risk of subsequent breast carcinoma in women who were diagnosed with meningioma and the risk of subsequent
meningioma in women who were diagnosed with breast carcinoma.
**METHODS. The measure of association is the relative risk and is reported as the**
standardized incidence ratio (SIR). Using western Washington State cancer registry
data and intercensal population estimates for western Washington State, incidence
rates of second primary tumor were compared between identified meningioma
and breast carcinoma cohorts and the general population for the years 1992–1998.
**RESULTS. The risk of breast carcinoma after patients were diagnosed with menin-**
gioma (SIR) was 1.54 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.77–2.75). The risk of
meningioma after patients were diagnosed with breast carcinoma was 1.40 (95% CI,
0.67–2.58), and the risk of meningioma after patients were diagnosed with invasive
breast carcinoma was 1.64 (95% CI, 0.79–3.02). In each combination for age groups
ages � 50 years, risks were elevated, but the confidence intervals included 1.0.
**CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that the risk of meningioma among women**
who have experienced breast carcinoma and the risk of breast carcinoma among
women who have experienced meningioma are elevated moderately. Shared risk
factors may account for the relatively week bidirectional associations seen in this
and other studies. Cancer 2002;94:1626–35. © 2002 American Cancer Society.

ublished case reports as early as 1929 suggested a possible association between meningioma and breast carcinoma. In the inter# P
vening years, several clinical reports of patients who developed both
meningioma and breast carcinoma have been published. Since 1980,
at least 12 case reports have been published in English language
journals in which 56 individuals with diagnoses of both breast carcinoma and meningioma were described.[1–11] Before 1980, 17 additional
patients were reported in English language journals.[12] The clinical
literature suggests several possible mechanisms to explain the clinical
reports. One article posited an association based merely on collision
tumors in which a malignant tumor (breast carcinoma) metastasizes
to a preexisting benign tumor (meningioma).[12] Reports of breast
carcinoma and meningioma in situations where the presence of


-----

pathologically confirmed collision tumors could not
be demonstrated prompted explanations suggesting
that meningioma may result as a direct metastasis of
breast carcinoma. Several case reports described meningioma as a pathologically confirmed, metastatic
product of breast carcinoma.[1–3] However, at least one
case report suggested the opposite relation, with meningioma preceding and serving as the source for
breast malignancy.[4]

The clinical literature also has suggested that the
association may not be based on metastatic events
but, rather, on common risk factors.[5] This line of reasoning follows from several pieces of evidence. First,
both breast carcinoma and meningioma occur much
more frequently in women than in men. Second, both
tumors occur more frequently as age increases. In
addition, increased tumor growth has been observed
during pregnancy for both meningioma and breast
carcinoma, suggesting hormone-induced stimulation.[13] Recent efforts to determine shared genetic predisposition for these two types of neoplasms have
provided more information but have neither dismissed nor supported the reported link between the
two tumors. In particular, although the BRCA1 and
_BRCA2 genes have been linked to familial and spo-_
radic forms of breast carcinoma, an analysis of BRCA1
and BRCA2 genes in patients with sporadic meningiomas has suggested that alterations of the BRCA1 and
_BRCA2 genes are not common pathogenetic events in_
the development of meningioma.[13]

It is possible that an association between breast
carcinoma and meningioma may be due to an overlap
in the gene-environment interactions necessary for
tumorigenesis. For both tumors, recent research has
focused on loss of heterozygosity (LOH), or the loss of
one allele in a tumor cell from a chromosome region
for which individual normal cells are heterozygous: It
is believed that LOH promotes tumorigenesis through
a process whereby the expression of the disease occurs
with the loss of the normal (or protective) allele
through possible pathways, such as gene-environment interactions or by environmental causes alone.[14]

Two chromosomal regions, 1p13–p21 and 22q11–
q13, frequently exhibit LOH in breast carcinoma, meningioma, and other types of tumor.[15,16] At least three
tumor suppressor inactivation genes have been identified on the long arm of chromosome 22.[15] Observed
associations between breast carcinoma and meningioma may be due to the activation (or inactivation) of
genes in these regions. However, the tumorigenesis
pathways may diverge for breast carcinoma and meningioma, because other unrelated chromosomal regions have been proposed as critical events. For example, it is hypothesized that the 14q24 to 14q32


**Breast Carcinoma and Meningioma/Custer et al.** **1627**

region is the critical region responsible for immortalizing cells, resulting in the most aggressive forms of
meningioma, yet this region has not been implicated
in the development of breast carcinoma.[15]

Current genetic investigations and clinical reports
appear to assume that an association between breast
carcinoma and meningioma already has been established. However, the literature includes only six studies that have sought to quantify the association between primary malignancies and meningiomas.[17–22]

Specific consideration of the association between
breast carcinoma and meningioma has been reported
in four studies (Table 1): Three of these studies found
a significant association between the two tumors.[17,18,22] The other study did not find a statistically
significant association.[21]

The objective of the current study was to quantify
the association between breast carcinoma and meningioma in women by using population-based data. The
hypotheses tested were 1) that a diagnosis of breast
carcinoma places a woman at increased risk for a
subsequent diagnosis of primary meningioma and 2)
that a diagnosis of meningioma places a woman at
increased risk for a subsequent diagnosis of primary
breast carcinoma.

### MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was a population-based, retrospective cohort analysis. The study population included all the
female residents age � 15 years who resided in the 13
counties of western Washington State, where the Cancer Surveillance System (CSS) at the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) collects data on malignant neoplasms and on some nonmalignant neoplasms. The study period was 1992–1998. During the
study period, the average total population of age-eligible women in the 13-county area was nearly
1,473,000 women.[23]

Since 1974, CSS has collected data on the incidence, treatment, and outcomes for all patients with
newly diagnosed breast carcinoma. Since 1991, CSS
has collected the same data for patients with primary
meningioma. CSS data-collection staff members abstract data on � 95% of patients with neoplasms, with
the remaining data abstracted by hospital tumor registry personnel. Diagnosis and treatment data are obtained from individual medical and hospital records.
CSS staff members as well as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program representatives carry
out all case-finding and quality-control procedures.[24]

The tumor registry collects confidential information
and assigns a unique number to each individual that
includes a sequence code to identify additional neoplasm diagnoses in the same individual. Follow-up

information is collected annually using data from a
variety of sources, such as hospital records, the Washington State Department of Motor Vehicles, the Health
Care Financing Administration, Washington State
death records, voter registration, Social Security information, and the National Death Index. To protect
patient privacy, CSS did not provide the day of diagnosis. Therefore, it was necessary to assume that all
diagnoses occurred on the 15th day of each diagnosis
month. Exact birth dates (day, month, and year) were
provided.
This study posed minimal risk to study participants, because the cancer registry did not provide data
that would permit identification of individuals; therefore, informed consent was not required by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). After FHCRC IRB approval of the study design, two data sets were
provided. One contained information for all primary
breast carcinoma diagnoses recorded by the registry
since 1974. The other data set contained all primary
meningioma diagnoses recorded by the registry. The
meningioma data included incidental coding of meningioma diagnoses before 1991. If a person was diagnosed with another primary malignancy and then
developed meningioma, then reports of the meningioma diagnosis may have been submitted to CSS. Diagnoses before 1991 are recorded in the CSS data but
do not reflect complete surveillance for meningioma
and, thus, were not used here. Each data set was
reduced to primary diagnoses of the respective disease
between 1992 and 1998. Although ascertainment of


meningioma occurred starting in 1991, we decided in
advance to exclude 1991 data to ensure the most complete ascertainment of each disease for every year of
the study. Each of these data sets alone was used to
determine the number of all primary breast carcinomas and primary invasive breast carcinomas or primary meningiomas, respectively. Using this method,
two cohorts were defined. The meningioma cohort
consisted of 598 women who were diagnosed with any
type of primary central nervous system (CNS) meningioma. Similarly, a breast carcinoma cohort was
formed that consisted of 21,551 women who were
diagnosed with any type of primary breast carcinoma.
Because of the possibility that more aggressive breast
tumors may be more likely to result in a subsequent
diagnosis of meningioma, a subcohort consisting of
18,349 women who had been diagnosed with primary
invasive breast carcinoma also was identified.
To determine the number of women who had
diagnoses of both diseases, the original two data sets
were linked using the unique cancer registry number
from which the neoplasm sequence number had been
removed. In linking the data sets, no restrictions on
year of diagnosis were employed, and it was determined that 35 women who were recorded in the registry had diagnoses of both diseases. Subsequently,
the data set was restricted to include only those
women for whom the diagnoses of both primary
breast carcinoma and meningioma occurred within
the study period. Among the women in each of the two
cohorts, 24 women had diagnoses of both primary


-----

CNS meningioma and primary breast carcinoma during 1992–1998. A total of three women with concurrent
diagnoses (defined as diagnoses of both meningioma
and breast carcinoma within the same 30 day period)
were excluded, because these women would have
contributed to the counts for each disease but would
not have contributed any length of time at risk (person-years) to the denominator of each incidence rate,
arbitrarily increasing the relative risk estimates. No
diagnosis of either disease occurred at autopsy.
For women in the meningioma cohort, the length
of time at risk (person-years) for breast carcinoma
diagnosis was measured as the time from meningioma
diagnosis to one of four possible end points: diagnosis
of breast carcinoma, death, lost to CSS follow-up, or
the end of the study (December, 1998). Similar methods were used to determine person-years at risk for
women in the breast carcinoma cohort and in the
invasive breast carcinoma subcohort.
To determine the expected number of patients
with the relevant second tumor, we calculated population rates of primary meningioma, primary breast
carcinoma, and primary invasive breast carcinoma in
western Washington State women using CSS data for
1992–1998 and using intercensal population estimates
provided by the Washington State Department of
Health as the population person-years at risk.[23] The
summation of the annual intercensal population estimates from 1992 through 1998 represents the total
accumulated person-years at risk. Washington State
intercensal population estimates are reported as
5-year age groups, so we were able to determine corresponding age group specific incidence rates of all
diagnoses.
All data cleaning and analyses were performed
using Stata statistical software (release 6.0; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX). The measure of association was the relative risk and is reported as the standardized incidence ratio (SIR). We compared the
observed number of breast carcinomas in the group of
women who had first been diagnosed with meningioma to the expected numbers of breast carcinomas
among women with a diagnosis of meningioma. The
expected number of breast carcinomas in the meningioma cohort was determined by multiplying 5-year
age and calendar year strata of person-years at risk by
the corresponding 5-year age group specific incidence
rates of breast carcinoma in the female population.
SIRs were calculated as the ratio of observed to expected numbers of breast carcinomas using intercensal population estimates of women age � 15 years
living in the 13 county area of Washington State as the
standard population. Exact 95% confidence intervals
(95%CI) were calculated with the assumption of a


**Breast Carcinoma and Meningioma/Custer et al.** **1629**

Poisson distribution for the data.[25] We calculated SIRs
for meningioma in the breast carcinoma cohort and
the invasive breast carcinoma subcohort using the
same method.

### RESULTS
The age distributions for meningioma and for both
breast carcinoma diagnoses in the study population
were consistent with the currently accepted, descriptive epidemiology of both diseases (Table 2). The
greatest number of diagnoses for each disease occurred in women age 50–80 years, even though they
make up a relatively small percentage of the general
population of adult women. The occurrence of both
diseases in the same individual was most common for
women age � 65 years. Due to the race distribution in
western Washington State, it was only possible to examine associations between meningioma and breast
carcinoma for white women.
In the study, a total of 24 women were identified
with diagnoses of both meningioma and breast carcinoma during the years 1992–1998. For 10 of these
women, the diagnosis of breast carcinoma occurred
first; for 11 women, the diagnosis of meningioma occurred first; and, for 3 women, we classified the diagnoses as concurrent (Table 3). For nonconcurrent diagnoses, regardless of which diagnosis occurred first,
� 70% of the women had the subsequent diagnosis at
least 7 months after the first diagnosis. Among women
who were diagnosed with meningioma first, the
elapsed time until they were diagnosed with breast
carcinoma appeared to peak after approximately 2
years. For women who were diagnosed first with primary breast carcinoma, followed by meningioma, the
elapsed time between diagnoses was distributed
evenly over the 7-year follow-up.
The greatest incidence of meningioma or breast
carcinoma occurred in women between the ages of 50
years and 80 years (Table 4). This relation was most
evident for women in the breast carcinoma cohort and
the invasive breast carcinoma subcohort, in whom the
incidence rates were greatest between the ages of 50
years and 79 years. The peak incidence rate for meningioma or breast carcinoma in the study population
occurred in women age 65–79 years.
The observed number of breast carcinoma diagnoses in the meningioma cohort was 11.0, whereas the
expected number of breast carcinoma diagnoses was
7.16. These values resulted in an SIR of 1.54 (95%CI,
0.77–2.75) for the diagnosis of breast carcinoma in
adult women after a previous diagnosis of meningioma (Table 5). The risk was greatest among women
age 50–64 years; however, the confidence intervals for
all age specific risk estimates included 1.0.

b General population percentage were based on Washington State intercensal estimates 1992–1998 (those age � 15 years account for 21.5% of the total population).


The overall estimate of the risk of a diagnosis of
meningioma in women with a previous diagnosis of
any breast carcinoma was 1.40 (95% CI, 0.67–2.58)
(Table 6). Except for women age � 34 years, the point
estimates for the age group specific risk of meningioma indicated elevated risk, although the confidence
intervals were quite large and indicated that the results were not statistically significant. Even though the
observed and expected numbers of meningioma diagnoses were small for each age group, there was a
suggestion of increasing risk in older age groups.
When the analysis was restricted to women with invasive breast carcinoma, the risk of a subsequent diagnosis of meningioma increased from 1.40 to 1.64 (95%
CI, 0.79–3.02) (Table 7). Moreover, each age group
specific estimate for women age � 34 years increased,
and the increased risk at older ages was maintained.
Once again, although all age specific point estimates
were elevated, the confidence intervals included 1.0.

### DISCUSSION
The CSS registry in Washington State is unique, in
that, since 1991, data on the population incidence of
the usually benign tumor, meningioma, have been


collected. Therefore, western Washington State CSS
data allowed for a population-based investigation of
whether women who develop either primary meningioma or primary breast carcinoma have an increased
risk of developing the other disease. Case reports of
separate tumors occurring in combination are frequent, and it is difficult to know whether these occurrences are random events or represent an association
between the tumors.[27] In this study, the overall relative risk point estimates ranged from 1.40 to 1.64.
However, our results did not indicate statistically significant associations between the risk of meningioma
in women who were diagnosed previously with breast
carcinoma or the risk of breast carcinoma in women
who were diagnosed previously with meningioma.
Data collection for this study occurred at a time
when the use of advanced imaging techniques (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging)
was increasingly common. The use of these imaging
techniques has the potential to introduce bias, because asymptomatic tumors are more likely to be diagnosed, especially in persons with previously diagnosed disease. Information bias that results when
women who have been diagnosed with one disease are

followed more closely cannot be ruled out. In addition, if medical monitoring is more intensive when a
person is diagnosed with either breast carcinoma or
meningioma, then it is expected that otherwise
asymptomatic conditions would be diagnosed more
frequently proximate to the first diagnosis. A peak in
second primary neoplasm diagnosis within the year
after the first diagnosis did not occur for either breast
carcinoma or meningioma.
The total period for the study was 84 months, and
the diagnosis of subsequent meningioma or breast
carcinoma after this time could not be assessed. Meningiomas are very slow-growing tumors.[28] This study
period may have been insufficient to determine with


accuracy a possible association between breast carcinoma and meningioma occurring many years later.
Consistently, we detected an association between
breast carcinoma and meningioma, but the study was
limited by the number of women who experienced
both tumors The combination of small numbers of
women with both tumors and the potentially too short
follow-up may explain the large confidence intervals.
This study also was limited in the analysis of specific directions of disease (meningioma followed by
breast carcinoma and breast carcinoma followed by
meningioma). The diagnosis of each disease was used
as the proxy measure of occurrence of the disease.
With the available data, there was no way to determine

whether the presence of meningioma was occult and,
thus, whether the occurrence of meningioma actually
preceded the occurrence of breast carcinoma in the
two breast carcinoma cohorts.
Another limitation of the current study was the
inability to account for women who no longer resided
in western Washington State. The person-years at risk


calculations were dependent on good ascertainment
of vital status after a diagnosis of either condition. To
determine whether migration out of the CSS data collection area may have resulted in underestimates of
the person-years at risk, we examined U.S. Census
Bureau migration patterns for Washington State. The
most recently available migration pattern data cover


-----

the time period between 1985 and 1990.[29] Among
persons age � 5 years, 74% resided in the same county
of Washington State, and 84% continued to reside in
Washington State. These statistics include persons of
all ages � 5 years; data restricted to adult populations
were not available. It seems reasonable to assume that
migration patterns are related to age and that children
and young families constitute the greatest percentage
of persons who change residence. For these reasons, it
does not appear that migration out of western Washington State, especially for older women, was an important influence in our study.
Annual vital status information was collected for
68% of the women in the meningioma cohort. The
reported mortality rate at follow-up was 23%. The
mortality cause was not available from the CSS data
unless it was from a neoplastic disease for which the
registry collects data. It is assumed that the majority of
observed mortality occurred as a result of age. Annual
vital status information was collected for 94% of the
women in the breast carcinoma cohort. The reported
mortality rate at follow-up was 20%. We assumed that
all women contributed fully to the person-time during
follow-up unless they were deceased. Succinctly, the
follow-up end point of mortality was well ascertained,
but loss to follow-up due to migration would have
resulted in an overestimate of the true person-time
under surveillance for the second tumor; hence, the
SIRs would be underestimated. However, because the
results suggested moderately elevated risks, loss to
follow-up did not appear to be a driver of the analytic
results.
By defining the study period as 1992–1998, we
intended to assess accurately the accumulated person-time at risk. The exclusion of diagnoses that occurred outside the study period was necessary to prevent bias caused by the accumulation of time at risk
only for those women who had been diagnosed with
one of the diseases and not for all of the women who
had been diagnosed with both breast carcinoma and
meningioma. This restriction resulted in a reduction
in the number of women with diagnoses of both diseases from 35 women to 24 women. These small numbers of women had a prominent influence on this
analysis. Although the point estimates suggest an association, the 95%CIs represent a large range of possible results. A future analysis using additional data
from other cancer registries or the same data, but over
a larger study period, would be helpful in improving
confidence in the risk estimates.
The current study adds further evidence to the
suggestion that, if the two tumors are related, then it is
probably only because they share common risk factors. None of the risk estimates reported here is suffi

ciently different to indicate a specific pathway of association. For example, if meningioma is a risk factor
for the development of breast carcinoma, but not the
reverse, then one would expect that the relative risk of
breast carcinoma in the meningioma cohort would be
notably larger than the risk of meningioma in the
breast carcinoma cohorts.
The shared risk factors hypothesis suggests that
the tumors are not associated causally. Rather, any
association between the two tumors rests on nonspecific mechanisms, such as age, gender, hormone induction, and possibly other demographic characteristics that are common to both tumors. The results from
studies by Helseth et al. and Jacobs et al. suggested a
nonspecific mechanism of association.[17,21] Jacobs et
al. did not find evidence for a statistically significant
association for the risk of breast carcinoma in women
who were diagnosed with meningioma (standardized
mortality ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.74–2.50). The estimate
presented here was similar (SIR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.77–
2.75). Helseth et al. reported a significant association
between breast carcinoma and meningioma when
breast carcinoma was diagnosed first (SIR, 1.75; 95%
CI, 1.08–2.68). The association when meningioma was
diagnosed first was nearly significant (SIR, 1.54; 95%
CI, 0.97–2.34). However, none of the age group specific
relative risks reported by Helseth et al. were significant
except for women age 50–64 years who were diagnosed with meningioma first. Because all of the risk
estimates reported by Helseth et al. represent approximately the same level of association regardless of
which disease was diagnosed first, that study tends to
support an association on the basis of shared risk
factors.
In the study by Helseth et al., 9 of 12 meningiomas
were incidental findings at autopsy.[17] Those tumors
did not represent medically evident conditions that
lead to diagnosis or treatment, and it is possible that
the inclusion of such diagnoses at autopsy produced
the statistically significant relative risks. In contrast, all
of the meningioma diagnoses in the current study
were me from living women who contributed to the
person-years at risk in the appropriate cohort even if
they were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.
Emry found a large increased risk of meningioma
in women who were diagnosed previously with breast
carcinoma (observed/expected ratio, 3.5; P � 0.001),
whereas the risk of breast carcinoma in women who
were diagnosed with meningioma was not significant
(observed to expected tumor ratio, 1.1; P � 0.05).[22]

The Emry study relied on Los Angeles County Cancer
Surveillance Program (CSP) data: At the time of that
study, CSP data only included incidence of meningioma and/or breast carcinoma. Follow-up data were


-----

not available, and it was necessary to model the person-years at risk using SEER cancer rates for the U.S.
population and estimates of mortality. In our study,
follow-up data, including mortality, were available for
all individuals who continued to reside in Washington
State, and the population rates for all diseases were
determined using the registry data and the intercensal
population estimates from which the diagnoses arose.
The statistical association between breast carcinoma and meningioma was reported first by Schoenberg et al., who published an observed to expected
estimate of 1.76 (P � 0.05).[18] In that study, only the
association between the two diseases was examined,
that is, the diagnosis of either breast carcinoma or
meningioma followed by the diagnosis of the other
disease was included in the same risk calculation. In
addition, the estimate was based on a small number of
observed tumors (8) and expected tumors (3.4), and
the results represent one of the few significant associations from several comparisons of many different
tumor combinations.
The published case reports of meningioma and
breast carcinoma in the same individual suggest that
the pathologic classification of the first tumor may
influence the risk of the occurrence of the second
tumor. This reasoning seems logical, in that a more
aggressive tumor may be more likely to metastasize.
Specifically, the CNS is a common metastatic site for
breast tumors.[22] Pathologic confirmation of tumor
type is collected in the CSS registry. Of the 24 women
for whom the diagnoses of breast carcinoma and meningioma occurred during the study period, 22 meningiomas were classified as benign (the tumor type was
missing for 2 diagnoses). For the breast carcinoma
diagnoses, 4 women had in situ tumors, 18 women
had malignant tumors, and 1 woman had a metastatic
tumor. These breast carcinoma tumor types in the
women with both diagnoses followed the same general distribution that was seen in the entire 21,551member breast carcinoma cohort. Because more aggressive tumors are no more common in women with
diagnoses of both tumors than in women with only
breast carcinoma or meningioma, the data suggest
that tumor type probably is not related to the likelihood of developing of a second primary neoplasm for
these two diseases.
To assess whether the suggested risk factor for
meningioma, radiation treatment, influences the likelihood of the occurrence of both diseases, we examined the treatment information contained in the CSS
data base, including the type of surgery and various
treatment modalities for women with a diagnosis of
breast carcinoma. Treatment information for women
with a diagnosis of meningioma is not collected ac

tively but is coded when available. When either breast
carcinoma or meningioma is diagnosed first, the treatment codes do not suggest that radiation treatment is
a clear factor in subsequent risk of development of the
other tumor. Of the 10 women who had a subsequent
diagnosis of meningioma after a diagnosis of breast
carcinoma, only 4 women were treated with beam
radiation during breast carcinoma treatment, whereas
6 women had no radiation treatment of any kind. This
prevalence of beam radiation treatment in women
who had both tumors is not significantly different than
for women in the entire breast carcinoma cohort. Of
the 11 women who had a subsequent diagnosis of
breast carcinoma after a diagnosis of meningioma, 2
women were treated with beam radiation, 6 women
had no radiation treatment of any kind, and 3 women
had missing information. This pattern of beam radiation, no radiation, and missing data for women diagnosed with meningioma and subsequent breast carcinoma is not significantly different than for the entire
meningioma cohort. The treatment code information
does not suggest that radiation treatment is related to
the subsequent risk of developing these second primary neoplasms.
The persistence of case reports on the suggested
association and genetic investigation of the common
tumorigenesis pathways continue. Several case reports have been published in the 1990s, with the most
recent published in 1998.[3,5,8,9,11] These case reports
imply that a significant association is present, whereas
analytic studies have provided, at best, equivocal confirmation of the association. Even though it was limited by its small sample size, the current study suggests that any such association is probably modest.
Further analysis using larger sets of population-based
data that include longer follow-up may be necessary
to fully detect this association. Shared risk factors may
account for the relatively week bidirectional associations seen in this study and in other studies.
