SUMMARY

_We report 12 new cases of female breast cancer associated with intracranial meningiomas,_
_inclusive of autopsy study. At the time of death the patients' age ranged from 52 to 95 years_
_(average 70.6 years). Breast carcinomas were documented ante mortem in 11_ _cases and at_
_autopsy in_ 1. Meningiomas were diagnosed at autopsy (10 cases) _or in vivo (2_ _cases). The_
_diagnosis_ _of meningioma antedated that_ _of mammary carcinoma in only one patient._
_Histologically, the cancers were of ductal (11_ _cases)_ _and lobular infiltrating (1_ _case)_ _types_
_and showed a variable malignancy grade. Widespread extracranial metastases were_
_present at autopsy in_ 7 cases. Brain metastases were seen in 1 case. _Neurologic signs were_
_referred in 4 subjects. Four breast cancers and one meningioma showed immunoreactivity_
_for progesterone receptors, whereas all the cases were negative for estrogen receptors._
_In one case, metastatic breast carcinoma tissue was present within a psammomatous_
_meningioma._
_A brief review_ _of the literature, which includes_ 14 similar observations, _is_ _reported._
_Although the association of breast cancer and meningioma is_ _still difficult to explain, its_
_clinical implications are important and deserve proper attention. A proper work up_ _in_
_patients with suspected intracranial metastases_ _is_ _recommended_ so _that resectable_
_meningiomas are_ _not mistaken for metastases._
