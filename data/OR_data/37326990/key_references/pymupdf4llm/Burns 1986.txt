## Association of Breast Cancer With Meningioma

#### A Report of Five Cases

PATRICIA E. BURNS, MB, **CHB,** DMRT,* NARESH JHA, MB, BS,t AND GORDON 0. BAIN, MD, FRCP(C)*

**Five patients with diagnosed breast cancer who developed meningiomas are reported. The literature contains**
**reports of an additional 25 such patients. Some authors have noted hormonal sensitivity and the presence**
**of hormone receptors in some meningiomas. Because breast cancer is** **a common tumor of** **women, it is**
**probable that any association between breast cancer and meningioma is fortuitous. Two patients in this**
**small series each had a sister with breast cancer, one of them also had three other first-degree relations**
**with colon cancer. Three of the patients had other tumors as well as breast cancer. It is important to fully**
**investigate brain lesions in patients with breast cancer so that potentially curable meningiomas are not**
**mistaken for metastases.**
