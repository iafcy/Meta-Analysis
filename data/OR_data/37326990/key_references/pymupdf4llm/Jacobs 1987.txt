### Female Patients With Meningioma of the Sphenoid Ridge and Additional Primary Neoplasms of the Breast and Genital Tract

DANIEL H. JACOBS, MD, MICHAEL J. MCFARLANE, MD. AND FREDERICK F. HOLMES. MD

**Of 283 meningioma patients seen at the University of Kansas from 1948 to 1984, eight women acquired**
**two primary extraneural cancers in addition to** **their meningiomas.** **Of these eight patients, six (75%)**
**had sphenoid ridge meningiomas compared with 15% of meningioma patients overall (P < 0.001). Seven**
**(87.5%) had at least one breast or genital cancer ( P < 0.001). Of the six with sphenoid ridge menin-**
**giomas,** **five (83.3%) had both of their additional tumors in these two organ systems, and the sixth had**
**one such tumor.** **It** **is** **proposed that this grouping of sphenoid ridge meningioma, breast cancer, and**
**genital cancer represents a unique constellation of neoplasms in women.**
