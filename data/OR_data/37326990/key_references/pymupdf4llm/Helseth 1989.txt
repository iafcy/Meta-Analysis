The association between meningioma and a primary malignant neoplasm at another site was studied. The
data from the population-based Norwegian Cancer Registry were analysed according to whether the
meningioma occurred before or after the malignant neoplasm. Male patients with meningioma showed a
raised risk for developing a subsequent renal cancer. **A** significant association was found between
meningioma and subsequent breast cancer in females 50-64 years old at time of meningioma diagnosis and
between breast cancer and subsequent occurrence of meningioma. Breast cancer patients with symptoms
of an intracranial neoplasm may therefore have a potentially curable meningioma and female meningioma
patients over 50 years should be considered for breast cancer screening programmes.

Key words: Meningioma; renal cancer: breast cancer: multiple primary cancers.
