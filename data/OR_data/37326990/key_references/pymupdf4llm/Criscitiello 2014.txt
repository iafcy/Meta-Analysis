#### Abstract


Cancer
Epidemiology,
Biomarkers
& Prevention


Background: The etiology of meningioma is largely unknown, although breast cancer has been suggested to
play a role.
Methods: A monoinstitutional, retrospective analysis was performed at European Institute of Oncology on
12,330 patients with breast cancer. The cumulative incidence of meningioma was estimated using the Kaplan–
Meier method and the log-rank test was used to assess differences between groups.
Results: In total, 33 patients with meningioma were identified from a study population of 12,330, with a 10year cumulative incidence of meningioma of 0.37%. We did not find a significantly increased risk of
meningioma among patients with breast cancer or an association between the hormonal receptor status and
the risk of meningioma (P ¼ 0.65).
Conclusions: Our results do not support a role of breast cancer or endocrine treatments in meningioma
development.
Impact: This analysis adds new information on a debated topic. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 23(1);

#### Introduction

Meningiomas are typically benign tumors arising from
the meningothelial cells of the arachnoid membrane covering the brain and spinal cord. The etiology of meningiomas is largely unknown. There is evidence to suggest
that breast cancer may play a role in the development of
meningiomas, including the observation that these
tumors occur more commonly in women (1, 2). Further
evidence for a possible role for hormones in brain tumor
etiology includes the presence of progesterone (PgR),
estrogen (ER), and androgen receptors in some meningiomas, suggesting a link between breast cancer and meningiomas. Immunohistochemical studies have shown that
about 70% of meningiomas express PgR and about 30%
express ER, thus corroborating the hypothesis that meningioma is a hormone-sensitive tumor (3, 4). Our study was
carried out to explore the possible association between
breast cancer, endocrine therapy, and the risk of developing meningioma in a large monoinstitutional population of patients with breast cancer. We focused on endo

crine-responsive tumors to find a potential link between
these tumors and endocrine therapy.

#### Materials and Methods

Data from 12,330 women with early-stage breast cancer
who underwent surgery at the European Institute of
Oncology (IEO) in Milan between 1994 and 2011 were
retrieved from two institutional databases: the Breast
Cancer database, which contains information on patients
with breast cancer operated at IEO, and the Tumor Registry. Patients who received neoadjuvant treatment,
patients with a previous history of cancer, or patients
with metastatic breast cancer at diagnosis were excluded
from the analysis. Breast cancer–related data on age,
menopausal status, surgery, histopathology (Ki-67
expression, ER/PgR expression, and HER2 status) and
systemic treatment were analyzed. Usually, patients were
followed up with physical examination every 6 months,
annual mammography, breast ultrasound, andblood tests
every 6 to 12 months, and additional evaluations when
clinically indicated. Whenever possible, the health status
of women who did not come back for scheduled follow-up
visits for more than 1 year was obtained by phone contact.
Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective
analysis. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of meningioma (cum-inc ME), calculated from
breast surgery to meningioma diagnosis. The cum-inc ME
was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. The logrank test was used to assess differences between groups.
All analyses were carried out with the SAS software 9.3
(SAS Institute).

#### Results

From January 1994 to December 2011, we identified a
total of 12,330 consecutive patients with early-stage breast
cancer. At a median follow-up of 7 years, 33 patients with


meningioma were identified from a study population of
12,330. Table 1 describes selected demographic, clinical,
and pathologic characteristics of the study population at
the time of breast cancer surgery, systemic treatments

administered, number of meningiomas, and 10-year cuminc ME. Considering the entire population, the 10-year
cum-inc ME was 0.37% [95% confidence interval (CI),
0.26%–0.55%]. No association was found between ER/
PgR and the risk of meningioma. No association was
found if we matched analysis coupling ER and PgR (P
¼ 0.65) or considering them separately (ER, P ¼ 0.18 and
PgR, P ¼ 0.60). Patients who received aromatase inhibitors
had a trend of higher risk to develop meningioma
compared with patients who received tamoxifen, with
a borderline statistical significance (P ¼ 0.054). No other
significant association was observed in the analyzed
variables.

#### Discussion

This large, retrospective study evaluated more than
12,000 patients with breast cancer with an average follow-up period of 7 years, and identified a total of 33
individuals with an incident case of meningioma. There
was no significant association between meningioma
development and breast cancer. Use of aromatase inhibitors conferred a trend of increased risk of meningioma in
patients with breast cancer, although no statistical significance was observed. The link between breast cancer and
meningioma has been reported in literature, with discordant results. What is behind this association is quite
unclear, most likely being a hormonal etiology. Hormone
receptors are involved in both tumor types. In meningiomas, PgR is more prevalent and more biologically active
than ER. To ascertain a link between hormonal exposure
and development of meningioma, we focused on endocrine-responsive breast cancer and on patients receiving
endocrine therapy. In our cohort, the 10-year cum-inc ME
was 0.37% (95% CI, 0.26–0.55), similar to that reported by
Rao and colleagues (1). Our study has several limitations.

Breast Cancer and Meningioma

Despite the large cohort, a major limitation of this study is
the small number of meningioma cases recorded with
exposure to endocrine therapy. However, it has to be
acknowledged that the screening for meningioma is not
routinely conducted in patients with breast cancer. Also,
the endocrine therapy given to ER-positive patients may
have influenced the development of meningioma during
this period. Another limitation is related to the retrospective analysis. An important strength is that the records of
potential cases were manually reviewed and the case
status was validated by a data-monitoring system with
a confirmation rate of 100%. In summary, this study, in
contrast with previous cohort studies, found no association between development of meningioma and breast
cancer.
