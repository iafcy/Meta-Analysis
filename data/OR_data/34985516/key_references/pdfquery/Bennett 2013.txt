Objectives—To explore oxygenation and ventilation status early after cardiac arrest in infants 
and children. We hypothesize that hyperoxia is common and associated with worse outcome after 
pediatric cardiac arrest. 


Patients—Children who suffered a cardiac arrest event and survived for at least 6 hours after 
return of circulation. 

Measurements and Main Results—Analysis of 195 events revealed that abnormalities in 
oxygenation and ventilation are common during the initial 6 hours after pediatric cardiac arrest. 
Hyperoxia was frequent, affecting 54% of patients. Normoxia was documented in 34% and 
hypoxia in 22% of patients. These percentages account for a 10% overlap of patients who had both 
hyperoxia and hypoxia. Ventilation status was more evenly distributed with hyperventilation 
observed in 38%, normoventilation in 29%, and hypoventilation in 46%, with a 13% overlap of 
patients who had both hyperventilation and hypoventilation. Derangements in both oxygenation 
and ventilation were common early after cardiac arrest such that both normoxia and normocarbia 
were documented in only 25 patients (13%). Neither oxygenation nor ventilation status was 
associated with outcome. After controlling for potential confounders, arrest location and rhythm 
were significantly associated with worse outcome; however, hyperoxia was not (odds ratio for 
good outcome, 1.02 [0.46, 2.84]; p = 0.96).

Conclusions—Despite recent resuscitation guidelines that advocate maintenance of normoxia 
and normoventilation after pediatric cardiac arrest, this is uncommonly achieved in practice. 
Although we did not demonstrate an association between hyperoxia and worse outcome, the small 
proportion of patients kept within normal ranges limited our power. Preclinical data suggesting 
potential harm with hyperoxia remain compelling, and further investigation, including prospective, 
large studies involving robust recording of physiological derangements, is necessary to further 
advance our understanding of this important topic. 


Cardiac arrest (CA) affects approximately eight per 100,000 children in North America 
annually and causes high mortality and morbidity (1). Out-of-hospital (OH) CA has reported 
survival to hospital discharge of 2% to 12%, with intact neurological function in only 2% to 
4% (1–3). In-hospital (IH) CA has slightly better outcomes with reported survival of 
approximately 25% and favorable neurological outcome in approximately 18% (4, 5). 
Treatment after CA is largely supportive and directed toward minimizing end-organ injury. 
Aside from rapid, effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and application of 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in select populations, no specific therapy 
has been shown to improve survival or outcomes after CA in children. 
Supplemental oxygen therapy remains central to care during and after resuscitation. An 
association between hypoxia and poor outcome after CA has long been accepted. However, 
more recently, concerns about potentially detrimental effects of hyperoxia have been raised. 
Neonatal resuscitation reports show worse long-term outcomes with greater inspired 
concentrations of oxygen and higher oxygen saturations during resuscitation (6, 7). 
Similarly, some adult studies link hyperoxia with poorer outcomes (8, 9), although others do 
not (10). 
The 2010 American Heart Association (AHA) Neonatal Resuscitation Guidelines 
recommend beginning resuscitation with room air for term infants (or a blended mixture of 
oxygen and air for preterm infants) with subsequent titration of inspired oxygen fraction 
based on pulse oximetry values (11). Similarly, the 2010 AHA Adult Advanced Cardiac Life 
Support Guidelines recommend initial resuscitation with 100% oxygen and then titration of 
inspired oxygen fraction after return of circulation (ROC) to target oxygen saturation greater 
than or equal to 94% (12, 13). Although investigations of hyperoxia and outcomes after CA 
in children are lacking, the 2010 AHA Pediatric Advanced Life Support Guidelines similarly 
recommend initial resuscitation with 100% oxygen and consideration of titrating oxygen 
delivery after ROC to achieve oxygen saturation greater than or equal to 94% (14). 
Ventilatory support, another mainstay of resuscitation and supportive care, has also been 
linked with altered outcomes after CA. Hyperventilation reduces cerebral blood flow and is 
associated with hypotension during resuscitation (15). The 2010 AHA Adult Advanced 
Cardiac Life Support and Post-Cardiac Arrest Care Guidelines advocate avoiding 
hypocarbia (12, 13). Similarly, the 2010 AHA Pediatric Advanced Life Support Guidelines 
state that hyperventilation has no benefit and may be harmful (14). Reports of 
hyperventilation after CA in children are lacking; however, hyperventilation has been 
associated with adverse outcomes in children after stroke or traumatic brain injury (16–18) 
and in neonates after resuscitation from birth asphyxia (19). 
In this study, we explore oxygenation and ventilation status early after CA in infants and 
children. Our primary hypothesis is that hyperoxia is common and associated with worse 



outcome. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a retrospective cohort study involving children 
who suffered CA yet survived for at least 20 mins after ROC. 

We queried a pediatric CA database that was generated during planning for two 
simultaneous multicenter, randomized controlled trials of therapeutic hypothermia after 
pediatric CA (the THAPCA Trials, http://www.thapca.org/) (20). The database, previously 
described in detail (21–23), was populated by retrospective review of pediatric CA events 
that occurred between July 1, 2003, and December 31, 2004, at 15 hospitals within the 
Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network. All children 24 hours to 18 years of 
age (inclusive) who experienced CA with ROC for greater than or equal to 20 mins and 
were treated at a participating center were eligible for database inclusion. Patients cared for 
in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit or who experienced planned CA as part of cardiac surgery 
were excluded from the initial cohort. The study populating the database was granted 
approval with waiver of consent at all participating studies. The current study met 
exemption criteria for the institutional review board, as it utilized an existing database that 
contained only de-identified data. 
The database contains: 1) patient characteristics (e.g., demographics, chronic preexisting 
conditions); 2) event characteristics (e.g., location of CA, first recorded cardiac rhythm, 
presence and type of vascular access); 3) etiology of CA; 4) hospital course (e.g., use of 
ECMO, therapeutic hypothermia); 5) physiological and laboratory data; 6) Pediatric 
Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) scores at baseline (pre-CA) and at hospital 
discharge; and 7) survival to hospital discharge. Both IH and OH CA events are included. 
CA is defined as receiving CPR with greater than 1 min of chest compressions. IH CA is 
defined as chest compressions initiated in an emergency department or other hospital setting 
and OH CA as chest compressions initiated prior to hospital arrival. ROC includes either 
spontaneous or assisted (e.g., ECMO) circulation. Duration of OH CA was poorly captured, 
but the number of epinephrine doses administered during CPR is available as a surrogate 
marker. 
For the current study, we excluded: 1) subjects with a diagnosis related to cyanotic heart 
disease including any single ventricle physiology; 2) subjects lacking documentation of both 
an indwelling arterial catheter and at least one recorded Pao2 value during the first 6 hrs 
post-CA; 3) subjects who died within the first 6 hours post-CA; and 4) subjects missing 
PCPC scores at baseline or at hospital discharge. We defined the following fields: 
preexisting condition as any identified chronic illness, CA etiology as respiratory or cardiac 
(nonexclusive), and rhythm during CA as presence of asystole, ventricular fibrillation/ 
ventricular tachycardia, other, or missing (hierarchical). The location of CA was further 
refined for IH to have occurred in an ICU (IH-ICU) or another location (IH-other). 
In the database, physiological and laboratory data are recorded as minimum and maximum 
values during select time periods. Because the risk of injury due to hyperoxia may be 
greatest early after reperfusion (24), our primary exposure of oxygenation status was from 
the period 0 to 6 hours post-CA. If there was only one value provided, it was assigned as 
both the minimum and the maximum values. The cutoff for hyperoxia, Pao2 greater than 200 
mm Hg (26.7 kPa), was chosen as a compromise between neonatal (6, 7) and adult (8–10) 
reports, which used cutoffs ranging from a pulse oximetry reading greater than 94% to a 
Pao2 greater than 300 mm Hg (40 kPa); however, we also explored cutoffs of 100 mm Hg 
(13.3 kPa) and 300 mm Hg (40 kPa) by sensitivity analyses. The cutoff for hypoxia, Pao2 
less than 50 mm Hg (4.0 kPa), was chosen to roughly correspond to a pulse oximetry 
reading less than 80%. Other physiological and laboratory variables were categorized as 



follows: hyperventilation as Paco2 less than 30 mm Hg (4.0 kPa); hypoventilation as Paco2 
greater than 50 mm Hg (6.7 kPa); hypotension as systolic blood pressure less than fifth 
percentile for age (Pediatric Advanced Life Support criteria); hypothermia as temperature 
less than 35°C (excludes therapeutically induced hypothermia, which comprises a separate 
variable); fever as temperature greater than 38°C (25, 26); hyperglycemia as serum glucose 
concentration greater than 240 mg/dL (13.32 mmol/L) (27); and hypoglycemia as serum 
glucose concentration less than 40 mg/dL (2.22 mmol/L). Overall oxygenation status in the 
first 6 hrs post-CA was defined as hyperoxia (with no hypoxia), hypoxia (with no 
hyperoxia), both hyperoxia and hypoxia, and normoxia throughout interval. Overall 
ventilation status was similarly defined. 
Our primary outcome variable was survival to hospital discharge with good neurological 
outcome. Good neurological outcome was defined by discharge PCPC score 1–2 (normal or 
mild disability) or no change in PCPC score between pre-CA and discharge. Conversely, 
poor neurological outcome was defined by discharge PCPC 3–6 (moderate or severe 
disability or death) or for those with an abnormal PCPC score pre-CA, any worsening. 
Hospital mortality was evaluated as a secondary outcome. 

For continuous variables, medians and interquartile ranges (25th–75th percentile) are 
reported. For categorical variables, counts and percentages are reported. The association of 
each variable with outcome was examined using the Wilcoxon's rank sum or Kruskal-Wallis 
test for continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. 
We also described the association of oxygenation and ventilation status with key patient and 
CA characteristics. For the association of hyperoxia with outcome, sensitivity analyses were 
performed using cutoffs of Pao2 greater than 100 (13.3 kPa) and Pao2 greater than 300 (40.0 
kPa), in addition to the defined cutoff of Pao2 greater than 200 (26.7 kPa). 
Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the potential association between 
early (0–6 hrs) derangements in oxygenation and ventilation with outcome after pediatric 
CA. Factors that might confound the association between outcome and oxygenation and/or 
ventilation were examined. All variables with a p value less than 0.15 in univariable analysis 
were eligible for inclusion in the logistic regression model. Forward stepwise selection was 
applied, and factors were removed from the model if p values were greater than 0.05. In 
addition, based on reported associations with outcome after pediatric CA, we decided a 
priori to include the following in all models regardless of statistical significance: location of 
CA, patient age, number of epinephrine doses, and cardiac rhythm during CA. Similarly, 
based on our primary hypothesis, we decided a priori to include hyperoxia regardless of 
statistical significance. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 for Windows (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC). 
Four hundred ninety-one pediatric CA events were available for analysis. After exclusions, a 
final cohort of 195 remained (Fig. 1). Hyperoxia occurred in 54% of the cohort, normoxia in 
34%, and hypoxia in 22%. These percentages account for a 10% overlap of patients who had 
both hyperoxia and hypoxia. Ventilation status was more evenly distributed with hyper- 
ventilation observed in 38%, normoventilation in 29%, and hypoventilation in 46%. Patients 
with both hyperventilation and hypoventilation account for a 13% overlap. Derangements in 
both oxygenation and ventilation, such as hyperoxia and hypocarbia, were common. 
Surprisingly, both normoxia and normocarbia were maintained during the initial 6 hrs post- 
CA in only 25 of the 195 patients (13%). 




Demographics and CA characteristics were not statistically different across oxygenation 
groups (Table 1). Interestingly, intubation prior to CA did not influence oxygenation status; 
the proportions of patients intubated prior to CA were similar across groups (hyperoxia: 
45%, normoxia or hypoxia: each 41%, hyperoxia and hyperoxia: 40%, p = 0.37). Post-CA 
features did not differ by oxygenation group with the following exceptions (Table 1). 
Ventilation status differed in that the majority of hyperoxic patients were hyperventilated, 
whereas normoxic or hypoxic patients were most commonly hypoventilated. Approximately 
one-third of either hyperoxic or normoxic patients were normoventilated compared with less 
than 10% of hypoxic patients. ECMO support and spontaneous hypothermia were less 
frequent among normoxic than hyperoxic and/or hypoxic patients. PICU and hospital days 
post-CA were similar across oxygenation groups. 
Demographics and CA characteristics were not statistically different across ventilation 
groups (data not shown). Intubation prior to CA was most common among hyperventilated 
patients (50%) and least common among normoventilated patients (37%), but the 
differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.18). Post-CA features also did not 
differ across ventilation groups with the exception of oxygenation status (data not shown). 
The associations for concurrent ventilation and oxygenation status are discussed above. 
PICU and hospital days post-CA did not differ by ventilation group. 
About 37% of the cohort survived with good neurological outcome (Table 2). Outcome did 
not differ by demographics except that a preexisting condition was more common among 
those who survived with good outcome. Good outcomes were relatively more common 
among IH CA, cardiac etiology of CA, no documented asystole, and fewer epinephrine 
doses during resuscitation. Outcome did not differ by oxygenation or ventilation status. In 
contrast, poor outcomes were associated with spontaneous hypothermia and hyperglycemia. 
Other physiological variables, including hypotension, ECMO support, hypoglycemia, fever, 
and therapeutic hypothermia, were not associated with outcome (data not shown). 
Interestingly, a greater documented change in body temperature during the initial 6 hrs post- 
CA was associated with poor outcome (median [IQR], 1.7 [0.6, 3.3] for poor vs. 1.1 [0.4, 
1.8] for good outcome, p = 0.002). All patients who survived to PICU discharge survived to 
hospital discharge. Among survivors, 76% were discharged home, 17% were transferred to 
rehabilitation, and 7% were transferred to either another acute care facility or long-term care 
(data not shown). 
Survival with good outcome was 34% for those with hyperoxia and 42% for those without 
(p = 0.23). This lack of association remained true in sensitivity analysis using cutoffs of 100 
or 300 mm Hg (13.3 or 40 kPa). Hospital mortality was also similar between those with and 
without hyperoxia (56% and 52%, p = 0.60). Although OH CA, presence of asystole, greater 
number of epinephrine doses during CPR, development of spontaneous hypothermia, greater 
change in temperature during the first 6 hrs post-CA, and hyperglycemia were all associated 
with poor outcome in univariable analysis, only CA location and cardiac rhythm during CA 
remained significantly associated with outcome in the multivariable setting (Table 3). The 
adjusted odds of survival with good outcome were very similar for those with and without 
hyperoxia (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.46, 2.27). This remained true when 
we excluded the 10 neonates in our cohort (odds ratio 0.925, 95% confidence interval 0.40, 
2.12). 

Our most striking finding is that only 13% of pediatric patients were maintained both 
normoxic and normoventilated early post-CA. This is surprising, particularly given that 



current AHA pediatric resuscitation guidelines advocate maintaining normal oxygenation 
and ventilation (14). Our study includes mainly resuscitation efforts at large, experienced 
pediatric centers. In addition, the location of CA (IH-ICU, IH-other, or OH) and intubation 
prior to CA were not associated with the frequency of normoxia and normoventilation. This 
suggests that although maintaining normal oxygenation and ventilation status is advocated, 
it remains difficult to achieve in practice throughout a range of resuscitation settings. Likely, 
factors associated with both resuscitation practices and patient physiology contribute to this. 
For example, hyperoxia likely results from administration of high FiO2 in the absence of 
significant respiratory disease, whereas hypoxia likely stems from the presence of 
significant respiratory disease. Further, a study of resuscitation team performance during 
simulated pediatric CA events at a tertiary care, academic pediatric center revealed that 
hyperventilation was quite common during simulated resuscitation (28). A recent report of 
actual pediatric resuscitation events corroborated this, with hyperventilation being observed 
in 63% of resuscitations (29). Targeted efforts are needed to increase adherence with current 
oxygenation and ventilation guidelines. 
Contrary to our primary hypothesis, we did not demonstrate an association between 
hyperoxia early post-CA and outcome. This differs from reports of worse outcomes in 
hyperoxic neo-nates with birth asphyxia (30–33) and from preclinical studies that suggest 
greater oxidative stress and worse functional and histological outcomes with hyperoxic vs. 
normoxic resuscitation (34–37). However, it falls in line with mixed reports of 
postresuscitation oxygenation status and outcomes in adults (8–10, 38). 
The distribution of oxygenation status in our cohort differs from that reported in adults. 
Hyperoxia affected 54% of our cohort (includes isolated hyperoxia and combined hypoxia 
and hyperoxia) vs. 10% to 18% of adults (8, 10). Hypoxia occurred in 22% of our cohort vs. 
63% to 74% of adults. Normoxia was maintained in 34% of our population vs. 16% to 19% 
of adults. These differences suggest that children likely have different responses to 
resuscitation and/or less severe hypoxic lung disease than adults. Given these differences, 
extrapolation of adult data regarding hyperoxia and outcomes after CA may not be 
appropriate. 
We did not observe an association between ventilation status and outcome in our population. 
This differs from a study showing two-fold increased odds of poor outcome with 
hyperventilation (vs. normoventilation) after resuscitation from birth asphyxia (19) and from 
the reports of detrimental effects of hyperventilation in other types of pediatric acute 
cerebral injury (16–18). 
Our report corroborates prior studies linking outcome after CA with arrest location (4, 39) or 
cardiac rhythm (5, 40, 41) and suggesting that post-CA hyperglycemia (27, 42) and 
spontaneous hypothermia (44) may be detrimental. Prior publications describe these 
associations in detail for the parent cohort of our study (21– 23). We also report a greater 
change in temperature during the first 6 hours post-resuscitation among those with poor 
outcome. Although it remains unclear whether spontaneous hypothermia is directly causal or 
merely associated with poorer outcome after CA, our findings support reports that the rate 
and degree of rewarming may be important (26, 43–45). Alternatively, our observations may 
simply reflect longer durations of CA, which could contribute to lower initial temperature, 
greater change with rewarming, and poorer outcomes. In either case, exacerbation of 
spontaneous hypothermia due to heat loss during transport and exacerbation of 
hyperglycemia should be avoided post-CA. 
Strengths of our study include use of a robust, pediatric CA database that includes 
laboratory, physiological and outcome data from patients treated at 15 pediatric hospitals. 



All included subjects had arterial blood gas data to classify oxygenation and ventilation 
status. This allowed more precise discrimination of oxygenation or ventilation status than 
use of respiratory rate or pulse oximetery readings. 
Our study has several limitations that may have hindered our ability to demonstrate an 
association between hyperoxia and outcome after pediatric CA. First, the unanticipated 
small percentage of patients who were maintained normoxic and normoventilated limited 
our study power. Second, availability of physiological data as only maximum and minimum 
values during specified time periods, rather than all tested values, precluded precise 
temporal assessments. In addition, our focus on the earliest period postresuscitation (0–6 
hrs) may not represent the most crucial period of exposure. Longer periods or different 
timing of exposure may be necessary to affect outcomes. Exposure to suboptimal 
oxygenation or ventilation prior to hospital arrival may not have been well captured for OH- 
CA, which would introduce heterogeneity regarding the types and durations of exposures 
and the time between ROC and initial blood gas measurement. Similarly, our categories of 
CA etiology are broad, necessarily introducing some heterogeneity and limiting our ability 
to address effects of suboptimal oxygenation or ventilation by more specific CA etiology. 
Our selection of patients who had an arterial catheter placed also likely selected for greater 
severity of illness, which may limit our ability to discern more subtle effects of hyperoxia. 
Finally, the data were collected retrospectively, adding the multiple limitations inherent to 
any retrospective database, including missing data for some variables. 

Our study reveals that although recent resuscitation guidelines advocate maintenance of 
normoxia and normoventilation after pediatric CA, this is uncommonly achieved in practice. 
We did not demonstrate an association between hyperoxia and outcome after pediatric CA. 
However, due to the small proportion of patients kept within normal ranges, our sample size 
was limiting. The preclinical data suggesting potential harm with hyperoxia remain 
compelling, and further investigation, including prospective, large studies involving more 
robust recording of physiological derangements, is necessary to further advance our 
understanding of this important topic.
