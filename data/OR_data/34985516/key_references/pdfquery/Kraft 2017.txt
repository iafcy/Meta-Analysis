Background: Mechanical ventilation with oxygen is life-saving, 
however, may result in hyperoxia. The aim was to analyse the 
incidence and duration of hyperoxia burden and related in-hospi- 
tal mortality in critically ill patients. 
Methods: Patients of all ages admitted to intensive care units 
(ICUs) and with mechanical ventilation for at least seven consecu- 
tive days were included in this single centre retrospective medical 
record audit. The main outcome measure was time-weighted arte- 
rial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) over 7 days. Logistic regres- 
sion for association with in-hospital mortality and propensity 
score matching was performed. 
In total, 20,889 arterial blood gases of 419 patients were 
Results: 
analysed. Time-weighted mean PaO2 was 14.0 (cid:1) 2.4 kPa. Time- 
weighted mean FiO2 was 49.2 (cid:1) 12.1%. Seventy-six (18.1%) 
patients showed continuous hyperoxia exposure, deﬁned as time- 
weighted mean PaO2 > 16 kPa. Duration of hyperoxia, hypoxia 
(PaO2 < 8 kPa) 
8–16 kPa) were 
37.9 (cid:1) 31.0 h (23.7%), 4.9 (cid:1) 9.5 h (3.1%), and 116.8 (cid:1) 29.6 h 
(73.2%). Hyperoxia occurred especially at low to moderate FiO2 
in patients of ﬁrst and second age quartiles (1–57 years) with 
smaller SAPS2 score. In-hospital mortality of patients with hyper- 
oxia (32.9%) or normoxia did not differ (35.9%; P = 0.691). Con- 
ditional 
regression showed no association between 
hyperoxia and in-hospital mortality (OR 1.46; 95%CI 0.72–2.96; 
P = 0.29). 
Conclusion: Substantial hyperoxia burden was observed in ICU 
patients. Young patients with less comorbidities showed hyper- 
oxic episodes more often, especially with lower FiO2. Hyperoxia 
during 7 days of mechanical ventilation did not correlate to 
increased in-hospital mortality. 







Editorial comment 
Exposure to high inspired oxygen levels over many days is thought to be potentially injurious. In 
this retrospective analysis, at least one week’s high inspired oxygen in critically ill ventilated 
patients did not show increased risk for in-hospital mortality or length of stay, compared to a 
matched cohort with no hyperoxia exposure. 

An international journal of anaesthesiology, intensive 
care, pain, and critical emergency medicine 
In the intensive care unit (ICU), supplemental 
oxygen (O2) during invasive mechanical ventila- 
tion (IMV) is routinely administered in patients 
with acute respiratory failure to prevent from 
organ hypoxia. Beyond doubt, severe hypoxia 
can contribute to increased ICU morbidity and 
mortality. Therefore, it has been suggested for 
years that critically ill patients would beneﬁt 
from a more liberal O2 therapy, 
taking into 
account 
that episodes of accidental hyperoxia 
may also harm the lungs and remote organs. 


Recently, it has been proposed that accidental 
hyperoxia may play a key role in determining 
patient clinical outcome. Reactive O2 species, 
mainly derived from mitochondrial oxidative 
metabolism with its cytochrome oxidase system, 
cause inﬂammatory as well as cytotoxic pro- 
cesses during hyperoxic episodes.1–3 A retro- 
spective study by De Jonge et al. from 2008 
demonstrated a U-shaped association between 
arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and 
in-hospital mortality,4 suggesting that both sev- 
ere hypoxia and hyperoxia on the ﬁrst day of 
ICU admission, may worsen clinical outcome. 
However, Eastwood et al. could not conﬁrm 
these ﬁndings in a large retrospective data anal- 
ysis published in 2012.5 Several smaller retro- 
ICU subsets, 
spective 
including patients admitted for stroke, traumatic 
brain injury, and cardiac arrest also found a cor- 
relation between hyperoxia and increased in- 
hospital mortality. Two recent meta-analyses by 
Damiani et al. in 2014 and Helmerhorst et al. in 
2015 conclude that hyperoxia may be associated 
with poor in-hospital outcome, however, sug- 
gest that more clinical evidence is required to 
better tailor for optimal individual O2 targets.6,7 
Oxygen must be regarded as any other drug 
with potential dose- and time-depended side 
effects. It 
is not clearly understood, whether 
longer exposure (e.g., several days after ICU 
admission) with signiﬁcantly elevated oxygen 
levels result in higher morbidity and mortality. 
Clinical evidence on the impact of prolonged 
hyperoxia in ICU patients is lacking, as actual 
studies only focus on short observation periods 
(e.g., the ﬁrst day of ICU admission). 
Therefore, the aim of this study was to retro- 
spectively analyse the incidence and duration of 
hyperoxia burden in ICU patients. A mixed sur- 
ICU 
gical and anaesthesiological 

patients undergoing IMV for at least 7 days was 
investigated to estimate hyperoxic burden dur- 
ing long-term IMV. Hyperoxic burden was cor- 
related with in-hospital mortality to determine 
if prolonged hyperoxia exposure may be associ- 
ated with poor clinical outcome in ICU patients. 


This single centre retrospective medical record 
audit was performed in accordance with the Dec- 
laration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics 
Committee of the Medical University of Vienna, 
Austria (No. 1428/2014, approved by Prof. Ernst 
Singer on 15.07.2014). The study data consist of 
retrospective data subsets collected from seven 
surgical and anaesthesiological ICUs of the Medi- 
cal University of Vienna, Austria, collected from 
January 1st 2009 until April 22nd 2013 with 
12909 (3040 (cid:1) 250 annually) admitted patients of 
which 6735 (1579 (cid:1) 89 annually) received IMV. 
All patients submitted to one of the ICUs, either 
planned or unplanned as well as medical or surgi- 
cal, undergoing positive pressure IMV for at least 
seven consecutive days after ICU admission were 
included in the study. The primary outcome vari- 
able was time-weighted PaO2 during 7 days of 
IMV. Due to the retrospective character of the 
study, no informed consent of patients or relatives 
was obtained and the study was not registered in 
a clinical trials database. Patient data sets with 
missing values were excluded from the analysis. 
As all suitable data sets were included, no sample 
size calculation was performed. 

The following variables were extracted from the 
sampling data set for each patient: continuously 
digitally recorded peripheral hemoglobin O2 
saturation (SaO2, %) measured by pulse oxime- 
try, and fraction of 
inspired O2 (FiO2, %) 
assessed from respirator settings; PaO2 (kPa) 
and hemoglobin (g/dl) measured by repetitive 
daily arterial blood gas analyses (ABG) as pre- 
scribed by the attending physician. Also, num- 
ber of ABG samples during the observation 
period of seven consecutive days after 
ICU 
admission, and duration between each recorded 




ABG value in the study period were collected 
from the patient medical records. The issue of 
consecutive or missing data values was handled 
as follows. It was assumed that recorded ABG 
values remained stable over time until a new 
physiological value was recorded. 

Demographic data, the Simpliﬁed Acute Physi- 
ology Score 2 (SAPS2) on ICU admission, 
Hospital length of stay (HLOS), ICU length of 
stay (ICU-LOS), ICU mortality and in-hospital 
mortality were obtained from the patient medi- 
cal records. 



Time-weighted mean values of PaO2 (PaO2.w- 
mean, kPa) and FiO2 (FiO2.wmean, %) were cal- 
culated by multiplying the measured individual 
value with the duration until the next value was 
obtained divided by the complete time of observa- 
tion and then taking the sum of all values per 
patient. 
hyperoxic 
duration 
(PaO2 > 16 kPa, h), normoxic (PaO2 8–16 kPa, h) 
and hypoxic (PaO2 < 8 kPa, h) episodes were 
identiﬁed. In addition, duration of FiO2 > 50% 
was calculated and deﬁned as high FiO2. Also, the 
maximal PaO2 value (PaO2.max, kPa) 
that 
occurred during the 7 days of observation was 
determined for each patient. Patients experiencing 
(PaO2.wmean > 16 kPa, 
continuous hyperoxia 
PaO2.H) and patients experiencing normoxia 
(PaO2.wmean of 8–16 kPa, PaO2.N) during all 
7 days of observation were identiﬁed to test for 
statistical differences between groups. 
All physiological and demographic patient data 
was gathered from the routine ICU documenta- 
tion software (CareVue Version 12, Phillips Med- 
ical Systems, Andover, MA, USA 2001). 
Microsoft 
Inc., 
Redmond, Washington) was used to create an 
anonymized patient database of all collected 
physiological and demographic patient data. 




For continuous variables mean and SD and for 
categorical variables absolute and relative fre- 
quencies were calculated. Student’s t-test was 

used for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact 
test was used for categorical variables to analyse 
differences in distributions of covariates. 


A propensity score matching was applied to 
create a balanced subsample of patients. The 
(i.e., 
treatment 
PaO2.wmean > 16 kPa). For each patient, 
the 
probability of being assigned to the hyperoxia 
group (=propensity score) was calculated from a 
logistic regression model, where hyperoxia was 
modeled as a function of the following covari- 
ates: age, sex, HLOS, FiO2.wmean, PaO2.max, 
SAPS2, duration of PaO2 < 8 kPa, duration of 
FiO2 > 50% and admission diagnose. Matching 
was done in a 1 : 1 ratio using the nearest 
neighbor method as 
implemented in the 
R-package “MatchIt”.8 


Using the matched dataset, a conditional 
logistic regression for matched pairs was calcu- 
of hyperoxia 
lated to 
the 
(PaO2.H), PaO2.wmean and PaO2.max 
on 
in-hospital mortality. 
In addition, a logistic 
regression model using all patients with in-hos- 
and 
pital mortality as dependent variable 
PaO2.H and the propensity score as independent 
covariates was created. Time-weighted mean 
PaO2 values were adapted as predictor variable 
for the logistic regression by only using the 
results of day two to seven for calculation, 
because PaO2 is also included in the SAPS2. 
Thereby an overrepresentation of PaO2 in the 
model was avoided. The signiﬁcance level for 
all tests was 5%. Calculations were performed 
using the software program R 3.2.0 (www.r-pro 
ject.com, Vienna, Austria). 


The analysis was based on 419 of 554 patients 
(75.6%) with complete data sets over seven con- 
secutive days. Twenty-nine patients 
(5.2%) 
were excluded from the analysis due to missing 
values for the calculation of SAPS2 score and 
106 patients (19.1%) were lacking daily ABG 
results during the observation period (Fig. 1). 
The collective consisted of 161 female (38.4%) 
and 258 male (61.6%) patients with a SAPS2 of 
46 (cid:1) 18.6. Mean age was 57.8 (cid:1) 19.9 years and 
ranged from 1 to 91 years. Nineteen patients

(4.5%) were adolescent during observation with 
ﬁve patients being younger than 6 years (1.2%). 
The PaO2.wmean and in-hospital mortality of 
the excluded patients did not differ signiﬁcantly 
from the ﬁnal study sample. The median ICU 
stay was 22 days (range 7–189) with an ICU 
mortality of 30.1% (n = 126). Overall in-hospital 
mortality in the study sample was 35.3% 
(n = 148). Additional descriptive patient data is 
displayed in Table 1. 


(in average 
In total, 
49.9 (cid:1) 12 ABGs per patient) were analysed. 
Unweighted mean PaO2 was 14.5 (cid:1) 6.7 kPa and 
PaO2.wmean was 14.0 (cid:1) 2.4 kPa in all patients 
over the whole time of observation. Intraday 
variability in PaO2.wmean was highest on the 
ﬁrst day of IMV on ICU (Fig. 2). PaO2.max was 
34.4 (cid:1) 15.3 kPa. A total number of 76 patients 
(18.1%) showed hyperoxic PaO2.wmean values 
(PaO2.H) and 343 patients (81.9%) showed 
PaO2.wmean values between 8–16 kPa, deﬁned 
as normoxic (PaO2.N). A PaO2.wmean < 8 kPa 
was not observed in any patient. Calculated 
duration of hyperoxia, normoxia and hypoxia in 
the study period was 37.9 (cid:1) 31.0 h (23.7%), 
116.8 (cid:1) 29.6 h (73.2%), and 4.9 (cid:1) 9.5 h (3.1%), 
shown in Fig. 3. Patients

of 
52.8 (cid:1) 15% and FiO2.wmean of 49.2 (cid:1) 12.4% 
during the study period. 



Group differences between PaO2.H and 
PaO2.N are displayed in Table 2. There was no 
difference between PaO2.H and PaO2.N in terms 
of in-hospital mortality (P = 0.691), ICU-mortal- 
ity (P = 0.491) or SAPS2 (P = 0.073). Signiﬁcant 
differences between PaO2.H and PaO2.N were 
observed for HLOS (P = 0.0003), 
ICU-LOS 
(P = 0.039), PaO2.max (P < 0.0001), and age 
with the patients of the PaO2.H group being 
(43.3 (cid:1) 21.6 years vs. 57.3 (cid:1) 
much younger 
18.6 years; P < 0.0001, Fig. 4). Also, the PaO2.H 
(1.7 (cid:1) 3.1 h vs. 
group was 
5.6 (cid:1) 10.2 h; P < 0.0001), even though, overall 
receiving lower 
levels of FiO2 (FiO2.wmean 
42.8 (cid:1) 9.9% vs. 50.7 (cid:1) 12.1%; P < 0.0001, and 
high FiO2 30.9 h vs. 63.2 h; P < 0.0001). 




Patients, who deceased during hospital stay 
were signiﬁcantly older (P < 0.0001), had higher 
SAPS2 (P < 0.0001), shorter HLOS (P < 0.0001), 
(52.5 (cid:1) 14.2% vs. 
a 
47.5 (cid:1) 10.4%; P = 0.0002) and longer duration 
(P = 0.0005). The duration of 
of high FiO2 
hypoxia was 
patients 
doubled 
(6.8 (cid:1) 11.8 h vs. 3.8 (cid:1) 7.6 h; P = 0.005). No dif- 
ference in PaO2.wmean, PaO2.max, or duration 
of hyperoxia was observed compared to patients 
discharged alive (Table S1). 



Due to the inhomogeneity in the study sample, 
to every patient of the PaO2.H group one patient 
of the PaO2.N group with similar propensity 
score was matched to compensate baseline dif- 
ferences. The ﬁnal matched collective consisted 
of 76 pairs of patients while 267 normoxic 
patients were not used for further analyses. The 
median ICU stay of 
the matched pairs was 
19 days (range 7–118) with an ICU mortality of

P = 0.57) as compared to matched patients of 
the PaO2.N group, without being statistically 
signiﬁcant. 



Univariate 
regression 
showed that PaO2.wmean (OR 0.992; 95%CI 
0.981–1.004; P = 0.173) and prolonged hyper- 
oxia (PaO2.H) (OR 0.877; 95%CI 0.518-1.485; 
P = 0.625) were not related to in-hospital mor- 
tality in the complete sample of 419 patients. In 
the logistic regression using the full data while 
adjusting for the propensity score the odds ratio 
of hyperoxia for in-hospital mortality was 1.25 
(95%CI 0.64–2.42; P = 0.51) without being sta- 
tistically signiﬁcant. The conditional 
logistic 
regression for the matched data showed that the 
effect of hyperoxia as nominal variable (PaO2.H 
and PaO2.N) on in-hospital mortality was not 
statistically signiﬁcant (OR 1.46; 95%CI 0.72– 
2.96; P = 0.29). PaO2.wmean (OR 1.017, 95%CI 
0.9954–1.039; P = 0.124) and PaO2.max (OR 
1.003, 95%CI 0.9982–1.008; P = 0.226) were 
also no predictors for in-hospital mortality in 
the conditional logistic regression. 


The present single centre ICU retrospective med- 
ical record audit investigated the incidence of

hyperoxia and related in-hospital mortality in 
critically ill patients. Our study was the ﬁrst 
investigating daily hyperoxia burden over seven 
consecutive days in patients undergoing IMV. 
PaO2.wmean values showed the highest vari- 
ability and mean on the ﬁrst day of IMV on 
ICU. Continuous hyperoxia occurred in 23.7% 
of observation period. Our results demonstrated 
that hyperoxic episodes predominantly occurred 
in younger patients 
levels 
≤ 50%. The occurrence of hyperoxia showed no 
effect on in-hospital and ICU mortality, duration 
of ICU stay or overall hospitalization as com- 
pared to normoxia exposure. 


In contrast to former studies, we did not investi- 
gate only one single PaO2 value but calculated 
mean PaO2 over time. Also, the studied ICU 
patients underwent IMV for at least seven con- 
secutive days while most published research is 
based on ﬁrst 24–48 h after ICU admission. As 
recently suggested by Helmerhorst et al., clinical 
studies investigating this topic should not only 
take into account solitary PaO2 values on ICU 
admission but also instead investigate for time- 
averaged mean of PaO2 and other values to 
determine hyperoxic burden of ICU patients.9 
With the given study design, we could iden- 
tify patients being exposed to hyperoxia beyond 
doubt. ABG results showed that intraday vari- 
ability and mean PaO2 values were highest on 
the ﬁrst day of observation period with 184 
patients (43.9%) presenting hyperoxia. This 
ﬁnding is similar to another study reporting 
49.8% of hyperoxic patients on ﬁrst day of ICU 
admission.5 Only including data from the ﬁrst 
day of admission could have been misleading 
on the actual exposure to hyperoxia of patients. 
We could show that continuous hyperoxia, in 
terms of time-weighted mean of PaO2 > 16 kPa, 
occurred in 23.7% during the entire observation 
period. These ﬁndings demonstrate that hyper- 
oxia frequently occurs in ICU patients, despite 
standard operating procedures on ICU aiming for 
reduction in excessive O2 levels. ICU patients are 
exposed to a signiﬁcant hyperoxic burden over 
time. A recent meta-analysis published in 2014 
by Damiani et al. concluded that one of the main 
issues in comparing literature regarding this 
relevant topic is the heterogeneity of ICU patients 
in mixed collectives, different deﬁnitions of 
hyperoxia (e.g., PaO2 > 16 kPa, PaO2 > 40 kPa), 
the values used for 
as well as selection of

being 






retrospective 
Furthermore, 
cohort 
also examining mixed ICU 
patients receiving IMV used that deﬁnition for 
hyperoxia, which enables us to more reliably 
compare our results to former studies. 





This study results did not ﬁnd a correlation 
between hyperoxia and increased in-hospital 
mortality. Normoxic patients 
showed lower 
in-hospital and ICU mortality compared to 
hyperoxic patients, without being statistically 
signiﬁcant. As the absolute risk reduction was 
close to eight percent for normoxia, this is a 
promising trend for 
following investigations 
with a higher number of studied patients. Also, 
Girardis et al. reported an absolute risk reduction 
of 8.6% in their conservative group targeting for 
10 Unfortu- 
lower PaO2 and SpO2 in ICU patients. 
nately, they had to stop enrolling patients early 
and thereby missed the calculated sample size for 
the primary outcome ICU mortality. 
Interestingly, we observed that patients with 
hyperoxia had shorter HLOS and ICU-LOS, 
potentially attributed to the fact that patients of 
young age predominantly experienced episodes 
of hyperoxia. After propensity score matching, 
no differences were observed anymore. Further- 
more, other than expected, episodes of hyper- 
oxia predominantly occurred at low rather than 
high FiO2 settings. Our data therefore suggest 
that typical ICU patients at risk for hyperoxia 
burden might be young and less severe critically 
ill ICU patients receiving a lower FiO2. We 
believe that this ﬁnding is of clinical interest 
and needs to be taken into account when tailor- 
ing for individual optimal O2 values during 
IMV. In our opinion, further research investigat- 
ing the beneﬁcial or harmful effects of hyperoxia 
in ICU patients, especially with prolonged expo- 
sure, seems justiﬁed. Although some clinical 
data suggests that hyperoxia may relate to 
increased morbidity and mortality, the debate 
on the elusive promise of hyperoxia continues 
and further clariﬁcation is needed. 

Recent clinical evidence suggests that ICU staff 
is aware of the potentially harmful effects of 
prolonged hyperoxia.11,12 Nevertheless, O2 ther- 
apy still is not often adjusted to the individual 
ICU patient needs for various reasons. This 
includes technological difﬁculties of tailoring for 
individual O2 values but also missing consensus 
guidelines on optimal O2 targets.13–15 Despite, 
novel approaches for 
the implementation of 
more conservative rather than liberal O2 targets 
in ICU settings were published and appear fea- 
sible and easy to implement.16–19 One step fur- 
ther, Martin and Grocott et al. brought up the 
idea of permissive hypoxemia, meaning deliber- 
ately tailoring arterial oxygenation below nor- 
mally tolerated levels to avoid hyperoxia. Still, 
this novel concept needs clinical 
testing and 
lacks of solid evidence to improve ICU patient 
outcome.20,21 



One limitation of our single centre study is that 
the patient cohort investigated is rather small 
and therefore potentially underpowered. How- 
ever, we did only include ICU patients with 
IMV for at least 7 days. Similar to former stud- 
ies, we investigated a mixed anaesthesiological 
and surgical cohort that might bias our results. 
Also, we unfortunately did not investigate for 
the effects of hyperoxia on organ dysfunction as 
assessed by laboratory or clinical signs of organ 
injury. In the opinion of the authors it is of 
great clinical 
ICU patients with 
reduced oxidative reserve (e.g. sepsis, diabetes, 
old age) might be more susceptible to oxidative 
injury than younger and healthier ICU patients. 
The potentially harmful rather than beneﬁcial 
effects of hyperoxia are investigated in numer- 
ous running trials with different approaches 
(NCT02321072, NCT02713451, NCT02378545) 
showing the broad interest on this topic espe- 
cially in ICU patients with severe sepsis and 
acute respiratory failure. Another strong limita- 
tion of this study is the assumption that PaO2 
and FiO2 remained stable over time when calcu- 
lating for time-weighted mean PaO2 and FiO2 
values. However, performing more frequent 
repetitive daily ABG would be extremely time 
and personnel consuming and seems unrealistic 
to perform. Although this issue certainly repre- 
sents a study limitation, we believe that our 
approach seems valuable to approximate hyper- 
oxic burden and propose in accordance to 
Helmerhorst et al. that it should be used in fur- 
ther clinical studies.9 Finally, we acknowledge 
that our study has been retrospective in nature 
and results must be interpreted with caution. 
An initial inhomogeneity of the study sample 




was well treated by propensity score matching. 
After 
that, a representative, matched control 
group without hyperoxic burden was available 
and compensated in part for the retrospective 
character of the study. Demographic properties 
and existing comorbidities were taken into 
account and did not differ in the ﬁnally anal- 
ysed patient data. 
The quest on optimal O2 targets in periopera- 
tive and ICU settings is not over. Oxygen is 
regarded a drug with dose- and time-dependent 
side effects. This topic is of special interest for all 
anaesthesiologists and intensivists and should be 
followed up in future trials with a prospective 
study design to distinctly examine the inﬂuence 
of elevated oxygen levels on ventilated ICU 
patients. The importance of oxygen titration is 
also reﬂected in the recent WHO recommendation 
for perioperative high FiO2 during abdominal 
surgery to reduce surgical site infections,22 which 
is very controversially discussed. 

The present 
retrospective study investigated 
hyperoxia burden and associated in-hospital 
mortality in critically ill patients undergoing 
least 
invasive mechanical ventilation for at 
7 days. Results showed that highest mean PaO2 
values and highest PaO2 variability occurred on 
the ﬁrst day of mechanical ventilation. Continu- 
ous hyperoxia was observed in 18.1% of 
patients or nearly one-fourth of time during the 
whole observation period. Hyperoxia occurred 
especially at low to moderate FiO2 settings in 
younger patients with smaller SAPS2. After 
propensity score matching, hyperoxia was not 
associated with increased in-hospital mortality 
or ICU mortality. More evidence is needed to 
give clear advice on optimal individual O2 tar- 
gets in critically ill patients during IMV.
