Abstract 
Background: Oxygen saturation monitoring for children receiving respiratory support is standard worldwide. No ran- 
domised clinical trials have compared peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) targets for critically ill children. The harm of 
interventions to raise SpO2 to > 94% may exceed their benefits. 
Methods: We undertook an open, parallel-group randomised trial of children > 38 weeks completed gestation and 
< 16 years of age receiving invasive or non-invasive respiratory support and supplemental oxygen who were admitted 
urgently to one of three paediatric intensive care units. A ‘research without prior consent’ approach was employed. 
Children were randomly assigned to a liberal oxygenation group (SpO2 targets > 94%) or a conservative oxygenation 
 88–92% inclusive). Outcomes were measures of feasibility: recruitment rate, protocol adherence and 
group (SpO2 
acceptability, between-group separation of SpO2 and safety. The Oxy-PICU trial was registered before recruitment: 
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03040570. 

Results: A total of 159 children met the inclusion criteria, of whom 119 (75%) were randomised between April and 
July 2017, representing a rate of 10 patients per month per site. The mean time to randomisation from first contact 
with an intensive care team was 1.9 (SD 2.2) h. Consent to continue in the study was obtained in 107 cases (90%); 
the children’s parents/legal representatives were supportive of the consent process. The median (interquartile range, 
IQR) of time-weighted individual mean SpO2 was 94.9% (92.6–97.1) in the conservative oxygenation group and 97.5% 
(96.2–98.4) in the liberal group [difference 2.7%, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.3–4.0%, p < 0.001]. Median (IQR) 
time-weighted individual mean FiO2 was 0.28 (0.24–0.37) in the conservative group and 0.37 (0.30–0.42) in the liberal 
group (difference 0.08, 95% CI 0.03–0.13, p < 0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in length of 
stay, duration of organ support or mortality. Two prespecified serious adverse events (cardiac arrests) occurred, both 
in the liberal oxygenation group. 


Introduction 
A main aim of resuscitation and intensive care is to 
maintain appropriate and safe levels of tissue oxygena- 
tion [1–3]. However, as it is difficult to directly measure 
tissue oxygen, estimates of peripheral oxygen saturation 
(SpO2)and arterial partial pressure are typically substi- 
 
tuted. Invasive mechanical ventilation with supplemental 
oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation and partial pres- 
sure is the most common organ support provided in 
paediatric intensive care units (PICU). Around 70% of 
UK PICU admissions are invasively mechanically ven- 
tilated, amounting to 14–15,000 children annually [4]. 
Globally, the figure is unknown, but is in the hundreds 
of thousands. Despite these numbers, there is no high- 
quality evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) 
to inform the optimal level of oxygen saturation for criti- 
cally ill children receiving mechanical ventilation. 
Current practice relating to oxygen saturation targets 
varies widely in paediatric and adult intensive care units 
[5, 6]. Clinicians prevent severe hypoxia wherever possi- 
ble, but beyond this there is little consensus [7]. Indeed, a 
fear of hypoxia leads many to target supra-normal values. 
We previously described supra-physiological levels of 
oxygenation as the norm on PICU; around one-third of 
all recorded SpO2 values were 100% and more than 60% 
of values were over 95% [8]. 
Associations between high levels of arterial oxygena- 
tion and worse outcomes have been described post-car- 
diac arrest [9, 10], during extra-corporeal oxygenation 
for congenital heart disease [11], following stroke [12], 
and in respiratory failure [13]. When added to the known 
risks of severe hypoxia, a ‘U-shaped’ relationship between 
arterial oxygenation and risk of death emerges [3]. We 
observed an excess mortality (both crude and adjusted) 
at extremes of oxygenation in 7410 critically ill children 
[14]. A complex U-shaped relationship between oxygena- 
tion and outcome is biologically feasible and may arise 
from the balance between harm from hypoxic injury at 
one extreme and a combination of increased oxygen free 
radical damage and iatrogenic injury from more aggres- 
sive treatments at the other [15]. 
Clinical trials of oxygen targets in extremely premature 
infants have shown that they influence survival rates, 
retinopathy rates, and costs, with large RCTs compar- 
ing lower (85–89%) with higher SpO2 targets (91–95%) 
[16, 17]. Unexpectedly, an increased risk of death [rela- 
tive risk 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.15–1.84; 
p = 0.002] was observed with the lower SpO2 targets [17]. 
In contrast, in adult critical illness, small trials indicate a 
possible benefit of lower oxygenation targets [18, 19]. No 
benefit or significant harm with supplemental oxygen has 
been demonstrated in adults with ST elevation myocar- 
dial infarction [20–22]. 
The only paediatric trial data—in non-critically ill chil- 
dren with bronchiolitis—demonstrate equivalent safety 
of a SpO2 target of > 90% when compared to > 94%. Later 
hospital discharges were seen with the higher target 
(ratio of length of stay 1.28, 95% CI 1.09–1.50, p = 0.003) 
[23]. 
This pilot RCT was conducted to determine the safety 
and feasibility of a definitive multicentre RCT comparing 
current liberal targets for peripheral oxygen saturation 
with more conservative targets in critically ill children. 
The pilot RCT had the following objectives: (1) to test 
the willingness of clinicians to screen, recruit and ran- 
domise eligible patients; (2) to estimate the recruitment 
rate; (3) to test the acceptability of the deferred consent- 
ing procedures and participant information; (4) to test, 
following randomisation, delivery of and adherence to, 
the intervention and demonstrate separation between the 
groups; (5) to test follow-up for the identified, potential, 
patient-centred primary and other important secondary 
outcome measures and for adverse event reporting; (6) to 
inform final selection of a patient-centred primary out- 
come measure; and (7) to estimate the characteristics of 
the selected patient-centred primary outcome measure 
to inform sample size estimation. The underlying hypoth- 
esis is that the harm of interventions to raise peripheral 
oxygen saturation to > 94% exceeds the benefits of these 
interventions. 
Methods 
Study design and oversight 
Oxy-PICU was a pragmatic, open, multi-centre RCT in 
infants and children accepted for emergency admission 
to one of three participating PICUs. Three units were 
selected as representing typical configurations for UK 
PICUs (general or combined general and cardiac units in 
general academic medical centres or within stand-alone 
children’s hospitals). 
The trial was coordinated by the Intensive Care 
National Audit and Research Centre Clinical Trials 
Unit and sponsored by Great Ormond Street Hospital 
for Children NHS Foundation Trust. Health Research 
Authority (212228) and research ethics committee (16/ 
SC/0617) approval were obtained. The trial was regis- 
tered prior to recruitment of the first patient on Clinical- 
Trials.gov (NCT03040570) and the protocol published 
[24]. A trial steering committee, with a majority of inde- 
pendent members, and an independent data monitoring 
and ethics committee were convened to oversee the pilot 
trial on behalf of the sponsor. 




Inclusion criteria were: more than 38 weeks corrected 
gestational age and less than 16 years of age; within 
the first 6 h of face-to-face contact with PICU staff or 
transport team; an emergency admission accepted to a 
participating PICU requiring invasive or non-invasive 
respiratory support (including: invasive mechanical ven- 
tilation, non-invasive ventilation or high-flow humidified 
oxygen therapy), and receiving supplemental oxygen for 
abnormal gas exchange. 
Mechanical ventilation was considered to include inva- 
sive and non-invasive ventilation and high-flow humidi- 
fied oxygen. 
Exclusion criteria were: death perceived as imminent; 
brain pathology/injury as primary reason for admission 
(e.g. traumatic brain injury, post-cardiac arrest, stroke, 
convulsive status epilepticus); known pulmonary hyperten- 
sion; known or suspected sickle cell disease; known or sus- 
pected uncorrected congenital cardiac disease; end-of-life 
care plan in place with limitation of resuscitation; receiving 
long-term mechanical ventilation prior to this admission; 
or recruited to Oxy-PICU in a previous admission. 

Potentially eligible infants and children were screened 
against the inclusion/exclusion criteria by the transport 
team or PICU staff. Randomisation took place as soon 
as eligibility was confirmed including during transport. 
Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) via a secure 
web-based system to either the conservative (88–92%) or 
liberal (> 94%) peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) tar- 
get group by a computer-generated dynamic procedure 
(minimisation) with a random component (80% chance 
of allocation to the group that minimises imbalance). 
Minimisation was performed on: age (< 12 months vs. 
≥ 12 months); study site; primary reason for admission 
(lower respiratory tract infection vs. ‘other’); and severity 
of abnormality of gas exchange (saturation to fraction of 
inspired oxygen ratio < 221 with PEEP/CPAP > 5 cm H2O 
vs. other). 

Participants received supplemental oxygen and ventilator 
settings at the discretion of the treating clinical team with 
the aim of maintaining SpO2 > 94% in the liberal oxygena- 
tion group and between 88 and 92% (inclusive) in the 
conservative oxygen group until respiratory support was 
discontinued during the PICU admission. All other care 
was determined by the clinical team primarily responsi- 
ble for the participant’s care. Data on oxygenation param- 
eters and ventilator settings were recorded hourly from 
randomisation to 24 h, every 4 h from 24 to 120 h (day 6) 
and every 12 h from day 6 to the end of ventilation. 
We employed a ‘research without prior consent’ approach 
as is appropriate in emergency situations where any delay 
in commencing treatment allocation may be detrimental 
and when the treatments being compared are within the 
range of normal practice. A member of the research team 
approached the parents/legal representatives as soon 
as practical after randomisation to discuss the study, to 
provide a participant information sheet (Supplementary 
Material) and to seek consent for continued inclusion in 
the study. If the participant was discharged or died prior 
to their parents/legal representatives being approached, 
then they were approached by an appropriate team 
member at a later point either in person or by post with 
an option to opt out from the study at this point. The 
acceptability of this consent process was assessed with 
a 12-question multiple-choice questionnaire provided to 
parents/legal representatives following the approach for 
consent (Supplementary Material). 

As it was a pilot RCT, no formal sample size calcula- 
tions were performed, instead a sample size of 120 was 
determined to be adequate to estimate candidate patient- 
centred outcome measures to a necessary degree of pre- 
cision and to test the trial processes. 
The following outcome measures were used to assess 
the specified objectives. Objective 1: the proportion of 
eligible patients recruited (target 50%), and distribution 
of time to randomisation. Objective 2: the number of eli- 
gible patients recruited per month. Objective 3: the pro- 
portion of parents/legal representatives refusing deferred 
consent. Objective 4: total time in SpO2 target range and 
percentage of time in range, time-weighted mean SpO2, 
and time-weighted mean FiO2. Objectives 5–7: char- 
acteristics and completeness of potential primary end- 
points for a definitive study, including: length of PICU 
stay, length of invasive ventilation, ventilator-free days at 
day 30, duration of organ support, and PICU mortality; 
and observed serious adverse events. 
All analyses were carried out on an intention to treat 
basis. Continuous variables were summarised as mean 
(standard deviation) and median (interquartile range), 
while categorical variables were summarised as number 
(percentage). 
Results 
Between April and July 2017, 332 patients were screened 
and deemed to meet the inclusion criteria. Of these, 
170 patients met one or more of the exclusion criteria 
and a further 40 were deemed eligible but were not ran- 
domised. Overall, 122 were randomised to the pilot RCT 
(Fig. 1). Three patients were randomised in error. Two 
were immediately removed from the study before receiv- 
ing the intervention (one outside of age range, one ran- 
domised previously). One was removed from the study 
within hours after being recognised as meeting the ‘brain 
pathology as the main precipitant to admission’ exclusion 
criterion. Therefore, 74.8% (119/159) of eligible patients 
were appropriately randomised at a recruitment rate of 
10 patients per month per site. Time to randomisation 

a Three patients were withdrawn following randomisation in error: one was out of age range, one had previously 
been recruited to the study and one met the brain pathology/injury exclusion criterion. 
b Unable to seek consent in three cases: two children were subject to child protection care orders and one for 
whom no suitable translator was available for the family.

line characteristics were balanced between the arms

subsequently declined in 9/119 patients (7.6%). Eight of 
these cases were at a single study site. Three further cases 
(3/119, 2.5%) did not continue in the study because we 
were unable to seek consent (a suitable translator was 
not available for one family and two children were sub- 
ject to care orders). Forty-four (44/116 38%) completed 
consent questionnaires were returned, 40/44 (91%) 
reported being satisfied with the consent process, while 
the remainder (4/44, 9%) were neither satisfied nor dis- 
satisfied (Table 2). Full survey results including free text 
comments are available in the supplementary material 
(Tables S2 and S3). A total of 107 out of the 119 (89.9%) 
correctly randomised patients were therefore analysed to 
evaluate objectives 4–7. 
The median (IQR) of time-weighted individual mean 
SpO2 was 94.9% (92.6–97.1) in the conservative group 
and 97.5% (96.2–98.4) in the liberal group (difference in 
medians of 2.7, 95% CI 1.3–4.0%, p < 0.001) for the full 
duration of mechanical ventilation. Values for the first 
24 h were similar: conservative 94.7% (93–97) versus lib- 
eral 97.4% (96.3–98.2), (difference 2.8, 95% CI 1.5–4.0, 
p < 0.001) (Fig. 2). The median (IQR) time-weighted 
individual FiO2 was 0.28 (0.24–0.37) in the conservative 
group and 0.37 (0.30–0.42) in the liberal group (differ- 
ence 0.08, 95% CI 0.03–0.13, p < 0.001) for the full dura- 
tion of mechanical ventilation. The median (IQR) FiO2 
values in the first 24 h were slightly higher: conservative 
0.29 (0.25–0.37) and liberal 0.40 (0.31–0.5), (difference 
0.11, 95% CI 0.05–0.17, p < 0.001). 
 
Of all recorded FiO2 values, 36.4% (804/2210) were 0.21 
in the conservative group compared to 13.0% (306/2347) 
in the liberal group (Chi-squared p < 0.001). In the first

recent findings in the Fluids in Shock study [25]. The vari- 
ability in consent rates by institution will inform our site 
training for approaching families in a larger study. 
Candidate patient-centred outcomes had high com- 
pletion rates and were similar between groups. Detailed 
characteristics are provided in Table 3. Two pre-specified 
serious adverse events (cardiac arrests) occurred, both in 
the liberal oxygenation group. 
Discussion 
In this multiple centre, parallel-group, pilot RCT, we 
investigated the feasibility of conducting a large-scale 
trial comparing conservative oxygenation (SpO2 88–92%) 
with liberal oxygenation (SpO2 > 94%) in critically ill chil- 
dren receiving respiratory support. 
We observed that the eligibility criteria were effective 
in identifying patients and that clinicians were prepared 
to randomise these patients. Our initial estimates of the 
number of emergency admissions who met these cri- 
teria were shown to be very conservative, with recruit- 
ment being completed in approximately two-thirds of 
the planned study time. Indeed, our study may have 
further underestimated the true potential recruitment 
rate because the study period did not include any win- 
ter months during which admissions in acute respiratory 
failure predominate. The randomisation processes were 
timely and effective with short intervals between first con- 
tact and randomisation. The high rates of recruitment of 
eligible patients and low rates of consent being declined 
are comparable with other emergency studies in criti- 
cally ill children. Families’ feedback of the consent process 
was both overwhelmingly supportive and in line with our 
The protocol achieved separation of the groups in 
terms of SpO2 and FiO2 values. Our SpO2 values were 
almost identical both in values and separations to those 
achieved in the CLOSE study reported by the ANZIC 
group in critically ill adults [18]. However, adherence 
to the oxygenation target range was poor in the con- 
servative group. This was especially clear in the first few 
hours after randomisation. This may reflect the lack of 
an option to reduce FiO2 below 0.4 on many paediatric 
transport ventilators. In addition, many children clini- 
cally improved rapidly so that an SpO2 goal of 88–92% 
was not achievable because they were already breathing 
air. It may also be true that some bedside staff preferred 
values of 100% based on previous usual practice, espe- 
cially during episodes of chest physiotherapy or other 
procedures. The pre-randomisation baseline SpO2 values 
of 99% reinforce the extent to which normal practice is 
for very liberal SpO2 values. 
Further work with high-resolution (q5 s) analysis of 
SpO2 data is in progress to understand this behaviour, 
with a view to further refining the protocol. A higher 
baseline threshold FiO2 for inclusion (e.g. > 0.50) and 
a recommendation for setting an upper SpO2 alarm 
limit are simple protocol refinements that may further 
improve adherence without a major impact on the other 
trial processes. 
Since this study was planned, a number of trials of oxy- 
genation strategies in adults have reported or opened 
for recruitment. The HYPER2S trial in adults with septic

shock employed a factorial design comparing an FiO2 
1.0 with an SpO2 target of 88–95% alongside hypertonic 
versus isotonic volume resuscitation. It was stopped 
prematurely for safety concerns of increased weakness 
and atelectasis in the hyperoxia group with a trend to 
increased mortality [26]. The single-centre Oxygen- 
ICU study observed reduced mortality with modestly 
reduced oxygenation targets (SpO2 94–98 vs. 97–100%) 
[19]. A number of larger studies are currently recruit- 
ing, including: evaluating the effects of two approaches 
to oxygen therapy in intensive care unit patients requir- 
ing life support (ICU-ROx), ACTRN 12615000957594 
by the ANZICS group, and handling oxygenation tar- 
gets in the intensive care unit (HOT-ICU) in Denmark, 
NCT03174002; optimal oxygenation in the intensive 
care unit (O2-ICU) in the Netherlands, NCT02321072; 
Liberal Oxygenation Versus Conservative Oxygena- 
tion in ARDS (LOCO2) in France NCT02713451 and 
Targeted Oxygen therapy in Critical illness (TOXYC) 
NCT03287466 in the UK. Maitland and colleagues are 
conducting a large study of oxygen treatment thresholds 
combined with a comparison of high flow versus low flow 
oxygen delivery in east Africa, ISRCTN15622505 [27]. 
Our study shares a number of weaknesses with the 
majority of these trials. Exclusion of cases with acute 
encephalopathy or congenital cardiac disease limits the 
generalisability of any findings to a subset of critically ill 
children. These were felt to be necessary because of our 
work scoping current practice and equipoise [7]. We did 
not attempt to control oxygen therapy prior to PICU

referral. We did not attempt to blind clinical staff to the 
group allocation. Our pragmatic approach means that cli- 
nicians were free to adopt different haemodynamic goals, 
temperature control strategies or transfusion thresholds 
that might alter the balance between oxygen delivery and 
consumption independent of the SpO2 targets. These 
multiple interactions may only be tractable with more 
complex adaptive trial designs [28]. In addition, as a fea- 
sibility study, we cannot make any conclusions on the 
effectiveness of conservative oxygenation. 
There are also several strengths of Oxy-PICU beyond 
it being the first report of a randomised comparison of 
conservative and liberal oxygenation strategies in criti- 
cally ill children. We have demonstrated a high degree of 
engagement of clinical staff with the protocol across dif- 
ferent units and transport teams. The trial processes were 
acceptable to parents/legal representatives. No safety 
issues were identified and there were trends across the 
clinical outcomes for shorter durations of organ support 
in the conservative group that might be suitable as out- 
come measures in a full trial. 
Although the choice of primary outcome measure for a 
definitive trial will involve consultation with patients and 
families and considerations of cost, timings and compet- 
ing studies, our data permit sample size estimations. For 
example, a ‘ventilator-free days’ outcome with 90% power 
to detect a 1.25-day difference in ventilation and no effect 
on mortality would require a total of 2014 patients. These 
pilot data support the feasibility of a trial on this scale in 
critically-ill children. 
Conclusion 
This Oxy-PICU study has demonstrated that it is feasible 
to conduct a large pragmatic clinical trial of conserva- 
tive versus liberal oxygenation in critically ill children. 
Considerations for a full trial include addition of an FiO2 
threshold for inclusion, and a recommendation for an 
upper SpO2 alarm limit in the conservative group.
