Purpose: Arterial hyperoxia after resuscitation has been associated with increased mortality in adults. 
The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that post-resuscitation hyperoxia and hypocapnia are 
associated with increased mortality after resuscitation in pediatric patients. 
Methods: We performed a prospective observational multicenter hospital-based study including 223 
children aged between 1 month and 18 years who achieved return of spontaneous circulation after 
in-hospital cardiac arrest and for whom arterial blood gas analysis data were available. 
Results: After return of spontaneous circulation, 8.5% of patients had hyperoxia 
(deﬁned as 
PaO2 > 300 mmHg) and 26.5% hypoxia (deﬁned as PaO2 < 60 mmHg). No statistical differences in mortal- 
ity were observed when patients with hyperoxia (52.6%), hypoxia (42.4%), or normoxia (40.7%) (p = 0.61). 
Hypocapnia (deﬁned as PaCO2 < 30 mmHg) was observed in 13.5% of patients and hypercapnia (deﬁned as 
PaCO2 > 50 mmHg) in 27.6%. Patients with hypercapnia or hypocapnia had signiﬁcantly higher mortality 
(59.0% and 50.0%, respectively) than patients with normocapnia (33.1%) (p = 0.002). At 24 h after return of 
spontaneous circulation, neither PaO2 nor PaCO2 values were associated with mortality. Multiple logis- 
tic regression analysis showed that hypercapnia (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.62–6.61; p = 0.001) and hypocapnia 
(OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.04–7.05; p = 0.04) after return of spontaneous circulation were signiﬁcant mortality 
factors. 
Conclusions: In children resuscitated from cardiac arrest, hyperoxemia after return of spontaneous circu- 
lation or 24 h later was not associated with mortality. On the other hand, hypercapnia and hypocapnia 
were associated with higher mortality than normocapnia. 


stabilisation interventions after initially successful resuscitation 
must be improved in order to reverse post-CA syndrome. 
Current rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) 
in-hospital cardiac arrest (CA) range from 50% to 73%; 
after 
however, ﬁnal survival is signiﬁcantly lower.1–7 Consequently, 
Post-CA syndrome is the result of the prolonged period of 
systemic ischaemia during CA and the subsequent reperfusion 
response that occurs after resuscitation and ROSC.8,9

Previous studies in animals have shown that excessive oxygen 
during the reperfusion period increases neuronal damage through 
production of free radicals and mitochondrial injury.10 Once ROSC 
is achieved, ventilation with the minimum fraction of inspired oxy- 
gen (FiO2) required to maintain adequate oxygen saturation of 
arterial blood (around 94%) may facilitate survival and favourable 
neurological outcome.11–16 Several clinical studies of adult patients 
admitted to the intensive care unit after CA have analysed the 
 
 
 


inﬂuence of arterial hyperoxia on mortality and suggest that it 
signiﬁcantly increases the mortality.17–19 However, data on the 
potential inﬂuence of hyperoxia on the outcome of CA and resusci- 
tation in children are lacking. 
Conversely, hyperventilation is thought to worsen outcome 
after ROSC, because it diminishes cerebral blood ﬂow and increases 
brain ischaemia20–22; nevertheless, no clinical data have been 
published regarding the eventual inﬂuence of hypocapnia or hyper- 
capnia on survival after CA. 
We describe the incidence of hyperoxia, hypocapnia, and hyper- 
capnia after ROSC and the outcome of children who suffered 
in-hospital CA. Our main objective was to test the hypothesis that 
hyperoxia and hypocapnia after ROSC are associated with increased 
mortality in paediatric in-hospital CA. 

The study population comprised patients from an ongoing mul- 
ticentre study aged 1 month to 18 years who suffered in-hospital CA 
and achieved ROSC between December 2007 and 2009. The inclu- 
sion criterion was to have had at least an arterial blood gas analysis 
performed at ROSC and 24 h after CA. The study was approved 
by the local institutional review boards. CA was deﬁned as the 
absence of a palpable central pulse, unresponsiveness, apnoea and 
severe bradycardia of less than 60 bpm with poor perfusion in 
infants requiring external cardiac compression and assisted ven- 
tilation. 
The case report form included the following: patient-related 
variables (age, sex and weight), cause of CA, personal background 
characteristics of CA and resuscitation (type of CA, variables moni- 
tored, assisted ventilation or vasoactive drugs administered before 
the CA and staff who performed the resuscitation manoeuvres and 
procedures), ﬁrst recorded electrocardiogram (ECG) rhythm, total 
duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and ﬁrst arte- 
rial blood gas analysis immediately after ROSC and 24 h after. The 
outcome-related variable was clinical status at hospital discharge 
(alive or dead). 
Statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Pack- 
age for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 15.0.1 (SPSS 
Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous data are presented as either 
mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range 
as appropriate, based on the distribution of data; categorical 
data are reported as proportions and 95% conﬁdence intervals 
(CIs). 
For the purposes of this analysis, the cohort was divided into 
three exposure groups deﬁned a priori based on PaO2 in the ﬁrst 
arterial blood gas values obtained. Hyperoxia was deﬁned as a PaO2 
of 300 mmHg or greater (or a ratio of PaO2 to FiO2 (PaO2/FiO2) 
>300); hypoxia was deﬁned as a PaO2 of less than 60 mmHg or a 
PaO2/FiO2 <200. 


The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality, which 
was compared between groups using the chi-squared test; the Bon- 
ferroni correction was applied when groups were compared in 
pairs. 
A 
 scheduled secondary analysis of the results was performed in 
order to detect patients at risk of hyperoxia, who might have been 
undervalued using the limits presented above. For this purpose, a 
lower PaO2 cut-off was considered to deﬁne hyperoxia: 200 mmHg 
rather than 300 mmHg in a ﬁrst approximation, and 100 mmHg 
rather than 200 mmHg in a ﬁnal step. 
analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. The results are 
expressed as odds ratio and 95% CIs. A p value <0.05 was considered 
signiﬁcant. 

Of a total of 543 in-hospital CA episodes registered, 386 (71%) 
achieved ROSC. The study sample comprised the 223 patients 
in whom arterial blood gas data after ROSC were available. The 
baseline characteristics of patients are described in Table 1. We 
found that 46.5% of patients were younger than 1 year and 59% 
weighed less than 10 kg. CA occurred in the paediatric intensive 
care unit in 64% of cases. Out of the 223 patients, 19 were clas- 
siﬁed as hyperoxic (8.5%) and 59 as hypoxic (26.5%) (Table 1 and 
Fig. 1). Arterial blood gases were also recorded 24 h after CA in 173 
patients. 
In-hospital mortality was 40%. Patients with hyperoxia imme- 
diately after ROSC (PaO2 criteria) had higher mortality (52.6%) 
than patients with hypoxia (42.4%) and than those with normoxia 
(40.7%), although the differences were not statistically signiﬁcant 
(p = 0.61). 
No signiﬁcant differences in mortality were observed (PaO2 cri- 
teria) in the arterial blood gas analysis 24 h after CA – hyperoxia 
33%, hypoxia 29.8% and normoxia 35.8% – although there were only 
three patients in the hyperoxia group (Table 2). 
In the secondary analysis, using a PaO2 > 200 mmHg as the 
hyperoxia limit, no signiﬁcant differences were recorded in mor- 
tality between patients with hyperoxia immediately after ROSC 
(39%), those with hypoxia (42.4%) and those with normoxia (43.1%) 
(p = 0.9). Likewise, although patients with hyperoxia 24 h after CA 
had higher mortality rates (57.1%) than those with hypoxia (31.6%) 
or normoxia (35.3%), the differences did not reach statistical signif- 
icance (p = 0.16). 
The results for mortality were similar when the hyperoxia limit 
was placed at 100 mmHg: hyperoxia 41.8%, hypoxia 42.4% and nor- 
moxia 42.4% (p = 0.99). 
In 203 of the 223 patients, FiO2 was registered simultaneously 
with the arterial blood gas analysis when performed immediately 
after ROSC, and in 152 when performed 24 h later. When groups 
were compared according to PaO2/FiO2 criteria, patients with a 
ratio above 300 had higher mortality (51.2%) than those with ratios 
between 200 and 300 (32%) or below 200 (42.2%); however, once 
again, the differences did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (p = 0.29) 
(Table 2). 
Considering the results 24 h after the CA assay, the PaO2/FiO2 
hypoxia group had higher mortality (41.8%) than the hyperoxia 
group (24.2%) and the normoxia group (28.6%), although the dif- 
ference was not signiﬁcant (p = 0.14) (Table 2). 
Arterial CO2 measurements were available immediately and 
24 h after ROSC for 221 and 152 patients, respectively. Patients with 
arterial hypercapnia or hypocapnia immediately after ROSC had 
signiﬁcantly higher mortality than patients with normal arterial 
CO2 values (p = 0.002). 
No statistically signiﬁcant differences in mortality were found 
between patients with hypercapnia and patients with hypocapnia 
(59.0% vs. 50.0%; p = 1) or between those with hypocapnia and those 
with normocapnia (50.0% vs. 33.1%; p = 0.371). However, mortal- 
ity was signiﬁcantly higher in the hypercapnia group than in the 
normocapnia group (59.0% vs. 33.1%; p = 0.003). 
In the assay 24 h after CA, the hypocapnia group had higher mor- 
tality rates (44.4%) than the normocapnia group (33.1%), although 
the differences were not signiﬁcant (p = 0.37) (Table 3). 
Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the 
potential inﬂuence of each of the factors on mortality. All the 
individual factors with statistical signiﬁcance in the univariate 
The mortality of patients who presented hypercapnia and 
hypoxia immediately after ROSC was 47.8% in comparison with the 
rest of patients 36.8% (p = 0.29).

After adjusting for other factors in the multivariate analysis, 
both hypercapnia and hypocapnia immediately after ROSC were 
associated with mortality (Table 4). 
Neither hyperoxia nor hypoxia was found to be a signiﬁcant pre- 
dictor of in-hospital mortality; when entered in the multivariate 
model, they did not modify the regression coefﬁcient. 
In contrast, other risk factors that proved to be signiﬁcantly 
associated with a lower in-hospital death rate in multivariate logis- 
tic regression analysis were respiratory illness as cause of CA and 
initial shockable rhythm. 

Resuscitation from CA does not end after ROSC. Post-ROSC care 
has signiﬁcant potential to prevent the early mortality caused 
by haemodynamic instability and further injury at the cellular 
level. The objectives of resuscitation include optimisation of car- 
diopulmonary function and systemic perfusion, identiﬁcation of 
the precipitating causes of the arrest, institution of measures to pre- 
vent recurrence of CA and administration of therapies that might 
facilitate long-term survival. 



Arterial blood gas analysis performed immediately after ROSC 
revealed considerable variation in oxygenation, even if parameters 
were extended to PaO2 values of 200 and 100 mmHg.Post-ROSC 
exposure to hyperoxia amongst our paediatric cohort was an 
uncommon occurrence. Aetiology of in-hospital CA in our popu- 
lation was mostly due to respiratory, which could partly justify the 
fact that hyperoxia was barely detected and lower than in adult 
studies.17–19 
Most patients were normoxaemic 24 h after CA; moreover, anal- 
ysis of PaO2/FiO2 ratios showed that, at the time, most patients 
needed high FiO2 administration to reach normal PaO2 values, 
thus implying some kind of underlying pulmonary damage or an

alteration of the ventilation to perfusion relationship. Pulmonary 
circulatory dysfunction can induce low arterial oxygen saturation 
after ROSC. However, PaO2/FiO2 ratio values had no statistically 
signiﬁcant impact on survival immediately after ROSC or 24 h later. 
A 
 decrease in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 24 h showed a trend towards 
increased mortality rates, although this difference did not achieve 
statistical signiﬁcance. 
Post-CA syndrome 
that 




compromises 
comprises 
potential brain 
injury, myocardial dysfunction and systemic 
ischaemia/reperfusion response.8,9 Thus, after ROSC, goal-directed 
interventions are required in order to improve outcome. Variations 
in oxygenation and ventilation during CPR and after ROSC may 
trigger the cascade of events that contributes to tissue re-perfusion 
damage.8,9 Oxidative stress is believed to result from a surge of 
reactive oxygen species, which could be favoured by a persistently 
hyperoxic environment.10–15 Kilgannon et al.17,19 found that, in an 
adult in-hospital CA sample, mortality was signiﬁcantly higher in 
patients with hyperoxia after resuscitation. However, in contrast 
with our ﬁndings, most patients in that study were hypoxic, and 
no data were reported on the temporal relationship between blood 
gas analysis and ROSC.17,19 Our results suggest that, in children, 
even after conducting CPR with 100% oxygen, the incidence of 
hyperoxia immediately after ROSC is low and becomes very rare 
24 h after CA. These results are consistent with those of Bellomo 
et al.,18 whose study of adults who had suffered non-traumatic 
CA showed hyperoxia as a rare event, occurring in 10.6% of their 
sample.

the hyperoxia 
in 
On the other hand, Bellomo et al.18 did not observe a robust 
relationship between hyperoxia and mortality with the 300 or 
400 mmHg limits. PaO2 values did not remain associated with hos- 
pital mortality when the data were adjusted for relevant covariates 
such as concomitant illnesses and Acute Physiology and Chronic 
Health Evaluation (APACHE) scores. 
In our study, arterial hyperoxia following CA was not associ- 
ated with increased hospital mortality in children; furthermore, 
after adjustments for covariates, neither PaO2 values nor PaO2/FiO2 
ratios inﬂuenced the odds ratio for mortality. 
We found that paediatric patients were more likely to be nor- 
moxic after ROSC and remain as such during the ﬁrst 24 h after CA. 
This ﬁnding contrasts with the observations in adults made by Kil- 
gannon et al.17 and Bellomo et al.,18 who found that 73.5% and 63% 
of patients, respectively, were hypoxaemic at the time. 
Paediatric CA aetiology is different from adult CA. It is known 
that after acute coronary syndrome or acute myocardial infarction, 
hyperoxia causes coronary vasoconstriction, decreased myocardial 
blood ﬂow and decreased myocardial oxygen consumption.11,12 
Therefore, the co-morbidity of acute coronary syndrome could be a 


mechanism by which post-CA hyperoxia could worsen survival in 
adults when compared to children. 

Studies in pigs demonstrated that excessive ventilation rates 
signiﬁcantly decreased coronary perfusion pressures and survival 
rates when CPR was conducted after inducing ventricular ﬁbril- 
lation in an adult CA model.20–22 Increased ventilation rates and 
increased duration of ventilation are believed to impede venous 
blood return to the heart, thus decreasing coronary perfusion pres- 
sure during CPR. Furthermore, a direct and immediate transfer of 
the increase in intra-thoracic pressure to the cranial cavity with 
positive pressure ventilation reduces cerebral perfusion pressure. 
However, the results of these CA adult model studies should be 
interpreted with caution, as they focus on the inﬂuence of venti- 
lation on the interruption of chest compression rather than on the 
impact of ventilation status according to arterial CO2 values. 
As shown in our sample, respiratory illnesses are one of the main 
causes of CA in children. Given the high incidence of underlying res- 
piratory diseases and respiratory arrest before CA, children might 
develop hypercapnia more frequently than adults. This could also 
explain, at least in part, the low incidence of hypocapnia immedi- 
ately after ROSC in our sample. 
Recently published studies based on a paediatric animal model 
of CA with asphyxia also found the incidence of hypocapnia to be 
very low. Moreover, the animals barely achieved normal ventilation 
parameters and presented hypercapnia despite being ventilated at 
rates higher than those recommended by guidelines.23–27 
Therefore, the optimal ventilation rate for resuscitation of CA 
and after ROSC in paediatric patients has yet to be deﬁned.27 Our 
study, which is the ﬁrst to assess PaCO2 values after ROSC in 
children, suggests that ventilation following current International 
Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) guidelines generally 
results in normocarbia or hypercapnia. It is noteworthy that exces- 
sive ventilation is a rare event in paediatric resuscitation (detected 
in <15% of our patients). 
Children with normocapnia showed lower mortality than those 
with hypercapnia or hypocapnia in the univariate analysis. Fur- 
thermore, after adjusting for other signiﬁcant variables in the 
multiple logistic regression analysis, hypocapnia and hypercapnia 
were associated with higher mortality. 
Patients with hypoxia and hypercapnia presented non- 
signiﬁcant higher mortality than the rest of patients, although only 
23 patients presented hypoxia and hypercapnia. 
On the other hand our data showed that patients with CA sec- 
ondary to respiratory illness and initial deﬁbrillation rhythms have 
better survival. These factors have been previously described in 
other studies.1–7 
Our study has several limitations. First, it is an observational 
study with no planned intervention; therefore, no causal relation- 
ship could be inferred from the results. Second, the exact limits 
for deﬁning excessive oxygen exposure are unknown; based on 
previous studies, we deﬁned hyperoxia as a PaO2 of 300 mmHg 
or greater,17–19 and, although other PaO2 values were considered 
in the secondary analysis, their possible inﬂuence on our results 
remains uncertain. Third, the number of children with hyperoxia 
was low, a ﬁnding that could account for the absence of signiﬁ- 
cant differences in outcome. In addition, measurement of arterial 
blood gases cannot be considered a reliable marker of interstitial 
or cellular oxygen tension. Further studies are needed to determine 
the extent of tissue and cellular hypoxia and the associated oxygen 
requirements during and after resuscitation. 
Although characteristics of our patients, including prior heart 
disease, were taken into consideration, those with congenital intra- 
cardiac shunt were not stratiﬁed, and this could have biased 
our results. The inﬂuence of temperature was not taken into 
consideration either, as hypothermia was an uncommon practice 
in paediatric post-ROSC care during the recruitment period and 
therapeutic hypothermia was not intended in most of our patients. 
Another noteworthy limitation is that long-term outcome has 
not yet been assessed. We acknowledge that hyperoxia could be 
associated with brain injury and neurological impairment, as well 
as with extracerebral deleterious consequences not analysed in our 
study. 

Most children who suffer in-hospital CA, although resuscitated 
with 100% FiO2, are not exposed to arterial hyperoxia immediately 
after ROSC or 24 h later. Arterial hyperoxia at these time points was 
not associated with mortality in children. Ventilation during CPR 
and after ROSC achieves normal PaCO2 values in most paediatric 
patients. Hypercapnia after ROSC is more frequent than hypocapnia 
and both could be associated with higher mortality. 
Although targeting normal PaO2 and PaCO2 could be important 
for preventing further damage by post-CA syndrome in children, 
deﬁnitive clinical trials are needed to determine the impact of these 
strategies on survival and outcome in children who suffer CA.
