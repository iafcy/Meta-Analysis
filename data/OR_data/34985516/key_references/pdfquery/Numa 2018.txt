Objectives: To determine whether the association between hyper- 
oxia and increased risk-adjusted mortality in adult intensive care 
patients is also observed in a pediatric intensive care population. 
Design: Single-center retrospective analysis of admissions to ICU 
over a 5-year period commencing January 1, 2012, examining the 
2 measured within the first hour of admis- 
relationship between Pao 
sion and risk-adjusted mortality. Standardized mortality rates were 
calculated using the Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and patients 
2 bands to assess 
were grouped into 50 mm Hg (6.67 kPa) Pao 
the relationship between initial Pao 
Setting: Tertiary PICU with 17 beds and 1,100 annual admissions 
located in metropolitan Sydney, Australia.

Patients: A total of 1,447 patients 0–18 years old with Pao 
recorded at admission to the ICU. 
Interventions: None. 
Measurements and Main Results: There were 5,176 patients 
admitted to the ICU during the study period and 1,447 (28%) with 
2 recorded at admission. A U-shaped relationship between raw 
Pao 
2 was observed, with lowest mortality 
mortality and admission Pao 
(2.3% and 2.6%, respectively) observed in the 101–150 (13.5– 
20.0 kPa) and 151–200 mm Hg (20.1–26.7 kPa) bands and the 
2 less than 50 mm 
highest mortality observed in patients with Pao 
Hg (6.67 kPa) with mortality of 5.3%, or greater than 350 mm Hg 
(46.7 kPa) with mortality of 18.2%. Hyperoxia at admission was 
associated with an increase in risk-adjusted mortality, with poly-

band and risk-adjusted outcome (r2 = 0.845). When included in a 
multivariate model that included the Pediatric Index of Mortality-3 
variables, the odds ratio for hyperoxia (defined as Pao 
2 > 250 mm 
Hg [33.3 kPa]) predicting death was 2.66 (p = 0.047). 
Conclusions: In this single-center study, hyperoxia at admission to 
the PICU was highly correlated with increased risk-adjusted mortal- 
ity. Further investigation of these observations in a large multicenter 
cohort is warranted. (Pediatr Crit Care Med 2018; 19:699–704)

ders was first proposed by Priestly (1) in the late 18th 
century, and increasingly applied following Haldane's 
landmark paper published in 1917 (2). Haldane (2) recognized 
the potential for harm from this newly described therapy and 
went so far as to define a median lethal dose (LD50) of 12 weeks 
exposure to 70% inspired oxygen in laboratory mice. Despite 
the prescient warnings by Haldane (2), oxygen began to be 
used liberally for a wide variety of respiratory and nonrespira- 
tory disorders. Concerns regarding toxicity began to emerge in 
the latter half of the 20th century. Prolonged exposure to high 
concentrations of oxygen was recognized as a causative factor 
for retinopathy of prematurity in 1952 (3), and in 1967, Nash 
et al (4) were the first to describe “respirator lung” in adults, 
which was postulated to be related to high inspired oxygen 
concentrations (although was probably a combination of oxy- 
gen and pressure-/volume-related injury). Bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia in neonates was reported contemporaneously (5). 
Risks associated with the administration of supplemental 
oxygen have more recently been recognized in specific patient 
populations. Hyperoxia has been associated with increased 
mortality following cardiac arrest (6–10) and increased early 
myocardial injury and infarct size following acute myocar- 
dial infarction (11) although several other large trials failed to 
demonstrate any deleterious effects (12, 13). Laboratory stud- 
ies indicate proinflammatory and cytotoxic effects of hyper- 
oxia on human cardiac myocytes (14). Hyperoxia has also

been linked to either worse outcomes or increased mortality 
risk in retrospective studies of adult patients with trauma (15), 
traumatic brain injury (16, 17), and stroke (18). In pediatric 
subjects, a number of studies have indicated worse outcomes 
following cardiac arrest (10, 19) and in patients requiring 
extracorporeal support after cardiac surgery (20). 


A number of recent studies in adult populations have dem- 
onstrated an association between hyperoxia and mortality in 
general intensive care populations. In a large retrospective study 
of 36,307 ventilated patients in 50 Dutch ICUs, de Jonge et al 
2 in the 
(21) demonstrated a U-shaped relationship between Pao 
2 from the blood gas with the 
first 24 hours (defined as the Pao 
2 in that period) and mortality, an association 
worst Pao 
that remained significant after correction for illness severity 
(Simplified Acute Physiology Score [SAPS] II) and demographic 
variables. The lowest standardized mortality rate (SMR) was 
2 in the range of 8.9–10.6 kPa 
observed in patients with a Pao 
(65–80 mm Hg), with values below and above this range associ- 
ated with higher SMRs. de Jonge et al (21) also demonstrated a 
2 and hospital mortality—with 
linear relationship between Fio 
2 in the first 24 hours of admission associated with 
higher Fio 
2 and SAPS II 
increased mortality (after adjustment for Pao 
score)—thus suggesting a relationship between mortality and 
both the concentration of oxygen administered to the patient

and the Pao 
2 and 
(22) failed to demonstrate any relationship between Pao 
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) 
III risk-adjusted mortality (although a U-shaped curve was 
observed in both unadjusted data and SAPS II risk-adjusted 
data). An interesting observation from this study was the high 
prevalence of hyperoxia, with 49.8% of patients having at least 
2 greater than 120 mm Hg (16.0 kPa) in the first 24 hours 
one Pao 
of ICU care. Both Eastwood et al (22) and de Jonge et al (21) 
2 in the first 
focussed largely on a single measurement of Pao 
2 
2/Fio 
24 hours of ICU admission (at the time of the worst Pao 
result). Cumulative exposure to oxygen over the course of an 
ICU admission has also been examined. Helmerhorst et al (23) 
analyzed 295,079 arterial blood gases in 14,441 ICU patients in 
three tertiary ICUs in the Netherlands, using interpolation to 
calculate an area under the curve representing total exposure 
to hyperoxia over the first 24 and 96 hours of ICU stay as well 
as the total duration of the ICU admission. Both duration of 
2 120–200 mm Hg 
exposure to mild hyperoxia (defined as Pao 
2 > 200 mm Hg 
[16.0–26.7 kPa]) and severe hyperoxia (Pao 
[26.7 kPa]) demonstrated a linear relationship with APACHE 
IV risk-adjusted mortality. Helmerhorst et al (23) also exam- 
2 and risk- 
ined the relationship between first recorded Pao 
adjusted mortality in this cohort, demonstrating a U-shaped 
relationship similar to the findings by de Jonge et al (21). 
Although an increasing body of evidence points to delete- 
rious effects of hyperoxia in specific diagnostic subgroups in 
both adults and children, as well as general adult ICU popula- 
tions, no studies in mixed PICU patients have been reported. 
This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship 
2 and standardized mortality risk in patients 
between initial Pao 
admitted to PICU. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The study was undertaken in the ICU at Sydney Children’s 
Hospital, a 17-bed tertiary referral mixed medical and surgical 
ICU located in metropolitan Sydney admitting approximately 
1,100 patients per annum. Approval to conduct the study was 
obtained from the local research ethics committee. 
All admissions between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 
2017, were eligible for inclusion and complete admission, and out- 
come data were available for all patients. Pao 
2 obtained within 1 
hour of admission is routinely recorded for the Pediatric Index of 
Mortality (PIM) calculation. For the purposes of this study, “admis- 
sion Pao 
2” was defined as the first value recorded within the first 60 
minutes of admission to the ICU. All patients with an admission 
Pao 
2 value recorded were included in the study. The commence- 
ment date of January 1, 2012, was chosen as data recording for the 
most recent version of PIM (version 3 [24]) commenced at this 
time, allowing examination of initial Pao 
2 as a potential PIM vari- 
able. Patients were a priori assigned to groups delineated by 50 mm 
Hg (6.67 kPa) Pao 
2 increments (i.e., 1–50 mm Hg, 51–100 mm 
Hg, 101–150 mm Hg, and so on). Mortality was defined as death 
occurring in the ICU or within 24 hours of discharge as per PIM-3. 
2 and mortality was examined 
using polynomial regression, and the impact of hyperoxia as 
a potential PIM variable was analyzed using multiple logistic 
regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. 
Data were analyzed using Wizard Statistics (version 1.9.13, 
Evan Miller) and GraphPad Prism (version 7.0; GraphPad 
Software, La Jolla, CA). Binomial proportions were compared 
by chi-square testing, and standardized mortality was analyzed 
using a Poisson distribution (25). Nonparametric data were 
compared using the Mann-Whitney test. 

RESULTS 
There were 5,176 patients admitted to the ICU during the 
study period, with an observed mortality of 126 (2.4%) and a 
PIM-3–predicted mortality of 141.54 (SMR, 0.890; p = 0.10). 
Median age was 1.7 years (interquartile range [IQR], 0.3–7.1 
yr). A total of 1,447 patients (28% of all patients) had Pao 
2 
recorded at admission to the ICU. Observed mortality in this 
group was 58 (4.0%) with a predicted mortality of 72.08 (SMR, 
0.805; p = 0.05). Admission Pao 
2 ranged from 14 to 613 mm Hg 
(1.87–81.7 kPa) with a median of 144 mm Hg (19.2 kPa) (IQR, 
99–202 mm Hg [13.2–26.9 kPa]). Admission Fio 
2 was recorded in 
1,290 patients and ranged from 0.21 to 1.00 (median, 0.40; IQR, 
0.30–0.51). A total of 1,021 patients (70.5%) received invasive or 
noninvasive mechanical ventilatory support within the first hour 
of admission. When compared with patients who did not have 
Pao 
2 
2 recorded at admission, patients in whom admission Pao 
was measured had significantly higher mortality (4.0% vs 1.8%; 
p < 0.001) were significantly older (median [IQR], 3.2 yr [0.7– 
10.2 yr] vs 1.3 yr [0.3–6.1 yr]; p < 0.001) and were more likely 
to receive invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilatory support 
within the first hour of admission (70.5% vs 41.2%; p < 0.001). 
The most common admission diagnoses were broadly sim- 
ilar in the subgroup with Pao 
2 measured at admission com- 
pared with the entire cohort of intensive care patients. For

the entire ICU cohort, the top five diagnoses were bronchiol- 
itis (n = 839), postoperative anterior or posterior craniotomy 
(n = 270), postoperative cardiac surgery (n = 256), asthma 
(n = 214), and seizure disorder (n = 211). Four of the top five 
most common diagnoses for the entire cohort were also among 
the top five diagnoses for the subgroup with Pao 
2 measured. 
In this subgroup, the top five diagnoses were as follows: post- 
operative cardiac surgery (n = 245), postoperative anterior or 
posterior craniotomy (n = 158), bronchiolitis (n = 67), postop- 
erative spinal instrumentation (n = 66), and seizure disorder 
(n = 51). 

A significant proportion of patients were hyperoxic at 
admission using commonly accepted definitions (22, 23). 
Mild hyperoxia (Pao 
2, 121–200 mm Hg [16.1–26.7 kPa]) was 
recorded in 512 of 1,447 patients (35.6%), and a further 401

(27.9%) had severe hyperoxia (Pao 
2 bands of 
50 mm Hg (6.67 kPa) (i.e., 1–50 mm Hg, 51–100 mm Hg, 
101–151 mm Hg, and so on). Patients with Pao 
2 greater than 
350 mm Hg (46.7 kPa) were grouped together because of 
small number of patients in each 50 mm Hg band above this 
value. A U-shaped relationship between raw mortality and 
admission Pao 
2 was observed, with lowest mortality (2.30% 
and 2.56%, respectively) observed in the 101–150 and 151– 
200 mm Hg (13.5–20.0 and 20.1–26.7 kPa) bands (Table 1). 
Although mortality was increased in patients with both low 
and high Pao 
2, the highest mortality was observed in hyper- 
oxic rather than hypoxic patients. Mortality in the lowest 
2 1–50 mm Hg (0.1–6.67 kPa), was 5.3% (2/38), 
band, Pao 
compared with 18.2% (8/44) in the group with Pao 
2 greater 
than 350 mm Hg (46.7 kPa). Polynomial regression with 2 df 
revealed a close correlation between admission Pao 
2 and ICU 
mortality (r2 = 0.981) (Fig. 1). 
Adjusting mortality using PIM-3–generated similar results 
in that hyperoxia (although not hypoxia) was associated with 
an increased risk of mortality. Risk-adjusted mortality was 
2 of 250 mm Hg (33.3 kPa) with 
relatively constant up to a Pao 
SMR ranging from 0.58 to 0.69, but increased sharply at higher 

2 values with SMR of 1.0, 1.18, and 1.22 in the next three

The single largest diagnostic group was patients admitted to 
the ICU following cardiac surgery. Hyperoxia at admission to 
the ICU is likely to be commonly observed in this group given 
that they are all transferred from the operating theater, almost 
2. Although the predicted mortality in 
invariably with high Fio 
most postoperative cardiac patients is not substantially differ- 
ent to that of a general ICU cohort, the causes of mortality may 
well be different, and a recent publication identified hyperoxia 
as an independent risk for death in postoperative cardiac surgi- 
cal patients requiring extracorporeal support (20). Removing 
this subgroup from the analysis did not materially change the 
results of the polynomial regression. In the cohort of patients 
who were not admitted following cardiac surgery (n = 1,202), 
both raw mortality and SMR were strongly associated with 
2 band (r2 = 0.988 and 0.925, respectively). There was only 
Pao

one death in the cardiac subgroup, making analysis by Pao 
band uninformative.

ing PIM-3 score in multivariate analysis marginally improved 
the performance of the score (area under ROC curve 0.956 
compared with 0.951 without the hyperoxia variable; p = not

values (26, 27). 


Our data demonstrate a strong correlation between admis- 
sion hyperoxia and risk-adjusted mortality (r2 = 0.845). 
Inclusion of hyperoxia as a categorical variable in PIM was 
statistically significant with OR equals to 2.66 (p = 0.047) but 
failed to significantly improve the area under the ROC curve, 
suggesting only marginal utility as an outcome predictor. 
2 measured 
Additionally, only a minority of patients have Pao 
at admission (28% of all ICU patients in this study), which 
potentially limits the usefulness of this parameter as a pre- 
dictive variable for mortality, although this criticism can be 
applied to several PIM variables including systolic blood pres- 
sure, base excess, and Fio 
2 ratio. 
The results of this study suggest that further exploration of 
the potentially toxic effects of hyperoxia in critically ill patients 
is warranted. Studies in both general adult ICU populations (21, 
23) and specific diagnostic groups (6–10, 16–18) have indicated 
that hyperoxia may pose a mortality risk that (if validated) can be 


or attempted to gauge cumulative exposure to hyperoxia by 
interpolating sequential blood gas results (23). As with most 
biological insults, it is more likely that toxicity will be related 
to an “area under curve” parameter reflecting total exposure 
rather than a single-point measurement. Helmerhorst et al 
(23) demonstrated a linear correlation between risk-adjusted 
in-hospital mortality and hours of hyperoxia, with a weaker 
correlation between first-recorded Pao 
2 (obtained at a median 
of 26 min after ICU admission) and ICU outcome in 14,441 
adult ICU patients. Helmerhorst et al (23) also demonstrated 
a correlation between oxygen parameters measured in the first 
24 hours of admission and cumulative exposure estimated 
from interpolation of all arterial blood gases, suggesting that 
early point measurements of Pao 
2 may have some value as an 
estimate of cumulative exposure. 
Although there is no reason to necessarily expect that Pao 
2 
measured at admission to the ICU will correlate with cumula- 
tive exposure to hyperoxia throughout the ICU stay, it remains 
a worthwhile parameter to explore on the basis that it may 
reflect a period of some hours antecedent hyperoxia (e.g., dur- 
ing surgery, emergency department resuscitation, or retrieval 
before ICU admission). Because Pao 
2 is collected as part of 
the PIM dataset in PICU, existing data are readily available

easily avoided. Correlation does not necessarily imply causation, 
and other explanations can be proposed. Potentially confound- 
ing variables including the use of vasoactive and ventilatory 
support, fluid resuscitation, and surgical and other procedural 
interventions were not examined but could impact on the rela- 
tionships observed in this study. The inherent selection bias of 
including only patients who had Pao 
2 measured within an hour 
of admission to the ICU suggests that our findings should not 
necessarily be generalized to all pediatric intensive care patients. 
It has been suggested that cumulative exposure to hyperoxia 
during the course of an ICU stay may simply be a marker for 
a lack of responsive care rather than a causative factor for bad 
outcomes of itself (23), and our data suggest that there may be 
associations between hyperoxia and particular diagnostic cate- 
gories (e.g., sepsis) that carry high mortality risk. In this setting, 
hyperoxia at admission to the ICU may simply be a marker for 
severity of critical illness rather than a causative factor for poor 
outcomes. Nevertheless, there is biological plausibility for hyper- 
oxia to be injurious, particularly in critical illness (14, 28, 29). 
An important finding in this study was the high incidence 
of hyperoxia in patients admitted to ICU. This underscores a 
widespread acceptance of high arterial oxygen saturation and 
Pao 
2 values among medical staff, which may not be appropriate 
given the emerging data. Given the prevalence of hyperoxia in 
our patients, identification of any deleterious effect is of consid- 
erable importance, particularly as there is some evidence to sug- 
gest that limiting exposure to hyperoxia can reduce intensive care 
and hospital mortality. A randomized controlled trial comparing 
a conservative oxygen regimen (targeting Pao 
2 70–100 mm Hg 
[9.3–13.3 kPa]) compared with a more liberal oxygen regimen 
(allowing Pao 
2 up to 150 mm Hg [20 kPa]) was recently reported 
from a single adult ICU in Italy (30), with a substantial reduction 
in ICU mortality observed in conservative oxygen group—11.6% 
compared with 20.2% in the more liberal oxygen group. A reduc- 
tion in hospital (but not ICU) mortality was associated with the 
introduction of a conservative oxygen regimen targeting Pao 
2 
55–86 mm Hg (7.3–11.5 kPa) in 15,045 adult ICU patients (31). 
Targeting moderately low Pao 
2 or saturation values (e.g., satura- 
tions of 88–92% in one recent study [32]) appears to be safe and 
feasible in adult ICU populations, but there are no data in pedi- 
atric populations. Hypoxia is, obviously, potentially deleterious, 
and any consideration of lower Pao 
2 or oxygen saturation targets 
must be approached with considerable caution. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this single-center study, hyperoxia at admission to the 
PICU was common and was highly correlated with increased 
risk-adjusted mortality, although it is not clear whether this 
represents true causation. Further investigation of these obser- 
vations in a large multicenter cohort is warranted.
