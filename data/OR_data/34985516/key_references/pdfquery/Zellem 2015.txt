Aim: The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between the partial pressure of arterial oxygen 
(PaO2) and in-hospital (IH) mortality in children after cardiac arrest (CA) using the conventional cutoff 
analysis, which was compared with the cumulative analysis, a new method in PaO2 analysis. Addition- 
ally, we analyzed this relationship for children with and without mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH; 
32–34 ◦C). 
Methods: This observational cohort study included all children (aged >28 days) with CA and return of 
spontaneous circulation (ROSC) between 2002 and 2011. 
The ﬁrst research question was the association between PaO2 and IH mortality after ROSC. This was ana- 
lyzed for three hyperoxia cutoff values, and for three time intervals using the cumulative PaO2 determined 
with the area under the curve (AUC). For the second research question, these analyses were repeated for 
children with and without MTH. 
Results: Of the 200 patients included (median age 2.6 years), 84 (42%) survived to hospital discharge. 
Fifty-eight children (29%) were treated with MTH. 
With the cutoff analysis and the AUC analysis we found no relationship between PaO2 and IH mortality. 
However, analysis of the MTH-group showed a lower IH mortality in children with high cumulative PaO2 
levels on two of the three time intervals. Multivariable analysis showed signiﬁcantly higher odds of 
survival (0.643 (95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.424–0.976), 0.554 (95%CI 0.335–0.916)). 
Conclusions: Cumulative PaO2 analysis showed that the IH mortality is signiﬁcantly lower in MTH-treated 
children with high PaO2 levels. The effects of cumulative PaO2 on the outcome need to be studied further, 
and this will help us to achieve individualized goal-directed therapy.

Cardiac arrest (CA) in children is uncommon and associated 
with high mortality (50–90%).1–6 Oxygen therapy has always been 
important in the treatment of CA. However, there is increasing 
evidence for the adverse effects of oxygen. Oxidative stress and 
reperfusion promote free radical-generated injury contributing 
to neurologic injury and cardiac dysfunction, and they seem to 
be associated with increased mortality after CA.7,8 Furthermore, 
 meta-analysis of animal studies by Pilcher et al. showed that 
a 
treatment with 100% oxygen after resuscitation resulted in signiﬁ- 
cantly worse neurological deﬁcit scores than oxygen administered 
at lower concentrations.9 
Observational studies in humans examined the inﬂuence of 
arterial oxygen (PaO2) on in-hospital (IH) mortality. They used 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


different time intervals after return of spontaneous circulation 
(ROSC) and different deﬁnitions of hyperoxia, or included only 
patients treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH), which 
resulted in contradictory conclusions.10–16 Most studies used an 
arbitrary cutoff value to describe the inﬂuence of PaO2 on the 
IH mortality. Only two studies used an alternative method. Janz 
et al. used PaO2 as a continuous value and Ferguson et al. modeled 
the ﬁrst PaO2 within the ﬁrst hour after ROSC in a non-linear 
matter.11,13 
In contrast with previous studies, we hypothesized that not a 
single value above a previously set cutoff, but rather the cumulative 
PaO2 during the ﬁrst 24 h after ROSC (especially the ﬁrst 6 h) is asso- 
ciated with worse survival of children with CA. Our ﬁrst research 
question was the association between PaO2 and the IH mortality, 
analyzed with the commonly used cutoff method and compared 
with a cumulative method. In addition, although the evidence for 
the protective effects of MTH is debatable, we hypothesized that 
MTH is protective against the effects of hyperoxia, as it is the only 
post-resuscitation intervention, introduced in our hospital in 2007, 
in accordance with international guidelines. 

This observational cross-sectional cohort study was performed 
at the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Erasmus MC – Sophia 
Children’s Hospital, a tertiary-care university hospital. Our hos- 
pital provides health care to children in the southwest of The 
Netherlands (total population of approximately 4.2 million peo- 
ple), and this population is a representative sample of the Dutch 
population. 

This study concerned all patients aged >28 days and <18 years 
with documented CA between January 2002 and December 2011, 
and admitted to the ICU of the Erasmus MC – Sophia Children’s 
Hospital. CA was deﬁned as absent pulse rate or the need for cardiac 
compressions. Treatment of children with CA in our hospital has 
been in line with the European Resuscitation Council guidelines for 
pediatric life support.17 
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) all children resusci- 
tated in-hospital (e.g. emergency department, ward, or ICU) and 
out-of-hospital, and consecutively admitted to our ICU, and (2) 
children resuscitated in a regional hospital or other university hos- 
pital, and after ROSC consecutively admitted to our ICU. Neonatal 
resuscitations, children with cyanotic congenital heart disease, and 
children without an arterial line were excluded. In addition, only 
data of the ﬁrst CA episode were included when a child had multiple 
arrests. 
Hypothermia was introduced as treatment after CA in children 
with post-resuscitation coma in 2007. Hypothermia was started 
as soon as possible following ROSC. Hypothermia was achieved by 
administering a bolus of cold ﬂuids and applying external cooling 
using a mattress with Blanketrol® III (Cincinnati Sub-Zero Products, 
Inc., Sharonville, OH, USA). The target temperature is 32–34 ◦C for 
24 h following ROSC, after which they were rewarmed passively 
at a rate of 0.5 ◦C per 2 h. The target temperature must have been 
reached for MTH to be effective. Children in whom the target tem- 
perature range was not reached were classiﬁed as “without MTH”. 

All CA data were retrospectively collected. CA data were derived 
from ambulance registration forms, clinical medical records, elec- 
tronic medical records, Patient Data Management System (PDMS), 
and CA registration forms. The starting point of the time interval of 
collected data (T = 0) was deﬁned as the actual time of ROSC or, if 
unknown, the time of ICU admission. 
The following data were collected: (1) basic patient character- 
istics (e.g., gender, age, and medical history), (2) CA characteristics 
(e.g., type of resuscitation (basic life support (BLS)/advanced pedi- 
atric life support (APLS)), etiology of arrest, ﬁrst monitored rhythm, 
bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and location), and 
(3) outcome (IH mortality). 
For all children, laboratory values (arterial pH, lactate, and 
PaO2) and data regarding MTH (time period before MTH reached, 
lowest temperature if >34 ◦C) were retrospectively collected. The 
laboratory values of all children were automatically recalculated 
to the value at 37 ◦C, as this is a standard procedure in our 
hospital.18 

The primary outcome measure was IH mortality. The ﬁrst 
research question was the association between PaO2 and IH mor- 
tality. The second question was the inﬂuence of MTH on this 
association. 
In the ﬁrst analysis of the ﬁrst research question, we explored 
the association between PaO2 and IH mortality for different cut- 
off values of hyperoxia (>200, >250 and >300 mmHg) as proposed 
in the literature.13–16 Logistic regression analysis was applied to 
explore the inﬂuence of hyperoxia on IH mortality with the highest 
PaO2 over the ﬁrst 24 h. In the multivariable analysis, we calculated 
an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for pre-selected variables: age, gender, 
type of resuscitation (BLS/APLS), location, rhythm, lowest pH and 
highest lactate. 
In the second analysis of the ﬁrst research question, the “area 
under the curve” (AUC) of PaO2 was calculated for each patient to 
determine the inﬂuence of the cumulative PaO2 on IH mortality. 
The trapezoidal method was used. A minimum of four PaO2 mea- 
surements and an overall time interval of at least 12 h were required 
to include the arterial measurements and their corresponding time 
points in the analysis. This resulted in a cumulative PaO2 over the 
0–6 h, 6–24 h, and 0–24 h interval after ROSC. The AUC was cor- 
rected for the time in which the PaO2 was measured, as not all 
patients had a 24 h time period in which PaO2 was measured. This 
resulted in a cumulative PaO2 per hour, which was converted into 
the cumulative PaO2 by multiplying with 6, 18, or 24, respectively. 
In univariable logistic regression analyses, the assumption that 
the AUC of PaO2 had a linear effect on the logit of IH mortality was 
tested using the Box–Tidwell test (i.e., an interaction term between 
the covariate and its natural logarithm was added to the model). 
If any signiﬁcant interaction between the covariate and its natu- 
ral logarithm was present, the linearity assumption was violated. 
Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis (with the 
same preselected variables as in the cutoff analysis) was applied to 
evaluate the relationship between cumulative PaO2 and IH mor- 
tality over the three time intervals after ROSC. In advance of the 
regression analysis, the original AUC variables were rescaled by 
dividing by 100 to obtain more distinctive results out of the logistic 
regression analysis. 


Univariable comparison of the distribution of patient character- 
istics and clinical data between survivors and non-survivors was 
performed by independent sample t-tests for normally distributed 
data, and Mann–Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed 
data. Normality was examined with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. 
Fisher’s exact test was used for comparison of dichotomous data. 
Statistical signiﬁcance was considered with two-tailed p-value of 
≤0.05. 


survival rate of children without MTH treatment, which was no 
longer present in the multivariable analysis. 

Forty-eight children (24%) were excluded from the AUC calcu- 
lation (less than four measurements and/or time interval <12 h) 
(Table 1). 


Univariable and multivariable regression analyses showed no 
signiﬁcant relationship between the cumulative AUC of PaO2 and 
IH mortality (Table 2). 
Multivariable regression analysis, evaluating the relationship 
between cumulative PaO2 and IH mortality for patients with and 
without MTH, showed an overall signiﬁcant difference (OR 0.916, 
95% CI 0.843–0.995; p = 0.038) toward a lower risk of mortality over 
the 0–24 h interval in patients with MTH. This was also found on the 
6–24 h interval (OR 0.882, 95% CI 0.792–0.981; p = 0.021) in patients 
with MTH (Fig. 2). 

As shown by ﬁve examples (Fig. 3), both methods led to substan- 
tially different results. As to the cumulative PaO2 in patients with 
MTH, the mean AUC of survivors with MTH was 502.7 points higher 
over the 0–24 h interval, and 469.9 points higher over the 6–24 h 
interval, than that of non-survivors. As the AUC was rescaled before 
being entered in the regression analysis, the mean difference had 
to be rescaled by dividing by 100. Ultimately, this resulted in a clin- 
ically relevant difference in OR of 0.643 (95% CI 0.424–0.976) and 
0.554 (95% CI 0.335–0.916). The odds of survival are signiﬁcantly 
increased in children with higher cumulative PaO2 levels over the 
6–24 h and 0–24 h interval. 

The innovative aspect of this study is that it uses a novel and 
simple method to analyze cumulative PaO2. We found that patients 
with MTH and higher cumulative PaO2 had a lower mortality rate. 
With the cumulative PaO2 measurement, we could not reproduce 
the relationship between higher PaO2 and IH mortality in children 
after CA as found in various cutoff studies. It is important to note 
that, due to the retrospective nature, small sample size, and hetero- 
geneous population, we did not determine causation in this study, 
this study is hypothesis generating. 

The patient sample was heterogeneous in terms of location and 
etiologies, among other things, which was also the case in other 
studies.10,11,13,15 Half of the CAs were out-of-hospital CAs, the pro- 
portion of which was within the range reported in other studies 
(from 43% to 58%).12,13,16 In our population, out-of-hospital CA was 
also more common (70%) in patients with MTH. 
Only 32% underwent MTH after CA, because MTH was newly 
introduced in our clinical protocol in 2007 and it was only used in 
children with post-resuscitative coma after CPR. Similar to other 
studies our median time to reach the MTH target temperature 
was >6 h, most probably due to unfamiliarity with the new pro- 
tocol and failure of the technique.19,20 The exact timing to start 
hypothermia after ROSC is controversial, as well as the duration and 
temperature.21–23 There could be a therapeutic window in which 
hypothermia should be applied.21,23 Furthermore, controlling the 
effects of systemic inﬂammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with 
continued normothermia could be important.22 

All analyses were performed with SPSS 21.0 for Windows (SPSS, 
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) or GraphPad Prism 5.00 for Windows (Graph- 
Pad Software, Inc.). 


Between January 2002 and December 2011, a total of 474 CA 
events were documented. ROSC was achieved in 335 events (70%). 
An overview of the patient inclusion is given in Fig. 1. The basic 
patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. 
MTH was initiated in 63 (32%) children, 58 (92%) of whom 
reached the target temperature in a median time of 6.7 h (range: 
0.8–21.3) for survivors and 6.3 h (range: 0.4–25.5) for non-survivors 
after ROSC. 
Eventually, 116 of the 200 children (58%) died within a median 
of 2 days (range: 0–135; 40 died within the ﬁrst 24 h) after ROSC. 
The major cause of death was withdrawal of life-sustaining treat- 
ment (poor physical and/or (neuro)psychological outcome based 
on repeated neurological examination, brain imaging, and elec- 
troencephalography) (n = 52, 45%), followed by brain death based 
on the criteria of whole-brain death (n = 31, 27%), cardiorespiratory 
failure/multiple-organ failure (n = 31, 27%), and underlying disease 
(n = 2, 2%). 

All 200 patients were included in the cutoff analysis. No signif- 
icant difference between survivors and non-survivors was found 
(Table 1).

Most studies on hyperoxia and CA used a single cutoff value to 
describe PaO2 over different time periods after ROSC.10,12,14–16 Such 
cutoff analyses may be limited, however, in their ability to approx- 
imate the complex oxygen physiology as ﬂuctuations of PaO2 are 
common. Using AUC as a measure of cumulative exposure to oxy- 
gen, patients with MTH and high cumulative PaO2 levels had a 
lower mortality rate, which was not found in the cutoff analyses. In 
addition, we did not ﬁnd any harmful effects of the high cumulative 
arterial oxygen levels whatsoever. This supports our hypothesis 
that the method of analysis is important in the approximation of 
oxygen physiology. A dichotomous cutoff value cannot account for 
the amount of oxygen and duration, an inherent problem of sum- 
marizing a continuous variable with an important time course as a 
dichotomous variable. 
We chose to use different time periods in the AUC analysis, as 
both direct cell injury after an ischemic event and delayed cell death 
known as reperfusion injury have an important inﬂuence on the 
outcome. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to compare our results with other

studies, but these different methods extend our knowledge of these 
concepts. 
The cumulative PaO2 can be legitimately measured with the 
trapezoidal AUC method.24 This method is commonly used in phar- 
macokinetic research to measure the total drug exposure, and it has 
also been used in other medical ﬁelds, for instance in metabolic 
research and pulmonary research. 

The analysis of patients without MTH showed no signiﬁcant 
relationship between PaO2 and IH mortality, regardless of the 
method used. This is similar to ﬁndings of Bellomo et al., who found 
no signiﬁcant difference after Cox proportional-hazards modeling 
in a large retrospective cohort of 12,108 patients.10 
In multivariable analysis, clinically relevant differences in OR 
were found. There are various explanations for our ﬁndings. One 
important new theory is that of a therapeutic window for oxygen. 
As suggested by Martin et al., precise control of arterial oxygenation 
may avoid harmful effects associated with unnecessary extremes 
of arterial oxygenation.25 Based on physiological principles, they 
constructed a scheme with an optimal therapeutic oxygenation 
range. This optimal range will probably be dependent on factors 
such as age, clinical setting, underlying disease, and other comor- 
bidities. In our retrospective cohort, the cumulative oxygen levels 
in survivors with MTH were higher than in the non-survivors with 
MTH. This suggests that MTH might shift the optimal therapeutic 
range wherein high cumulative oxygen levels could be favorable 
compared to lower cumulative oxygen levels. 
An alternative explanation is the possibility of impairments 
in microcirculatory function. As shown by van Genderen et al. 
and Buijs et al., macrocirculatory parameters cannot estimate 
microcirculatory function and MTH causes abnormalities in micro- 
circulation and peripheral tissue perfusion.26,27 Buijs et al. found 
that the microcirculation was impaired during MTH and more 
severely impaired at the start of MTH in non-survivors. Despite

impairments in microcirculatory function during MTH, increased 
amounts of dissolved oxygen could have maintained oxygen sup- 
ply to the organs in the patients in the present study. Measurement 
of systemic and cerebral tissue oxygenation by near-infrared spec- 
troscopy, Laser–Doppler spectroscopy, functional imaging, and 
perhaps even invasive methods, is necessary to study the inter- 
acting effects of hyperoxia and hypothermia on the outcome in 
children after CA. 
Another explanation could be the synergistic effect of hypother- 
mia and hyperoxia. It has been demonstrated that hypothermia 
attenuates oxidative stress after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in 
children.28 Hyperoxia has been shown to improve organ function, 
and to attenuate tissue apoptosis and oxidative stress during early 
septic shock.29 Even anti-inﬂammatory effects of hyperoxia are 
reported.30 
Hyperoxia causes vasoconstriction. The mechanisms underly- 
ing this vasoconstriction are not well understood, but there are 
different theories as mentioned by Sjoberg and Singer.30 

Several limitations of our study should be acknowledged. First, 
this is an observational, retrospective, single-center cohort study 
in a heterogeneous population without a control group over a rela- 
tively long study interval. Changes in clinical care during this study 
period will have improved the outcome after CA; however this 
probably did not change the impact of high oxygen levels on the 
outcome, as the attention was more focused on preventing hypoxia, 
rather than avoiding hyperoxia. Only recent international CA guide- 
lines have recommended avoiding an arterial oxygen saturation of 
100%.17 
Another limitation is that the time intervals of PaO2 measure- 
ments were not standardized. We would recommend measuring 
PaO2 at least every hour, which permits a more precise measure- 
ment of the AUC and thus a better estimation of the inﬂuence of 
PaO2 on mortality. 

 third limitation is the small number of patients in which MTH 
was applied, as therapeutic hypothermia was introduced halfway 
through the study period. However, this number of patients was not 
smaller than that in other studies.19,31 As our ﬁndings stem from 
a 
 small heterogeneous group of patients, we expect they will most 
probably be conﬁrmed by larger, homogeneous groups of patients. 



Lastly, the information on temperature is limited. We recorded 
the time in which MTH was reached, but we did not document 
the course of the temperature during the following 24 h and during 
rewarming. In addition, we did not document the presence of fever. 

Aware of the limitations of our study, we would recommend 
standardized prospective collection of all CA-related data in chil- 
dren in large multicenter networks. Retrospective analysis of a large 
set of prospective collected data will help us to answer such difﬁcult 
questions in our very heterogeneous populations. Additionally, we 
need to study the effects of PaO2 on physical outcome, neuropsy- 
chological outcome and health-related quality of life. Combining 
this information will help us to achieve goal-directed therapy 
which can automatically adjust the fraction of inspired oxygen to 
the individual physical demands of a child. Until individualized 
therapy can be practiced, we must use oxygen carefully within 
the therapeutic window and avoid the harmful effects of extreme 
values of PaO2.
