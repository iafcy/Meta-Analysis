Maximum Pao2 in the First 72 Hours of Intensive 
Care Is Associated With Risk-Adjusted Mortality 
in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Mechanical 
Ventilation
Abstract: A relationship between Pao2 and mortality has previously been 
observed in single-center studies. We performed a retrospective cohort 
study of the Pediatric Health Information System plus database includ-
ing patients less than or equal to 21 years old admitted to a medical or 
cardiac ICU who received invasive ventilation within 72 hours of admis-
sion. We trained and validated a multivariable logistic regression mortality 
prediction model with very good discrimination (C-statistic, 0.86; 95% 
CI, 0.79–0.92; area under the precision-recall curve, 0.39) and accept-
able calibration (standardized mortality ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.75–1.23; 
calibration belt p = 0.07). Maximum Pao2 measurements demonstrated 
a parabolic (“U-shaped”) relationship with PICU mortality (Box-Tidwell  
p < 0.01). Maximum Pao2 was a statistically significant predictor of 
risk-adjusted mortality (standardized odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.23–
1.32; p < 0.001). This analysis is the first multicenter pediatric study to 
identify a relationship between the extremes in Pao2 values and PICU 
mortality. Clinicians should remain judicious in the use of oxygen when 
caring for children.

ecently, there has been increasing interest in hyperoxemia. 
Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses 
of oxygen management strategies in adults have come to 
differing conclusions regarding the importance of hyperoxemia 
(1–3). While fewer data exist for children, there is a growing body 
of literature identifying a relationship between the Pao2 values 
and mortality in PICU settings (4–7). Limitations of these previ-
ous studies include data from single centers, variable definitions of 
hyperoxemia, and absent or uncalibrated risk-adjustment strate-
gies. Our objective was to examine the relationship between the 
Pao2 values and mortality among critically ill children in a large 
multicenter cohort, adjusting with a well-calibrated mortality risk 
model. We hypothesized that both hypoxemia and hyperoxemia 
would demonstrate an association with risk-adjusted mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We performed a retrospective cohort study of the Pediatric Health 
Information System plus (PHIS+) database, a collection of fed-
erated electronic health record data containing laboratory results 
and quality-controlled administrative data from six large pediatric 
hospitals between 2010 and 2012 (8). We included patients with 
21 years old or younger that were admitted to a pediatric general 
or cardiac ICU with a hospital discharge date between January 1, 
2010, and December 31, 2012, who received invasive mechanical 
ventilation within 72 hours of admission and who had at least one 
Pao2 value obtained. We excluded patients who were admitted to a 
neonatal ICU or who received extracorporeal membrane oxygen-
ation. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The study 
was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review 
Board.
Because prior work has suggested a parabolic (“U-shaped”) 
relationship between Pao2 and mortality (5, 6), we performed a 
Box-Tidwell test. We developed a multivariable logistic regres-
sion model of predicted mortality, with a random effect for hos-
pital, and plotted the expected and actual mortalities of patients 
grouped by differing maximum Pao2 values using bin widths 
of 100 mm Hg. The variables used in the mortality prediction 
model are listed in Table 1. We divided the cohort into 80% 
training and 20% testing subsets. Backward stepwise selec-
tion was performed, taking variables with p value of less than 
0.05 as statistically significant. Discrimination was assessed 
using C-statistics with DeLong 95% CIs and area under the 
precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Calibration was assessed with 
standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) with Hosmer 95% CI and 
calibration belts, with p value of greater than or equal to 0.05 
deemed acceptable (9). Because the relationship between Pao2 
and mortality was nonlinear, we performed polynomial (para-
bolic) regression. This approach is similar to standard logistic 
regression, but allows the demonstration of the “U-shaped” 
relationship between the patients’ maximum Pao2 value and 
risk-adjusted mortality (with all other variables in the model 
taken into account), and calculation of where the lowest risk-
adjusted mortality occurred.
We conducted five sensitivity analyses. First, we excluded 
patients with a cardiovascular complex chronic condition flag 
(10). Second, we excluded patients with burns, carbon monoxide 
poisoning, or traumatic brain injury. Third, we excluded patients 
with cardiac arrest prior to admission. Fourth, because prior work 
has suggested a time-dependent effect of hyperoxemia (4–7), we 
restricted the cohort to patients with invasive mechanical ventila-
tion and Pao2 measurements within 24 hours of admission. Fifth, 
we broadened the cohort to include patients who underwent inva-
sive mechanical ventilation and Pao2 measurements at any time 
during admission. All analyses were performed in R (Versions 
3.5.1 and 4.0.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, 
Austria).

RESULTS
Cohort demographics are listed in Table 1. The mortality predic-
tion model had very good discrimination (C-statistic, 0.86; 95% CI, 
0.79–0.92; AUPRC, 0.39) and acceptable calibration (SMR, 0.96; 
95% CI, 0.75–1.23; calibration belt p = 0.07). The Box-Tidwell test 
indicated that the relationship between Pao2 and mortality was 
nonlinear (p < 0.01). The relationship between maximum Pao2 
and mortality is shown in Figure 1. Predicted and actual mortali-
ties are shown on the left axis, and the effect plot of maximum Pao2 
measurement with 95% CI is shown on the right axis. Maximum 
Pao2 had a statistically significant effect on risk-adjusted mortal-
ity. We observed a parabolic (“U-shaped”) relationship between 
maximum Pao2 and unadjusted mortality. Both absolute and risk-
adjusted mortalities fell until a maximum Pao2 value of 384 mm

Hg and then rose again. The relationship between maximum Pao2 
and risk-adjusted mortality was relatively flat between the values 
of 250–450 mm Hg.
Model performance was similar between the main analysis and 
the sensitivity analyses (Table 1), except that a model including 
Pao2 values from any time during admission displayed poor cali-
bration (calibration belt p < 0.01). A parabolic Pao2 term was a sig-
nificant predictor of mortality in all sensitivity analyses. The point 
of lowest risk-adjusted mortality was between 341 and 466 mm Hg 
for all analyses.
DISCUSSION
This is the first multicenter study of critically ill pediatric patients 
to identify a nonlinear (“U-shaped”) relationship between the Pao2 
values and mortality. In polynomial regression, odds of mortality 
increased with a maximum Pao2 value less than 250 mm Hg or 
greater than 450 mm Hg. However, in the binned analysis, patients 
with Pao2 values between 100 and 400 mm Hg had variable risk-
adjusted mortality. Clear trends of worsened risk-adjusted mortal-
ity in both analyses were present for patients with maximum Pao2 
values either less than 100 or greater than or equal to 400 mm Hg. 
A comparable effect was evident in multiple sensitivity analyses.
Previous studies have observed Pao2 threshold values between 
300 and 550 mm Hg to be associated with increased mortality 
(4–7). Together, these results suggest 
that both hypoxemia and extreme 
hyperoxemia are associated with 
risk-adjusted mortality; however, the 
precise thresholds associated with 
clinical harm remain uncertain and 
likely vary by clinical condition (4–
7). A recent randomized controlled 
trial among adults demonstrated no 
difference between conservative and 
liberal oxygen management strate-
gies (3). However, the highest Pao2 
measurements in the liberal oxygen 
therapy group from that study were 
less than 150 mm Hg. In contrast, 
the present study and several prior 
pediatric studies (4–7) have demon-
strated a significant association only 
with either extreme hyperoxemia 
and death. In the present study, the 
optimal maximum Pao2 value in the 
first 72 hours of mechanical ventila-
tion appears to be between 100 and 
400 mm Hg.
Expert opinion has suggested 
that extreme hyperoxemia may be 
an indirect measurement of patients 
undergoing brain death testing or 
being assessed for organ donation 
eligibility (4). However, as relatively 
few PICU patients undergo brain 
death testing within 24 hours of 
admission, the findings of our sensitivity analysis, combined with 
prior studies of the impact of early hyperoxemia, would suggest 
this is less likely (6, 7).
Many administrative databases contain limited clinical data, 
precluding risk-adjustment according to previously validated 
severity of illness scores. The PHIS+ data include federated labo-
ratory results, allowing for improved risk-adjustment compared 
with administrative data alone. Our risk model incorporated 
important laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, including 
Pco2, lactate, WBC count, platelet count, international normal-
ized ratio, and pH. However, in the absence of granular clinical 
data, the findings from the database review such that the present 
study should be considered hypothesis-generating.
This work has several limitations, including the retrospective 
observational design. Additionally, because the maximum Pao2 
value for each patient in the first 72 hours was examined, this study 
does not address what Pao2 should be targeted for a sustained 
period of time. Because PHIS+ does not include provider notes, 
it is possible that children with hyperoxemia or hypoxemia were 
managed according to specific therapeutic targets. We attempted 
to control for such scenarios by excluding patients with burns, car-
bon monoxide poisoning, or traumatic brain injury; however, we 
cannot fully exclude confounding by indication. Similarly, we can-
not exclude that these children were moribund for other reasons

of admission. The x-axis shows the maximum Pao2 value obtained within 72 hr of admission. The bars on the left 
y-axis divide patients into bins based on their maximum Pao2 value (using a bin width of 100 mm Hg) and show 
the actual (light gray) and predicted (dark gray) percent mortalities for each of the bins, using a multivariable 
model that does not include a Pao2 term. The numbers below the bars show the number of patients in each bin. 
The solid and dashed lines on the right y-axis show an effect plot of a parabolic Pao2 term on a multivariable 
mortality prediction model. This represents the effect of maximum Pao2 value on mortality when all other 
variables in the model are held constant. The solid line represents the line of best fit, and the dashed lines 
represent the 95% CI.

that are not captured by the variables listed in Table 1. Finally, 
bin widths of 100 mm Hg were chosen to ensure adequate sample 
size in each bin (e.g., using a bin width of 50 mm Hg would have 
resulted in zero patients with a maximum Pao2 between 450 and 
499 mm Hg). Exploratory analyses did not suggest that smaller bin 
widths would have altered the analysis findings (e.g., patients with 
maximum Pao2 values of < 50 and 50–99 mm Hg had mortali-
ties of 8.2% and 8.0%, respectively). However, the precision of the 
binned analysis is limited by sample size.
The present work is the first multicenter pediatric study to con-
firm a parabolic relationship between the Pao2 values and risk-
adjusted PICU mortality. Maximum Pao2 values less than 100 or 
greater than or equal to 400 mm Hg were associated with increased 
mortality among invasively ventilated patients. While a prospec-
tive study is necessary to determine whether a causal relationship 
exists, the present results suggest clinicians should be judicious in 
the use of high Fio2 therapy in the absence of a specific indication.
