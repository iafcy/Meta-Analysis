Objective—To determine the frequency of hyperoxia and hypocapnia during pediatric ECMO 
and their relationships to complications, mortality and functional status among survivors.
Design—Secondary analysis of data collected prospectively by the Collaborative Pediatric 
Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN).
Setting—Eight CPCCRN-affiliated hospitals.
Patients—Age <19 years and treated with ECMO.
Interventions—Hyperoxia was defined as highest PaO2 >200 Torr (27 kPa), and hypocapnia as 
lowest PaCO2 <30 Torr (3.9 kPa) during the first 48 hours of ECMO. Functional status at hospital 
discharge was evaluated among survivors using the Functional Status Scale.
Measurements and Main Results—Of 484 patients, 420 (86.7%) had venoarterial ECMO 
and 64 (13.2%) venovenous; 69 (14.2%) had ECMO initiated during cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (ECPR). Hyperoxia occurred in 331 (68.4%) and hypocapnia in 98 (20.2%). 
Hyperoxic patients had higher mortality than patients without hyperoxia (167 (50.5%) vs. 48 
(31.4%), p<0.001), but no difference in functional status among survivors. Hypocapnic patients 
were more likely to have a neurologic event (49 (50.0%) vs. 143 (37.0%), p=0.021) or hepatic 
dysfunction (49 (50.0%) vs. 121 (31.3%), p<0.001) than patients without hypocapnia, but no 
difference in mortality or functional status among survivors. On multivariable analysis, factors 
independently associated with increased mortality included highest PaO2 and highest blood lactate 
concentration in the first 48 hours of ECMO, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and being a preterm 
neonate. Factors independently associated with lower mortality included meconium aspiration 
syndrome.
Conclusions—Hyperoxia is common during pediatric ECMO and associated with mortality. 
Hypocapnia appears to occur less often and although associated with complications, an association 
with mortality was not observed.

INTRODUCTION
Hyperoxia has been associated with adverse outcomes from several conditions complicated 
by reperfusion injury such as cardiac arrest (1–3), traumatic brain injury (4–5), and neonatal 
asphyxia (6). The influx of oxygen during reperfusion of ischemic tissue leads to production 
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by altered mitochondria and enzymes (7, 8). Hyperoxia 
during reperfusion may increase production of ROS, exacerbating their pathological effects. 
ROS cause peroxidation of lipids, denaturation of proteins and damage to DNA. The damage 
produced to these macromolecules can cause abnormal gene expression and impaired 
cellular functioning. In addition, ROS activate neutrophils and platelets leading to an 
exaggerated inflammatory and thrombotic cascade.
Hypocapnia has also been associated with adverse outcomes after cardiac arrest (9–12), 
traumatic brain injury (13–14), stroke (15) and neonatal asphyxia (6, 16). Hypocapnia may

contribute to neurological injury by causing cerebral vasoconstriction, decreased cerebral 
blood flow, and increased cerebral ischemia (17). Some have found mild hypercapnia to be 
neuroprotective (11). In addition to increasing cerebral perfusion, mild hypercapnia may 
have anticonvulsant, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.
Investigators have begun to explore the potential impact of partial pressures of arterial 
oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2) on patient outcomes after extracorporeal 
circulation including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and cardiopulmonary 
bypass (7, 8, 18–21). Extracorporeal circulation exposes the patient’s blood to an artificial 
circuit, which elicits a systemic inflammatory response, and alters the redox equilibrium by 
increasing production of ROS (7, 8). Hyperoxia may intensify the oxidative stress elicited by 
circuit; however, the extent to which hyperoxia during extracorporeal circulation is 
associated with adverse patient outcomes is not well characterized. Similarly, little clinical 
data exist on the association between PaCO2 during extracorporeal circulation and patient 
outcomes. We hypothesize that both hyperoxia and hypocapnia during pediatric ECMO will 
be associated with worse patient outcomes. Our objective is to determine the frequency of 
hyperoxia and hypocapnia during pediatric ECMO and the relationships between these 
blood gas derangements and complications, mortality and functional status among survivors.
METHODS
Design and Setting
The study was a secondary analysis of data collected for the Bleeding and Thrombosis 
during ECMO (BATE) study (22) which aimed to describe the incidence of bleeding and 
thrombosis in neonatal and pediatric ECMO patients. In the BATE study, prospective 
observational data were collected at eight children’s hospitals affiliated with the Eunice 
Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Collaborative 
Pediatric Critical Care Research Network between December 2012 and September 2014. 
The Institutional Review Boards for each hospital and the Data Coordinating Center at the 
University of Utah approved the study with waiver of parental permission.
Study Subjects
All patients <19 years of age treated with ECMO in a neonatal, pediatric or cardiac intensive 
care unit (ICU) were included in the BATE study (n=514). Only the initial ECMO course 
was included for patients who required multiple courses of ECMO. Three patients had no 
arterial blood gases collected in the first 48 hours of ECMO and were excluded from this 
secondary analysis. In addition, 27 patients with hypoxia (i.e., highest PaO2 <60 Torr (8 
kPa) in the first 48 hours of ECMO) were excluded (see Statistical Analysis, below).
Data Collection
Trained research coordinators collected all data daily via direct observation, discussion with 
bedside clinicians, and review of medical records. Data included demographics; body 
weight; history of prematurity; acute and chronic diagnoses; occurrence of an operative 
procedure or cardiopulmonary bypass in the 24 hours prior to ECMO initiation; indications 
for ECMO; mode of ECMO; Vasoactive Inotrope Score (VIS) (23, 24) and Oxygenation

Index (OI) (25) at the time of ECMO initiation; body temperature, arterial blood gases (pH, 
PaO2, PaCO2) and lactate concentration closest and prior to ECMO initiation (baseline); 
arterial blood gases, lactate concentration and ECMO blood flow rate recorded closest to 7 
AM on each ECMO day; and clinical site.
Demographics included age at ECMO initiation, sex, race and ethnicity. Prematurity was 
<37 weeks gestational age at birth and collected for neonates only. Indications for ECMO 
were categorized as respiratory, cardiac or extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(ECPR). Mode of ECMO was categorized as venoarterial (VA) or venovenous (VV). VV 
ECMO that was converted to VA was categorized as VA ECMO. VIS (23, 24) was 
calculated from the hourly dose of dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, milrinone, 
vasopressin and norepinephrine administered at the time of ECMO initiation. Higher VIS 
scores indicate greater vasoactive and inotropic support. OI (25) was calculated from the 
mean airway pressure (MAP), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), and PaO2 at the time of 
ECMO initiation as MAP × FiO2 × 100/PaO2. Higher OI scores indicate greater intensity of 
ventilator support to maintain oxygenation. Hyperoxia was defined as highest PaO2 >200 
Torr (27 kPa), and hypocapnia as lowest PaCO2 <30 Torr (3.9 kPa) during the first 48 hours 
of ECMO (7, 26, 27). The first 48 hours of ECMO was selected in order to reflect the most 
vulnerable period for ischemia reperfusion injury (1, 3, 12, 18). Blood flow rate was the 
average blood flow rate in mL/kg/min over the first 48 hours of ECMO.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Other outcomes included complications 
during ECMO; duration of ECMO, and ICU and hospital stay; and functional status at 
hospital discharge among survivors. Complications included bleeding events, thrombotic 
events, neurologic events, hepatic dysfunction, and renal failure. Bleeding events were 
defined as blood loss requiring a transfusion or intracranial hemorrhage. Thrombotic events 
included intracranial infarction, limb ischemia, pulmonary embolus, intracardiac thrombus, 
aorto-pulmonary shunt thrombus, other sites of thrombosis, and circuit thrombosis requiring 
replacement of a circuit component. Neurologic events included seizures (clinical or 
electrographic), intracranial hemorrhage or infarction, and brain death. Hepatic dysfunction 
was defined as an International Normalized Ratio (INR) >2. Renal failure was defined as a 
creatinine concentration >2 mg/dL (>176.8 μmol/L) or use of renal replacement therapy. 
Functional status at hospital discharge was evaluated among survivors using the Functional 
Status Scale (FSS) (28). The FSS assesses function in six domains: mental, sensory, 
communication, motor, feeding and respiratory. Total FSS scores range from 6–30 and are 
categorized as 6–7 (good), 8–9 (mildly abnormal), 10–15 (moderately abnormal), 16–21 
(severely abnormal) and >21 (very severely abnormal).
Statistical Analysis
The relationship of hyperoxia and hypocapnia to pre-ECMO patient characteristics and 
outcomes was assessed with Fisher’s exact test for nominal variables and the Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test for ordinal variables. Prior to developing logistic regression models of in-
hospital mortality, the relationship of highest PaO2 and lowest PaCO2 in the first 48 hours of 
ECMO to mortality was explored using bar charts (Figures 1 and 2). PaCO2 did not appear

to have a strong relationship with mortality, but there was some tendency toward higher 
mortality with both low and high PaCO2 and lower mortality with moderate PaCO2. 
Therefore, PaCO2 could not be included as an interval predictor. Instead, a nominal variable 
was created with three levels, PaCO2 <30 Torr (3.9 kPa), 30–50 Torr (3.9–6.6 kPa) and >50 
Torr (>6.6 kPa). PaO2 was found to have a strong linear relationship with mortality, with 
higher PaO2 predicting a higher risk of mortality. The only exception to this was the 27 
hypoxic patients (PaO2 <60 Torr (<8 kPa)) who also had a high mortality rate. Rather than 
discretize PaO2 into a few levels, the 27 hypoxic patients were excluded from the analyses. 
This allowed PaO2 to be included as an interval variable so that the model could take full 
advantage of the strong linear relationship.
Mortality was modeled with univariable logistic regression in order to identify potential 
predictors. Variables associated with mortality in univariable models (p < 0.20) were 
considered potential predictors if data were missing for less than 10% of the cohort. The 
branch-and-bound algorithm of Furnival and Wilson (29) was used to identify the subset of 
potential predictors that generate the multivariable logistic regression model with the best 
penalized fit in terms of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Only models that 
included the primary variables of interest, PaO2 and PaCO2, were considered. In this way, 
the primary predictors were forced into the multivariable models. In addition to the subset of 
predictors achieving the best penalized fit, one additional model was within 2 points of this 
BIC. These two models are regarded as statistically equivalent in terms of penalized fit. 
Since both models achieved equivalent penalize fit, the authors selected the model with the 
most clinically relevant predictors as the final multivariable model. All analyses were 
performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute; Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Of 484 patients included in the study, 48 (9.9%) were preterm neonates, 209 (43.2%) full-
term neonates, and 227 (46.9%) infants, children and adolescents (Table 1). Two hundred 
and eighty (57.9%) were male, and 239 (49.4%) were White. Three hundred and thirty-one 
(68.4%) had hyperoxia and 98 (20.2%) had hypocapnia during the first 48 hours of ECMO. 
Median highest PaO2 was 261 Torr (IQR 155, 364) (35 kPa (IQR 20, 48)) and median lowest 
PaCO2 was 37 Torr (IQR 31, 43) (4.9 kPa (IQR 4.1, 5.7)) during the first 48 hours of 
ECMO. Two hundred and fifteen (44.4%) patients died.
Hyperoxia
Patients with hyperoxia were more likely to have a cardiac indication for ECMO, receive VA 
ECMO, have an acute diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (acquired, congenital or 
arrhythmia), have an acute diagnosis of immune dysfunction, and receive cardiopulmonary 
bypass and/or an operative procedure in the 24 hours prior to ECMO than patients without 
hyperoxia (Table 1). Patients with hyperoxia were less likely to have meconium aspiration 
syndrome or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn than patients without 
hyperoxia. Baseline OI was lower, and pH was higher in patients with hyperoxia compared 
to those without hyperoxia. Average ECMO blood flow rate in the first 48 hours of ECMO 
was higher in patients with hyperoxia than those without hyperoxia (106 [88, 127]

mL/kg/min vs. 101 [80, 118] mL/kg/min, p=0.039). Hyperoxia was also associated with 
clinical site.
Patients with hyperoxia had higher mortality than patients without hyperoxia, and shorter 
durations of ECMO and ICU stay (Table 2). The shorter durations were not related to early 
death on ECMO for hyperoxic patients (Supplemental Digital Content 1). Among survivors, 
functional status at hospital discharge did not differ between those with and without 
hyperoxia.
Hypocapnia
Patients with hypocapnia were more likely to be neonates, receive ECPR, and have an acute 
diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (congenital or arrhythmia) (Table 1). Patients with 
hypocapnia were less likely to be White or have an acute diagnosis of pneumonia or 
bronchiolitis than those without hypocapnia. Body weight and baseline OI were lower, and 
baseline pH higher in patients with hypocapnia compared to those without hypocapnia. 
Hypocapnia was also associated with clinical site.
Patients with hypocapnia were more likely to have a neurologic event and hepatic 
dysfunction than patients without hypocapnia (Table 2). Patients with hypocapnia had 
shorter duration of ECMO. Mortality did not differ between patients with and without 
hypocapnia, nor did functional status at hospital discharge among survivors.
Mortality
Patient factors associated with in-hospital mortality on univariable analyses (p<0.2 and less 
than 10% missing data) included the highest PaO2 and lactate, and lowest pH in the first 48 
hours of ECMO, mode of ECMO, cardiovascular disease (congenital), pneumonia or 
bronchiolitis, meconium aspiration syndrome, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, persistent 
pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, renal failure, neurologic condition, congenital 
anomaly or chromosomal defect, cardiopulmonary bypass and/or operative procedures in the 
24 hours prior to ECMO, age, indication for ECMO, and average ECMO blood flow rate in 
the first 48 hours of ECMO (Supplemental Digital Content 2). Using multivariable analysis, 
factors independently associated with increased mortality included highest PaO2 and highest 
blood lactate concentration in the first 48 hours of ECMO, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, 
and being a preterm neonate (Table 3; also see Supplemental Digital Content 3). Factors 
independently associated with lower mortality included meconium aspiration syndrome.
DISCUSSION
Our findings suggest that hyperoxia is common during pediatric ECMO and independently 
associated with increased in-hospital mortality. The frequency of hyperoxia observed in our 
study is similar to that reported in a smaller retrospective cohort of infants treated with VA 
ECMO after congenital heart disease surgery (18). This prior study found 78% of infants 
had hyperoxia (PaO2 >193 Torr) in the first 48 hours of ECMO. Our finding of higher in-
hospital mortality among hyperoxic ECMO patients is also consistent with the prior study’s 
finding of higher 30-day post-operative mortality (18). A recent adult ECMO study also 
found a relationship between moderate hyperoxia (PaO2 101–300 Torr) and mortality (30).

The pathophysiology underlying the increase in mortality among ECMO patients with 
hyperoxia may be related to increased generation of ROS after a period of tissue ischemia 
(7, 8). During reperfusion, ROS pathologically activate neutrophils and platelets (7). 
Activated neutrophils display increased adhesion to damaged endothelium causing 
microvascular blockage and induce the production and release of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines. Activated platelets display increased aggregation and potential for thrombosis. 
Despite these known effects, we did not find a significant association between hyperoxia and 
thrombosis, bleeding, neurologic events, hepatic dysfunction or renal failure. The lack of 
association suggests direct injury to these organs from hyperoxia is not responsible for the 
increased mortality, or that our global assessments of organ dysfunction are inadequate to 
detect these cellular and microvascular changes. Another possibility is that hyperoxia during 
ECMO may be a marker of poor cardiac output making the relative oxygen delivery from 
the ECMO circuit high. Thus, increased mortality with hyperoxia could be due to 
myocardial failure with relatively little patient cardiac output to mix with the highly 
oxygenated circuit flow. Average ECMO blood flow in the first 48 hours of ECMO was 
somewhat higher in hyperoxic than non-hyperoxic patients; however, ECMO blood flow was 
not an independent predictor of mortality in our multivariable model.
Hyperoxic patients had a shorter duration of ECMO and ICU stay than non-hyperoxic 
patients. These findings were not due to early death on ECMO for hyperoxic patients. The 
shorter durations could be related to the higher number of patients in the hyperoxia group 
who were placed on VA ECMO for a cardiac indication. Cardiovascular patients in general 
have shorter ECMO runs than respiratory failure patients (31). Functional status at hospital 
discharge did not differ among survivors with and without hyperoxia. This finding may be 
due to a lack of pre-illness functional status assessment, and thus, our inability to adjust 
discharge functional status for pre-existing disabilities.
Hypocapnia occurred less often in our study than hyperoxia, and although associated with 
complications, it was not associated with mortality or functional status among survivors. 
Patients with hypocapnia were more likely to have a neurologic event. Hypocapnia may 
cause cerebral vasoconstriction, decreased cerebral blood flow and increased cerebral 
ischemia (17). ECMO itself alters cerebral autoregulation (32) and cerebral blood flow 
velocity (33), and the degree of decline in PaCO2 at initiation of ECMO has been associated 
with mortality (34). Patients with hypocapnia were also more likely to develop hepatic 
dysfunction. The cellular and biochemical derangements that occur during hepatic ischemia-
reperfusion injury are diverse and complex (35). Whether the association between 
hypocapnia and hepatic dysfunction observed in our study represents a unique effect of 
hypocapnia on the liver or a spurious finding is unknown.
Our findings differ from prior studies demonstrating an association between hypocapnia and 
mortality after pediatric cardiac arrest and traumatic brain injury (12, 13). In these 
conditions, hypocapnia is produced by excessive mechanical ventilation rather than by the 
sweep gas in the ECMO circuit. Increased intrathoracic pressure from mechanical 
ventilation may decrease venous return and coronary perfusion pressure contributing to 
higher mortality (17, 36). Carbon dioxide is relatively easy to clear on ECMO and the “cost” 
of clearance may be less than for mechanically ventilated patients. Overall, our findings 
Cashen et al.

suggest both hyperoxia and hypocapnia be avoided during pediatric ECMO. This may be 
accomplished by judicious use of oxygen and careful attention to sweep gas flow rate to 
blood flow rate ratio.
Other patient factors independently associated with increased mortality in our study included 
higher blood lactate concentration in the first 48 hours of ECMO, congenital diaphragmatic 
hernia, and being a preterm neonate. Meconium aspiration was independently associated 
with decreased mortality. These findings are consistent with previous reports (31, 37).
Strengths of this study include the multisite design and daily prospective data collection. 
Limitations include recording only the blood gas values closest to 7 AM rather than all 
values and the lack of a standardized protocol for ECMO across all sites. Our definitions of 
hyperoxia and hypocapnia were based on dichotomized values described in other studies (7, 
26, 27) and do not account for the degree or duration of hyperoxia or hypocapnia. Thus, 
exact levels of PaO2 and PaCO2 or the duration of exposure associated with harm cannot be 
determined. Three patients had no blood gas values collected in the first 48 hours of ECMO; 
whether clinicians did not obtain blood gases or whether the research coordinators missed 
recording their values is unknown. Although many variables were evaluated, potential 
unmeasured confounders exist. Importantly, this is an observational study and the 
associations observed do not infer causation. For example, neurologic complications during 
ECMO are multifactorial, and not entirely caused by blood gas derangements.
CONCLUSIONS
Hyperoxia is common during pediatric ECMO and associated with mortality. Hypocapnia 
occurs less often and is associated with complications but not mortality. Judicious use of 
oxygen and avoidance of hyperoxia and hypocapnia may be indicated.
