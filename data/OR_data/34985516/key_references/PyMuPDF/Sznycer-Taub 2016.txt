Objectives: Patients who require venoarterial extracorporeal mem-
brane oxygenation because of cardiac failure frequently have 
supranormal blood oxygen tensions (hyperoxia). Recent stud-
ies have suggested worse outcomes in patients with hyperoxia 
after resuscitation from cardiac or respiratory arrests, presumably 
because of oxidative stress. There are limited data regarding the 
effect of hyperoxia on outcomes in pediatric patients on venoarte-
rial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
Design: Retrospective chart review.
Setting: Pediatric cardiothoracic ICU.
Patients: Cardiac surgery patients less than 1 year old requiring 
venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the postop-
erative period from 2007 to 2013.
Measurements and Main Results: In 93 infants (median time on extra-
corporeal membrane oxygenation, 5 d), mortality at 30 days post 
surgery (primary outcome) was 38%. Using a receiver operating 
characteristic curve, a mean Pao2 of 193 mm Hg in the first 48 hours 
of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was determined to have 
good discriminatory ability with regard to 30-day mortality. Univariate 
analysis identified a mean Pao2 greater than 193 mm Hg (p = 0.001), 
longer cardiopulmonary bypass times (p = 0.09), longer duration 
of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (p < 0.0001), and higher 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation pump flows (p = 0.052) as 
possible risk factors for 30-day mortality. In multivariable analysis 
controlling for the variables listed above, a mean Pao2 greater 
than 193 mm Hg remained an independent risk factor for mortality 
(p = 0.03). In addition, a mean Pao2 greater than 193 mm Hg was 
associated with the need for renal dialysis (p = 0.02) but not with 
neurologic injury (p = 0.41) during the hospitalization.
Conclusions: In infants with congenital heart disease who are 
placed on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
postoperatively, hyperoxia (defined as a mean Pao2 > 193 mm Hg 
in the first 48 hr of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) was an 
independent risk factor for 30-day mortality after surgery. Future 
studies are needed to delineate the causative or associative role 
of hyperoxia with outcomes, especially in children with baseline 
cyanosis who may be more susceptible to the effects of oxidative 
stress. (Pediatr Crit Care Med 2016; 17:350–358)

T
he use of mechanical circulatory support after congenital 
heart surgery in the form of extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation (ECMO) is estimated to occur after 3–5% 
of all surgeries, and the overall mortality for patients is approxi-
mately 40–65% (1–3). Common indications for the use of ECMO 
postoperatively include failure to wean from cardiopulmonary 
bypass due to myocardial dysfunction, low cardiac output state, 
cardiac or respiratory arrest, pulmonary hypertension, or shunt 
occlusion. Postoperative patients are most often supported with 
venoarterial ECMO (VA-ECMO) where deoxygenated blood is 
removed from the venous side of the circulation and oxygenated 
via the oxygenator resulting in highly oxygenated blood (Pao2, 
> 400 mm Hg) returned directly to the arterial side of the cir-
culation. The myocardium (via the coronary arteries) and other 
organs such as the brain, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract 
are, thus, exposed to these high levels of oxygen (hyperoxia).
Potential negative effects of hyperoxia include the genera-
tion of reactive oxygen species that leads to increased oxidative 
stress and cellular damage as well as activation of neutrophils 
and platelets leading to an exaggerated inflammatory and

thrombotic cascade (4). The effect of hyperoxia has been exten-
sively studied in other clinical situations such as after resuscita-
tion from cardiac arrest (5–10) or perinatal asphyxia (11, 12) 
and after myocardial infarctions (13). Furthermore, in cyanotic 
pediatric patients with congenital heart disease, decreasing the 
amount of oxygen in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit to 
match the patient’s preoperative Pao2 has been shown to lead 
less end-organ damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress 
compared with exposing the patients to Pao2 values between 
150 and 200 mm Hg (14, 15).
Given the concern that hyperoxia may be harmful to patients 
while on ECMO and the lack of data within this area, we aimed 
to examine the potential effect of hyperoxia on infants who 
were placed onto VA-ECMO after cardiac surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A retrospective chart review of all infants was performed  
(< 1 yr old) who were placed onto VA-ECMO after surgery 
for congenital heart disease from July 1, 2007, to June 30, 
2013, at the University of Michigan. After study approval from 
the Institutional Review Board, the internal ECMO registry 
was reviewed and patients who met the inclusion criteria 
were identified. Patients who were on ECMO preoperatively, 
patients who were placed on ECMO greater than 30 days post-
operatively, and patients who were supported on ECMO less 
than 24 hours were excluded from the analysis. Electronic 
charts and the internal congenital heart surgery database 
were reviewed, and demographic and clinical data were col-
lected. Surgical procedures were stratified based on complex-
ity per the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the European 
Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (STAT) Mortality 
Categories (16). If available, the first arterial blood gas prior 
to cannulation for ECMO was collected (if a patient was can-
nulated in the operating room, then the blood gas prior to 
surgery was included). In addition, all arterial blood gases in 
the first 48 hours after cannulation for ECMO were also col-
lected. If individual patients were placed on ECMO multiple 
times in their life or hospitalization, only data from the first 
ECMO cannulation were collected.
The primary outcome was 30-day mortality after the ini-
tial surgery. Secondary outcomes included ICU length of stay, 
hospital length of stay, in-hospital mortality, need for dialysis, 
and neurologic injury during the hospitalization (defined as 
seizure, stroke, or intracranial hemorrhage). If available, trans-
thoracic echocardiograms performed within the first 48 hours 
of cannulation on to ECMO were reviewed by an independent 
physician specialized in echocardiography (S.T.O.) to evaluate 
the amount of ventricular dysfunction.
With regard to ECMO support, from July 2007 to June 
2010, silicone oxygenators from Medtronic (Minneapolis, 
MN) were used. Starting in July 2010, the ECMO circuits used 
Quadrox oxygenators from Maquet (Wayne, NJ). From July 
2007 to March 2010, ECMO flows were provided by roller 
pumps. Starting in April 2010, ECMO flow was provided by 
centrifugal pumps. Ventilator settings were placed at “rest set-
tings” to avoid barotrauma with an Fio2 of 21%. In patients 
with systemic to pulmonary artery shunts, it is standard prac-
tice to leave the shunt patent in most cases unless there are sig-
nificant issues with an elevated ratio of pulmonary to systemic 
blood flow.
Descriptive statistics are reported as frequency with per-
centage for categorical variables and median with interquartile 
range (IQR) for continuous variables. The maximum, median, 
and mean Pao2 values in the first 48 hours on ECMO were cal-
culated for each patient. Using receiver operating characteris-
tic (ROC) curves, the area under the curves (AUCs) of each of 
three Pao2 metrics were compared to determine the most pre-
dictive metric of Pao2 for the primary outcome. The optimal 
cutoff of the selected metric of Pao2 in the first 48 hours was 
then determined as the best combination of sensitivity and 
specificity for significant discrimination of the primary out-
come from the ROC curve. To ascertain the predictive ability 
of the optimal cutoff, sensitivity, specificity, positive predic-
tive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were 
calculated for the overall cohort and for subgroups of neo-
nates and patients who underwent a Norwood procedure with 
systemic to pulmonary artery shunt placement. Patient and 
clinical characteristics were compared between patients based 
on the primary outcome, using chi-square test or Fisher exact 
test, as appropriate, for the categorical variables and Wilcoxon 
signed rank test for continuous variables. Variables associated 
with 30-day mortality in the univariate analysis (p < 0.1) were 
included in the multivariable model to evaluate independent 
associations of possible risk factors with 30-day mortality. 
Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and their 95% CIs were 
estimated using logistic regression. Finally, similar univari-
ate comparisons between patients with mean Pao2 values in 
the first 48 hours above and below the optimal cutoff were 
made in patient and clinical characteristics and the secondary 
outcomes. All analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). p value less than 0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 93 patients were included in the study. Patient char-
acteristics are presented in Table 1. The median age at the time 
of surgery was 7 days, and 75% were neonates. Eighty-five 
percent of the patients had STAT scores of 4 or 5, and most 
(88%) had preoperative cyanotic heart disease. Forty-five per-
cent of patients were cannulated on to ECMO in the operating 
room, and 66% of patients were placed on to ECMO less than  
24 hours after surgery. The median length of time on ECMO 
was 5 days. The most common indication for ECMO was fail-
ure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass in the operating 
room (47%), and the majority of patients (86%) were cannu-
lated via the chest. Ten patients had the sweep gas intentionally 
blended to achieve lower arterial oxygen tensions during the 
study period. The median of the lowest Fio2 of the sweep gas 
in the first 48 hours in these patients was 40% (IQR, 32.5–40). 
There was 38% mortality at 30 days after surgery and 49% in-
hospital mortality. The median ICU length of stay was 22 days 
(IQR, 16–44). Thirty-eight percent of patients required renal

dialysis, and 42% had evidence of neurologic injury (stroke, 
seizures, or intracranial hemorrhage).
Arterial blood gases prior to cannulation for ECMO were 
available in 83 patients. The median pH was 7.35 (IQR, 7.19–
7.39), Pao2 was 40.0 mm Hg (IQR, 32.8–62.2), and lactate was 
3.5 mmol/L (IQR, 1.3–13.0).
The median number of arterial blood gas measurements in 
the first 48 hours of ECMO was 15 (range, 4–28) across the entire 
cohort. Using ROC curves, the mean Pao2 in the first 48 hours 
was the most predictive metric for mortality 30 days after surgery 
(AUC, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54–0.76) compared with other Pao2 met-
rics (AUC, 0.58 and 0.61 in maximum and median Pao2, respec-
tively). A mean Pao2 of 193 mm Hg in the first 48 hours showed a 
good discrimination between the outcomes, with a sensitivity of 
97%, specificity of 33%, PPV of 47%, and NPV of 95%. Seventy-
three patients (78%) in the cohort had a mean Pao2 greater than 
193 mm Hg in the first 48 hours of ECMO.
The mean Pao2 in the first 48 hours also demonstrated good 
discriminatory abilities in the subgroups: AUC, 0.72 (95% CI, 
0.60–0.84) in neonates and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.54–0.89) in patients 
who underwent a Norwood procedure with a systemic to pul-
monary artery shunt. In neonates, a mean Pao2 of 193 mm Hg 
had a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 37%, and an NPV of 
100%, whereas in patients who underwent a Norwood proce-
dure, the cutoff had a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 50%, 
and an NPV of 100%. The distribution of the mean Pao2 in the 
first 48 hours with regard to the primary outcome is shown in 
Figure 1 for the overall cohort and the subgroups.
In univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with 
mortality 30 days after surgery included longer duration on 
ECMO (p < 0.0001) and a mean Pao2 in the first 48 hours of 
greater than 193 mm Hg (p = 0.001) (Table 1). With exclusion 
of the patients who had the sweep gas blended, a mean Pao2 
greater than 193 mm Hg was still significantly associated with 
increased 30-day mortality (p = 0.001). Longer cardiopulmo-
nary bypass times and higher minimum ECMO pump flows in 
the first 48 hours trended toward a significant association with 
30-day mortality (p = 0.09 and 0.052, respectively).

In multivariable analysis, a mean Pao2 in the first 48 hours 
greater than 193 mm Hg and longer duration on ECMO 
remained independently associated with 30-day mortality 
(Table 2).
The entire patient cohort was stratified by a mean Pao2 
of 193 mm Hg in the first 48 hours, and patient and clinical 
characteristics were compared (Table 3). Factors significantly 
associated with a mean Pao2 in the first 48 hours greater 
than 193 mm Hg included longer cardiopulmonary bypass  
(p = 0.02) and aortic cross-clamp times (p = 0.01), longer dura-
tion on ECMO (p < 0.0001), and higher ECMO pump flows. 
Ventricular function (normal or mildly depressed vs mod-
erately or severely depressed) on an echocardiogram within  
48 hours of cannulation was not associated with mean Pao2 
values (p = 0.19).
In terms of end-organ disease, the prevalence of renal dialy-
sis (p = 0.02) but not neurologic injury (p = 0.41) was sig-
nificantly higher in the patients with a mean Pao2 greater than 
193 mm Hg (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In infants with congenital heart disease who are placed on VA-
ECMO in the postoperative setting, hyperoxia (defined in this 
study as a mean Pao2 > 193 mm Hg in the first 48 hr of ECMO) 
was an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality. To our 
knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the potential 
effects of hyperoxia on patients supported on ECMO. In this 
study, we aimed to choose a narrow subset of patients given 
the vast heterogeneity of clinical and surgical characteristics of 
patients who are placed on ECMO and therefore the multiple 
confounders that could contribute to outcomes. The patients 
in this cohort are all infants who had cardiac surgery requiring 
cardiopulmonary bypass for repair of congenital heart lesions. 
We excluded patients without congenital heart disease or those 
that were placed onto ECMO outside of the postoperative set-
ting to limit confounders given that cardiopulmonary bypass 
in infants is known to cause a significant systemic inflamma-
tory response (17).
Overall, the majority of the patients in the cohort were neo-
nates, and approximately a third of the patients underwent a 
Norwood arch reconstruction with a systemic to pulmonary 
artery shunt. These factors in addition to the fact that the 
majority of patients had a STAT mortality score of 4 or 5 indi-
cate that the cohort, as expected, is a high-risk patient group. 
Longer duration on ECMO was found to be a risk factor for 
mortality after congenital heart surgery, which is similar to 
previously published data (18, 19).
There has been a considerable amount of interest recently 
in the potential effects of hyperoxia during and after periods 
of tissue ischemia. The introduction of high amounts of oxy-
gen to previously ischemic tissues leads to the generation of 
reactive oxygen species and activation of inflammatory path-
ways via cytokines (20). Reactive oxygen species lead to lipid 
peroxidation and protein changes, which cause cell injury via 
direct damage or apoptosis (21). The effect may be even more 
pronounced in pediatric patients as neonates, and infants are 
known to have immature antioxidant defenses and thus may be 
more susceptible to the reactive oxygen species (22). In addi-
tion, the reactive oxygen species can activate neutrophils and 
platelets leading to an exaggerated inflammatory and throm-
botic response (4), which could theoretically increase the risk 
of complications on ECMO.
A review of the current literature indicates that across a 
wide variety of clinical scenarios and situations, the effect of 
hyperoxia is unclear. After resuscitation from cardiac arrests, 
hyperoxia in adults has been associated with increased risk of 
mortality (9, 23). On the other hand, supplemental oxygen 
therapy after myocardial infarctions was not shown to have

any clinically apparent effect (13). In pediatric patients, the 
data are mixed as hyperoxia has been shown to be both associ-
ated (6, 8) and not associated with increased risk of mortality 
(5, 7) after cardiac arrests. In neonates with asphyxia, hyper-
oxia was associated with increased mortality and risk of brain 
injury (11, 12). Finally, in children undergoing cardiac surgery 
to repair congenital heart lesions (which often necessitates a 
period of tissue hypoxia during cardioplegic arrest of the heart 
or during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest), patients on 
cardiopulmonary bypass who were exposed to hyperoxia had 
increased evidence of end-organ damage, oxidative stress, and 
inflammation (14, 15).
There are also limited data to suggest that hyperoxia may 
be beneficial in certain situations. In animal models, hyperoxia 
after cardiac arrest was associated with improved myocardial 
function (24) and also shown to be neuroprotective in cere-
bral ischemia (25). Early data in human subjects showed that 
selective perfusion of coronary arteries with a hyperoxemic 
solution resulted in improved left ventricular function (26); 
however, subsequent studies have failed to show any signifi-
cant effect (27).
As a result of the data suggesting the negative effects of 
hyperoxia, there has been considerable interest in modifying 
oxygen exposure to patients. Current resuscitation guidelines 
in pediatrics and adults recommend titration of supplemental 
oxygen after a cardiac arrest (28, 29). In patients supported on 
VA-ECMO, clinicians can titrate (or blend) the oxygen con-
tent of the sweep gas of the oxygenator to achieve more “physi-
ologic” Pao2 levels. However, the practice is not universal. Our 
group conducted an informal survey of other pediatric cardiac 
ICUs and found that two-thirds of units are titrating to goal 
Pao2 levels, whereas the other third maintain elevated Pao2 lev-
els. In our study, only a minority (11%) of patients had the 
sweep gas blended (likely at supervising physician discretion) 
at the end of the time period of the chart review. With both 
inclusion and exclusion of this group of patients, a mean Pao2 
greater than 193 mm Hg was associated with increased 30-day 
mortality.
There are other factors that can contribute to changes in the 
arterial oxygen tension in patients supported on VA-ECMO. 
Rarely, mechanical issues with the oxygenator can lower the 
Pao2 values. In addition, oxygen tension of blood ejected from 
the systemic ventricle and the ratio of mixing of blood from 
the systemic ventricle and the arterial ECMO cannula can 
affect the overall arterial (and hence end organ) oxygen ten-
sion. Pulmonary venous desaturation from lung disease (com-
mon in postoperative patients on ECMO) or mixing at the 
atrial and/or ventricular levels may cause relatively decreased 
oxygen tension of the blood ejected from the systemic ventricle 
in relation to blood returning from the arterial cannula. Most 
patients in our study were cannulated for ECMO in the post-
operative setting due to low cardiac output or failure to wean 
from cardiopulmonary bypass and therefore likely had some 
element of ventricular dysfunction. One could hypothesize 
that a patient with better ventricular function would, there-
fore, eject more blood that has a relatively lower oxygen ten-
sion, thus mixing with the highly oxygenated blood from the 
aortic cannula and leading to overall decreased oxygen tension. 
However, in this study, when we analyzed available echocar-
diograms in the first 48 hours after ECMO cannulation, worse 
ventricular function was not found to be significantly associ-
ated with a higher mean Pao2.
Another important factor is ECMO pump flow as higher 
flows would presumably decrease the amount of pulmonary 
venous return and therefore decrease preload to the systemic 
ventricle. This could lead to decreased ejection of the “deoxy-
genated” blood into the aorta. Interestingly, when adjusting for 
ECMO pump flow and other factors, a mean Pao2 greater than 
193 mm Hg was still associated with increased risk of 30-day 
mortality, suggesting that the association is not dependent 
on the requirement for increased ECMO support. In addi-
tion, although we observed that higher ECMO pump flows

trended toward a significant association with mortality in the 
univariate analysis and patients with a higher average Pao2 had 
significantly higher pump flows, higher ECMO pumps flows 
were not an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality in 
the multivariable analysis. Thus, there is some suggestion from 
this study that elevated Pao2 levels may have a causative (due to 
reactive oxygen species or other mechanisms) effect on clini-
cal outcome versus simply being associative due to improved 
clinical parameters. Although further studies are required to 
delineate these phenomena, the results of this study showed 
that hyperoxia has a very high sensitivity and NPV for mortal-
ity. As shown in the results, there were very few patients who 
did not survive to 30 days after surgery with a mean Pao2 less 
than 193 mm Hg.
Secondary outcomes, such as the need for dialysis or neu-
rologic injury, were investigated to evaluate for potential 
end-organ injury due to hyperoxia. There was no statistical 
difference in terms of neurologic injury (seizures, intracranial 
hemorrhage, or strokes). However, only a limited number of 
patients in the cohort had brain MRI, which is considered to 
be the standard evaluation of white-matter brain injury. Future 
studies would be helpful to further evaluate brain matter 
injury and neurodevelopmental outcomes of patients exposed 
to hyperoxia while on ECMO.
The data did suggest that there was an increased risk for 
the need for renal replacement therapy in those patients with 
a mean Pao2 greater than 193 mm Hg. Previous studies have 
also indicated that renal failure is a risk factor for death while 
on ECMO (18). As discussed above, it is possible that the need 
for dialysis could be due to the negative effects of hyperoxia 
with generation of reactive oxygen species leading to worsen-
ing renal failure. However, it is also possible that the need for 
dialysis was simply a marker of a more critically ill patient with 
worse ventricular function and the need for higher ECMO 
pump flows although these variables were not seen as indepen-
dent risk factors.
Limitations of this study include the fact that it was a ret-
rospective chart review performed at a single center and that 
there may have been other important clinical variables that 
could not be measured in a retrospective manner. Specifically, 
data were not available or collected with regard to the total 
oxygen delivery such as specific ventilator settings and the 
variation in hemoglobin of each patient. In addition, variation 
among individual intensivists with regard to clinical practice 
of patients on ECMO may have contributed to confounding 
data. Finally, due to the retrospective nature of the data collec-
tion, advanced data analysis using longitudinal mixed model-
ing to further define the relationship between Pao2 values and 
outcomes could not be performed.
CONCLUSIONS
In the postoperative period, a mean Pao2 greater than 193 mm 
Hg while on ECMO was an independent risk factor for mor-
tality in infants with congenital heart disease. The results of 
the study indicate that not only are future prospective stud-
ies necessary to investigate the effect of hyperoxia while on 
ECMO but also that a change of practice in management of 
these patients in many centers may be prudent. In addition, 
we would propose that hyperoxia on ECMO may be used 
as a tool for clinicians to prognosticate potential ventricular 
recovery and the likelihood of survival after ECMO decannu-
lation, which may influence decisions regarding further inter-
vention or institution of long-term mechanical support (i.e., 
ventricular assist devices).
