ABSTRACT
Objective: Hyperoxia is associated with adverse outcome in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study 
explored differences in patient classification of oxygen exposure by PaO2 cutoff and cumulative area- 
under-the-curve (AUC) analysis.
Methods: Retrospective, explorative study including children (<18 years) with accidental severe TBI 
(2002–2015). Oxygen exposure analysis used three PaO2 cutoff values and four PaO2 AUC categories 
during the first 24 hours of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission.
Results: Seventy-one patients were included (median age 8.9 years [IQR 4.6–12.9]), mortality 18.3% 
(n = 13). Patient hyperoxia classification differed depending on PaO2 cutoff vs AUC analysis: 52% vs. 
26%, respectively, were classified in the highest hyperoxia category. Eleven patients (17%) classified as 
‘intermediate oxygen exposure’ based on cumulative PaO2 analysis whereby they did not exceed the 
200 mmHg PaO2 cutoff threshold. Patient classification variability was reflected by Pearson correlation 
coefficient of 0.40 (p-value 0.001).
Conclusions: Hyperoxia classification in pediatric severe TBI during the first 24 hours of PICU admission 
differed depending on PaO2 cutoff or cumulative AUC analysis. We consider PaO2 cumulative (AUC) better 
approximates (patho-)physiological circumstances due to its time- and dose-dependent approach. 
Prospective studies exploring the association between cumulative PaO2, physiological parameters (e.g. 
ICP, PbtO2) and outcome are warranted as different patient classifications of oxygen exposure influences 
how its relationship to outcome is interpreted.

Introduction
It is well known that hypoxemia is associated with worse out­
come in TBI (1–4). The influence of hyperoxia on outcome 
remains controversial. Suggested mechanisms of potential nega­
tive effects include cerebral vasoconstriction in a similar manner 
as hypocarbia, oxidative stress and inflammation (2,5–7).
Most studies investigating hyperoxia and outcome in TBI and 
other patient groups used (arbitrary) cutoff values for hyperoxia 
such as 200, 250 or 300 mmHg, respectively (2,8–11). Whether the 
analysis of different cutoff values adequately approximates oxygen 
exposure is questionable due to the multifactorial and dynamic 
nature of oxygen physiology in combination with continuous 
supplemental oxygen exposure in the majority of cases. A study 
in pediatric post-cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) patients 
by van Zellem et al. introduced a new innovative method in 
defining and measuring hyperoxia and oxygen exposure: the 
cumulative analysis using the area-under-the-curve (AUC) PaO2 
calculation, which is a commonly used approach to estimate drug 
exposure in pharmacological studies (12–14). Although each 
method of oxygen exposure analysis has its limitations, our 
hypothesis is that the longitudinal, cumulative approach better 
addresses the (patho-)physiology of cerebral hyperoxia as it takes 
time- and dose-dependent factors into account (15).
The aim of our study was to compare the hyperoxia classifica­
tion of pediatric severe traumatic brain injury patients during the 
first 24 hours of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission 
by using conventional PaO2 cutoff analysis and area-under-the- 
curve (AUC) PaO2 cumulative analysis. The rationale being that 
patient classification is crucial to how we subsequently associate 
hyperoxia to outcome measures, such as morbidity and mortality.
Material and methods
Study design and setting
This is a retrospective observational study with exploratory aims. 
The study was performed at PICU of the Erasmus MC – Sophia 
Children’s Hospital, a tertiary-care hospital providing regional 
pediatric health care for the southwest of The Netherlands (esti­
mated regional population of 4.2 million inhabitants). This popu­
lation is a representative sample of the Dutch population. Waiver 
of consent was granted by the ethical review board of the Erasmus 
MC due to the noninvasive matter of the study (MEC 2015–583).

Study aim
The aim of this observational study was to explore two meth­
ods of analyzing oxygen exposure (cutoff vs. cumulative AUC 
PaO2) per patient. The importance of comparing these two 
methods is to ascertain if the type of analysis leads to differ­
ences in hyperoxia patient classification.
Subjects
All children admitted to the PICU of the Erasmus MC – Sophia 
Children’s Hospital with severe TBI between January 2002 and 
July 2015 were evaluated for study eligibility. Inclusion criteria 
were severe TBI defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 
eight or less requiring ICP-monitoring in the PICU and the 
presence of an arterial line for the acquisition of PaO2 values. 
Treatment of severe TBI in our hospital conformed interna­
tional guidelines for acute medical management of severe trau­
matic brain injury (16). Exclusion criteria were non-accidental 
TBI, such as child battering and no arterial line in situ for PaO2 
sampling.
Data collection
Data were derived from ambulance registration forms, electro­
nic medical records and our Patient Data Management System 
(PDMS) and collected for the first 24 hours after the event 
(T = 0). Due to inadequate documentation of the precise time 
of event in the majority of cases, this had to be approximated. 
Therefore, we chose to define T = 0 as the PICU admission 
time. This is deemed a reasonable solution because of a rapid 
response time of medical emergency services in our region with 
relatively little time between the estimated time of event (based 
on ambulance registration forms, ER admission forms) and 
PICU admission (median 1.7 hours, IQR [0.1–22.3]).
The following data were collected (1): basic patient charac­
teristics (e.g., gender, age, PIM3 and PRISM scores) (2), TBI 
characteristics (e.g. etiology, first recorded GCS (at the scene 
or, if unknown, GCS at the Emergency Room) and radiological 
findings), 3) outcome (mortality during PICU admission), 4) 
laboratory values (Arterial Blood Gas (ABG): arterial pH, lac­
tate, PaO2, PaCO2) and 5) values of ICP, Fraction of inspired 
Oxygen (FiO2) and Mean Airway pressure (MAP). The 
Oxygenation Index (OI) was calculated as follows: (FiO2 
x MAP)/PaO2.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as frequencies (%), mean (standard deviation, 
SD) for normally distributed variables or median (interquartile 
range, IQR) for continuous variables that were not normally 
distributed. Correlation between PaO2 max and total PaO2 AUC 
in the first 24 hours of PICU admission was calculated using 
Person correlation coefficient (95% confidence interval). It was 
pre-defined that the correlation was excellent with a coefficient 
above 0.80, good between 0.61 and 0.80; fair to moderate when 
between 0.21 and 0.60; and poor when below 0.20. Univariable 
logistic regression was used to explore the differences in associa­
tion between the two approaches to define hyperoxia and the 
outcome measure ‘mortality.’ A two-sided p-value of ≤0.05 was 
considered statistically significant for all analyses. Data analysis 
was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0.0 (IBM Inc.) and 
GraphPad Prism 8.30 for Windows (Graph-pad Software, Inc.).
Oxygen exposure analysis
The presence of hyperoxia during the first 24 hours of PICU 
admission was investigated using two different methods of 
analyzing PaO2: the traditionally used cutoff value analysis and 
secondly the cumulative analysis of PaO2 using the trapezoidal 
method. Both methods were used in each individual patient 
from the cohort. Subsequently, a comparison was made on 
how patients were categorized dependent on the type of oxygen 
exposure analysis (cutoff vs AUC). No correction of patient- 
specific variables was necessary as comparison of the type of 
analysis was per patient and not patient subgroups.
PaO2 cutoff analysis: Three different cutoff values of hyper­
oxia (>200, >250 and >300 mmHg) were used as proposed in the 
literature (2,8–11). The highest PaO2 value for each individual 
patient was determined for the first 24 hours of PICU admission. 
Patients were categorized in 1 of these 3 cutoff groups based on 
which of the aforementioned cutoff values was surpassed.
PaO2 cumulative area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis: The 
AUC of PaO2 was calculated to determine the cumulative PaO2 
of each patient during the first 24 hours of PICU admission. 
A minimum of four PaO2 measurements within the first 
24 hours was required for this analysis. The actual number of 
available PaO2 samples per patient in this 24-hour time frame 
was dependent on how frequently an arterial blood gas was 
drawn for routine clinical care.
One step of the AUC calculation included a correction for 
the time of PaO2 measurement for patients who did not have 
a 24-hour time period in which PaO2 was measured (e.g. the 
patient died within 24 hours). This resulted in a cumulative 
PaO2 per hour, which was converted into the cumulative PaO2 
by multiplying by 6, 18, or 24, respectively.
Exploratory analyses of cutoff and cumulative PaO2: To 
enable comparison of PaO2 AUC patient classification to PaO2 
cutoff categories, we divided AUC values into the following four 
groups: AUC value <2000, 2001–4000, 4001–6000 and >6000. 
These groups are based on evaluation of individual case analysis 
whereby an AUC value <2000 reflected ‘physiological’ oxygen 
exposure, an AUC value between 2000 and 4000 ‘intermediate’ 
oxygen exposure and AUC values >4000 ‘high’ oxygen exposure. 
The values for PaO2 AUC and PaO2 max are continuous and are 
exploratively compared in univariable regression analyses. In the 
literature PaO2 max is (mostly) used in combination with cutoff 
values, thus creating different hyperoxia categories.
Results
Patient and TBI characteristics
Seventy-one patients met the inclusion criteria for this study 
between the study period of January 2002 and July 2015. The 
median age was 8.9 years [IQR 4.6–12.9] and 51 (72%) patients 
were male. The mortality rate was 18.3% (N = 13) of which 
seven patients (54%) died within 24 hours. The etiologies of 
BRAIN INJURY
959

death were: brain death (n = 6, all of which had an apnea test), 
withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (n = 6) and cardiac 
arrest (n = 1). The cause of the cardiac arrest was unclear and 
postmortem examination did not reveal a specific etiology. 
Withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment because of unfavorable 
neurological prognosis was based on repeated neurological 
examination, brain imaging and electroencephalography. The 
majority of patients had been involved in traffic accidents 
(53%) and displayed multiple injuries on cerebral-computed 
tomography (CT) scan. Table 1 displays the patient character­
istics of the total study cohort.
Oxygen exposure analysis
Figure 1 visually demonstrates the difference in how oxygen 
exposure can be viewed when defined by a single PaO2 cutoff 
value versus PaO2 cumulative value (AUC) for the first 
24 hours of five different patients in our cohort. The individual 
patients have varying PaO2 cumulative (AUC) values (pre­
sented as increasing values from low to high in patient A and 
patient E, respectively). However, this does not mean that 
a single, absolute PaO2 value necessarily crosses a cutoff thresh­
old. Examples of this difference are patients C and D who have 
similar cumulative (AUC) PaO2 values (approx. 3700 each) but 
only patient D crosses the 300 mmHg PaO2 threshold. This 
illustrates how different methods of oxygen analysis might lead 
to different interpretations of oxygen exposure.
Comparison of PaO2 cutoff and PaO2 AUC classification is 
represented in Table 2. This showed heterogeneity in patient 
classification whereby some patients could be categorized as 
both ‘hyperoxic’ and relatively physiological oxygen exposure 
depending on which analysis was used. Furthermore, patients 
classified as ‘intermediate’ oxygen exposure based on PaO2 
AUC cumulative analysis showed a wide distribution over the 
various PaO2 cutoff values. Figure 2 illustrates the variation in 
patient hyperoxia classification based on the type of analysis and 
is underlined by a Pearson’s correlation coefficient for PaO2 
max and PaO2 cumulative AUC of 0.40 (95% CI 0.17–0.58), 
p-value <0.001, which reflects fair to moderate correlation.
Table 3 reflects an exploratory univariable logistic regres­
sion analysis of PaO2 cutoff versus cumulative (AUC) and 
mortality. This yielded a possible association with cumulative 
PaO2 during the first 24 hours of PICU admission (OR 1.059, 
CI 1.005–1.117), p-value 0.032. No association was found with 
the three PaO2 cutoff values or the (continuous) maximum 
PaO2 value.
Discussion
This study compared two different types of oxygen exposure 
analysis (PaO2 cutoff versus cumulative area-under-the-curve 
analysis) and showed major differences in patient classification 
of hyperoxia and in the association between hyperoxia and 
mortality. This is an important finding as it could influence 
our understanding of the relationship between hyperoxia and 
outcome measures and subsequent therapeutic targets we for­
mulate for clinical care.
The importance of improving our understanding of oxygen 
physiology in TBI is emphasized by the established harmful 
effect of hypoxia resulting in international guidelines advocat­
ing brain tissue oxygenation tension (PbtO2) monitoring 
(3,24). However, the effects of hyperoxia remain controversial. 
No formal definition for hyperoxia exists and different modes 
of analysis have been applied leading to reports of both bene­
ficial and adverse effects of hyperoxia in critical illness in 
general and TBI specifically (2,4,8,10,11,18,20,23,25–29). To 
further compound the complexity of this debate, there are 
reports that suggest the timing of arterial hyperoxia, at admis­
sion and during the first 24 hours, could influence outcome 
measures (2,21,30). Potential harmful effects of hyperoxia (e.g. 
oxygen toxicity due to reactive oxygen species and vasocon­
striction) could be accentuated in the (severe) TBI patient due 
to higher susceptibility for inflammation and cardiovascular 
instability thus potentially contributing to increased morbidity 
and mortality (2,5–7).
The majority of studies on hyperoxia and TBI use a single 
value to describe oxygen exposure: either a PaO2 value above

an arbitrary cutoff or a maximum PaO2 value used as 
a continuous value in analysis (2,4,8–11,19,20,25,26,28,31,32). 
However, fluctuations in PaO2 levels are common in critical 
illness and TBI. The biological rationale for considering an 
alternative approach to oxygen exposure analysis other than 
cutoff methodology is that the PaO2 cumulative (AUC) analy­
sis incorporates time- and dose-dependent factors. This could 
yield a more realistic description of overall oxygen exposure in 
comparison to a single cutoff value. In this context, oxygen can 
be seen as one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the 
pre-hospital, emergency room and critical care setting (22,29). 
This could warrant an analytic approach of its exposure similar 
to other pharmacological agents whereby the clinician attempts 
to navigate dosage between the margins of efficacy and safety, 
so-called ‘therapeutic drug monitoring’ (33). Parallels can be 
drawn from pharmacological studies on optimal dosing strate­
gies for antibiotics. Comparison of cutoff versus cumulative

(AUC) methodology in this context has demonstrated that 
cumulative (AUC) analysis could lead to adequate exposure/ 
efficacy for the intended purpose, often at a lower dosage than 
initially calculated, and subsequently with less toxicity than 
dosing schemes based on peak and trough levels alone 
(13,14). Applying the same methodology to evaluate (cumula­
tive) oxygen exposure could improve our understanding of 
oxygen pathophysiology in terms of safety and efficacy 
(12,15,17). Therefore, we found it of interest to explore this 
methodology in pediatric TBI, an especially vulnerable group 
where improved understanding of oxygen physiology may be 
one of the tools to improve overall outcome.
In essence, Figure 1 illustrates the core finding of our study 
where oxygen exposure and subsequent hyperoxia classification 
depended on which analysis method was used. Patient B would be 
classified as ‘high oxygen exposure’ based on the fact that one 
PaO2 value exceeded the cutoff yet the AUC-value is low. On the 
other hand, patients C and D both have an ‘intermediate’ AUC 
value but would be scored differently as far as potential harmful 
oxygen exposure is concerned when classified by cutoff values. 
From a clinical point of view, this might mean that supplemental 
oxygen therapy with PaO2 values consistently on the upper range 
of what is considered normal could be as harmful as a few 
moments with very high values of PaO2 and fits the pharmacolo­
gical concept of a time- and dose-dependent effect of oxygen 
when viewing it as a drug. The visual observations represented 
in Figure 1 were further underlined in Table 2 where the differ­
ences in patient classification for the total cohort became apparent 
and demonstrated the extent of the discrepancy in patient classi­
fication based on the type of analysis. This was also reflected by 
a fair to moderate correlation between maximum PaO2 and 
cumulative PaO2 (Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.40 (95% 
CI 0.17–0.58, p-value < 0.001) in Figure 2.
Awareness of such potentially large differences in patient 
classification secondary to methodology is crucial when 
attempting to associate oxygen exposure to clinical outcome 
measures. Therefore, we explored patient classification based 
on cutoff or cumulative PaO2 analysis to mortality (Table 3) 
and interestingly the cumulative PaO2 of the first 24 hours of 
PICU admission suggested an association with mortality. No 
conclusions can be drawn from this finding given the retro­
spective, small sample size. However, it is of interest given 
previous observations made about oxygen exposure timing 
and outcome measures (21,30,34,35).
There are various limitations that need to be addressed. 
Obviously, a retrospective cohort study with a relatively small 
patient sample size, variable PaO2 sampling and a short time 
frame (first 24 hours of PICU admission) makes it impossible 
to establish the superiority of one method of analysis over the 
other. However, this cohort provided the opportunity to 
explore two methods of oxygen exposure analysis in 
a hypothesis-generating manner.
From a data collection point of view, this study has an 
inclusion period of 24 hours after PICU admission because of 
its explorative nature. This time period does not represent the 
full scope of TBI pathophysiology and in future studies, it 
would be interesting to investigate the entire PICU admission 
period, especially given reports on the timing of arterial hyper­
oxia and outcome (21,30).
When discussing limitations in the AUC method analysis, 
we must acknowledge that the AUC method might not be ideal 
in measuring PaO2 fluctuations. The trapezoidal rule to esti­
mate cumulative PaO2 is commonly used in pharmacokinetic 
research to measure total drug exposure (12). An important 
assumption of calculating the AUC using this trapezoidal rule 
is the predictability of the measured concentrations (such as in 
drugs with a substantial half life time value). This is not the case 
for oxygen and fluctuations in PaO2 levels are common in 
critical illness and TBI, resulting in no pattern or predictability 
in PaO2 levels. Nonetheless, we conclude that the PaO2 cumu­
lative AUC method better captures exposure variability in 
combination with the time- and dose-dependent factors than 
a single PaO2 cutoff approach. Therefore, to optimize the 
granularity of the cumulative PaO2 AUC approach in future 
studies, we advocate standardized, frequent PaO2 sampling. 
Modalities such as transcutaneous PaO2 monitoring might be 
considered for this type of analysis as it would yield high- 
frequency, continuous PaO2 data (36). In general, it must be 
noted, that systemic arterial oxygenation (PaO2) might not be 
an adequate surrogate of regional cerebral oxygenation, such as 
PbtO2. Thus, concomitant PbtO2-monitoring and microdialy­
sis would enable a better understanding in which patient's 
higher supplemental oxygen administration (and subsequent 
PaO2 levels) might be justified, but these modalities are cur­
rently not available in most clinical settings. Therefore, guide­
lines for supplemental oxygen titration on the basis of PaO2 
values would be practical in the clinical context which have 
been defined based on consensus in the most recent manage­
ment guidelines of pediatric severe TBI (16).
TBI pathophysiology is complex, multifactorial and 
dynamic. Our study focuses on only one element in this com­
plex cascade of events. We suggest further prospective studies 
to investigate the context of cumulative PaO2 in relationship to 
other physiological parameters, such as intracranial pressure 
(ICP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) as well as cerebral oxygen 
exposure (PbtO2) and cerebral metabolism (microdialysis). 
This could facilitate establishing which method of oxygen 
exposure analysis might be most appropriate to define hyper­
oxia and its subsequent association with clinical outcome 
measures.
Conclusion
Our study findings are hypothesis-generating and demonstrate 
that patient classification of oxygen exposure shows major 
differences based on the analytic method used (cutoff versus 
cumulative AUC). In our opinion, the cumulative PaO2 (AUC) 
analysis better accounts for the time- and dose-dependent 
nature of supplemental oxygen therapy and deserves further 
exploration using large, prospective data collection to deter­
mine which method of oxygen exposure analysis might be most 
appropriate before attempting to establish potential causality 
between hyperoxia and outcome in (pediatric) TBI and the 
critically ill (pediatric) patient in general. Until more definite 
answers can be provided on the manner to analyze and inter­
pret oxygen exposure in critically ill (pediatric) patients and 
titrate this appropriately to the individual patient, awareness 
that oxygen is the most commonly used ‘drug’ in the PICU,

with the potential for toxicity, should trigger more stringent 
titration of supplemental oxygen where possible to suggested 
PaO2 values (90–100 mmHg) conform the most recent inter­
national guidelines on the management of pediatric traumatic 
brain injury (16).
