### Relationship Between Arterial Partial Oxygen Pressure After Resuscitation From Cardiac Arrest and Mortality in Children

#### Lee P. Ferguson, MBChB; Andrew Durward, FCP; Shane M. Tibby, MSc, MBChB

**_Background—Observational studies in adults have shown a worse outcome associated with hyperoxia after resuscitation_**
from cardiac arrest. Extrapolating from adult data, current pediatric resuscitation guidelines recommend avoiding
hyperoxia. We investigated the relationship between arterial partial oxygen pressure and survival in patients admitted
to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after cardiac arrest.
**_Methods and Results—We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Intensive Care Audit Network_**
(PICANet) database between 2003 and 2010 (n�122 521). Patients aged �16 years with documented cardiac arrest
preceding PICU admission and arterial blood gas analysis taken within 1 hour of PICU admission were included. The
primary outcome measure was death within the PICU. The relationship between postarrest oxygen status and outcome
was modeled with logistic regression, with nonlinearities explored via multivariable fractional polynomials. Covariates
included age, sex, ethnicity, congenital heart disease, out-of-hospital arrest, year, Pediatric Index of Mortality-2 (PIM2)
mortality risk, and organ supportive therapies. Of 1875 patients, 735 (39%) died in PICU. Based on the first arterial gas,
207 patients (11%) had hyperoxia (PaO2 �300 mm Hg) and 448 (24%) had hypoxia (PaO2 �60 mm Hg). We found a
significant nonlinear relationship between PaO2 and PICU mortality. After covariate adjustment, risk of death increased
sharply with increasing hypoxia (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.80–2.21 at PaO2 of 23 mm Hg). There was
also an association with increasing hyperoxia, although not as dramatic as that for hypoxia (odds ratio, 1.25; 95%
confidence interval, 1.17–1.37 at 600 mm Hg). We observed an increasing mortality risk with advancing age, which was
more pronounced in the presence of congenital heart disease.
**_Conclusions—Both severe hypoxia and, to a lesser extent, hyperoxia are associated with an increased risk of death after_**
PICU admission after cardiac arrest. (Circulation. 2012;126:335-342.)

with achievement of return of circulation, many children die
in subsequent days, with death usually attributed to neurological injury or cardiovascular dysfunction.[1] Recent research
has focused on therapeutic strategies to attenuate the post–
cardiac arrest syndrome that accompanies postischemic reperfusion.[4] Evidence from animal models indicates postischemic hyperoxia promotes free radical–generated injury[5] and
that oxidative stress contributes to both neurological injury[6]
and cardiac dysfunction.[7] In addition, hyperoxia has also been
shown to decrease cardiac output[8] and reduce regional oxygen delivery to both cerebral and coronary vascular beds.[9,10]

##### Clinical Perspective on p 342

The observational studies in adults that have investigated
postresuscitation hyperoxia have reported conflicting find

ings.[11,12] In a multicenter retrospective study of 6326 adults
admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) after nontraumatic
cardiac arrest, the Emergency Medicine Shock Research
Network (EMShockNet) investigators found that exposure to
arterial hyperoxia after resuscitation, based on the first
arterial blood gas after ICU admission, carried an independent risk of in-hospital death. In secondary analysis of this
data set, a dose-dependent relationship in the association
between supranormal oxygen tension and relative risk of
in-hospital mortality was observed.[13] Bellomo et al[12] repeated
the study using a larger data set of 12 108 patients from the
Australian and New Zealand Adult Patient Database. Using
the lowest recorded arterial PaO2 during the first 24 hours of
ICU admission but otherwise similar methodology as the
EMShockNet investigators, they also found increased mortality in both the isolated hypoxemia and hyperoxia groups
compared with normoxia; however, the relationship between

hyperoxia and mortality was weak and no longer achieved
statistical significance after adjustment for illness severity.[12]

Clinical data in the pediatric population are lacking. On the
basis of laboratory and adult clinical data, recent pediatric
resuscitation guidelines recommend avoiding hyperoxia by
reducing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) to the minimum concentration needed to achieve arterial oxygen saturations of 94% to 98% after return of circulation.[14,15] We
undertook this retrospective cohort study to investigate the
relationship between PaO2 and ICU survival in patients
admitted to pediatric intensive care after cardiac arrest.
Specifically, we sought to determine whether early hyperoxia
or hypoxia after return of circulation in children aged �16
years was significantly associated with ICU death after
adjustment for mortality risk. In contrast to the adult studies,
we modeled oxygen status as a continuous, nonlinear variable. Our secondary aim was to investigate whether the
presence of congenital heart disease (a factor associated with
abnormal baseline oxygen saturations and hence PaO2) influenced this relationship.

#### Methods
The study used data from the Pediatric Intensive Care Audit Network
(PICANet) national database. PICANet is coordinated by the Universities of Leeds and Leicester and collects pediatric ICU (PICU)
admission data that include demographics, diagnosis, admission
physiology, and individual patient outcome. PICANet was established in 2001 and now records details of all admissions to 33 PICUs
within the United Kingdom and Ireland (n�122 521 admissions
2003–2010). Rigorous data quality assurance processes are undertaken by the PICANet team to ensure the data set is of high quality.[16]
Efforts include training days to familiarize data entry staff with data
definitions, internal logical consistency and range checks at the point
of data entry, and monthly unit validation visits by a member of the
PICANet team to ensure data are transcribed accurately from the
medical notes.[16] Anonymized data were provided with the approval
of the PICANet Clinical Advisory Group and Steering Group, with
the endorsement of the Pediatric Intensive Care Society. Collection
of personally identifiable data has been approved by the Patient
Information Advisory Group and ethical approval granted by the
Trent Medical Research Ethics Committee.
Patients aged �16 years with an admission diagnosis of cardiac
arrest or who had documented cardiac arrest preceding PICU
admission (defined as absent pulse or requirement for external
cardiac compressions) between 2003 and 2010 were included. We
excluded patients without documented arterial blood gas analysis
within the time period from the first face-to-face contact with a PICU
doctor to 1 hour after admission to the unit and excluded neonates
admitted to PICU after resuscitation in the delivery room.

**Data Collection**
We recorded the following variables: Demographics, cause of
cardiac arrest, location of the arrest (in hospital or out of hospital),
interhospital transfer to PICU, diagnoses associated with PICU
admission (including congenital heart disease), Pediatric Index of
Mortality-2 (PIM2) score,[17] interventions during PICU stay (eg,
vasoactive drug use), and status at PICU discharge (alive or dead).
PIM2 is a mortality risk score calculated via logistic regression from
variables that include (1) circumstances of PICU admission (elective/
unplanned, recovery from surgical procedure, after cardiopulmonary
bypass), (2) 9 key high-risk and 5 low-risk diagnoses, (3) mechanical
ventilation within 1 hour of PICU admission, and (4) first measured
value of 4 physiological variables (systolic blood pressure, pupillary
reaction, base excess in arterial or capillary blood, and ratio of FIO2


**Statistical Analyses**
The primary outcome measure was death within the PICU. We
initially classified oxygen status (based on PaO2 from the first arterial
blood gas obtained within 1 hour of PICU or retrieval team contact)
into 3 groups using the same definition as the adult studies.[11,12]
Hypoxia was defined as PaO2 �60 mm Hg and hyperoxia as PaO2
�300 mm Hg.[11,12] PIM2 was used to estimate mortality risk.[17] Using
a similar approach to Bellomo et al,[12] we calculated an adjusted
PIM2 index of mortality (PIM2_noO2), by expressing the score in
logit form and then removing the oxygen component.
The relationship between oxygen status after arrest and PICU
death was modeled with logistic regression with Stata version12
(StataCorp). Important covariates were identified a priori on the
basis of known relationship to outcome and likely confounding with
the variable of interest, oxygen status.[18] These included year of
admission, age, sex, Asian ethnicity,[19] presence of congenital heart
disease, location of arrest (out of hospital versus in hospital),[20]
interhospital transfer to PICU, PIM2_noO2, and PICU use of
mechanical ventilation, vasoactive intravenous drugs, extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation, and renal replacement therapy. In contrast to
the adult studies, we allowed for oxygen status (and other continuous
variables) to be modeled in a nonlinear manner using multivariable
fractional polynomials (Stata mfp precommand).[21] This avoided the
loss of valuable information from categorizing a continuous variable[22] and provided a means to quantify potentially differential
effects at extremes of oxygen status (for example, risk may rise more
rapidly at extremes of hypoxia compared with hyperoxia). Extreme
values for PaO2 were truncated at 23 and 600 mm Hg to minimize
excessive leverage from outliers.[18]
Collinearity was screened for by use of variance inflation factors
and the conditioning indices of variance decomposition proportions
(coldiag2 ado file, courtesy of Joseph Harkness). FIO2 was thus not
included in the model because of unacceptable collinearity with both
oxygen status and mechanical ventilation; in addition, this variable
conceivably lies on a continuum with oxygen and death (ie, high
oxygen levels are only possible if a high FIO2 is administered).
Two potentially important interactions were considered a priori
and tested during the model fitting process; both included congenital
heart disease: Heart disease by oxygen status and heart disease by
age. The former interaction was considered to accommodate the fact
that a proportion of congenital heart disease patients have a degree of
hypoxia as their “normal” status, because of anatomic shunts, and the
second to allow for the possibility that age may have a differential
effect on mortality risk in this group compared with children without
congenital heart disease. Inclusion of interactions in the final model
was based on joint likelihood ratio tests with the �[2] distribution (with
appropriate degrees of freedom).[18] Influential observations were
screened via plots of �-model �[2] versus probability and dfit � versus
probability. Overall model fit was assessed via the C statistic and
Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.
The model-fitting procedure outlined above used complete case
data only. We also quantified the impact of missing arterial blood
gases (present in 832 cases, or 31% of the total sample) by refitting
the final model after multiple imputation. Absence of arterial blood
gases affected 2 variables: PIM2_noO2 (because of missing base
excess) and PaO2. Both were imputed using (1) all variables within
the main model, (2) the 18 supplementary diagnostic subcategories
shown in Table 1, and (3) 2 physiological variables (presence of
fixed pupils and systolic blood pressure). Imputation was via
predictive mean matching (to account for nonnormality of missing
variables and to keep the PaO2 within the truncated boundaries of 23
and 600 mm Hg), whereby 20 imputations were performed and then
pooled into a final single set of results by use of Rubin’s combination
rules.[23]

#### Results
There were 2721 patients from 33 PICUs who met the
inclusion criteria. Of these, 31% were excluded: 832 (31%)
had no arterial blood gas measured up to 1 hour after PICU

characteristics are given in Tables 1 and 2 and include the
characteristics of the patients who were excluded without
having undergone arterial blood gas analysis. Compared with
the group with measured PaO2, patients in the excluded
no-gas group were younger (median age 6 versus 11 months)
and had a lower proportion of out-of-hospital arrests (31%
versus 45%) and mechanical ventilation on PICU admission
(72% versus 97%). The PICU mortality rate was 29% in the
no-gas group.
Of 1875 patients undergoing arterial blood gas analysis,
448 (24%) were hypoxic, 207 (11%) were hyperoxic, and
1220 (65%) were normoxic. Hyperoxia was more common
among patients without congenital heart disease, and hypoxia
was more common among those with congenital heart disease
(Figure 1). There were 839 patients (45%) admitted after
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. More than half of all patients
(62%) were transported to the PICU from other hospitals. Of
these, 94% were transported by a specialist retrieval team.
Almost all (97%) patients were mechanically ventilated at
admission to PICU.
Congenital heart disease was more common in the hypoxia
group (30% versus 9% in normoxia and 5% in hyperoxia
groups). Cardiac arrest was of cardiovascular causes in 620
patients (33%) and of respiratory causes in 423 (23%; Table
1). Trauma was an uncommon cause of cardiac arrest (5%).
The cause of the cardiac arrest was unknown at PICU

The median length of PICU stay was 2 days (interquartile
range 1–4) in nonsurvivors and 6 days (interquartile range
3–10) in survivors. Interventions within the PICU are summarized in Table 3. Nearly two thirds of patients received
vasoactive medication by continuous intravenous infusion,
and 69 patients (4%) were supported with extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation. Renal support was used in 147
children (8%). Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration, hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis were used in 5%, 1%, and
3% of patients, respectively.
Overall, 735 (39%) of 1875 children died before PICU
discharge. The unadjusted death rate was slightly higher in
the hyperoxic group (44%) and lower for hypoxic patients
(37%). The multivariable association between PaO2 and
mortality was both nonlinear (the optimal transformation
expressed PaO2 to the powers �2 and �1) and significant
(P�0.01 and 0.04, respectively; Table 4). However, there
was no interaction between PaO2 and congenital heart disease
(model �[2]�6.68, 4 df, P�0.15), and thus, this was excluded
from the final model. Both congenital heart disease and age
were associated with mortality, as was their interaction
(model �[2]�16.44, 4 df, P�0.002).
The complexity of the relationship between PaO2, age, and
congenital heart disease is shown in Figure 2. This demonstrates several important findings. First, mortality risk was
lowest at a PaO2 of �60 to 75 mm Hg. Second, mortality risk
increased with both hypoxia and hyperoxia, although more
steeply for the former. Compared with the optimal PaO2

effect was more pronounced among patients with congenital

after cardiac arrest for a 5-year-old compared with a 1-monthold infant was 2.13 (95% CI, 1.85 to 2.47) among the group
without congenital heart disease; this rose to 9.86 (95% CI,
8.53 to 11.40) for the same age comparison in the congenital
heart disease group.
Finally, 3 other findings were apparent. First, out-ofhospital arrests were nearly twice as likely to result in PICU
death (odds ratio, 1.97; P�0.0001). Second, patients undergoing interhospital transfer (typically, this was because of
transfer from the presenting district hospital to the tertiary
PICU) were at increased risk of death (odds ratio, 1.40;
_P�0.008). Finally, there was a trend toward a 5% year-on-_
year reduction in adjusted mortality risk (odds ratio, 0.95;
_P�0.08)._
The model was not appreciably altered after multiple
imputation. Of note, the odds ratios for PaO2 were similar,
changing from 1.17 to 1.11 (�5.5%), and from 0.66 to 0.74
(an increase of 11.5%), respectively. In addition, both imputed odds ratios retained statistical significance: 1.11 (95%

#### Discussion
This is the first study to date to investigate the relationship
between PaO2 and mortality in children after return of
spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest. We have demonstrated that severe hypoxia and, to a lesser extent, hyperoxia,
after return of circulation are associated with an increased
probability of death in children admitted to PICU. We have
also shown an association between survival to PICU discharge after pediatric cardiac arrest and age, in that infants
and younger children are more likely to survive than older
children.
The harmful effect of hypoxia after cerebral injury has
been widely reported,[24,25] and in adults, hypoxemic patients
after cardiac arrest have particularly poor outcomes.[11,12] We
found a sharp rise in odds of death with increasing hypoxemia, which was more pronounced than that shown by 2 adult
studies: Odds ratios of 1.92 (present study) versus 1.3[11] and
1.4.[12] However, direct comparison is difficult because of
likely differences in the study populations: (1) In the adult
studies, hypoxia was defined as either PaO2 �60 mm Hg or a
P/F ratio �300 mm Hg, which results in a higher proportion
of hypoxic patients (74% and 63% versus 24% in the present
study); (2) we have no information about the distribution of
individual PaO2 values within the hypoxia groups; and (3) the
present study estimated hypoxia as a quantitative rather than
a qualitative variable. A somewhat surprising finding was that
the PaO2 risk profile in the present study was not influenced
by congenital heart disease (interaction effect, P�0.15).
However, this may have been caused by limitations in the
database, because we were unable to reliably differentiate
cyanotic from acyanotic congenital heart disease patients.
Although it is important to avoid severe hypoxia, the
present data lend support to the hypothesis that exposure to
hyperoxia after cardiac arrest is detrimental. We found
hyperoxia to be independently associated with increased risk
of ICU mortality after adjustment for a broad range of
covariates. The magnitude of the effect of hyperoxia on
mortality in the present study is similar to that reported
recently by Bellomo et al in adults.[12] They found an odds
ratio of 1.2 (95% CI 1.0–1.5) for hospital mortality in patients


model that incorporated illness severity; however, the significance of this relationship did change depending on the type
of analysis performed.[12] In agreement with Kilgannon and
colleagues,[13] we found that the association between hyperoxia and mortality risk was not limited to extreme oxygen
tension values, and similarly, we observed no single threshold
for harm from hyperoxia. However, the association between
degree of hyperoxia and mortality in the present study was
not as pronounced as that for adults. We demonstrated an
increase in the odds ratio for mortality of �1.12 (because of
the nonlinear relationship; Figure 2) per 100-mm Hg increase
in PaO2, compared with 1.24 in the study by Kilgannon et al.[13]
This is not surprising given the different spectrum of confounders between the adult and pediatric populations.
The present findings are also consistent with laboratory
data demonstrating the deleterious effects of exposure to
100% oxygen after resuscitation from cardiac arrest.[5,6] We
chose to use only the first arterial blood gas taken within 1
hour of contact with the PICU or retrieval team to investigate
the effect of hyperoxia early after reperfusion. Laboratory
data[5,6] and a preliminary clinical study[26] support the concept
of harm from supranormal oxygen tension in the first hour
after return of circulation. It is unknown whether more
prolonged exposure to hyperoxia would increase the risk of
death further. In our model, the optimal PaO2 after cardiac
arrest was 60 to 75 mm Hg. The results of the present study
lend further support to the postulated target arterial oxygen
saturations of 94% to 96% in future clinical trials of controlled titration of FIO2 after return of circulation after cardiac
arrest.[13]
Children may be more at risk of hyperoxia than adults
because of exposure to high FIO2 administration during
transport. In the present study, more than half of the children
admitted to the PICU after resuscitation were transported
from an outside hospital, and almost all (�98%) were
mechanically ventilated. Many portable transport ventilators
are unable to deliver FIO2 below 0.5,[27] and additionally, the
use of hand ventilation with a flow-inflating anesthesia bag
with 100% oxygen further risks exposure to hyperoxia. This
may explain in part the increased risk with interhospital
transfer seen in the present study (odds ratio 1.4).
Age was an important risk factor for death in the present
study cohort. Infants and young children admitted to the
PICU after cardiac arrest were much more likely to survive to

risk and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. This is in agreement
with recent studies of pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest.[2,28]
In contrast, worse outcome has been reported in infants after
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.[3,29] However, most out-ofhospital cardiac arrests in infants occur at home and are not
witnessed, and as a result, return of circulation is less likely
to be attained.[29] The present cohort included only patients
who survived to PICU admission after cardiac arrest. In
patients with return of circulation for �20 minutes after
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, Moler et al[30] found survivor
and nonsurvivor groups to be similar with respect to age. It
has been hypothesized that improved outcome in younger
children relates to the increased compliance of the chest wall,
which results in more effective cerebral and coronary perfusion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.[31]
The present data also demonstrate an interaction between


increase in risk with advancing age was more pronounced in
the setting of congenital heart disease. We hypothesize that
the poorer relative survival in older children with congenital
heart disease may be caused by differences in anatomic
subtype, with older children manifesting a higher proportion
of chronic heart failure as a result of long-term palliated
conditions (eg, the “failing Fontan” operation in the setting of
a single ventricle).
There was a trend toward survival benefit with time, with
an adjusted 5% year-on-year decrease in mortality (odds
ratio, 0.95; P�0.08). This is consistent with improvements in
standardized mortality seen among the entire PICU population over this time period.[16]

**Study Strengths and Limitations**
This study has several strengths. Data from �1850 children
admitted to 33 centers throughout the United Kingdom and
Ireland were included in the analysis. PICANet data were
collected prospectively, and mortality risk was estimated with
PIM2, which has been validated with United Kingdom PICU
data.[17] Analysis with logistic regression with multivariable
fractional polynomials allowed demonstration of the nonlinear relationship between PaO2 and outcome and avoided the
use of arbitrary cutoffs to define hypoxia and hyperoxia
exposure.
There are a number of limitations. The observational study
design can only address associations, and no causal inferences can be made. The association between hyperoxia and
mortality may be confounded by deliberate administration of
high FIO2 in patients with ongoing physiological instability
after resuscitation, who likely have the highest mortality risk,
and the greater likelihood of obtaining blood gases in hyperoxic patients with ongoing physiological instability. The
possibility of such selection bias is supported by the higher
PIM2 risk of death scores in the hyperoxia group than in the
normoxia group and the much lower PIM2 risk of death
scores in the group with no arterial gas. Only clinical trials
can address whether the association between hyperoxia and
mortality is a causal relationship. The study is potentially
prone to selection bias because of the exclusion of one third
of the children who did not have arterial blood gas measurement within the first hour of PICU admission; however, it is
reassuring that the multiple-imputation analysis produced
similar odds ratios for PaO2. The PICANet database is
primarily an audit database of PICU care. As such, the
primary end point was survival to PICU discharge rather than
survival to hospital discharge, as based on the Utstein
criteria.[32] However, mortality after resuscitation from cardiac
arrest peaks rapidly, particularly after out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest,[1] and the majority of deaths will occur within the PICU.
Neurological outcome was not measured in the present study.
We were unable to adjust for additional confounding variables with a known association with mortality (for example,
blood glucose and postarrest pH) that were not collected as
part of the PICANet data set. Although postarrest pH and
PaCO2 were not recorded, the metabolic component of pH
(base excess) was used in the calculation of the PIM2 score.
We acknowledge that mortality risk varies between congen

patients with acyanotic disease have the potential to act as
confounders in the interpretation of association between PaO2
and outcome in this subgroup.
The PICANet database does not allow us to identify
whether therapeutic hypothermia was used. A survey of
United Kingdom pediatric intensivists in 2008 demonstrated
wide variation in the use of therapeutic hypothermia, with
52% of respondents “never” or “rarely” using this therapy.[33]

In those who did use the therapy, there was wide variation in
duration, depth of cooling, and speed of rewarming, with 90%
of units lacking a protocol.[33] In view of the variation in
practice, therapeutic hypothermia is thus unlikely to be a
major confounder. Of note, we included a year effect in the
model that may be influenced by therapeutic hypothermia if
it became more widely used over time.
Finally, the classification into oxygenation groups was
based on the first arterial blood gas, and the duration of
exposure to hypoxia or hyperoxia in the study population is
unknown. Although we sought to investigate the effect of
hyperoxia and hypoxia early after return of circulation, we
acknowledge that only 27% of patients had in-hospital
cardiac arrest within the same hospital as the PICU and that
the first arterial blood gas within 1 hour of PICU or retrieval
team contact in those patients who had out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest or were retrieved was likely to be �1 hour after cardiac
arrest.

#### Conclusions
In this large multicenter study of children admitted to the
PICU after cardiac arrest, we have demonstrated an independent association between both hypoxia, and to a lesser extent,
hyperoxia and the risk of death after adjustment for illness
severity. We have also demonstrated that survival is age
dependent and that this relationship is altered in the setting of
congenital heart disease. Further clinical study is needed to
determine whether avoidance of hyperoxia and hypoxia after
resuscitation will result in better long-term neurological

##### CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Postresuscitation care is an important component that affects outcome after cardiac arrest. Adult studies have suggested a
relationship between exposure to hyperoxia and survival in this setting. We undertook a national retrospective cohort study
that involved 1875 patients from all pediatric intensive care units in the United Kingdom and Ireland to investigate the
relationship between arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO2) after resuscitation from cardiac arrest and mortality. We found
exposure to supranormal oxygen tension was common, with 33% of patients having PaO2 �150 mm Hg on the first blood
gas. We demonstrated a significant association between early postarrest hyperoxia and increased mortality after admission
to the pediatric intensive care unit. A stronger association was also seen between the degree of hypoxia and mortality. Our
data lend support for intervention studies to assess the safety and efficacy of using the lowest inspired oxygen concentration
that maintains arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation of 94% to 96% in the postresuscitation period.
