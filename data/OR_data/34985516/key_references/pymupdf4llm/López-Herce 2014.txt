Abstract

Introduction: Most studies have analyzed pre-arrest and resuscitation factors associated with mortality after cardiac arrest
(CA) in children, but many patients that reach return of spontaneous circulation die within the next days or weeks. The
objective of our study was to analyze post-return of spontaneous circulation factors associated with in-hospital mortality
after cardiac arrest in children.
Methods: A prospective multicenter, multinational, observational study in 48 hospitals from 12 countries was performed.
A total of 502 children aged between 1 month and 18 years with in-hospital cardiac arrest were analyzed. The primary
endpoint was survival to hospital discharge. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to
assess the influence of each post-return of spontaneous circulation factor on mortality.

Results: Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 69.5% of patients; 39.2% survived to hospital discharge and
88.9% of survivors had good neurological outcome. In the univariate analysis, post- return of spontaneous circulation factors related with mortality were pH, base deficit, lactic acid, bicarbonate, FiO2, need for inotropic support, inotropic index,
dose of dopamine and dobutamine at 1 hour and at 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation as well as Pediatric
Intensive Care Unit and total hospital length of stay. In the multivariate analysis factors associated with mortality at 1 hour
after return of spontaneous circulation were PaCO2 < 30 mmHg and >50 mmHg, inotropic index >14 and lactic acid
>5 mmol/L. Factors associated with mortality at 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation were PaCO2 > 50 mmHg,
inotropic index >14 and FiO2 ≥ 0.80.
Conclusions: Secondary in-hospital mortality among the initial survivors of CA is high. Hypoventilation,
hyperventilation, FiO2 ≥ 0.80, the need for high doses of inotropic support, and high levels of lactic acid were
the most important post-return of spontaneous circulation factors associated with in-hospital mortality in
children in our population.

Introduction
Most studies have analyzed pre-arrest and resuscitation factors associated with mortality after cardiac arrest (CA) in
children [1-13]. Previous studies have shown that lower human development index of countries, characteristics of the
hospital, CA that occurred out of hospital and out of the
Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), oncohematologic disease, treatment with inotropic drugs at the time of the CA,
CA due to neurological disease or sepsis, time to the initiation of resuscitation, asystole as the initial electrocardiographic (ECG) rhythm, need for adrenaline, bicarbonate or
fluid expansion and the duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are associated with higher mortality [1-13].
An important percentage of patients that reach return
of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) die within the next
days or weeks. However, there are no multicenter, multinational prospective studies on CA in children to have
analyzed post-ROSC prognostic factors. In previous
studies performed on the same prospective register we
have analyzed the pre-arrest and resuscitation factors

[11] and the ventilation and oxygenation factors associated with mortality [14]. The objective of the present
study was to analyze the factors affecting mortality and
neurological outcome of in-hospital CA in children. The
hypothesis was that respiratory status and hemodynamic
status are the most important prognosis factors after
ROSC in children.

Methods
An open multicenter prospective study was designed
and information and an invitation to participate were
sent to the pediatric departments and PICUs of hospitals
in Latin-American countries, Spain, Portugal, and Italy.
The study was approved by local Institutional Review
Boards (Additional file 1). Registration on the website

[15] was necessary to participate in the study. Consent
of parents of patients was not considered necessary because it was an observational study during and after CA
and it is necessary to obtain data immediately.
A protocol was drawn up in accordance with the
Utstein style [16,17]. Children aged from 1 month
to 18 years who suffered in-hospital CA between
December 2007 and December 2009 were included. CA
was defined by the presence of all the following signs:
unresponsiveness, apnea, absence of signs of life and absence of a palpable central pulse or bradycardia with
less than 60 beats per minute (bpm) with poor perfusion
in infants requiring external cardiac compressions and
assisted ventilation.
All data were entered via a secure, encrypted website
and were electronically submitted to the coordinating
center. That center performed a review of all records to
ensure data quality, and site investigators were queried
to complete missing data and resolve discrepancies.


Patient-related variables and arrest and life supportrelated parameters have been previously published [11] and
also the relationship between ventilation and oxygenation
with mortality [14]. In the present study we analyzed the influence on survival of several post-ROSC parameters, such
as arterial gasometry and lactic acid at the first hour and
24 hours after ROSC, the need for mechanical ventilation,
recovery of spontaneous breathing (although mechanical
ventilation could be needed), the need for vasoactive drugs
and doses of vasoactive drugs, vasoactive-inotropic index
(VIS) [18], and ECG rhythm after ROSC. Hospital course
and clinical and neurological status at hospital discharge
according to the pediatric cerebral performance category

[PCPC] were registered [19]. Variable definitions were
based on Utstein-style guidelines [16,17]. The primary endpoint was survival to hospital discharge. The secondary outcome measure was neurological status at hospital
discharge; a good neurological status was defined as a
PCPC score of 1 or 2 [19].
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software
version 18.1 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Outcomes were
compared between groups using the chi-square (χ[2]) test or
Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Univariate and
multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to
assess the influence of each one of the factors on mortality.
A logistic regression model was constructed for variables at
1 hour and at 24 hours after ROSC. All individual factors
with statistical significance in the univariate analysis and
P <0.1 were eligible for inclusion in the logistic regression
model. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were
used to decided cutoffs values for VIS and lactic acid. Ventilation and oxygenation cutoff values were chosen according to previous studies [20,21] and normal limits of pH,
ventilation and oxygenation. Finally a logistic regression
model was constructed including patient-related variables,
arrest- and life support-related parameters, and post-ROSC
parameters. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) were calculated for each model. ROC curves
were used to assess the predictive capacity of each model.

Results
Forty-eight hospitals from twelve countries participated
in the study. The analysis included 563 episodes of inhospital CA in 502 patients. CA occurred in the PICU
in 50% of cases, in the emergency department in 26.8%,
and in other hospital areas in 23.2%.
Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for more
than 20 minutes was achieved in 349 patients (69.5%),
but 152 (30.3%) patients died later in hospital due to
new CA (32.9%), multiple organ dysfunction (27%),
limitation of medical therapy (25%) or brain death
(15.1%): 197 patients (39.2%) survived to hospital discharge. Five patients were rescued with extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during CPR and four

of them survived to hospital discharge. The characteristics of the 502 patients, pre-arrest factors, and cardiac
arrest and resuscitation factors associated with mortality
have been previously published [11].

Post-ROSC factors associated with mortality
Table 1 shows the comparison between survivors and
non-survivors in post-ROSC factors. Non-survivors had
lower pH, higher base excess, higher lactic acid levels and
higher inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) at 1 and 24 hours
after ROSC than survivors. A greater percentage of nonsurvivors needed inotropic support, and they required
higher doses of dopamine and dobutamine, and had a
higher inotropic score than survivors did. Nevertheless,
the percentage of patients receiving milrinone was lower
in non-survivors than in survivors. When patients without
inotropic support before CA were analyzed separately,
children who required inotropic support after ROSC had

Table 1 Comparison between survivors and non-survivors


42.1% higher mortality than those who did not need it
26.9% (P =0.036). Finally, the length of PICU stay and total
hospital stay was shorter in non-survivors.
Table 2 summarizes post-ROSC factors and their relationship with survival to hospital discharge in the univariate regression analysis. The need for inotropic support, an
inotropic index greater than 14, the absence of spontaneous breathing, PaCO2 < 30 mmHg or >50 mmHg, FiO2 ≥
0.80 and lactic acid levels >5 mmol/L at 1 hour after
ROSC, as well as pH <7.30, PaCO2 > 50 mmHg and
FiO2 > 50% at 24 hours after ROSC were significantly
associated with higher mortality rates. There were no
significant differences in post-ROSC PaO2 between survivors and non-survivors patients, even when the 24
patients with cyanotic heart disease and 6 patients on
ECMO were excluded of analysis.
In the multivariate analysis, factors associated with
mortality at 1 hour after ROSC were PaCO2 < 30 mmHg

Post-ROSC factors associated with neurological outcome
Neurological status at hospital discharge was assessed in
120 patients (60.9%), and 107 of them (89%) had a normal neurological status or showed mild disability (PCPC
l or 2). PCPC before CA and at hospital discharge was
compared. Only 2.8% of patients with PCPC 1 or 2 before CA presented a PCPC >2 at hospital discharge.
When comparing patients with good and bad neurological outcome (PCPC >2), at 1 hour after ROSC those
with a bad outcome had significantly lower levels of bicarbonate (19.1 (7.4) mEq/L versus 21.8 (6.9) mEq/L;
P =0.025), higher lactic acid levels (8.1 (6.5) mmol/L versus
5.8 (11.3) mmol/L; P =0.003) and higher base excess (BE)
(-7.1 (9.4) mEq/L versus -3.4 (9.6) mEq/L; P =0.042)
(Table 4). A higher percentage of patients with bad neurological outcome received dobutamine (40.9%) than those
with good neurological outcome (19%) P =0.007 (Table 4).


The univariate analysis showed that dobutamine administration and lactic acid levels >5 mmol/L at 1 hour, and
pH >7.50, PaCO2 > 50 mmHg and BE >4 mEq/L at
24 hours after ROSC were associated with poor neurological evolution (Table 5).
In the multivariate analysis the only factor associated with
poor neurological outcome at 1 hour after ROSC was lactic
acid above 5 mmol/L (OR 9.902, CI (1.992 to 51.008);
P =0.006). None of the factors at 24 hours after ROSC
showed statistical significance in the multivariate analysis.

Pre-arrest, resuscitation and post-ROSC factors

arrest in children according to the Utstein style guidelines. Sustained ROSC was achieved in 69.5% patients
but secondary in-hospital mortality among the initial
survivors of CA was 43.5% and survival to hospital discharge was therefore 39.2%.

Oxygenation and ventilation parameters
Several studies, including our previous analysis, showed
that alterations in ventilation and oxygenation during the
first hours after ROSC are associated with prognosis

[14,20-24]. Our study shows that PaCO2 < 30 mmHg and
>50 mmHg at 1 hour and PaCO2 > 50 mmHg at 24 hours
after ROSC are mortality indicators [14]. Our results differ
from those reported in a retrospective study in 195 children after CA, in which no relationship was found between ventilation and mortality [20]. Hyperventilation
may increase mortality and brain damage by reducing
cerebral blood flow and tissue perfusion resulting in ischemia [22]. On the other hand, hypoventilation may increase
the risk of cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension
due to cerebral vasodilation [23]. In addition, hypercapnia
can impair myocardial function and induce vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vascular bed [23]. Our findings
highlight the importance of monitoring ventilation using
capnography and blood gas analysis in order to rapidly
achieve an appropriate ventilation status after ROSC,


although capnography values can be altered in patients
with abnormal PaO2/FiO2.
PaO2 was not associated with mortality in the univariate
or in the multivariate analysis at 1 hour and at 24 hours
after ROSC. Two recent retrospective studies in children
did not find this association between mortality and oxygenation either [20,24]. Nevertheless, another retrospective
study that analyzed 1,875 pediatric patients found a correlation between mortality in the PICU and hypoxia and, to a
lesser extent, with hyperoxia. This study did not analyze the
relationship between ventilation and mortality [21].
In our study, non-survivors had higher FiO2 than survivors, and the univariate analysis showed that FiO2 ≥ 0.80
was associated with mortality. The multivariate logistic regression study showed that high FiO2 could be considered
a risk factor only at 24 hours after ROSC. Elevated FiO2
may cause cellular toxicity as shown in previous studies in
neonates [25]. On the other hand, elevated FiO2 could also
indicate a greater need for oxygen, as worse tissue oxygenation may exist. Nevertheless, no relationship was found
between PaO2 or PaO2/FiO2 and mortality in the patients
in our study, and it may be that these patients did not
require such a high FiO2. On the other hand we did not
find association between ventilation and oxygenation parameters and neurologic outcome. This may be because
the number of patients with hypoxia and hyperoxia was

insufficient to detect significant differences, or that only
important alterations in oxygenation could influence
neurologic outcome.
We think that it is possible that ventilation and oxygenation could influence the prognosis of children who suffer
CA. However, multicenter controlled studies with a sufficient number of patients are needed because many other
factors besides ventilation and oxygenation may influence
outcome in CA patients.

Lactid acid
Lactic acid is one of the most commonly used parameters to assess and monitor hypoperfusion or tissue hypoxia in critically ill patients, as it has been demonstrated
to have good prognostic capacity and it is easy and fast
to measure [26]. Lactate levels in patients who have recovered from CA probably reflect the severity of the
ischemia-reperfusion syndrome. Nevertheless, high lactic
acid levels may exist without the presence of tissue hypoperfusion due to the administration of adrenaline or
to the presence of hyperglycemia, which are very common after CA [26].
Several studies have found that lactate levels in the
first 48 hours after CA is lower in survivors and in patients without neurological damage [27-29]. The levels
of lactate after ROSC and 12 or 24 h later were significantly higher in non survivors adults and children after
out-of-hospital and in-hospital CA [9,30-33]. Lactate
clearance within the first 24 hours (lactate after ROSC
minus lactate 24 hours after ROSC) × 100/lactate after
ROSC) is significantly higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors [30-32].
In our study, non-survivors had more acidosis both at
1 hour and at 24 hours after ROSC. Acidosis was mainly
due to metabolic acidosis, with lower bicarbonate levels
and higher base deficit in non-survivors than in survivors. Nevertheless, the only factor associated with mortality in the logistic regression analysis was lactic acid at
1 hour and at 24 hours after ROSC. Non-survivors presented significantly higher levels of lactic acid at 1 and
24 hours after ROSC, and lactic acid levels >5 mmol/L
were associated with higher mortality in the univariate
and multivariate analysis.
Although lactate at 1 and at 24 hours after ROSC was
higher in non-survivors, no significant differences were
found in lactate clearance, because lactate acid levels significantly decreased in the first 24 hours in both groups
(from 16.9 to 5.8 mmol/L in non-survivors and from 6.7
to 3.7 mmol/L in survivors).

Vasoactive treatment
Hemodynamic alterations after ROSC are also late
mortality risk factors. Cardiac rhythm after ROSC and
need for vasoactive drugs in the first 24 hours were


analyzed in order to assess hemodynamic alterations.
Other hemodynamic parameters, such as heart rate, blood
pressure or central venous pressure were not registered.
The non-surviving group had a greater percentage of
patients requiring vasoactive support and at higher
doses (higher inotropic index) than the surviving group.
The univariate and multivariate studies showed that
vasoactive-inotropic score >14 was significantly associated with mortality.
Several studies have found that the need for pressors
previous to CA is a mortality risk factor, both in adults

[34-37] and in children [4,6,8,11]. Our study shows that
the need for pressors and at higher doses (vasoactiveinotropic score) after CA is associated with higher risk
of mortality. This fact has also been found by Meert
et al. [9]. This highlights the influence of early
hemodynamic alterations on outcome in children after
CA, and the importance of treating these alterations
as they appear.
On the other hand, a large percentage of patients received more than one vasoactive agent after ROSC. That
may be the cause for not finding a significant association
between mortality and the administration or dosage of
any specific vasoactive drug, but with the intensity of
vasoactive treatment in general. Inotropic score has
proved to be appropriate in assessing vasoactive support
and its relationship with mortality in several studies in
children in shock, after open heart surgery and after
heart transplantation [18,38,39]. Rhodes et al. found that
the inotropic score was higher in non-survivors than in
survivors with CA after congenital heart surgery [39].
Our study also suggests that the vasoactive-inotropic
score may be a useful prognostic indicator in children
after CA.
A recent retrospective study in adults showed that the
combination of elevated lactate levels and the need for
vasoactive support had a good mortality predictive capacity in patients that recovered from CA [40]. Our
results agree with those from the mentioned study,
although in our study the dose of vasoactive support
also proved to have mortality predictive capacity. Furthermore, PaCO2 levels, which were not registered in
the study in adults, also proved to have prognostic
capacity in our study. On the other hand, lactic acid
levels >5 mmol/L at 1 hour after ROSC was the only
factor that was associated with bad neurological outcome in our study.

Pre-arrest, resuscitation and post-ROSC multivariate
analysis
Meert et al. [9] performed a multivariate analysis including
pre-arrest, resuscitation and 12 h post-ROSC factors. In this
study the only post-ROSC factor associated with survival al
hospital discharge was the responsive pupils after ROSC.

http://ccforum.com/content/18/6/607

Conversely, our multivariate analysis, including prearrest, resuscitation and post-ROSC factors, showed
that the post-ROSC factors associated with mortality
were hypoventilation and hyperventilation 1 hour after
ROSC and high FiO2 24 hours after ROSC, highlighting
the importance of the control of ventilation and oxygenation after ROSC.

Limitations
Our study has several limitations. One of them is that
hemodynamic variables such as heart rate, blood pressure
and central venous pressure in the first 24 hours after ROSC
were not registered, making it impossible to accurately assess the presence of shock in these patients. In a recent
study hypotension after ROSC was related to bad prognosis

[41]. Hypothermia or hyperthermia and the parameters of
mechanical ventilation were not registered neither.
Pre-arrest values of lactate or vasoactive-inotropic score
could influence post-ROSC values but we did not register
pre-arrest lactate and VIS data in our patients. On the
other hand, our study has only analyzed prognostic factors
in the first 24 hours after ROSC, which may be the most
important but not the only ones. Other factors that affect
prognosis but may appear in the following days, such as
nosocomial infections or multiple organ failure, were not
analyzed. Actually, the median PICU stay for nonsurvivors was 8 days, and many of these patients died because of complications due to multi-organ failure.
Finally, only 61% of patients have neurologic outcome
evaluation, although there were no differences in baseline characteristics between patients with and without a
neurologic outcome measure. On the other hand, only a
small number of patients had bad neurological outcomes. This is why the power of the statistical analysis
in relationship with neurological outcome is poor, so results must be interpreted with caution. Therefore, more
studies are needed to prospectively assess both early and
late post-ROSC mortality and neurologic outcome risk
factors in children after CA.

Conclusions
We conclude that secondary in-hospital mortality among
the initial survivors of CA is high (43.5% in our study).
The most important early mortality risk factors after
ROSC in in-hospital CA in children are hyperventilation,
hypoventilation, high FiO2 requirements need for high
doses of inotropic drugs and high lactic acid levels. High
lactic acid levels at 1 hour after ROSC were associated
with bad neurological outcome.

Key messages

ROSC in-hospital CA in children were hyperventilation, hypoventilation, need for high doses of inotropic drugs, high lactic acid levels and high FiO2
requirements
� High lactic acid levels at 1 hour after ROSC were
associated with bad neurological outcome
� Early treatment of hemodynamic and respiratory
disturbances after ROSC could improve mortality in
initial survivors of CA
