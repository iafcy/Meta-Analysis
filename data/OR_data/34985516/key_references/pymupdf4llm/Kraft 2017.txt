Background: Mechanical ventilation with oxygen is life-saving,
however, may result in hyperoxia. The aim was to analyse the
incidence and duration of hyperoxia burden and related in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients.
Methods: Patients of all ages admitted to intensive care units
(ICUs) and with mechanical ventilation for at least seven consecutive days were included in this single centre retrospective medical
record audit. The main outcome measure was time-weighted arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) over 7 days. Logistic regression for association with in-hospital mortality and propensity
score matching was performed.
Results: In total, 20,889 arterial blood gases of 419 patients were
analysed. Time-weighted mean PaO2 was 14.0 � 2.4 kPa. Timeweighted mean FiO2 was 49.2 � 12.1%. Seventy-six (18.1%)
patients showed continuous hyperoxia exposure, defined as timeweighted mean PaO2 > 16 kPa. Duration of hyperoxia, hypoxia
(PaO2 < 8 kPa) and normoxia (PaO2 8–16 kPa) were
37.9 31.0 h (23.7%), 4.9 9.5 h (3.1%), and 116.8 29.6 h
� � �
(73.2%). Hyperoxia occurred especially at low to moderate FiO2
in patients of first and second age quartiles (1–57 years) with
smaller SAPS2 score. In-hospital mortality of patients with hyperoxia (32.9%) or normoxia did not differ (35.9%; P = 0.691). Conditional logistic regression showed no association between
hyperoxia and in-hospital mortality (OR 1.46; 95%CI 0.72–2.96;
P = 0.29).
Conclusion: Substantial hyperoxia burden was observed in ICU
patients. Young patients with less comorbidities showed hyperoxic episodes more often, especially with lower FiO2. Hyperoxia
during 7 days of mechanical ventilation did not correlate to
increased in-hospital mortality.

In the intensive care unit (ICU), supplemental
oxygen (O2) during invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is routinely administered in patients
with acute respiratory failure to prevent from
organ hypoxia. Beyond doubt, severe hypoxia
can contribute to increased ICU morbidity and
mortality. Therefore, it has been suggested for
years that critically ill patients would benefit
from a more liberal O2 therapy, taking into
account that episodes of accidental hyperoxia
may also harm the lungs and remote organs.
Recently, it has been proposed that accidental
hyperoxia may play a key role in determining
patient clinical outcome. Reactive O2 species,
mainly derived from mitochondrial oxidative
metabolism with its cytochrome oxidase system,
cause inflammatory as well as cytotoxic processes during hyperoxic episodes.[1][–][3] A retrospective study by De Jonge et al. from 2008
demonstrated a U-shaped association between
arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and
in-hospital mortality,[4] suggesting that both severe hypoxia and hyperoxia on the first day of
ICU admission, may worsen clinical outcome.
However, Eastwood et al. could not confirm
these findings in a large retrospective data analysis published in 2012.[5] Several smaller retrospective studies in specific ICU subsets,
including patients admitted for stroke, traumatic
brain injury, and cardiac arrest also found a correlation between hyperoxia and increased inhospital mortality. Two recent meta-analyses by
Damiani et al. in 2014 and Helmerhorst et al. in
2015 conclude that hyperoxia may be associated
with poor in-hospital outcome, however, suggest that more clinical evidence is required to
better tailor for optimal individual O2 targets.[6,7]

Oxygen must be regarded as any other drug
with potential dose- and time-depended side
effects. It is not clearly understood, whether
longer exposure (e.g., several days after ICU
admission) with significantly elevated oxygen
levels result in higher morbidity and mortality.
Clinical evidence on the impact of prolonged
hyperoxia in ICU patients is lacking, as actual
studies only focus on short observation periods
(e.g., the first day of ICU admission).
Therefore, the aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse the incidence and duration of
hyperoxia burden in ICU patients. A mixed surgical and anaesthesiological cohort of ICU


patients undergoing IMV for at least 7 days was
investigated to estimate hyperoxic burden during long-term IMV. Hyperoxic burden was correlated with in-hospital mortality to determine
if prolonged hyperoxia exposure may be associated with poor clinical outcome in ICU patients.

Methods

Study design and patient inclusion

This single centre retrospective medical record
audit was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Medical University of Vienna,
Austria (No. 1428/2014, approved by Prof. Ernst
Singer on 15.07.2014). The study data consist of
retrospective data subsets collected from seven
surgical and anaesthesiological ICUs of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria, collected from
January 1st 2009 until April 22nd 2013 with
12909 (3040 250 annually) admitted patients of
�
which 6735 (1579 89 annually) received IMV.
�
All patients submitted to one of the ICUs, either
planned or unplanned as well as medical or surgical, undergoing positive pressure IMV for at least
seven consecutive days after ICU admission were
included in the study. The primary outcome variable was time-weighted PaO2 during 7 days of
IMV. Due to the retrospective character of the
study, no informed consent of patients or relatives
was obtained and the study was not registered in
a clinical trials database. Patient data sets with
missing values were excluded from the analysis.
As all suitable data sets were included, no sample
size calculation was performed.

Measurements

The following variables were extracted from the
sampling data set for each patient: continuously
digitally recorded peripheral hemoglobin O2
saturation (SaO2, %) measured by pulse oximetry, and fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2, %)
assessed from respirator settings; PaO2 (kPa)
and hemoglobin (g/dl) measured by repetitive
daily arterial blood gas analyses (ABG) as prescribed by the attending physician. Also, number of ABG samples during the observation
period of seven consecutive days after ICU
admission, and duration between each recorded

ABG value in the study period were collected
from the patient medical records. The issue of
consecutive or missing data values was handled
as follows. It was assumed that recorded ABG
values remained stable over time until a new
physiological value was recorded.

Demographics and outcome parameters

Demographic data, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score 2 (SAPS2) on ICU admission,
Hospital length of stay (HLOS), ICU length of
stay (ICU-LOS), ICU mortality and in-hospital
mortality were obtained from the patient medical records.

Calculated values and grouping

Time-weighted mean values of PaO2 (PaO2.wmean, kPa) and FiO2 (FiO2.wmean, %) were calculated by multiplying the measured individual
value with the duration until the next value was
obtained divided by the complete time of observation and then taking the sum of all values per
patient. The duration of hyperoxic
(PaO2 > 16 kPa, h), normoxic (PaO2 8–16 kPa, h)
and hypoxic (PaO2 < 8 kPa, h) episodes were
identified. In addition, duration of FiO2 > 50%
was calculated and defined as high FiO2. Also, the
maximal PaO2 value (PaO2.max, kPa) that
occurred during the 7 days of observation was
determined for each patient. Patients experiencing
continuous hyperoxia (PaO2.wmean > 16 kPa,
PaO2.H) and patients experiencing normoxia
(PaO2.wmean of 8–16 kPa, PaO2.N) during all
7 days of observation were identified to test for
statistical differences between groups.
All physiological and demographic patient data
was gathered from the routine ICU documentation software (CareVue Version 12, Phillips Medical Systems, Andover, MA, USA 2001).
Microsoft[�] Access Version 2013 (Microsoft[�] Inc.,
Redmond, Washington) was used to create an
anonymized patient database of all collected
physiological and demographic patient data.

Statistical analysis

For continuous variables mean and SD and for
categorical variables absolute and relative frequencies were calculated. Student’s t-test was

Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica (2017)


used for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact
test was used for categorical variables to analyse
differences in distributions of covariates.
A propensity score matching was applied to
create a balanced subsample of patients. The
treatment variable was hyperoxia (i.e.,
PaO2.wmean > 16 kPa). For each patient, the
probability of being assigned to the hyperoxia
group (=propensity score) was calculated from a
logistic regression model, where hyperoxia was
modeled as a function of the following covariates: age, sex, HLOS, FiO2.wmean, PaO2.max,
SAPS2, duration of PaO2 < 8 kPa, duration of
FiO2 > 50% and admission diagnose. Matching
was done in a 1 : 1 ratio using the nearest
neighbor method as implemented in the
R-package “MatchIt”.[8]

Using the matched dataset, a conditional
logistic regression for matched pairs was calculated to analyse the effect of hyperoxia
(PaO2.H), PaO2.wmean and PaO2.max on
in-hospital mortality. In addition, a logistic
regression model using all patients with in-hospital mortality as dependent variable and
PaO2.H and the propensity score as independent
covariates was created. Time-weighted mean
PaO2 values were adapted as predictor variable
for the logistic regression by only using the
results of day two to seven for calculation,
because PaO2 is also included in the SAPS2.
Thereby an overrepresentation of PaO2 in the
model was avoided. The significance level for
all tests was 5%. Calculations were performed
[using the software program R 3.2.0 (www.r-pro](http://www.r-project.com)
[ject.com, Vienna, Austria).](http://www.r-project.com)

Results

Descriptive statistics

The analysis was based on 419 of 554 patients
(75.6%) with complete data sets over seven consecutive days. Twenty-nine patients (5.2%)
were excluded from the analysis due to missing
values for the calculation of SAPS2 score and
106 patients (19.1%) were lacking daily ABG
results during the observation period (Fig. 1).
The collective consisted of 161 female (38.4%)
and 258 male (61.6%) patients with a SAPS2 of
46 18.6. Mean age was 57.8 19.9 years and
� �
ranged from 1 to 91 years. Nineteen patients

(4.5%) were adolescent during observation with
five patients being younger than 6 years (1.2%).
The PaO2.wmean and in-hospital mortality of
the excluded patients did not differ significantly
from the final study sample. The median ICU
stay was 22 days (range 7–189) with an ICU
mortality of 30.1% (n = 126). Overall in-hospital
mortality in the study sample was 35.3%
(n = 148). Additional descriptive patient data is
displayed in Table 1.

Hyperoxia, hypoxia and normoxia

In total, 20889 ABG values (in average
49.9 12 ABGs per patient) were analysed.
�
Unweighted mean PaO2 was 14.5 � 6.7 kPa and
PaO2.wmean was 14.0 � 2.4 kPa in all patients
over the whole time of observation. Intraday
variability in PaO2.wmean was highest on the
first day of IMV on ICU (Fig. 2). PaO2.max was
34.4 15.3 kPa. A total number of 76 patients
�
(18.1%) showed hyperoxic PaO2.wmean values
(PaO2.H) and 343 patients (81.9%) showed
PaO2.wmean values between 8–16 kPa, defined


as normoxic (PaO2.N). A PaO2.wmean < 8 kPa
was not observed in any patient. Calculated
duration of hyperoxia, normoxia and hypoxia in
the study period was 37.9 31.0 h (23.7%),
�
116.8 29.6 h (73.2%), and 4.9 9.5 h (3.1%),
� �
respectively, as shown in Fig. 3. Patients
received an unweighted mean FiO2 of
52.8 � 15% and FiO2.wmean of 49.2 � 12.4%
during the study period.
Group differences between PaO2.H and
PaO2.N are displayed in Table 2. There was no
difference between PaO2.H and PaO2.N in terms
of in-hospital mortality (P = 0.691), ICU-mortality (P = 0.491) or SAPS2 (P = 0.073). Significant
differences between PaO2.H and PaO2.N were
observed for HLOS (P = 0.0003), ICU-LOS
(P = 0.039), PaO2.max (P < 0.0001), and age
with the patients of the PaO2.H group being
much younger (43.3 21.6 years vs. 57.3
� �
18.6 years; P < 0.0001, Fig. 4). Also, the PaO2.H
group was less hypoxic (1.7 3.1 h vs.
�
5.6 10.2 h; P < 0.0001), even though, overall
�
receiving lower levels of FiO2 (FiO2.wmean
42.8 9.9% vs. 50.7 12.1%; P < 0.0001, and
� �
high FiO2 30.9 h vs. 63.2 h; P < 0.0001).

Group differences based on mortality

Patients, who deceased during hospital stay
were significantly older (P < 0.0001), had higher
SAPS2 (P < 0.0001), shorter HLOS (P < 0.0001),
a higher FiO2.wmean (52.5 � 14.2% vs.
47.5 10.4%; P = 0.0002) and longer duration
�
of high FiO2 (P = 0.0005). The duration of
hypoxia was doubled in these patients
(6.8 11.8 h vs. 3.8 7.6 h; P = 0.005). No dif� �
ference in PaO2.wmean, PaO2.max, or duration
of hyperoxia was observed compared to patients
discharged alive (Table S1).

Propensity score matching

Due to the inhomogeneity in the study sample,
to every patient of the PaO2.H group one patient
of the PaO2.N group with similar propensity
score was matched to compensate baseline differences. The final matched collective consisted
of 76 pairs of patients while 267 normoxic
patients were not used for further analyses. The
median ICU stay of the matched pairs was
19 days (range 7–118) with an ICU mortality of

24.3% (n = 37). Overall in-hospital mortality in
the matched study sample was 28.9% (n = 44).
After propensity score matching, the two groups
did not differ statistically significant in
demographic and respiratory data except for
PaO2wmean (14.2 � 1.1 kPa vs. 17.7 � 1.7 kPa;
P < 0.0001). Patients in the PaO2.H group had
higher in-hospital mortality (32.9% vs. 25.0%;
P = 0.28) and ICU mortality (26.3% vs. 22.4%;
P = 0.57) as compared to matched patients of
the PaO2.N group, without being statistically
significant.

Logistic regression

Univariate unadjusted logistic regression
showed that PaO2.wmean (OR 0.992; 95%CI
0.981–1.004; P = 0.173) and prolonged hyperoxia (PaO2.H) (OR 0.877; 95%CI 0.518-1.485;
P = 0.625) were not related to in-hospital mortality in the complete sample of 419 patients. In

Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica (2017)


the logistic regression using the full data while
adjusting for the propensity score the odds ratio
of hyperoxia for in-hospital mortality was 1.25
(95%CI 0.64–2.42; P = 0.51) without being statistically significant. The conditional logistic
regression for the matched data showed that the
effect of hyperoxia as nominal variable (PaO2.H
and PaO2.N) on in-hospital mortality was not
statistically significant (OR 1.46; 95%CI 0.72–
2.96; P = 0.29). PaO2.wmean (OR 1.017, 95%CI
0.9954–1.039; P = 0.124) and PaO2.max (OR
1.003, 95%CI 0.9982–1.008; P = 0.226) were
also no predictors for in-hospital mortality in
the conditional logistic regression.

hyperoxia and related in-hospital mortality in
critically ill patients. Our study was the first
investigating daily hyperoxia burden over seven
consecutive days in patients undergoing IMV.


PaO2.wmean values showed the highest variability and mean on the first day of IMV on
ICU. Continuous hyperoxia occurred in 23.7%
of observation period. Our results demonstrated
that hyperoxic episodes predominantly occurred
in younger patients receiving FiO2 levels
≤ 50%. The occurrence of hyperoxia showed no
effect on in-hospital and ICU mortality, duration
of ICU stay or overall hospitalization as compared to normoxia exposure.

Incidence of hyperoxia

In contrast to former studies, we did not investigate only one single PaO2 value but calculated
mean PaO2 over time. Also, the studied ICU
patients underwent IMV for at least seven consecutive days while most published research is
based on first 24–48 h after ICU admission. As
recently suggested by Helmerhorst et al., clinical
studies investigating this topic should not only
take into account solitary PaO2 values on ICU
admission but also instead investigate for timeaveraged mean of PaO2 and other values to
determine hyperoxic burden of ICU patients.[9]

With the given study design, we could identify patients being exposed to hyperoxia beyond
doubt. ABG results showed that intraday variability and mean PaO2 values were highest on
the first day of observation period with 184
patients (43.9%) presenting hyperoxia. This
finding is similar to another study reporting
49.8% of hyperoxic patients on first day of ICU
admission.[5] Only including data from the first
day of admission could have been misleading
on the actual exposure to hyperoxia of patients.
We could show that continuous hyperoxia, in
terms of time-weighted mean of PaO2 > 16 kPa,
occurred in 23.7% during the entire observation
period. These findings demonstrate that hyperoxia frequently occurs in ICU patients, despite
standard operating procedures on ICU aiming for
reduction in excessive O2 levels. ICU patients are
exposed to a significant hyperoxic burden over
time. A recent meta-analysis published in 2014
by Damiani et al. concluded that one of the main
issues in comparing literature regarding this
relevant topic is the heterogeneity of ICU patients
in mixed collectives, different definitions of
hyperoxia (e.g., PaO2 > 16 kPa, PaO2 > 40 kPa),
as well as selection of the values used for

investigation (e.g., worst PaO2, highest PaO2,
mean PaO2, time-weighted SpO2).[6] We chose
PaO2 > 16 kPa as the threshold for hyperoxia in
this study as it is more likely to find patients
being exposed to hyperoxia for 7 days.

Furthermore, two multicentre retrospective
cohort studies also examining mixed ICU
patients receiving IMV used that definition for
hyperoxia, which enables us to more reliably
compare our results to former studies.

Hyperoxia and in-hospital mortality

This study results did not find a correlation
between hyperoxia and increased in-hospital
mortality. Normoxic patients showed lower
in-hospital and ICU mortality compared to
hyperoxic patients, without being statistically
significant. As the absolute risk reduction was
close to eight percent for normoxia, this is a
promising trend for following investigations
with a higher number of studied patients. Also,
Girardis et al. reported an absolute risk reduction
of 8.6% in their conservative group targeting for
lower PaO2 and SpO2 in ICU patients.10 Unfortunately, they had to stop enrolling patients early
and thereby missed the calculated sample size for
the primary outcome ICU mortality.
Interestingly, we observed that patients with
hyperoxia had shorter HLOS and ICU-LOS,
potentially attributed to the fact that patients of
young age predominantly experienced episodes
of hyperoxia. After propensity score matching,
no differences were observed anymore. Furthermore, other than expected, episodes of hyperoxia predominantly occurred at low rather than
high FiO2 settings. Our data therefore suggest
that typical ICU patients at risk for hyperoxia
burden might be young and less severe critically
ill ICU patients receiving a lower FiO2. We
believe that this finding is of clinical interest
and needs to be taken into account when tailoring for individual optimal O2 values during
IMV. In our opinion, further research investigating the beneficial or harmful effects of hyperoxia
in ICU patients, especially with prolonged exposure, seems justified. Although some clinical
data suggests that hyperoxia may relate to
increased morbidity and mortality, the debate
on the elusive promise of hyperoxia continues
and further clarification is needed.

Future concepts of more tailored O2 therapy

Recent clinical evidence suggests that ICU staff
is aware of the potentially harmful effects of
prolonged hyperoxia.[11,12] Nevertheless, O2 therapy still is not often adjusted to the individual
ICU patient needs for various reasons. This
includes technological difficulties of tailoring for
individual O2 values but also missing consensus
guidelines on optimal O2 targets.[13][–][15] Despite,


novel approaches for the implementation of
more conservative rather than liberal O2 targets
in ICU settings were published and appear feasible and easy to implement.[16][–][19] One step further, Martin and Grocott et al. brought up the
idea of permissive hypoxemia, meaning deliberately tailoring arterial oxygenation below normally tolerated levels to avoid hyperoxia. Still,
this novel concept needs clinical testing and
lacks of solid evidence to improve ICU patient
outcome.[20,21]

Study limitations and strengths

One limitation of our single centre study is that
the patient cohort investigated is rather small
and therefore potentially underpowered. However, we did only include ICU patients with
IMV for at least 7 days. Similar to former studies, we investigated a mixed anaesthesiological
and surgical cohort that might bias our results.
Also, we unfortunately did not investigate for
the effects of hyperoxia on organ dysfunction as
assessed by laboratory or clinical signs of organ
injury. In the opinion of the authors it is of
great clinical interest if ICU patients with
reduced oxidative reserve (e.g. sepsis, diabetes,
old age) might be more susceptible to oxidative
injury than younger and healthier ICU patients.
The potentially harmful rather than beneficial
effects of hyperoxia are investigated in numerous running trials with different approaches
(NCT02321072, NCT02713451, NCT02378545)
showing the broad interest on this topic especially in ICU patients with severe sepsis and
acute respiratory failure. Another strong limitation of this study is the assumption that PaO2
and FiO2 remained stable over time when calculating for time-weighted mean PaO2 and FiO2
values. However, performing more frequent
repetitive daily ABG would be extremely time
and personnel consuming and seems unrealistic
to perform. Although this issue certainly represents a study limitation, we believe that our
approach seems valuable to approximate hyperoxic burden and propose in accordance to
Helmerhorst et al. that it should be used in further clinical studies.[9] Finally, we acknowledge
that our study has been retrospective in nature
and results must be interpreted with caution.
An initial inhomogeneity of the study sample

was well treated by propensity score matching.
After that, a representative, matched control
group without hyperoxic burden was available
and compensated in part for the retrospective
character of the study. Demographic properties
and existing comorbidities were taken into
account and did not differ in the finally analysed patient data.
The quest on optimal O2 targets in perioperative and ICU settings is not over. Oxygen is
regarded a drug with dose- and time-dependent
side effects. This topic is of special interest for all
anaesthesiologists and intensivists and should be
followed up in future trials with a prospective
study design to distinctly examine the influence
of elevated oxygen levels on ventilated ICU
patients. The importance of oxygen titration is
also reflected in the recent WHO recommendation
for perioperative high FiO2 during abdominal
surgery to reduce surgical site infections,[22] which
is very controversially discussed.

Conclusion

The present retrospective study investigated
hyperoxia burden and associated in-hospital
mortality in critically ill patients undergoing
invasive mechanical ventilation for at least
7 days. Results showed that highest mean PaO2
values and highest PaO2 variability occurred on
the first day of mechanical ventilation. Continuous hyperoxia was observed in 18.1% of
patients or nearly one-fourth of time during the
whole observation period. Hyperoxia occurred
especially at low to moderate FiO2 settings in
younger patients with smaller SAPS2. After
propensity score matching, hyperoxia was not
associated with increased in-hospital mortality
or ICU mortality. More evidence is needed to
give clear advice on optimal individual O2 targets in critically ill patients during IMV.
