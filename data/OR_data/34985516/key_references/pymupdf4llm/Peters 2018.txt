**Abstract**
**Background: Oxygen saturation monitoring for children receiving respiratory support is standard worldwide. No ran-**
domised clinical trials have compared peripheral oxygen saturation ­(SpO2) targets for critically ill children. The harm of
interventions to raise ­SpO2 to > 94% may exceed their benefits.
**Methods: We undertook an open, parallel-group randomised trial of children > 38 weeks completed gestation and**
< 16 years of age receiving invasive or non-invasive respiratory support and supplemental oxygen who were admitted
urgently to one of three paediatric intensive care units. A ‘research without prior consent’ approach was employed.
Children were randomly assigned to a liberal oxygenation group ­(SpO2 targets > 94%) or a conservative oxygenation
group ­(SpO2 = 88–92% inclusive). Outcomes were measures of feasibility: recruitment rate, protocol adherence and
acceptability, between-group separation of ­SpO2 and safety. The Oxy-PICU trial was registered before recruitment:
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03040570.
**Results: A total of 159 children met the inclusion criteria, of whom 119 (75%) were randomised between April and**
July 2017, representing a rate of 10 patients per month per site. The mean time to randomisation from first contact
with an intensive care team was 1.9 (SD 2.2) h. Consent to continue in the study was obtained in 107 cases (90%);
the children’s parents/legal representatives were supportive of the consent process. The median (interquartile range,
IQR) of time-weighted individual mean ­SpO2 was 94.9% (92.6–97.1) in the conservative oxygenation group and 97.5%
(96.2–98.4) in the liberal group [difference 2.7%, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.3–4.0%, p < 0.001]. Median (IQR)
time-weighted individual mean ­FiO2 was 0.28 (0.24–0.37) in the conservative group and 0.37 (0.30–0.42) in the liberal
group (difference 0.08, 95% CI 0.03–0.13, p < 0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in length of
stay, duration of organ support or mortality. Two prespecified serious adverse events (cardiac arrests) occurred, both
in the liberal oxygenation group.
**Conclusion: A definitive clinical trial of peripheral oxygen saturation targets is feasible in critically ill children.**

**Introduction**
A main aim of resuscitation and intensive care is to
maintain appropriate and safe levels of tissue oxygenation [1–3]. However, as it is difficult to directly measure
tissue oxygen, estimates of peripheral oxygen saturation
­(SpO2) and arterial partial pressure are typically substituted. Invasive mechanical ventilation with supplemental
oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation and partial pressure is the most common organ support provided in
paediatric intensive care units (PICU). Around 70% of
UK PICU admissions are invasively mechanically ventilated, amounting to 14–15,000 children annually [4].
Globally, the figure is unknown, but is in the hundreds
of thousands. Despite these numbers, there is no highquality evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCTs)
to inform the optimal level of oxygen saturation for critically ill children receiving mechanical ventilation.
Current practice relating to oxygen saturation targets
varies widely in paediatric and adult intensive care units

[5, 6]. Clinicians prevent severe hypoxia wherever possible, but beyond this there is little consensus [7]. Indeed, a
fear of hypoxia leads many to target supra-normal values.
We previously described supra-physiological levels of
oxygenation as the norm on PICU; around one-third of
all recorded ­SpO2 values were 100% and more than 60%
of values were over 95% [8].
Associations between high levels of arterial oxygenation and worse outcomes have been described post-cardiac arrest [9, 10], during extra-corporeal oxygenation
for congenital heart disease [11], following stroke [12],
and in respiratory failure [13]. When added to the known
risks of severe hypoxia, a ‘U-shaped’ relationship between
arterial oxygenation and risk of death emerges [3]. We
observed an excess mortality (both crude and adjusted)
at extremes of oxygenation in 7410 critically ill children

[14]. A complex U-shaped relationship between oxygenation and outcome is biologically feasible and may arise
from the balance between harm from hypoxic injury at
one extreme and a combination of increased oxygen free
radical damage and iatrogenic injury from more aggressive treatments at the other [15].
Clinical trials of oxygen targets in extremely premature
infants have shown that they influence survival rates,
retinopathy rates, and costs, with large RCTs comparing lower (85–89%) with higher ­SpO2 targets (91–95%)

[16, 17]. Unexpectedly, an increased risk of death [relative risk 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.15–1.84;
_p_ = 0.002] was observed with the lower ­SpO2 targets [17].
In contrast, in adult critical illness, small trials indicate a
possible benefit of lower oxygenation targets [18, 19]. No
benefit or significant harm with supplemental oxygen has
been demonstrated in adults with ST elevation myocardial infarction [20–22].


The only paediatric trial data—in non-critically ill children with bronchiolitis—demonstrate equivalent safety
of a ­SpO2 target of > 90% when compared to > 94%. Later
hospital discharges were seen with the higher target
(ratio of length of stay 1.28, 95% CI 1.09–1.50, p = 0.003)

[23].
This pilot RCT was conducted to determine the safety
and feasibility of a definitive multicentre RCT comparing
current liberal targets for peripheral oxygen saturation
with more conservative targets in critically ill children.
The pilot RCT had the following objectives: (1) to test
the willingness of clinicians to screen, recruit and randomise eligible patients; (2) to estimate the recruitment
rate; (3) to test the acceptability of the deferred consenting procedures and participant information; (4) to test,
following randomisation, delivery of and adherence to,
the intervention and demonstrate separation between the
groups; (5) to test follow-up for the identified, potential,
patient-centred primary and other important secondary
outcome measures and for adverse event reporting; (6) to
inform final selection of a patient-centred primary outcome measure; and (7) to estimate the characteristics of
the selected patient-centred primary outcome measure
to inform sample size estimation. The underlying hypothesis is that the harm of interventions to raise peripheral
oxygen saturation to > 94% exceeds the benefits of these
interventions.

**Methods**
**Study design and oversight**
Oxy-PICU was a pragmatic, open, multi-centre RCT in
infants and children accepted for emergency admission
to one of three participating PICUs. Three units were
selected as representing typical configurations for UK
PICUs (general or combined general and cardiac units in
general academic medical centres or within stand-alone
children’s hospitals).
The trial was coordinated by the Intensive Care
National Audit and Research Centre Clinical Trials
Unit and sponsored by Great Ormond Street Hospital
for Children NHS Foundation Trust. Health Research
Authority (212228) and research ethics committee (16/
SC/0617) approval were obtained. The trial was registered prior to recruitment of the first patient on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03040570) and the protocol published

[24]. A trial steering committee, with a majority of independent members, and an independent data monitoring
and ethics committee were convened to oversee the pilot
trial on behalf of the sponsor.
A detailed description of the methods, including the
study protocol, has been published previously [24].

**Trial population and eligibility criteria**
Inclusion criteria were: more than 38 weeks corrected
gestational age and less than 16 years of age; within
the first 6 h of face-to-face contact with PICU staff or
transport team; an emergency admission accepted to a
participating PICU requiring invasive or non-invasive
respiratory support (including: invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation or high-flow humidified
oxygen therapy), and receiving supplemental oxygen for
abnormal gas exchange.
Mechanical ventilation was considered to include invasive and non-invasive ventilation and high-flow humidified oxygen.
Exclusion criteria were: death perceived as imminent;
brain pathology/injury as primary reason for admission
(e.g. traumatic brain injury, post-cardiac arrest, stroke,
convulsive status epilepticus); known pulmonary hypertension; known or suspected sickle cell disease; known or suspected uncorrected congenital cardiac disease; end-of-life
care plan in place with limitation of resuscitation; receiving
long-term mechanical ventilation prior to this admission;
or recruited to Oxy-PICU in a previous admission.

**Screening and randomisation**
Potentially eligible infants and children were screened
against the inclusion/exclusion criteria by the transport
team or PICU staff. Randomisation took place as soon
as eligibility was confirmed including during transport.
Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) via a secure
web-based system to either the conservative (88–92%) or
liberal (> 94%) peripheral oxygen saturation ­(SpO2) target group by a computer-generated dynamic procedure
(minimisation) with a random component (80% chance
of allocation to the group that minimises imbalance).
Minimisation was performed on: age (< 12 months vs.
≥ 12 months); study site; primary reason for admission
(lower respiratory tract infection vs. ‘other’); and severity
of abnormality of gas exchange (saturation to fraction of
inspired oxygen ratio < 221 with PEEP/CPAP > 5 cm ­H2O
vs. other).

**Trial interventions**
Participants received supplemental oxygen and ventilator
settings at the discretion of the treating clinical team with
the aim of maintaining ­SpO2 > 94% in the liberal oxygenation group and between 88 and 92% (inclusive) in the
conservative oxygen group until respiratory support was
discontinued during the PICU admission. All other care
was determined by the clinical team primarily responsible for the participant’s care. Data on oxygenation parameters and ventilator settings were recorded hourly from
randomisation to 24 h, every 4 h from 24 to 120 h (day 6)
and every 12 h from day 6 to the end of ventilation.


**Consent procedures**
We employed a ‘research without prior consent’ approach
as is appropriate in emergency situations where any delay
in commencing treatment allocation may be detrimental
and when the treatments being compared are within the
range of normal practice. A member of the research team
approached the parents/legal representatives as soon
as practical after randomisation to discuss the study, to
provide a participant information sheet (Supplementary
Material) and to seek consent for continued inclusion in
the study. If the participant was discharged or died prior
to their parents/legal representatives being approached,
then they were approached by an appropriate team
member at a later point either in person or by post with
an option to opt out from the study at this point. The
acceptability of this consent process was assessed with
a 12-question multiple-choice questionnaire provided to
parents/legal representatives following the approach for
consent (Supplementary Material).

**Outcome measures and statistics**
As it was a pilot RCT, no formal sample size calculations were performed, instead a sample size of 120 was
determined to be adequate to estimate candidate patientcentred outcome measures to a necessary degree of precision and to test the trial processes.
The following outcome measures were used to assess
the specified objectives. Objective 1: the proportion of
eligible patients recruited (target 50%), and distribution
of time to randomisation. Objective 2: the number of eligible patients recruited per month. Objective 3: the proportion of parents/legal representatives refusing deferred
consent. Objective 4: total time in ­SpO2 target range and
percentage of time in range, time-weighted mean ­SpO2,
and time-weighted mean ­FiO2. Objectives 5–7: characteristics and completeness of potential primary endpoints for a definitive study, including: length of PICU
stay, length of invasive ventilation, ventilator-free days at
day 30, duration of organ support, and PICU mortality;
and observed serious adverse events.
All analyses were carried out on an intention to treat
basis. Continuous variables were summarised as mean
(standard deviation) and median (interquartile range),
while categorical variables were summarised as number
(percentage).

**Results**
Between April and July 2017, 332 patients were screened
and deemed to meet the inclusion criteria. Of these,
170 patients met one or more of the exclusion criteria
and a further 40 were deemed eligible but were not randomised. Overall, 122 were randomised to the pilot RCT
(Fig. 1). Three patients were randomised in error. Two

were immediately removed from the study before receiving the intervention (one outside of age range, one randomised previously). One was removed from the study
within hours after being recognised as meeting the ‘brain


pathology as the main precipitant to admission’ exclusion
criterion. Therefore, 74.8% (119/159) of eligible patients
were appropriately randomised at a recruitment rate of
10 patients per month per site. Time to randomisation

from first contact was a mean (SD) of 1.9 (2.2) h. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the arms
(Table 1). Consent for continuation in the study was
subsequently declined in 9/119 patients (7.6%). Eight of
these cases were at a single study site. Three further cases
(3/119, 2.5%) did not continue in the study because we
were unable to seek consent (a suitable translator was
not available for one family and two children were subject to care orders). Forty-four (44/116 38%) completed
consent questionnaires were returned, 40/44 (91%)
reported being satisfied with the consent process, while
the remainder (4/44, 9%) were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied (Table 2). Full survey results including free text
comments are available in the supplementary material
(Tables S2 and S3). A total of 107 out of the 119 (89.9%)
correctly randomised patients were therefore analysed to
evaluate objectives 4–7.
The median (IQR) of time-weighted individual mean
­SpO2 was 94.9% (92.6–97.1) in the conservative group
and 97.5% (96.2–98.4) in the liberal group (difference in
medians of 2.7, 95% CI 1.3–4.0%, _p < 0.001) for the full_
duration of mechanical ventilation. Values for the first
24 h were similar: conservative 94.7% (93–97) versus liberal 97.4% (96.3–98.2), (difference 2.8, 95% CI 1.5–4.0,
_p < 0.001) (Fig._ 2). The median (IQR) time-weighted
individual ­FiO2 was 0.28 (0.24–0.37) in the conservative
group and 0.37 (0.30–0.42) in the liberal group (difference 0.08, 95% CI 0.03–0.13, p < 0.001) for the full duration of mechanical ventilation. The median (IQR) ­FiO2
values in the first 24 h were slightly higher: conservative
0.29 (0.25–0.37) and liberal 0.40 (0.31–0.5), (difference
0.11, 95% CI 0.05–0.17, p < 0.001).
Of all recorded ­FiO2 values, 36.4% (804/2210) were 0.21
in the conservative group compared to 13.0% (306/2347)
in the liberal group (Chi-squared _p < 0.001). In the first_

study participants in the conservative oxygenation group
spent a median (IQR) of 4.5 (1.0–10) h in the target range
compared to 22 (19–23) h in the liberal group.
Candidate patient-centred outcomes had high completion rates and were similar between groups. Detailed
characteristics are provided in Table 3. Two pre-specified
serious adverse events (cardiac arrests) occurred, both in
the liberal oxygenation group.

**Discussion**
In this multiple centre, parallel-group, pilot RCT, we
investigated the feasibility of conducting a large-scale
trial comparing conservative oxygenation ­(SpO2 88–92%)
with liberal oxygenation ­(SpO2 > 94%) in critically ill children receiving respiratory support.
We observed that the eligibility criteria were effective
in identifying patients and that clinicians were prepared
to randomise these patients. Our initial estimates of the
number of emergency admissions who met these criteria were shown to be very conservative, with recruitment being completed in approximately two-thirds of
the planned study time. Indeed, our study may have
further underestimated the true potential recruitment
rate because the study period did not include any winter months during which admissions in acute respiratory
failure predominate. The randomisation processes were
timely and effective with short intervals between first contact and randomisation. The high rates of recruitment of
eligible patients and low rates of consent being declined
are comparable with other emergency studies in critically ill children. Families’ feedback of the consent process
was both overwhelmingly supportive and in line with our


recent findings in the Fluids in Shock study [25]. The variability in consent rates by institution will inform our site
training for approaching families in a larger study.
The protocol achieved separation of the groups in
terms of ­SpO2 and ­FiO2 values. Our ­SpO2 values were
almost identical both in values and separations to those
achieved in the CLOSE study reported by the ANZIC
group in critically ill adults [18]. However, adherence
to the oxygenation target range was poor in the conservative group. This was especially clear in the first few
hours after randomisation. This may reflect the lack of
an option to reduce ­FiO2 below 0.4 on many paediatric
transport ventilators. In addition, many children clinically improved rapidly so that an ­SpO2 goal of 88–92%
was not achievable because they were already breathing
air. It may also be true that some bedside staff preferred
values of 100% based on previous usual practice, especially during episodes of chest physiotherapy or other
procedures. The pre-randomisation baseline ­SpO2 values
of 99% reinforce the extent to which normal practice is
for very liberal ­SpO2 values.
Further work with high-resolution (q5 s) analysis of
­SpO2 data is in progress to understand this behaviour,
with a view to further refining the protocol. A higher
baseline threshold ­FiO2 for inclusion (e.g. > 0.50) and
a recommendation for setting an upper ­SpO2 alarm
limit are simple protocol refinements that may further
improve adherence without a major impact on the other
trial processes.
Since this study was planned, a number of trials of oxygenation strategies in adults have reported or opened
for recruitment. The HYPER2S trial in adults with septic

shock employed a factorial design comparing an ­FiO2
1.0 with an ­SpO2 target of 88–95% alongside hypertonic
versus isotonic volume resuscitation. It was stopped
prematurely for safety concerns of increased weakness
and atelectasis in the hyperoxia group with a trend to
increased mortality [26]. The single-centre OxygenICU study observed reduced mortality with modestly
reduced oxygenation targets ­(SpO2 94–98 vs. 97–100%)

[19]. A number of larger studies are currently recruiting, including: evaluating the effects of two approaches
to oxygen therapy in intensive care unit patients requiring life support (ICU-ROx), ACTRN 12615000957594
by the ANZICS group, and handling oxygenation targets in the intensive care unit (HOT-ICU) in Denmark,
NCT03174002; optimal oxygenation in the intensive


care unit (O2-ICU) in the Netherlands, NCT02321072;
Liberal Oxygenation Versus Conservative Oxygenation in ARDS (LOCO2) in France NCT02713451 and
Targeted Oxygen therapy in Critical illness (TOXYC)
NCT03287466 in the UK. Maitland and colleagues are
conducting a large study of oxygen treatment thresholds
combined with a comparison of high flow versus low flow
oxygen delivery in east Africa, ISRCTN15622505 [27].
Our study shares a number of weaknesses with the
majority of these trials. Exclusion of cases with acute
encephalopathy or congenital cardiac disease limits the
generalisability of any findings to a subset of critically ill
children. These were felt to be necessary because of our
work scoping current practice and equipoise [7]. We did
not attempt to control oxygen therapy prior to PICU

referral. We did not attempt to blind clinical staff to the
group allocation. Our pragmatic approach means that clinicians were free to adopt different haemodynamic goals,
temperature control strategies or transfusion thresholds
that might alter the balance between oxygen delivery and
consumption independent of the ­SpO2 targets. These
multiple interactions may only be tractable with more
complex adaptive trial designs [28]. In addition, as a feasibility study, we cannot make any conclusions on the
effectiveness of conservative oxygenation.
There are also several strengths of Oxy-PICU beyond
it being the first report of a randomised comparison of
conservative and liberal oxygenation strategies in critically ill children. We have demonstrated a high degree of
engagement of clinical staff with the protocol across different units and transport teams. The trial processes were
acceptable to parents/legal representatives. No safety
issues were identified and there were trends across the
clinical outcomes for shorter durations of organ support


in the conservative group that might be suitable as outcome measures in a full trial.
Although the choice of primary outcome measure for a
definitive trial will involve consultation with patients and
families and considerations of cost, timings and competing studies, our data permit sample size estimations. For
example, a ‘ventilator-free days’ outcome with 90% power
to detect a 1.25-day difference in ventilation and no effect
on mortality would require a total of 2014 patients. These
pilot data support the feasibility of a trial on this scale in
critically-ill children.

**Conclusion**
This Oxy-PICU study has demonstrated that it is feasible
to conduct a large pragmatic clinical trial of conservative versus liberal oxygenation in critically ill children.
Considerations for a full trial include addition of an ­FiO2
threshold for inclusion, and a recommendation for an
upper ­SpO2 alarm limit in the conservative group.
