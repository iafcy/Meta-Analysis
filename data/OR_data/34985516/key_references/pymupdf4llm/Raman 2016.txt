Objective: To describe the relationship between Pao2 at intensive
care admission and mortality in critically ill children and to review
systematically the literature describing this relationship.
Design: Cohort study: A review of consecutive tertiary pediatric
intensive care admissions (January 2004 to December 2014) in a
single center. The relationship between admission Pao2 and crude
and standardized mortality was explored using nonlinear regression. Systematic review: A search of MEDLINE (1950 to January
2015), EMBASE (1980 to January 2015), Cochrane and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects databases was undertaken using the following terms: “hyperoxia,” “hypoxia,” “critically
ill children,” “pediatric intensive care,” “mortality,” and/or “survival.”
Setting: Tertiary PICU.
Patients: Patients younger than 18 years of age.
Interventions: The association of hyperoxia (Pao2, > 300 torr

[40 kPa]) and hypoxia (Pao2, < 60 torr [8 kPa] or peripheral oxygen saturations, < 90%) to mortality in critically ill children was
explored.
Measurements and Main Results: Cohort study: Of 14,321
admissions, 7,410 children had recorded Pao2 and Fio2 at admission. Crude mortality was 7.4% (555/7,410). This varied with
admission Pao2 from 15.4% (204/1,324) in the hypoxia group
(< 8 kPa) to 5.3% (287/5,385) with normoxia and 9.1% (64/701)
in the hyperoxic group (> 40 kPa). Nonlinear regression displayed

a “U-shaped” relationship between Pao2 and crude and case-mix
adjusted mortality. Systematic review: Fourteen studies and one
conference abstract were eligible for inclusion. Eleven studies
(n = 5,280) relate to hypoxia with combined odds ratio for death,
of 3.13 (95% CI, 1.79–5.48; p < 0.001) compared to normoxia.
Six studies (n = 2,012) relate to hyperoxia and suggest no effect
on mortality compared to normoxia (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% CI,
0.42–3.17; p = 0.77).
Conclusions: Hypoxia at admission is associated with increased
mortality in critically ill children, whereas the association with hyperoxia is less clear. The cohort study demonstrated a U-shaped association between admission Pao2 and mortality. Further examination
is needed to explore the effect of hyperoxia upon mortality prediction accuracy. (Pediatr Crit Care Med 2016; 17:e444–e450)

is associated with increased mortality following stroke, cardiac
arrest (CA), and traumatic brain injury (TBI) in critically ill
adults (5–7).
The true distribution of risk associated with levels of oxygenation during critical illness is likely to be complex. De Jonge
et al (8) reported a “U-shaped” relationship between early Pao2
and mortality in adult ICUs. Martin and Grocott (9) proposed “precise control of arterial oxygenation” and “permissive
hypoxemia” for optimizing risk and benefit of oxygen therapy
during critical illness. Avoidance of hyperoxia was safe in a randomized pilot trial of mechanical ventilated adults comparing
conservative (88–92%) and liberal (> 96%) oxygen saturation
targets (10). In infants with bronchiolitis, oxygen saturation
targets of greater than 90% were as safe as greater than 94%,
and required shorter durations of support (11).
There is no consensus on the ideal Pao2 in critically ill children. Here, we examine the hypothesis that the Pao2 at admission
does not influence risk-adjusted mortality in critically ill children
in a large cohort and through systematic review of the literature.

###### METHODS

**Cohort Study**
We reviewed prospectively collected data for all admissions to
the pediatric, neonatal, and cardiac critical care units at Great
Ormond Street Hospital over an 11-year period (January 2004
to December 2014).
Patients were included if they had a documented Pao2
and Fio2 at admission. The definitions of normoxia, hypoxia,
hyperoxia, and admission Pao2 reflect those used by Kilgannon
et al (12) and De Jonge et al (8).
The Pediatric index of Mortality (PIM) 2 score was recorded
and a modified PIM (mPIM) score was calculated for each
patient by excluding the coefficient of Fio2/Pao2 (F-to-P ratio)
from the logit equation. Patients were empirically categorized
into six groups according to their admission Pao2 (< 8, 8.1–10,
10.1–13, 13.1–25, 25.1–40, and > 40 kPa). Standardized mortality ratio (SMR), modified SMR (mSMR, calculated using
mPIM) and 95% CIs were calculated and plotted for each
group using PIM2 and mPIM.
Regression curve estimation (SPSS: IBM Software v21.0;
IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) was used to determine best-fit model
for the Pao2-mortality relationship. Nonlinear regression analysis with mortality as the outcome and admission Pao2, age,
ethnicity, weight, and mPIM2 as covariates was performed to
assess the relationship between oxygenation and crude and
case-mix adjusted mortality.

**Systematic Review**
The systematic review was performed following the “Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses”
guidelines (13). The inclusion criteria were as follows:

1) Age: 4 weeks to 18 years.
2) For the observation cohort, hyperoxia defined as Pao2
greater than 300 torr (40 kPa) or hypoxia defined as peripheral oxygen saturations less than 90% or Pao2 less than 60
torr (8 kPa).
3) For the comparison cohort, normoxia defined as Pao2
between 60 and 300 torr (8.1–40 kPa) or peripheral oxygen saturations greater than 90%. Alternative thresholds
were analyzed separately (Supplemental Digital Content 1,
[http://links.lww.com/PCC/A288).](http://links.lww.com/PCC/A288)
4) Randomized control trials (RCTs) or cohort studies.
5) Outcome measure: Mortality at hospital discharge.

**Search Strategy**
The terms “hyperoxia,” “hypoxia,” “survival,” and “critically ill
children” or “pediatric intensive care” and “mortality” (Supple**[mental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/PCC/A289;](http://links.lww.com/PCC/A289)**

ies in MEDLINE (1950 to January 2015), EMBASE (1980 to
January 2015), Cochrane and Database of Abstracts of Reviews
of Effects databases. The search was conducted in April 2015.


**Primary Summary Measure and Meta-Analysis**
A meta-analysis was performed with OpenMeta[Analyst]
software (14). _I[2] was used as the measure of consistency for_
heterogeneity analysis. For subgroup analysis, the studies were
divided into patients admitted with lower respiratory tract
infection (LRTI) or CA or TBI.

###### RESULTS

**Cohort Study**
Over the 11-year period, 7,410 of 14,321 admissions had a recorded
Pao2 in the first hour. Of these, 1,324 (17.8%) were hypoxic, 5,385
(72.6%) were normoxic, and 701 (9.4%) were hyperoxic at admission. The crude mortality was 204 (15.4%), 287 (5.3%), and 64
(9.1%), respectively. Pao2 and crude mortality was found to have
a quadratic (U-shaped) relationship using nonlinear regression
analysis with Pao2, age, gender, and mPIM as covariates. (Fig. 1)
The timing of death was described in Kaplan-Meier curves (Sup**[plemental Digital Content 5, http://links.lww.com/PCC/A292).](http://links.lww.com/PCC/A292)**
On the basis of the primary diagnosis at admission, the
patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease were identified
and separately analyzed. The _U-shaped relationship between_
Pao2 and crude mortality was preserved even in this subgroup
of children with cyanotic cardiac disorders (Supplemental
**[Digital Content 6, http://links.lww.com/PCC/A293).](http://links.lww.com/PCC/A293)**
The SMR and mSMR were 0.93 and 1.34 for the hypoxic
group (Pao2 <8 kPa), 0.75 and 0.83 for the normoxic group
(8–40 kPa), and 0.82 and 0.85 the hyperoxic group (> 40 kPa),
respectively. (Fig. 2)

###### DISCUSSION
Our cohort study demonstrates a quadratic (U-shaped)
relationship between admission Pao2 and mortality in
critically ill children. As the Pao2
increased the difference between
SMR and mSMR ceased to exist.
Thus, the influence of Pao2 on
PIM2 predicted risk of death
is higher in the hypoxic range
than the hyperoxic range. The
systematic review indicates
worse outcome with hypoxia
compared to normoxia.
Hypoxia has a detrimental effect in critically ill children. This effect has been best
described in the context of TBI
(30, 31). Our findings support
international recommendations
on the management of TBI in
children (32).
The effect of hyperoxia
on the outcome in various
critically ill patient subgroups
was recently reported (7, 33).
However, this relationship
lacks widespread agreement
(34). There was no evidence
of the increased mortality
with hyperoxia in the overall population of critically ill
children in our study. Of note,
the odds of death with hyperoxia increased insignificantly
in children admitted following
CA. This is consistent with the
adult reports (12).
The _U-shaped_ relationship between admission Pao2
and mortality from our study
differs from the inverse relationship between Pao2 and
mortality in the PIM2 model.
There may be two explanations

to this apparent dissimilarity. Although hyperoxic children
seem to have a higher crude mortality, the relationship may
not be causal. They are hyperoxic because clinicians recognize them as being sick and are reluctant to wean oxygen.
Alternatively, PIM2 may need to have a modified coefficient
for hypoxia and hyperoxia.

###### LIMITATIONS
The retrospective design and heterogeneous patient population with different mechanisms for hypoxia or hyperoxia make
interpretation of the results difficult. We focused on the relationship between Pao2 and mortality. While Pao2 is a marker
of alveolar gas exchange, tissue oxygen delivery is influenced
by various factors, including hematocrit, macro and microcirculatory variables. The effect of ventilatory strategy on Pao2
was not explored. We did not seek to investigate association
between Pao2 and attributed cause of death. We felt this analysis would be confounded by wide variability in practice in the
recorded cause of death.
A more detailed analysis of the distribution and severity of
organ failures with Pao2 would be of interest and will be the
subject of future work. However, we would hypothesize that
multiple organ failure would be present at both extremes—
since organ dysfunction can be secondary to hypoxia or
increased reactive oxygen species during hyperoxia. The picture is further complicated by the contribution from any iatrogenic injury from more aggressive treatments.
Finally, we accept that the mode of death and withdrawal of
care due to ongoing hypoxia may introduce bias to our association. In the systematic review, the possibility of selection
bias within each study is high. The funnel plots suggest some
reporting bias.
Nearly all the studies explore the relationship of Pao2 either
less than 60 torr (8 kPa) or greater than 300 torr (40 kPa) on
mortality suggesting an inherent bias in the setting up of Pao2
thresholds for the cohorts. Most of the studies included in this
review have small sample sizes (< 200 patients). This further
limits the generalizability of the results. However, despite these
limitations, our study would inform future studies in this area.

###### CONCLUSIONS
Our systematic review suggests that avoiding hypoxia is beneficial in all critically ill children, particularly in the TBI subgroup. Whether hyperoxia has an association with mortality is
not clear. Thresholds for hyperoxia may have to differ depending on age, pre-ICU condition, and the disease process among
other factors. Adequate oxygenation based on objective end
organ perfusion indices may be more important than a single
Pao2 value at admission to ICU. The cohort study displays a
_U-shaped admission Pao2-mortality relationship that warrants_
further scrutiny.
