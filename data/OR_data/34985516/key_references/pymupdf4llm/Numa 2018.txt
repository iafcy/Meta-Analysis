Objectives: To determine whether the association between hyperoxia and increased risk-adjusted mortality in adult intensive care
patients is also observed in a pediatric intensive care population.
Design: Single-center retrospective analysis of admissions to ICU
over a 5-year period commencing January 1, 2012, examining the
relationship between Pao2 measured within the first hour of admission and risk-adjusted mortality. Standardized mortality rates were
calculated using the Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and patients
were grouped into 50 mm Hg (6.67 kPa) Pao2 bands to assess
the relationship between initial Pao2 and risk-adjusted mortality.
Setting: Tertiary PICU with 17 beds and 1,100 annual admissions
located in metropolitan Sydney, Australia.
Patients: A total of 1,447 patients 0–18 years old with Pao2
recorded at admission to the ICU.
Interventions: None.
Measurements and Main Results: There were 5,176 patients
admitted to the ICU during the study period and 1,447 (28%) with
Pao2 recorded at admission. A U-shaped relationship between raw
mortality and admission Pao2 was observed, with lowest mortality
(2.3% and 2.6%, respectively) observed in the 101–150 (13.5–
20.0 kPa) and 151–200 mm Hg (20.1–26.7 kPa) bands and the
highest mortality observed in patients with Pao2 less than 50 mm
Hg (6.67 kPa) with mortality of 5.3%, or greater than 350 mm Hg
(46.7 kPa) with mortality of 18.2%. Hyperoxia at admission was
associated with an increase in risk-adjusted mortality, with polynomial regression indicating a strong correlation between Pao2

band and risk-adjusted outcome (r[2] = 0.845). When included in a
multivariate model that included the Pediatric Index of Mortality-3
variables, the odds ratio for hyperoxia (defined as Pao2 > 250 mm
Hg [33.3 kPa]) predicting death was 2.66 (p = 0.047).
Conclusions: In this single-center study, hyperoxia at admission to
the PICU was highly correlated with increased risk-adjusted mortality. Further investigation of these observations in a large multicenter
cohort is warranted. (Pediatr Crit Care Med 2018; 19:699–704)

he use of oxygen as a therapy for respiratory disorders was first proposed by Priestly (1) in the late 18th
century, and increasingly applied following Haldane's

# T

landmark paper published in 1917 (2). Haldane (2) recognized
the potential for harm from this newly described therapy and
went so far as to define a median lethal dose (LD50) of 12 weeks
exposure to 70% inspired oxygen in laboratory mice. Despite
the prescient warnings by Haldane (2), oxygen began to be
used liberally for a wide variety of respiratory and nonrespiratory disorders. Concerns regarding toxicity began to emerge in
the latter half of the 20th century. Prolonged exposure to high
concentrations of oxygen was recognized as a causative factor
for retinopathy of prematurity in 1952 (3), and in 1967, Nash
et al (4) were the first to describe “respirator lung” in adults,
which was postulated to be related to high inspired oxygen
concentrations (although was probably a combination of oxygen and pressure-/volume-related injury). Bronchopulmonary
dysplasia in neonates was reported contemporaneously (5).
Risks associated with the administration of supplemental
oxygen have more recently been recognized in specific patient
populations. Hyperoxia has been associated with increased
mortality following cardiac arrest (6–10) and increased early
myocardial injury and infarct size following acute myocardial infarction (11) although several other large trials failed to
demonstrate any deleterious effects (12, 13). Laboratory studies indicate proinflammatory and cytotoxic effects of hyperoxia on human cardiac myocytes (14). Hyperoxia has also

been linked to either worse outcomes or increased mortality
risk in retrospective studies of adult patients with trauma (15),
traumatic brain injury (16, 17), and stroke (18). In pediatric
subjects, a number of studies have indicated worse outcomes
following cardiac arrest (10, 19) and in patients requiring
extracorporeal support after cardiac surgery (20).
A number of recent studies in adult populations have demonstrated an association between hyperoxia and mortality in
general intensive care populations. In a large retrospective study
of 36,307 ventilated patients in 50 Dutch ICUs, de Jonge et al
(21) demonstrated a U-shaped relationship between Pao2 in the
first 24 hours (defined as the Pao2 from the blood gas with the
worst Pao2/Fio2 in that period) and mortality, an association
that remained significant after correction for illness severity
(Simplified Acute Physiology Score [SAPS] II) and demographic
variables. The lowest standardized mortality rate (SMR) was
observed in patients with a Pao2 in the range of 8.9–10.6 kPa
(65–80 mm Hg), with values below and above this range associated with higher SMRs. de Jonge et al (21) also demonstrated a
linear relationship between Fio2 and hospital mortality—with
higher Fio2 in the first 24 hours of admission associated with
increased mortality (after adjustment for Pao2/Fio2 and SAPS II
score)—thus suggesting a relationship between mortality and
both the concentration of oxygen administered to the patient
and the Pao2. A similar study performed in Australasian ICUs
(22) failed to demonstrate any relationship between Pao2 and
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)
III risk-adjusted mortality (although a _U-shaped curve was_
observed in both unadjusted data and SAPS II risk-adjusted
data). An interesting observation from this study was the high
prevalence of hyperoxia, with 49.8% of patients having at least
one Pao2 greater than 120 mm Hg (16.0 kPa) in the first 24 hours
of ICU care. Both Eastwood et al (22) and de Jonge et al (21)
focussed largely on a single measurement of Pao2 in the first
24 hours of ICU admission (at the time of the worst Pao2/Fio2
result). Cumulative exposure to oxygen over the course of an
ICU admission has also been examined. Helmerhorst et al (23)
analyzed 295,079 arterial blood gases in 14,441 ICU patients in
three tertiary ICUs in the Netherlands, using interpolation to
calculate an area under the curve representing total exposure
to hyperoxia over the first 24 and 96 hours of ICU stay as well
as the total duration of the ICU admission. Both duration of
exposure to mild hyperoxia (defined as Pao2 120–200 mm Hg

[16.0–26.7 kPa]) and severe hyperoxia (Pao2 > 200 mm Hg

[26.7 kPa]) demonstrated a linear relationship with APACHE
IV risk-adjusted mortality. Helmerhorst et al (23) also examined the relationship between first recorded Pao2 and riskadjusted mortality in this cohort, demonstrating a _U-shaped_
relationship similar to the findings by de Jonge et al (21).
Although an increasing body of evidence points to deleterious effects of hyperoxia in specific diagnostic subgroups in
both adults and children, as well as general adult ICU populations, no studies in mixed PICU patients have been reported.
This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship
between initial Pao2 and standardized mortality risk in patients
admitted to PICU.


##### MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was undertaken in the ICU at Sydney Children’s
Hospital, a 17-bed tertiary referral mixed medical and surgical
ICU located in metropolitan Sydney admitting approximately
1,100 patients per annum. Approval to conduct the study was
obtained from the local research ethics committee.
All admissions between January 1, 2012, and December 31,
2017, were eligible for inclusion and complete admission, and outcome data were available for all patients. Pao2 obtained within 1
hour of admission is routinely recorded for the Pediatric Index of
Mortality (PIM) calculation. For the purposes of this study, “admission Pao2” was defined as the first value recorded within the first 60
minutes of admission to the ICU. All patients with an admission
Pao2 value recorded were included in the study. The commencement date of January 1, 2012, was chosen as data recording for the
most recent version of PIM (version 3 [24]) commenced at this
time, allowing examination of initial Pao2 as a potential PIM variable. Patients were a priori assigned to groups delineated by 50 mm
Hg (6.67 kPa) Pao2 increments (i.e., 1–50 mm Hg, 51–100 mm
Hg, 101–150 mm Hg, and so on). Mortality was defined as death
occurring in the ICU or within 24 hours of discharge as per PIM-3.
The relationship between Pao2 and mortality was examined
using polynomial regression, and the impact of hyperoxia as
a potential PIM variable was analyzed using multiple logistic
regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
Data were analyzed using Wizard Statistics (version 1.9.13,
Evan Miller) and GraphPad Prism (version 7.0; GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA). Binomial proportions were compared
by chi-square testing, and standardized mortality was analyzed
using a Poisson distribution (25). Nonparametric data were
compared using the Mann-Whitney test.

##### RESULTS
There were 5,176 patients admitted to the ICU during the
study period, with an observed mortality of 126 (2.4%) and a
PIM-3–predicted mortality of 141.54 (SMR, 0.890; _p = 0.10)._
Median age was 1.7 years (interquartile range [IQR], 0.3–7.1
yr). A total of 1,447 patients (28% of all patients) had Pao2
recorded at admission to the ICU. Observed mortality in this
group was 58 (4.0%) with a predicted mortality of 72.08 (SMR,
0.805; p = 0.05). Admission Pao2 ranged from 14 to 613 mm Hg
(1.87–81.7 kPa) with a median of 144 mm Hg (19.2 kPa) (IQR,
99–202 mm Hg [13.2–26.9 kPa]). Admission Fio2 was recorded in
1,290 patients and ranged from 0.21 to 1.00 (median, 0.40; IQR,
0.30–0.51). A total of 1,021 patients (70.5%) received invasive or
noninvasive mechanical ventilatory support within the first hour
of admission. When compared with patients who did not have
Pao2 recorded at admission, patients in whom admission Pao2
was measured had significantly higher mortality (4.0% vs 1.8%;
_p < 0.001) were significantly older (median [IQR], 3.2 yr [0.7–_
10.2 yr] vs 1.3 yr [0.3–6.1 yr]; p < 0.001) and were more likely
to receive invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilatory support
within the first hour of admission (70.5% vs 41.2%; p < 0.001).
The most common admission diagnoses were broadly similar in the subgroup with Pao2 measured at admission compared with the entire cohort of intensive care patients. For

the entire ICU cohort, the top five diagnoses were bronchiolitis (n = 839), postoperative anterior or posterior craniotomy
(n = 270), postoperative cardiac surgery (n = 256), asthma
(n = 214), and seizure disorder (n = 211). Four of the top five
most common diagnoses for the entire cohort were also among
the top five diagnoses for the subgroup with Pao2 measured.
In this subgroup, the top five diagnoses were as follows: postoperative cardiac surgery (n = 245), postoperative anterior or
posterior craniotomy (n = 158), bronchiolitis (n = 67), postoperative spinal instrumentation (n = 66), and seizure disorder
(n = 51).
A significant proportion of patients were hyperoxic at
admission using commonly accepted definitions (22, 23).
Mild hyperoxia (Pao2, 121–200 mm Hg [16.1–26.7 kPa]) was
recorded in 512 of 1,447 patients (35.6%), and a further 401
(27.9%) had severe hyperoxia (Pao2, > 200 mm Hg [26.7 kPa]).
Mortality was calculated for patients in Pao2 bands of
50 mm Hg (6.67 kPa) (i.e., 1–50 mm Hg, 51–100 mm Hg,
101–151 mm Hg, and so on). Patients with Pao2 greater than
350 mm Hg (46.7 kPa) were grouped together because of
small number of patients in each 50 mm Hg band above this
value. A _U-shaped relationship between raw mortality and_
admission Pao2 was observed, with lowest mortality (2.30%
and 2.56%, respectively) observed in the 101–150 and 151–
200 mm Hg (13.5–20.0 and 20.1–26.7 kPa) bands (Table 1).
Although mortality was increased in patients with both low
and high Pao2, the highest mortality was observed in hyperoxic rather than hypoxic patients. Mortality in the lowest
band, Pao2 1–50 mm Hg (0.1–6.67 kPa), was 5.3% (2/38),
compared with 18.2% (8/44) in the group with Pao2 greater
than 350 mm Hg (46.7 kPa). Polynomial regression with 2 df
revealed a close correlation between admission Pao2 and ICU
mortality (r[2] = 0.981) (Fig. 1).
Adjusting mortality using PIM-3–generated similar results
in that hyperoxia (although not hypoxia) was associated with
an increased risk of mortality. Risk-adjusted mortality was
relatively constant up to a Pao2 of 250 mm Hg (33.3 kPa) with
SMR ranging from 0.58 to 0.69, but increased sharply at higher


Pao2 values with SMR of 1.0, 1.18, and 1.22 in the next three
Pao2 bands (Table 1). Once again, polynomial regression indicated a strong correlation between Pao2 band and risk-adjusted
outcome (r[2] = 0.845) for a second-order function (Fig. 2).
The single largest diagnostic group was patients admitted to
the ICU following cardiac surgery. Hyperoxia at admission to
the ICU is likely to be commonly observed in this group given
that they are all transferred from the operating theater, almost
invariably with high Fio2. Although the predicted mortality in
most postoperative cardiac patients is not substantially different to that of a general ICU cohort, the causes of mortality may
well be different, and a recent publication identified hyperoxia
as an independent risk for death in postoperative cardiac surgical patients requiring extracorporeal support (20). Removing
this subgroup from the analysis did not materially change the
results of the polynomial regression. In the cohort of patients
who were not admitted following cardiac surgery (n = 1,202),
both raw mortality and SMR were strongly associated with
Pao2 band (r[2] = 0.988 and 0.925, respectively). There was only
one death in the cardiac subgroup, making analysis by Pao2
band uninformative.
To determine if admission Pao2 has potential to improve
the accuracy of PIM, the effect of including Pao2 either as
a continuous or categorical variable in a PIM model was
explored. The polynomial regression curve for standardized
mortality suggested a value of Pao2 of 250 (33.3 kPa) as a suitable category discriminator. Both initial Pao2 (as a continuous
variable) and Pao2 category as defined above demonstrated
significant associations with mortality in univariate analysis
(p < 0.001), but the odds ratio (OR) for Pao2 category indicated a more robust association (8.47 for the dichotomous
category compared with 1.02 for Pao2 as a continuous variable). Adding a hyperoxia categorical variable into the existing PIM-3 score in multivariate analysis marginally improved
the performance of the score (area under ROC curve 0.956
compared with 0.951 without the hyperoxia variable; p = not
significant). In this multivariate model, the OR for hyperoxia
(defined as Pao2 > 250 mm Hg [33.3 kPa]) predicting death
was 2.66 (p = 0.047).
Diagnoses in nonsurvivors were observed to vary with Pao2
category. Shock was more common in patients with high initial Pao2, being present in five of 18 patients (27.8%) with Pao2
greater than 250 mm Hg (33.3 kPa) compared with three of 40
patients (7.5%) with Pao2 less than or equal to 250 mm Hg (33.3
kPa) (p = 0.04). Respiratory disorders trended toward being
less common in the hyperoxia category, being noted in 10/40
of patients (25.0%) with Pao2 less than or equal to 250 mm Hg
(33.3 kPa) compared with only one of 18 (5.6%) in patients
with Pao2 greater than 250 mm Hg (33.3 kPa) (p = 0.08).

##### DISCUSSION
An increasing body of evidence suggests that hyperoxia is associated with increased risk-adjusted mortality in adult intensive care patients. Reports to date have largely focussed on
either a single-point measurement of Pao2 in the first 24 hours
(obtained at the time of the worst Pao2/Fio2 result [21–23])

facilitating studies of association. Furthermore, if Pao2 at
admission does impact on
mortality risk, it can reasonably be proposed as a new
variable that may improve
the performance of predictive
indices. PIM already includes
an “oxygenation” variable,
Fio2:Pao2 ratio (24), but this
parameter reflects severity of
lung disease and will trend in

relationship with higher mortality observed at both low
and high Pao2 values. Using
SMR (rather than raw mortality) flattens this curve at
the lower Pao2 range but standardized mortality increases
in the upper Pao2 bands, particularly above 250 mm Hg
(33.3 kPa), indicating a failure of the PIM algorithm to

Pao2. Multivariate logistic

easily avoided. Correlation does not necessarily imply causation,
and other explanations can be proposed. Potentially confounding variables including the use of vasoactive and ventilatory
support, fluid resuscitation, and surgical and other procedural
interventions were not examined but could impact on the relationships observed in this study. The inherent selection bias of
including only patients who had Pao2 measured within an hour
of admission to the ICU suggests that our findings should not
necessarily be generalized to all pediatric intensive care patients.
It has been suggested that cumulative exposure to hyperoxia
during the course of an ICU stay may simply be a marker for
a lack of responsive care rather than a causative factor for bad
outcomes of itself (23), and our data suggest that there may be
associations between hyperoxia and particular diagnostic categories (e.g., sepsis) that carry high mortality risk. In this setting,
hyperoxia at admission to the ICU may simply be a marker for
severity of critical illness rather than a causative factor for poor
outcomes. Nevertheless, there is biological plausibility for hyperoxia to be injurious, particularly in critical illness (14, 28, 29).
An important finding in this study was the high incidence
of hyperoxia in patients admitted to ICU. This underscores a
widespread acceptance of high arterial oxygen saturation and
Pao2 values among medical staff, which may not be appropriate
given the emerging data. Given the prevalence of hyperoxia in
our patients, identification of any deleterious effect is of considerable importance, particularly as there is some evidence to suggest that limiting exposure to hyperoxia can reduce intensive care
and hospital mortality. A randomized controlled trial comparing
a conservative oxygen regimen (targeting Pao2 70–100 mm Hg

[9.3–13.3 kPa]) compared with a more liberal oxygen regimen
(allowing Pao2 up to 150 mm Hg [20 kPa]) was recently reported
from a single adult ICU in Italy (30), with a substantial reduction
in ICU mortality observed in conservative oxygen group—11.6%
compared with 20.2% in the more liberal oxygen group. A reduction in hospital (but not ICU) mortality was associated with the
introduction of a conservative oxygen regimen targeting Pao2
55–86 mm Hg (7.3–11.5 kPa) in 15,045 adult ICU patients (31).
Targeting moderately low Pao2 or saturation values (e.g., saturations of 88–92% in one recent study [32]) appears to be safe and
feasible in adult ICU populations, but there are no data in pediatric populations. Hypoxia is, obviously, potentially deleterious,
and any consideration of lower Pao2 or oxygen saturation targets
must be approached with considerable caution.

##### CONCLUSIONS
In this single-center study, hyperoxia at admission to the
PICU was common and was highly correlated with increased
risk-adjusted mortality, although it is not clear whether this
represents true causation. Further investigation of these observations in a large multicenter cohort is warranted.
