Objectives: Patients who require venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because of cardiac failure frequently have
supranormal blood oxygen tensions (hyperoxia). Recent studies have suggested worse outcomes in patients with hyperoxia
after resuscitation from cardiac or respiratory arrests, presumably
because of oxidative stress. There are limited data regarding the
effect of hyperoxia on outcomes in pediatric patients on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
Design: Retrospective chart review.
Setting: Pediatric cardiothoracic ICU.
Patients: Cardiac surgery patients less than 1 year old requiring
venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the postoperative period from 2007 to 2013.
Measurements and Main Results: In 93 infants (median time on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 5 d), mortality at 30 days post
surgery (primary outcome) was 38%. Using a receiver operating
characteristic curve, a mean Pao2 of 193 mm Hg in the first 48 hours
of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was determined to have
good discriminatory ability with regard to 30-day mortality. Univariate
analysis identified a mean Pao2 greater than 193 mm Hg (p = 0.001),
longer cardiopulmonary bypass times (p = 0.09), longer duration
of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (p < 0.0001), and higher
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation pump flows (p = 0.052) as
possible risk factors for 30-day mortality. In multivariable analysis

controlling for the variables listed above, a mean Pao2 greater
than 193 mm Hg remained an independent risk factor for mortality
(p = 0.03). In addition, a mean Pao2 greater than 193 mm Hg was
associated with the need for renal dialysis (p = 0.02) but not with
neurologic injury (p = 0.41) during the hospitalization.
Conclusions: In infants with congenital heart disease who are
placed on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
postoperatively, hyperoxia (defined as a mean Pao2 > 193 mm Hg
in the first 48 hr of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) was an
independent risk factor for 30-day mortality after surgery. Future
studies are needed to delineate the causative or associative role
of hyperoxia with outcomes, especially in children with baseline
cyanosis who may be more susceptible to the effects of oxidative
stress. (Pediatr Crit Care Med 2016; 17:350–358)

of all surgeries, and the overall mortality for patients is approximately 40–65% (1–3). Common indications for the use of ECMO
postoperatively include failure to wean from cardiopulmonary
bypass due to myocardial dysfunction, low cardiac output state,
cardiac or respiratory arrest, pulmonary hypertension, or shunt
occlusion. Postoperative patients are most often supported with
venoarterial ECMO (VA-ECMO) where deoxygenated blood is
removed from the venous side of the circulation and oxygenated
via the oxygenator resulting in highly oxygenated blood (Pao2,

- 400 mm Hg) returned directly to the arterial side of the circulation. The myocardium (via the coronary arteries) and other
organs such as the brain, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract
are, thus, exposed to these high levels of oxygen (hyperoxia).
Potential negative effects of hyperoxia include the generation of reactive oxygen species that leads to increased oxidative
stress and cellular damage as well as activation of neutrophils
and platelets leading to an exaggerated inflammatory and

thrombotic cascade (4). The effect of hyperoxia has been extensively studied in other clinical situations such as after resuscitation from cardiac arrest (5–10) or perinatal asphyxia (11, 12)
and after myocardial infarctions (13). Furthermore, in cyanotic
pediatric patients with congenital heart disease, decreasing the
amount of oxygen in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit to
match the patient’s preoperative Pao2 has been shown to lead
less end-organ damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress
compared with exposing the patients to Pao2 values between
150 and 200 mm Hg (14, 15).
Given the concern that hyperoxia may be harmful to patients
while on ECMO and the lack of data within this area, we aimed
to examine the potential effect of hyperoxia on infants who
were placed onto VA-ECMO after cardiac surgery.

##### MATERIALS AND METHODS
A retrospective chart review of all infants was performed
(< 1 yr old) who were placed onto VA-ECMO after surgery
for congenital heart disease from July 1, 2007, to June 30,
2013, at the University of Michigan. After study approval from
the Institutional Review Board, the internal ECMO registry
was reviewed and patients who met the inclusion criteria
were identified. Patients who were on ECMO preoperatively,
patients who were placed on ECMO greater than 30 days postoperatively, and patients who were supported on ECMO less
than 24 hours were excluded from the analysis. Electronic
charts and the internal congenital heart surgery database
were reviewed, and demographic and clinical data were collected. Surgical procedures were stratified based on complexity per the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the European
Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (STAT) Mortality
Categories (16). If available, the first arterial blood gas prior
to cannulation for ECMO was collected (if a patient was cannulated in the operating room, then the blood gas prior to
surgery was included). In addition, all arterial blood gases in
the first 48 hours after cannulation for ECMO were also collected. If individual patients were placed on ECMO multiple
times in their life or hospitalization, only data from the first
ECMO cannulation were collected.
The primary outcome was 30-day mortality after the initial surgery. Secondary outcomes included ICU length of stay,
hospital length of stay, in-hospital mortality, need for dialysis,
and neurologic injury during the hospitalization (defined as
seizure, stroke, or intracranial hemorrhage). If available, transthoracic echocardiograms performed within the first 48 hours
of cannulation on to ECMO were reviewed by an independent
physician specialized in echocardiography (S.T.O.) to evaluate
the amount of ventricular dysfunction.
With regard to ECMO support, from July 2007 to June
2010, silicone oxygenators from Medtronic (Minneapolis,
MN) were used. Starting in July 2010, the ECMO circuits used
Quadrox oxygenators from Maquet (Wayne, NJ). From July
2007 to March 2010, ECMO flows were provided by roller
pumps. Starting in April 2010, ECMO flow was provided by
centrifugal pumps. Ventilator settings were placed at “rest settings” to avoid barotrauma with an Fio2 of 21%. In patients


with systemic to pulmonary artery shunts, it is standard practice to leave the shunt patent in most cases unless there are significant issues with an elevated ratio of pulmonary to systemic
blood flow.
Descriptive statistics are reported as frequency with percentage for categorical variables and median with interquartile
range (IQR) for continuous variables. The maximum, median,
and mean Pao2 values in the first 48 hours on ECMO were calculated for each patient. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the area under the curves (AUCs) of each of
three Pao2 metrics were compared to determine the most predictive metric of Pao2 for the primary outcome. The optimal
cutoff of the selected metric of Pao2 in the first 48 hours was
then determined as the best combination of sensitivity and
specificity for significant discrimination of the primary outcome from the ROC curve. To ascertain the predictive ability
of the optimal cutoff, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were
calculated for the overall cohort and for subgroups of neonates and patients who underwent a Norwood procedure with
systemic to pulmonary artery shunt placement. Patient and
clinical characteristics were compared between patients based
on the primary outcome, using chi-square test or Fisher exact
test, as appropriate, for the categorical variables and Wilcoxon
signed rank test for continuous variables. Variables associated
with 30-day mortality in the univariate analysis (p < 0.1) were
included in the multivariable model to evaluate independent
associations of possible risk factors with 30-day mortality.
Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and their 95% CIs were
estimated using logistic regression. Finally, similar univariate comparisons between patients with mean Pao2 values in
the first 48 hours above and below the optimal cutoff were
made in patient and clinical characteristics and the secondary
outcomes. All analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

##### Results
A total of 93 patients were included in the study. Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. The median age at the time
of surgery was 7 days, and 75% were neonates. Eighty-five
percent of the patients had STAT scores of 4 or 5, and most
(88%) had preoperative cyanotic heart disease. Forty-five percent of patients were cannulated on to ECMO in the operating
room, and 66% of patients were placed on to ECMO less than
24 hours after surgery. The median length of time on ECMO
was 5 days. The most common indication for ECMO was failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass in the operating
room (47%), and the majority of patients (86%) were cannulated via the chest. Ten patients had the sweep gas intentionally
blended to achieve lower arterial oxygen tensions during the
study period. The median of the lowest Fio2 of the sweep gas
in the first 48 hours in these patients was 40% (IQR, 32.5–40).
There was 38% mortality at 30 days after surgery and 49% inhospital mortality. The median ICU length of stay was 22 days
(IQR, 16–44). Thirty-eight percent of patients required renal

dialysis, and 42% had evidence of neurologic injury (stroke,
seizures, or intracranial hemorrhage).
Arterial blood gases prior to cannulation for ECMO were
available in 83 patients. The median pH was 7.35 (IQR, 7.19–
7.39), Pao2 was 40.0 mm Hg (IQR, 32.8–62.2), and lactate was
3.5 mmol/L (IQR, 1.3–13.0).
The median number of arterial blood gas measurements in
the first 48 hours of ECMO was 15 (range, 4–28) across the entire
cohort. Using ROC curves, the mean Pao2 in the first 48 hours
was the most predictive metric for mortality 30 days after surgery
(AUC, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54–0.76) compared with other Pao2 metrics (AUC, 0.58 and 0.61 in maximum and median Pao2, respectively). A mean Pao2 of 193 mm Hg in the first 48 hours showed a
good discrimination between the outcomes, with a sensitivity of
97%, specificity of 33%, PPV of 47%, and NPV of 95%. Seventythree patients (78%) in the cohort had a mean Pao2 greater than
193 mm Hg in the first 48 hours of ECMO.
The mean Pao2 in the first 48 hours also demonstrated good
discriminatory abilities in the subgroups: AUC, 0.72 (95% CI,


0.60–0.84) in neonates and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.54–0.89) in patients
who underwent a Norwood procedure with a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt. In neonates, a mean Pao2 of 193 mm Hg
had a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 37%, and an NPV of
100%, whereas in patients who underwent a Norwood procedure, the cutoff had a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 50%,
and an NPV of 100%. The distribution of the mean Pao2 in the
first 48 hours with regard to the primary outcome is shown in
**Figure 1 for the overall cohort and the subgroups.**
In univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with
mortality 30 days after surgery included longer duration on
ECMO (p < 0.0001) and a mean Pao2 in the first 48 hours of
greater than 193 mm Hg (p = 0.001) (Table 1). With exclusion
of the patients who had the sweep gas blended, a mean Pao2
greater than 193 mm Hg was still significantly associated with
increased 30-day mortality (p = 0.001). Longer cardiopulmonary bypass times and higher minimum ECMO pump flows in
the first 48 hours trended toward a significant association with
30-day mortality (p = 0.09 and 0.052, respectively).

neonates (age < 30 d) (B), and neonates who underwent a Norwood procedure with a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt (C).


-----

In multivariable analysis, a mean Pao2 in the first 48 hours
greater than 193 mm Hg and longer duration on ECMO
remained independently associated with 30-day mortality
(Table 2).
The entire patient cohort was stratified by a mean Pao2
of 193 mm Hg in the first 48 hours, and patient and clinical
characteristics were compared (Table 3). Factors significantly
associated with a mean Pao2 in the first 48 hours greater
than 193 mm Hg included longer cardiopulmonary bypass
(p = 0.02) and aortic cross-clamp times (p = 0.01), longer duration on ECMO (p < 0.0001), and higher ECMO pump flows.
Ventricular function (normal or mildly depressed vs moderately or severely depressed) on an echocardiogram within
48 hours of cannulation was not associated with mean Pao2
values (p = 0.19).
In terms of end-organ disease, the prevalence of renal dialysis (p = 0.02) but not neurologic injury (p = 0.41) was significantly higher in the patients with a mean Pao2 greater than
193 mm Hg (Table 3).

##### DISCUSSION
In infants with congenital heart disease who are placed on VAECMO in the postoperative setting, hyperoxia (defined in this
study as a mean Pao2 > 193 mm Hg in the first 48 hr of ECMO)
was an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the potential
effects of hyperoxia on patients supported on ECMO. In this
study, we aimed to choose a narrow subset of patients given
the vast heterogeneity of clinical and surgical characteristics of
patients who are placed on ECMO and therefore the multiple
confounders that could contribute to outcomes. The patients
in this cohort are all infants who had cardiac surgery requiring
cardiopulmonary bypass for repair of congenital heart lesions.
We excluded patients without congenital heart disease or those


that were placed onto ECMO outside of the postoperative setting to limit confounders given that cardiopulmonary bypass
in infants is known to cause a significant systemic inflammatory response (17).
Overall, the majority of the patients in the cohort were neonates, and approximately a third of the patients underwent a
Norwood arch reconstruction with a systemic to pulmonary
artery shunt. These factors in addition to the fact that the
majority of patients had a STAT mortality score of 4 or 5 indicate that the cohort, as expected, is a high-risk patient group.
Longer duration on ECMO was found to be a risk factor for
mortality after congenital heart surgery, which is similar to
previously published data (18, 19).
There has been a considerable amount of interest recently
in the potential effects of hyperoxia during and after periods
of tissue ischemia. The introduction of high amounts of oxygen to previously ischemic tissues leads to the generation of
reactive oxygen species and activation of inflammatory pathways via cytokines (20). Reactive oxygen species lead to lipid
peroxidation and protein changes, which cause cell injury via
direct damage or apoptosis (21). The effect may be even more
pronounced in pediatric patients as neonates, and infants are
known to have immature antioxidant defenses and thus may be
more susceptible to the reactive oxygen species (22). In addition, the reactive oxygen species can activate neutrophils and
platelets leading to an exaggerated inflammatory and thrombotic response (4), which could theoretically increase the risk
of complications on ECMO.
A review of the current literature indicates that across a
wide variety of clinical scenarios and situations, the effect of
hyperoxia is unclear. After resuscitation from cardiac arrests,
hyperoxia in adults has been associated with increased risk of
mortality (9, 23). On the other hand, supplemental oxygen
therapy after myocardial infarctions was not shown to have

any clinically apparent effect (13). In pediatric patients, the
data are mixed as hyperoxia has been shown to be both associated (6, 8) and not associated with increased risk of mortality
(5, 7) after cardiac arrests. In neonates with asphyxia, hyperoxia was associated with increased mortality and risk of brain
injury (11, 12). Finally, in children undergoing cardiac surgery
to repair congenital heart lesions (which often necessitates a
period of tissue hypoxia during cardioplegic arrest of the heart
or during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest), patients on
cardiopulmonary bypass who were exposed to hyperoxia had
increased evidence of end-organ damage, oxidative stress, and
inflammation (14, 15).
There are also limited data to suggest that hyperoxia may
be beneficial in certain situations. In animal models, hyperoxia
after cardiac arrest was associated with improved myocardial
function (24) and also shown to be neuroprotective in cerebral ischemia (25). Early data in human subjects showed that
selective perfusion of coronary arteries with a hyperoxemic
solution resulted in improved left ventricular function (26);
however, subsequent studies have failed to show any significant effect (27).
As a result of the data suggesting the negative effects of
hyperoxia, there has been considerable interest in modifying
oxygen exposure to patients. Current resuscitation guidelines
in pediatrics and adults recommend titration of supplemental
oxygen after a cardiac arrest (28, 29). In patients supported on
VA-ECMO, clinicians can titrate (or blend) the oxygen content of the sweep gas of the oxygenator to achieve more “physiologic” Pao2 levels. However, the practice is not universal. Our
group conducted an informal survey of other pediatric cardiac
ICUs and found that two-thirds of units are titrating to goal
Pao2 levels, whereas the other third maintain elevated Pao2 levels. In our study, only a minority (11%) of patients had the
sweep gas blended (likely at supervising physician discretion)
at the end of the time period of the chart review. With both
inclusion and exclusion of this group of patients, a mean Pao2


greater than 193 mm Hg was associated with increased 30-day
mortality.
There are other factors that can contribute to changes in the
arterial oxygen tension in patients supported on VA-ECMO.
Rarely, mechanical issues with the oxygenator can lower the
Pao2 values. In addition, oxygen tension of blood ejected from
the systemic ventricle and the ratio of mixing of blood from
the systemic ventricle and the arterial ECMO cannula can
affect the overall arterial (and hence end organ) oxygen tension. Pulmonary venous desaturation from lung disease (common in postoperative patients on ECMO) or mixing at the
atrial and/or ventricular levels may cause relatively decreased
oxygen tension of the blood ejected from the systemic ventricle
in relation to blood returning from the arterial cannula. Most
patients in our study were cannulated for ECMO in the postoperative setting due to low cardiac output or failure to wean
from cardiopulmonary bypass and therefore likely had some
element of ventricular dysfunction. One could hypothesize
that a patient with better ventricular function would, therefore, eject more blood that has a relatively lower oxygen tension, thus mixing with the highly oxygenated blood from the
aortic cannula and leading to overall decreased oxygen tension.
However, in this study, when we analyzed available echocardiograms in the first 48 hours after ECMO cannulation, worse
ventricular function was not found to be significantly associated with a higher mean Pao2.
Another important factor is ECMO pump flow as higher
flows would presumably decrease the amount of pulmonary
venous return and therefore decrease preload to the systemic
ventricle. This could lead to decreased ejection of the “deoxygenated” blood into the aorta. Interestingly, when adjusting for
ECMO pump flow and other factors, a mean Pao2 greater than
193 mm Hg was still associated with increased risk of 30-day
mortality, suggesting that the association is not dependent
on the requirement for increased ECMO support. In addition, although we observed that higher ECMO pump flows


-----

trended toward a significant association with mortality in the
univariate analysis and patients with a higher average Pao2 had
significantly higher pump flows, higher ECMO pumps flows
were not an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality in
the multivariable analysis. Thus, there is some suggestion from
this study that elevated Pao2 levels may have a causative (due to
reactive oxygen species or other mechanisms) effect on clinical outcome versus simply being associative due to improved
clinical parameters. Although further studies are required to
delineate these phenomena, the results of this study showed
that hyperoxia has a very high sensitivity and NPV for mortality. As shown in the results, there were very few patients who
did not survive to 30 days after surgery with a mean Pao2 less
than 193 mm Hg.
Secondary outcomes, such as the need for dialysis or neurologic injury, were investigated to evaluate for potential
end-organ injury due to hyperoxia. There was no statistical
difference in terms of neurologic injury (seizures, intracranial
hemorrhage, or strokes). However, only a limited number of
patients in the cohort had brain MRI, which is considered to
be the standard evaluation of white-matter brain injury. Future
studies would be helpful to further evaluate brain matter
injury and neurodevelopmental outcomes of patients exposed
to hyperoxia while on ECMO.
The data did suggest that there was an increased risk for
the need for renal replacement therapy in those patients with
a mean Pao2 greater than 193 mm Hg. Previous studies have
also indicated that renal failure is a risk factor for death while
on ECMO (18). As discussed above, it is possible that the need
for dialysis could be due to the negative effects of hyperoxia
with generation of reactive oxygen species leading to worsening renal failure. However, it is also possible that the need for
dialysis was simply a marker of a more critically ill patient with
worse ventricular function and the need for higher ECMO
pump flows although these variables were not seen as independent risk factors.
Limitations of this study include the fact that it was a retrospective chart review performed at a single center and that
there may have been other important clinical variables that
could not be measured in a retrospective manner. Specifically,
data were not available or collected with regard to the total
oxygen delivery such as specific ventilator settings and the
variation in hemoglobin of each patient. In addition, variation
among individual intensivists with regard to clinical practice
of patients on ECMO may have contributed to confounding
data. Finally, due to the retrospective nature of the data collection, advanced data analysis using longitudinal mixed modeling to further define the relationship between Pao2 values and
outcomes could not be performed.

##### CONCLUSIONS
In the postoperative period, a mean Pao2 greater than 193 mm
Hg while on ECMO was an independent risk factor for mortality in infants with congenital heart disease. The results of
the study indicate that not only are future prospective studies necessary to investigate the effect of hyperoxia while on


ECMO but also that a change of practice in management of
these patients in many centers may be prudent. In addition,
we would propose that hyperoxia on ECMO may be used
as a tool for clinicians to prognosticate potential ventricular
recovery and the likelihood of survival after ECMO decannulation, which may influence decisions regarding further intervention or institution of long-term mechanical support (i.e.,
ventricular assist devices).
