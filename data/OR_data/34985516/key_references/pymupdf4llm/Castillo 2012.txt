Purpose: Arterial hyperoxia after resuscitation has been associated with increased mortality in adults.
The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that post-resuscitation hyperoxia and hypocapnia are

associated with increased mortality after resuscitation in pediatric patients.
Methods: We performed a prospective observational multicenter hospital-based study including 223
children aged between 1 month and 18 years who achieved return of spontaneous circulation after
in-hospital cardiac arrest and for whom arterial blood gas analysis data were available.

Results: After return of spontaneous circulation, 8.5% of patients had hyperoxia (defined as

PaO2 > 300 mmHg) and 26.5% hypoxia (defined as PaO2 < 60 mmHg). No statistical differences in mortality were observed when patients with hyperoxia (52.6%), hypoxia (42.4%), or normoxia (40.7%) (p = 0.61).
Hypocapnia (defined as PaCO2 < 30 mmHg) was observed in 13.5% of patients and hypercapnia (defined as

PaCO2 > 50 mmHg) in 27.6%. Patients with hypercapnia or hypocapnia had significantly higher mortality
(59.0% and 50.0%, respectively) than patients with normocapnia (33.1%) (p = 0.002). At 24 h after return of
spontaneous circulation, neither PaO2 nor PaCO2 values were associated with mortality. Multiple logis
tic regression analysis showed that hypercapnia (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.62–6.61; p = 0.001) and hypocapnia
(OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.04–7.05; p = 0.04) after return of spontaneous circulation were significant mortality

factors.
Conclusions: In children resuscitated from cardiac arrest, hyperoxemia after return of spontaneous circu
lation or 24 h later was not associated with mortality. On the other hand, hypercapnia and hypocapnia

were associated with higher mortality than normocapnia.

stabilisation interventions after initially successful resuscitation
must be improved in order to reverse post-CA syndrome.
Post-CA syndrome is the result of the prolonged period of
systemic ischaemia during CA and the subsequent reperfusion
response that occurs after resuscitation and ROSC.[8,9]

Previous studies in animals have shown that excessive oxygen
during the reperfusion period increases neuronal damage through
production of free radicals and mitochondrial injury.[10] Once ROSC
is achieved, ventilation with the minimum fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) required to maintain adequate oxygen saturation of
arterial blood (around 94%) may facilitate survival and favourable
neurological outcome.[11–16] Several clinical studies of adult patients
admitted to the intensive care unit after CA have analysed the


-----

influence of arterial hyperoxia on mortality and suggest that it
significantly increases the mortality.[17–19] However, data on the
potential influence of hyperoxia on the outcome of CA and resuscitation in children are lacking.
Conversely, hyperventilation is thought to worsen outcome
after ROSC, because it diminishes cerebral blood flow and increases
brain ischaemia[20–22]; nevertheless, no clinical data have been
published regarding the eventual influence of hypocapnia or hypercapnia on survival after CA.
We describe the incidence of hyperoxia, hypocapnia, and hypercapnia after ROSC and the outcome of children who suffered
in-hospital CA. Our main objective was to test the hypothesis that
hyperoxia and hypocapnia after ROSC are associated with increased
mortality in paediatric in-hospital CA.

**2.** **Methods**

The study population comprised patients from an ongoing multicentre study aged 1 month to 18 years who suffered in-hospital CA
and achieved ROSC between December 2007 and 2009. The inclusion criterion was to have had at least an arterial blood gas analysis
performed at ROSC and 24 h after CA. The study was approved
by the local institutional review boards. CA was defined as the
absence of a palpable central pulse, unresponsiveness, apnoea and
severe bradycardia of less than 60 bpm with poor perfusion in
infants requiring external cardiac compression and assisted ventilation.
The case report form included the following: patient-related
variables (age, sex and weight), cause of CA, personal background
characteristics of CA and resuscitation (type of CA, variables monitored, assisted ventilation or vasoactive drugs administered before
the CA and staff who performed the resuscitation manoeuvres and
procedures), first recorded electrocardiogram (ECG) rhythm, total
duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and first arterial blood gas analysis immediately after ROSC and 24 h after. The
outcome-related variable was clinical status at hospital discharge
(alive or dead).
Statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 15.0.1 (SPSS
Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous data are presented as either
mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range
as appropriate, based on the distribution of data; categorical
data are reported as proportions and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs).
For the purposes of this analysis, the cohort was divided into
three exposure groups defined a priori based on PaO2 in the first
arterial blood gas values obtained. Hyperoxia was defined as a PaO2
of 300 mmHg or greater (or a ratio of PaO2 to FiO2 (PaO2/FiO2)
>300); hypoxia was defined as a PaO2 of less than 60 mmHg or a
PaO2/FiO2 <200.
Hypercapnia was defined as a PaCO2 of less than 30 mmHg,
hypocapnia, as a PaCO2 of 50 mmHg or greater.
The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality, which
was compared between groups using the chi-squared test; the Bonferroni correction was applied when groups were compared in
pairs.
A scheduled secondary analysis of the results was performed in
order to detect patients at risk of hyperoxia, who might have been
undervalued using the limits presented above. For this purpose, a
lower PaO2 cut-off was considered to define hyperoxia: 200 mmHg
rather than 300 mmHg in a first approximation, and 100 mmHg
rather than 200 mmHg in a final step.
Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the
potential influence of each of the factors on mortality. All the
individual factors with statistical significance in the univariate


analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. The results are

expressed as odds ratio and 95% CIs. A p value <0.05 was considered
significant.

**3.** **Results**

Of a total of 543 in-hospital CA episodes registered, 386 (71%)
achieved ROSC. The study sample comprised the 223 patients
in whom arterial blood gas data after ROSC were available. The
baseline characteristics of patients are described in Table 1. We
found that 46.5% of patients were younger than 1 year and 59%
weighed less than 10 kg. CA occurred in the paediatric intensive
care unit in 64% of cases. Out of the 223 patients, 19 were classified as hyperoxic (8.5%) and 59 as hypoxic (26.5%) (Table 1 and
Fig. 1). Arterial blood gases were also recorded 24 h after CA in 173
patients.
In-hospital mortality was 40%. Patients with hyperoxia immediately after ROSC (PaO2 criteria) had higher mortality (52.6%)
than patients with hypoxia (42.4%) and than those with normoxia
(40.7%), although the differences were not statistically significant
(p = 0.61).
No significant differences in mortality were observed (PaO2 criteria) in the arterial blood gas analysis 24 h after CA – hyperoxia
33%, hypoxia 29.8% and normoxia 35.8% – although there were only
three patients in the hyperoxia group (Table 2).
In the secondary analysis, using a PaO2 > 200 mmHg as the
hyperoxia limit, no significant differences were recorded in mortality between patients with hyperoxia immediately after ROSC
(39%), those with hypoxia (42.4%) and those with normoxia (43.1%)
(p = 0.9). Likewise, although patients with hyperoxia 24 h after CA
had higher mortality rates (57.1%) than those with hypoxia (31.6%)
or normoxia (35.3%), the differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.16).
The results for mortality were similar when the hyperoxia limit
was placed at 100 mmHg: hyperoxia 41.8%, hypoxia 42.4% and normoxia 42.4% (p = 0.99).
In 203 of the 223 patients, FiO2 was registered simultaneously
with the arterial blood gas analysis when performed immediately
after ROSC, and in 152 when performed 24 h later. When groups
were compared according to PaO2/FiO2 criteria, patients with a
ratio above 300 had higher mortality (51.2%) than those with ratios
between 200 and 300 (32%) or below 200 (42.2%); however, once
again, the differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.29)
(Table 2).
Considering the results 24 h after the CA assay, the PaO2/FiO2
hypoxia group had higher mortality (41.8%) than the hyperoxia
group (24.2%) and the normoxia group (28.6%), although the difference was not significant (p = 0.14) (Table 2).
Arterial CO2 measurements were available immediately and
24 h after ROSC for 221 and 152 patients, respectively. Patients with
arterial hypercapnia or hypocapnia immediately after ROSC had
significantly higher mortality than patients with normal arterial
CO2 values (p = 0.002).
No statistically significant differences in mortality were found
between patients with hypercapnia and patients with hypocapnia
(59.0% vs. 50.0%; p = 1) or between those with hypocapnia and those
with normocapnia (50.0% vs. 33.1%; p = 0.371). However, mortality was significantly higher in the hypercapnia group than in the
normocapnia group (59.0% vs. 33.1%; p = 0.003).
In the assay 24 h after CA, the hypocapnia group had higher mortality rates (44.4%) than the normocapnia group (33.1%), although
the differences were not significant (p = 0.37) (Table 3).
The mortality of patients who presented hypercapnia and
hypoxia immediately after ROSC was 47.8% in comparison with the
rest of patients 36.8% (p = 0.29).

After adjusting for other factors in the multivariate analysis,
both hypercapnia and hypocapnia immediately after ROSC were
associated with mortality (Table 4).
Neither hyperoxia nor hypoxia was found to be a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality; when entered in the multivariate
model, they did not modify the regression coefficient.
In contrast, other risk factors that proved to be significantly
associated with a lower in-hospital death rate in multivariate logistic regression analysis were respiratory illness as cause of CA and
initial shockable rhythm.

**4.** **Discussion**

Resuscitation from CA does not end after ROSC. Post-ROSC care
has significant potential to prevent the early mortality caused
by haemodynamic instability and further injury at the cellular
level. The objectives of resuscitation include optimisation of cardiopulmonary function and systemic perfusion, identification of
the precipitating causes of the arrest, institution of measures to prevent recurrence of CA and administration of therapies that might
facilitate long-term survival.

4.1. Oxygenation after CA and outcome

The present study assessed the incidence of hyperoxia after paediatric in-hospital CA and its potential impact on mortality.
Arterial blood gas analysis performed immediately after ROSC
revealed considerable variation in oxygenation, even if parameters
were extended to PaO2 values of 200 and 100 mmHg.Post-ROSC
exposure to hyperoxia amongst our paediatric cohort was an
uncommon occurrence. Aetiology of in-hospital CA in our population was mostly due to respiratory, which could partly justify the
fact that hyperoxia was barely detected and lower than in adult
studies.[17–19]

Most patients were normoxaemic 24 h after CA; moreover, analysis of PaO2/FiO2 ratios showed that, at the time, most patients
needed high FiO2 administration to reach normal PaO2 values,
thus implying some kind of underlying pulmonary damage or an

alteration of the ventilation to perfusion relationship. Pulmonary
circulatory dysfunction can induce low arterial oxygen saturation
after ROSC. However, PaO2/FiO2 ratio values had no statistically
significant impact on survival immediately after ROSC or 24 h later.
A decrease in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 24 h showed a trend towards
increased mortality rates, although this difference did not achieve
statistical significance.
Post-CA syndrome is a complex clinical condition that
compromises survival after resuscitation and comprises
potential brain injury, myocardial dysfunction and systemic
ischaemia/reperfusion response.[8,9] Thus, after ROSC, goal-directed
interventions are required in order to improve outcome. Variations
in oxygenation and ventilation during CPR and after ROSC may
trigger the cascade of events that contributes to tissue re-perfusion
damage.[8,9] Oxidative stress is believed to result from a surge of
reactive oxygen species, which could be favoured by a persistently
hyperoxic environment.[10–15] Kilgannon et al.[17,19] found that, in an
adult in-hospital CA sample, mortality was significantly higher in
patients with hyperoxia after resuscitation. However, in contrast
with our findings, most patients in that study were hypoxic, and
no data were reported on the temporal relationship between blood
gas analysis and ROSC.[17,19] Our results suggest that, in children,
even after conducting CPR with 100% oxygen, the incidence of
hyperoxia immediately after ROSC is low and becomes very rare
24 h after CA. These results are consistent with those of Bellomo
et al.,[18] whose study of adults who had suffered non-traumatic
CA showed hyperoxia as a rare event, occurring in 10.6% of their
sample.
Kilgannon et al. established the hyperoxia limit at
PaO2 > 300 mmHg and concluded that hyperoxia in intensive
care patients after CA was independently associated with
increased in-hospital mortality, which worsened in cases with
PaO2 > 400 mmHg.
On the other hand, Bellomo et al.[18] did not observe a robust
relationship between hyperoxia and mortality with the 300 or
400 mmHg limits. PaO2 values did not remain associated with hospital mortality when the data were adjusted for relevant covariates
such as concomitant illnesses and Acute Physiology and Chronic
Health Evaluation (APACHE) scores.
In our study, arterial hyperoxia following CA was not associated with increased hospital mortality in children; furthermore,
after adjustments for covariates, neither PaO2 values nor PaO2/FiO2
ratios influenced the odds ratio for mortality.
We found that paediatric patients were more likely to be normoxic after ROSC and remain as such during the first 24 h after CA.
This finding contrasts with the observations in adults made by Kilgannon et al.[17] and Bellomo et al.,[18] who found that 73.5% and 63%
of patients, respectively, were hypoxaemic at the time.
Paediatric CA aetiology is different from adult CA. It is known
that after acute coronary syndrome or acute myocardial infarction,
hyperoxia causes coronary vasoconstriction, decreased myocardial
blood flow and decreased myocardial oxygen consumption.[11,12]

Therefore, the co-morbidity of acute coronary syndrome could be a


-----

mechanism by which post-CA hyperoxia could worsen survival in
adults when compared to children.

4.2. Ventilation after CA and outcome

Studies in pigs demonstrated that excessive ventilation rates
significantly decreased coronary perfusion pressures and survival
rates when CPR was conducted after inducing ventricular fibrillation in an adult CA model.[20–22] Increased ventilation rates and
increased duration of ventilation are believed to impede venous
blood return to the heart, thus decreasing coronary perfusion pressure during CPR. Furthermore, a direct and immediate transfer of
the increase in intra-thoracic pressure to the cranial cavity with
positive pressure ventilation reduces cerebral perfusion pressure.
However, the results of these CA adult model studies should be
interpreted with caution, as they focus on the influence of ventilation on the interruption of chest compression rather than on the
impact of ventilation status according to arterial CO2 values.
As shown in our sample, respiratory illnesses are one of the main
causes of CA in children. Given the high incidence of underlying respiratory diseases and respiratory arrest before CA, children might
develop hypercapnia more frequently than adults. This could also
explain, at least in part, the low incidence of hypocapnia immediately after ROSC in our sample.
Recently published studies based on a paediatric animal model
of CA with asphyxia also found the incidence of hypocapnia to be
very low. Moreover, the animals barely achieved normal ventilation
parameters and presented hypercapnia despite being ventilated at
rates higher than those recommended by guidelines.[23–27]

Therefore, the optimal ventilation rate for resuscitation of CA
and after ROSC in paediatric patients has yet to be defined.[27] Our
study, which is the first to assess PaCO2 values after ROSC in
children, suggests that ventilation following current International
Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) guidelines generally
results in normocarbia or hypercapnia. It is noteworthy that excessive ventilation is a rare event in paediatric resuscitation (detected
in <15% of our patients).
Children with normocapnia showed lower mortality than those
with hypercapnia or hypocapnia in the univariate analysis. Furthermore, after adjusting for other significant variables in the
multiple logistic regression analysis, hypocapnia and hypercapnia
were associated with higher mortality.
Patients with hypoxia and hypercapnia presented nonsignificant higher mortality than the rest of patients, although only
23 patients presented hypoxia and hypercapnia.
On the other hand our data showed that patients with CA secondary to respiratory illness and initial defibrillation rhythms have
better survival. These factors have been previously described in
other studies.[1–7]

Our study has several limitations. First, it is an observational
study with no planned intervention; therefore, no causal relationship could be inferred from the results. Second, the exact limits
for defining excessive oxygen exposure are unknown; based on
previous studies, we defined hyperoxia as a PaO2 of 300 mmHg
or greater,[17–19] and, although other PaO2 values were considered
in the secondary analysis, their possible influence on our results
remains uncertain. Third, the number of children with hyperoxia
was low, a finding that could account for the absence of significant differences in outcome. In addition, measurement of arterial
blood gases cannot be considered a reliable marker of interstitial
or cellular oxygen tension. Further studies are needed to determine
the extent of tissue and cellular hypoxia and the associated oxygen
requirements during and after resuscitation.
Although characteristics of our patients, including prior heart
disease, were taken into consideration, those with congenital intracardiac shunt were not stratified, and this could have biased


our results. The influence of temperature was not taken into

consideration either, as hypothermia was an uncommon practice
in paediatric post-ROSC care during the recruitment period and
therapeutic hypothermia was not intended in most of our patients.
Another noteworthy limitation is that long-term outcome has
not yet been assessed. We acknowledge that hyperoxia could be
associated with brain injury and neurological impairment, as well
as with extracerebral deleterious consequences not analysed in our
study.

**5.** **Conclusions**

Most children who suffer in-hospital CA, although resuscitated
with 100% FiO2, are not exposed to arterial hyperoxia immediately
after ROSC or 24 h later. Arterial hyperoxia at these time points was
not associated with mortality in children. Ventilation during CPR
and after ROSC achieves normal PaCO2 values in most paediatric
patients. Hypercapnia after ROSC is more frequent than hypocapnia
and both could be associated with higher mortality.
Although targeting normal PaO2 and PaCO2 could be important
for preventing further damage by post-CA syndrome in children,
definitive clinical trials are needed to determine the impact of these
strategies on survival and outcome in children who suffer CA.
