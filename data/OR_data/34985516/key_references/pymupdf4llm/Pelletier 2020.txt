#### Maximum Pao2 in the First 72 Hours of Intensive Care Is Associated With Risk-Adjusted Mortality in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Mechanical Ventilation

Abstract: A relationship between Pao2 and mortality has previously been
observed in single-center studies. We performed a retrospective cohort
study of the Pediatric Health Information System plus database including patients less than or equal to 21 years old admitted to a medical or
cardiac ICU who received invasive ventilation within 72 hours of admission. We trained and validated a multivariable logistic regression mortality
prediction model with very good discrimination (C-statistic, 0.86; 95%
CI, 0.79–0.92; area under the precision-recall curve, 0.39) and acceptable calibration (standardized mortality ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.75–1.23;
calibration belt p = 0.07). Maximum Pao2 measurements demonstrated
a parabolic (“U-shaped”) relationship with PICU mortality (Box-Tidwell
_p < 0.01). Maximum Pao2 was a statistically significant predictor of_
risk-adjusted mortality (standardized odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.23–
1.32; p < 0.001). This analysis is the first multicenter pediatric study to
identify a relationship between the extremes in Pao2 values and PICU
mortality. Clinicians should remain judicious in the use of oxygen when
caring for children.

ecently, there has been increasing interest in hyperoxemia.
Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses
of oxygen management strategies in adults have come to
differing conclusions regarding the importance of hyperoxemia R
(1–3). While fewer data exist for children, there is a growing body
of literature identifying a relationship between the Pao2 values
and mortality in PICU settings (4–7). Limitations of these previous studies include data from single centers, variable definitions of
hyperoxemia, and absent or uncalibrated risk-adjustment strategies. Our objective was to examine the relationship between the
Pao2 values and mortality among critically ill children in a large
multicenter cohort, adjusting with a well-calibrated mortality risk
model. We hypothesized that both hypoxemia and hyperoxemia
would demonstrate an association with risk-adjusted mortality.

## Explorations

#### MATERIALS AND METHODS

We performed a retrospective cohort study of the Pediatric Health
Information System plus (PHIS+) database, a collection of federated electronic health record data containing laboratory results
and quality-controlled administrative data from six large pediatric
hospitals between 2010 and 2012 (8). We included patients with
21 years old or younger that were admitted to a pediatric general
or cardiac ICU with a hospital discharge date between January 1,
2010, and December 31, 2012, who received invasive mechanical
ventilation within 72 hours of admission and who had at least one
Pao2 value obtained. We excluded patients who were admitted to a
neonatal ICU or who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The study
was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review
Board.
Because prior work has suggested a parabolic (“U-shaped”)
relationship between Pao2 and mortality (5, 6), we performed a
Box-Tidwell test. We developed a multivariable logistic regression model of predicted mortality, with a random effect for hospital, and plotted the expected and actual mortalities of patients
grouped by differing maximum Pao2 values using bin widths
of 100 mm Hg. The variables used in the mortality prediction
model are listed in **Table 1. We divided the cohort into 80%**
training and 20% testing subsets. Backward stepwise selection was performed, taking variables with _p value of less than_
0.05 as statistically significant. Discrimination was assessed
using _C-statistics with DeLong 95% CIs and area under the_
precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Calibration was assessed with
standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) with Hosmer 95% CI and
calibration belts, with _p value of greater than or equal to 0.05_
deemed acceptable (9). Because the relationship between Pao2
and mortality was nonlinear, we performed polynomial (parabolic) regression. This approach is similar to standard logistic
regression, but allows the demonstration of the “U-shaped”
relationship between the patients’ maximum Pao2 value and
risk-adjusted mortality (with all other variables in the model
taken into account), and calculation of where the lowest riskadjusted mortality occurred.
We conducted five sensitivity analyses. First, we excluded
patients with a cardiovascular complex chronic condition flag
(10). Second, we excluded patients with burns, carbon monoxide
poisoning, or traumatic brain injury. Third, we excluded patients
with cardiac arrest prior to admission. Fourth, because prior work
has suggested a time-dependent effect of hyperoxemia (4–7), we
restricted the cohort to patients with invasive mechanical ventilation and Pao2 measurements within 24 hours of admission. Fifth,
we broadened the cohort to include patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation and Pao2 measurements at any time
during admission. All analyses were performed in R (Versions
3.5.1 and 4.0.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria).

#### RESULTS

Cohort demographics are listed in Table 1. The mortality prediction model had very good discrimination (C-statistic, 0.86; 95% CI,
0.79–0.92; AUPRC, 0.39) and acceptable calibration (SMR, 0.96;
95% CI, 0.75–1.23; calibration belt p = 0.07). The Box-Tidwell test
indicated that the relationship between Pao2 and mortality was
nonlinear (p < 0.01). The relationship between maximum Pao2


and mortality is shown in Figure 1. Predicted and actual mortalities are shown on the left axis, and the effect plot of maximum Pao2
measurement with 95% CI is shown on the right axis. Maximum
Pao2 had a statistically significant effect on risk-adjusted mortality. We observed a parabolic (“U-shaped”) relationship between
maximum Pao2 and unadjusted mortality. Both absolute and riskadjusted mortalities fell until a maximum Pao2 value of 384mm

(4–7). Together, these results suggest
that both hypoxemia and extreme
hyperoxemia are associated with
risk-adjusted mortality; however, the
precise thresholds associated with
clinical harm remain uncertain and
likely vary by clinical condition (4–
7). A recent randomized controlled
trial among adults demonstrated no
difference between conservative and
liberal oxygen management strategies (3). However, the highest Pao2
measurements in the liberal oxygen
therapy group from that study were
less than 150 mm Hg. In contrast,
the present study and several prior
pediatric studies (4–7) have demonstrated a significant association only
with either extreme hyperoxemia
and death. In the present study, the
optimal maximum Pao2 value in the
first 72 hours of mechanical ventilation appears to be between 100 and

that are not captured by the variables listed in Table 1. Finally,
bin widths of 100 mm Hg were chosen to ensure adequate sample
size in each bin (e.g., using a bin width of 50 mm Hg would have
resulted in zero patients with a maximum Pao2 between 450 and
499 mm Hg). Exploratory analyses did not suggest that smaller bin
widths would have altered the analysis findings (e.g., patients with
maximum Pao2 values of < 50 and 50–99 mm Hg had mortalities of 8.2% and 8.0%, respectively). However, the precision of the
binned analysis is limited by sample size.
The present work is the first multicenter pediatric study to confirm a parabolic relationship between the Pao2 values and riskadjusted PICU mortality. Maximum Pao2 values less than 100 or
greater than or equal to 400 mm Hg were associated with increased
mortality among invasively ventilated patients. While a prospective study is necessary to determine whether a causal relationship
exists, the present results suggest clinicians should be judicious in
the use of high Fio2 therapy in the absence of a specific indication.
