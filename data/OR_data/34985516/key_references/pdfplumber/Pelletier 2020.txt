(4–7). Together, these results suggest
that both hypoxemia and extreme
hyperoxemia are associated with
risk-adjusted mortality; however, the
precise thresholds associated with
clinical harm remain uncertain and
likely vary by clinical condition (4–
7). A recent randomized controlled
trial among adults demonstrated no
difference between conservative and
liberal oxygen management strate-
gies (3). However, the highest Pao

the present study and several prior
pediatric studies (4–7) have demon-
strated a significant association only
with either extreme hyperoxemia
and death. In the present study, the
optimal maximum Pao value in the

first 72 hours of mechanical ventila-
tion appears to be between 100 and
400 mm Hg.
