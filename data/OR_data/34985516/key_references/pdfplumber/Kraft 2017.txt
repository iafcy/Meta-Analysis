increased in-hospital mortality.
Editorial comment
Exposure to high inspired oxygen levels over many days is thought to be potentially injurious. In
this retrospective analysis, at least one week’s high inspired oxygen in critically ill ventilated
patients did not show increased risk for in-hospital mortality or length of stay, compared to a
matched cohort with no hyperoxia exposure.

that hyperoxic episodes predominantly occurred

In contrast to former studies, we did not investi-

mean PaO over time. Also, the studied ICU

determine hyperoxic burden of ICU patients.9
With the given study design, we could iden-
tify patients being exposed to hyperoxia beyond
doubt. ABG results showed that intraday vari-
ability and mean PaO values were highest on
2
the first day of observation period with 184
patients (43.9%) presenting hyperoxia. This
finding is similar to another study reporting
49.8% of hyperoxic patients on first day of ICU
admission.5 Only including data from the first
day of admission could have been misleading
on the actual exposure to hyperoxia of patients.
We could show that continuous hyperoxia, in
terms of time-weighted mean of PaO > 16 kPa,
2
occurred in 23.7% during the entire observation
period. These findings demonstrate that hyper-
oxia frequently occurs in ICU patients, despite
