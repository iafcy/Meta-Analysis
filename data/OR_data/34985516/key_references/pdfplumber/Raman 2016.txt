DISCUSSION
Our cohort study demon-
strates a quadratic (U-shaped)
relationship between admis-
sion Pao and mortality in
2
critically ill children. As the Pao

tal effect in critically ill chil-
dren. This effect has been best
described in the context of TBI
(30, 31). Our findings support
international recommendations
on the management of TBI in
children (32).
The effect of hyperoxia
on the outcome in various
critically ill patient subgroups
was recently reported (7, 33).
However, this relationship
lacks widespread agreement
(34). There was no evidence
of the increased mortality
with hyperoxia in the over-
all population of critically ill
children in our study. Of note,
the odds of death with hyper-
oxia increased insignificantly
in children admitted following
CA. This is consistent with the
adult reports (12).
The U-shaped relation-
ship between admission Pao

and mortality from our study
differs from the inverse rela-
