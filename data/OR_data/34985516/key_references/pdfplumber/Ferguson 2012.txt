Relationship Between Arterial Partial Oxygen Pressure
After Resuscitation From Cardiac Arrest and Mortality
in Children
Lee P. Ferguson, MBChB; Andrew Durward, FCP; Shane M. Tibby, MSc, MBChB
Background—Observational studies in adults have shown a worse outcome associated with hyperoxia after resuscitation
from cardiac arrest. Extrapolating from adult data, current pediatric resuscitation guidelines recommend avoiding
hyperoxia. We investigated the relationship between arterial partial oxygen pressure and survival in patients admitted
to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after cardiac arrest.
Methods and Results—We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Intensive Care Audit Network
(PICANet) database between 2003 and 2010 (n(cid:1)122521). Patients aged (cid:2)16 years with documented cardiac arrest
preceding PICU admission and arterial blood gas analysis taken within 1 hour of PICU admission were included. The

more pronounced in the presence of congenital heart disease.
Conclusions—Both severe hypoxia and, to a lesser extent, hyperoxia are associated with an increased risk of death after
PICU admission after cardiac arrest. (Circulation. 2012;126:335-342.)
