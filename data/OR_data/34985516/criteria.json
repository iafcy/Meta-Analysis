Full-text articles on potentially eligible studies were retrieved and checked independently for eligibility. Eligible studies were those including patients admitted to the PICU that examined hyperoxia and contained at least 1 outcome of interest. No predefined inclusion criteria were made for the definition of hyperoxia. Only clinical trials and cohort studies were selected. Studies that included only patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease were excluded, as were conference abstracts.",
