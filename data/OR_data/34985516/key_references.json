Hyperoxia was frequent, affecting 54% of patients. Normoxia was documented in 34% and hypoxia in 22% of patients. These percentages account for a 10% overlap of patients who had both hyperoxia and hypoxia. Ventilation status was more evenly distributed with hyperventilation observed in 38%, normoventilation in 29%, and hypoventilation in 46%, with a 13% overlap of patients who had both hyperventilation and hypoventilation. Derangements in both oxygenation and ventilation were common early after cardiac arrest such that both normoxia and normocarbia were documented in only 25 patients (13%). Neither oxygenation nor ventilation status was associated with outcome. After controlling for potential confounders, arrest location and rhythm were significantly associated with worse outcome; however, hyperoxia was not (odds ratio for good outcome, 1.02 [0.46, 2.84]; p = 0.96).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDespite recent resuscitation guidelines that advocate maintenance of normoxia and normoventilation after pediatric cardiac arrest, this is uncommonly achieved in practice. Although we did not demonstrate an association between hyperoxia and worse outcome, the small proportion of patients kept within normal ranges limited our power. Preclinical data suggesting potential harm with hyperoxia remain compelling, and further investigation, including prospective, large studies involving robust recording of physiological derangements, is necessary to further advance our understanding of this important topic.\n",

Functional status at hospital discharge was evaluated among survivors using the Functional Status Scale.\n## MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nOf 484 patients, 420 (86.7%) had venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and 64 (13.2%) venovenous; 69 (14.2%) had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiated during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Hyperoxia occurred in 331 (68.4%) and hypocapnia in 98 (20.2%). Hyperoxic patients had higher mortality than patients without hyperoxia (167 [50.5%] vs 48 [31.4%]; p < 0.001), but no difference in functional status among survivors. Hypocapnic patients were more likely to have a neurologic event (49 [50.0%] vs 143 (37.0%]; p = 0.021) or hepatic dysfunction (49 [50.0%] vs 121 [31.3%]; p < 0.001) than patients without hypocapnia, but no difference in mortality or functional status among survivors. On multivariable analysis, factors independently associated with increased mortality included highest PaO2 and highest blood lactate concentration in the first 48 hours of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and being a preterm neonate. Factors independently associated with lower mortality included meconium aspiration syndrome.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nHyperoxia is common during pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and associated with mortality. Hypocapnia appears to occur less often and although associated with complications, an association with mortality was not observed.\n",

Patients with hypercapnia or hypocapnia had significantly higher mortality (59.0% and 50.0%, respectively) than patients with normocapnia (33.1%) (p=0.002). At 24h after return of spontaneous circulation, neither PaO(2) nor PaCO(2) values were associated with mortality.

On the other hand, hypercapnia and hypocapnia were associated with higher mortality than normocapnia.\n",

Extrapolating from adult data, current pediatric resuscitation guidelines recommend avoiding hyperoxia. We investigated the relationship between arterial partial oxygen pressure and survival in patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after cardiac arrest.\n## METHODS AND RESULTS\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet) database between 2003 and 2010 (n=122,521). Patients aged <16 years with documented cardiac arrest preceding PICU admission and arterial blood gas analysis taken within 1 hour of PICU admission were included. The primary outcome measure was death within the PICU. The relationship between postarrest oxygen status and outcome was modeled with logistic regression, with nonlinearities explored via multivariable fractional polynomials. Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, congenital heart disease, out-of-hospital arrest, year, Pediatric Index of Mortality-2 (PIM2) mortality risk, and organ supportive therapies. Of 1875 patients, 735 (39%) died in PICU. Based on the first arterial gas, 207 patients (11%) had hyperoxia (Pa(O)(2) \u2265300 mm Hg) and 448 (24%) had hypoxia (Pa(O)(2) <60 mm Hg). We found a significant nonlinear relationship between Pa(O)(2) and PICU mortality. After covariate adjustment, risk of death increased sharply with increasing hypoxia (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.80-2.21 at Pa(O)(2) of 23 mm Hg). There was also an association with increasing hyperoxia, although not as dramatic as that for hypoxia (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.37 at 600 mm Hg). We observed an increasing mortality risk with advancing age, which was more pronounced in the presence of congenital heart disease.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBoth severe hypoxia and, to a lesser extent, hyperoxia are associated with an increased risk of death after PICU admission after cardiac arrest.\n",

The objective of our study was to analyze post-return of spontaneous circulation factors associated with in-hospital mortality after cardiac arrest in children.\n## METHODS\nA prospective multicenter, multinational, observational study in 48 hospitals from 12 countries was performed. A total of 502 children aged between 1 month and 18 years with in-hospital cardiac arrest were analyzed. The primary endpoint was survival to hospital discharge. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the influence of each post-return of spontaneous circulation factor on mortality.\n## RESULTS\nReturn of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 69.5% of patients; 39.2% survived to hospital discharge and 88.9% of survivors had good neurological outcome. In the univariate analysis, post- return of spontaneous circulation factors related with mortality were pH, base deficit, lactic acid, bicarbonate, FiO2, need for inotropic support, inotropic index, dose of dopamine and dobutamine at 1 hour and at 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation as well as Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and total hospital length of stay. In the multivariate analysis factors associated with mortality at 1 hour after return of spontaneous circulation were PaCO2 < 30 mmHg and >50 mmHg, inotropic index >14 and lactic acid >5 mmol/L. Factors associated with mortality at 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation were PaCO2 > 50 mmHg, inotropic index >14 and FiO2 \u2265 0.80.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nSecondary in-hospital mortality among the initial survivors of CA is high. Hypoventilation, hyperventilation, FiO2 \u2265 0.80, the need for high doses of inotropic support, and high levels of lactic acid were the most important post-return of spontaneous circulation factors associated with in-hospital mortality in children in our population.\n",

Logistic regression was used to determine whether hyperoxemia (PaO2 \u2265 300 torr [39.99 kPa]) in the 12 hours surrounding PICU admission was associated with in-hospital mortality. We reperformed our analysis using a cutoff for hyperoxemia obtained by comparisons of observed versus predicted mortality when encounters were classified by highest PaO2 in 50 torr (6.67 kPa) bins. Results are reported as adjusted odds ratios with 95% CIs. Of 23,719 encounters, 4,093 had a PaO2 recorded in the period -6 to +6 hours after admission.

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVES\nPatients who require venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because of cardiac failure frequently have supranormal blood oxygen tensions (hyperoxia). Recent studies have suggested worse outcomes in patients with hyperoxia after resuscitation from cardiac or respiratory arrests, presumably because of oxidative stress. There are limited data regarding the effect of hyperoxia on outcomes in pediatric patients on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\n## DESIGN\nRetrospective chart review.\n## SETTING\nPediatric cardiothoracic ICU.\n## PATIENTS\nCardiac surgery patients less than 1 year old requiring venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the postoperative period from 2007 to 2013.\n## MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nIn 93 infants (median time on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 5 d), mortality at 30 days post surgery (primary outcome) was 38%. Using a receiver operating characteristic curve, a mean PaO2 of 193 mm Hg in the first 48 hours of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was determined to have good discriminatory ability with regard to 30-day mortality. Univariate analysis identified a mean PaO2 greater than 193 mm Hg (p = 0.001), longer cardiopulmonary bypass times (p = 0.09), longer duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (p < 0.0001), and higher extracorporeal membrane oxygenation pump flows (p = 0.052) as possible risk factors for 30-day mortality. In multivariable analysis controlling for the variables listed above, a mean PaO2 greater than 193 mm Hg remained an independent risk factor for mortality (p = 0.03). In addition, a mean PaO2 greater than 193 mm Hg was associated with the need for renal dialysis (p = 0.02) but not with neurologic injury (p = 0.41) during the hospitalization.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn infants with congenital heart disease who are placed on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation postoperatively, hyperoxia (defined as a mean PaO2 > 193 mm Hg in the first 48 hr of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) was an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality after surgery. Future studies are needed to delineate the causative or associative role of hyperoxia with outcomes, especially in children with baseline cyanosis who may be more susceptible to the effects of oxidative stress.\n",

            "title": "High cumulative oxygen levels are associated with improved survival of children treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest.",
            "abstract": "## AIM\nThe aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) and in-hospital (IH) mortality in children after cardiac arrest (CA) using the conventional cutoff analysis, which was compared with the cumulative analysis, a new method in PaO2 analysis. Additionally, we analyzed this relationship for children with and without mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH; 32-34 \u00b0C).\n## METHODS\nThis observational cohort study included all children (aged >28 days) with CA and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) between 2002 and 2011. The first research question was the association between PaO2 and IH mortality after ROSC. This was analyzed for three hyperoxia cutoff values, and for three time intervals using the cumulative PaO2 determined with the area under the curve (AUC). For the second research question, these analyses were repeated for children with and without MTH.\n## RESULTS\nOf the 200 patients included (median age 2.6 years), 84 (42%) survived to hospital discharge. Fifty-eight children (29%) were treated with MTH. With the cutoff analysis and the AUC analysis we found no relationship between PaO2 and IH mortality. However, analysis of the MTH-group showed a lower IH mortality in children with high cumulative PaO2 levels on two of the three time intervals. Multivariable analysis showed significantly higher odds of survival (0.643 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.424-0.976), 0.554 (95% CI 0.335-0.916)).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCumulative PaO2 analysis showed that the IH mortality is significantly lower in MTH-treated children with high PaO2 levels. The effects of cumulative PaO2 on the outcome need to be studied further, and this will help us to achieve individualized goal-directed therapy.\n",
