Tasks that were completed infrequently by all residents include ensuring that the shoulder roll is available (11%) and ensuring access to head-of-bed (31%) during the preparation phase and applying shoulder roll (10%) and calling for help (23%) during the AE phase. The median time to recognition of AE from onset of hypoventilation was 33 seconds and that for delivery of oxygen and PPV was 60 and 97 seconds, respectively.

Restrictive feeding strategies are of no impact in modifying GERD symptoms or clinically meaningful outcomes.

Proper sedation may reduce stress and avoid complications during procedures such as mechanical ventilation. Midazolam is a short acting benzodiazepine that has been increasingly used in the NICU. However, the effectiveness of intravenous midazolam as a sedative in neonates has not been systematically evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine whether intravenous midazolam infusion is an effective sedative, as evaluated by behavioural and/or physiologic measurements, for critically ill neonates undergoing intensive care, and to assess clinically significant short and long term adverse effects associated with its use.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      Literature search according to the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group search strategy. Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of intravenous midazolam use in neonates were identified by searching the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1985-2002), EMBASE (1980-2002), reference lists of published studies, personal files, and abstracts published in Pediatric Research from 1990-2002.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of intravenous midazolam infusion in infants </= 28 days of age for sedation during mechanical ventilation or radiologic investigations were selected for review. Studies on midazolam use as an anesthetic or an anticonvulsant were excluded. Studies involving neonates and older infants and children were excluded if data for neonates could not be extracted.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Data regarding the primary outcome of level of sedation (as evaluated by behavioural scales or physiologic parameters) were abstracted. Secondary outcomes including intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), death within 28 days of age, adverse effects associated with midazolam (hemodynamic and neurologic), days of ventilation, days of supplemental oxygen use, pneumothorax, length of NICU stay, and long term neurodevelopmental outcome were assessed. When appropriate, meta-analyses were performed using relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), along with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for categorical variables and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous variables.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Three trials were eligible for inclusion in the review. Data on level of sedation from the three trials could not be combined for meta-analysis because of differences in tools used to measure sedation levels. Two studies (Jacqz-Aigrain 1994, Arya 2001) showed a statistically significantly higher level of sedation in the midazolam group compared to the placebo group. The third study (Anand 1999) comparing midazolam to morphine and placebo found no statistically significant difference in sedation level among the three groups, but a statistically significantly higher level of sedation was found in the midazolam group compared with the placebo group during the treatment infusion. However, since the sedation scales used in all three studies have not been validated in preterm infants, the effectiveness of midazolam as a sedative in this population could not be ascertained. In the study by Jacqz-Aigrain et al (Jacqz-Aigrain 1994), blood pressure was statistically significantly lower in the midazolam group than in the placebo group on days one and two, although there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of hypotension requiring albumin or vasoactive drugs between groups. The study by Anand et al (Anand 1999) showed a statistically significant higher incidence of adverse neurologic events (death, grade III-IV IVH, PVL) in the midazolam group compared with the other groups. In addition, meta-analysis of available data from two studies (Jacqz-Aigrain 1994, Anand 1999) showed a statistically significantly longer duration of NICU stay in the midazolam group compared to the placebo group (WMD 5.4 days, 95%CI 0.4, 10.5). Meta-analyses of other secondary outcomes showed no statistically significant differences between the midazolam and placebo groups.\n    \n\n\n          Reviewer's conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There are insufficient data to promote the use of intravenous midazolam infusion as a sedative for neonates undergoing intensive care. This review raises concerns about the safety of midazolam in neonates. Further research on the effectiveness and safety of midazolam in neonates is needed."

Children receiving the combination of F + P had significantly higher biopsy success rates vs. other drug combinations (96.1% vs. 79%; p = 0.014). There was no difference in complication rates regardless of drug combination or biopsy type (transplanted vs. native).

            "abstract": "Mechanical ventilation using low tidal volumes has become universally accepted to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) allows pulmonary gas exchange using very small tidal volume (1-2 mL/kg) with concomitant decreased risk of atelectrauma. However, its use in pediatric critical care varies between only 3% and 30% of all ventilated children. This might be explained by the fact that the beneficial effect of HFOV on patient outcome has not been ascertained. Alternatively, in contrast with present recommendations, one can ask if HFOV has been employed in its most optimal fashion related especially to the indications for and timing of HFOV, as well as to using the best oscillator settings. The first was addressed in one small randomized study showing that early use of HFOV, instead of rescue use, was associated with improved survival. From a physiologic perspective, the oscillator settings could be refined. Lung volume is the main determinant of oxygenation in diffuse alveolar disease, suggesting using an open-lung strategy by recruitment maneuvers, although this is in practice not custom. Using such an approach, the patient can be oscillated on the deflation limb of the pressure-volume (P-V) curve, allowing less pressure required to maintain a certain amount of lung volume. Gas exchange is determined by the frequency and the oscillatory power setting, controlling the magnitude of the membrane displacement. Experimental work as well as preliminary human data have shown that it is possible to achieve the smallest tidal volume with concomitant adequate gas exchange when oscillating at high frequency and high fixed power setting. Future studies are needed to validate these novel approaches and to evaluate their effect on patient outcome."

However, the algorithm differs between the two methods. Cardiometry may be more accurate in patients with a low cardiac output state. Calamandrei et al. found that an analytical method using arterial pulse pressure recording (pressure recording analytical method) shows a high correlation with Doppler echocardiography.

Our aim was to determine if results of respiratory function measurement on the first day of ventilation identified children who would develop prolonged ventilatory dependence (> or = 4 days) and whether such results were a more accurate predictor than readily available clinical data. Thirty three children, median age 2 years (range 0.1-13.6), who were supported by a constant flow ventilator and hence had measurements of compliance of the respiratory system (CRS) and resistance of the respiratory system (RRS) on the first day of ventilatory support, were retrospectively identified. Those who needed prolonged ventilatory support had a lower CRS on day one (p < 0.01) and required at any time during their ventilatory career both a higher maximum inspired oxygen concentration (p < 0.01) and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) (p < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that only a low CRS and high maximum PIP were significantly correlated with prolonged ventilator dependence. A low CRS (<0.4 (ml/cmH2O) kg(-1)) and a high maximum PIP (>27 cmH2O) had similar sensitivities (83%) and specificities (71% and 67% respectively) in predicting prolonged ventilatory dependence. The CRS results, unlike the maximum PIP results, however, were always available on the first day of ventilatory support. We therefore conclude that respiratory function measurements have a role in identifying children who would benefit from strategies to prevent prolonged ventilator dependence."

            "abstract": "'Permissive hypercapnia' is a familiar term in neonatal intensive care, given the widespread adoption of low-tidal-volume ventilation strategies applied with the goal of decreasing respiratory morbidity. Recent evidence suggesting that hypercapnic acidosis may itself have protective effects on the lung and other organs has led to the coining of a new phrase, 'therapeutic hypercapnia', which also encompasses the use of supplemental inspired CO(2).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Experimental evidence suggests that mild-moderate hypercapnia can improve tissue oxygenation and perfusion, which may ameliorate injury to the immature lung and brain. However, hypercapnia may also be associated with adverse outcomes, and the range of PaCO(2) levels that are both safe and effective for specific subsets of neonates has yet to be determined."

            "abstract": "There is variability in critical care outcome of the HSCT recipient. One potential reason may be due to the inconsistent ventilation approaches. To quantitate this variability, we conducted a survey to assess self-reported use of ventilation and adjunctive strategies for the HSCT recipient. Electronic survey, open from June 2012 through January 201, distributed through the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators network electronic mailing list. Ninety-four individual responses were from 36 different institutions. The majority indicated that HSCT recipients requiring critical care were admitted to the general PICU. The vast majority (89%) endorsed routine practice of low-tidal-volume ventilation strategies. More than half stated that pressure-regulated volume control is the starting mode of choice. Eighty-three percent felt their group practiced early initiation of lung protective strategies. Eleven percent encouraged \"early transition\" to HFOV. Inhaled nitric oxide and milrinone were reported at the highest frequencies, but the majority used these empirically. Opinions regarding variables that affect outcomes of the HSCT were diverse. The estimated mortality of HSCT patients with respiratory was highly variable. Strategies for ventilation and oxygenation, use of HFOV, and adjunctive therapies are variable among pediatric intensivists."

            "abstract": "The optimal inhaled oxygen fraction for newborn resuscitation is still not settled. We hypothesized that short-lasting oxygen ventilation after intrauterine asphyxia would not cause arterial or cerebral hyperoxia, and therefore be innocuous. The umbilical cord of fetal sheep was clamped and 10 min later, after delivery, ventilation with air (n = 7) or with 100% oxygen for 3 (n = 6) or 30 min (n = 5), followed by air, was started. Among the 11 lambs given 100% oxygen, oxygen tension (PO2) was 10.7 (1.8-56) kPa [median (range)] in arterial samples taken after 2.5 min of ventilation. In those ventilated with 100% oxygen for 30 min, brain tissue PO2 (PbtO2) increased from less than 0.1 kPa in each lamb to individual maxima of 56 (30-61) kPa, whereas in those given oxygen for just 3 min, PbtO2 peaked at 4.2 (2.9-46) kPa. The maximal PbtO2 in air-ventilated lambs was 2.9 (0.8-5.4) kPa. Heart rate and blood pressure increased equally fast in the three groups. Thus, prolonged ventilation with 100% oxygen caused an increase in PbtO2 of a magnitude previously only reported under hyperbaric conditions. Reducing the time of 100% oxygen ventilation to 3 min did not consistently avert systemic hyperoxia."

All of the TPE procedures performed in a pediatric intensive care unit providing tertiary care during 4 years (2015-2019) were evaluated retrospectively. TPE procedures (635) were performed for 135 patients. Median age was 34 months (10-108). Ninety-seven patients had mechanical ventilation support. Sepsis with multiple organ failure was the most frequent indication and accounted for 44.4% (n = 60) of the indications followed by hematological and neurological diseases (19.2% and 9.6% respectively). TPE was performed alone in 469 cases (73.9%), in combination with continuous renal replacement therapy in 154 cases (24.2%), and additional to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 12 cases (1.9%). Hematological disease and sepsis subgroups had the highest intubation rate, mechanical ventilation period, PRISM score, organ failure count, and mortality. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was the most frequently used replacement fluid in 90.4% of the procedures. The most frequent anticoagulant used in TPE was acid citrate dextrose solution (79.3%). Procedural complications were detected in 104 cases (16.3%) and occurred during TPE sessions. Overall survival rate was 78.5%. We found that the non-survivor group had significantly higher rates of organ failures (P = 0.0001), higher PRISM scores on admission (P = 0.0001), and higher rates of invasive ventilation support needed (P = 0.012). TPE is a treatment method which can be safely provided in healthcare facilities with necessary medical and technical requirements.

Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC) were determined for all study timepoints and outcome variables.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Ninety-two patients were analyzed; their median age was 0.65 (range, 3 days to 17.9 years), and 17 (18%) had single-ventricle anatomy. The VVR measurements outperformed vasoactive-inotrope scores in isolation at all timepoints, with higher AUC values for all outcomes. Of the three timepoints assessed, the 48-hour VVR score most consistently predicted poor outcome, especially with regard to prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation (AUC 0.980) and prolonged intensive care unit stay (AUC 0.919).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In a heterogeneous population of children undergoing cardiac surgery, the 48-hour VVR score was a very strong predictor of outcomes, and outperformed the more traditional vasoactive-inotrope score. The VVR score, therefore, represents a novel and potentially powerful means of predicting clinical outcomes relatively early in the hospital course of these patients."

A respiratory dysfunction associated with transfusion was considered new if it appeared after the first RBC transfusion in PICU. A progressive respiratory dysfunction associated with transfusion was diagnosed if the respiratory dysfunction was present before the transfusion and the PaO2/FIO2 or the SpO2/FIO2 ratio dropped by at least 20% thereafter. Among 842 children admitted into the PICU, 136 received at least one RBC transfusion and were analyzed. Fifty-eight cases of respiratory dysfunction associated with transfusion (43% of transfused patients) were detected, including nine new respiratory dysfunction associated with transfusion (7%) and 49 progressive respiratory dysfunction associated with transfusion (36%). Higher severity of illness, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome prior to transfusion, and volume (mL/kg) of RBC transfusion were independently associated with respiratory dysfunction associated with transfusion. A dose-response relationship was observed between transfusion volume (mL/kg) and the prevalence of respiratory dysfunction associated with transfusion. Patients with respiratory dysfunction associated with transfusion had more progressive multiple organ dysfunction and less ventilation-free and PICU-free days at day 28.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Development of respiratory dysfunction associated with transfusion is frequent in PICU and occurs mainly in patients with prior respiratory dysfunction, who would not be identified using current definitions for transfusion-associated complications.

Evaluation of feasibility included also the total application time of respiratory treatment, the number of continuous positive airway pressure discontinuations/first 24 hrs. Interface-related complications included air leaks, cutaneous pressure sores, eye irritation, inhalation, and gastric distension. The 20 patients and control subjects had similar matching characteristics. Continuous positive airway pressure delivered by a helmet compared with a facial mask reduced continuous positive airway pressure trial failure rate (p = .02), increased application time (p = .001) with less discontinuations (p = .001), and was not associated with an increased rate of major adverse events, resulting in decreased air leaks (p = .04) and pressure sores (p = .002).

            "abstract": "Hybrid intratracheal pulmonary ventilation (h-ITPV) is a continuous flow ventilatory technique that uses a \"reverse thruster\" catheter to redirect the flow of gas away from the carina. We report here the use of h-ITPV in a pediatric patient with acute sickle cell chest syndrome who required venoarterial ECMO support because of refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure. Her ECMO course was complicated by air leaks, coagulopathy, cardiac tamponade, and necrotizing tracheobronchitis. She could be weaned from ECMO only by maintaining high pressure conventional ventilatory support. To prevent ventilator induced barotrauma, we initiated h-ITPV and weaned her from ECMO bypass. After 12 days of h-ITPV, with tidal volumes of 2-3 ml/kg at carinal peak inspiratory pressures of 25-30 cm H2O, the air leaks ceased and h-ITPV was discontinued. Dead space ventilation fraction (VD/VT) as low as 0.29 was achieved with this technique. Post-h-ITPV bronchoscopy displayed a dramatic resolution of the necrotizing tracheobronchitis. The patient survived and was discharged from the hospital. We conclude that the use of hybrid ITPV may facilitate weaning from ECMO to low pressure conventional ventilation and prevent the development of pulmonary barotrauma."

Eight patients with life-threatening multisystem organ failure, from diverse causes, were treated; the survival rate was 50%. All survivors were neurologically intact at the time of discharge. The success of ECMO, coupled with improvements in technique, apparatus, and expertise, has allowed application of ECMO as an invasive extension of intensive care to diverse patient groups.

Based on pathophysiological derangements observed in COVID-19 patients, a rationale emerges for sequential extracorporeal therapies designed to remove inflammatory mediators and support different organ systems. In the absence of vaccines or direct therapy for COVID-19, extracorporeal therapies could represent an option to prevent organ failure and improve survival.

            "abstract": "This review offers a critical-care perspective on the pathophysiology, monitoring, and management of acute heart failure syndromes in children. An in-depth understanding of the cardiovascular physiological disturbances in this population of patients is essential to correctly interpret clinical signs, symptoms and monitoring data, and to implement appropriate therapies. In this regard, the myocardial force-velocity relationship, the Frank-Starling mechanism, and pressure-volume loops are discussed. A variety of monitoring modalities are used to provide insight into the haemodynamic state, clinical trajectory, and response to treatment. Critical-care treatment of acute heart failure is based on the fundamental principles of optimising the delivery of oxygen and minimising metabolic demands. The former may be achieved by optimising systemic arterial oxygen content and the variables that determine cardiac output: heart rate and rhythm, preload, afterload, and contractility. Metabolic demands may be decreased by a number of ways including positive pressure ventilation, temperature control, and sedation. Mechanical circulatory support should be considered for refractory cases. In the near future, monitoring modalities may be improved by the capture and analysis of complex clinical data such as pressure waveforms and heart rate variability. Using predictive modelling and streaming analytics, these data may then be used to develop automated, real-time clinical decision support tools. Given the barriers to conducting multi-centre trials in this population of patients, the thoughtful analysis of data from multi-centre clinical registries and administrative databases will also likely have an impact on clinical practice."

Should it be used in SCNs, and, if so, what is required in order to undertake nCPAP safely? There is strong evidence to support the use of nCPAP in the treatment of babies with respiratory distress.

Primary outcome measure was survival to PICU discharge.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Mean OSI of the cohort increased until the day of steroid commencement then improved thereafter. 59% of patients demonstrated a response to steroids. Baseline characteristics were similar between responders and non-responders. Survival to PICU discharge was significantly higher in 'responders' (74% vs 41% OR 4.14(1.57-10.87) p = 0.004). On multivariable analysis using likely confounders, response to steroid was an independent predictor of survival to PICU discharge (p = 0.002). Non-responders died earlier after steroid administration than responders (p = 0.003).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      An improvement in OSI was observed in 60% of patients following initiation of low dose methylprednisolone therapy in this cohort of patients with PARDS. Baseline characteristics fail to demonstrate a difference between responders and non-responders. A 20% improvement in OSI after commencement of methylprednisolone was independently predictive of survival, Prospective trials are needed to establish if there is a benefit from this therapy."

            "abstract": "The French Society of Intensive Care (SRLF) requested medical experts to publish recommendations on the management of stroke in the ICU for adult and pediatric patients. The following article describes the underlying evidence used by the experts to elaborate recommendations for general supportive treatment. Such treatment is fundamental for victims of acute stroke to avoid neurological worsening. Oxygen delivery in a normoxic patient is useless. However, if saturation is below 92 %, oxygen supplementation is needed. Hyper- and hypoglycemia worsen the neurological prognosis. As no glycemic target is known, administration of insulin is required for glucose levels higher that 10 mmol/l. Body temperature above 37.5° is associated with poorer outcome. In the acute phase of stroke, high blood pressure should not be lowered except in life-threatening situations, and if so the lowering should be done cautiously. The current consensus is to lower blood pressure if the systolic pressure is above 220 mmHg or if the diastolic pressure is above 120 mmHg for ischemic stroke. For hemorrhagic stroke and after thrombolysis, treatment is needed if systolic pressure rises above 180 mmHg and if diastolic pressure is above 105 mmHg. Small doses of heparin decrease the risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism without increasing cerebral bleeding. There is no consensus on the treatment of epileptic crises after stroke and no dedicated treatment. Further studies are needed to define adequate blood pressure and glycemic target values in order to limit secondary worsening after an acute stroke as well as the appropriate modalities for the treatment of epilepsy."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nIschemia depletes antioxidant reserves and impairs mitochondrial electron transport. Oxygen within blood reperfusing ischemic tissue can form free radicals, worsen oxidative stress, and exacerbate tissue injury (reperfusion injury). One strategy for limiting reperfusion injury is to limit delivery of \"luxuriant\" oxygen during or after reperfusion. Resuscitation guidelines for children with cardiac arrest recommend early weaning of supplemental oxygen as tolerated. There are currently no studies demonstrating the frequency and outcomes of hyperoxia and hypoxia after pediatric cardiac arrest.\n## OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the frequency and outcomes of hyperoxia and hypoxia in patients following resuscitation from pediatric cardiac arrest admitted to a tertiary care center.\n## DESIGN AND METHODS\nThis is a retrospective observational cohort study. Charts of children resuscitated from cardiac arrest and admitted to our hospital from 2004 to 2008 were reviewed. Partial pressures of oxygen (PaO2) obtained within the first 24 hours following return of spontaneous circulation and mortality at 6 months was recorded. Children who did not survive the initial 48 hours, patients having undergone extracorporeal oxygenation or had congenital heart disease, and those in whom arterial blood gases were not obtained were excluded.\n## RESULTS\nSeventy-four patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 38 (51%) had at least one arterial blood gases with a PaO2 > 300 mm Hg and 10 (14%) had a PaO2 < 60 mm Hg in the first 24 hours. Neither hyperoxia nor hypoxia on initial arterial blood gases (p = 0.912 and p = 0.384) nor any arterial blood gases within the first 24 hours after cardiac arrest (p = 0.325 and p = 0.553) was associated with 6-month mortality.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nHyperoxia occurs commonly within the first 24 hours of management in children resuscitated from cardiac arrest.\n"

It has also become a target for neuroprotection in acute intensive care. Despite its well-known therapeutic effects, therapeutic hypothermia has recently been re-evaluated for its potential use in emergency and critical care medicine. Hypothermia is an undesirable physiological condition that can increase oxidative stress and decrease anti-oxidative potency. However, many studies have shown that under ischemia/reperfusion conditions, therapeutic hypothermia actually suppresses enhanced oxidative stress and maintains or increases anti-oxidative potency.

The pharmacologic principles underlying current recommendations for intervention in pediatric cardiac arrest have been reviewed. Current research efforts, points of controversy, and accepted practices that may not be most efficacious have been described. Epinephrine remains the most effective resuscitation adjunct. High-dose epinephrine is tolerated better in children than in adults, but its efficacy has not received full analysis. The preponderance of data continues to point toward the ineffectiveness and possible deleterious effects of overzealous sodium bicarbonate use. Calcium chloride is useful in the treatment of ionized hypocalcemia but may harm cells that have experienced asphyxial damage. Atropine is an effective agent for alleviating bradycardia induced by increased vagal tone, but because most bradycardia in children is caused by hypoxia, improved oxygenation is the intervention of choice. Adenosine is an effective and generally well-tolerated agent for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia. Lidocaine is the drug of choice for ventricular dysrhythmias, and bretylium, still relatively unexplored, is in reserve. Many pediatricians use dopamine for shock in the postresuscitative period, but epinephrine is superior. Most animal research on cardiac arrest is based on models with ventricular fibrillation that probably are not reflective of cardiac arrest situations most often seen in pediatrics."

Because of the risk for accumulation of methemoglobin (MetHb) and cyanmethemoglobin (cyan-MetHb) during prolonged continuous infusion of NTG and SNP, it was decided to (1) quantify ICU use, (2) measure % MetHb at 12-hour intervals, and (3) look indirectly for the accumulation of cyan-MetHb by comparing simultaneous pulse oximetry (SpO2) (Nellcor N-100 [Nellcor, Haywood, CO]) and CO-oximetry (SaO2) (Corning 270 [Corning, Medfield, MA]).

However, their performances were unclear in Chinese patients and there were also no reports based on large sample sizes in China. This study aims to evaluate the performances of three existing severity assessment scores in predicting PICU mortality and to identify important determinants. Methods: This prospective observational cohort study was carried out in eight multidisciplinary, tertiary-care PICUs of teaching hospitals in China. All eligible patients admitted to the PICUs between Aug 1, 2016, and Jul 31, 2017, were consecutively enrolled, among whom 3,957 were included for analysis. We calculated PCIS, PRISM IV, and PELOD-2 scores based on patient data collected in the first 24 h after PICU admission. The in-hospital mortality was defined as all-cause death within 3 months after admission. The discrimination of mortality was assessed using the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) and calibrated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Results: A total of 4,770 eligible patients were recruited (median age 18.2 months, overall mortality rate 4.7%, median length of PICU stay 6 days), and 3,957 participants were included in the analysis. The AUC (95% confidence intervals, CI) were 0.74 (0.71-0.78), 0.76 (0.73-0.80), and 0.80 (0.77-0.83) for PCIS, PRISM IV, and PELOD-2, respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test gave a chi-square of 3.16 for PCIS, 2.16 for PRISM IV and 4.81 for PELOD-2 (p ≥ 0.19). Cox regression identified five predictors from the items of scores better associated with higher death risk, with a C-index of 0.83 (95%CI 0.79-0.86), including higher platelet (HR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.59-2.16), invasive ventilation (HR = 1.40, 1.26-1.55), pupillary light reflex (HR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.22-1.42) scores, lower pH (HR 0.89, 0.84-0.94), and extreme PaO2 (HR 2.60, 95% CI 1.61-4.19 for the 1st quantile vs. 4th quantile) scores.

There is lack of evidence regarding effective treatment for bronchiolitis other than supportive care. Abnormalities of surfactant quantity or quality (or both) have been observed in severe cases of bronchiolitis. Exogenous surfactant administration appears to favourably change the haemodynamics of the lungs and may be a potentially promising therapy for severe bronchiolitis. This is an update of a review published in Issue 9, 2012. We did not identify any new studies for inclusion, and our conclusions remain unchanged.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the efficacy of exogenous surfactant administration (i.e. intratracheal administration of surfactant of any type (whether animal-derived or synthetic), at any dose and at any time after start of ventilation) compared to placebo, no intervention or standard care in reducing mortality and the duration of ventilation in infants and children with bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Studies (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 5) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1948 to June week 3, 2015); EMBASE (1974 to June 2015); CINAHL (1982 to June 2015); LILACS (1985 to June 2015); and Web of Science (1985 to June 2015).\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We considered prospective, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating the effect of exogenous surfactant in infants and children with bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors selected studies independently. We extracted the data using a predefined proforma, independently analysed the data, and performed meta-analyses.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included three small RCTs enrolling 79 participants. Two trials did not use a placebo in the control arms and the third trial used air placebo. Two included studies reported no mortality. We judged all three of the included studies to be at low risk or unclear risk across all risk of bias categories; we did not judge any of the studies to be at high risk of bias in any category. Our pooled analysis of the three trials revealed that duration of mechanical ventilation was not significantly different between the groups (mean difference (MD) -63.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) -130.43 to 4.35 hours) but duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was less in the surfactant group compared to the control group: MD -3.31, 95% CI -6.38 to -0.25 days. After excluding one trial which produced significant heterogeneity, the duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of ICU stay were significantly lower in the surfactant group compared to the control group: MD -28.99, 95% CI -40.10 to -17.87 hours; and MD -1.81, 95% CI -2.42 to -1.19 days, respectively. Use of surfactant had favourable effects on oxygenation and CO2 elimination. No adverse effects and no complications were observed in any of the three included studies.

            "abstract": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides complete or partial support of the heart and lungs. Ever since its inception in the 1960s, it has been used across all age groups in the management of refractory respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. While it has gained widespread acceptance in the neonatal and pediatric physician community, ECMO remains a controversial therapy for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in adults. Its popularity was revived during the swine flu (H1N1) pandemic and advancements in technology have contributed to its increasing usage. ARDS continues to be a potentially devastating condition with significant mortality rates. Despite gaining more insights into this entity over the years, mechanical ventilation remains the only life-saving, yet potentially harmful intervention available for ARDS. ECMO shows promise in this regard by offering less dependence on mechanical ventilation, thereby potentially reducing ventilator-induced injury. However, the lack of rigorous clinical data has prevented ECMO from becoming the standard of care in the management of ARDS. Therefore, the results of two large ongoing randomized trials, which will hopefully throw more light on the role of ECMO in the management of this disease entity, are keenly awaited. In this article we will provide a basic overview of the development of ECMO, the types of ECMO, the pathogenesis of ARDS, different ventilation strategies for ARDS, the role of ECMO in ARDS and the role of ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation."

Selenium was given only as part of enteral diets. Age, malnutrition, red cell glutathione peroxidase-1 activity, serum C-reactive protein, Pediatric Index of Mortality 2, and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction scores were analyzed as covariates.

Some patients decompensate and require Veno-Arterial extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a palliating manoeuvre for recovery of cardiopulmonary function. The molecular mechanisms driving progression from MODS to cardiopulmonary collapse remain incompletely understood, and no biomarkers have been defined to identify those MODS patients at highest risk for progression to requiring ECMO support.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Whole blood RNA-seq profiling was performed for 23 MODS patients at three time points during their ICU stay (at diagnosis of MODS, 72 hours after, and 8 days later), as well as four healthy controls undergoing routine sedation. Of the 23 MODS patients, six required ECMO support (ECMO patients). The predictive power of conventional demographic and clinical features was quantified for differentiating the MODS and ECMO patients. We then compared the performance of markers derived from transcriptomic profiling including [1] transcriptomically imputed leukocyte subtype distribution, [2] relevant published gene signatures and [3] a novel differential gene expression signature computed from our data set. The predictive power of our novel gene expression signature was then validated using independently published datasets.\n    \n\n\n          Finding:\n        \n      \n      None of the five demographic characteristics and 14 clinical features, including The Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) score, could predict deterioration of MODS to ECMO at baseline. From previously published sepsis signatures, only the signatures positively associated with patient's mortality could differentiate ECMO patients from MODS patients, when applied to our transcriptomic dataset (P-value ranges from 0.01 to 0.04, Student's test). Deconvolution of bulk RNA-Seq samples suggested that lower neutrophil counts were associated with increased risk of progression from MODS to ECMO (P-value = 0.03, logistic regression, OR=2.82 [95% CI 0.63 - 12.45]). A total of 30 genes were differentially expressed between ECMO and MODS patients at baseline (log2 fold change ≥ 1 or ≤ -1 with false discovery rate ≤ 0.01). These genes are involved in protein maintenance and epigenetic-related processes. Further univariate analysis of these 30 genes suggested a signature of seven DE genes associated with ECMO (OR > 3.0, P-value ≤ 0.05, logistic regression). Notably, this contains a set of histone marker genes, including H1F0, HIST2H3C, HIST1H2AI, HIST1H4, HIST1H2BL and HIST1H1B, that were highly expressed in ECMO. A risk score derived from expression of these genes differentiated ECMO and MODS patients in our dataset (AUC = 0.91, 95% CI 0.79-1.00, P-value = 7e-04, logistic regression) as well as validation dataset (AUC= 0.73, 95% CI 0.53-0.93, P-value = 2e-02, logistic regression).\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      This study demonstrates that transcriptomic features can serve as indicators of severity that could be superior to traditional methods of ascertaining acuity in MODS patients.

From June 1995 to June 1997 36 critically ill oliguric or anuric infants and children underwent continuous arterio-venous (N = 17) or veno-venous (N = 15) renal support. In addition, four neonates were treated with continuous ultrafiltration (CUF) during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) because of severe diuretic-resistant hypervolemia. Their mean age was 9.8 +/- 1.5 days, their mean body weight 3.0 +/- 0.1 kg. The membrane surface area of the hemofilters ranged from 0.015 m2 to 0.2 m2 and the priming volume from 3.7 to 15 ml. For pump-driven hemofiltration a roller pump with pressure alarms, an air trap, an air bubble detector, and small blood lines was used. Fluid balance was controlled by a microprocessor controlled unit. The ultrafiltrate substitution fluid was based on bicarbonate in the majority of the patients and was partially or totally replaced according to the clinical situation. The mean duration of renal support was 97 +/- 20 hours, ranging from 14 to 720 hours. During arterio-venous and veno-venous hemofiltration the mean blood flow rates were 7.0 +/- 1.2 ml/min and 23.1 +/- 2.4 ml/min (P < 0.01), respectively, and the mean ultrafiltration rates 3.3 +/- 0.4 and 9.5 +/- 1.9 ml/min/m2 (P < 0.01), respectively. During continuous hemodiafiltration urea clearances increased by 300%. Overall survival rate was 66%. CRRT related complications included local bleeding at the catheter entrance site, partial thrombosis of the inferior or superior caval veins and transient ischemia due to femoral artery catheters. Continuous hemofiltration either driven in the arterio-venous or veno-venous mode is a very effective method of renal support for critically ill neonates to control fluid balance and metabolic derangement. Urea clearance can be improved by adding some dialysate fluid in a countercurrent direction to blood flow."

Patients were excluded if doses exceeded 20 mcg/kg, or under the following circumstances: orders limiting resuscitation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, active chest compressions, simultaneous administration of other blood pressure-altering interventions or documented normotension prior to epinephrine. The primary outcome was change in systolic blood pressure within 5 min of epinephrine.

Thirty-nine (27%) patients were classified as non-responders. Compared to responders, non-responders had higher rates of cardiac arrest or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation within 6 h (26% vs 10%; relative risk, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.21-5.97; P = 0.03), and had higher in-hospital mortality (51% vs 21%; relative risk, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.51-3.96; P < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In the majority of pre-arrest pediatric patients, bolus dilute epinephrine resulted in an increase in systolic blood pressure, and lack of blood pressure response was associated with poor outcomes.

High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is emerging as an alternative to CPAP. Despite encouraging results of several clinical and physiological studies, HFNC use remains controversial and its indications heterogeneous. To better define the place of HFNC in severe bronchiolitis respiratory support, we investigated the different ventilation assistance techniques used for severe bronchiolitis over 3 days at the peak of a bronchiolitis epidemic in December 2015. We conducted an observational cross-sectional study in 27 French university hospital PICUs. Fifty-nine patients were included. The results show that HFNC already accounts for nearly half of the respiratory support techniques used for severe bronchiolitis in French PICUs with no significant difference between the CPAP group and the HFNC group of patients."

System readiness, need for additional blood products, and exposure to new surfaces are important considerations, particularly when used for resuscitation. We reviewed our experience with a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) system modified to provide extended circulatory support system after surgery in patients considered at high risk. When not used in the operating room, the system was recirculated for 24 hours. Before being discarded, blood samples were obtained for activated clotting time, arterial blood gas, and blood cultures from 10 circuits. Between January 2004, and December 2005, 44 patients underwent cardiac repair using this CPB system. ECMO support was initiated in the operating room in 8 patients, and six circuits were used after patient arrival in the intensive care unit. Blood sampling after 24 hours on standby circuits revealed acceptable values for pH, Pao2, hematocrit, ionized calcium, potassium level, and ACT. All blood cultures were negative at 5 days. Survival for patients who received a circuit on standby was 64%.This modified cardiopulmonary circuit can be transformed into a simple, safe, and effective ECMO support system. Deployment of a CPB circuit previously used for cardiac repair has many advantages and maximizes utilization of resources."

Exclusion criteria were intubation prior to admission, age >12 months, and the presence of a tracheostomy.\n    \n\n\n          Patients:\n        \n      \n      A total of 113 patients with viral bronchiolitis met the inclusion criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Academic free standing Children's Hospital in the Midwest.\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      Retrospective chart review.\n    \n\n\n          Measurements and main results:\n        \n      \n      The data were analyzed by comparing those patients who responded to high-flow nasal cannula (n = 92) with those who were nonresponders to high-flow nasal cannula and required intubation (n = 21). No differences were noted between the groups for age, sex, or ethnicity. Mean weight and weight-for-corrected-age percentiles were significantly lower for patients who failed high-flow nasal cannula (p = .016 and .031, respectively), but weight-for-corrected-age percentile was not significant in logistic regression controlling for other variables. Respiratory rate prior to the initiation of high-flow nasal cannula also correlated strongly with respiratory deterioration (p < .001). The PCO2 was significantly higher for both before (p < .001) and after (p < .001) initiation of therapy in the nonresponder group. Pediatric Risk of Mortality III scores for the patients who failed high-flow nasal cannula were significantly higher (p < .001) than those of patients who tolerated this therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      History of prematurity and the patient's age did not increase a patient's risk of failure. Nonresponders to high-flow nasal cannula therapy were on the onset, more hypercarbic, were less tachypnic prior to the start of high-flow nasal cannula, and had no change in their respiratory rate after the initiation of high-flow nasal cannula therapy. Nonresponders had higher pediatric risk of mortality scores in the first 24 hrs."

We explored these definitions for children. DESIGN Retrospective cohort SETTING Pediatric, cardiac, or neonatal intensive care units (ICUs) in 6 US hospitals PATIENTS Patients ≤18 years old ventilated for ≥1 day METHODS We identified patients with pediatric VAC based on previously proposed criteria. We applied adult temperature, white blood cell count, antibiotic, and culture criteria for IVAC and PVAP to these patients. We matched pediatric VAC patients with controls and evaluated associations with adverse outcomes using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS In total, 233 pediatric VACs (12,167 ventilation episodes) were identified. In the cardiac ICU (CICU), 62.5% of VACs met adult IVAC criteria; in the pediatric ICU (PICU), 54.2% of VACs met adult IVAC criteria; and in the neonatal ICU (NICU), 20.2% of VACs met adult IVAC criteria. Most patients had abnormal white blood cell counts and temperatures; we therefore recommend simplifying surveillance by focusing on \"pediatric VAC with antimicrobial use\" (pediatric AVAC). Pediatric AVAC with a positive respiratory diagnostic test (\"pediatric PVAP\") occurred in 8.9% of VACs in the CICU, 13.3% of VACs in the PICU, and 4.3% of VACs in the NICU. Hospital mortality was increased, and hospital and ICU length of stay and duration of ventilation were prolonged among all pediatric VAE subsets compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS We propose pediatric AVAC for surveillance related to antimicrobial use, with pediatric PVAP as a subset of AVAC. Studies on generalizability and responsiveness of these metrics to quality improvement initiatives are needed, as are studies to determine whether lower pediatric VAE rates are associated with improvements in other outcomes.

Neither initial PaO2/FO2 nor oxygenation index at time of meeting acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria discriminated mortality. However, 24 hours after, both PaO2/FIO2 and oxygenation index discriminated mortality (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.68 [0.59-0.77] and 0.66 [0.57-0.75]; p < 0.001).

This study also evaluates the ability of the Pediatric Risk Estimate Score for Children Using Extracorporeal Respiratory Support (Ped-RESCUERS) to discriminate mortality risk in the same population, and whether Ped-RESCUERS' discrimination of mortality is improved by additional clinical and laboratory measures of renal, hepatic, neurologic, and hematologic dysfunction. A multi-institutional retrospective cohort study was conducted on children aged 29 days to 17 years with respiratory failure requiring respiratory ECMO support. Discrimination of mortality was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC); model calibration was measured by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test and Brier score. Admission PRISM-III, PIM-2, and PELOD were found to have poor ability to discriminate mortality with an AUC of 0.56 [0.46-0.66], 0.53 [0.43-0.62], and 0.57 [0.47-0.67], respectively. Alternatively, Ped-RESCUERS performed better with an AUC of 0.68 [0.59-0.77]. Higher alanine aminotransferase, ratio of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen the fraction of inspired oxygen, and lactic acidosis were independently associated with mortality and, when added to Ped-RESCUERS, resulted in an AUC of 0.75 [0.66-0.82]. Admission PRISM-III, PIM-2, and PELOD should not be used for pre-ECMO risk adjustment because they do not discriminate death. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation population-derived scores should be used to risk adjust ECMO populations as opposed to general PICU population-derived scores."

            "abstract": "In the era of lung-protective ventilation strategies, high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) has attracted renewed interest and its use has dramatically increased in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units. HFOV is able to reduce ventilator-induced lung injury by limiting the incidence of volutrauma, atelectrauma, barotrauma and biotrauma. During HFOV, adequate oxygenation and ventilation is achieved by using low tidal volumes and small pressure swings at supraphysiologic frequencies. Unlike other high-frequency ventilation modes, HFOV has an active expiration phase. HFOV constitutes a safe and successful ventilation mode for managing pediatric patients with respiratory insufficiency refractory to optimized conventional mechanical ventilation and provides better results when initiated early. However, the elective use of HFOV requires further studies to identify its benefits over conventional modes of mechanical ventilation and to support its routine use as a first line therapy. In the present article, the Respiratory Working Group of the Spanish Society Pediatric Critical Care reviews the main issues in the pediatric application of HFOV. In addition, a general practical protocol and specific management strategies, as well as the monitoring, patient care and other special features of the use of HFOV in the pediatric setting, are discussed."

The objective of this study was to assess the usefulness of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for estimating central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) using both cerebral and renal measurements, explore its relation with cardiac output measurements and check its ability to detect low cardiac output. A prospective observational pilot study was conducted in patients weighing <10 kg undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Spectroscopy probes were placed on the forehead and renal area, and serial cardiac output measurements were obtained by femoral transpulmonary thermodilution over the first 24 h after surgery. In the 15 patients studied, ScvO2 was correlated with cerebral (r = 0.58), renal (r = 0.60) and combined (r = 0.71) measurements. Likewise, the systolic index was correlated with the NIRS signals: cerebral (r = 0.60), renal (r = 0.50) and combined (r = 0.66). Statistically significant differences were found in the NIRS measures registered in the 29 low cardiac output events detected by thermodilution: cerebral: 62 % (59-65) versus 69 % (63-76); renal: 83 % (70-89) versus 89 % (83-95); and combined 64 % (60-69) versus 72 % (67-76).

This plateau could be predicted from the lowest initial point by adding 30 mm Hg. 2) If the lowest initial point was 35 mm Hg or less, it was expected that the final tcPO2 level would be lower than the actual PaO2. 3) No correlation was seen between the lowest initial point of the tcPO2 curve and the time until the initial plateau was reached. In 75% of the cases the plateau was reached within 20 minutes. 4) A slight positive correlation was found between arterial blood pressure and lowest initial point. The difference between the means of the lowest initial point for a group with blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg and another group with blood pressure greater than 120 mm Hg was highly significant. 5) Transcutaneous PO2 measurements were more likely to represent the arterial PO2 level if blood pressure was greater than 120 mm Hg than if it was less than or equal to 90 mm Hg. 6) The lower the initial tcPO2 level, the more likely it was that the arterial level was higher than the tcPO2 level (see also point 2). 7) The differences between PaO2 and tcPO2 were independent of the arterial PO2 level. 8) The overall correlation between PaO2 and tcPO2 in this material was 0.91; the slope was 0.90 and the intercept -8 mm Hg. The correlation coefficient within each individual patient was higher. 9) The correlation coefficient between PaO2 and tcPO2 for those patients in whom PaO2 was 60 mm Hg or less was comparatively low. This may be explained by the bad condition of these patients followed by a reduced blood flow. 10) An initial drop in tcPO2 to zero level indicates a reduced peripheral circulation, but this must be suspected when the initial drop is below 35 mm Hg."

We reviewed the clinical records for 486 full-term infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis with at least one virus detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirate. In 431 (88.7%) patients one virus was detected and in 55 (11.3%) infants more than one virus was found. No differences were observed in the length of hospitalization, clinical severity score, O2 supplementation or admission to the intensive care unit. Single virus was associated with higher serum C-reactive protein (C-RP) than infants with multiple viruses and higher blood neutrophil counts. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected virus. RSV alone was associated with higher C-RP (P = 0.007), compared to RSV coinfection. Infants with human rhinovirus (hRV) alone had higher white blood cell counts, higher blood neutrophils, and higher serum C-RP levels than hRV co-infection (P = 0.029, P = 0.008, P = 0.008). RSV + hRV, the most frequent co-infection, was associated with lower neutrophil count and lower C-RP levels (P = 0.008, P = 0.016) and less fever (P = 0.012), when comparing RSV versus hRV versus RSV + hRV. No differences were found in the frequency of recurrent wheezing between single versus multiple viruses after bronchiolitis.

The patients were randomized into two groups according to the method of oxygen delivery: a diffuser mask group and an HFNC group.There were seven failures in the mask group and none in the HFNC group. The survival probability differed significantly between the two treatment methods (p = 0.009).Time to weaning off oxygen therapy was 56 h in the HFNC group and 96 h in the mask group (p < 0.001).Conclusion: HFNC use decreased the treatment failure rate and the duration of both oxygen therapy and ICU treatment compared to the diffuser mask, which implies that an HFNC should be the first choice for treating patients admitted to the ICU with severe bronchiolitis. What is known: • A high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) does not significantly reduce the time on oxygen compared to standard therapy in children with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. Observational studies show that, since the introduction of HFNC, fewer children with bronchiolitis need intubation. For children with moderate to severe bronchiolitis there is no proof of its benefit.

Predictive power was assessed using the receivor operating characteristic (ROC) analysis on the data collected at these times.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the weaning phase of ECLS, the pHi was significantly lower in children who died (pHi = 7.21; 95% confidence intervals, 7.14 to 7.28) than in those who survived (pHi = 7.38; 95% confidence intervals, 7.28 to 7.47). The DCO2 was significantly higher in children who died (23.6 mm Hg; 95% confidence intervals, 14.3 to 33.1) compared with survivors (4.7 mm Hg; 95% confidence intervals, -0.78 to 10.1). The area under the ROC curve was 0.95 for DCO2 (and 0.88 for pHi). pHi and DCO2 predicted survival better than base deficit (area under ROC curve, 0.82), blood lactate level (0.29), arterial pH (0.65), heart rate (0.62), and mean arterial pressure (0.74).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      DCO2 is a clinically meaningful measurement in children receiving ECLS. A high DCO2 was a good predictor of death in this series. Gastric tonometry may provide a useful measure of the adequacy of regional perfusion and oxygenation in this group of patients."

Distances ranged from 1700 to 10280 nautical miles with transport times from 04:10 hours to 21:55 hours. For 3 patients, a dedicated patient transport compartment (PTC) in the aircraft cabin was used. All patients were ventilator-dependent for a minimum of 11 days before transport (48 days median, 113 days maximum).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One patient went into cardiac arrest during the flight and died.

            "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess whether reversing the veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation blood flow (thereby creating a controlled arterio-venous shunt) can be used to wean children off extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The standard practice for weaning patients off VA extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is to gradually reduce the blood flows delivered through the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation pump to a minimum level followed by either insertion of an \"arterio-venous bridge\" and clamping of the blood flow to the patient or direct decannulation. \"Pump controlled retrograde flow trial off\" is a technique where the revolutions in the centrifugal pump are reduced to the point where the patient will drive the blood retrograde through the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit, effectively turning the circuit into a controlled arterio-venous shunt. The revolutions per minute control the amount of shunt flow. This eliminates any cardiorespiratory support the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit may provide to the patient.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      Feasibility study.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Pediatric intensive care.\n    \n\n\n          Patients:\n        \n      \n      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-dependent pediatric patients, who were ready for weaning, and possible separation from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation entered the trial.\n    \n\n\n          Intervention:\n        \n      \n      Pump controlled retrograde flow trial off.\n    \n\n\n          Measurement and main results:\n        \n      \n      During 2016, pump controlled retrograde flow trial off was used in 17 patients, for a total of 23 episodes. One episode was unsuccessful in a patient with a body weight of 2.2 kg, where cardiac output was insufficient to provide blood flow to both body and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit, though from 2.8 kg body weight upward, the technique was tolerated. The duration of pump controlled retrograde flow trial off was 15 minutes to 2.5 hours. Five cases led to a continuation of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation run, as they were not ready to be decannulated. Fifteen patients were decannulated after the pump controlled retrograde flow trial off. No patient needed to be recommenced on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after decannulation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Pump controlled retrograde flow trial off is an easy to use and easily reversible technique to assess patient readiness for separation from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Given pump controlled retrograde flow trial off can easily be stopped and-in our experience-is not associated with complications, it lowers the threshold to attempt coming off extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and facilitates accurate assessment of whether a patient will need further ongoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support."

            "abstract": "There is an increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the last 15 years for critically ill neonates. While receiving ECMO therapy, the critically ill infant needs various medications. We performed an in vitro study to evaluate the potential effect of the membrane oxygenator on drug extraction. Two closed ECMO circuits were set up at rates of 320 ml/min. One circuit was new and the other was used clinically for 5 days. Morphine at 8 ng/ml, gentamicin 10 micrograms/ml, vancomycin 40 micrograms/ml, phenobarbital 20 micrograms/ml, and phenytoin 20 micrograms/ml were injected into the circuit at 1-h intervals. Blood samples were drawn from the circuit at 10, 30, 60, and 240 minutes after injection. In the new circuit, drugs were eliminated as follows: vancomycin 36%, gentamicin 10%, phenobarbital 17%, phenytoin 43%, morphine 36%. In the used system, levels fell to a much smaller extent: vancomycin 11%, phenobarbital 6%, gentamicin 0%, phenytoin 0%, and morphine 16%. In a child receiving 20 micrograms/kg/h infusion of morphine, steady-state concentrations of 68.2 ng/ml fell to 11.6 ng/ml after changing the membrane. Our data indicate that the ECMO is associated with lowering of the concentrations of commonly used medications and that this process may depend partially on how new the membrane is. Before these changes may lead to new dosing guidelines for small children receiving ECMO, more experiments with new and used systems are warranted, as well as with different types of ECMO."

We reperformed our analysis using a cutoff for hyperoxemia obtained by comparisons of observed versus predicted mortality when encounters were classified by highest PaO2 in 50 torr (6.67 kPa) bins. Results are reported as adjusted odds ratios with 95% CIs. Of 23,719 encounters, 4,093 had a PaO2 recorded in the period -6 to +6 hours after admission.

It was primarily developed as a simple calibration for the PulseCO trade mark (LiDCO, London, UK) continuous arterial waveform analysis monitor. The technique is quick and simple, requiring only an arterial line and central or peripheral venous access. These lines would probably already have been inserted in critical care patients. A small dose of lithium chloride is injected as an intravenous bolus, and cardiac output is derived from the dilution curve generated by a lithium-sensitive electrode attached to the arterial line. Studies in humans and animals have shown good agreement compared with results obtained with other techniques, and the efficacy of LiDCO trade mark in pediatric patients has also been proven. Compared with thermodilution, lithium dilution showed closer agreement in clinical studies with electromagnetic flow measurement.PulseCO trade mark is a beat-to-beat cardiac output monitor that calculates stroke volume from the arterial pressure waveform using an autocorrelation algorithm. The algorithm is not dependent on waveform morphology, but, rather, it calculates nominal stroke volume from a pressure-volume transform of the entire waveform. The nominal stroke volume is converted to actual stroke volume by calibration of the algorithm with LiDCO trade mark. Initial studies indicate good fidelity, and the results from centers in the United States and the United Kingdom are extremely encouraging. The PulseCO trade mark monitor incorporates software for interpretation of the hemodynamic data generated and provides a real-time analysis of arterial pressure variations (ie, stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, and systolic pressure variation) as theoretical guides to intravascular and cardiac filling."

A specially trained anaesthesia team, an appropriate environment and appropriate paediatric-sized equipment (endotracheal tubes, cannulas) represent key factors in determining the perioperative outcome for this population. Other important equipment that must be adapted to the paediatric population include: Non-invasive anaesthesia monitoring equipment (ECG, blood pressure cuff, pulse oximetry, capnography, oxygen monitor, volatile gas concentration monitor, peripheral nerve stimulator and temperature probe); as well as specialised ventilators that allow pressure- and volume-controlled ventilation with volumes as low as 20 ml, variable high frequency ventilation up to 60 breaths per minute and paediatric ventilator hose systems with automatic correction for compliance. Perioperative pain management is important in the paediatric population, with regional anaesthesia techniques (usually done under general anaesthesia) being increasingly accepted in all age groups. These techniques, however, should be performed by experienced anaesthesologists and surgeons only. If these conditions are not met, surgical procedures should not be performed except in the case of an emergency when transportation to a specialised paediatric facility cannot be done safely.

Thirty-seven neonates had transcutaneous oxygen measured with the Hewlett Packard (HPO2 group), 38 neonates had transcutaneous carbon dioxide measured with the Hewlett Packard (HPCO2 group) and the Fastrac was used on 27 neonates (FTCO2 group). Both devices were operated with electrode temperatures of 43.5 degrees C although an additional ten subjects were studied using the Fastrac with an electrode temperature of 43.0 degrees C. The mean differences (transcutaneous--arterial) and upper and lower limits of agreement were calculated for each group. For the HPO2 group they were 3.78 mmHg (-12.23 to 19.80 mmHg), for the HPCO2 group they were 0.40 mmHg (-4.50 to 5.30 mmHg) and for the FTCO2 they were -0.96 mmHg (-7.85 to 5.92 mmHg). For the Fastrac group at an electrode temperature of 43.0 degrees C the mean difference and limits of agreement were -1.00 mmHg and -4.58 mmHg to 2.58 mmHg. The average sensitivity and specificity for both machines for the detection of hypocarbia were 82% and 92% respectively while for hypercarbia they were 90% and 94% respectively.

Continuous renal replacement therapy after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation start was indicated for three patients. When patients on continuous venovenous hemofiltration were compared with patients not on continuous venovenous hemofiltration, diuretic administration was lower (1.5 vs. 10 mg/kg/day), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation duration was longer (7 [range, 6-14]) vs. 4 [range, 3-8] days), and survival decreased from 60% (four of seven) to 33% (one of three).

Patients who were randomized to receive conventional mechanical ventilation were treated with a strategy that utilized increases in end-expiratory pressure and inspiratory time to increase mean airway pressure and to limit increases in peak inspiratory pressure. Target blood gas values were the same for both groups.

There were no differences between the groups in duration of mechanical ventilation, frequency of airleak, Airleak Scores, or 30-day survival rates. Significantly fewer patients treated with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation required supplemental oxygenation at 30 days compared with patients managed with conventional ventilation.

Effective evidenced-based practice is limited for the management of post-operative chylothorax in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit. The study characterizes the population of pediatric patients with cardiac surgery and chylothorax who eventually require pleurodesis and/or thoracic duct ligation; it also establishes objective data on the impact of various medical interventions. Data were obtained from the Pediatric Health Information System database from 2004-2015. Inclusion criteria for admissions for this study were pediatric admissions, cardiac diagnosis, cardiac surgery, and chylothorax. These data were then divided into two groups: those that did and did not require surgical intervention for chylothorax. Other data points obtained included congenital heart malformation, age, gender, length of stay, billed charges, and inpatient mortality. A total of 3503 pediatric admissions with cardiac surgery and subsequent chylothorax were included. Of these, 236 (9.4%) required surgical intervention for the chylothorax. The following cardiac diagnoses, cardiac surgeries, and comorbidities were associated with increased odds of surgical intervention: d-transposition, arterial switch, mitral valvuloplasty, acute kidney injury, need for dialysis, cardiac arrest, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Statistically significant medical interventions which did have an impact were specific steroids (hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone) and specific diuretics (furosemide). These were significantly associated with decreased length of stay and costs. Dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and furosemide were associated with decreased odds for surgical intervention. These analyses offer objective data regarding the effects of interventions for chylothorax in pediatric cardiac surgery admissions. Results from this study seem to indicate that most post-operative chylothoraxes should improve with furosemide, a low-fat diet, and steroids."

            "abstract": "Recent development of sophisticated intensive care technique for use in newborn infants with the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) has resulted in changes in the therapeutic strategies and moved the problem of neonatal survival into the realm of new therapeutic realities. At present, the mechanical ventilation methods form an integral part of the intensive care strategy of infants with RDS. They have come to the forefront of infant care because of their successful use in ventilatory support and children survival where other therapeutic modalities have failed. The present prospective observational longitudinal study was designed to assess the real-time convenience, reliability and accuracy of the changes in the oxygenation index (OI), arterial-to-alveolar oxygen tension ratio (a/A PO2) and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-a)DO2 in ventilator-dependent neonates with RDS, to analyze their feasibility and potential information yield in oxygen inhalation therapy as well as their prognostic implications and predictive value. Twenty neonates with RDS, heralded by respiratory failure which necessitated the initiation of oxygen inhalation therapy and ventilatory support within 24 hours of birth, were enrolled in the study. Ten of the infants survived and the remaining ten died. OI, (a/A PO2) and (A-a)DO2 were followed up sequentially and thoroughly analyzed as the primary outcome measures of the study. The indices were calculated on the basis of the complete monitoring of the ventilatory equipment parameters and acid-base status carried out on an hourly basis. Our results show that: 1. The combination of three indexes (OI, (a/A)PO2 and (A-a)DO2 we propose is a useful discriminating predictor of neonatal lung maturity reflecting arterial blood gas status in ventilator-dependent neonates with RDS. 2. The indices detect the efficacy of the modern conventional ventilatory support with real-time convenience and reliable accuracy forming the cornerstone of clinical decision-making in RDS neonatal intensive care and allowing timely corrections of the ventilatory equipment parameters. 3. The prospective follow-up of these indices improves the predictive value as compared to any single test of neonatal lung maturity and has important prognostic implications in the management of neonates with RDS."

            "abstract": "As of 18 February 2020, the e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) epidemic has claimed the lives of 68 patients in the USA with the total number of reported cases standing at 2807 to date. We present the clinical and radiologic findings, course of illness, and treatment of EVALI in seven adolescent patients in Northeast Ohio. Five of our patients required supplemental oxygen with four requiring intensive care unit care for respiratory support during admission. Three patients were treated with systemic steroids while inpatient. Bilateral opacities were seen on radiographic imaging of all seven of our patients. All patients were discharged alive on room air. However, impaired diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) with nonobstructive spirometry was seen in patients that were tested postdischarge. This suggests that although recovery from the acute illness process of EVALI is achieved, there may be long-term impact on lung function in these patients. We recommend close follow-up with a pediatric pulmonologist where spirometry and DLCO can be performed."

It progresses rapidly and a high level of suspicion is necessary for early diagnosis. Early intervention with aggressive fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy can significantly improve outcome. In the pediatric intensive care unit, a large amount of fluids may be required during the first few days and vasoactive drug infusions are often needed. Coagulopathy is frequent, but it has no specific treatment. The use of colloids and steroids may be beneficial, but other new therapies such as insulin and activated protein C still need further assessment. Rescue therapy with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be appropriate in cases complicated by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, but not for refractory shock. Meningitis is often not diagnosed in MD because of the severity of illness and the inability to perform a lumbar puncture safely in a patient with coagulopathy, coma, or hemodynamic instability. When present, cerebral edema and altered cerebral blood flow are the main concerns. The use of osmolar solution may be necessary, but the main therapeutic intervention is to ensure adequate blood pressure for adequate cerebral perfusion. Seizures and hyponatremia should be aggressively treated. Steroids do not appear to affect outcome in meningococcal meningitis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      MD is a life-threatening infection that requires early recognition and treatment. Time sensitive fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy are the most effective therapies for MD. Other therapies such as steroids may have a place in MD treatment but more definitive studies are necessary."

No effects of age were found for the relation between TcPo2 and Pao2. Over a four hour period, the mean ratio TcPo2/Pao2 rose significantly from 0.96 to 1.04, while the mean ratio of TcPco2/Paco2 fell from 1.65 to 1.62. Five children developed superficial burns which were still present at 48 hours.

Over the past decade, the use of high-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) therapy has increased markedly and it is now utilised not only in the intensive care unit setting but in general paediatric wards and emergency departments. The aim of this systematic review was to summarise and critique the current evidence-base for the use of HFNC in infants with bronchiolitis. We searched Ovid Medline, OvidEmbase, PubMed, Cinahl, Cochrane Library, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials of HFNC therapy in infants with bronchiolitis from 1 January 2000 to 27 June 2018. We identified four randomised controlled trials (n = 1891) of HFNC in infants with bronchiolitis: three of these studies involved infants treated in emergency departments and inpatient paediatric wards in Spain, Australia and New Zealand, and one study involved infants treated in paediatric intensive care units in France. The findings of this review suggest that HFNC should be used as a rescue treatment for hypoxaemic infants who have not responded to standard sub nasal oxygen therapy. The use of HFNC for work of breathing in the absence of hypoxaemia, and severe disease, is not currently supported by the evidence, and should only be considered in the context of an appropriate research trial."

Significant differences in the cardiovascular system of neonates and children in size, weight, body proportions, and metabolism should be considered. Hemodynamic monitoring is crucial for early warning of pending deterioration and to guide therapy. Current monitoring is limited to the macrocirculation, but an adequately functioning macrocirculation does not guarantee a well-functioning microcirculation. Research in children revealed loss of hemodynamic coherence, i.e., microcirculatory alterations despite normal systemic hemodynamics. Implementing the framework of hemodynamic coherence in microcirculatory monitoring in children can aid physicians in titrating therapy on both macrocirculatory and microcirculatory effects to assure optimal oxygen delivery. Monitoring the microcirculation at the bedside requires further technical development. Although more research is necessary to validate the concept of hemodynamic coherence in children, the possibilities of applying this concept in children seem promising."

Most of the deaths occur during first 48 hours of hospitalization. Coma, raised intracranial pressure (ICP), seizures, shock have been identified as significant predictors of death and morbidity. This article reviews issues in critical care with reference to our experience of managing 88 children with ABM in PICU. Attention should first be directed toward basic ABCs of life-support. Children with Glasgow Coma Scale (GSC) score < 8 need intubation and supplemental oxygen. Antibiotics should be started, even without LP (contraindicated if focal neuro-deficit, papilledema, or signs of raised ICP). Raised ICP is present in most of patients; GCS < 8 and high blood pressure are good guides. Mannitol (0.25 gm/Kg) should be used in such patients. If there are signs of (impending) herniation short-term hyperventilation is recommended; prolonged hyperventilation (> 1 hour) must be avoided. Any evidence of poor perfusion, hypovolemia and/or hypotension needs aggressive treatment with normal saline boluses and inotropes, if necessary, to maintain normal blood pressure. Empiric fluid restriction is not justified. Seizures may be controlled with intravenous diazepam or lorazepam. Refractory status epilepticus may be treated with continuous diazepam (0.01-0.06) mg/kg/min) or midazolam infusion. Ventilatory support may be needed early for associated pneumonia, poor respiratory effort and/or coma, and occasionally to reduce work of breathing in shock. Provision of critical care to children with ABM may reduce the mortality significantly as experienced by us."

Patients requiring extracorporeal life support prior to any cardiac intervention, or receiving prophylactic anticoagulation not related to central vascular catheter (CVC) were excluded.

Only the mean airway pressure (MAP, cm H2O) used for supportive care was significantly different on days 0 and 1 (p < 0.05) with higher pressure being used in non-survivors. Multiple logistic regression analysis did not identify any gas exchange or ventilator parameter independently associated with mortality. Rather, all deaths were associated with coincident pathology or multi-organ system failure, or perceived treatment futility due to pre-existing diagnoses instead of unsupportable respiratory failure. When using previously published predictors of outcome (VI > 40 and OI > 40; A-aDO2 > 450 for 24 h; A-aDO2 > 470 or MAP > 23; or A-aDO2 > 420) the risk of mortality was overestimated significantly in the current population.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The original hypothesis was refuted.

            "abstract": "Intelligent application of the monitoring methods forms the mainstay of the diagnostic and treatment strategy in intensive care and is in harmony with the basic principle of minimal handling in neonatal intensive care. Thus, based on the monitoring data it is possible to derive a number of equipment, oxygen-derivative, respiratory, hemodynamic, metabolic and other indices. The information provided by these indices is significantly greater and more important than that gained from the initial data (ventilatory parameters) and biologic variables). It is of foremost importance for the successful performance of both conventional and nonconventional ventilation techniques and the evaluation of the newborn status as well as for prognostic discussions and conclusions. In the present study we used the Neonatal Intensive Computer File developed by the author with graphic trends for visualization of the dynamics of indices over time in each and every one of the neonates in our groups of patients which are statistically analyzed using standard methods and computer models. A total of 30 neonates (14 survived and 16 non-survived) who had been treated with conventional ventilation during the neonatal period were enrolled in the study. Our results show that: 1. The dynamics of indices between the survived and the non-survived shows significant differences in terms of values, dynamics and general tendency. 2. Major relationships between the different indices are observed and their correct interpretation improves the information yield of each and every one of the above-mentioned indices. There are identical tendencies in the dynamics of MAP, OI and VI values in the survived whereas in the non-survived these indices are discordant. The improvement in a/A values coincides in time with that of AaDO2 reduction, or the improvement in oxygenation is accompanied by a reduction of the degree of shunting in the survived which is a favorable prognostic indication, whereas decrease in a/A values in the presence of practically unchanged AaDO2 values suggests an unfavorable outcome. The improvement in compliance is accompanied by improvement in the rate of oxygenation in the survivor group whereas in the non-survivors the deterioration in oxygenation is accompanied by a decrease in compliance and reflects the major underlying pathologic mechanism of gas exchange. 3. The panel of indices used by us specifies exactly the onset of the changes in gas exchange. 4. The application of the panel of indices contributes to more profound diagnostic reasoning and conclusions as well as the therapy and prognosis ad vitam."

Ideally, we would like to have monitoring that can rapidly and accurately identify perturbations in circulatory well-being that would permit timely intervention and allow for restoration before the patient is damaged. The evidence to support the use of our standard monitoring strategies (continuous electrocardiography, blood pressure, central venous pressure, oxygen saturation and capnography) is based on expert opinion, case series, or at best observational studies. While these monitoring parameters will identify life-threatening events, they provide no direct information concerning the oxygen economy of the patient. Nevertheless, they are mandated by professional societies representing specialists in cardiac disease, critical care, and anesthesiology. Additional non-routine monitoring strategies that provide data concerning the body's oxygen economy, such as venous saturation monitoring and near infrared spectroscopy, have shown promise in prospective observational studies in managing these complex groups of patients. Ideally, high-level evidence would be required before adopting these newer strategies, but in the absence of new funding sources and the challenges of the wide variation in practice patterns between centers, this seems unlikely. The evidence supporting the current standard perioperative monitoring strategies will be reviewed.

Unfortunately, the data supporting the use of these adjunct therapies are often unclear, conflicting, or absent. This review will present the physiologic basis and summarize the supporting data for a host of adjunct therapies, including ipratropium, intravenous β agonists, methylxanthines, intravenous and inhaled magnesium, heliox (helium-oxygen mixture), ketamine, antibiotics, noninvasive ventilation, inhaled anesthetics, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Using HFNC was associated with a significant reduction in IV initiated by the retrieval team (multivariate OR 0.51; 95 % CI 0.27-0.95; p = 0.032).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We report on a major change of practice in transport of critically ill children in our retrieval system. HFNC therapy was increasingly used and was not inferior to low-flow oxygen or NIV.

            "abstract": "The Medos Deltastream DP3 system is made up of a novel diagonal pump and hollow-membrane oxygenator that provides nonpulsatile and pulsatile flows for extracorporeal life support (ECLS). The objectives of this study are to (i) evaluate the efficacy of the hemodynamic energy provided by Medos Deltastream DP3 system in nonpulsatile and pulsatile mode and (ii) to evaluate the pulsatile mode under different frequencies. The experimental ECLS circuit was used in this study, primed with Ringer's lactate and packed red blood cells (hematocrit 35%). All trials were conducted at flow rates of 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mL/min with modified pulsatile frequencies of 60, 70, 80, and 90 bpm at 36°C. Simultaneous blood flow and pressures at the pre/postoxygenator and pre/postcannula sites were recorded for quantification of the pulsatile perfusion-generated energy-equivalent pressure (EEP), surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE), and total hemodynamic energy (THE). The experiments showed that under pulsatile flow conditions, at all flow rates and frequencies, (i) the EEP, SHE, and THE were significantly higher when compared with the nonpulsatile group and (ii) the pressure drop was minimal at lower flow rates and lower pulsatile frequencies but was significant when either the flow rate or the pulsatile frequency was increased. The Medos Deltastream DP3 System can provide nonpulsatile flow and physiologic quality pulsatile flow for pediatric ECLS. When the Medos DP3 pediatric ECLS system is used with pulsatile flow, there is more surplus hemodynamic energy and total hemodynamic energy than nonpulsatile flow."

            "abstract": "End-organ dysfunction is associated with increased mortality in pediatric cardiac patients requiring extracorporeal support. We sought to characterize the odds of developing acute renal failure (ARF) as well as associated increases in mortality in this population. Records of all cardiac patients in our pediatric intensive care unit receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) over a 24 month period were reviewed for data with respect to their course. Acute renal failure was defined as fluid retention or electrolyte disturbance resulting in institution of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), or a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of <35 ml/min/1.73 m. Analysis revealed 49 ECMO runs in 48 patients, with ARF present in 71.7%, and CRRT initiated in 58.7%. Odds for developing ARF increased by 60% per day of ECMO support (beta 1.60, 95% CI 1.08-2.37, p = 0.018). Acute renal failure during ECMO, after adjusting for patient age, remained associated with a decrease in odds of survival to discharge (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.10-20.4, p = 0.037). We conclude that ARF is more common among pediatric cardiac patients requiring extracorporeal support than previously recognized. Increasing duration of ECMO support is associated with development of ARF. Acute renal failure while on ECMO is associated with a significant decrease in the odds of survival in the pediatric cardiac patient."

It has been convincingly demonstrated that serial samples obtained by arterial puncture are inadequate for controlling oxygen supply. An ideal correlation between arterial and transcutaneous pO2 was obtained when the control arterial sample was taken via an indwelling arterial catheter and artefacts, e.g. reaction to the needle puncture, had been eliminated. The necessary percentage of oxygen in the inspiratory mixture can be accurately gauged by continously measuring arterial pO2, as can changes brought about by the application of positive end-expiratory pressure in children on long-term ventilation. The transcutaneous measurement makes it possible to improve continuous monitoring of critically ill patients, and to carry out sparingly and safely long-term ventilation in them."

In adults, isoflurane has been described to decrease CBF to a lesser extent than fentanyl and midazolam. Most large-animal models of neurocritical care use inhaled anesthetics for anesthesia. Investigations involving modulations of CBF would have improved translatability within a model that more closely approximates the current practice in the pediatric intensive care unit.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Fifteen 4-week-old piglets were given 1 of 2 anesthetic protocols: total IV anesthesia (TIVA) (midazolam 1 mg/kg/h and fentanyl 100 μg/kg/h, n = 8) or ISO (isoflurane 1.5%-2% and fentanyl 100 μg/kg/h, n = 7).

In this review, contemporary ventilatory methods, supportive treatments, and future developments relevant to pediatric critical care are reviewed.\n    \n\n\n          Data synthesis:\n        \n      \n      A strategy combining recruitment maneuvers, low-tidal volume, and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) decreases barotrauma and volutrauma. Given that appropriate tidal volumes are critical in determining adequate alveolar ventilation and avoiding lung injury, volume-control ventilation with high PEEP levels has been proposed as the preferable protective ventilatory mode. Pressure-related volume control ventilation and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) have taken on an important role as protective lung strategies. Further data are required in the treatment of children, confirming the preliminary results in specific lung pathologies. Spontaneous breathing supported artificially during inspiration (pressure support ventilation) is widely used to maintain or reactivate spontaneous breathing and to avoid hemodynamic variation. Volume support ventilation reduces the need for manual adaptation to maintain stable tidal and minute volume and can be useful in weaning. Prone positioning and permissive hypercapnia have taken on an important role in the treatment of patients undergoing artificial ventilation.

Mortality in patients with pulmonary hypertension was 51.3% compared with 44.8% (p = 0.001) in those without pulmonary hypertension. In univariate analyses, significant predictors of mortality included age less than 6 months and greater than 5 years; pre-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cardiac arrest; pre-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation blood gas with pH less than 7.12, PaCO2 greater than 75, PaO2 less than 35, and arterial oxygen saturation less than 60%; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation duration greater than 280 hours; extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation complications including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, inotropic support, myocardial stun, tamponade, pulmonary hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, seizures, other hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal replacement therapy, mechanical/circuit problem, and metabolic acidosis. A co-diagnosis of pneumonia was associated with significantly lower odds of mortality (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8). Prediction models were developed using three sets of variables: 1) pre-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (age, absence of pneumonia, and pH < 7.12; area under the curve, 0.62); 2) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation related (extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation, any neurologic complication, pulmonary hemorrhage, renal replacement therapy, and metabolic acidosis; area under the curve, 0.72); and 3) all variables combined (area under the curve, 0.75) (p < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Children with pulmonary hypertension who require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support have a significantly greater odds of mortality compared with those without pulmonary hypertension. Risk factors for mortality include age, absence of pneumonia, pre-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation acidosis, extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation, pulmonary hemorrhage, neurologic complications, renal replacement therapy, and acidosis while on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Identification of those pulmonary hypertension patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation who are at even higher risk for mortality may inform clinical decision-making and improve prognostic awareness."

            "abstract": "We postulated that the fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2) required to achieve a certain value of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) can be used as an indicator of pulmonary gas exchange impairment in patients during mechanical ventilation. We tested this hypothesis in 20 patients. By reducing FIO2 in increments of 10 vol% of capacity while monitoring SaO2 with pulse oximetry, we could determine FI98, FI97, FI96, and FI95; that is, the FIO2 that yields 98, 97, 96, and 95% SaO2, respectively. On the basis of our data, we chose FI98 as the most appropriate index, as an SaO2 of 97% or below could not be achieved even with a low FIO2 in some of the patients. To test the significance of the newly proposed index, we compared FI98 with the alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference, P(A - a)O2, and with the respiratory index, which are routinely used elsewhere. The correlation between FI98 and P(A - a)O2 was excellent: P(A - a)O2 = 490.5 * FI98 + 117.2 with a correlation coefficient of 0.906 (P less than 0.01). FI98 also correlated significantly with the respiratory index: respiratory index = 4.354 * FI98 - 0.776 (r = 0.889, P less than 0.01). We conclude that FI98 may be used as a simple index for the rough estimation of pulmonary gas exchange impairment without the need for invasive procedures. However, further studies are needed to confirm the validity of our method in hemodynamically unstable patients or when other brands of pulse oximeters are used."

Demographic data and clinical and cardiorespiratory parameters were evaluated, and patients who did not progress to ETI in 48 h after withdrawal of NIV were classified as \"success group\", whereas those who progressed to ETI were included in the \"failure group\". Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the predictive factors of failure to prevent ETI.

Currently, there are no approved treatments for CoronaVirus Disease 19 (COVID-19); however, therapeutic strategies based on the preclinical evidence include supportive measures, such as oxygen supplementation, antiviral, and anticoagulant agents. Despite these treatments, 10% of patients worsen and develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since the pathogenic mechanism of ARDS is an uncontrolled inflammatory state, we speculate that removing inflammation effectors from blood may contrast tissue injury and improve clinical outcome. In a scenario of dramatic medical emergency, we conducted an observational study on 9 consecutive patients hospitalized in COVID Intensive Care Unit, where 5 of 9 consecutive patients were treated with HP, due to the emergency overload made it impossible to deliver blood purification in the other 4 patients. COVID-19 was diagnosed through the identification of virus sequences by reverse transcription-PCR on respiratory specimens. All patients had severe pneumonia requiring continuous positive airway pressure. HP was started in all patients 6-7 days after hospital admission. The treated patients (T) received 2 consecutive sessions of HP using CytoSorb cartridge. Our results show a better clinical course of T compared to control patients (C), in fact all T except 1 survived, and only 2 of them were intubated, while all C required intubation and died. Lymphocytopenia worsened in C but not in T. C-reactive protein decreased in both patients, but to a greater extent in T. IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α decreased after HP, IL-10 did not change. Respiratory function remained stable and did not worsen in T compared to C. The limited sample size and observational study design preclude a sound statement about the potential effectiveness of HP in COVID-19 patients, but our experience suggests a potential therapeutic role of adjuvant CytoSorb HP in the early course of CO-VID-19 pneumonia.

The average difference in mean assay values between the reference instrument and the test instrument was -0.59%, i.e., < 1% methemoglobin. Repeated measurements indicated the precision was 0.5% methemoglobin. Complete hemolysis of the sample reduced the methemoglobin reading by only 0.40%. Adding bilirubin (10 to 11 mg/dL [171 to 188.1 mumol/L]), increased the methemoglobin reading by 0.23%, increased the oxyhemoglobin reading by 0.45%, and increased total hemoglobin by 0.21 g/dL.

The test instrument automatically detects the presence of the cuvette, analyzes the sample, and displays the results in < 10 secs. The findings in this study indicate that the test instrument has sufficient accuracy for near-patient testing in intensive care units. The errors introduced by hemolysis, fetal hemoglobin, and bilirubin were too small to be of clinical importance. Thus, the test instrument is essentially unaffected by complications commonly encountered in neonatal blood. The capacity of the test instrument to measure methemoglobin makes it particularly useful if inhaled nitric oxide therapy becomes a standard clinical practice."

Recovery of neutrophils, whether prior to or after initiation of IMV, was associated with a significantly decreased risk of death relative to never achieving neutrophil recovery. A transient increase in acuity (by oxygenation index and vasopressor requirements) occurred among a subset of the patients who achieved neutrophil recovery after initiation of IMV; 61.5% of these patients survived to discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). Improved survival among patients who subsequently achieved neutrophil recovery on IMV was not limited to those with peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome. The presence of a respiratory pathogen did not affect the risk of death while on IMV but was associated with an increased length of IMV (p < 0.01). Among patients undergoing HCT who develop respiratory failure and require advanced therapeutic support, neutrophil recovery at time of IMV and/or presence of a respiratory pathogen should not be used as determining factors when counseling families about survival."

The goal is to extend life in stable condition to the point of transplantation. Postoperative care focuses on optimizing perfusion of the mesenteric circulation by maintaining intravascular volume, minimizing hypercoagulability, and providing adequate oxygen delivery. Careful monitoring of the stoma and its output and correction of electrolyte imbalances that may require renal replacement therapy is critical, as are monitoring for and aggressively treating infections, which often present with only subtle clinical clues.

            "abstract": "In pediatric cardiac surgery, there is a substantial gap between published recommendations or guidelines for blood product use and clinical practice. The drawbacks of blood transfusion are well acknowledged though. The aim of this paper is to present the rationale for packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets used in pediatric patients. Blood hemoglobin level is the current trigger used for packed red blood cells transfusion, though commonly admitted to be suboptimal. An increase in hemoglobin level is likely to be associated with an increase in blood oxygen content and blood oxygen delivery. However, above a critical level of hemoglobin, normovolemic anemia is well tolerated, and any increase in hemoglobin will fail to increase oxygen consumption and therefore to improve end-organ oxygen supply. FFP is one way to address the coagulation factors deficiency induced by hemodilution, consumption, or hepatic insufficiency. The volume needed to increase these factors is not negligible. To avoid dilution and/or fluid overload, the use of clotting factor concentrate is recommended. The same remark can be made regarding the treatment of antithrombin III deficiency. Platelets infusion should be restricted to bleeding patients with thrombocytopenia and without surgical bleeding. In clinical studies, the prevention of bleeding through prophylactic infusion of platelets proved to be useless. Optimizing the use of blood products (avoiding overuse, underuse, and inappropriate use) is a challenging task in pediatric cardiac surgery. Data or guidelines cannot replace clinical judgment and the decision to transfuse is left to individual discretion, but the medical community needs to optimize its transfusion practice, otherwise policy-makers without similar expertise may step in to regulate the use of blood products."

Primary brain injury is irreversible, but secondary insults can be limited. Central to this is the management of raised intracranial pressure (ICP). The pathophysiology of head injury can explain some of the causes of raised ICP. Monitoring of ICP is important and this is closely linked to the maintenance of an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure and the importance of normovolaemia. Other interventions that have been shown to limit rises in ICP are appropriate use of positioning, mechanical ventilation and drug therapy. Less common therapies include jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation monitoring and the use of trometamol (THAM). Most nursing interventions do not actively reduce ICP, but they are central to its management. Reducing stimuli, avoiding cluster care, manual hyperinflation and limiting routine endotracheal suction may prevent an accumulative rise in ICP. Based on this literature review, it is possible to divide these interventions into first and second tier treatments, as shown in the protocol. Much of the suggested management will occur simultaneously, but it is important to assess the child's own response to each intervention and thus tailor treatment to minimize secondary brain injury."

In particular, we aim to explore if a NIOD performed by non-specialized personnel is not inferior to the standard chest physiotherapy (CPT) undertaken by physiotherapists caring for patients with COVID-19.\n    \n\n\n          Trial design:\n        \n      \n      A pilot multicenter prospective crossover noninferiority randomized controlled trial.\n    \n\n\n          Participants:\n        \n      \n      All mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 admitted to one of the two ICUs, and CPT ordered by the responsible physician. The participants will be recruited from two intensive care units in Canadian Academic Hospitals (one pediatric and one adult ICU).\n    \n\n\n          Intervention and comparator:\n        \n      \n      We will implement NIOD and CPT alternatingly for 3 h apart over 3 h. We will apply a pragmatic design, so that other procedures including hypertonic saline nebulization, intermittent positive pressure ventilation, suctioning (e.g., oral or nasal), or changing the ventilator settings or modality (i.e., increasing positive end-expiratory pressure or changing the nasal mask to total face continuous positive airway pressure) can be provided at the direction of bedside intensivists in charge.\n    \n\n\n          Main outcomes:\n        \n      \n      The primary outcome measurement is the oxygenation level before and after the procedure (SpO2/FiO2 ratio). For cases with invasive ventilation (i.e., the use of an endotracheal tube to deliver positive pressure) and non-invasive ventilation, we will also document expiratory tidal volume, vital signs, and any related complications such as vomiting, hypoxemia, or unexpected extubation. We will collect the data before, 10 min after, and 30 min after the procedure.\n    \n\n\n          Randomization:\n        \n      \n      The order of the procedures (i.e., NIOD or CPT) will be randomly allocated using manual generated random numbers for each case. Randomization will be carried out by the independent research assistant in the study coordinating center by using opaque sealed envelopes, assigning an equal number of cases to each intervention arm. Stratification will be applied for age (> 18 years or ≤ 18 years of age) and the study sites.\n    \n\n\n          Blinding (masking):\n        \n      \n      No blinding will be performed.\n    \n\n\n          Numbers to be randomized (sample size):\n        \n      \n      We estimate the necessary sample size as 25 for each arm (total 50 cases), with a power of 0.90 and an alpha of 0.05, with a non-inferiority design.\n    \n\n\n          Trial status:\n        \n      \n      The protocol version number 1 was approved on 27 March 2020.

We sought to identify current practice patterns of HFOV, investigate parameters during HFOV and their association with mortality, and compare the use of HFOV to conventional mechanical ventilation in severe pediatric ARDS.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This is a retrospective analysis of a multi-center database of pediatric and young adult allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant subjects requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for critical illness from 2009 through 2014. Twelve United States pediatric centers contributed data. Continuous variables were compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test or a Kruskal-Wallis analysis.

Survivors were transitioned to HFOV earlier in the course of mechanical ventilation, (day 0 vs day 2, P = .002). No subject survived who was transitioned to HFOV after 1 week of invasive mechanical ventilation. We compared subjects with severe pediatric ARDS treated only with conventional mechanical ventilation versus early HFOV (within 2 d of invasive mechanical ventilation) versus late HFOV. There was a trend toward difference in survival (conventional mechanical ventilation 24%, early HFOV 30%, and late HFOV 9%, P = .08).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this large database of pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant subjects who had acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for critical illness with severe pediatric ARDS, early use of HFOV was associated with improved survival compared to late implementation of HFOV, and the subjects had outcomes similar to those treated only with conventional mechanical ventilation."

            "abstract": "The occurrence of hypoxia during endotracheal tube suctioning and its prevention was examined in 25 hemodynamically stable and non-cyanosed pediatric patients. In each patient 4 suction and treatment protocols were studied: 1. pre- and post-suction arterial blood gases (ABG) with no treatment (control). 2. ABG with pre-suction oxygenation. 3. ABG with presuction hyperinflation. 4. ABG with postsuction hyperinflation. With no presuction treatment the PO2 and saturation fell significantly after suctioning from control level of 116.6 +/- 9.4 mmHg to 93 +/- 9.3 mmHg post-suction and 97.2 +/- 0.4% to 92.8 +/- 1.4% (p less than 0.001) respectively. In 6 patients with low but adequate pre-suction PO2, hypoxic levels (PO2 less than 60 mmHg) were found post-suction. The significant fall in PO2 was completely prevented by pre-suction oxygenation. Post-suction hyperinflation induced a rapid return of the PO2 to control levels. These results suggest that severe hypoxia might occur during endotracheal suctioning and can be prevented by pre-oxygenation. We recommend 1 min oxygenation with FiO2 1.0 prior to suctioning procedures and intermittent hyperinflation with 100% oxygen during repeated endotracheal suction passes to prevent hypoxia, especially in children in respiratory failure who already have low or borderline pre-suction PO2."

They are treated in around 150 level 1 perinatal centers and there are various credos how to best treat the ELGAN infant. However, many centers include the use of a sustained inflation for lung aeration in the standard protocol of delivery room care in Germany. As a result of the large studies on delivery room care, a trend for earlier or prophylactic surfactant in the most immature infants can be observed, however, surfactant is increasingly given in a new less invasive way called LISA. German randomized controlled trials on LISA , on permissive hypercapnia in the premature infants and a German initiated European trial on inhaled steroids have been completed and preliminary results are available. NIRS so far mostly is used for research reasons; however, the number of centers that monitor brain oxygenation for clinical reasons to guide hemodynamic management is increasing.

            "abstract": "In a retrospective study, urinary malondialdehyde concentration in 45 preterm neonates (25-35 weeks' gestation) during their first month of life was measured by HPLC. Urine was collected on different days of life as a 3-h sample. The frequency of urine collection and measurement varied between one (n = 22) and seven times (n = 8) per child. The study group was divided into three categories according to birth weight: low-birth-weight infants (LBW) (n = 16), very low-birth-weight infants (VLBW) (n = 17) and extremely low-birth-weight infants (ELBW) (n = 12). Urinary malondialdehyde concentration was highest in the ELBW group: 1.15 (0.66, 2.12) mumol/l (median and quartiles) versus 0.58 (0.34, 1.18) mumol/l in the VLBW and 0.60 (0.40, 1.06) mumol/l in the LBW groups (ELBW versus VLBW, p < 0.005; ELBW versus LBW, p < 0.02). In oxygen-treated neonates, significantly higher malondialdehyde values were found compared to those without supplementary oxygen (0.89 (0.48, 1.74) versus 0.58 (0.32, 0.89) mumol/l; p < 0.005). Likewise, a higher malondialdehyde concentration was found in infants requiring mechanical ventilation (intermittent mandatory IMV or high frequency ventilation) compared to those breathing spontaneously (intermittent mandatory ventilation: 0.80 (0.42, 1.66); p > 0.05 and high frequency ventilation: 1.20 (0.83, 2.13); p < 0.001 versus 0.57 (0.33, 0.88) mumol/l). Malondialdehyde concentrations correlated significantly with FiO2 values of the individual patients (r = 0.22; p < 0.02). Comparing urinary malondialdehyde concentrations in infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a significantly higher malondialdehyde concentration was found in the former group (0.96 (0.51, 2.07) versus 0.60 (0.32, 0.98) mumol/l; p < 0.005)).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Goal-directed therapy has become the key to resuscitating critically ill patients since 2001. However, the ideal marker to guide pediatric resuscitation has remained elusive.The ideal marker is specific, sensitive, easy to use, safe, validated, and cost-effective. Lactate and base deficit are validated prognosticators, but both are affected by confounding conditions and resuscitative efforts. Mixed venous oximetry has been successfully used for guiding therapy but requires a pulmonary artery catheter for measurement. Central venous oximetry, on the other hand, can be more easily measured and is now the standard of care in goal-directed therapy for adult septic shock. Pediatric literature related to central venous oximetry is still in relative infancy, but seems promising. Sublingual capnometry may also prove to be useful, but no pediatric research has been published related to this device. Finally, near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring may be useful in highlighting changes in patient conditions, but its use in goal-directed therapy is limited by the wide interpatient variability. In summary, the search for the ideal marker of tissue perfusion continues, but there is promise on the horizon."

Because these procedures used the filtration exchange method, it was performed in a timely fashion by intensive care unit personnel and on equipment already available in the intensive care unit for renal support.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This very limited case series suggest there may be a role for therapeutic plasma exchange as a rescue therapy in severe shock and acute lung injury related to pH1N1 that has not responded to traditional therapy."

A systematic review was conducted to identify studies characterising the hemodynamic effects of milrinone in children during critical illness for hemodynamic support for various medical conditions. Studies were assessed for quality and those of satisfactory quality with pre- and post-operative hemodynamics for each patient were included in the final analyses. Those not limited to children and those not limited to patients with critical illness were excluded from the final analyses. A total of six studies with 791 patients were included in the final analyses. Milrinone infusion doses ranged from 0.3 to 0.75 mcg/kg/minute with the mean infusion dose being 0.5 mcg/kg/minute. Patients whom received milrinone infusion had greater cardiac output, greater left ventricle shortening fraction, lower right ventricular systolic pressure, and lower serum lactate levels. Systolic blood pressure mean arterial blood pressure and arterial oxygen concentration did not significantly change with administration of milrinone. These results were irrespective of milrinone infusion dose, infusion duration, and study size.

We hypothesized that regional practice variation occurred in the care of term infants and that these differences would be reflected in the hospitalization patterns of infants. All infants cared for in an Intensive Care Nursery (ICN) after maternal discharge in 1 of 3 major metropolitan areas followed up by the same neonatal management company were compared (n=4,487). Term infants were grouped into 1 of 2 categories based on illness severity: Group 1 (G1) infants-those who required supplemental oxygen or ventilation for 24 hours or more (n=611); and Group 2 (G2) infants-those infants without an oxygen or ventilation requirement (n=1,549). Excluded were infants in the following categories: birth weight <2,500 grams, major congenital anomalies, surgical patients, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, or babies who died before discharge. The number of infants in each of these categories was compared as a percentage of the total number of infants cared for in that region. The average length of stay (ALOS) and percentage of patient days attributed to infants in each category were compared across regions using multiple comparison tests (Tukey). The total ALOS was greatest in City A, as was the ALOS for sick term infants. Patient days for sick term infants were lowest in City C, and healthier term infants comprised the lowest percentage of patient days in City A. This difference resulted in the lowest percentage of patient days for all term admissions in City A. These data demonstrated that significant variation existed in the delivery of care to term neonates among major metropolitan regions. Cities that admitted fewer term infants for observation periods (G2) tended to have sicker term neonates with higher acuity hospitalizations (GI) and longer lengths of stay (LOS). These findings suggested that a conservative admission policy for this population can decrease overall LOS."

Milrinone has been shown to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure in pediatric patients and neonates postcardiac surgery. We aimed to evaluate the postoperative outcome in such patients with three different fixed maintenance doses of milrinone.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology:\n        \n      \n      Patients were randomized into three groups. All patients received fixed bolus dose of milrinone 50 μg/kg on pump during rewarming. Following this, patients in low-dose group received infusion of milrinone at the rate of 0.375 μg/kg/min, medium-dose group received 0.5 μg/kg/min, and high-dose group received 0.75 μg/kg/min over 24 h. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean airway pressure (MaP), oxygenation index (OI), and central venous pressure (CVP) were compared at baseline and 24 h postoperatively.

            "abstract": "If ECMO is to be used effectively in pediatric patients, specifically in those with burns, the candidates must be chosen with care. Unlike the situation in neonates, when ECMO is being considered for use in a pediatric patient, no clear set of inclusion or exclusion criteria exists. Evaluation of a pediatric patient for ECMO support is largely based on an assessment of the patient's condition and a center's previous experience with pediatric ECMO. The data that are available through ELSO indicate that survival decreases as the number of days a patient receives mechanical ventilation before the initiation of ECMO increases. The effect of burns on patients' outcomes is unknown. Age, duration of mechanical ventilation, and excision with allografting or homografting of the burns should all be considered before the patient is offered ECMO support. The remaining prognostic signs--duration of ECMO support, frequency of complications, and blood product requirements--are available only after the ECMO course is under way or completed. The success of our center and others in using ECMO to treat respiratory failure associated with burns shows that some patients with burns may benefit from ECMO. Unfortunately, no specific set of criteria exists that would enable ECMO centers to differentiate good candidates from poor ones and thus be able to offer ECMO support with confidence in its benefit for the patient."

There is little information about experience with this technique in neonates. We report the use of axillary cannulation in 62 mechanically ventilated neonates with birth weight from 750 to 3800 g (mean 1950 g). The axillary artery was catheterized with 24 or 22 gauge teflon catheters by means of the catheter-over-a-needle technique. Arterial access was used for blood pressure monitoring, blood sampling and in seven cases for blood removal during exchange transfusions. Cannulae were removed when the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) was less than 0.3. During cannulation capillary refill, radial artery pulse and neurological status of the arm were checked daily. The mean period of cannulation was 4.1 days (1-10 days).

            "abstract": "Hypoglycaemia defined as blood sugar below 2.5 mmol/L, is always an important medical emergency. The primary therapy is simple and consists of iv glucose. The occurrence of hypoglycaemia is directly connected to fuel balance, determined by the availability of glucose, free fatty acids and ketone bodies. An intact fuel balance and maintenance of normal blood sugar concentration is dependent upon: (1) an adequate caloric and qualitative dietary intake; (2) afunctionally intact hepatic glucogenolytic and gluconeogenic enzyme system; (3) an adequate supply of endogenous gluconeogenic substrates (lactate, amino acids and glycerol) (4) an adequate energy supply provided by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids to synthesize glucose and ketone bodies and (5) a normal endocrine system (insulin, glucagon, catecholamines and growth hormone) for integrating and modulating these processes. Disturbances in each of these factors may lead to hypoglycaemia. Glucose, like oxygen, is of essential and fundamental importance for the brain metabolism. The major contribution of the brain to the basal metabolic rate (70% in neonates versus 20% in adults) is an important factor contributing to the frequency and severity of a hypoglycaemic syndrome in the paediatric age. If hypoglycaemia is suspected, blood should be obtained prior to treatment for serum glucose determination and an extra tube (5 ml) serum should be obtained and refrigerated for further investigations. The first voided urine has to be tested for ketones using a dipstick and also refrigerated for further investigations. Basic laboratory investigations, anamnestic informations and clinical findings allow rapid tentative diagnosis and determine the specialized investigations out of the refrigerated material. A rapid definitive diagnosis is important for the specific treatment and to avoid recurrent and prolonged hypoglycaemia."

The study was conducted between 1st June, 2001 and 30th June, 2003. Total number of patients transferred to PICU were 36. Most patients suffered from respiratory diseases (14 cases, 38.9%) and cardiovascular diseases (8 cases, 22.2%) prior to transfer. Five patients (13.9%) had cardiac arrest and required CPR prior to the transfers. Twelve cases (30%) were transferred at the parents' request or and due to socioeconomic problems. All patients were transported by ambulance. The longest transfer duration was from a hospital in Chiangmai province (11 hours by road transfer). The majority of accompanying medical personnel were nurses (55.5%) with no experience in intensive care pediatrics. In no cases were any doctors or trained paramedics presented with the transport team. Prior to transportation, the PICU physician was phone-contacted by the referring physician. The patients' status prior to being transferred to PICU were as follows; 23 cases (63.9%) were intubated, 4 (11.1%) cases had intravenous cut down and 10 (27.8%) were infused inotropic drug. None of the patients had any record on important patient's data (e.g. vital signs, oxygen saturation) or adverse events during transport such as equipment problems and clinical deteriorations. Twenty eight patients (77.8%) stayed in PICU average length of less than 7 days. Eleven patients died (mortality rate of 30.59%). In conclusion, the major obstacle in properly transporting patients to the PICU was the lack of experience/knowledge of transport team to perform safe transfer in pediatrics during transport. The second problem was lack of documentation or record of vital signs and adverse events observed during the transfer. Organization of effective team working in pediatric transfer to PICU is inevitably needed to improve the outcome of these critically ill patients."

Sixty-six of the 255 patients had a simultaneous measurement of serum lactate.\n    \n\n\n          Measurements and main results:\n        \n      \n      The BEua was calculated using the Fencl-Stewart method. The AG was defined as (sodium plus potassium) - (chloride plus total carbon dioxide). BE was calculated from the standard bicarbonate, which is derived from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and reported on the blood gas analysis. A BE or BEua value of < or =-5 mEq/L or an AG > or =17 mEq/L was defined as a clinically significant presence of unmeasured anions. A lactate level of > or =45 mg/dL was defined as being abnormally elevated for this study. The presence of unmeasured anions identified by significantly abnormal BEua was poorly identified by BE or AG. Of the 255 patients included in the study, 67 (26%) had a different interpretation of acid base balance when the Fencl method was used compared with when BE and AG were used. Plasma lactate concentration correlated better with BEua (r2 = .55; p = .0001) than with AG (r2 = .41; p = .0005) or BE (r2 = .27; p = .025). Mortality was more strongly related to BEua < or =-5 mEq/L (relative risk of death = 10.25; p = .002) than to lactate > or =45 mg/dL (relative risk of death = 2.35; p = .04). In logistic regression analysis, mortality was more strongly associated with BEua (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.79; p = .0002) than lactate (receiver operating characteristic curve area = 0.63; p = .05), BE (receiver operating characteristic curve area = 0.53; p = .32), or AG (receiver operating characteristic curve area = 0.64; p = .08) in this patient sample.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Critically ill patients with normal BE and normal AG frequently have elevated unmeasured anions detectable by BEua. The Fencl-Stewart method is better than BE and similar to AG in identifying patients with high lactate levels. Elevated unmeasured anions identified by the Fencl-Stewart method were more strongly associated with mortality than with BE, AG, or lactate in this patient sample."

In the 19 patients with respiratory failure, NO resulted in an increase in oxygenation in 15 of 19 patients (Pao2/Fio2 ratio increased from 83 +/- 60 mm Hg to 188 +/- 105 mm Hg, P = 0.0007).

None of 11 patients with proven viral pneumonitis survived (P = 0.06) and only one of 20 patients with lung injury survived (P < 0.01). Six of seven patients with a primary neurological problem survived (P < 0.001); these appear to represent a good outcome group. Age, the presence of graft-versus-host disease, the use of inotropes, isolated renal or hepatic impairment, and paediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score were not predictive of outcome.

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this article is to describe how a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was able to reduce substantially the use of postnatal dexamethasone in infants born between 501 and 1250 g while at the same time implementing a group of potentially better practices (PBPs) in an attempt to decrease the incidence and severity of chronic lung disease (CLD).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study was both a retrospective chart review and an ongoing multicenter evidence-based investigation associated with the Vermont Oxford Network Neonatal Intensive Care Quality Improvement Collaborative (NIC/Q 2000). The NICU specifically made the reduction of CLD and dexamethasone use a priority and thus formulated a list of PBPs that could improve clinical outcomes across 3 time periods: era 1, standard NICU care that antedated the quality improvement project; era 2, gradual implementation of the PBPs; and era 3, full implementation of the PBPs. All infants who had a birth weight between 501 and 1250 g and were admitted to the NICU during the 3 study eras were included (era 1, n = 134; era 2, n = 73; era 3, n = 83). As part of the NIC/Q 2000 process, the NICU implemented 3 primary PBPs to improve clinical outcomes related to pulmonary disease: 1) gentle, low tidal volume resuscitation and ventilation, permissive hypercarbia, increased use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure; 2) decreased use of postnatal dexamethasone; and 3) vitamin A administration. The total dexamethasone use, the incidence of CLD, and the mortality rate were the primary outcomes of interest. Secondary outcomes included the severity of CLD, total ventilator and nasal continuous positive airway pressure days, grades 3 and 4 intracranial hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, stages 3 and 4 retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, pneumothorax, length of stay, late-onset sepsis, and pneumonia.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The percentage of infants who received dexamethasone during their NICU admission decreased from 49% in era 1 to 22% in era 3. Of those who received dexamethasone, the median number of days of exposure dropped from 23.0 in era 1 to 6.5 in era 3. The median total NICU exposure to dexamethasone in infants who received at least 1 dose declined from 3.5 mg/kg in era 1 to 0.9 mg/kg in era 3. The overall amount of dexamethasone administered per total patient population decreased 85% from era 1 to era 3. CLD was seen in 22% of infants in era 1 and 28% in era 3, a nonsignificant increase. The severity of CLD did not significantly change across the 3 eras, neither did the mortality rate. We observed a significant reduction in the use of mechanical ventilation as well as a decline in the incidence of late-onset sepsis and pneumonia, with no other significant change in morbidities or length of stay.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Postnatal dexamethasone use in premature infants born between 501 and 1250 g can be sharply curtailed without a significant worsening in a broad range of clinical outcomes. Although a modest, nonsignificant trend was observed toward a greater number of infants needing supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, the severity of CLD did not increase, the mortality rate did not rise, length of stay did not increase, and other benefits such as decreased use of mechanical ventilation and fewer episodes of nosocomial infection were documented."

All animals were fluid resuscitated and observed until death.\n    \n\n\n          Measurements and main results:\n        \n      \n      In addition to hemodynamic measurements, we assessed the sublingual microcirculation, renal and cerebral microdialysis and microvascular perfusion, and brain tissue oxygen pressure. Hyperoxic animals initially had a higher mean arterial pressure than control animals. After onset of shock, hyperoxia blunted the decrease in stroke volume index observed in the control group. Hyperoxia was associated with a higher sublingual microcirculatory flow over time, with higher cerebral perfusion and brain tissue oxygen pressure and with a lower cerebral lactate-to-pyruvate ratio than in control animals. Hyperoxia was also associated with preserved renal microvascular perfusion, lower renal lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, and higher PaO2/FIO2 ratio.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this acute peritonitis model, hyperoxia induced during resuscitation provided better hemodynamics and peripheral microvascular flow and better preserved cerebral metabolism, renal function, and gas exchange. These observations are reassuring with recent concerns about excessive oxygen therapy in acute diseases."

Propofol sedation was performed successfully in all children (mean age, 10.2 years; range 0.7-17.4 years). Indications for sedation included orthopedic manipulation, incision and drainage of abscess, sexual assault examination, laceration repair, and non-invasive imaging studies. The mean dose administered with the intermittent bolus and continuous infusion methods of delivery was 4.25 mg/kg (+/- 1.86) and 8.3 mg/kg/h, respectively. The mean recovery time was 27.1 min (+/- 15.84). No patient required assisted ventilation or developed clinically significant hypotension.

Systematic reviews of many randomized controlled trials were published in an important textbook in 1992, 'Effective Care of the Newborn Infant', which was the starting point for the Neonatal Module of the Cochrane Collaboration. The 171 systematic reviews of interventions in neonatology published in the Cochrane Library provide evidence for neonatal care in many areas of the speciality. Some areas, such as management of respiratory distress with surfactant and assisted ventilation, are well covered by reviews, but others, such as resuscitation at birth and management of jaundice, are much less evidence based. Most of the systematic reviews deal with neonatal care in the developed world, and there are only a few of interest to carers in the developing world."

Anticipation of life-threatening events and required rescue measures is a critical component to preprocedural preparation. We sought to determine the incidence and nature of life-threatening adverse events in congenital and pediatric cardiac catheterization, risk factors, and resources necessary to anticipate and manage events. Data from 8905 cases performed at the 8 participating institutions of the Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Project on Outcomes were captured between 2007 and 2010 [median 1,095/site (range 133-3,802)]. The incidence of all life-threatening events was 2.1 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.8-2.4 %], whereas mortality was 0.28 % (95 % CI 0.18-0.41 %). Fifty-seven life-threatening events required cardiopulmonary resuscitation, whereas 9 % required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Use of a risk adjustment model showed that age <1 year [odd ratio (OR) 1.9, 95 % CI 1.4-2.7, p < 0.001], hemodynamic vulnerability (OR 1.6, 95 % CI 1.1-2.3, p < 0.01), and procedure risk (category 3: OR 2.3, 95 % CI 1.3-4.1; category 4: OR 4.2, 95 % CI 2.4-7.4) were predictors of life-threatening events. Using this model, standardized life-threatening event ratios were calculated, thus showing that one institution had a life-threatening event rate greater than expected. Congenital cardiac catheterization and intervention can be performed safely with a low rate of life-threatening events and mortality; preprocedural evaluation of risk may optimize preparation of emergency rescue and bailout procedures. Risk predictors (age < 1, hemodynamic vulnerability, and procedure risk category) can enhance preprocedural patient risk stratification and planning."

Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine that is used increasingly in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). However, its effectiveness as a sedative in neonates has not been systematically evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      Primary objeciveTo assess the effectiveness of intravenous midazolam infusion for sedation, as evaluated by behavioural and/or physiological measurements of sedation levels, in critically ill neonates in the NICU. Secondary objectivesTo assess effects of intravenous midazolam infusion for sedation on complications including the following.1. Incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH)/periventricular leukomalacia (PVL).2. Mortality.3. Occurrence of adverse effects associated with the use of midazolam (hypotension, neurological abnormalities).4. Days of ventilation.5. Days of supplemental oxygen.6. Incidence of pneumothorax.7.

Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We selected for review randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of intravenous midazolam infusion for sedation in infants aged 28 days or younger.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      We abstracted data regarding the primary outcome of level of sedation. We assessed secondary outcomes such as intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, death, length of NICU stay and adverse effects associated with midazolam. When appropriate, we performed meta-analyses using risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs), and if the RD was statistically significant, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or an additional harmful outcome (NNTH), along with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for categorical variables, and weighted mean differences (WMDs) for continuous variables. We assessed heterogeneity by performing the I-squared (I2) test.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included in the review three trials enrolling 148 neonates. We identified no new trials for this update. Using different sedation scales, each study showed a statistically significantly higher sedation level in the midazolam group compared with the placebo group. However, none of the sedation scales used have been validated in preterm infants; therefore, we could not ascertain the effectiveness of midazolam in this population. Duration of NICU stay was significantly longer in the midazolam group than in the placebo group (WMD 5.4 days, 95% CI 0.40 to 10.5; I2 = 0%; two studies, 89 infants). One study (43 infants) reported significantly lower Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) scores during midazolam infusion than during dextrose (placebo) infusion (MD -3.80, 95% CI -5.93 to -1.67). Another study (46 infants) observed a higher incidence of adverse neurological events at 28 days' postnatal age (death, grade III or IV IVH or PVL) in the midazolam group compared with the morphine group (RR 7.64, 95% CI 1.02 to 57.21; RD 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; NNTH 4, 95% CI 2 to 14) (tests for heterogeneity not applicable). We considered these trials to be of moderate quality according to GRADE assessment based on the following outcomes: mortality during hospital stay, length of NICU stay, adequacy of analgesia according to PIPP scores and poor neurological outcomes by 28 days' postnatal age.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Data are insufficient to promote the use of intravenous midazolam infusion as a sedative for neonates undergoing intensive care. This review raises concerns about the safety of midazolam in neonates. Further research on the effectiveness and safety of midazolam in neonates is needed."

Pre- and postparticipation questionnaires were used to determine the effects on the knowledge, ability, and confidence level of the participants. The participants were required to repeat the simulation test within 6-8 months. The study enrolled 26 providers (10 fellow physicians, 12 nurses and nurse practitioners, 4 respiratory therapists). All except one had no previous training in the management of ECMO. Of the 26 participants, 24 passed the initial written and practical tests. One participant failed the written test, whereas another failed the practical test. All the responding participants scored the didactic and scenarios education as useful, at 4 or higher (5 = very useful), in improving their perception of their overall knowledge and their ability to perform the required critical performance criteria on simulated ECMO.

All the children had tachycardia before CBP and the heart rate fell gradually to 45 +/- 13 bpm 4 h after CBP. Blood pressure (BP) was stable in 7 children without shock during CBP. Ten children with early shock could maintain normal BP during CBP, but the doses of vasoactive agents were tapered 1 to 5 h after beginning of CBP and use of these agents was discontinued at 2 to 8 h.

No guidelines on the use of NMBAs in pediatric patients are available yet in the United States; however, pediatric guidelines are available in the United Kingdom. Based on a 2007 U.S. survey, the most commonly used nondepolarizing NMBAs for sustained neuromuscular blockade in critically ill children are pancuronium and vecuronium. Recent national drug shortages involving NMBAs have been reported for atracurium, cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium, and vecuronium. Therefore, to explore alternative options for neuromuscular blockade, we conducted a literature search to identify articles evaluating prolonged use (> 24 hrs) of NMBAs administered by continuous infusion. The search was limited to English-language articles in the MEDLINE (1950-August 2010), EMBASE (1988-August 2010), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-August 2010), and Cochrane Library (1996-August 2010) databases.

Selection of the most appropriate NMBA should be based on the patient's clinical status, potential adverse effects, and pharmacoeconomics. All patients receiving sustained neuromuscular blockade should be monitored routinely to ensure that dosing is appropriate in order to obtain the desired level of blockade. The goal is to use the lowest dose possible in an effort to limit adverse effects or prolonged blockade."

            "title": "How to Administer Near-Infrared Spectroscopy in Critically ill Neonates, Infants, and Children.",
            "abstract": "Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) calculates regional tissue oxygenation (rSO2) using the different absorption spectra of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin molecules. A probe placed on the skin emits light that is absorbed, scattered, and reflected by the underlying tissue. Detectors in the probe sense the amount of reflected light: this reflects the organ-specific ratio of oxygen supply and consumption - independent of pulsatile flow. Modern devices enable the simultaneous monitoring at different body sites. A rise or dip in the rSO2 curve visualizes changes in oxygen supply or demand before vital signs indicate them. The evolution of rSO2 values in relation to the starting point is more important for interpretation than are absolute values. A routine clinical application of NIRS is the surveillance of somatic and cerebral oxygenation during and after cardiac surgery. It is also administered in preterm infants at risk for necrotizing enterocolitis, newborns with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and a potential risk of impaired tissue oxygenation. In the future, NIRS could be increasingly used in multimodal neuromonitoring, or applied to monitor patients with other conditions (e.g., after resuscitation or traumatic brain injury)."

            "abstract": "In severe cases of status asthmaticus, when conventional therapies fail, volatile anesthetic agents remain a therapeutic option. When delivered outside of the operating room setting, specialized delivery techniques are needed to ensure the safe and effective use of volatile anesthetic agents. We present a 16-year-old adolescent with status asthmaticus who required the therapeutic administration of the volatile anesthetic agent, sevoflurane, in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Although initially effective in reducing bronchospasm, progressive hypercarbia developed due to defective functioning of the carbon dioxide absorber of the anesthesia machine. This failure occurred as the soda lime compartment filled with water accumulated from circuit humidification and continuous albuterol therapy. The role of volatile anesthetic agents in the treatment of status asthmaticus in the PICU is discussed, options for delivery outside of the operating room presented, and potential problems with delivery reviewed."

No prospective data support its use in the paediatric emergency department (ED). We introduced HFNC therapy into a paediatric ED and evaluated its use and failure rates.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Prospective observational study of all patients presenting to the Royal Children's Hospital, Australia, who received HFNC therapy between April 2013 and September 2013 (one southern hemisphere winter season).

The median age was 9 months. The most common indication was bronchiolitis (49/71; 69%). Five (7%) of the patients failed HFNC and were escalated to other forms of respiratory support in ED, four to nasal continuous positive airway pressure and one required intubation. A further 21 (32%) failed HFNC therapy after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, giving a total failure of 28 (39%). There were no serious adverse events in ED, and one child with asthma developed air leak syndrome after transfer to the ICU.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      HFNC therapy may have a role in the paediatric ED as an easily administered and well tolerated form of non-invasive respiratory support, but about one-third of patients required escalation to a higher level of respiratory support. Further studies should assess the safety profile of HFNC in larger series, and define the role of HFNC in key respiratory conditions compared with other possible interventions."

There are insufficient data to support any specific age for \"adult\" acute respiratory distress syndrome compared with \"pediatric\" acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, children with perinatal-related respiratory failure should be excluded from the definition of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Larger departures from the Berlin Definition surround 1) simplification of chest imaging criteria to eliminate bilateral infiltrates; 2) use of pulse oximetry-based criteria when PaO2 is unavailable; 3) inclusion of oxygenation index and oxygen saturation index instead of PaO2/FIO2 ratio with a minimum positive end-expiratory pressure level for invasively ventilated patients; 4) and specific inclusion of children with preexisting chronic lung disease or cyanotic congenital heart disease.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This pediatric-specific definition for acute respiratory distress syndrome builds on the adult-based Berlin Definition, but has been modified to account for differences between adults and children with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We propose using this definition for future investigations and clinical care of children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and encourage external validation with the hope for continued iterative refinement of the definition."

To date, observational investigations have failed to calculate tidal volume based on standardized corrections of weight.

At 24 hours, there remained 400 patients on conventional ventilation. When calculating tidal volume based on ideal body weight by either method, volumes were larger both at onset and at 24 hours compared with tidal volume based on actual body weight (all p < 0.001), and the proportion of patients being ventilated with tidal volumes greater than 10 mL/kg based on ideal body weight was larger both at onset (12.4% and 15.5%) and 24 hours (10.3% and 11.5%) compared with actual body weight at onset (3.5%) and 24 hours (4.0%) (all p < 0.001). Tidal volume, based on both actual body weight and ideal body weight, was not associated with either increased mortality or decreased probability of extubation after adjusting for oxygenation index in the whole cohort, whereas associations between higher tidal volume and poor outcomes were seen in subgroup analyses in overweight children and in severe pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our retrospective analysis of a cohort of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome patients did not find a consistent association between tidal volume adjusted for ideal body weight and outcomes, although an association may exist in certain subgroups. Although it remains to be shown in a prospective trial whether high volumes or pressures are injurious in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome, tidal volume is likely an imprecise parameter for titrating lung-protective ventilation."

The patients who received a platelet transfusion (platelet transfusions, n = 232) compared with those who did not receive platelets (no platelet transfusions, n = 9,427) were younger, had similar gender distribution, had a higher median Pediatric Risk of Mortality-3 score, and stayed longer in the PICU. Fifty percent of platelet transfusions were prescribed prophylactically for thrombocytopenia to patients without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.

In a multiple logistic regression analysis, the predicted probability of dying for platelet transfusion group compared with no platelet transfusion group depended on the median Pediatric Risk of Mortality-3 score. Patients who received platelet transfusion versus no platelet transfusion have increased odds of dying at lower median Pediatric Risk of Mortality-3 scores, but decreased odds of dying at higher median Pediatric Risk of Mortality-3 scores.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This PICU cohort demonstrates that the odds or predicted probability of dying change in patients who received platelet transfusions based on underlying disease severity measured by Pediatric Risk of Mortality-3 score compared with patients who did not receive platelet transfusions. A large, prospective trial is required to confirm this association and determine whether to consider underlying disease severity in estimating risks and benefits of prophylactic platelet transfusions in critically ill children."

It is often a mild disease and seldom results in paediatric intensive care (PICU) admission. In 2003, World Health Organization (WHO) coined the word SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in patients with severe acute respiratory symptoms (sars) for an outbreak of AP in Hong Kong due to a novel coronavirus. In 2012, another outbreak of coronavirus AP occurred in the Middle East. Confusing case definitions such as MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARI (severe acute respiratory infections) were coined. This paper aims to present a case of MP with sars, ARDS, pneumonia and pleural effusion during the MERS epidemics, and review the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We presented a case of MP with sars, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia and pleural effusion during the MERS epidemics, and performed a literature review on the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP requiring PICU care.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In early 2013, an 11-year-old girl presented with sars, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), right-sided pneumonia and pleural effusion. She was treated with multiple antibiotics. Streptococcus pneumoniae was not isolated in this girl with 'typical' pneumonia by symptomatology and chest radiography, but tracheal aspirate identified MP instead. The respiratory equations are computed with PaO2 /FiO2 consistent with severe lung injury. Literature on the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP requiring PICU care is reviewed. Six, 165 and 293 articles were found when PubMed (a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine) was searched for the terms 'mycoplasma' and 'ICU', 'mycoplasma' and 'mortality', and 'mycoplasma' and 'severe'. Mortality and PICU admission associated with MP is general low and rarely reported. Experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of lung injuries in MP infection is associated with a cell-mediated immune reaction, and high responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy has been reported especially for severe disease. Management of severe mycoplasma infection in the PICU includes general cardiopulmonary support and specific antimicrobial treatment. Macrolide resistance genotypes have been detected.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We urge health organizations to refrain from the temptation of coining unnecessary new terminology to describe essentially the same conditions each and every time when outbreaks of AP occur."

Patients who were admitted to the ICU for any alternate reason and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by screening test, and patients who were admitted due to multi-inflammatory syndrome in children, were excluded. Demographic, laboratory, imaging, and clinical data were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to compare survivors and non-survivors. Fine and Gray's hazard model was used to estimate the association between clinical variables and ICU death.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      During the study period, 25 pediatric COVID-19 patients received care in the ICUs. The median age was 2.78 years (IQR 0.21-8.51), and 60% were male. Only three patients were reported to be previously healthy at admission. Nine (36%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, including two were on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Four (16%) patients died during ICU care. In univariate analysis, the presence of comorbidity (HR 0.0001; 95%CI 0.00001-0.00016), platelets count (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98-0.99), elevated procalcitonin (HR 1.05; 95%CI 1.016-1.09), and circulatory compromise (HR 16.34; 95%CI 1.99-134.35), all at the time of ICU admission, were associated with in-ICU mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our findings suggest that children admitted to the ICU with SARS-CoV-2 infection, generally, have a favorable outcome. Low platelets count, elevated procalcitonin, presence of comorbidity, and shock at the time of ICU admission were associated with death. This study may shed more light on the disease dynamics of critical pediatric COVID-19."

The goal of critical care management is to stop these self-aggravating processes as soon as possible. Initial resuscitation is devoted to control of the airway and hemodynamic and hydroelectrolytic stabilization. With mass lesions, minimal computed tomographic exploration immediately precedes surgical decompression. Further critical care adapted to the child's needs requires multimodal monitoring. Normoventilation, deep sedation, osmotherapy with mannitol or hypertonic saline solutions, and optimization of mean arterial pressure are the basis of management. A purely pressure-driven approach aimed at controlling cerebral perfusion pressure could be potentially harmful, and associated measurement of blood flow velocity with transcranial Doppler and jugular bulb oxygen saturation monitoring allows an approach to cerebral blood flow and metabolism. Outcome can be improved in dangerous situations such as severe brain injuries, cerebral arteriovenous malformation rupture, status epilepticus, and acute hydrocephalus, provided that emergency management could be applied efficiently."

Three hypotheses were investigated: a) Extubation failure is in part disease specific; b) preexisting respiratory conditions predispose to extubation failure; and c) admission acuity scoring does not affect extubation failure.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      Twelve-month prospective, observational, clinical study.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Sixteen diverse PICUs in the United States.\n    \n\n\n          Patients:\n        \n      \n      Patients were 2,794 patients from the newborn period to 18 yrs of age experiencing a planned extubation trial.\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      None.\n    \n\n\n          Measurements and main results:\n        \n      \n      A descriptive statistical analysis was performed, and outcome differences of the failed extubation population were determined. The extubation failure rate was 6.2% (174 of 2,794; 95% confidence interval, 5.3-7.1). Patient features associated with extubation failure (p <.05) included age < or =24 months; dysgenetic condition; syndromic condition; chronic respiratory disorder; chronic neurologic condition; medical or surgical airway condition; chronic noninvasive positive pressure ventilation; the need to replace the endotracheal tube on admission to the PICU; and the use of racemic epinephrine, steroids, helium-oxygen therapy (heliox), or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation within 24 hrs of extubation. Patients failing extubation had longer pre-extubation intubation time (failed, 148.7 hrs, SD +/- 207.8 vs. success, 107.9 hrs, SD +/- 171.3; p <.001), longer PICU length of stay (17.5 days, SD +/- 15.6 vs. 7.6 days, SD +/- 11.1; p <.001), and a higher mortality rate than patients not failing extubation (4.0% vs. 0.8%; p <.001). Failure was found to be in part disease specific, and preexisting respiratory conditions were found to predispose to failure whereas admission acuity did not.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      A variety of patient features are associated with an increase in extubation failure rate, and serious outcome consequences characterize the extubation failure population in PICUs."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      The management of hypoxemia in critically ill patients is challenging. Whilst the harms of tissue hypoxia are well recognized, the possibility of harm from excess oxygen administration, or other interventions targeted at mitigating hypoxemia, may be inadequately appreciated. The benefits of attempting to fully reverse arterial hypoxemia may be outweighed by the harms associated with high concentrations of supplemental oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation strategies. We propose two novel related strategies for the management of hypoxemia in critically ill patients. First, we describe precise control of arterial oxygenation involving the specific targeting of arterial partial pressure of oxygen or arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation to individualized target values, with the avoidance of significant variation from these levels. The aim of precise control of arterial oxygenation is to avoid the harms associated with inadvertent hyperoxia or hypoxia through careful and precise control of arterial oxygen levels. Secondly, we describe permissive hypoxemia: the acceptance of levels of arterial oxygenation lower than is conventionally tolerated in patients. The aim of permissive hypoxemia is to minimize the possible harms caused by restoration of normoxemia while avoiding tissue hypoxia. This review sets out to discuss the strengths and limitations of precise control of arterial oxygenation and permissive hypoxemia as candidate management strategies in hypoxemic critically ill patients.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      We searched PubMed for references to \"permissive hypoxemia/hypoxaemia\" and \"precise control of arterial oxygenation\" as well as reference to \"profound hypoxemia/hypoxaemia/hypoxia,\" \"severe hypoxemia/hypoxaemia/hypoxia.\" We searched personal reference libraries in the areas of critical illness and high altitude physiology and medicine. We also identified large clinical studies in patients with critical illness characterized by hypoxemia such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n    \n\n\n          Subjects:\n        \n      \n      Studies were selected that explored the physiology of hypoxemia in healthy volunteers or critically ill patients.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      The data were subjectively assessed and combined to generate the narrative.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Inadequate tissue oxygenation and excessive oxygen administration can be detrimental to outcome but safety thresholds lack definition in critically ill patients. Precise control of arterial oxygenation provides a rational approach to the management of arterial oxygenation that reflects recent clinical developments in other settings. Permissive hypoxemia is a concept that is untested clinically and requires robust investigation prior to consideration of implementation. Both strategies will require accurate monitoring of oxygen administration and arterial oxygenation. Effective, reliable measurement of tissue oxygenation along with the use of selected biomarkers to identify suitable candidates and monitor harm will aid the development of permissive hypoxemia as viable clinical strategy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Implementation of precise control of arterial oxygenation may avoid the harms associated with excessive and inadequate oxygenation. However, at present there is no direct evidence to support the immediate implementation of permissive hypoxemia and a comprehensive evaluation of its value in critically ill patients should be a high research priority."

PO2, PCO2 and pH (hydrogen ion concentration) were measured continuously via a femoral arterial sensor and compared with 100 simultaneous paired arterial blood-gas measurements. Data were analysed by Bland-Altman analysis for bias and precision. Sensors were placed in 10 children of median age 5.43 (range 0.03-45) months, median weight 3.74 (2.79-15.4) kg and remained in place for up to 27 h after operation. PO2 values were 2.5-8.2 kPa (median 5.3 kPa). Co-oximeter saturation ranged from 37.1% to 90.6% (median 75.8%). Bias and precision values were 0.04/0.87 kPa for PO2, -0.44/0.74 kPa for PCO2 and -2.61/6.98 nmol litre-1 for hydrogen ion concentration (i.e. 0.02/0.06 for pH). We conclude that perioperative continuous arterial gas monitoring is clinically accurate under conditions of severe hypoxaemia in small infants and children with cyanotic congenital heart disease."

            "abstract": "Independent lung ventilation is an infrequently used ventilation strategy in the pediatric intensive care unit but can be beneficial in unique patient subsets, such as patients who have asymmetric pulmonary pathology. Independent lung ventilation allows for the independent delivery of the appropriate effective tidal volume to each lung on the basis of individual compliance and pathology. In theory, it may help avoid alveolar overdistension and ventilator-induced lung injury in the nondiseased lung. In addition, it allows for targeted interventions. Here, we describe a child with unilateral lung disease requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation who rapidly improved, allowing decannulation within 24 hours, after the application of independent lung ventilation and unilateral surfactant administration."

            "abstract": "The management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) has advanced because of improvements in mechanical ventilators, promotion of antenatal steroids, availability of surfactant and overall advancements in neonatal intensive care. Intermittent mandatory ventilation still forms the mainstay of assisted ventilation. Newer modes of ventilation have not delivered the results as promised. Because of the continued high incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, there is a renewed interest in non-invasive modes of ventilation like CPAP and nasal IPPV. The present trend is to follow gentle ventilatory strategies accepting higher arterial carbon dioxide and lower oxygen. The role of antenatal steroids has been established beyond doubt but still they fall short of universal acceptance. Surfactant replacement therapy is the standard of care for RDS but beyond the reach of majority in India. Postnatal steroids are out of vogue because of probable links with cerebral palsy and abnormal neurological outcomes."

            "abstract": "Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a pulmonary vasodilator that recruits blood flow to well-ventilated lung areas in the presence of lung disease. iNO may improve oxygenation by decreasing intrapulmonary shunt or may worsen oxygenation by reversing hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, therapy increasing ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Recent studies have examined the mechanisms for gas exchange alterations with iNO. Moreover, several randomized controlled trials have explored the magnitude of the effect on oxygenation and the beneficial influence on clinical outcome in neonatal patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. It is not known to what extent an increase in oxygenation affects clinical outcome in older patients. The potential benefit of iNO therapy must be weighed against the potential risks of inactivating surfactant and platelet function as well as influencing endogenous pulmonary vasoregulation. Well-designed studies will be important to determine whether the improvement in oxygenation outweighs these as well as unknown risks."

The primary outcome is unplanned transfer to the paediatric intensive care unit or transfer from regional hospitals to the university hospital. Based on preliminary data, 14,000 children should be included to gain a power of 80% (with a 5% significance level) and to detect a clinically significant difference of 30% of unplanned transfers to intensive care or from regional hospitals to the paediatric department at the university department. A safety interim analysis will be performed after inclusion of 7000 patients.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This is the first randomised trial to investigate two different PEWS models. This study demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of a new PEWS model and contributes to knowledge of hospitalised children's clinical deterioration.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02433327 .

The patient has bronchopulomonary dysplasia, severe restrictive lung disease and thoracic insufficiency from skeletal dysplasia requiring tracheostomy tube (TT) at two-month-old and mechanical ventilation. The 3.5 NEO TT was gradually upsized to a 5. The PEEP setting at transfer was 18cmH2O. The direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy showed moderate tracheomalacia at the innominate artery with a false pouch in the posterior tracheal wall that was 1.1cm below the tracheostomy stoma. A multi-disciplinary discussion including otolaryngology, PICU, Pulmonary Medicine, and Pediatric Surgery decided on conservative management. The false pouch healed and she was transferred back to referring PICU after a 46-day.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Tracheal wall erosion resulting in a pouch formation is a rare complication, but it should be considered in patients with long term tracheostomy with difficulty ventilation and oxygenation with positional change.

To develop clinically useful ECMO entry criteria based on parameters readily available, children were examined at postoperative pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. Using hospital mortality as the primary outcome, univariate and multiple logistic regressions were performed to estimate the predictive value of clinical (age, weight, and diagnosis) and laboratory (arterial blood pressure, pH, lactate, creatine kinase, and arterial and central venous oxygen saturation [ScvO2]) variables. Data from 218 children over a 2 year period were analyzed retrospectively. Univariate regression demonstrated that age, weight, diagnosis, blood pressure, venous and arterial saturation, and lactate were significantly associated with postoperative mortality (p < 0.05). In multiple regression, ScvO2 and lactate level were found to be independent predictors and were used in a predictive model (ScvO2 odds ratio: 2.03-828.6, p = 0.016) (lactate odds ratio: 1.58 -4.20, p = 0.0002) (R2 = 0.70). Applying an 80% risk of mortality to establish entry criteria as in neonatal ECMO, PICU admission values of lactate > 70 mg/dl if ScvO2 < 60% or lactate >163 mg/dl if ScvO2 > 60% are proposed to serve as postoperative ECMO entry criteria if bypass weaning has been possible but is followed by low cardiac output."

The median meningococcal score was 4 and the median PRISM score was 20, with scores above these being significantly associated with death (P < 0.0001). Thirty-two children (91%) received infusions of colloid for hypovolaemia and twenty-nine (83%) received one or more inotropic drugs. Twenty-one children (60%) required mechanical ventilation for a median of 16.5 h (range 7-574). Seven children (20%) underwent plasmapheresis. Six children (17%) underwent haemofiltration and two (6%), peritoneal dialysis. One patient received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) because of circulatory failure. Twenty-one children (60%) developed disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure and/or skin or limb necrosis.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has emerged as a promising intervention that may provide more efficacious supportive care to these patients. Improvements in technology have made ECMO safer and easier to use, allowing for the potential of more widespread application in patients with ARF. A greater appreciation of the complications associated with the placement of an artificial airway and mechanical ventilation has led clinicians and researchers to seek viable alternatives to providing supportive care in these patients. Thus, this review will summarize the current knowledge regarding the use of venovenous (VV)-ECMO for ARF and describe some of the recent controversies in the field, such as mechanical ventilation, anticoagulation and transfusion therapy, and ethical concerns in patients supported with VV-ECMO."

Telemedicine has been shown to reliably extend pediatric intensivist expertise to facilities where expertise is limited. If reliable, telemedicine may extend the reach of pediatric respiratory therapists (RTs) to facilities where expertise does not exist or free up existing RT resources for important face-to-face activities in facilities where expertise is limited. The aim of this study was to determine how well respiratory assessments for ventilated neonates and children correlated when performed simultaneously by 2 RTs face-to-face and via telemedicine.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a pilot study including 40 assessments by 16 RTs on 11 subjects (5 neonatal ICU; 6 pediatric ICU).

For example, morbidity and mortality could be mitigated by a proactive regional plan for the triage of mechanical ventilators. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a resource-intensive and potentially life-saving modality in severe respiratory failure, has generally not been included in proactive disaster preparedness until recently. This paper explores underlying assumptions and triage principles that could guide the integration of ECMO resources into existing disaster planning. Drawing from a collaborative framework developed by one US metropolitan area with multiple adult and pediatric extracorporeal life support centers, this paper aims to inform decision-making around ECMO use during a pandemic such as COVID-19. It also addresses the ethical and practical aspects of not continuing to offer ECMO during a disaster."

            "abstract": "In neonates, cardiovascular system development does not stop after the transition from intra-uterine to extra-uterine life and is not limited to the macrocirculation. The microcirculation (MC), which is essential for oxygen, nutrient, and drug delivery to tissues and cells, also develops. Developmental changes in the microcirculatory structure continue to occur during the initial weeks of life in healthy neonates. The physiologic hallmarks of neonates and developing children make them particularly vulnerable during critical illness; however, the cardiovascular monitoring possibilities are limited compared with critically ill adult patients. Therefore, the development of non-invasive methods for monitoring the MC is necessary in pediatric critical care for early identification of impending deterioration and to enable the initiation and titration of therapy to ensure cell survival. To date, the MC may be non-invasively monitored at the bedside using hand-held videomicroscopy, which provides useful information regarding the microcirculation. There is an increasing number of studies on the MC in neonates and pediatric patients; however, additional steps are necessary to transition MC monitoring from bench to bedside. The recently introduced concept of hemodynamic coherence describes the relationship between changes in the MC and macrocirculation. The loss of hemodynamic coherence may result in a depressed MC despite an improvement in the macrocirculation, which represents a condition associated with adverse outcomes. In the pediatric intensive care unit, the concept of hemodynamic coherence may function as a framework to develop microcirculatory measurements towards implementation in daily clinical practice."

            "abstract": "Critically-ill patients are at risk of developing renal disorders as a consequence of systemic hypoperfusion. Ischemic acute tubular necrosis and resulting acute renal failure are caused by hypotension or therapeutic management. In this study, we tested the change of O(2) availability induced by fenoldopam mesylate using the continuous measurement of urinary oxygen tension (PuO(2)), a relatively noninvasive technique that could provide potentially important real-time data regarding renal oxygenation in intensive care unit patients. Fenoldopam was administered at different doses (0.03, 0.06, and 0.09 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) to 50 stable critically-ill patients. Urine output was collected every hour to assess volume and urinary electrolytes. Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, arterial oxygen delivery index, and oxygen consumption index were analyzed after fenoldopam dose modifications and at infusion end. PaO(2) and PuO(2) continuous measurements were obtained through two sensors inserted in the radial artery and in the bladder. After a fenoldopam dose increase, PuO(2) significantly increased (P < 0.05), whereas PaO(2) remained unchanged. During the study, heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, arterial oxygen delivery index, and oxygen consumption remained unchanged. Dose-dependent PuO(2) increases, unrelated to indexes of systemic perfusion and cardiac function, demonstrate that fenoldopam affects the balance between renal oxygen supply and demand in stable critically-ill patients.\n    \n\n\n          Implications:\n        \n      \n      Acute renal failure in critically-ill patients is associated with frequent mortality. Prolonged renal hypoperfusion cannot be detected by current systemic hemodynamic indexes.

However, the sensitivity and specificity of tc-PO2 and tc-PCO2 were similar with regard to maintaining aB-PO2 and aB-PCO2 within specified limits. Tc-PCO2 increased relatively with increasing electrode temperature by a factor which was similar to the anaerobic temperature coefficient of PCO2 in blood. The coefficient of variation of duplicate measurements was 10% for tc-PO2 and 5% for tc-PCO2.

Specific patient, clinician, and practice factors are associated with these occurrences. In both the operating room and other clinical areas, use of passive oxygenation will provide additional laryngoscopy time. The use of neuromuscular blockade was thought to be contraindicated in difficult airway patients. Newer evidence from observational studies showed that controlled ventilation with or without neuromuscular blockade is associated with fewer adverse events in the operating room. Similarly, a multicenter neonatal intensive care unit study showed fewer adverse events in infants who received neuromuscular blockade. Neuromuscular blockade should be avoided in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis, head and neck radiation, airway masses, and external airway compression for anticipated worsening airway collapse with neuromuscular blocker administration.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Clinicians caring for children with difficult airways should consider new cognitive paradigms and concepts, leverage the strengths of multiple devices, and consider the role of alternate anesthetic approaches such as controlled ventilation and use of neuromuscular blocking drugs in select situations. Anesthesiologists can partner with intensive care and emergency department and neonatology clinicians to improve the safety of airway management in all clinical settings."

She was hypotensive and required a glucagon and epinephrine infusion despite initial fluid resuscitation with saline and intravenous calcium (1 g). Multiple asystolic cardiac arrests ensued which became increasingly refractory to high-dose epinephrine. Hemodynamic support was achieved with a 48-hr period of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for atrial standstill. Severe multiorgan dysfunction ensued (cardiac, neurologic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, hematologic, and metabolic). Plasma diltiazem and its metabolites were measured and its half-life was reported between 28 and 48 hrs. A sustained decline in plasma diltiazem levels and its metabolites was not observed after two periods of charcoal hemoperfusion.

The aims of this study are the following: (1) to describe the demographical and clinical characteristics and respiratory management of these children; and (2) to identify the factors associated with mechanical ventilation (MV) and mortality. A total of 69 patients, encompassing 88 episodes, were included (55/88 cases were hypoxemic RF). The first respiratory support at PICU admission was, in decreasing order of frequency, high-flow oxygen nasal cannula (HFNC; 50/88), noninvasive ventilation (NIV; 13/88), and oxygen nasal cannula (16/88). MV was necessary in 47/88 episodes, 38/47 after another respiratory support. In 18/28 children with initial NIV, MV was required later. MV was associated with O-PRISM score, NIV requirement, suspected respiratory infection, and days of PICU treatment. Patients without MV showed an increased survival rate (P=0.001). In summary, the hypoxemic RF was the main cause of PICU admission, and HFNC or NIV was almost always the first respiratory support. The use of MV was associated with a higher mortality rate. The utility of precocious HFNC or NIV should be investigated in larger clinical studies."

In 40 critically ill children (112 data sets) with a mean age of 3.9 years (range 1 day to 19 years), SaO2 ranged from 57% to 100%, and PaO2 from 27 to 128 mm Hg, heart rates from 85 to 210 beats per minute, hematocrit from 20% to 67%, and fetal hemoglobin levels from 1.3% to 60%; peripheral temperatures varied between 26.5 degrees and 36.5 degrees C. Linear correlation analysis revealed a good agreement between simultaneous pulse oximeter values and both directly measured SaO2 (r = 0.95) and that calculated from measured arterial PaO2 (r = 0.95). The device detected several otherwise unrecognized drops in SaO2 but failed to function in four patients with poor peripheral perfusion secondary to low cardiac output. Simultaneous measurements with a tcPO2 electrode showed a similarly good correlation with PaO22 (r = 0.91), but the differences between the two measurements were much wider (mean 7.1 +/- 10.3 mm Hg, range -14 to +49 mm Hg) than the differences between pulse oximeter SaO2 and measured SaO2 (1.5% +/- 3.5%, range -7.5% to -9%) and were not predictable. We conclude that pulse oximetry is a reliable and accurate noninvasive device for measuring saturation, which because of its rapid response time may be an important advance in monitoring changes in oxygenation and guiding oxygen therapy."

            "abstract": "One of the most important aspects of caring for a critically ill patient is monitoring. Few would disagree that the most essential aspect of monitoring is frequent physical assessments. Complementing the physical examination is continuous monitoring of heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen saturation measured via pulse-oximetry, which have become the standard of care in intensive care units. Over the past decade one of the most controversial aspects of monitoring critically ill patients has been capnography. Although most clinicians use capnography to confirm endotracheal intubation, few clinicians use continuous capnography in the intensive care unit. This article reviews the medical literature on whether every mechanically ventilated patient should be monitored with capnography from intubation to extubation. There are numerous articles on capnography, but no definitive, randomized study has even attempted to address this specific question. Based on the available literature, it seems reasonable to use continuous capnography, for at least a subset of critically ill patients, to ensure integrity of the endotracheal tube and other ventilatory apparatus. However, at this point definitive data are not yet available to clearly support continuous capnography for optimizing mechanical ventilatory support. We hope that as new data become available, the answer to this capnography question will become clear."

Eighty-four percent of patients (n = 21) were categorized as overall responders to prone positioning because they experienced more days of increases of >/= 20 mm Hg in PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio or a decrease of >/= 10% in oxygenation index when shifted from a supine to a prone position during the study period. During the 107 patient-days and 214 positioning cycles, no critical incidents occurred. Furthermore, no patient experienced a persistent decrease in oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) of > 10% from values obtained when in the supine position, failed to keep their SpO(2) at > 85%, or experienced an increased respiratory rate of > 40 breaths/min when prone. Using the COMFORT score, patients were objectively rated to be equally comfortable in both the supine and prone positions. Patients also were able to resume spontaneous ventilation and to progress toward endotracheal extubation while in the prone position. Iatrogenic injury associated with prolonged prone positioning included stage II pressure ulcers in six patients (24%).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The pediatric patients in this series demonstrated improvements in oxygenation without serious iatrogenic injury after prone positioning. This study provides a foundation for a prospective randomized study investigating the effect of early and repeated prone positioning on clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with ALI."

            "abstract": "Few data exist regarding resuscitation of hypovolemic shock in infants, and alternative strategies such as vasopressor therapy merit further evaluation. However, the effects of norepinephrine on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation during hemorrhagic shock in the pediatric population are still unclear. Eight anesthetized piglets were subjected to hypotension by blood withdrawal of 25 mL/kg. Norepinephrine was titrated to achieve baseline mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and cerebral oxygenation was determined by brain tissue Po2 (Ptio2) and near-infrared spectroscopy-derived tissue oxygen index (TOI). Then, norepinephrine was stopped, MAP was allowed to decrease again below 30 mm Hg, and shed blood was retransfused. During hemorrhage, TOI dropped from 69+/-3 to 59+/-3%, and Ptio2 from 29+/-6 to 13+/-1 mm Hg (mean+/-SEM; p<0.001). Following norepinephrine, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) could be restored immediately, whereas TOI and Ptio2 did not increase significantly. In contrast, following retransfusion, TOI and Ptio2 increased to 68+/-3% and 27+/-7 mm Hg reaching baseline values, respectively. In conclusion, while norepinephrine increased CPP immediately, cerebral oxygenation as reflected by TOI and Ptio2 could not be improved by norepinephrine, but only by retransfusion."

            "abstract": "Critically ill children in pediatric intensive care units are commonly indicated for blood transfusion due to many reasons. Children are quite different from adults during growth and development, and that should be taken into consideration. It is very difficult to establish a universal transfusion guideline for critically ill children, especially preterm neonates. Treating underlying disease and targeted replacement therapy are the most effective approaches. Red blood cells are the first choice for replacement therapy in decompensated anemic patients. The critical hemoglobin concentration may be higher in critically ill children for many reasons. Whole blood is used only in the following conditions or diseases: (1) exchange transfusion; (2) after cardiopulmonary bypass; (3) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; (4) massive transfusion, especially in multiple component deficiency. The characteristics of hemorrhagic diseases are so varied that their therapy should depend on the specific needs associated with the underlying disease. In general, platelet transfusion is not needed when a patient has platelet count greater than 10,000/mm3 and is without active bleeding, platelet functional deficiency or other risk factors such as sepsis. Patients with risk factors or age less than 4 months should be taken into special consideration, and the critical thrombocyte level will be raised. Platelet transfusion is not recommended in patients with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopenia due to acceleration of platelet destruction without active bleeding or life-threatening hemorrhage. There are many kinds of plasma-derived products, and recombinant factors are commonly used for hemorrhagic patients due to coagulation factor deficiency depending on the characteristics of the diseases. The most effective way to correct disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is to treat the underlying disease. Anticoagulant therapy is very important; heparin is the most common agent used for DIC but the results are usually not satisfactory. Antithrombin III, protein C, or recombinant thrombomodulin has been used successfully to treat this condition. For reducing the risk of organism transmission and adverse reactions resulting from blood transfusion, the following measures have been suggested: (1) replacement therapy using products other than blood (e.g., erythropoietin, iron preparation, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor); (2) special component replacement therapy for specific diseases; (3) autotransfusion; (4) subdividing whole packed blood products into smaller volumes to reduce donor exposure; (5) advances in virus-inactivating procedures. To avoid viral transmission, vapor-heated or pasteurized products and genetic recombinant products are recommended. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seronegative blood, leukoreduced and/or irradiated blood are recommended for prevention of CMV infection, graft-versus-host-disease and alloimmunization in neonate and immunocompromised patient transfusion. There is no reason to prescribe a plasma product for nutritional supplementation because of the risk of complications. The principle: complications of transfusion must be avoided, the rate of blood exposure should be reduced and the safety of the transfused agents or components should be maintained must always be kept in mind."

Median preextracorporeal membrane oxygenation index was 66.9 (interquartile range, 50-85.6). Major comorbidities were present in 50% of patients. All patients were cannulated percutaneously. In two cases cannulation occurred from the left internal jugular vein. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was effective in increasing pH, arterial oxygen saturation, PaO2, and lowering PaCO2. The overall differences in pre and postextracorporeal membrane oxygenation values were statistically significant, while stratifying patients according to the cannula diameter (mm)/major diameter of the cannulated internal jugular vein (mm) ratio (> 0.67 or ≤ 0.67), statistical significance was reached only for the highest ratio. Complications were observed in three runs: two cannula tip dislocations in the right atrium and one limited flow in the only case in which an Avalon cannula was not used.

The investigation used a one group pretest-post-test study design and was performed in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit in a university-affiliated children's hospital. Nine infants were enrolled immediately after repair of tetralogy of Fallot (2) or atrioventricular septal defects (7) with mean weight = 5.5 kg (4.2-7.3 kg). Children were admitted to the pediatric cardiothoracic intensive care unit after complete surgical repair of their cardiac defect and stabilized on a Siemen's Servo 300 ventilator in volume control mode (VCV1) (volume-targeted ventilation with a square flow wave pattern). Tidal volume was set at 15 cc/kg (total). Hemodynamic parameters, airway pressures and ventilator settings, and an arterial blood gas were measured. Patients were then changed to pressure-regulated volume control mode (PRVC) (volume-targeted ventilation with decelerating flow wave pattern) with the tidal volume set as before. Measurements were repeated after 30 minutes. Patients were then returned to volume control mode (VCV2) and final measurements made after 30 minutes. The measurements and results are as follows: After correction of congenital heart defects in infants, mechanical ventilation using a decelerating flow wave pattern resulted in a 19% decrease in peak inspiratory pressure without affecting hemodynamics, arterial oxygenation, or carbon dioxide removal."

This system uses signals from the oximeter alone and a validation algorithm that is based in a computer connected to the oximeter. Unlike other validation systems, this system does not require connections to other monitors. The system was tested on 10 acutely ill newborns in an intensive care nursery over 16 hr of continuous recording for each infant (birthweight, 2.50 +/- 0.73 kg; age, 3.4 +/- 3.2 days). Oximetry data were accepted as valid using the new system if they surpassed a minimum level of quality (empirically derived, and equal to a 60% fractional success in pulse detection). The validated oximetry data were compared to data obtained using a conventional \"compared to the electrocardiogram (ECG)\" algorithm. For the new and the conventional algorithms, the distributions of validated SpO2 percents were nearly identical, with data rejection rates of 28.9% for the new system and 37.3% for the conventional system. In the newborns, the new system was used to demonstrate that as the mean saturations decreased, there were striking increases in variability about the reported mean saturation (p < 0.001). While variability in infant SpO2 is a well-known phenomenon, the amount seen here was unexpected. For example, the range of true saturations frequently recorded was quite wide at a reported mean SpO2 of 90% (from 81 to 94%; but, the range was only from 92 to 98% at a mean SpO2 of 96%). These findings demonstrate the usefulness of the new system and, if substantiated in more detailed studies, have important implications for the use of pulse oximeters to assess oxygenation in newborns."

Randomized controlled trials published in English, reporting studies on adult patients treated in an intensive care unit, emergency department or equivalent level of care were included. Interventions had to be protocolized and based on results from hemodynamic measurements, defined as cardiac output, stroke volume, stroke volume variation, oxygen delivery, and central venous-or mixed venous oxygenation. The control group had to be treated without any structured intervention based on the parameters mentioned above, however, monitoring by central venous pressure measurements was allowed. Out of 998 screened papers, thirteen met the inclusion criteria. A total of 3323 patients were enrolled in the six trials with low risk of bias (ROB).

We found no statistically significant reduction in mortality from hemodynamic optimization using hemodynamic monitoring in combination with a structured algorithm.

Among different treatments proposed, exogenous surfactant showed conflicting results. Aim of this multicenter retrospective observational study was to evaluate whether poractant alfa use in pediatric ARDS might improve gas exchange in children less than 2 years old, according to a shared protocol.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study was carried out in fourteen Italian PICUs after dissemination of a standardized protocol for surfactant administration within the Italian PICU network. The protocol provides the administration of surfactant (50 mg/kg) divided in two doses: the first dose is used as a bronchoalveolar lavage while the second as supplementation. Blood gas exchange variations before and after surfactant use were recorded.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Sixty-nine children, age 0-24 months, affected by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome treated with exogenous porcine surfactant were enrolled. Data collection consisted of patient demographics, respiratory variables and arterial blood gas analysis. The most frequent reasons for PICU admission were acute respiratory failure, mainly bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and septic shock. Fifty-four children (78.3%) had severe ARDS (define by oxygen arterial pressure and inspired oxygen fraction ratio (P/F) < 100), 15 (21.7%) had moderate ARDS (100 < P/F < 200). PO2, P/F, Oxygenation Index (OI) and pH showed a significant improvement after surfactant use with respect to baseline (p < 0.001 at each included time-point for each parameter). No significant difference in blood gas variations were observed among four different subgroups of diseases (bronchiolitis, pneumonia, septic shock and others). Overall, 11 children died (15.9%) and among these, 10 (90.9%) had complex chronic conditions. Two children (18.2%) died while being treated with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Mortality for severe pARDS was 20.4%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The use of porcine Surfactant improves oxygenation, P/F ratio, OI and pH in a population of children with moderate or severe pARDS caused by multiple diseases. A shared protocol seems to be a good option to obtain the same criteria of enrollment among different PICUs and define a unique way of use and administration of the drug for future studies."

            "abstract": "Closed-circuit spirometry techniques were used to study gas exchange (oxygen and carbon dioxide transport) across the native lung and membrane lung in ten neonates treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Initially there was negligible oxygen transport across the native lung (0.4 +/- 0.4 mL/kg/min). An increase in native lung oxygen transport (2.0 +/- 1.5 mL/kg/min) at low ventilator settings and high levels of extracorporeal support heralded recovery of the native lung and predicted weaning from ECMO. Measurement of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production permitted the energy expenditure to be calculated in these critically ill neonates. The metabolic rates varied widely in each neonate over time and among neonates. (mean 57 +/- 11 kcal/kg/d, range 38 to 80 kcal/kg/d). This emphasizes the need to determine energy expenditure in order to guide nutritional support."

The occurrence of persistent airleak during ECMO was significantly greater in nonsurvivors than in survivors. Furthermore, nonsurvivors had significantly less response to lung reexpansion maneuvers compared with survivors, as measured by a calculated compliance index (effective tidal volume/mean airway pressure x 100).

We tested the M-COVX metabolic monitor in the laboratory comparing its measurement to a traditional Haldane transformation across a wide range of oxygen consumption values, from 50 ml/minute to just under 300 ml/minute, typical of those expected in anaesthetised adults and children. The M-COVX device showed acceptable accuracy with an overall mean bias of -3.3% (range -15.1 to +4.2%, P = 0.21). Excellent linearity was found, by y = 0.96x + 0.5 ml/minute, r = 0.99.

All patients survived to hospital discharge.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Underlying chronic illness (especially respiratory illness) seems associated with critical novel H1N1 influenza disease in children. Respiratory manifestations are highly variable among patients and within a single patient involving both bronchoconstriction and alveolar disease. Therapies must be individualized and rapidly adjusted. The duration of critical illness was not different between early and late treatment groups. Whether this is reflective of sample size or indicative of the importance of therapeutic intervention at any time early during infection in critically ill patients is unclear. Bacterial superinfection was more common than previously reported for seasonal influenza A. Moderate novel H1N1 influenza disease, including respiratory failure and hypotension, had 100% survival in our series."

The Pediatric Risk of Admission (PRISA) score was developed in a single hospital and was recalibrated and validated in 2, previous, small studies from academic pediatric hospitals. This study was performed to develop and validate a score in a larger sample of diverse hospitals.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Emergency departments (EDs) were block randomly selected as part of a study on ED quality on the basis of 3 care characteristics: annual patient volume (high or low compared with national median), presence or absence of a pediatric emergency medicine subspecialist, and presence or absence of residents. Patients were selected randomly on the basis of daily arrival logs. Medical records were photocopied, and abstracted data included demographic, historical, physiologic, and therapeutic information. The total sample was randomly divided into a 75% development sample and a 25% validation sample. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to model the risk of mandatory admission, admissions for which preidentified, inpatient medical resources were used. The resulting multiple logistic regression model coefficients were converted to integer scores. Calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit) and discrimination (area under the ROC curve) were used to measure performance. As a measure of construct validity, proportions of patients in ordered risk intervals were correlated with the outcomes of admission, mandatory admission, and ICU admission.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Sixteen EDs enrolled 11664 patients. Mean patient age (+/-SD) was 6.8 +/- 5.8 years, and 53% were male. Nine percent arrived by emergency medical services, and 6.9% were admitted. The most common diagnoses were minor injuries, otitis media, and fever. The multivariate analysis yielded a score with 7 historical variables, 8 physiologic variables, 1 therapy (oxygen) term, and 1 interaction term. Calibration was excellent. In the development sample, 442 mandatory admissions were predicted and 442 were observed (total chi2 = 2.275), and in the validation sample, 136.6 were predicted and 145 were observed (chi2 = 8.575).

Method: The clinical and laboratory data of 11 children with SAP who were admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of Shanghai Children's Hospital from June 2013 to May 2016 were analyzed, including using pediatric critical illness score (PCIS) and pediatric risk of score mortality (PRISM)-Ⅲ score to assessing the severity of the disease.For those patients with severe organ dysfunction, CBP treatment was used when conventional therapy was not efficient.The evolution and prognosis of the disease were observed and analyzed.The measurement data were analyzed by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Result: From June 2013 to May 2016, 11 cases with SAP were treated in PICU, of whom 7 cases had combined multiple organ dysfunction syndrome(MODS). After conservative treatment for 12-24 h, 6 cases with SAP deteriorated aggressively and were treated with CBP.PRISMA and PRISMA flex machines were used with Gambro PRISMA filter, and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration(CVVHDF) or high volume hemofiltration (HVHF) were chosen as the therapy model.All 6 SAP patients survived after bedside CBP treatment(the median time spent on CBP were 48.5(48.0, 55.5) h). The serum concentration of amylase before and after the CBP treatment were respectively 675(495, 1 334)vs.176(136, 246) U/L, lipase 551(385, 1 075)vs.143(117, 185) U/L, CRP 168(125, 192) vs. 67(28, 87) mg/L, and inflammatory cytokines(TNF alpha 67.2(51.0, 72.9)vs. 22.6(19.3, 31.0) ng/L, IL-6 47.8(35.2, 88.4)vs. 23.6(20.3, 42.9) ng/L, IL-10 21.3(16.8, 23.9)vs. 35.6(26.5, 38.6) ng/L), which were obviously improved after CBP treatment(all P<0.05). And after CBP treatment, partial pressure of oxygen(PaO(2))/fraction of inspiration O(2)(FiO(2)) (192(101, 208)and 240(207, 267) mmHg, 1 mmHg=0.133 kPa), MAP (58.3(56.3, 62.5) and 83.3(74.0, 87.4) mmHg) and PCIS scores (66(62.5, 72)and 92(89, 94) scores) were higher (all P<0.05). Conclusion: CBP in critically ill with SAP can rapidly reduce blood amylase and lipase, help to keep the stable internal environment, block the systemic inflammatory response, improve the organ functions and maintain the fluid balance.CBP treatment may be a potential therapy in children with SAP."

            "abstract": "Red blood cell transfusions are a common life-saving intervention for neonates and children with anemia, but transfusion decisions, indications, and doses in neonates and children are different from those of adults. Patient blood management (PBM) programs are designed to assist clinicians with appropriately transfusing patients. Although PBM programs are well recognized and appreciated in the adult setting, they are quite far from standard of care in the pediatric patient population. Adult PBM standards cannot be uniformly applied to children, and there currently is significant variation in transfusion practices. Because transfusing unnecessarily can expose children to increased risk without benefit, it is important to design PBM programs to standardize transfusion decisions. This article assesses the key elements necessary for a successful pediatric PBM program, systematically explores various possible pediatric specific blood conservation strategies and the current available literature supporting them, and outlines the gaps in the evidence suggesting need for further/improved research. Pediatric PBM programs are critically important initiatives that not only involve a cooperative effort between pediatric surgery, anesthesia, perfusion, critical care, and transfusion medicine services but also need operational support from administration, clinical leadership, finance, and the hospital information technology personnel. These programs also expand the scope for high-quality collaborative research. A key component of pediatric PBM programs is monitoring pediatric blood utilization and assessing adherence to transfusion guidelines. Data suggest that restrictive transfusion strategies should be used for neonates and children similar to adults, but further research is needed to assess the best oxygenation requirements, hemoglobin threshold, and transfusion strategy for patients with active bleeding, hemodynamic instability, unstable cardiac disease, and cyanotic cardiac disease. Perioperative blood management strategies include minimizing blood draws, restricting transfusions, intraoperative cell salvage, acute normovolemic hemodilution, antifibrinolytic agents, and using point-of-care tests to guide transfusion decisions. However, further research is needed for the use of intravenous iron, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and possible use of whole blood and pathogen inactivation. There are numerous areas where newly formed collaborations could be used to investigate pediatric transfusion, and these studies would provide critical data to support vital pediatric PBM programs to optimize neonatal and pediatric care."

Recruiting sufficient children with acute lung injury into a pediatric trial is challenging. A Bayesian statistical approach relies on the adult trial for the a priori effect estimate, requiring fewer patients. Preparing for a Bayesian pediatric trial mirroring the Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial, we aimed to: 1) identify an inverse association between fluid balance and ventilator-free days; and 2) determine if fluid balance over time is more similar to adults in the Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial liberal or conservative arms.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      Multicentered retrospective cohort study.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Five pediatric intensive care units.\n    \n\n\n          Patients:\n        \n      \n      Mechanically ventilated children (age≥1 month to <18 yrs) with acute lung injury admitted in 2007-2010.\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      None.\n    \n\n\n          Measurements and main results:\n        \n      \n      Fluid intake, output, and net fluid balance were collected on days 1-7 in 168 children with acute lung injury (median age 3 yrs, median PaO2/FIO2 138) and weight-adjusted (mL/kg). Using multivariable linear regression to adjust for age, gender, race, admission day illness severity, PaO2/FIO2, and vasopressor use, increasing cumulative fluid balance (mL/kg) on day 3 was associated with fewer ventilator-free days (p=.02). Adjusted for weight, daily fluid balance on days 1-3 and cumulative fluid balance on days 1-7 were higher in these children compared to adults in the Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial conservative arm (p<.001, each day) and was similar to adults in the liberal arm.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Increasing fluid balance on day 3 in children with acute lung injury at these centers is independently associated with fewer ventilator-free days.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of vitamin B-6 supplementation on oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in neonatal rats undergoing hyperoxia therapy. The study consisted of 2 parts: a survival study and a vitamin B-6 efficacy study for 16 days. Neonatal rats were randomly divided into either the control group, B-6 group (subcutaneously injected with 90 mg/kg/d of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate [PLP]), O2 group (treated with 85% oxygen), or O2 + B-6 group (simultaneously treated with 85% oxygen and 90 mg/kg/d PLP). After the survival study was done, the vitamin B-6 efficacy study was performed with duplicate neonatal rats sacrificed on the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 16th day. Serum inflammatory cytokines, tissue pathology, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. In the survival study, the survival rate of neonatal rats in the control, B-6, O2, and O2 + B-6 group on the 16th day were 100%, 100%, 25%, and 62.50%, respectively. The efficacy study showed lung polymorphonuclear granulocyte (PMN) and macrophage infiltration, increased liver hemopoiesis, and higher MDA levels in liver homogenates at days 3 through 16 in the O2 group. Vitamin B-6 supplementation considerably increased serum inflammatory cytokines in either the 6th or 9th day and decreased liver MDA level before the 6th day. These results indicate that neonatal rats receiving hyperoxia treatment suffered divergent serum inflammatory responses and were in increased liver oxidative stress. Vitamin B-6 supplementation seemed to improve survival rates, change systemic inflammatory response, and decrease liver oxidative stress while neonatal rats were under hyperoxia treatment."

            "abstract": "Although approximately 10% of all newborn infants receive some form of assistance after birth, only 1% of neonates require more advanced measures of life support. Because such situations cannot always be anticipated, paediatricians and neonatologists are frequently unavailable and resuscitation is delegated to the anaesthesiologist. The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, the European Resuscitation Council and the American Heart Association have recently updated the guidelines on neonatal resuscitation. The revised guidelines propose a simplified resuscitation algorithm that highlights the central role of respiratory support and promotes an increasing heart rate as the best indicator for effective ventilation. The most striking change in the new guidelines is the recommendation to start resuscitation in term infants with room air rather than 100% oxygen. Continuous pulse oximetry is recommended to monitor both heart rate and an appropriate increase in preductal oxygen saturation. Supplemental oxygen should only be used if, despite effective ventilation, the heart rate does not increase above 100 beats min(-1), or if oxygenation as indicated by pulse oximetry, remains unacceptably low. This review will focus on foetal physiology and pathophysiological aspects of neonatal adaptation and, thus, attempt to provide a solid basis for understanding the new resuscitation guidelines."

The aim of this study was to assess right ventricular function in children with severe RSV disease and to investigate an association with disease severity, myocardial damage, and hepatitis.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a prospective observational study performed at a 20-bed regional multidisciplinary tertiary pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in a university-affiliated children's hospital. Pulse wave Doppler echocardiographic assessments with a calculation of the right ventricular function (Tei index), left ventricular ejection fraction and diameters, cardiac troponin T levels, transaminase and C-reactive protein levels were performed at admission on consecutive children who were ventilated and diagnosed with a severe RSV infection and without congenital heart disease.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-four ventilated children with confirmed RSV bronchiolitis were enrolled. The median age was 1.4 months (range 0.4-11.7), and the median length of ventilation was 5 days (range 2-10). Seven (20%) infants had an elevated right ventricular Tei index indicating reduced right ventricular function. Left ventricular function as well as C-reactive protein and transaminase levels were not different between patients with and without an elevated right ventricular Tei index. Cardiac troponin T was elevated in 14 patients (41%): 3/7 with an elevated and 11/27 with a normal Tei index (P=1). Ventilation and oxygenation indices and the duration of mechanical ventilation were not different between the two groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      A raised right ventricular Tei index, consistent with reduced right ventricular function, was observed in severe RSV disease, but the degree of dysfunction was not related to the level of biochemical myocardial or hepatic damage or level of respiratory support."

Although there were no differences in PaO2 or PaCO2 between survivors and nonsurvivors, arterial-alveolar oxygen gradients were significantly greater in nonsurviving infants.

Upon arrival in the hospital the child had fixed, dilated pupils and asystole. Core temperature was 19.8 degrees C. Rewarming was conducted slowly while cardiopulmonary resuscitation was continued. Twenty minutes after arrival at the hospital, ventricular complexes appeared in the ECG (temperature 22.1 degrees C); after another 10 min this converted to sinus rhythm. At short intervals, blood gas analyses and electrolyte determinations were carried out and corrected adequately. For cerebral protection methohexital was given and the child was hyperventilated. Seventy minutes after arrival at the hospital the child was brought to the pediatric ICU with stable circulation. There, further rewarming (centrally/peripherally combined) was carried out, aiming at 1 degree C rewarming per hour until a normal temperature was reached. The patient had to be kept on the ventilator for 10 days and after another 2 weeks was discharged home. He had recovered completely without any cerebral damage. One of the reasons why 88 min of cardiac arrest were tolerated by this patient without sequelae may have been rapid and deep hypothermia."

The PRP is an emergency medical care plan which supports the provision of the most appropriate level of intervention for the child whether they are at home, school, short break unit or hospital. The PRP template is presented with advice on implementation and case examples. Feedback from families, medical and nursing staff is that PRPs are useful and empowering. The system supports timely discussions about appropriate care in an emergency and the communication of decisionsmade jointly by the child, family and medical team to all concerned. A flexible and person-specific PRP stating what interventions to do such as airway clearance, facial oxygen, trial of bag and mask ventilation is preferable to a do not attempt resuscitation form which is an 'all or nothing system' and can seem very negative to families. A PRP in the home can support appropriate action from local rapid response teams set up to review unexpected child deaths."

A retrospective review of admissions to our PICU in the past 3 years showed that 16 cases met the criteria of pediatric ARDS. The incidence was 0.2% of all PICU admissions. The predisposing factors were varied, and pneumonia was the most common. The mean values of acute lung injury scores, ventilation indices and PaO2/FiO2 on admission were 3.6 +/- 0.5, 68.0 +/- 32.8 and 71.6 +/- 25.2, respectively.

Careful follow-up studies have demonstrated that relatively small variations in oxygenation and gas exchange, ventilator management, and other management modalities can have long-term consequences. Within this context, there are good data that closure of a clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus has outcome benefit, but little data on the idealized anesthetic to manage such fragile patients. Does the anesthetic management matter? Given the attention to detail within the NICU, it would seem prudent to try to choose techniques that limit changes in hemodynamics, gas exchange, and ventilation within the context of the surgery. Anesthesia for ductal ligation in the very low-birth weight infant may need to be judged by more than simple survival and brings into question the current techniques and monitoring used."

In all patients, the absolute value of the difference between arterial and capillary pH was < or = 0.05. There was a strong correlation between arterial and capillary PCO2 (r2 = .955, p < .0001). The relative average bias of the capillary PCO2 was 1.6 torr (0.21 kPa), with capillary higher than arterial and 95% limits of agreement of +/- 4.5 torr (+/- 0.6 kPa). In two of 50 patients, the absolute value of the difference between arterial and capillary PCO2 was > 6.5 torr (> 0.87 kPa). Despite a statistically significant correlation between capillary and arterial PO2 (r2 = .358, p < .0001), the absolute value of the difference between arterial and capillary PO2 was > 6.5 torr (> 0.87 kPa) in 42 of 50 patients. Pain, endotracheal intubation, vasoactive drips, or pharmacologic paralysis did not affect accuracy of the capillary pH or PCO2.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Capillary blood gases accurately reflect arterial pH and PCO2 in most pediatric intensive care unit patients. Capillary samples did not significantly underestimate arterial hypercarbia or acidosis.

We evaluated the frequency of PVAP in a cohort of children diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia according to traditional criteria and compared their strength of association with clinically relevant outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      Retrospective cohort study.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Tertiary care pediatric hospital.\n    \n\n\n          Patients:\n        \n      \n      Critically ill children (0-18 yr) diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia between January 2006 and December 2015 were identified from an infection control database.

Primary outcome was the proportion of subjects diagnosed with PVAP. Secondary outcomes included association with intervals of care. Two hundred seventy-seven children who had been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia were eligible for review; 46 were excluded for being ventilated under 48 hours (n = 16), on high frequency ventilation (n = 12), on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 8), ineligible bacteria isolated from culture (n = 8), and other causes (n = 4). ICU admission diagnoses included congenital heart disease (47%), neurological (16%), trauma (7%), respiratory (7%), posttransplant (4%), neuromuscular (3%), and cardiomyopathy (3%). Only 16% of subjects (n = 45) met the new PVAP definition, with 18% (n = 49) having any ventilator-associated condition. Failure to fulfill new definitions was based on inadequate increase in mean airway pressure in 90% or FIO2 in 92%. PVAP was associated with prolonged ventilation (median [interquartile range], 29 d [13-51 d] vs 16 d [8-34.5 d]; p = 0.002), ICU (median [interquartile range], 40 d [20-100 d] vs 25 d [14-61 d]; p = 0.004) and hospital length of stay (median [interquartile range], 81 d [40-182 d] vs 54 d [31-108 d]; p = 0.04), and death (33% vs 16%; p = 0.008).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Few children with ventilator-associated pneumonia diagnosis met the proposed PVAP criteria.

            "abstract": "An 11-yr-old female without any pulmonary disorders underwent laser resections of laryngotracheal tumors using high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) 6 times over a period of 17 months at our institute. In this series of surgeries, we studied the effects on PaO2 and PaCO2 during HFJV of changes of either frequency or inspiratory time. Increasing the frequency from 100 to 400/min decreased the PaO2 and increased the PaCO2. Decreasing the inspiratory time from 30% to 20% increased the PaCO2, although it did not affect the PaO2. All the procedures were uneventfully carried out without critically impairing gas exchange during HFJV. In this patient with normal lung function, CO2 elimination during HFJV appeared to be facilitated by either decreasing the frequency or increasing the inspiratory time. Arterial oxygen tension during HFJV was higher at lower frequencies."

            "abstract": "The development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) requires multiple pulmonary vascular insults, yet the role of early oxygen therapy as an initial pulmonary vascular insult remains poorly defined. Here, we employ a two-hit model of PH, utilizing postnatal hyperoxia followed by adult hypoxia exposure, to evaluate the role of early hyperoxic lung injury in the development of later PH. Sprague-Dawley pups were exposed to 90% oxygen during postnatal days 0-4 or 0-10 or to room air. All pups were then allowed to mature in room air. At 10 wk of age, a subset of rats from each group was exposed to 2 wk of hypoxia (Patm = 362 mmHg). Physiological, structural, and biochemical endpoints were assessed at 12 wk. Prolonged (10 days) postnatal hyperoxia was independently associated with elevated right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure, which worsened after hypoxia exposure later in life. These findings were only partially explained by decreases in lung microvascular density. Surprisingly, postnatal hyperoxia resulted in robust RV hypertrophy and more preserved RV function and exercise capacity following adult hypoxia compared with nonhyperoxic rats. Biochemically, RVs from animals exposed to postnatal hyperoxia and adult hypoxia demonstrated increased capillarization and a switch to a fetal gene pattern, suggesting an RV more adept to handle adult hypoxia following postnatal hyperoxia exposure. We concluded that, despite negative impacts on pulmonary artery pressures, postnatal hyperoxia exposure may render a more adaptive RV phenotype to tolerate late pulmonary vascular insults."

This study aimed to analyze the efficacy of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in pediatric cardiac patients. NPPV was used (1) as an alternative means of respiratory support in patients with hypoxemic or hypercarbic respiratory failure or with signs of respiratory distress that were considered to require intubation; or (2) as a preventive measure in patients with high risk for extubation failure. Between 2008 and 2011, there were 107 episodes of NPPV use in 82 patients. Their median age was 57 days (range 1 day to 18 years), and weight was 4.1 kg (range 1.7-68). Within the first hour of NPPV, partial pressure of carbon dioxide/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) was significantly increased, and arterial pCO2, and respiratory rate were decreased. This decrease in respiratory rate and increase in PaO 2/FiO2 continued during the first 24 h of therapy, and pCO2 was decreased during the first 6 h. In 59.8% of cases, NPPV was successfully used without the need for tracheal intubation. The Aristotle Basic Complexity score, presence of infection, residual cardiac defect, and pH <7.36 in the first hour were independent predictors of NPPV failure. We conclude that NPPV improved oxygenation and decreased respiratory effort in pediatric cardiac patients, 59.8% of whom eventually did not receive intubation. A high-complexity surgical score, presence of infection, residual cardiac defect, and pH <7.36 in the first hour are predictors of NPPV failure, which occurs in most patients >24 h after the onset of therapy."

The best SpO2/FIO2-PaO2/FIO2 relationship was chosen according to the ability to detect respiratory failure (PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 200). The discrimination of the original Pediatric Index of Mortality-3 score and a derived Pediatric Index of Mortality-3 score (where SpO2/FIO2-derived PaO2/FIO2 values were used in place of missing PaO2/FIO2 values) were compared in a different cohort (n = 1,205). The best SpO2/FIO2-PaO2/FIO2 relationship in 1,703 SpO2/FIO2-to-PaO2/FIO2 data pairs was a linear regression equation of ln[PF] regressed on ln[SF]. This equation identified children with a PaO2/FIO2 less than or equal to 200 with a specificity of 73% and sensitivity of 61% in children with SpO2 less than 97% (92% and 33%, respectively, when SpO2 ≥ 97%) in the validation cohort. PaO2/FIO2 derived from SpO2/FIO2 (derived PaO2/FIO2) was better at predicting PICU mortality (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.55-0.73) compared with the original PaO2/FIO2 (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.49-0.59; p = 0.02). However, there was no difference in the original and derived Pediatric Index of Mortality-3 scores and their discriminatory ability for mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      SpO2-based metrics perform no worse than arterial blood gas-based metrics in mortality prediction models. Future Pediatric Index of Mortality score versions may be improved by the inclusion of risk factors based on oxygen saturation values, especially in settings where PaO2 values are missing in a significant proportion of cases."

            "abstract": "The objective of the study was to report our institutional experience in the management of children and newborns with refractory septic shock who required venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) treatment, and to identify patient-and infection-related factors associated with mortality. This is a retrospective case series in an intensive care unit of a tertiary pediatric center. Inclusion criteria were patients ≤ 18 years old who underwent a VA ECMO due to a refractory septic shock due to circulatory collapse. Patient conditions and support immediately before ECMO, analytical and hemodynamic parameter evolution during ECMO, and post-canulation outcome data were collected. Twenty-one patients were included, 13 of them (65%) male. Nine were pediatric and 12 were newborns. Median septic shock duration prior to ECMO was 29.5 h (IQR, 20-46). Eleven patients (52.4%) suffered cardiac arrest (CA). Neonatal patients had worse Sepsis Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Oxygenation Index and PaO2/FiO2 ratio, blood gas analysis, lactate levels, and left ventricular ejection fraction compared to pediatric patients. Survival was 33.3% among pediatric patients (60% if we exclude pneumococcal cases) and 50% among newborns. Hours of sepsis evolution and mean airway pressure (MAP) prior to ECMO were significantly higher in the non-survivor group. CA was not a predictor of mortality. Streptococcus pneumoniae infection was a mortality risk factor. There was an improvement in survival during the second period, from 14.3 to 57.2%, related to shorter sepsis evolution before ECMO placement, better candidate selection, and greater ECMO support once the patient was placed.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Patients with refractory septic shock should be transferred precociously to a referral ECMO center. However, therapy should be used with caution in patients with vasoplegic pattern shock or S. pneumoniae sepsis. What is Known: • Children with refractory septic shock have significant mortality rates, and although ECMO is recommended, overall survival is low. • There are no studies regarding characteristics of infections as predictors of pediatric survival in ECMO. What is New: • Septic children should be transferred precociously to referral ECMO centers during the first hours if patients do not respond to conventional therapy. • Treatment should be used with caution in patients with vasoplegic pattern shock or S. pneumoniae sepsis."

            "abstract": "Oxygen is essential for multicellular existence. Its reduction to water by the mitochondrial electron transport chain forms the cornerstone of aerobic metabolism. Conditions in which oxygen is limiting for electron transport result in bioenergetic collapse in metazoans. However, compared with postnatal existence, all of mammalian development occurs in a hypoxic environment in utero. Not just an epiphenomenon, this 'physiological hypoxia' is required for the activation of a transcriptional response mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcriptional regulators that coordinates the expression of hundreds of genes, many with developmentally critical functions. Oxygen tension, therefore, is a morphogen. Understanding the physiological significance of hypoxia responses during human development and the role of the HIF family of transcriptional regulators will have important consequences for the care of preterm neonates. Defining clinical care guidelines for the proper oxygenation of critically ill neonates that take account of these observations is therefore of paramount importance. The pharmacological stabilization of HIF family members may therefore have clinical utility in premature infants in whom this important morphogen has been inactivated by exposure to supraphysiological oxygen levels."

The successful introduction of artificial ventilation for neonatal respiratory failure treatment has changed tremendously the prognosis of many diseases with a fatal outcome. This retrospective observational longitudinal study was designed to evaluate the changes in the following main indices: mean airway pressure (MAP), oxygenation index (OI), arterial-to-alveolar oxygen tension ratio (a/A PO2), alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-a)DO2, ventilation index and VEI in VLBW infants treated with conventional ventilatory support (CV), assess the information yield of these indices as indicators of gas exchange at each and every one moment of CV, and to analyze their feasibility, accuracy and real-time convenience as indicators of the adequacy of inhalation therapy and their role as an indispensable tool in constructing the optimal treatment regimen in VLBW infants. Forty-seven VLBW infants requiring ventilatory support within 24 hours of birth were enrolled in the study. Four of the infants survived and the remaining 43 died. The data collected were entered into a high-yield Neonatal Intensive Computer File and the indices were followed up sequentially and thoroughly analyzed as the primary outcome measures of the study. Our results show that: 1. The combination of indices we propose is a useful high-yield discriminating method for evaluating the efficacy of neonatal ventilatory support, arterial blood gas exchange and clinical status. 2. These indices allow early diagnosis of the changes in pulmonary mechanics, hemodynamics and blood saturation. 3. Using the combination of indices improves the diagnostic reliability and information yield of each one of them. 4. The twofold pattern of change of the indices in VLBW infants is well-recognized:--whereas a/A and OI change rapidly in the group of non-survivors reflecting the delicate balance in optimal gas-exchange using conventional methods in the survivors group there is a sustained tendency towards an increase in a/A values with a concomitant decrease in OI values. The airway pressure is constant in the presence of great fluctuations in OI values reflecting the breakdown in oxygenation at the high price paid for its sustenance in the nonsurvivors group whereas the mean airway pressure showed a gradual decrease in the survivors group and allowed early weaning from mechanical ventilation. (A-a)DO2 remained high in the non-survivors group thus reflecting a high-degree, practically constant shunting whereas the same index showed a tendency towards decrease in the survivors group. 5. These indices allow optimal management of neonatal ventilation and oxygenation and timely correction or a change of the ventilatory or/and oxygenation strategy. 6. This information forms the basis for prognostic conclusions regarding the current status or the survival of the neonates."

Meta-analyses in this population suggest that high levels of supplemental oxygen resulting in hyperoxia are associated with mortality. This mini-review focuses on the non-neonatal pediatric literature examining the relationship between PaO2 and mortality. While only one pilot pediatric randomized-controlled trials exists, over the past decade, there have been at least eleven observational studies examining the relationship between PaO2 values and mortality in critically ill children. These analyses of mixed-case pediatric ICU populations have generally reported a parabolic (\"u-shaped\") relationship between PaO2 and mortality, similar to that seen in the adult literature. However, the estimates of the point at which hyperoxemia becomes deleterious have varied widely (300-550 mmHg). Where attempted, this effect has been robust to analyses restricted to the first PaO2 value obtained, those obtained within 24 h of admission, anytime during admission, and the number of hyperoxemic blood gases over time. These findings have also been noted when using various methods of risk-adjustment (accounting for severity of illness scores or complex chronic conditions). Similar relationships were found in the majority of studies restricted to patients undergoing care after cardiac arrest. Taken together, the majority of the literature suggests that there is a robust parabolic relationship between PaO2 and risk-adjusted pediatric ICU mortality, but that the exact threshold at which hyperoxemia becomes deleterious is unclear, and likely beyond the typical target value for most clinical indications. Findings suggest that clinicians should remain judicious and thoughtful in the use of supplemental oxygen therapy in critically ill children."

Renal recovery occurred in 65 (96%) of 68 patients before discharge. One neonatal patient had sepsis-induced renal injury on transfer, but had normal creatinine 1 month later. Two pediatric patients with vasculitis and primary renal disease at presentation (both meeting Failure criteria) developed end-stage renal disease.

Concern for precipitating chronic renal failure by using CRRT during ECMO is not substantiated by this large single-center experience. Consistent with previous reports, mortality is higher in patients receiving concomitant CRRT and ECMO compared with those receiving ECMO alone.

The primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality, with secondary analyses of the length of hospital and ICU stay.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Between January and July 2020, among 811 patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19, the median age was 64 (interquartile range [IQR] 53-75) years, 495 (61.0%) were men, 46 (5.7%) were health care workers, 9 (1.1%) were pregnant, 26 (3.2%) were younger than 18 years and 9 (1.1%) were younger than 5 years. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 7 (IQR 3-10) days. The most common symptoms on admission were fever, shortness of breath, cough and malaise. Diabetes, hypertension and cardiac, kidney and respiratory disease were the most common comorbidities. Among all patients, 328 received care in an ICU, admitted a median of 0 (IQR 0-1) days after hospital admission. Critically ill patients received treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation (88.8%), renal replacement therapy (14.9%) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (4.0%); 26.2% died. Among those receiving mechanical ventilation, 31.2% died. Age was an influential predictor of mortality (odds ratio per additional year of life 1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.09).\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 commonly had fever, respiratory symptoms and comorbid conditions. Increasing age was associated with the development of critical illness and death; however, most critically ill patients in Canada, including those requiring mechanical ventilation, survived and were discharged from hospital."

Although allogeneic blood has become increasingly safer from infectious agents, mounting evidence indicates that RBC transfusions are associated with complications and unfavorable outcomes. As a result, there has been growing interest and efforts to limit RBC transfusion, and indications are being revisited and revamped. Although a so-called restrictive RBC transfusion strategy has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in critically ill adults, there have been relatively few studies on RBC transfusion performed in critically ill children.\n    \n\n\n          Data sources:\n        \n      \n      Published literature on transfusion medicine and outcomes of RBC transfusion. STUDY SELECTION, DATA EXTRACTION, AND SYNTHESIS: After a brief overview of physiology of oxygen transportation, anemia compensation, and current transfusion guidelines based on available literature, risks and outcomes of transfusion in general and in critically ill children are summarized in conjunction with studies investigating the safety of restrictive transfusion strategies in this patient population.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The available evidence does not support the extensive use of RBC transfusions in general or critically ill patients. Transfusions are still associated with risks, and although their benefits are established in limited situations, the associated negative outcomes in many more patients must be closely addressed. Given the frequency of anemia and its proven negative outcomes, transfusion decisions in the critically ill children should be based on individual patient's characteristics rather than generalized triggers, with consideration of potential risks and benefits, and available blood conservation strategies that can reduce transfusion needs."

We explored the current practice of oxygen administration using a case vignette in paediatric intensive care units (PICU) in the united kingdom. Methods. We conducted an online survey of Paediatric Intensive Care Society members in the UK. The survey outlined a clinical scenario followed by questions on oxygenation targets for 5 common diagnoses seen in critically ill children. Results. Fifty-three paediatric intensive care unit members from 10 institutions completed the survey. In a child with moderate ventilatory requirements, 21 respondents (42%) did not follow arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) targets. In acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrest, and sepsis, there was a trend to aim for lower PaO2 as the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) increased. Conversely, in traumatic brain injury and pulmonary hypertension, respondents aimed for normal PaO2 even as the FiO2 increased. Conclusions. In this sample of clinicians PaO2 targets were not commonly used. Clinicians target lower PaO2 as FiO2 increases in acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrest, and sepsis whilst targeting normal range irrespective of FiO2 in traumatic brain injury and pulmonary hypertension."

Early diagnosis and prompt institution of adequate treatment may be life-saving for pediatric patients with cardiocirculatory instability in the setting of intensive care. However, the hemodynamic status of the critically ill child is poorly reflected by baseline vital parameters or laboratory blood tests. A reliable tool for diagnosis and monitoring of evolution of both heart performance and vascular status is strictly needed. Advanced hemodynamic monitoring consists - among others - of measuring cardiac output, predicting fluid responsiveness and calculating systemic oxygen delivery. Identification and quantifying of pulmonary edema has also been recently appreciated in pediatric critical care. In the last decade, the number of vasoactive drugs has increased, together with a better understanding of clinical application of both different monitoring devices and treatment strategies."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      In April, 2020, clinicians in the UK observed a cluster of children with unexplained inflammation requiring admission to paediatric intensive care units (PICUs). We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, course, management, and outcomes of patients admitted to PICUs with this condition, which is now known as paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We did a multicentre observational study of children (aged <18 years), admitted to PICUs in the UK between April 1 and May 10, 2020, fulfilling the case definition of PIMS-TS published by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. We analysed routinely collected, de-identified data, including demographic details, presenting clinical features, underlying comorbidities, laboratory markers, echocardiographic findings, interventions, treatments, and outcomes; serology information was collected if available. PICU admission rates of PIMS-TS were compared with historical trends of PICU admissions for four similar inflammatory conditions (Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and macrophage activation syndrome).\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      78 cases of PIMS-TS were reported by 21 of 23 PICUs in the UK. Historical data for similar inflammatory conditions showed a mean of one (95% CI 0·85-1·22) admission per week, compared to an average of 14 admissions per week for PIMS-TS and a peak of 32 admissions per week during the study period. The median age of patients was 11 years (IQR 8-14). Male patients (52 [67%] of 78) and those from ethnic minority backgrounds (61 [78%] of 78) were over-represented. Fever (78 [100%] patients), shock (68 [87%]), abdominal pain (48 [62%]), vomiting (49 [63%]), and diarrhoea (50 [64%]) were common presenting features. Longitudinal data over the first 4 days of admission showed a serial reduction in C-reactive protein (from a median of 264 mg/L on day 1 to 96 mg/L on day 4), D-dimer (4030 μg/L to 1659 μg/L), and ferritin (1042 μg/L to 757 μg/L), whereas the lymphocyte count increased to more than 1·0 × 109 cells per L by day 3 and troponin increased over the 4 days (from a median of 157 ng/mL to 358 ng/mL). 36 (46%) of 78 patients were invasively ventilated and 65 (83%) needed vasoactive infusions; 57 (73%) received steroids, 59 (76%) received intravenous immunoglobulin, and 17 (22%) received biologic therapies. 28 (36%) had evidence of coronary artery abnormalities (18 aneurysms and ten echogenicity). Three children needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and two children died.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      During the study period, the rate of PICU admissions for PIMS-TS was at least 11-fold higher than historical trends for similar inflammatory conditions. Clinical presentations and treatments varied. Coronary artery aneurysms appear to be an important complication. Although immediate survival is high, the long-term outcomes of children with PIMS-TS are unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      None."

A major contributor to these complications may be weakness and overall deconditioning secondary to pretransplant critical illness and immobility. In an attempt to address this issue, we developed a collaborative program to allow for active rehabilitation and physical therapy for patients requiring life support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before lung transplantation.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      An interdisciplinary team responded to an acute need to develop a mechanism for active rehabilitation and physical therapy for patients awaiting lung transplantation while being managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

PATIENTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN RESULTS: Three patients (ages 16, 20, and 24 yrs) with end-stage respiratory failure were rehabilitated while on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation awaiting lung transplantation. These patients were involved in active rehabilitation and physical therapy and, ultimately, were ambulatory on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before successful transplantation. Following lung transplantation, the patients were liberated from mechanical ventilation, weaned to room air, transitioned out of the intensive care unit, and ambulatory less than 1 wk posttransplant.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A comprehensive, multidisciplinary system can be developed to safely allow for active rehabilitation, physical therapy, and ambulation of patients being managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Such programs may lead to a decreased threshold for the utilization of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before transplant and have the potential to improve conditioning, decrease resource utilization, and lead to better outcomes in patients who require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before lung transplantation."

This underrecognition can result in a critical delay in diagnosis causing increased morbidity and mortality. This study examines the clinical course of patients treated for ACS at our institution.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A review of children requiring an emergency laparotomy (n = 264) identified 26 patients with a diagnosis of ACS. ACS was defined as sustained intraabdominal hypertension (bladder pressure >12 mm Hg) that was associated with new onset organ dysfunction or failure.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patients ranged in age from 3 months to 17 years old and were cared for in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Twenty-seven percent (n = 7) were transferred from referring hospitals, 50% (n = 13) were admitted directly from the emergency department, and 23% (n = 6) were inpatients before being transferred to PICU. Admission diagnoses included infectious enterocolitis (n = 12), postsurgical procedure (n = 10), and others (n = 4). Patients progressed to ACS rapidly, with most requiring decompressive laparotomy within 8 hours of PICU admission (range, <1-96 hours). Preoperatively, all patients had maximum ventilatory support and oliguria, 85% (n = 22) required vasopressors/inotropes, and 31% (n = 8) required hemodialysis. Mean bladder pressure was 25 mm Hg (range, 12-44 mm Hg). In 42% (n = 11), cardiac arrest preceeded decompressive laparotomy. All patients showed evidence of tissue ischemia before decompressive laparotomy with an average preoperative lactate of 8 (range, 1.2-20). Decompressive laparotomy was done at the bedside in the PICU in 13 patients and in the operating room in 14 patients. Abdominal wounds were managed with open vacuum pack or silastic silo dressings. Physiologic data including fluid resuscitation, oxygen index, mean airway pressure, vasopressor score, and urine output were recorded at 6-hour intervals beginning 12 hours before decompressive laparotomy and extending 12 hours after operation. The data demonstrate improvement of all physiologic parameters after decompressive laparotomy except for urine output, which continued to be minimal 12 hours post intervention. Mortality was 58% (n = 15) overall. The only significant factor related to increased mortality was bladder pressure (P = .046; odds ratio, 1.258). Cardiac arrest before decompressive laparotomy, need for hemodialysis, and transfer from referring hospital also trended toward increased mortality but did not reach significance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Abdominal compartment syndrome in children carries a high mortality and may be a consequence of common childhood diseases such as enterocolitis. The diagnosis of ACS and the potential need for emergent decompressive laparotomy may be infrequently discussed in the pediatric literature. Increased awareness of ACS may promote earlier diagnosis, treatment, and possibly improve outcomes."

These probes are calibrated in healthy adult volunteers between arterial saturations of ~75 and 100%, using the gold standard of co-oximetry on arterial blood samples. There are little data to attest their accuracy in cyanotic congenital heart disease. Aims We aimed to assess the accuracy of a commonly used probe in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Children with cyanotic congenital heart disease admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit with an arterial line in situ were included to our study.

However, planning at a national, state, or local level to address the particular medical resource needs of children for mass critical care has yet to occur in any coordinated way. This paper presents the consensus opinion of the Task Force regarding supplies and equipment that would be required during a pediatric mass critical care crisis.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In May 2008, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care published guidance on provision of mass critical care to adults. Acknowledging that the critical care needs of children during disasters were unaddressed by this effort, a 17-member Steering Committee, assembled by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education with guidance from members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, convened in April 2009 to determine priority topic areas for pediatric emergency mass critical care recommendations.Steering Committee members established subcommittees by topic area and performed literature reviews of MEDLINE and Ovid databases. The Steering Committee produced draft outlines through consensus-based study of the literature and convened October 6-7, 2009, in New York, NY, to review and revise each outline. Eight draft documents were subsequently developed from the revised outlines as well as through searches of MEDLINE updated through March 2010.The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts from diverse public health, medical, and disaster response fields, convened in Atlanta, GA, on March 29-30, 2010.

The recommended size-specific pediatric mass critical care equipment stockpile for two types of patients is presented in terms of equipment needs per ten mass critical care beds, which would serve 26 patients over a 10-day period. Specific recommendations are made regarding ventilator capacity, including the potential use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

            "abstract": "Morbidity and mortality derived from asthma continue to be a main public health problem in many countries, in spite of the advances in the knowledge on the disease and its treatment. There are several risk factors for asthma attack which have to be considered in the management of patients in order to prevent exacerbations and mortality. Smooth bronchial muscle constriction and inflammation with oedema of the bronchial wall are the facts that cause airway flow and resistance disturbances, with hyperinflation, leading to a bigger respiratory work. On the other hand, the bronchial obstruction leads to a ventilation-perfusion disequilibrium and hypoxia. At the beginning of the process there is hypocarbia, but when the attack progresses muscle fatigue happens, and retention of CO2, being a sing of alarm (predictive of respiratory failure) a normal and rising PaCO2. The evaluation of an acute asthmatic patient should accomplish a clinical and objective assessment (peak flow rate and saturation of O2), in order to classify the crisis in: mild, moderate or severe. Managing acute asthmatic patient includes: oxygen, bronchodilator ss2 agonists at high and even continuous doses and systemic corticosteroids to prevent the progression and to control inflammation. These procedures should be promptly instituted. Although there is less evidence on their beneficial effects other measures as intravenous aminophylline, nebulized anticholynergics, magnesium sulphate and intravenous ss2 agonists may be used when the conventional therapy is not quickly successful and the patient is in a critical situation, at a real risk of respiratory failure, and in order to avoid mechanical ventilation. If this is finally instituted, controlled hypoventilation with permissive hypercarbia is now recommended, to avoid barotrauma, which used to be a frequent complication when more aggressive attitude was the rule. Interaction between paralytic agents and corticosteroids may produce a miopathy, so the recommendation now is to try not to use paralytic agents, even with profound sedation of needed. Sixty four patients were treated on 77 occasions in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of our hospital. They were 0,5 to 13,9 years old, being 50% less than 5 years old. It was the first attack in 9 (14%) patients. The standard management consisted of oxygen, frequently or continuously nebulized salbutamol and intravenous methylprednisolone (1 to 6 mg/kg/day). Furthermore nebulized ipratropium bromide was administered 58 times (75%), as well as intravenous aminophylline 69 (89%), intravenous salbutamol 23 (30%), magnesium sulphate 16 (21%) and ketamine 10 (13%). Antibiotics were given 22 times (29%). Two 15 month old infants received mechanical ventilation in three occasions, and relevant complications happened (pneumothorax and myopathy, and pneumomediastinum and bronchiolitis obliterans respectively). Fifty six patients have been followed for a period of 3 to 110 months (median 48 months), and 16 (29%) have needed high doses (equal to or move than 800 mcg of budesonide or equivalent). There are data on lung function in 36 of them, FEV1 is normal (> 85% of predicted, between 86 and 127) in 26 (78%) and < 85% (65 to 84%) of predicted in 8 (22%) FEV1 rises more than 15% (16 to 23%) in four patients after the inhalation of a ss2 agonist. Inhaled anesthetic agents and heliox have been used in some pediatric cases. After a severe asthma attack the strategy of management should be reviewed, as well as the possible risk factors."

Models accurately predicted greater than or equal to 24 hours of any resource use for 78.9% of patients and greater than or equal to 24 hours of ventilation for 83.1%.

This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01852695.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      From Oct 1, 2012, 26 sites were randomly assigned to provide FICare (n=14) or standard care (n=12). One site assigned to FICare discontinued because of poor site enrolment. Parents and infants were enrolled between April 1, 2013, and Aug 31, 2015, with 895 infants being eligible in the FICare group and 891 in the standard care group. At day 21, weight gain was greater in the FICare group than in the standard care group (mean change in Z scores -0·071 [SD 0·42] vs -0·155 [0·42]; p<0·0002). Average daily weight gain was significantly higher in infants receiving FICare than those receiving standard care (mean daily weight gain 26·7 g [SD 9·4] vs 24·8 g [9·5]; p<0·0001). The high-frequency exclusive breastmilk feeding rate at discharge was higher for infants in the FICare group (279 [70%] of 396) than those in the standard care group (394 [63%] of 624; p=0·016). At day 21, parents in the FICare group had lower mean stress scores than did parents in the standard care group (2·3 [SD 0·8] vs 2·5 [0·8]; p<0·00043), and lower mean anxiety scores (70·8 [20·1] vs 74·2 [19·9]; p=0·0045). There were no significant differences between groups in the rates of the secondary outcomes of mortality, major morbidity, duration of oxygen therapy, and duration of hospital stay. Although the safety assessment was not completed, there were no adverse events.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      FICare improved infant weight gain, decreased parent stress and anxiety, and increased high-frequency exclusive breastmilk feeding at discharge, which together suggest that FICare is an important advancement in neonatal care.

When comparing transfused cases with nontransfused cases, the odds ratio for new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was 5.14 (95% CI, 3.28-8.06; p < 0.001).

            "abstract": "Pertussis is a leading cause of death from community infections in infant. Life-threatening clinical presentations of pertussis can associate multiple organ system failure with respiratory distress. The question of the optimal management of these severe forms of pertussis, in order to reduce the high mortality rate, is raised by the clinicians caring for such patients. We report the case of a 1 month infant who was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for a severe pertussis. He presented with an acute respiratory distress syndrome, a severe pulmonary hypertension was treated initially with mechanical ventilation and nitric oxide. At day 4 (D4), a cardiogenic shock occurred and, despite epinephrine and norepinephrine infusion, fluid expansion, the hemodynamic condition worsened with two episodes of cardiac arrest. The child was then successfully resuscitated, and, facing the extreme hemodynamic instability, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was considered. ECMO allowed epinephrine and norepinephrine to be progressively discontinued, and protective mechanical ventilation. ECMO withdrawal was possible at D9, with milrinone as the sole inotropic agent. Weaning from mechanical ventilation was possible on D15 and the total length of stay in PICU was 20days. While the analysis of the literature, through limited experiences on the use of ECMO in children with severe pertussis does not allow concluding definitively on the utility of ECMO in this situation, the contribution of ECMO in the favourable outcome for our patient was considerable. This is an argument, to our opinion, for considering ECMO in the management of those very instable patients."

The number of medical centers providing ECLS is and will always be limited, so services are needed to transport critically ill patients to ECLS centers. Transport teams should be thoroughly familiar with the pathophysiology of cardiac and respiratory failure. They should be equipped to continue the monitoring and treatment initiated at the referring center, to maintain that level of care during transfer, and to treat complications of the diseases or of the therapy itself. The responsibilities of the referring centers are to acquaint themselves with ECLS programs in their geographic areas and with transport services available. Early communication with complete and accurate information is essential. Developing a program for ECLS during transport is a huge undertaking that should be considered seriously. Not every ECLS center has the resources to embark on such a program. Timely referral should make such complex transfers unnecessary for most patients."

Following tracheal extubation, the CAEC was secured, and humidified oxygen was insufflated through the central lumen (2 to 8 L/min) for a minimum of 4 h, during which oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) and respiratory frequency were monitored. Stridor or other signs of respiratory difficulty were also assessed. The CAEC was removed when it became clinically apparent that the need for tracheal reintubation was unlikely. When patients failed to respond to tracheal extubation, the CAEC was used to facilitate reintubation of these difficult airways.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Respiratory distress necessitating tracheal reintubation occurred in 3 of 40 patients (8%). One patient failed to respond to tracheal extubation twice. None of the patients developed oxyhemoglobin desaturation (SpO2 <90%) before or during tracheal reintubation.

Administration of oxygen through the CAEC diminishes the potential for hypoxia while maintaining the ability to reintubate the trachea, especially when reintubation might prove challenging. Previous data suggest that the CAEC is rigid enough to facilitate tracheal reintubation in adults; this was confirmed in the three patients in our study who required tracheal reintubation. The risk of aspiration, barotrauma, or other airway trauma during prolonged placement of the CAEC appears to be low (zero incidence in 40 patients in this study), and use of the No. 11 CAEC appeared to be safe. Since oxygen can be delivered through the CAEC, it may provide a means to safely evaluate an airway during a trial of extubation, ie, a reversible extubation. Finally, oxygen administration through the CAEC may obviate the need for facemask or nasal cannula following tracheal extubation."

PICU mortality was 29.8%, while a new morbidity was identified in 19.8% of survivors. Among patients who had echocardiograms, 27.9% had evidence of pulmonary hypertension, 23.1% had right ventricular systolic dysfunction, and 22.1% had an atrial communication. Moderate or severe right ventricular dysfunction was associated with higher mortality. Clinicians responded to an improvement in oxygenation by decreasing FIO2 to less than 0.6 within 24 hours in 71% of patients. Timely clinician responsiveness to improved oxygenation with inhaled nitric oxide was associated with more ventilator-free days but not less cardiac arrests, mortality, or additional morbidity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Clinician responsiveness to improved oxygenation was associated with less ventilator days. Algorithms to standardize ventilator management may improve signal to noise ratios in future trials enabling better assessment of the effect of inhaled nitric oxide on patient outcomes. Additionally, confining studies to more selective patient populations such as those with right ventricular dysfunction may be required."

            "abstract": "It has been shown that pressure ulcer formation in critically ill paediatric patients increases morbidity and mortality. We sought to identify factors associated with pressure ulcer formation in paediatric patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). From December 2014 to 2015, we identified patients at our institution who developed a pressure ulcer to create two cohorts: ulcer and no ulcer. Variables of interest included: type of ECMO, ECMO indication, hours on ECMO, location of cannulas, volume of crystalloid and blood products received during the first 7 days or during the length of the ECMO run, albumin and lactate levels on the day of cannulation, and presence of vasopressor support or steroid therapy. Of 43 patients studied, 11 (25.5%) developed a pressure ulcer. Patients that developed ulcers were older (P = 0.001) and weighed more (P = 0.006). Femoral cannulation was more frequent in the ulcer group (36.4% vs 6.3%, P = 0.029), and duration of ECMO was longer (P = 0.007). Age, weight, duration of ECMO, and femoral cannulation may contribute to the development of pressure ulcers in children who require ECMO support. Further analysis is imperative to identify specific techniques and protocols that will prevent pressure ulcers in this critically ill population."

We have accomplished safely both transport and MRI in 21 patients from paediatric intensive care units (ICU). Three children were not considered appropriate for transport from the ICU to the MRI facility. All patients underwent assisted ventilation using a modified Mapleson D system. Monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation and haemodynamic state, including invasive arterial (n = 4) and intracranial pressures (n = 3) was continued successfully using routinely available equipment. All MRI studies were completed successfully with satisfactory image quality and all patients returned to the ICU in satisfactory condition. In contrast with previous reports which have excluded critically ill children, we have demonstrated that MRI may be undertaken safely and efficiently in critically ill children."

However, oxygen can cause tissue injury through reactive oxygen species formation, especially in premature infants with reduced antioxidant defences, and may result in short-term and long-term toxic effects in multiple organ systems. Although most hospitals have the capability to tightly control oxygen delivery to hospitalised neonates, in many circumstances, the need is overlooked during infant transport. Lack of awareness of harm or appropriate medical equipment invariably results in excessive oxygen exposure. We developed a quality improvement programme to decrease oxygen exposure to newborns during their transportation, thus improving patient safety and quality of care."

            "abstract": "Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is known to improve survival in neonates with respiratory failure, there has been a significant decrease in the use of ECMO in recent years. Alternative modalities such as high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and surfactant therapy are associated with this decline. The criteria for the initiation of ECMO, developed about 20 years ago, are likely no longer relevant. We examined the predictive significance of the oxygenation index (OI) as a patient entry criterion for ECMO use. We sought a critical OI level predicting death or chronic lung disease (CLD) with and without ECMO use. We also examined whether patients with certain OIs are more likely to have worse outcomes. One hundred and seventy-four term-newborn admissions between 1995 and 2000 requiring mechanical ventilation were enrolled in the study. Receiver operating curve analysis was performed to find a cutoff value of OI for ECMO initiation. Mortality rates and CLD probability were compared to the worst OIs. Our 6-year ECMO administration experience showed that an OI of 33.2 is a suitable cutoff value for ECMO initiation with high sensitivity and specificity as a predictive criterion. The critical OI value associated with the CLD risk when ECMO is not used is in the 40s. OI is a good predictor of CLD; the probability of CLD increases with higher OIs. Our data support the trend toward the use of new interventions over ECMO, especially for patients with OI scores of less than 33.2. Only when the probability of ventilator-associated lung injury becomes significant is it better to consider ECMO than conventional modalities."

Six NICUs recently increased their lower SpO2 limit and for 62.0% of their nurses this led to a significant alarm increase.

            "abstract": "The optimum range of pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO2) for preterm infants remains controversial. Between November 2015 and February 2016, we conducted a web-based survey aimed to investigate the current and former practices on SpO2 targets in European neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). We obtained valid responses from 193 NICUs, treating 8590 newborns ≤28 weeks per year, across 27 countries. Forty different saturation ranges were reported, ranging from 82-93 to 94-99%. The most frequently utilized SpO2 ranges were 90-95% (28%), 88-95% (12%), 90-94% (5%), and 91-95% (5%). A total of 156 NICUs (81%) changed their SpO2 limits over the last 10 years. The most frequently reported former limits were 88-92% (18%), 85-95% (9%), 88-93 (7%), and 85-92% (6%). The NICUs that increased their SpO2 ranges expected to obtain a reduction in mortality. A 54% of the NICUs found the scientific evidence supporting their SpO2 targeting policy strong or very strong.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We detected a high degree of heterogeneity in pulse oximeter SpO2 target limits across European NICUs. The currently used limits are 3 to 5% higher than the former limits, and the most extreme limits, such as lower below 85% or upper above 96%, have almost been abandoned. What is Known: • For preterm infants requiring supplemental oxygen, the optimum range of pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) to minimize organ damage, without causing hypoxic injury, remains controversial. What is New: • This survey highlights the lack of consensus regarding SpO 2 target limits for preterm infants among European neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). We detected 40 different SpO 2 ranges, and even the most frequently reported range (i.e., 90-95%) was used in only 28% of the 193 respondent NICUs. • A total of 156 NICUs (81%) changed their SpO 2 limits over the last 10 years. The currently used limits are 3 to 5% higher than the former limits, and the most extreme limits, such as lower below 85% or upper above 96%, have almost been abandoned."

The overwhelming majority of patients (95.7%) were sedated for MRI, 3.8% for CT and <1% (three patients) for both modalities. Propofol was used in 98% of cases. Overall, 267 events requiring intervention occurred in 164 patient encounters (25.1%). However, after adjustment for changes from expected physiological response to the sedative, the rate of events was 10.2%. Seventy-five (11.5%) patients had desaturation requiring supplemental oxygen, nasopharyngeal tube or oral airway placement, continuous positive airway pressure or brief bag valve mask ventilation. Eleven (1.7%) had apnea requiring continuous positive airway pressure or bag valve mask ventilation briefly. One patient had bradycardia that resolved with nasopharyngeal tube placement and continuous positive airway pressure. Fifteen (2.3%) patients had hypotension requiring adjustment of the sedation drip but no fluid bolus.

In a second analysis, pairs of ECMO and non-ECMO patients, matched by severity of disease and respiratory diagnosis, were compared. The use of ECMO (p = .0082), but not the use of high-frequency ventilation, was associated with a reduction in mortality. Other factors independently associated with mortality included oxygenation index (p < .0001), Pediatric Risk of Mortality score (PRISM) (p < .0001) and the Paco2 (p = .045). In 53 diagnosis- and risk-matched pairs, there was a significantly lower mortality rate (26.4% vs. 47.2%; p < .01) in the ECMO-treated patients. When all patients were stratified into mortality risk quartiles on the basis of oxygenation index and PRISM score, the proportion of deaths among ECMO-treated patients in the 50% to 75% mortality risk quartile was less than half the proportion in the non-ECMO treated patients (28.6% vs. 71.4% p < .05)> No effect was seen in the other quartiles.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The use of ECMO was associated with an improved survival in pediatric patients with respiratory failure. The lack of association of outcome with treatment in the ECMO-capable hospital or with another tertiary technology (i.e. high-frequency ventilation) suggests that ECMO itself was responsible for the improved outcome.

Although the importance and impact of lung-protective ventilation is widely appreciated and well established, the concept of diaphragm-protective ventilation has recently emerged as a potential complementary therapeutic strategy. This Perspective, developed from discussions at a meeting of international experts convened by PLUG (the Pleural Pressure Working Group) of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, outlines a conceptual framework for an integrated lung- and diaphragm-protective approach to mechanical ventilation on the basis of growing evidence about mechanisms of injury. We propose targets for diaphragm protection based on respiratory effort and patient-ventilator synchrony. The potential for conflict between diaphragm protection and lung protection under certain conditions is discussed; we emphasize that when conflicts arise, lung protection must be prioritized over diaphragm protection. Monitoring respiratory effort is essential to concomitantly protect both the diaphragm and the lung during mechanical ventilation. To implement lung- and diaphragm-protective ventilation, new approaches to monitoring, to setting the ventilator, and to titrating sedation will be required. Adjunctive interventions, including extracorporeal life support techniques, phrenic nerve stimulation, and clinical decision-support systems, may also play an important role in selected patients in the future. Evaluating the clinical impact of this new paradigm will be challenging, owing to the complexity of the intervention. The concept of lung- and diaphragm-protective ventilation presents a new opportunity to potentially improve clinical outcomes for critically ill patients."

Instead of redeploying pediatric providers to work with internist-led teams throughout a medical center, pediatric physicians and nurses organized and staffed a 40-bed adult COVID-19 treatment unit within a children's hospital. We adapted internal medicine protocols, developed screening criteria to select appropriate patients for admission, and reorganized staffing and equipment to accommodate adult patients with COVID-19. We used patient counts and descriptive statistics to report sociodemographic, system, and clinical outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The median patient age was 46 years; 69% were male. On admission, 78 (78%) required oxygen supplementation. During hospitalization, 13 (13%) eventually were intubated. Of the first 100 patients, 14 are still admitted to a medical unit, 6 are in the intensive care unit, 74 have been discharged, 4 died after transfer to the intensive care unit, and 2 died on the unit. The median length of stay for discharged or deceased patients was 4 days (IQR 2, 7).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our pediatric team screened, admitted, and cared for hospitalized adults by leveraging the familiarity of our system, adaptability of our staff, and high-quality infrastructure. This experience may be informative for other healthcare systems that will be redeploying pediatric providers and nurses to address a regional COVID-19 surge elsewhere."

In vitro, nitric oxide (NO) effectively suppresses the ischemic induction of PAI-1. We aimed to investigate the effects of inhaled NO on PAI-1 expression in ALI in a rat model with and without hyperoxia.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Healthy adult rats were primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via an intraperitoneal challenge followed by a second dose of LPS given intratracheally to induce ALI (LPS group), whereas the control groups were given sterile saline. All groups were allocated to subgroups according to gas exposure: NO (20 parts per million, NO), 95% oxygen (O), both (ONO), or room air (A). At 4h, 24h, 48h (after 4h or 24h exposure to the various gases, 24h gas intervention and then observation until 48h), the rat lungs were processed and PAI-1 protein and mRNA expression, histopathological lung injury scores and fibrin deposition were evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At 4 and 24h, inhaled NO caused the PAI-1 mRNA levels in the LPS-NO and LPS-ONO subgroups to decrease compared with the untreated LPS subgroups. At 48h, higher PAI-1 mRNA levels than those of the corresponding control subgroup were only observed in the LPS-O subgroup, and these values were lower in the LPS-ONO subgroup than in the LPS-O subgroup. The trends of the PAI-1 protein levels mirrored those of PAI-1 mRNA. At 48h, PAI-1 protein levels in the LPS-NO and LPS-ONO subgroups were decreased compared with those in the untreated LPS subgroups. The histopathological lung injury scores and fibrin deposition in LPS subgroups that inhaled NO showed a decreasing trend compared with the untreated LPS subgroups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Inhaled NO can suppress elevated PAI-1 expression in rats with ALI induced by endotoxin.

This leads to a high rate of intoxications with these products in children (5% of all pediatric intoxications, 25% of all lethal intoxications). Clinical courses, pathophysiology, and therapy of these intoxications are referred and studied.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Based on a literature review and 3 cases reports with different clinical courses, intoxications with volatile hydrocarbons are analyzed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The inhalation of volatile hydrocarbons causes an ARDS. This explains the high mortality. Early oxygen-treatment with PEEP-ventilation, however, facilitates a favourable outcome without residual defects as we demonstrate in one case. Another patient needs prolonged ventilatory support after a delayed start of therapy. A third patient cannot be saved even with ECMO.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Initial pulmonary symptoms after hydrocarbon intoxication, such as coughing and cyanosis, are signs for a severe course. Immediate hospitalization with repetitive chest x-rays and adequate instant therapy are the only option to reduce the high mortality of this intoxication."

            "abstract": "The use of pulse oximetry in the pediatric and neonatal intensive care units has grown tremendously in recent years. Opinions about this growth are divergent. Arriving at a generalized statement about the accuracy of pulse oximeters is difficult, but it has generally been found to be acceptably accurate in most patient populations under most conditions. However, there are limitations to its application. Pulse oximetry accuracy can be adversely affected by elevated levels of certain abnormal hemoglobin varieties as well as motion artifact and low peripheral perfusion. Some authors suggest a caveat against the use of pulse oximetry to prevent hyperoxemia in the neonatal population, whereas others suggest it is an important advancement. The affect of the use of pulse oximetry on respiratory morbidity and mortality has not been established, and suggestions that all mechanically ventilated patients should be continuously monitored are unsubstantiated."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Methemoglobinemia results from oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron within the hemoglobin molecule. This molecule cannot bind oxygen and increases the affinity of normal hemoglobin for oxygen, which results in decreased oxygen offloading in peripheral tissues. At elevated levels, methemoglobinemia can cause dyspnea, cyanosis, and even death. Common local anesthesia agents have been correlated with methemoglobinemia. Bronchoscopy is a commonly performed clinical procedure which uses topical application of these anesthetics to provide patient comfort. Methylene blue is an agent thought to help reverse the effects of methemoglobinemia by facilitating the methemoglobin reductase system.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using multiple search engines including PubMed and the Cochrane Database, available data on cases of methemoglobinemia after bronchoscopy were pooled. Adult and pediatric cases were considered.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eleven cases were identified. Cases occurred from 1977 until present. Data gathering was complicated by the fact that a consistent reporting system was not used across cases. Arterial blood gas data and CO-oximetry reported levels of methemoglobin were reported where available. No patients died from methemoglobinemia. The most common finding across all patients was decreased peripheral oxygen saturation. Cyanosis was also frequently reported. There was a disparity between the low peripheral oxygen saturation which was reported and the pO(2) on the arterial blood gas. Dose and type of anesthetic agent varied widely across studies.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Using topical anesthetic during bronchoscopy appears relatively safe. No fatalities from methemoglobinemia after bronchoscopy have been reported. A high suspicion for methemoglobinemia is required in patients who develop hypoxia or cyanosis postprocedurally. Access to CO-oximetry can confirm the diagnosis but the clinical picture is often sufficient to proceed with methylene blue treatment or observation, based on how severely the patient is affected. Patients who return to baseline can be considered for discharge home."

The timing of each closed endotracheal tube suctioning event was accurately identified from video recordings. We extracted systemic oxygen saturation, cerebral regional oxygen saturation, somatic regional (renal) oxygen saturation, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure for 5 minutes before and 5 minutes after each event and used these data for analysis. One-minute average values of these variables were used for repeated-measures analysis. We analyzed 287 endotracheal tube suctioning episodes in 19 children.

            "abstract": "Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is used as a surrogate for measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) but its determination requires that intracranial pressure be directly measured. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can noninvasively measure tissue oxygenation. We hypothesized that NIRS would correlate well with CBF, with cerebral metabolism of oxygen (CMRO2) and glucose and with lactate production as CPP was reduced. Seven anesthetized piglets were subjected to reductions in CPP to 60, 50, 40, 30, and 20 mmHg by infusing an artificial cerebral spinal fluid into the lateral ventricle of the brain. After a period of equilibration, NIRS over the left temporal cortex and regional CBF (microspheres) were measured at each CPP level as well as arterial and internal jugular PaO2 , glucose, and lactate. CMRO2 and glucose consumption and lactate production were calculated by standard formulae. NIRS correlated very well (P < 0.05) with CBF in the left temporal cortex [mean r (95% CI) = 0.95 (0.91-0.99)] and with left hemispheric CMRO2 [0.94 (0.90-0.98)], glucose consumption [0.87 (0.76-0.97)], and lactate production [0.89 (0.81-0.97)]. The correlation of NIRS with CBF was slightly better (P < 0.05) than that of CPP with CBF [0.89 (0.84-0.94)]. In this model of global cerebral hypertension, NIRS correlated well with CBF and measures of cerebral metabolism, and might be useful as a surrogate for CPP. Further studies are warranted to determine if NIRS is associated with these variables in focal cerebral injury."

            "abstract": "While transcutaneous continuous monitoring of partial pressure of oxygen (TcPO2) is a proven valuable diagnostic tool in intensive care of sick neonates, its use in older children is less well defined. The purpose of this study is to establish the accuracy and reliability of TcPO2 as a reflection of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) in critically ill pediatric patients. Twenty-six children, age ranging from 4 days to 13 years, were studied. The main diagnostic categories were cardiac 54 per cent, respiratory 27 per cent, gastrointestinal 15 per cent, and neurologic 4 per cent. Forty three estimations of PaO2 (by radial arterial sampling) and TcPO2 (by cutaneous monitor) were obtained simultaneously. Their correlation coefficient, regression equation, and confidence limits were calculated by standard statistical methods with the aid of a microcomputer. Our data show that the high degree of correlation between TcPO2 and PaO2 is highly significant (r = 0.90, p less than 0.001) for the full range of PaO2 between 0 to 200 mm Hg. At the lower range of PaO2 (0-79 mm Hg), the degree of correlation (r = 0.91, p less than 0.001) is better than that (r = 0.77, p less than 0.001) at the higher range (80-200 mm Hg), although the difference between the two correlation coefficients is not significant (p greater than 0.05). It is important to note that TcPO2 consistently underestimates the PaO2 and the 95% confidence limits are rather wide. We conclude that TcPO2 is a reasonably accurate reflection of PaO2 in critically ill pediatric patients. Its main advantage is in predicting and showing trends in tissue oxygenation by noninvasive means. However, when critical assessment of the degree of hypoxemia is required, TcPO2 is no substitute for PaO2."

Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated via survival analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      High-flow nasal oxygen therapy and CPAP did not alter the need for mechanical ventilation after extubation (aHR 0.47, 95% CI 0.15-1.48 and 0.96, 95% CI 0.35-2.62, respectively) but did reduce the risk of reintubation (aHR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06-0.57 and 0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.72, respectively). PICU length of stay was 11, 18 and 37 days for CPAP, HFNT and historical CPAP and mortality was 12%, 7% and 27%, respectively. There was no effect on the duration of sedative infusions.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      High-flow nasal oxygen therapy provided effective support for some children, but larger studies in resource-constrained settings are needed."

Our objective was to determine whether the use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in severe septic shock was associated with altered patient mortality, morbidity, and/or length of ICU and hospital stay when compared with conventional therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      International multicenter, retrospective cohort study using prospectively collected data of children admitted to intensive care with a diagnosis of severe septic shock between the years 2006 and 2014.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Tertiary PICUs in Australia, New Zealand, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States.\n    \n\n\n          Patients:\n        \n      \n      Children greater than 30 days old and less than 18 years old.\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      None.\n    \n\n\n          Measurements and main results:\n        \n      \n      Of 2,452 children with a diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock, 164 patients met the inclusion criteria for severe septic shock. With conventional therapy (n = 120), survival to hospital discharge was 40%. With venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 44), survival was 50% (p = 0.25; CI, -0.3 to 0.1). In children who suffered an in-hospital cardiac arrest, survival to hospital discharge was 18% with conventional therapy and 42% with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Δ = 24%; p = 0.02; CI, 2.5-42%). Survival was significantly higher in patients who received high extracorporeal membrane oxygenation flows of greater than 150 mL/kg/min compared with children who received standard extracorporeal membrane oxygenation flows or no extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (82%, 43%, and 48%; p = 0.03; CI, 0.1-0.7 and p < 0.01; CI, 0.2-0.7, respectively).

The European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) have developed guidelines for the use of noninvasive respiratory support techniques in the hypoxaemic patient in the peri-operative and periprocedural period. The panel outlined five clinical questions regarding treatment with noninvasive respiratory support techniques [conventional oxygen therapy (COT), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)] for hypoxaemic patients with acute peri-operative/periprocedural respiratory failure. The goal was to assess the available literature on the various noninvasive respiratory support techniques, specifically studies that included adult participants with hypoxaemia in the peri-operative/periprocedural period. The literature search strategy was developed by a Cochrane Anaesthesia and Intensive Care trial search specialist in close collaboration with the panel members and the ESA group methodologist. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the level of evidence and to grade recommendations. The final process was then validated by both ESA and ESICM scientific committees. Among 19 recommendations, the two grade 1B recommendations state that in the peri-operative/periprocedural hypoxaemic patient, the use of either NIPPV or CPAP (based on local expertise) is preferred to COT for improvement of oxygenation; and that the panel suggests using NIPPV or CPAP immediately postextubation for hypoxaemic patients at risk of developing acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery."

Children treated with inhaled nitric oxide were more likely to have a primary diagnosis of pneumonia (72% vs 54.8%; p < 0.001), had a higher initial oxygenation index (median 16.9 [interquartile range, 10.1-27.3] vs 8.5 [interquartile range, 5.8-12.2]; p < 0.001), and had a higher 72-hour maximal Vasoactive-Inotrope Score (median 15 [interquartile range, 6-25] vs 8 [interquartile range, 0-17.8]; p < 0.001) than those not receiving inhaled nitric oxide. Mortality was higher in the inhaled nitric oxide treatment group (25.2% vs 16.3%; p = 0.02), and children in this group had fewer 28-day ventilator-free days (10 d [interquartile range, 0-18 d] vs 17 d (interquartile range 5.5-22 d]; p < 0.0001). We matched 176 children based on propensity score for inhaled nitric oxide treatment. In the matched cohort, inhaled nitric oxide treatment was not associated with mortality (odds ratio, 1.3 [95% CI, 0.56-3.0]) or 28-day ventilator-free days (incidence rate ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.80-1.04]). These results remained consistent in the entire study cohort when the propensity score for inhaled nitric oxide treatment was used for either inverse probability weighting or stratification in regression modeling with the exception that subjects treated with inhaled nitric oxide were more likely to have 0 ventilator-free days (p ≤ 0.02). In secondary analysis stratified by oxygenation response, inhaled nitric oxide treatment was not associated with mortality or 28-day ventilator-free days in children with a positive oxygenation response (all p > 0.2) CONCLUSIONS:: Treatment with inhaled nitric oxide in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome is not associated with improvement in either mortality or ventilator-free days and may be associated with harm. Further prospective trials are required to define the role of inhaled nitric oxide treatment in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome."

            "abstract": "We report that the pediatric cardiogenic shock and septic shock populations show similar hemodynamic and oxygen utilization physiologic relationships during aggressive intensive care therapy. We examined the mathematical relationships between vascular tone and flow, and oxygen utilization and oxygen delivery (DO2) in the early and middle stages of cardiogenic and septic shock. The fitted curves between cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance, and oxygen consumption (VO2) and DO2 were clinically and statistically similar in both shock populations. We found no evidence for decreased oxygen extraction in sepsis as compared to the cardiogenic shock population. In addition, it appears that the major determinant of VO2 in these populations is DO2, not oxygen extraction. We suggest that patients with cardiogenic or septic shock can be treated according to similar physiologic principles."

Such obstacles to smooth retrieval included administrative difficulties, mistakes in management, and unresolved acute severe physiologic derangements in the child. Three hundred ninety-four problems were found: 24% were preventable by improved education of referring doctors; these included unrecognized needs for ventilatory support, added oxygen, chest x-ray or nasogastric tube, and difficulties with airway selection, placement, and care. Twenty-eight percent were preventable by better PETS organization, education, protocols, or telephone checklists; examples include equipment problems and clinical derangements unrecognized at referral. Difficulties owing to conditions of transport (eg. vibration, dysbarism, and air turbulence) were uncommon (five percent of patients). Regular reviews of performance of all PET services, combined with measures to educate referring doctors, can improve patient outcome."

Fifteen children (6 weeks-28 months of age) with complex congenital heart disease and/or respiratory failure who received opioids and benzodiazepines for 4 days or greater were evaluated for withdrawal symptoms using a standardized assessment tool. Thirteen children showed moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms a median 3 days after commencement of tapering. Symptom intensity was not related to prior opioid or benzodiazepine exposure, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy or length of tapering. Children who received fentanyl in addition to morphine more often exhibited signs of withdrawal. This study demonstrated that significant withdrawal symptoms occur in critically ill children even with the use of a standardised assessment tool and tapering management protocol. The predictive validity and utility of the Opioid and Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Score (OBWS) was adequate for clinical use, but areas for further improvement of the tool were identified. Problems with the clinical withdrawal prevention and management guidelines were also identified. More research is needed to establish the optimal methods for prevention and management of iatrogenic opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal in paediatric critical care."

We tested the null hypothesis that TH does not improve hyperoxic lung injury in neonatal rats. The prospective, randomized study was set at Research laboratory in Children's Hospital. Forty-five newborn rats were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 15/group), and exposed to 96 h of normoxia (FiO(2) = 0.21), hyperoxia (FiO(2) > 0.98), and TH (FiO(2) = 0.95, FiCO(2) = 0.05). Lung histology, wet-weight to dry-weight ratio, and concentrations of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10) were used to evaluate pulmonary damage. Using a scale of 0-4, the total scores for lungs hypercellularity, inflammation, and hemorrhage was significantly increased from a median value of 1.5 in normoxia to 2.5 in hyperoxia (P < 0.05) and 3.0 with TH (P < 0.001, nonparametric ANOVA). The interstitial space relative to the alveolar space, as a measure of hypercellularity, was increased by 18% during hyperoxia and by 44% with TH compared with normoxia. TH significantly increased the size of the interstitial space by 22% compared with hyperoxia (P < 0.001). The lung wet-weight to dry-weight ratio was increased by 10% in both hyperoxic groups (P < 0.001). Both hyperoxic groups showed significant reductions in the concentration of IL-1beta compared with normoxia (P < 0.001), whereas the ratio of IL-1beta to IL-10 was significantly decreased, indicating an anti-inflammatory trend. TH does not prevent histological manifestations of hyperoxic lung injury in spontaneously breathing neonatal rats and may worsen the outcome."

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that post-resuscitation hyperoxia and hypocapnia are associated with increased mortality after resuscitation in pediatric patients.\n## METHODS\nWe performed a prospective observational multicenter hospital-based study including 223 children aged between 1 month and 18 years who achieved return of spontaneous circulation after in-hospital cardiac arrest and for whom arterial blood gas analysis data were available.\n## RESULTS\nAfter return of spontaneous circulation, 8.5% of patients had hyperoxia (defined as PaO(2)>300 mm Hg) and 26.5% hypoxia (defined as PaO(2)<60 mm Hg). No statistical differences in mortality were observed when patients with hyperoxia (52.6%), hypoxia (42.4%), or normoxia (40.7%) (p=0.61). Hypocapnia (defined as PaCO(2)<30 mm Hg) was observed in 13.5% of patients and hypercapnia (defined as PaCO(2)>50 mm Hg) in 27.6%. Patients with hypercapnia or hypocapnia had significantly higher mortality (59.0% and 50.0%, respectively) than patients with normocapnia (33.1%) (p=0.002). At 24h after return of spontaneous circulation, neither PaO(2) nor PaCO(2) values were associated with mortality. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that hypercapnia (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.62-6.61; p=0.001) and hypocapnia (OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.04-7.05; p=0.04) after return of spontaneous circulation were significant mortality factors.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn children resuscitated from cardiac arrest, hyperoxemia after return of spontaneous circulation or 24h later was not associated with mortality. On the other hand, hypercapnia and hypocapnia were associated with higher mortality than normocapnia.\n"

However, ECMO requires clinical teams to engage in many ethical considerations. Even with ongoing improvements in technology and expertise, some patients will not survive a course of ECMO. An unsuccessful course of ECMO can be difficult to accept and cause a great deal of angst. These questions can result in real conflict both within the care team, and between the care team and the family. Herein we explore a range of ethical considerations that may be encountered when caring for a patient on ECMO, with a particular focus on those courses where it appears likely that the patient will not survive.

Data about feasibly and safety of pediatric ECMO transport are scarce. Our aim is to describe our experience with a pediatric ECMO reach-out program and review pertinent literature. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected retrospectively from the charts of all patients cannulated onto ECMO at referring centers and transported to our center from 2003 to 2018. Similar data were recorded for patients who were referred for ECMO support from within the hospital. The cohort included 80 patients cannulated at 17 referring centers. The transport team included a senior pediatric cardiac surgeon and an ECMO specialist. All transfers but one were done by special emergency medical service ambulance. No major complications or deaths occurred during transport, and all patients were stable upon arrival to our unit. Mortality was lower in the ECMO reach-out cohort than in-house patients referred for ECMO support. This is the first study from Israel and one of the largest to date describing a dedicated pediatric ECMO transport program. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation transport appears to be feasible and safe when conducted by a small, highly skilled mobile team. Successful reach-out program requires open communication between the referring physician and the accepting center.

The median age was 4.83 yrs. The median duration of ECLS was 9 days, with 19.5 days in the pediatric ICU and 23.5 days for the entire hospital length of stay. The observed mortality rate for these patients was 20%. Median predicted mortality rate based on the Pediatric Respiratory Failure score calculation was 83%. The hospital charges incurred by these patients was a median of $199,096. Based on a normal life expectancy for survivors, this results in a cost of $4,190/life-year.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      ECLS for the pediatric patient with AHRF is done at a considerable cost. However, ECLS affects survival favorably, and compares favorably when considering cost/life-year calculations. The data presented in this study may serve as a benchmark for comparison with newer therapies (i.e., liquid ventilation, nitric oxide). These data also provide a framework for cost-based analyses at other ECLS institutions."

            "abstract": "Single-lumen cannula venovenous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a special extracorporeal life support (ECLS) technique used for neonatal and pediatric refractory hypoxemia. This is an alternative flow rate ECLS that consists of successive clamping on the drainage and the injection lines. Currently, the Armand-Trousseau's pediatric intensive care unit remains the only pediatric ECMO center proposing this partial assistance. This article details a technical note and a retrospective analysis of our experience in refractory hypoxemia. The retrospective study, from 2007 to 2011, included all pediatric and neonatal patients treated by single-lumen cannula VV ECMO. The study was focused on pre-ECMO patient characteristics and complications during ECMO course. During the last 5 years, 67 pediatric patients were assisted by this single-lumen cannula VV ECMO. Sixty-one patients (91%) were newborns. Thirty-nine patients presented with meconium aspiration syndrome (58%), which was the most frequent etiology. Before cannulation, mean oxygenation index (OI) was 32 ± 11, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference was 604 ± 47 mm Hg, and partial pressure arterial oxygen/fraction inspired oxygen ratio was 59.2 ± 35.8. Forty-eight patients (72%) presented pulmonary hypertension, and 66 patients were treated by nitric oxide (98%). Fifty patients (75%) were treated by vasopressors or inotropic drugs. Average duration of ECMO was 13.2 ± 7.8 days. There were forty-six survivors (69%). The worst prognosis was for respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia. Complications like acute renal injury and hematologic and transfusion acts were not so different than those observed in classical ECMO techniques. Nevertheless, 19 patients presented a stroke (28% of the overall population), but this high rate did not seem to be due to the ECLS technique used. Single-lumen cannula VV ECMO is a partial and efficient ECMO support. Our experience shows that this technique is as efficient and less invasive than two cannulas ECMO. The single-lumen cannula VV ECMO is a simple and safe ECLS support used for neonatal or pediatric refractory hypoxemia. Because this is a partial assistance, it is a promising ECLS support."

Blood gas data were prospectively collected from 50 critically ill, mechanically ventilated children, 50 taken before and 40 after FiO2 change. Assessment of Qsp/Qt, P(A-a)O2, PaO2/FiO2, PaO2/PAO2, and P(A-a)O2/PaO2 was carried out before and after FiO2 change.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In first blood gas data, 31 patients were hypoxemic (PaO2 < 90 Torr), 10 were normal, and 9 were hyperoxemic (PaO2 > 100 Torr). Forty patients required FiO2 modifications that were carried out according to Maxwell's formula. Five children showed persistent oxygen disturbance after FiO2 changes. P(A-a)O2, PaO2/FiO2, PaO2/PAO2, and P(A-a)O2/PaO2 had sensitivities of 0.66, 0.71, 0.98, and 0.93, respectively, and specificities of 0.79, 0.91, 0.29, and 0.64, respectively, to detect pathological Qsp/Qt. All oxygen indices changed significantly after FiO2 modifications compared from initials; Qsp/Qt also showed significant change after FiO2 change. Pearson product-moment showed lineal correlation between each index, and Qsp/Qt demonstrated their significant correlation (p < 0.01). Correlation of Qsp/Qt and PaO2/FiO2 and PaO2/PAO2 was significantly higher in younger children (< 13 years) p < 0.05. The FiO2-required formula to obtain a desired PaO2 had a sensitivity of 0.93 and a specificity of 0.75.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The oxygen indices showed sufficient efficacy to detect pathological intrapulmonary shunt, and to have a statistically significant lineal correlation that permits its use during the clinical evaluation of oxygen transport data in most mechanically ventilated children, which is consistent with other reports on adult populations. However, one limitation for its use in clinical assessment, as reported in previous studies, would be that all indices in the present study are FiO2-dependent; therefore, when the FiO2 varies, the use is misleading. The FiO2-required formula is efficient for defining the appropriated FiO2 for the obtaining of the desired PaO2, but will always be merely a guide that should be confirmed through blood gas analysis."

The process of cuff deflation is innocuous in the normal subject, but the systemic and cerebral effects of cuff deflation in severely head-injured patients have not been studied. The purposes of this study were to examine the physiological effects of cuff deflation and to study their impact on the calculation of autoregulatory index (ARI).\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      In 24 severely head-injured patients, 388 thigh cuff deflations were analyzed. The physiological parameters were recorded before, during, and after a transient decrease in blood pressure.

MAP decreased by an average value of 19 +/- 5 mmHg. Initially the tracings for MAP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were nearly identical, but after 30 seconds, variable increases in intracranial pressure caused some differences between the MAP and CPP curves. The difference between the ARI values calculated twice using MAP as well as CPP was zero for 70% of left-sided studies and 73% for right-sided studies and less than or equal to 1 for 93% of left- and 95% of right-sided cuff deflations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Transient and relatively minor perturbations were detected in systemic physiology induced by dynamic testing of cerebral pressure autoregulation.

METHODS. SHFJV is the simultaneous application of low- and high-frequency jet ventilation performed using a specially designed ventilator. SHFJV versus conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) was were applied in three groups of patients. Group 1 (Gr 1) included patients without pulmonary insufficiency; group 2 (Gr 2) patients had moderate and those in group 3 (Gr 3) had severe pulmonary insufficiency. RESULTS. In Gr 1 and Gr 2, SHFJV was associated with a significant decrease in mean airway pressure (mPAW 12.9 vs. 13.3 mm Hg, P < 0.05). In Gr 3 oxygenation was significantly better with SHFJV (mean paO2 140.1 vs. 109.9 mm Hg, P < 0.05; mean FiO2 0.66 vs. 0.86, P < 0.05).

Intrapulmonary shunt fractions showed a significant decrease with SHFJV (24.6 vs. 34.4, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. Significant differences were observed primarily in Gr 3 patients, indicating that patients with severe pulmonary insufficiency may benefit from SHFJV.

We measured effort of breathing using esophageal manometry with pressure-rate product (PRP) on all 3 modes. NIMV synchrony was determined by comparing patient efforts (esophageal manometry) with mechanically delivered breaths (spirometry in ventilator circuit). On NIMV, PRP and synchrony was also measured after adding a nasal clip on 26 patients.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Forty-two children were included. Median (IQR) age was 2 (0.5, 4) months. There was no difference in median PRP between HFNC 6 liters per minute, 355 (270,550), NIMV 12/5 cm H2O, 341 (235, 472), and NCPAP 5 cm H2O, 340 (245,506) (P?=?.33). Results were similar regardless of HFNC flow rate or NIMV inspiratory pressure. Median PRP on CPAP of 5 cm H2O prior to extubation 255 (176, 375) was significantly lower than all postextubation values (P?<?.002). On NIMV, less than 50% of patient efforts resulted in a ventilator breath, which was not improved with a nasal clip (P?>?.07)). However, as NIMV synchrony improved (>60%), PRP on NIMV was lower than on HFNC.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      For infants, effort of breathing is similar on HFNC, NIMV, and NCPAP after extubation, regardless of flow rate or inspiratory pressure.

This experiment sought to compare the Medtronic 0800 silicon rubber membrane oxygenator to the Quadrox-iD Pediatric oxygenator in the conventional roller pump circuit, as well as comparing the conventional circuit to an alternative circuit. Three circuits were set up in the experiment. Two conventional roller pump circuits were used to compare the two oxygenators and an alternative circuit consisting of the Quadrox-iD Pediatric oxygenator and Maquet Rotaflow centrifugal pump system was used to identify differences between circuits. All three circuits were primed with Lactated Ringers' solution and human blood, with an hematocrit of 40%. Testing occurred at flow rates of 250, 500, and 750 ml/ min at 37°C for mean arterial line pressures of 60, 80, and 100 mmHg. The results of the experiment showed lower pressure drops and greater retention of total hemodynamic energy (THE) across the Quadrox-iD Pediatric oxygenator compared to the Medtronic 0800 oxygenator. Furthermore, the centrifugal pump used in the alternative circuit showed no back flow at flow rates as low as 250 ml/min while, on the other hand, rpm levels were kept below 2200 for flow rates as high as 750 ml/min. Findings support the usage of the Quadrox-iD Pediatric oxygenator in a circuit utilizing the Maquet Rotaflow centrifugal pump system due to lower pressure drops and greater percentage of THE retained across the circuit. Additional advantages of the alternative circuit include rapid set-up time, easy transport, lower priming volumes, and no gravity-dependent venous drainage system so that it can be situated in close proximity to and at the level of the patient."

            "abstract": "Maintenance of patency in distal airways is essential for gas exchange in neonatal life, and its disruption may have long-lasting effects on respiratory function. However, neural mechanisms that regulate caliber of intrapulmonary airways during early postnatal life, and their disruption by hyperoxic exposure, have not been well characterized. We have previously shown that cholinergically mediated airway contractile responses in rat pups are upregulated after hyperoxic exposure, and that increased expression of neuropeptides, such as substance P, may be contributory. More recently, we have documented impairment of neurally mediated airway relaxation in response to hyperoxic stress associated with loss of nitric oxide and prostaglandin-induced airway relaxation as well as inhibition of long chain myosin phosphatase. Our most recent data demonstrate significantly enhanced expression of the neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high affinity specific tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) receptor in hyperoxia-exposed airway smooth muscle. The existence of a BDNF-TrkB receptor autocrine and paracrine loops in the airways provides a basis for understanding local regulatory mechanisms of airway homeostasis. A mechanistic role for BDNF-TrkB signaling in hyperoxia-induced airway hyperreactivity in early postnatal life could serve to modulate both afferent and efferent neural pathways that result in enhanced contractile responses of immature airways exposed to hyperoxic stress. Greater insight into these neural pathways may lead to future preventive strategies for preterm infants surviving neonatal intensive care and developing chronic lung disease."

Nonsurvivors had significantly higher proportion of AKI at ICU admission (OR: 2.59, p = 0.04) and fluid accumulation on ECMO day 1 (9% vs. 1%, p = 0.05) compared with survivors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis (adjusted for a propensity score based on nonrenal factors associated with increased mortality) demonstrated that fluid accumulation on ECMO day 1 is significantly associated with increased ICU mortality (OR: 1.07, p = 0.04). Fluid accumulation within the first 24 hours after ECMO cannulation is significantly associated with increased ICU mortality in neonatal and pediatric patients.

Twenty hours of continuous recordings were made of heart rate, respiratory rate, and TcPo2 in the first five days after birth. Personnel caring for the control infants were blind to the TcPo2 measurements. Those caring for the experimental group were instructed in the operation of the TcPo2 monitor and used the device to modify the timing and extent of procedures to minimize \"undersirable time\" (TcPo2 less than 40 or greater than 100 torr). Control group infants had an average of 40 min/20 hr in \"undesirable time.\" When personnel used TcPo2 monitoring to modify care this \"undesirable time\" was reduced to 6 min/20 hr. This difference was statistically significant (P less than .001). Infants in the control group were handled more frequently, and experienced more hypoxemia. Of the hypoxemic time suffered by the control infants 75% was associated with handling. Only 5% of the hypoxemia or hyperoxemia was detected by blood Pao2 analysis or conventional monitors. Intermittent arterial blood gas sampling is an inadequate method for monitoring arterial oxygenation in low-birth-weight infants since hypoxemia and hyperoxemia are often missed. Continuous TcPo2 monitoring improves care by diminishing \"undesirable time.\""

Five were admitted from the emergency department and two from the ward. The Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 3 (range, 0-9), and Pediatric Risk of Mortality II score was 4 (range, 0-16). All children were previously healthy except one (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation). Respiratory symptoms and fever were prevalent. A chest radiograph led to a pneumonia diagnosis. Not all patients presented with lymphopenia on admission. D-Dimer and ferritin were elevated. All patients needed oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula; five patients received high-flow nasal cannula therapy, which was later substituted with noninvasive ventilation in four.

            "title": "Arterial desaturation during exercise in man: implication for O2 uptake and work capacity.",
            "abstract": "Exercise-induced arterial hypoxaemia is defined as a reduction in the arterial O2 pressure (PaO2) by more than 1 kPa and/or a haemoglobin O2 saturation (SaO2) below 95%. With blood gas analyses ideally reported at the actual body temperature, desaturation is a consistent finding during maximal ergometer rowing. Arterial desaturation is most pronounced at the end of a maximal exercise bout, whereas the reduction in PaO2 is established from the onset of exercise. Exercise-induced arterial hypoxaemia is multifactorial. The ability to maintain a high alveolar O2 pressure (PAO2) is critical for blood oxygenation and this appears to be difficult in large individuals. A large lung capacity and, in turn, diffusion capacity seem to protect PaO2. A widening of the PAO2-PaO2 difference does indicate that a diffusion limitation, a ventilation-perfusion mismatch and/or a shunt influence the transport of O2 from alveoli to the pulmonary capillaries. An inspired O2 fraction of 0.30 reduces the widened PAO2-PaO2 difference by 75% and prevents a reduction of PaO2 and SaO2. With a marked increase in cardiac output, diffusion limitation combined with a fast transit time dominates the O2 transport problem. Furthermore, a postexercise reduction in pulmonary diffusion capacity suggests that the alveolo-capillary membrane is affected. An antioxidant attenuates oxidative burst by neutrophilic granulocytes, but it does not affect PaO2, SaO2 or O2 uptake (VO2), and the ventilatory response to maximal exercise also remains the same. It is proposed, though, that increased concentration of certain cytokines correlates to exercise-induced hypoxaemia as cytokines stimulate mast cells and basophilic granulocytes to degranulate histamine. The basophil count increases during maximal rowing. Equally, histamine release is associated with hypoxaemia and when the release of histamine is prevented, the reduction in PaO2 is attenuated. During maximal exercise, an extreme lactate spill-over to blood allows pH decrease to below 7.1 and according to the O2 dissociation curve this is critical for SaO2. When infusion of sodium bicarbonate maintains a stable blood buffer capacity, acidosis is attenuated and SaO2 increases from 89% to 95%. This enables exercise capacity to increase, an effect also seen when O2 supplementation to inspired air restores arterial oxygenation. In that case, exercise capacity increases less than can be explained by VO2 and CaO2. Furthermore, the change in muscle oxygenation during maximal exercise is not affected when hyperoxia and sodium bicarbonate attenuate desaturation. It is proposed that other organs benefit from enhanced O2 availability, and especially the brain appears to increase its oxygenation during maximal exercise with hyperoxia."

Of these, there were 98 patients who had 99 unique encounters for renal replacement therapy that met eligibility criteria for analysis. The most common diagnoses were respiratory failure, stem cell transplant, and sepsis. The overall mortality was 55.6%. Nonsurvivors had a lower ICU admission weight compared with survivors (30.0 kg vs 44.0 kg; p = 0.037) and a higher degree of fluid accumulation at the time of renal replacement therapy initiation (17.1% vs 8.1%; p = 0.021). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 7.22; 95% CI, 1.88-27.7), a longer duration of stage 3 acute kidney injury (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.15), and higher fluid balance in the 72 hours after initiating renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.20) were associated with an increased odds of mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Earlier renal replacement therapy initiation with respect to the development of severe acute kidney injury was associated with lower mortality in this cohort of critically ill children. Additionally, invasive mechanical ventilation at the time of renal replacement therapy initiation and a higher degree of fluid accumulation after initiating renal replacement therapy were associated with increased mortality."

            "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      Despite declining mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome is still involved in up to one third of pediatric intensive care deaths. The recently convened Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference has outlined research priorities for the field, which include the need for accurate bedside risk stratification of patients. We aimed to develop a simple yet robust model of mortality risk among pediatric patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome to facilitate the targeted application of high-risk investigational therapies and stratification for enrollment in clinical trials.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      Prospective, multicenter cohort.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Five academic PICUs.\n    \n\n\n          Patients:\n        \n      \n      Three hundred eight children greater than 1 month and less than or equal to 18 years old, admitted to the ICU, with bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph and PaO2/FIO2 ratio less than 300 in the clinical absence of left atrial hypertension.\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      None.\n    \n\n\n          Measurements and main results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty clinical variables were recorded in the following six categories: demographics, medical history, oxygenation, ventilation, radiographic imaging, and multiple organ dysfunction. Data were measured 0-24 and 48-72 hours after acute respiratory distress syndrome onset (day 1 and 3) and examined for associations with hospital mortality. Among 308 enrolled patients, mortality was 17%. Children with a history of cancer and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplant had higher mortality (47% vs 11%; p < 0.001). Oxygenation index, the PaO2/FIO2 ratio, extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, Pediatric Risk of Mortality-3, and positive cumulative fluid balance were each associated with mortality. Using two statistical approaches, we found that a parsimonious model of mortality risk using only oxygenation index and cancer/hematopoietic stem cell transplant history performed as well as other more complex models that required additional variables.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In the PICU, oxygenation index and cancer/hematopoietic stem cell transplant history can be used on acute respiratory distress syndrome day 1 or day 3 to predict hospital mortality without the need for more complex models.

The following study was undertaken to analyze characteristics of UEE and develop prevention strategies.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A retrospective cohort study on a level III single center NICU was undertaken. Patient records of a 12-month period from December 2003 to December 2004 were analyzed using a standardized evaluation form. Fischer's exact t-test and the Mann-Whitney U-Ranked Sum test were used for statistical analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One hundred and four neonates with a total ventilation time of 14 495 h were included in this study. Of these patients 12 UEE were observed (1 UEE/1208 h of ventilation time). Neither median birth weight [1445 g (range 460-4650) vs 1755 g (range 460-3570 g)] nor median gestational age [31.5 weeks (range 25.6-39.6 weeks) vs 32.7 weeks (range 23.9-41.5 weeks)] differed significantly between neonates with UEE compared with the total group. When the UEE occurred, the neonates were cared for by experienced nursing staff with a median of 10 years nursing experience. The workload for the individual nurse was high: during shifts when UEE happened, each nurse had to take care of 3.85 patients (range 1.8-5 patients). This workload was higher than the average of 3 (range 1.6-6) patients/nurse during the study period. The most frequently reported reason for UEE was difficult fixation of the tracheal tube (TT) (four patients), followed by handling of the infant by nursing staff or physiotherapy (two patients) or an active infant in whom dislocation of the TT occurred without external manipulations (three patients). In three instances, the reason for the UEE was not documented. Of the 12 UEE observed in 10 patients, three required immediate reintubation, five were managed with nasal continuous positive airway pressure and four did not require further respiratory support. Of those who required support, FiO(2) increased by 14% over baseline compared with the FiO(2) prior to UEE.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Inadequate TT fixation could be identified as the main contributor to UEE and should be targeted in prevention strategies. The reintubation rate after UEE was only 25%. Overall, UEE did not result in an adverse outcome in terms of mortality. Length of stay on NICU was significantly longer in UEE patients."

            "abstract": "Several factors increase the difficulty and urgency of airway management in children in the emergency setting. Early and appropriate airway management are of prime importance in improving the outcome of such patients. The major decision points of airway management include one's assessment of the airway and ability to perform endotracheal intubation. If the airway is judged to be normal, oral endotracheal intubation following sedation and neuromuscular blockade is suggested. Rapid sequence intubation to prevent acid aspiration should be used. While the medications for airway management generally are administered intravenously, it should be kept in mind that intraosseous access is an acceptable alternative for the administration of several different agents, including those used for endotracheal intubation. If the airway cannot be secured following the administration of anesthetic and neuromuscular blocking agents, the ASA algorithm for the \"cannot intubate/cannot ventilate\" scenario should be followed (Figure). When the airway is judged to be abnormal, one of the above described awake techniques may be used. While there is ample literature concerning these techniques in adults, their use in children has been limited. Most importantly, considerable practice may be required to become and stay facile with many of these \"alternative techniques\" of airway management. In certain circumstances, surgical cricothyrotomy should be considered as an alternative to airway management. Regardless of the technique chosen, appropriate personnel and preparation are mandatory to ensure the safe and effective management of the airway in the pediatric trauma patient. Due to the various skills and expertise of different subspecialists, a multidisciplinary approach to such patients is recommended. Such an approach may include pediatricians, emergency room physicians, surgical subspecialists, anesthesiologists, and critical care physicians."

We conducted a retrospective single-center PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis of 34 pediatric intensive care unit patients who received MEM. Individual PK parameters were determined by a two-compartment analysis. The median (range) age and body weight were 1.4 (0.03 to 14.6) years and 8.9 (2.7 to 40.9) kg, respectively, and eight (23.5%) patients received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), three of whom received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Renal function, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) score for the clearance (CL), and the use of CRRT for the central volume of distribution (Vc) were identified as significant covariates. The mean CL, Vc, and peripheral volume of distribution (Vp) were 0.45 liters/kg/h, 0.49 liters/kg, and 0.34 liters/kg, respectively. The mean population CL of MEM increased by 35% in patients with SIRS and Vc increased by 66% in patients on CRRT in the final model. Dosing simulations suggested that the standard dosing regimen provided insufficient PD exposures of a 100% free time above the MIC, and higher doses (40 to 80 mg/kg of body weight/dose every 8 h) with a prolonged 3-h infusion were required to ensure the appropriate PD exposures for patients with SIRS. Our PK model indicated that critically ill pediatric patients are at risk of subtherapeutic exposure under the standard dosing regimen of MEM.

Subsequently, a significant survival benefit of a low tidal volume, high positive end expiratory pressure strategy on the ventilatory was found in adults. Investigation of the effects of inhaled nitric oxide in acute respiratory failure patients continues to show transient improvements in oxygenation, but no evidence of improved outcomes. The use of intratracheal surfactant within 24 hours of intubation in pediatric respiratory failure may be beneficial in reducing the days of mechanical ventilation. Neutrophil oxidative damage has been demonstrated, but therapies directed at decreasing neutrophil adherence have failed to demonstrate improvements.

The CAEC provided a means of a \"guided\" reintubation while maintaining the ability to provide supplemental oxygenation directly into the trachea.\n    \n\n\n          Measurements and main results:\n        \n      \n      The respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and amount of oxygen administered were measured immediately before extubation and at 5-, 15-, 30-, and 60-min intervals thereafter. In addition, the child's ability to tolerate the CAEC was noted and rated (0 = tolerable without difficulty, 1 = tolerable with difficulty, 2 = intolerable). No sedatives were administered in the presence of the CAEC. The duration of the CAEC placement was dependent on the satisfaction of the child's airway patency as determined by the unlikely need for reintubation. Five of the 20 (25%) children who had been extubated were reintubated in the intensive care unit with the assistance of the CAEC. Three of the five (60%) children were reintubated for upper airway obstruction. The ability to provide supplemental oxygen through the CAEC into the trachea during reintubation diminished the potential for hypoxia and maintained the ability to reintubate the trachea using the CAEC as a guidewire to pass an endotracheal tube.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In children with a known difficult airway who are at risk for a difficult reintubation, the CAEC is a useful tool for a trial of extubation in the intensive care unit."

            "abstract": "The concept of oxygen transport, defined as the relation between oxygen consumption (VO2) and delivery (DO2), is of fundamental importance in critically ill patients. The past 200 years have witnessed a stepwise progressive improvement in the understanding of pathophysiological disturbances in the balance of DO2 and VO2 in critically ill patients including those after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Intermittent spectacular technological achievements have accelerated the rate of progress. Therapeutic advances have been particularly impressive during the recent decades. Examination of the relation between DO2 and VO2 provides a useful framework around which the care of the critically ill may be developed. Until now, only a few groups have used this framework to examine children after cardiopulmonary bypass. The key topics that will be covered in this review article are the evolution of the concept from its early development to its present, increasingly sophisticated, role in the management of critically ill patients, with a focus on children after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery."

            "abstract": "The objective of this study is to correlate the severity of hypothermia in sick extramural neonates with fatality and physiological derangements. This is a prospective observational study carried out at the referral neonatal unit of a teaching hospital admitting extramural neonates. The subjects comprised of 100 extramural hypothermic neonates transported to the Referral neonatal unit. Neonates weighing more than 1000 g, with abdominal skin temperature less than 36.5 degrees C at admission were included in the study. Hypothermia was classified as per WHO recommendations. Clinical features including age, weight, gestational age, clinical diagnosis, vitals, place of delivery, details of transportation and capillary filling time were recorded at the time of admission. Oxygen saturation was recorded by a pulse oximeter. Samples for sepsis screen, blood culture and blood glucose were taken at admission. During the study it was observed that fatality was 39.3% in mildly hypothermic babies, 51.6% in moderately hypothermic babies and 80% in severely hypothermic babies. However, the presence of associated illness (birth asphyxia, neonatal sepsis and respiratory distress), physiological derangements (hypoxia, hypoglycemia and shock) and weight less than 2000 g were associated with more than 50% fatality even in mildly hypothermic babies. When moderate hypothermia was associated with hypoxia or shock, the fatality was 83.3% and 90.9% respectively. Similarly, mild hypothermia with hypoglycemia was associated with 71.4% fatality. The conclusion drawn from this study is that the WHO classification of severity of hypothermia correlates with the risk of fatality. However, it considers only body temperature to classify severity of hypothermia. The presence of associated illness (birth asphyxia, neonatal sepsis and respiratory distress), physiological derangements (hypoxia, hypoglycemia and shock) and weight less than 2000 g should be considered adverse factors in hypothermic neonates. Their presence should classify hypothermia in the next higher category of severity in WHO classification."

            "abstract": "In Italy viper bites represent an uncommon event, though envenomation can cause severe complications, more in children than adults, because of dose/body size ratio. We present a case series within a selected population: 10 Italian cases (from Rome surroundings) of viperbites requiring PICU admission, over a 5-year interval. Five children showed a systemic involvement, whereas the remaining patients showed a damage. All were managed and closely monitored in an ICU setting. Relevant clinical findings and therapeutic approach, ICU course and complications have been recorded. Age range was 3-15 years with mean age of 6,9 (SD±4,58) years; 2 patients needed respiratory support beyond oxygen supplementation. Most patients underwent fluid loading, while hemodynamic support was given to4/10. Median PICU stay was 60 hours (IQR=24.0-75.5). No mortality was reported. Indications and precautions for administration of antivenom in the last years have been reviewed: early treatment seems to reduce mortality/morbidity, though representing a threat for children. Current recommendations for the treatment of viper envenomation have been described, based on a literature's review and the application of these knowledges to clinical reality of our PICUs. Therefore, paediatric patients with systemic or rapidly evolving symptoms should be monitored carefully for the development of bite-related complications in an ICU setting mostly in younger children."

Inclusion criteria were age ≤2 years and pre-procedural selection of prophylactic PICU monitoring after MLB between January 2010 and December 2015. Children were excluded for existing tracheostomy, if undergoing concurrent non-otolaryngeal procedures, or if intubated at the time of PICU admission.

Minor complications were noted within 5 h of monitoring and included isolated stridor (24%), desaturation <90% (10%), and nausea/emesis (8%). Minor interventions included supplemental oxygen via regular nasal cannula (39%), single-dose inhaled racemic epinephrine (19%), single-dose systemic corticosteroids (19%), or high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy (4%). Save for two cases of HFNC, interventions were completed or discontinued within 5 h. Median PICU LOS was 1.1 days and median cost was $9650 (IQR: $8235- $14,861) per encounter.

Minor interventions and complications were noted early during post-procedural monitoring. PICU monitoring was substantially more expensive than same-day PACU observation. Young age as the sole criteria for prophylactic PICU monitoring after diagnostic or therapeutic MLB may be unjustified when comparable, cost-conscious care can be achieved in a PACU setting. Prior to pre-procedural selection of PICU monitoring, we recommend a broad contextual risk assessment including a review of comorbidities, operative plan, and intended anesthetic exposure."

            "abstract": "Seven ventilated children with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were studied. While supine and haemodynamically stable, baseline arterial blood-gas analyses and haemodynamic measurements, including cardiac output, were performed. Each child was then turned prone and 30 min later a repeat set of measurements were made. Following this, the children were returned to the supine position and 30 min later a final set of measurements were performed. Ventilation and inotropic support remained unchanged during these positional changes. No significant effect on heart rate, mean systemic arterial blood pressure and cardiac output occurred following these positional changes (p > 0.05; Friedman's ANOVA). Arterial oxygen saturation significantly improved, however, when nursed in the prone position (p < 0.02). Similarly, oxygen delivery significantly increased (p < 0.02). The prone position improves arterial oxygenation and oxygen delivery in children with ARDS. By adopting the prone position, in ventilated children with ARDS, we surmise that realistic gas exchange targets may be reachable with lower levels of inspired oxygen and/or peak airway pressures."

            "abstract": "Reduction in mortality from bronchiolitis in developed health is principally achieved from the availability of critical care. Different health care providers and countries demonstrate considerable variance in admission rates, but globally the use and cost of this resource are increasing. The reasons of this are multifold and include organizational, cultural, and clinical aspects. The organization of care has evolved differently in different health care settings at the threshold of critical need, with local priorities and resources determining the location of care (ward or critical care). Critical care areas adopting high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT) (a ward-based therapy in some institutions) have seen significant increase in their occupancy, without change in rates of mechanical ventilation. Culturally, some countries appear to have a lower threshold for intubation and mechanical ventilation: United States (18%), Finland (4%), and even in countries with high rates of critical care admission (27% in Australia and New Zealand), intubation rates can decline with time (reducing from 27% to 11%). Baseline clinical characteristics of children admitted to critical care are remarkably similar, children are young (c30-60 days) and often born prematurely (21-46%). Clinical thresholds for admission as predefined by critical care units in online guidance focus on presence of apnea (observed in 7-42% of admissions), low pulse oxygen saturation and subjective measures (exhaustion and reduced consciousness). Clinical characteristics of children at the time of admission are commonly reported in relation to the modified Woods Clinical Asthma Score (mean = 3.8 to ≥7) and raised pCO2 (range = 8.0-8.8 kPa), with pCO2 the only significant parameter in a multivariate analysis of factors associated with intubation. KEY POINTS: · More children are being admitted to intensive care over time with increased costs.. · Cultural, organizational, and clinical variance exist between centers and countries.. · Comparing and aligning admissions is difficult as there are no standardized criteria.."

Laboratory and observational studies have raised the possibility that prolonged RBC storage may adversely affect clinical outcomes. Compared with RBCs stored less than 1 week, there are no clinical data demonstrating that RBCs stored longer remain as effective at carrying or releasing oxygen, and observational studies have risen to possibility that prolonged RBC storage might result in harm to vulnerable patients requiring blood transfusions. The \"Age of Blood Evaluation\" (ABLE) study (ISRCTN44878718) is a double-blind, multicenter, parallel randomized controlled clinical trial. It will test the hypothesis that the transfusion of prestorage leukoreduced RBCs stored for 7 days or less (fresh arm) as compared with standard-issue RBCs stored, on average, 15 to 20 days (control arm) will lead to lower 90-day all-cause mortality and reduced morbidity in critically ill adults. We include adults in intensive care units (ICUs) who (1) have had a request for a first RBC unit transfusion during the first 7 days of ICU admission and (2) have an anticipated requirement for ongoing invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation exceeding 48 hours. Enrolled patients are randomized at the time of transfusion to receive either standard-issue RBC units or RBCs stored 7 days or less issued by the local hospital transfusion service. The primary outcome is 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes include ICU and hospital mortality, organ failure, and serious nosocomial infections. With 2510 patients, we will be able to detect a 5% absolute risk reduction (from 25% to 20%). The ABLE study is currently enrolling patients in 23 university-affiliated and community-hospital ICUs across Canada; sites in France and United Kingdom are expected to start recruitment in 2011. Regardless of the results, ABLE study will have significant implications on the duration of RBC storage. A negative trial will reassure clinicians and blood bankers regarding the effectiveness and safety of standard-issue RBCs. A positive trial will have significant implications with respect to inventory management of RBCs given to critically ill adults with a high risk of mortality and will also prompt research to better understand the RBC storage lesion in the hopes of minimizing its clinical consequences through the development of better storage methods."

            "abstract": "Therapeutic plasma exchange in children is increasingly recognized as a life-saving treatment and is challenged by some technical considerations. As extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been used for nearly half a century for refractory reversible respiratory and/or cardiac failure in both pediatric and adult populations, it may serve as an extracorporeal platform for therapeutic plasma exchange. It is most commonly described in patients with sepsis with multiple organ failure or thrombocytopenia associated multi organ failure. Additional pathophysiological processes of inflammatory and immunological storms might benefit from the combination of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and plasma exchange. This is a nonmethodological review of English-language reports of therapeutic plasma exchange performed in patients supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, both pediatric and adult, searching six databases, MEDLINE, Clinical Key, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, CINAHL, Cochrane library, and EMBASE."

            "title": "Outcomes for extremely premature infants.",
            "abstract": "Premature birth is a significant cause of infant and child morbidity and mortality. In the United States, the premature birth rate, which had steadily increased during the 1990s and early 2000s, has decreased annually for 7 years and is now approximately 11.39%. Human viability, defined as gestational age at which the chance of survival is 50%, is currently approximately 23 to 24 weeks in developed countries. Infant girls, on average, have better outcomes than infant boys. A relatively uncomplicated course in the intensive care nursery for an extremely premature infant results in a discharge date close to the prenatal estimated date of confinement. Despite technological advances and efforts of child health experts during the last generation, the extremely premature infant (less than 28 weeks gestation) and extremely low birth weight infant (<1000 g) remain at high risk for death and disability with 30% to 50% mortality and, in survivors, at least 20% to 50% risk of morbidity. The introduction of continuous positive airway pressure, mechanical ventilation, and exogenous surfactant increased survival and spurred the development of neonatal intensive care in the 1970s through the early 1990s. Routine administration of antenatal steroids during premature labor improved neonatal mortality and morbidity in the late 1990s. The recognition that chronic postnatal administration of steroids to infants should be avoided may have improved outcomes in the early 2000s. Evidence from recent trials attempting to define the appropriate target for oxygen saturation in preterm infants suggests arterial oxygen saturation between 91% and 95% (compared with 85%-89%) avoids excess mortality; however, final analyses of data from these trials have not been published, so definitive recommendations are still pending. The development of neonatal neurocritical intensive care units may improve neurocognitive outcomes in this high-risk group. Long-term follow-up to detect and address developmental, learning, behavioral, and social problems is critical for children born at these early gestational ages.The striking similarities in response to extreme prematurity in the lung and brain imply that agents and techniques that benefit one organ are likely to also benefit the other. Finally, because therapy and supportive care continue to change, the outcomes of extremely low birth weight infants are ever evolving. Efforts to minimize injury, preserve growth, and identify interventions focused on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways are now being evaluated. Thus, treating and preventing long-term deficits must be developed in the context of a \"moving target.\""

Early use of 2002 guidelines was associated with improved outcome in the community hospital emergency department (number needed to treat = 3.3) and tertiary pediatric intensive care setting (number needed to treat = 3.6); every hour that went by without guideline adherence was associated with a 1.4-fold increased mortality risk. The updated 2007 guidelines continue to recognize an increased likelihood that children with septic shock, compared with adults, require 1) proportionally larger quantities of fluid, 2) inotrope and vasodilator therapies, 3) hydrocortisone for absolute adrenal insufficiency, and 4) ECMO for refractory shock.

One hundred and ten patients with the median age of 8 months were included in the study: 56 were assigned to the spontaneous breathing trial group and 54 were assigned to the control group. Demographic and clinical data and Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery-1 classification were similar in both groups. Patients undergoing the spontaneous breathing trial had greater extubation success (83% vs 68%, p = 0.02) and shorter PICU length of stay (median 85 vs 367 hr, p < 0.0001) compared with the control group, respectively.

Guidelines for the management of chronic heart failure in adults and children have recently been published by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation the American College of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association. The primary aim of heart failure therapy is to reduce symptoms, preserve long-term ventricular performance, and prolong survival primarily through antagonism of the neurohormonal compensatory mechanisms. Because some medications may be detrimental during an acute decompensation, physicians who manage these patients as inpatients must be knowledgeable about the medications and therapeutic goals of chronic heart failure treatment. Understanding the mechanisms of chronic heart failure may foster improved understanding of the treatment of decompensated heart failure."

The potential of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy to improve survival of infants with CDH remains controversial. Comparison was made in a single institution's pre-ECMO and post-ECMO survival statistics to establish efficacy of extracorporeal support for persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH). This study was accomplished by stratifying patients by an oxygen index (OI). Sixty-eight patients were treated for CDH from 1977 to 1986 without ECMO. Fifty-eight patients underwent repair of CDH within the first 24 hours of life. Data could be retrieved for calculation of the OI in 46 patients. Nineteen patients developed an OI of 40 or greater; one survived (5%). Three of 27 patients with an OI less than 40 died (OIs = 34, 38, and 38). Thirty-one patients were treated from 1987 to 1989 and none were excluded from ECMO based on a minimum PO2. Fifteen had an OI less than 40 (range, 1 to 38), were treated conventionally, and 13 survived (87%). Sixteen patients had an OI greater than 40 and 13 qualified for ECMO. Nine of 13 survived (69%). Comparing pre-ECMO and post-ECMO survival for infants with an OI of 40 or greater (5% v 69%), there is a significant improvement in survival when ECMO is used (P less than .001).

Noninvasive ventilation was considered as a next step in more than 85% of respondents when the patient is failing with high flow nasal cannula. Significant practice variations were observed in clinical practice markers used, flow weaning strategy, and supportive practices. Views comparing high flow nasal cannula to continuous positive airway pressure also noticeably varied across the respondents.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Significant practice variations including views of high flow nasal cannula compared to continuous positive airway pressure was found among pediatric intensive care physicians. To expedite establishment and standardization of high flow nasal cannula practice, research aimed at understanding the heterogeneity found in this study should be undertaken."

In such conditions, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) may improve oxygenation and reduce the need for ECMO therapy. We studied early changes in OI and Aao(2) gradients in response to iNO treatment that may indicate a need to continue iNO treatment or the necessity to start an ECMO therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      In this prospective study, we used 34 outborn neonatal patients that were referred to our pediatric critical care unit in a children's hospital for ECMO therapy with diagnosis of hypoxemic respiratory failure. In all patients, iNO therapy, starting at 80 ppm, was instituted either during transport or on arrival to hospital. Response to iNO was assessed after 1 hour, at which time, iNO concentration was reduced to 40 ppm, provided there was more than 20% improvement in either or both oxygenation indices. Patients who did not respond positively to continuous iNO therapy and met ECMO criteria were given ECMO therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Inhaled nitric oxide therapy alone was successful in 10 (29%) of 34 patients.

No mortality occurred with any treatment. Within 4 hours after iNO therapy, patients who required early ECMO therapy had significantly higher OI and Aao(2) gradients than patients who were treated with iNO therapy alone (P<.01, analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test).

            "abstract": "Despite our growing experience in the medical care of extremely preterm infants and critically ill neonates, there are serious gaps in the understanding and clinical application of the adaptive physiology of the newborn. Neonatal physiology is often misinterpreted and considered similar to that of adult physiology. The human psyche has been seriously influenced, both from an evolutionary and survival point of view, by the cause and effect of hypoxemia which is considered as a warning sign of impending death. Within this context, it is unimaginable for even the highly trained professionals to consider saturation as low as 65% as acceptable. However, all available data suggests that newborns can thrive in a hypoxemic environment as they are conditioned to withstand extreme low saturations in the fetal environment. An approach utilizing the benefits of the hypoxic conditioning would prompt the practice of optimal targeted oxygen saturation range in the clinical management of the newborn. Our current understanding of cyanotic congenital heart disease and the physiology of single ventricle circulation, where oxygen saturation in mid 70s is acceptable, is supported by clinical and animal studies. This article argues the need to challenge our current acceptable target oxygen saturation in the newborn and provides the reasoning behind accepting lower target oxygen levels in the critically ill newborn. Challenging the current practice is expected to open a debate paving the way to understand the risks of high target oxygen levels in the newborn compared with the benefits of permissive hypoxia in avoiding the associated morbidity and mortality of oxygen radical injury."

Platelet maximal oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOSCI+CII), P < 0.02, and maximal respiratory capacity (ETSCI+CII), P < 0.04, were both significantly increased compared to pre-arrest values. This was primarily due to a significant increase in succinate-supported respiration through Complex II (OXPHOSCII, P < 0.02 and ETSCII, P < 0.03). Higher respiration was not due to uncoupling, as the LEAKCI + CII respiration (mitochondrial respiration independent of ATP-production) was unchanged after CA/ROSC. Larger increases in platelet mitochondrial respiratory control ratio (RCR) compared to pre-CA RCR were significantly correlated with lower RCRs in the cortex (P < 0.03) and hippocampus (P < 0.04) compared to sham respiration.

This is a retrospective chart review study, conducted at our tertiary level PICU and is related to critically ill pediatric patients who required platelet transfusion. Methods We retrieved the target patient population data from our blood bank database. The patients were subdivided into four subgroups: hematologic (hematologic malignancies, bone marrow suppression, hemolytic anemia, and sickle cell disease), surgical (post-surgical, trauma and acute bleeding), the unstable fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2 > 0.6 and/or inotropic support), and the stable patients. Critically ill children between one month and 21 years of age were enrolled. We excluded patients who underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Results A total of 197 transfusion episodes in 64 patients were analyzed. The distribution of transfusions episodes included hematologic 82% (n=161), surgical 7% (n=13), unstable 8% (n=16), stable 3% (n=7). The mean standard deviation (SD) of pre-transfusion platelet count (x1000) in all the patients and children in hematologic, surgical, unstable and stable groups were 29 (22), 29 (19), 47 (46), 28 (19), and 24 (14), respectively.

This study examines 2 different perfusion strategies and their impact on various outcome measures including acute kidney injury (AKI), urine output on CPB, ICU length of stay, time to extubation, and mortality. Predicated upon surgeon preference, the study institution employs 2 different perfusion strategies (PS) during congenital cardiac surgery requiring CPB. One method utilizes a targeted 2.4 L/min/m2 CI and nadir hematocrit of 28% (PS1), the other a 3.0 L/min/m2 CI with a nadir hematocrit of 25% (PS2). This study retrospectively examines CPB cases during which the 2 perfusion strategies were applied to determine potential differences in packed red blood cell administration, urine output during CPB, AKI post-CPB as defined by the KDIGO criteria, and operative survival as defined by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Significant differences were found in urine output while on CPB (P < 0.01) and all combined stages of postoperative AKI (P = 0.01) with the PS2 group faring better in both measures. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups for packed red blood cell administration, mortality, time to extubation, or ICU length of stay. Avoiding a nadir hematocrit less than 25% has been well established but maintaining anything greater than that may not be necessary to achieve adequate oxygen delivery on CPB. Our results indicate that higher CI and oxygen delivery on CPB are associated with a lower rate of AKI and this may be achieved with increased flow rather than increasing the hematocrit thus avoiding unnecessary transfusion."

Patients managed with ECMO following cardiac surgery were analyzed separately from patients not in the postoperative period. Factors associated with an increased probability of mortality in the postoperative patients were age <1 month, male gender, longer duration of mechanical ventilation before ECMO, and development of renal or hepatic dysfunction while on ECMO. Single ventricle physiology and failure to separate from cardiopulmonary bypass were not associated with an increased risk of mortality. Cardiac physiology and indication for ECMO were not associated with mortality rate. Although longer duration of ECMO was not associated with increased mortality risk, patients with longer duration of ECMO were less likely to survive without heart transplantation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In a series of 137 patients managed with ECMO in a pediatric cardiac intensive care unit, survival to hospital discharge was 39%.

BPD is a disease which is defined oddly by its treatment rather than its pathophysiology, leading to frequently changing nomenclature which has widespread implications on our ability to both understand and follow the progression of BPD. As various treatment modalities for BPD were developed and a larger number of extremely preterm infants survived, the \"old\" BPD based on lung injury from oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation transitioned into a \"new\" BPD focused more on the interruption of normal development. However, the interruption of normal development does not solely apply to lung development. The effects of prematurity on vascular development cannot be overstated and pulmonary vascular disease has become the new frontier of BPD. As we begin to better understand the complex, multifactorial pathophysiology of BPD, it is necessary to again focus on appropriate, pathology-driven nomenclature that can effectively describe the multiple clinical phenotypes of BPD."

Using near infrared spectroscopy, rcSO2 values were recorded immediately after birth. All preterm infants were initially given 0.3 FiO2 and were divided into 2 groups according to subsequent FiO2 requirements of either ≤0.3 or >0.3 FiO2. Using a mixed-effects model, we compared the difference between the groups over time. Also, the area measures below 55% (hypoxia) and above 85% (hyperoxia) were compared between the groups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The mean (SD) gestation was 29.4 (1.6) weeks and the mean (SD) weight was 1.3 (0.4) kg. Less than one-half of the infants (20/45; 43%) required ≤0.3 FiO2. In the delivery suite, the median (IQR) rcSO2 in the low and high FiO2 groups were 81% (66%-86%) and 72% (62%-86%), respectively. Patients in the high FiO2 group had a larger rcSO2 area below 55% (P = .01). There was a significant difference in rcSO2 between the groups (P < .05), with the low group having higher rcSO2 values initially, but this difference changed over time. In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), rcSO2 values were lower by 7.1% (CI 12.13 to 2.06%) P = .008 in the high FiO2 group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Infants given >0.3 FiO2 had more cerebral hypoxia than infants requiring ≤0.3 FiO2 but no difference in the degree of cerebral hyperoxia, both in the delivery suite and the NICU. This suggests that a more rapid increase in oxygen titration maybe be required initially for preterm infants."

            "abstract": "Prolonged usage of disposable extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuitry increases the risk of mechanical complications due to breakdown or malposition of the circuit elements. Often, such complications are life threatening for the critically ill patient. Such problems need to be rapidly identified and corrected. Algorithms can be especially helpful in such acute, life-threatening situations. We have outlined an algorithm that uses the relationship between three hemodynamic variables that can be used to rapidly identify mechanical dysfunctions associated with use of the ECMO circuit. These hemodynamic variables are premembrane pressure, pump flow, and patient mean systemic arterial pressure (the PPP triad). These variables are interrelated as a change in one variable results in a change in another. Mechanical malfunction can eliminate this relationship. Changes in one variable only suggest mechanical impairment or failure of the ECMO system. When such a change is detected, a checklist can be rapidly reviewed that directs an immediate logical assessment of potential mechanical causes of hemodynamic compromise."

            "abstract": "Supplemental oxygen use in the preterm infant is required for survival. Evidence supports a narrow therapeutic window between the helpful and harmful effects of supplemental oxygen in this vulnerable population. The clinical question was-what are the recommended oxygen saturation targets for the preterm infant and the preterm infant corrected to term? Multiple databases were searched for published research in English from 2008 to 2014 using key search terms. A total of 18 articles met inclusion criteria. Early neonatal research linked high levels of supplemental oxygen with retinopathy of prematurity and blindness. Years later, correlations between high arterial oxygen levels and oxidative stress leading to pulmonary and/or neurologic insults were established. Three large multicentered, international studies have recently been published (BOOST II, COT, and SUPPORT), which support oxygen saturation target ranges of 87% to 94% until vascular maturation of the retina is achieved. Two of the 3 studies reported a significant correlation between low saturation limits (85%-89%) and death in the extremely preterm population. Identified best care strategies to prevent states of hypoxia and/or hyperoxia include establishing clear target saturation limits according to recommendations, which are supported by the multidisciplinary team, adequate nurse to patient ratio, improve knowledge deficits, improve bedside compliance, and finally visual cues to remind caregivers of target saturation ranges."

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a well-known complication of diabetes mellitus and can be associated with devastating cerebral edema resulting in severe long-term neurologic disability. Despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, relatively few treatments are recommended for these patients. The authors present two patients in which they used both intracranial pressure and brain tissue oxygenation monitoring to manage diabetic ketoacidosis-associated cerebral edema with favorable neurologic outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care teaching hospital.\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      Two children presented to the emergency room with vague complaints and were found to have diabetic ketoacidosis.

Brain tissue oxygenation was also noted to be significantly less than the target value on several occasions even when intracranial pressure was controlled and an age-appropriate cerebral perfusion pressure goal was met. Augmentation of cerebral perfusion pressure above age-appropriate goal with fluid boluses and inotropic agents increased brain tissue oxygenation in these instances.

The present study was aimed to examine the relationship between beta cell dysfunction and severity of disease among critically ill children.This prospective study included 1146 critically ill children, who were admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of Hunan Children's Hospital from November 2011 to August 2013. Information on characteristics, laboratory tests, and prognostic outcomes was collected. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-β, evaluating beta cell function, was used to divide all participants into 4 groups: HOMA-β = 100% (group I, n = 339), 80% ≤ HOMA-β < 100% (group II, n = 71), 40% ≤ HOMA-β < 80% (group III, n = 293), and HOMA-β < 40% (group IV, n = 443). Severity of disease was assessed using the worst Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) III score, incidence of organ damage, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), mechanical ventilation (MV) and mortality. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk of developing poor outcomes among patients in different HOMA-β groups, with group I as the reference group.Among 1146 children, incidence of HOMA-β < 100% was 70.41%. C-peptide and insulin declined with the decrement of HOMA-β (P < 0.01). C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels, rather than white blood cell, were significantly different among 4 groups (P < 0.01). In addition, the worst SOFA score and the worst PRISMIII score increased with declined HOMA-β. For example, the worst SOFA score in group I, II, III, and IV was 1.55 ± 1.85, 1.71 ± 1.93, 1.92 ± 1.63, and 2.18 ± 1.77, respectively. Furthermore, patients with declined HOMA-β had higher risk of developing septic shock, MODS, MV, and mortality, even after adjusting age, gender, myocardial injury, and lung injury. For instance, compared with group I, the multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for developing septic shock was 2.17 (0.59, 8.02), 2.94 (2.18, 6.46), and 2.76 (1.18, 6.46) among patients in group II, III, and IV, respectively.Beta cell dysfunction reflected the severity of disease among critically ill children.

            "abstract": "Children born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome are at high risk for serious morbidity, growth failure, and mortality during the interstage period, which is the time from discharge home after first-stage hypoplastic left heart syndrome palliation until the second-stage surgical intervention. The single-ventricle circulatory physiology is complex, fragile, and potentially unstable. Multicenter initiatives have been successfully implemented to improve outcomes and optimize growth and survival during the interstage period. A crucial focus of care is the comprehensive family training in the use of home surveillance monitoring of oxygen saturation, enteral intake, weight, and the early recognition of \"red flag\" symptoms indicating potential cardiopulmonary or nutritional decompensation. Beginning with admission to the intensive care unit of the newborn with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, nurses provide critical care and education to prepare the family for interstage home care. This article presents detailed nursing guidelines for educating families on the home care of their medically fragile infant with single-ventricle circulation."

We performed a retrospective study on the outcome of children with PL between 1990 and 2008 referred to our tertiary center. Seven patients with histologically proven PL were identified over the 18-year period. Six patients presented in the neonatal period and one patient at 7 months of age, all of them requiring intensive care treatment. Three neonatal patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Six of the seven patients did not survive including all those who received ECMO. Two of the six non-survivors died of other causes than their underlying disease. The only survivor had an antenatal diagnosis of hydrops and required in utero chest drain insertion. Postnatally he was managed with maximal medical treatment for bilateral pleural effusions and persistent pulmonary hypertension. A 7-month follow-up showed this infant to be doing well. In conclusion overall the prognosis of congenital PL remains poor. The one survivor demonstrates that this condition is survivable with aggressive intervention and as current evidence suggests gradual improvement of symptoms may occur over time, and that maximal medical treatment remains warranted."

Myocarditis patients required considerable support including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; 49.1%), milrinone (45%), epinephrine (35%), mechanical ventilation (25%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (7%), and cardiac transplantation (5%). Even in patients with extreme illness scores, IVIG use did not impact survival (P = 0.67). Overall survival of myocarditis patients was 92%. Myocarditis patients who died presented with a higher severity of illness and required frequent use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other ICU therapies. In conclusion, pediatric patients with myocarditis have considerable variability in their presentations and outcomes, use more resources, and die more often than children with other diagnoses. Attempts at using characteristics that uniformly predict illness severity or survival were not successful. Despite increased use in the sickest patients, IVIG conferred no survival advantage."

Additionally, we analyzed this relationship for children with and without mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH; 32-34 °C).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This observational cohort study included all children (aged >28 days) with CA and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) between 2002 and 2011. The first research question was the association between PaO2 and IH mortality after ROSC. This was analyzed for three hyperoxia cutoff values, and for three time intervals using the cumulative PaO2 determined with the area under the curve (AUC). For the second research question, these analyses were repeated for children with and without MTH.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 200 patients included (median age 2.6 years), 84 (42%) survived to hospital discharge. Fifty-eight children (29%) were treated with MTH. With the cutoff analysis and the AUC analysis we found no relationship between PaO2 and IH mortality. However, analysis of the MTH-group showed a lower IH mortality in children with high cumulative PaO2 levels on two of the three time intervals. Multivariable analysis showed significantly higher odds of survival (0.643 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.424-0.976), 0.554 (95% CI 0.335-0.916)).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Cumulative PaO2 analysis showed that the IH mortality is significantly lower in MTH-treated children with high PaO2 levels.

            "abstract": "We reviewed retrospectively the incidence of complications encountered with two different umbilical artery catheters (UACs): a silicone-rubber end-hole catheter and an electrode-tipped, side-hole catheter for continuous, invasive monitoring of arterial oxygen tension (PaO2). During calendar year 1989, there were 457 admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit: 168 patients had placement of a UAC. Two of these were admitted only briefly for cardiac catheterization and were eliminated from analysis. One patient had both types of catheters placed sequentially. Thus the data on 166 patients with 51 PaO2 monitors and 116 silicone-rubber UACs were evaluated. The patients who had a PaO2 monitor UAC had a lower mean birth weight than those in the other group (1621 +/- 1043 gm vs 1972 +/- 1048 gm; p = 0.0473). The catheter life span was not different between the groups, with a range of 1 to 16 days for PaO2 monitors and 1 to 27 days for silicone-rubber UACs. Inability to withdraw blood, poor blood pressure tracing, or both conditions resulted in catheter removal for 5 of 51 PaO2 monitor UACs and 4 of 116 end-hole UACs. The incidence of these problems did not differ significantly between the two groups. There were no cases of thromboembolic complications in the patients who had a PaO2 monitor UAC, whereas two of the silicone-rubber UACs were removed because of perfusion problems in the lower limbs, which resolved with decannulation. We conclude that the use of the PaO2 monitor UAC allows for continuous, invasive monitoring of PaO2 without any significant increase in risk compared with that for the silicone-rubber end-hole UAC."

Our case is a 5-month old infant with acute respiratory failure associated with gas trapping, hypercarbia, respiratory acidosis, and air leak. Despite maximal conventional ventilation, bronchodilator therapy, corticosteroids, and sedation, the infant continued to demonstrate worsening gas exchange necessitating an escalation of support to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. After the development of an air leak and continued difficulties with carbon dioxide clearance, the patient was transitioned to high-frequency jet ventilation. Persistent hypercarbia resulted in the addition of heliox to facilitate ventilation. Improvements in gas exchange occurred rapidly. The combination of heliox and high frequency jet ventilation resulted in improved carbon dioxide clearance, respiratory stabilization, and the ability to wean ventilator settings."

This review summarises the current understanding of the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and management of COVID-19 in children and adolescents. The prevalence of COVID-19 is significantly lower in children than adults, but paediatric disease is likely underdiagnosed as a result of the high numbers of asymptomatic or mild cases. Children are vulnerable to family cluster outbreaks, but are unlikely to be index cases within a household. Vertical transmission or breast milk transmission are yet to be proven. Between 10 and 90% of paediatric COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic. Symptomatic cases typically present with mild symptoms, including cough, fever and sore throat. Intensive care admission and mortality are rare. Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 is a rare, but severe, newly emerging phenotype. At present, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 in adults or children; management is usually supportive. For severe or critical disease, including paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19, the decision to start antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy should be on a case-by-case basis; in the UK, this should be done within a clinical trial. Further research is needed into both the disease course and treatment of paediatric COVID-19."

            "abstract": "Impaired neurodevelopment in preterm infants is caused by prematurity itself; however, hypoxia/ischemia, inflammation, and hyperoxia contribute to the extent of impairment. Because preterm birth is accompanied by a dramatic decrease in 17β-estradiol (E2) and progesterone, preliminary clinical studies have been carried out to substitute these steroids in preterm infants; however, they failed to confirm significantly improved neurologic outcomes. We therefore hypothesized that the persistently high postnatal production of fetal zone steroids [mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)] until term could interfere with E2-mediated protection. We investigated whether E2 could reduce hyperoxia-mediated apoptosis in three immature glial cell types and detected the involved receptors. Thereafter, we investigated protection by the fetal zone steroids DHEA, 16α-hydroxy-DHEA, and androstenediol. For DHEA, the involved receptors were evaluated. We examined aromatases, which convert fetal zone steroids into more estrogenic compounds. Finally, cotreatment was compared against single hormone treatment to investigate synergism. In all cell types, E2 and fetal zone steroids resulted in significant dose-dependent protection, whereas the mediating receptors differed. The neuroprotection by fetal zone steroids highly depended on the cell type-specific expression of aromatases, the receptor repertoire, and the potency of the fetal zone steroids toward these receptors. No synergism in fetal zone steroid and E2 cotreatment was detected in two of three cell types. Therefore, E2 supplementation may not be beneficial with respect to neuroprotection because fetal zone steroids circulate in persistently high concentrations until term in preterm infants. Hence, a refined experimental model for preterm infants is required to investigate potential treatments."

With the pediatric-sized Berlin Heart we used miniaturized extracorporeal pneumatically driven blood pumps, the lowest stroke volume being 10 ml.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In 18 children, age 3-345 (median 147) days, artificial replacement of heart function was applied for long-term support (1-64, median 10 days) as a life-saving measure in our hospital. Nine had LVAD and nine BVAD support. All were in cardiogenic shock with multiorgan failure; three had fulminant myocarditis, four cardiomyopathy, and one chronic stage of congenital heart disease. Five children were weaned from the system, three reached heart transplantation, and 10 died on the VAD. There were no differences between groups A and B regarding age, body weight or diagnosis, but the duration of mechanical support differed: Group A, median 2, range 1-16 days; group B, median 12, range 1-100 days. Since 1999 (group B), the survival rate of our small infants has increased to 70% whereas none of the infants in group A survived to be discharged.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The outcome of VAD support in small infants is no longer inferior to that of adult support, now optimized cannulas, modified anticoagulation and optimized surgical and intensive care management have been established."

We calculated the relative change in RBC distribution width from admission RBC distribution width to the highest RBC distribution width during the first 7 days of hospitalization. Our primary outcome was ICU mortality or use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a composite. Secondary outcomes were ICU- and ventilator-free days.\n    \n\n\n          Measurements and main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 3,913 eligible subjects with an estimated mortality (by Pediatric Index of Mortality 2) of 2.94% ± 9.25% and an actual ICU mortality of 2.91%. For the study cohort, admission RBC distribution width was 14.12% ± 1.89% and relative change in RBC distribution width was 2.63% ± 6.23%. On univariate analysis, both admission RBC distribution width and relative change in RBC distribution width correlated with mortality or the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (odds ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.12-1.27] and odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.04-1.08], respectively; p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding variables, including severity of illness, both admission RBC distribution width (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24) and relative change in RBC distribution width (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07) remained independently associated with ICU mortality or the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Admission RBC distribution width and relative change in RBC distribution width both weakly correlated with fewer ICU- (r = 0.038) and ventilator-free days (r = 0.05) (p < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Independent of illness severity in critically ill children, admission RBC distribution width is associated with ICU mortality and morbidity. These data suggest that RBC distribution width may be a biomarker for RBC injury that is of sufficient magnitude to influence critical illness outcome, possibly via oxygen delivery impairment."

Acute viral bronchiolitis is associated with airway obstruction and turbulent gas flow. Heliox, a mixture of oxygen and the inert gas helium, may improve gas flow through high-resistance airways and decrease the work of breathing. In this review, we selected trials that objectively assessed the effect of the addition of heliox to standard medical care for acute bronchiolitis.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess heliox inhalation therapy in addition to standard medical care for acute bronchiolitis in infants with respiratory distress, as measured by clinical endpoints (in particular the rate of endotracheal intubation, the rate of emergency department discharge, the length of treatment for respiratory distress) and pulmonary function testing (mainly clinical respiratory scores).\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to March week 3, 2015), EMBASE (1974 to March 2015), LILACS (1982 to March 2015) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website (May 2009).\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of heliox in infants with acute bronchiolitis.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included seven trials involving 447 infants younger than two years with respiratory distress secondary to viral bronchiolitis. All children were recruited from a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU; 378 infants), except in one trial (emergency department; 69 infants). All children were younger than two (under nine months in two trials and under three months in one trial). Positive tests for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were required for inclusion in five trials. The two other trials were carried out in the bronchiolitis seasons. Seven different protocols were used for inhalation therapy with heliox.When heliox was used in the PICU, we observed no significant reduction in the rate of intubation: risk ratio (RR) 2.73 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 7.75, four trials, 408 infants, low quality evidence). When heliox inhalation was used in the emergency department, we observed no increase in the rate of discharge: RR 0.51 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.55, one trial, 69 infants, moderate quality evidence).There was no decrease in the length of treatment for respiratory distress: mean difference (MD) -0.19 days (95% CI -0.56 to 0.19, two trials, 320 infants, moderate quality evidence). However, in the subgroup of infants who were started on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) right from the start, because of severe respiratory distress, heliox therapy reduced the length of treatment: MD -0.76 days (95% CI -1.45 to -0.08, one trial, 21 infants, low quality evidence). No adverse events related to heliox inhalation were reported.We found that infants treated with heliox inhalation had a significantly lower mean clinical respiratory score in the first hour after starting treatment when compared to those treated with air or oxygen inhalation: MD -1.04 (95% CI -1.60 to -0.48, four trials, 138 infants, moderate quality evidence). This outcome had statistical heterogeneity, which remained even after removing the study using a standard high-concentration reservoir mask. Several factors may explain this heterogeneity, including first the limited number of patients in each trial, and the wide differences in the baseline severity of disease between studies, with the modified Wood Clinical Asthma Score (m-WCAS) in infants treated with heliox ranging from less than two to more than seven.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Current evidence suggests that the addition of heliox therapy may significantly reduce a clinical score evaluating respiratory distress in the first hour after starting treatment in infants with acute RSV bronchiolitis. We noticed this beneficial effect regardless of which heliox inhalation protocol was used. Nevertheless, there was no reduction in the rate of intubation, in the rate of emergency department discharge, or in the length of treatment for respiratory distress. Heliox could reduce the length of treatment in infants requiring CPAP for severe respiratory distress. Further studies with homogeneous logistics in their heliox application are needed. Inclusion criteria must include a clinical severity score that reflects severe respiratory distress to avoid inclusion of children with mild bronchiolitis who may not benefit from heliox inhalation. Such studies would provide the necessary information as to the appropriate place for heliox in the therapeutic schedule for severe bronchiolitis."

This aim of music therapy amounts to an attempt to help the premature infant regaining its physical and neurological balance, so important to its psychological and physical development, mainly by masking the sometimes excessive noise present in the intensive care unit and/or in the incubator. Studies have demonstrated the positive impact of music therapy on oxygen saturation, heartbeat, and on the general level of relaxation experienced by premature infants. In this project, the palliative technique used was that of live singing, directly to the infant, accompanied by a pentatonic harp. The aim was to improve the state of health, both physical and psychological, of a group of premature infants, whose gestation period varied between 23 and 36 weeks. The technique used was to apply what amounts to a protective cocoon of sounds to a premature infant in the neonatal unit, which measurably reduced the level of stress as indicated by the babies' increasingly relaxed demeanour and induced a measurable increase on the level of oxygen saturation and a reduction of heart rate."

            "abstract": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides temporary life-saving support for pediatric patients with severe cardiac failure, but causes metabolic disturbances and altered nutritional requirements. However, few studies have addressed the optimal energy supply to meet the demand of these children, largely due to technical difficulties with their invasive nature. We have adapted respiratory mass spectrometry to continuously measure O2 consumption and CO2 production in the gas exchange across the ECMO oxygenator, as well as that across the ventilator. This study aimed to assess energy expenditure (EE) and respiratory quotient (RQ) in children on ECMO. Five children (aged 0.3 to 36 months, median 20) were studied between Day 1 and Day 6 on ECMO. EE and RQ were measured in sequential fashion at the child's native lungs and ECMO oxygenator using respiratory mass spectrometry. Measurements were collected at 4-h intervals, with the means in 24 h representing the values of each day. Each child's caloric and protein intakes were recorded for each day. Between ECMO Days 1 and 6, there was a small but significant increase in EE from 40 to 46 kcal/kg/day (P = 0.03). In comparison, the caloric intake significantly increased by twice as much as EE from 30 to 61 kcal/kg/day (P = 0.017). As a result, RQ significantly increased from 0.6 to 1.0 (P < 0.0001). Protein intake significantly increased during ECMO Days 1 to 6 from 0.5 to 1.5 g/kg/day (P = 0.04). Respiratory mass spectrometry is feasible to provide a unique and safe technique to measure EE and RQ in patients on ECMO. Without this knowledge, inadequate feeding may occur. Further studies are warranted in a larger patient population to provide better information to guide clinical practice in this special group of critically ill children."

Because of low first attempt success rates, neonates are often subjected to multiple intubation attempts before the endotracheal tube is successfully placed. These factors conspire to make intubation one of the most dangerous procedures in neonatal medicine. In this commentary we review key elements in the journey to improve neonatal intubation safety. We begin with a review of intubation success rates and complications. Then, we discuss the importance of intubation training. Next, we examine quality improvement efforts and patient safety research to improve neonatal intubation safety. Finally, we evaluate new tools which may improve success rates, and decrease complications during neonatal intubation."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Trauma care in Spain is not provided in specific centres, which means that health professionals have limited contact to trauma patients. After the setting up of a training program in paediatric trauma, the aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of the initial care provided to these patients before they were admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a third level hospital (trauma centre), as an indirect measurement of the increase in the number of health professionals trained in trauma.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      Two cohorts of PICU admissions were reviewed, the first one during the four years immediately before the training courses started (Group 1, period 2001-2004), and the second one during the 4 years (Group 2, period 2012-2015) after nearly 500 professionals were trained. A record was made of the injury mechanism, attending professional, Glasgow coma score (GCS), and paediatric trauma score (PTS). Initial care quality was assessed using five indicators: use of cervical collar, vascular access, orotracheal intubation if GCS ≤ 8, gastric decompression if PTS≤8, and number of actions carried out from the initial four recommended (neck control, provide oxygen, get vascular access, provide IV fluids). Compliance was compared between the 2 periods. A P<.05 was considered statistically significant.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 218 patient records were analysed, 105 in Group 1, and 113 in Group 2. The groups showed differences both in injury mechanism and in initial care team. A shift in injury mechanism pattern was observed, with a decrease in car accidents (28% vs 6%; P<.0001). Patients attended to in low complexity hospitals increased from 29.4% to 51.9% (P=.008), and their severity decreased when assessed using the GCS ≤ 8 (29.8% vs 13.5%; P=.004), or PTS≤8 (48.5% vs 29.7%; P=.005). As regards quality indicators, only the use of neck collar improved its compliance (17.3% to 32.7%; P=.01). Patients who received no action in the initial care remained unchanged (19% vs 11%%; P=.15).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although there are limited improvements, the setting up of a training program has not translated into better initial care for trauma patients in our area of influence. Trauma training should be complemented with other support measures in order to achieve a systematic application of the trauma care principles."

Many factors have converged at this point in time to allow us to offer this support. The availability in the U.S.A. of an advanced oxygenator (Quadrox(D)) (Maquet Inc., Bridgewater, NJ), long-term centrifugal pumps and circuit coatings offers us the means to provide ECLS. The other equally important factor is the intensivist trained in extracorporeal therapies. Once the intensive care unit registered nurse (ICU RN) is trained to safely and effectively manage both the patient and ECLS circuit, this support may be offered. The perfusionist is in an unique position to educate and mentor the ICU RN in ECLS. There is, perhaps, no one in a better position to explain this equipment and its uses in an interdisciplinary-oriented pediatric and adult ECLS program than a perfusionist."

            "abstract": "In neonates, hyperoxia or positive pressure ventilation causes continued lung injury characterized by simplified vascularization and alveolarization, which are the hallmarks of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Although endothelial cells (ECs) have metabolic flexibility to maintain cell function under stress, it is unknown whether hyperoxia causes metabolic dysregulation in ECs, leading to lung injury. We hypothesized that hyperoxia alters EC metabolism, which causes EC dysfunction and lung injury. To test this hypothesis, we exposed lung ECs to hyperoxia (95% O2/5% CO2) followed by air recovery (O2/rec). We found that O2/rec reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation without affecting mitochondrial DNA copy number or mitochondrial mass and that it specifically decreased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in ECs. This was associated with increased ceramide synthesis and apoptosis. Genetic deletion of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), a rate-limiting enzyme for carnitine shuttle, further augmented O2/rec-induced apoptosis. O2/rec-induced ceramide synthesis and apoptosis were attenuated when the FAO was enhanced by l-carnitine. Newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) between Postnatal Days 1 and 4 and were administered l-carnitine (150 and 300 mg/kg, i.p.) or etomoxir, a specific Cpt1 inhibitor (30 mg/kg, i.p.), daily between Postnatal Days 10 and 14. Etomoxir aggravated O2/rec-induced apoptosis and simplified alveolarization and vascularization in mouse lungs. Similarly, arrested alveolarization and reduced vessel numbers were further augmented in EC-specific Cpt1a-knockout mice compared with wild-type littermates in response to O2/rec. Treatment with l-carnitine (300 mg/kg) attenuated O2/rec-induced lung injury, including simplified alveolarization and decreased vessel numbers. Altogether, enhancing FAO protects against hyperoxia-induced EC apoptosis and lung injury in neonates."

            "abstract": "The subject of this paper is to report our experience in the determination of brain death in infants and children. We have retrospectively examined the incidence of brain death occurred in 504 consecutive children admitted to multidisciplinary pediatric ICU at \"Bambino Gesù\" Hospital of Rome during the years 1994 to 1997. According to current Italian Law, brain death was declared in 8 children (1.6%), whose primary diagnoses were: Meningitis (3 cases); nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (2 cases); medulloblastoma (1 case); brain metastasis of neuroblastoma (1 case); SIDS (1 case). All brain death diagnoses were made using clinical criteria and confirmatory tests. A difficult problem was met in achieving the required Pa-CO2 values higher than 60 mmHg without unduly lowering O2 saturation. In order to obtain easily this objective we have recently switched the ventilator to intermittent mandatory volume ventilation at a rate of five stroke per minute using a FiO2 of 1 before starting the apnea test. In infants younger than one year the required cerebral circulatory arrest was documented in the pericallosal artery by doppler ultrasonography performed through the fonticuli cranii. The absence of cerebral blood flow was recorded for one to five days after clinical and electroencephalographic diagnosis of brain death, causing an unnecessary prolonged rianimative support. This also confirms that in young infants brain death may occur without a marked increase of intracranial pressure. Last, but not least, we believe that particular attention must be paid to psycho-emotional conditions of parents as well as of intensivists and nurses especially when brain death must be assessed in children."

Moreover, the relationship of free 25(OH)D and the regulation of endogenous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) remains unknown. The aims of this study were to determine in critically ill adults with respiratory failure the effect of previous high-dose regimens of vitamin D3 on free 25(OH)D concentrations, the relationship of free 25(OH)D with circulating cathelicidin (LL-37) and human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2), and the associations between plasma levels of free 25(OH)D and these AMPs to alveolar macrophage phagocytosis function.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In a double blind, randomized controlled trial, critically ill ventilator-dependent adults (N = 30) received enteral vitamin D3 (250,000 or 500,000 IU total over 5 d) or placebo.

The increase in free 25(OH)D was greater with the 500 000 IU vitamin D3 dose than with the lower dose. The percent change in mRNA expression of hCAP18 was positively associated with percent change in free 25(OH)D at days 7 and 14 (ρ = 0.48; P = 0.04 and ρ = 0.59; P = 0.03, respectively). Additionally, plasma LL-37 levels correlated with the percentage of alveolar macrophages exhibiting phagocytosis (ρ = 0.51; P = 0.04).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The present study found a dose-related increase in plasma free-25(OH)D levels, which was associated with increasing circulating mRNA expression of hCAP18 over time. There were no correlations between changes in total and free 25(OH)D against plasma LL-37 and hBD-2 concentrations.

Activation of inflammatory and innate immune responses and hemostatic alterations contribute to complications. Hyperoxia may play a role in exacerbating these responses. Nine ex vivo ECMO circuits were tested using fresh healthy human whole blood, with two oxygen levels: 21% inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2 ; mild hyperoxia; n = 5) and 100% FiO2 (severe hyperoxia; n = 4). Serial blood samples were taken for analysis of platelet aggregometry, leukocyte activation, inflammatory, and oxidative stress markers. ECMO resulted in reduced adenosine diphosphate- (P < .05) and thrombin receptor activating peptide-induced (P < .05) platelet aggregation, as well as increasing levels of the neutrophil activation marker, neutrophil elastase (P = .013). Additionally, levels of the inflammatory chemokine interleukin-8 were elevated (P < .05) and the activity of superoxide dismutase, a marker of oxidative stress, was increased (P = .002). Hyperoxia did not augment these responses, with no significant differences detected between mild and severe hyperoxia. Our ex vivo model of ECMO revealed that the circuit itself triggers a pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress response, however, exposure to supra-physiologic oxygen does not amplify that response. Extended-duration studies and inclusion of an endothelial component could be beneficial in characterizing longer term changes."

Despite the initial severity of AAA, mechanical ventilation often restores gas exchange promptly, resulting in shorter durations of ventilation. We believe that AAA can occur in children and can lead to respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, children with rapid-onset respiratory failure that requires intubation in the emergency department (ED) are more likely to have AAA and a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation than those intubated in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An 11-year retrospective chart review (1991-2002) was conducted of all children who were aged 2 through 18 years and had the primary diagnosis of status asthmaticus and required mechanical ventilation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      During the study period, 33 (11.4%) of 290 PICU admissions for status asthmaticus required mechanical ventilation.

Mean duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly shorter in the children who presented with rapid respiratory failure versus those with progressive respiratory failure (29 +/- 43 hours vs 88 +/- 72 hours). Children with rapid respiratory failure had greater improvements in ventilation and oxygenation than those with progressive respiratory failure as measured by pre- and postintubation changes in arterial carbon dioxide pressure, arterial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, and alveolar-arterial gradient. According to site of intubation, 23 children required intubation in the ED, whereas 10 were intubated later in the PICU. Mean duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly shorter in the ED group versus the PICU group (42 +/- 63 hours vs 118 +/- 46 hours).

For the transcutaneous measurement a sensor temperature of 44 degrees C was chosen, blood gas analysis was performed on 2 different automatic blood gas analysers. Comparisons of 82 pairs of oxygen and 60 pairs of carbon dioxide partial pressures were made. Our data show a tight linear correlation between cutaneous and arterial partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide, defined by regression equations and correlation coefficients: PtcO2 = 1.22 + 0.8 X PaO2 (r = 0.93) and PtcCO2 = 5.52 + 1.26 X PaCO2 (r = 0.88). We conclude that transcutaneous measurements of oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures are reliable noninvasive techniques for monitoring arterial gas tensions in haemodynamically stable paediatric patients."

In an open prospective design, NIRS measurements have been done during 20 suctioning episodes in 13 preterm neonates. Heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, and carbon dioxide tension were monitored continuously. Behavioural state (BS) observations were made and documented as well. The statistical analysis showed that in patients who were active, with crying periods during suctioning (behavioural states 4-5), changes of oxygenated (p < 0.005) and deoxygenated haemoglobin (p < 0.05), as well as of arterial oxygen saturation (p < 0.05) and heart rate (p < 0.05) were significantly greater than in patients who were quiet with predominant behavioural state 1, 2 and 3. These results underline the influence of behavioural states on the physiological answers to endotracheal suctioning.

While overnight observation in the hospital setting is utilized frequently in children after a AT, ICU setting is commonly used for patients with sleep apnea. This objective of this study is to examine factors associated with the preoperative decision to admit patients to PICU following AT as well as co-morbidities that may justify necessity for higher level of care.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This is a retrospective chart review from the years of 2009-2016. All patients who underwent AT for known sleep-related breathing issues at Nationwide Children's Hospital were eligible for inclusion. A complication was defined as an adverse event such as pulmonary edema, re-intubation, or a bleeding event. Respiratory support was defined as utilizing supplementary oxygen for more than one day, positive pressure ventilation, or intubation. Proportions and medians were used to describe the overall rate of complications/complexities in care, and bivariate statistics were used to evaluate the relationship between patient characteristics and outcomes. Similar methods were used to evaluate factors associated with preoperative referral to the PICU.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were 180 patients admitted to hospital in non-ICU setting and 158 patients with a planned PICU stay. The patients with planned PICU stays had higher rates of technological dependence (13% vs. 3%; p = 0.0006), perioperative sleep studies (80% vs. 29%; p < 0.0001), and more severe classifications of OSA (p < 0.0001). Patients with planned ICU placement also had higher rates of apneas, hypopneas, respiratory disturbance indexes, apnea hypopnea indexes, lower oxygen saturation nadirs, and a longer time spent below 90% oxygenation in sleep studies (p < 0.0001). Nearly 45% of the patients with planned ICU stays required respiratory support compared to just 8% of non-PICU patients. Additionally, 32% of the patients with planned ICU stays experienced complications compared to just 8% of the floor population. Complications were associated with younger ages, gastrointestinal comorbidities, technological dependence, viral infections, and a history of reflux. Interestingly, there were no differences in the complication rate by sleep studies findings. Similarly, there were no population level differences between patients who required respiratory support in the ICU and those that did not. Unplanned PICU placement was a rare but significant adverse event (n = 24). None of the hypothesized risk factors were associated with unplanned PICU placement.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study suggest that while our pre-operative referral program for PICU placement is effective in identifying patients needing higher levels of care, the program places many patients in the PICU who did not utilize respiratory support or suffer from complications. We observed some misalignment between characteristics associated with planned ICU stays and actual complications. This suggests that patients with specific clinical histories, not findings on their sleep studies, should be prepared to receive higher levels of care."

Although surgical and cardiac catheterisation-based interventions have been successful in alleviating left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, it remains associated with high morbidity and mortality. Critical aortic stenosis results in elevated left ventricular wall stress, which ultimately increases myocardial oxygen consumption and disrupts coronary artery perfusion during diastole, leading to ventricular dysfunction and cardiogenic shock. Critical care management before definitive intervention should be tailored to optimising oxygen delivery and reducing metabolic consumption of the myocardium and peripheral organ systems. This can be accomplished with prostaglandin infusion to maintain system perfusion through patency of the arterial duct, inotropic support, mechanical ventilation, and central nervous system abrogation. Management should also include a multi-specialty medical team including paediatric cardiothoracic surgeons and paediatric cardiologists with expertise in cardiac catheterisation, imaging, and transplantation."

Single-center retrospective examination of children with HRF transitioned to HFOV. Blood gases and ventilator settings 24 hours prior to and 48 hours after HFOV in survivors and nonsurvivors were evaluated. Sixty-two children with mean age of 7 years and mean weight of 26 kg were included with an observed mortality of 29%. Mean airway pressures (Paw), oxygenation index (OI), arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (P/F) ratio, pH, bicarbonate, and arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure were similar prior to HFOV in survivors and nonsurvivors. During HFOV, mean OI and P/F ratio improved in both groups with an average Paw increase of ∼10 cm H2O. Survivors had lower OI than nonsurvivors (21 ± 0.9 vs. 26.5 ± 2.2; p < 0.01) beginning 24 hours after HFOV. P/F ratio appears to diverge by 36 hours, with survivors having P/F ratio >200. Survivors had higher pH than nonsurvivors at 36 hours (7.40 ± 0.01 vs. 7.32 ± 0.02; p < 0.05), higher bicarbonate levels (27.1 ± 0.7 vs. 23.9 ± 1.3 mEq/L), and similar arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure with less oscillatory support (i.e., hertz and amplitude). Inhaled nitric oxide was used in 53% of patients with improvements in oxygenation but with no effect on mortality. HFOV improves oxygenation in children with severe HRF. Nonsurvivors can be distinguished from survivors at 24 to 36 hours during HFOV by higher OI, metabolic acidosis, and higher oscillatory support. These data may assist in prognostication or timing of initiating alternative therapies, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation."

Pulse oximetry is of utility in perinatal, paediatric, adult and geriatric populations but may require use of age-specific sensors in these groups. It plays a role in the monitoring and treatment of respiratory dysfunction by detecting hypoxaemia and is effective in guiding oxygen therapy in both adult and paediatric populations. Pulse oximetry does not provide information about the adequacy of ventilation or about precise arterial oxygenation, particularly when arterial oxygen levels are very high or very low. Arterial blood gas analysis is the gold standard in these settings. Pulse oximetry may be inaccurate as a marker of oxygenation in the presence of dyshaemoglobinaemias such as carbon monoxide poisoning or methaemoglobinaemia where arterial oxygen saturation values will be overestimated.

The critical need for more standardized studies with one type of intratracheal surfactant and uniform measurements of surfactant proteins and phospholipids by BAL is evident. Further studies will also be needed to elucidate the optimal timing and dosage regimen for different disease processes. Some evidence supports the measurements of surfactant protein levels as markers for predicting the onset and outcome of ARDS and perhaps providing a window for early treatment of patients at risk to develop ARDS.

The symptoms of over ischemia/heart failure may be challenging to distinguish as dyspnea and chest discomfort overlap with those due to COVID-19.

The cytokine release with complement and iNO dysregulation are established mechanisms potentially leading to sepsis-related cardiomyopathy, making sepsis per se one of the potential mechanism leading to acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the hyper-inflammation with endothelial dysfunction is likely be responsible of both pulmonary in-situ platelet aggregation and deep thrombosis potentially leading to severe pulmonary embolism and right ventricular failure.

A written weaning protocol was available in three pediatric centers (10%) and nurses had a key role in the weaning process in 72% of centers. The sudden weaning was the most commonly used procedure, no matter the type of noninvasive ventilatory (NIV) support. The most commonly used criteria for weaning initiation and weaning failure were the degree of respiratory distress, the occurrence of apneas and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2 ). The thresholds commonly used for weaning initiation criteria were (a) none or a slight use of accessory muscles; (b) FiO2 less than equal to 40%, (c) respiratory rate less than 60 per minute, (d) no apnea, (e) blood pH more than 7.30, and (f) partial pressure of venous carbon dioxide less than equal to 50 mm Hg.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In infants with bronchiolitis requiring NIV support, the sudden weaning procedure was the most commonly used strategy.

            "abstract": "## INTRODUCTION\nMost studies have analyzed pre-arrest and resuscitation factors associated with mortality after cardiac arrest (CA) in children, but many patients that reach return of spontaneous circulation die within the next days or weeks. The objective of our study was to analyze post-return of spontaneous circulation factors associated with in-hospital mortality after cardiac arrest in children.\n## METHODS\nA prospective multicenter, multinational, observational study in 48 hospitals from 12 countries was performed. A total of 502 children aged between 1 month and 18 years with in-hospital cardiac arrest were analyzed. The primary endpoint was survival to hospital discharge. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the influence of each post-return of spontaneous circulation factor on mortality.\n## RESULTS\nReturn of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 69.5% of patients; 39.2% survived to hospital discharge and 88.9% of survivors had good neurological outcome. In the univariate analysis, post- return of spontaneous circulation factors related with mortality were pH, base deficit, lactic acid, bicarbonate, FiO2, need for inotropic support, inotropic index, dose of dopamine and dobutamine at 1 hour and at 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation as well as Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and total hospital length of stay. In the multivariate analysis factors associated with mortality at 1 hour after return of spontaneous circulation were PaCO2 < 30 mmHg and >50 mmHg, inotropic index >14 and lactic acid >5 mmol/L. Factors associated with mortality at 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation were PaCO2 > 50 mmHg, inotropic index >14 and FiO2 ≥ 0.80.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nSecondary in-hospital mortality among the initial survivors of CA is high. Hypoventilation, hyperventilation, FiO2 ≥ 0.80, the need for high doses of inotropic support, and high levels of lactic acid were the most important post-return of spontaneous circulation factors associated with in-hospital mortality in children in our population.\n"

            "abstract": "Mortality in cases of severe asthma attacks in children is evaluated at 1%. During initial medical care, repeated evaluation of clinical and para-clinical severity criteria constitutes the main therapeutic guide. Emergency care treatment is based mainly on oxygen therapy, bronchodilatory therapy by discontinuous inhalation, and general corticotherapy. Intravenous theophylline treatment is controversial. The response after a few hours should allow a decision to be made [1] to follow up with outpatient treatment (rapid marked improvement), [2] to continue the hospital treatment (stabilization), or [3] to transfer to intensive care (worsening, exhaustion). In the intensive care unit, the treatment is based on continuous intravenous administration of beta 2 mimetics in addition to the above therapies. The objective is to avoid resorting to assisted ventilation. When this proves necessary, it must not be detrimental; controlled alveolar hypoventilation allows dynamic hyper-inflation linked to ventilation to be reduced. Prevention of relapse is indispensable. This requires hospitalization in a specialized care unit after discharge from intensive care."

Oxygen and warm environment is important during transport, correction of a possible metabolic acidosis and prostaglandin infusion are done in the hospital. Beyond the newborn period, so-called cyanotic spells are seen, particularly in tetralogy of Fallot. In supraventricular tachycardia, vagal manoeuvres can be tried first, if not successful, intravenous adenosine or electroconversion will restore sinus rhythm.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe respiratory failure accesses and returns blood from the venous system and provides non-pulmonary gas exchange. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe cardiac failure or for refractory cardiac arrest (extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR)) provides gas exchange and systemic circulation. The configuration of ECMO is variable, and several pump-driven and pump-free systems are in use. Use of ECMO is associated with several risks. Patient-related adverse events include haemorrhage or extremity ischaemia; circuit-related adverse effects may include pump failure, oxygenator failure and thrombus formation. Use of ECMO in newborns and infants is well established, yet its clinical effectiveness in adults remains uncertain.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The primary objective of this systematic review was to determine whether use of veno-venous (VV) or venous-arterial (VA) ECMO in adults is more effective in improving survival compared with conventional respiratory and cardiac support.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid) on 18 August 2014. We searched conference proceedings, meeting abstracts, reference lists of retrieved articles and databases of ongoing trials and contacted experts in the field. We imposed no restrictions on language or location of publications.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and cluster-RCTs that compared adult ECMO versus conventional support.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all retrieved citations against the inclusion criteria. We independently reviewed full-text copies of studies that met the inclusion criteria. We entered all data extracted from the included studies into Review Manager. Two review authors independently performed risk of bias assessment. All included studies were appraised with respect to random sequence generation, concealment of allocation, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included four RCTs that randomly assigned 389 participants with acute respiratory failure. Risk of bias was low in three RCTs and high in one RCT. We found no statistically significant differences in all-cause mortality at six months (two RCTs) or before six months (during 30 days of randomization in one trial and during hospital stay in another RCT). The quality of the evidence was low to moderate, and further research is very likely to impact our confidence in the estimate of effects because significant changes have been noted in ECMO applications and treatment modalities over study periods to the present.Two RCTs supplied data on disability. In one RCT survival was low in both groups but none of the survivors had limitations in their daily activities six months after discharge. The other RCT reported improved survival without severe disability in the intervention group (transfer to an ECMO centre ± ECMO) six months after study randomization but no statistically significant differences in health-related quality of life.In three RCTs, participants in the ECMO group received greater numbers of blood transfusions. One RCT recorded significantly more non-brain haemorrhage in the ECMO group. Another RCT reported two serious adverse events in the ECMO group, and another reported three adverse events in the ECMO group.Clinical heterogeneity between studies prevented meta-analyses across outcomes. We found no completed RCT that had investigated ECMO in the context of cardiac failure or arrest. We found one ongoing RCT that examined patients with acute respiratory failure and two ongoing RCTs that included patients with acute cardiac failure (arrest).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation remains a rescue therapy. Since the year 2000, patient treatment and practice with ECMO have considerably changed as the result of research findings and technological advancements over time. Over the past four decades, only four RCTs have been published that compared the intervention versus conventional treatment at the time of the study. Clinical heterogeneity across these published studies prevented pooling of data for a meta-analysis.We recommend combining results of ongoing RCTs with results of trials conducted after the year 2000 if no significant shifts in technology or treatment occur. Until these new results become available, data on use of ECMO in patients with acute respiratory failure remain inconclusive. For patients with acute cardiac failure or arrest, outcomes of ongoing RCTs will assist clinicians in determining what role ECMO and ECPR can play in patient care."

Time-weighted mean PaO2 was 14.0 ± 2.4 kPa. Time-weighted mean FiO2 was 49.2 ± 12.1%. Seventy-six (18.1%) patients showed continuous hyperoxia exposure, defined as time-weighted mean PaO2 > 16 kPa. Duration of hyperoxia, hypoxia (PaO2 < 8 kPa) and normoxia (PaO2 8-16 kPa) were 37.9 ± 31.0 h (23.7%), 4.9 ± 9.5 h (3.1%), and 116.8 ± 29.6 h (73.2%). Hyperoxia occurred especially at low to moderate FiO2 in patients of first and second age quartiles (1-57 years) with smaller SAPS2 score. In-hospital mortality of patients with hyperoxia (32.9%) or normoxia did not differ (35.9%; P = 0.691). Conditional logistic regression showed no association between hyperoxia and in-hospital mortality (OR 1.46; 95%CI 0.72-2.96; P = 0.29).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Substantial hyperoxia burden was observed in ICU patients. Young patients with less comorbidities showed hyperoxic episodes more often, especially with lower FiO2 . Hyperoxia during 7 days of mechanical ventilation did not correlate to increased in-hospital mortality."

A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial in infants less than a year of age undergoing cardiac surgery requiring CPB was undertaken. Nitric oxide at a dose of 20 ppm was added to the sweep gas in the treatment group. Blood was collected at baseline and prior to separation from CPB to measure platelet count and function as determined by responsiveness to specific agonists. Clinical outcomes were observed through hospital discharge. Methemoglobin levels were measured preoperatively, at the conclusion of CPB, and upon admission to the ICU. Forty patients consented and were randomized in the trial. Eighteen patients were randomized to the treatment group and 22 were included in the placebo group. The groups were similar in terms of age, weight, gender, and surgical complexity. No significant differences were found in measures of platelet count, platelet response to agonist, or clinical outcomes. Patients in the treatment group had higher methemoglobin levels after receiving nitric oxide, but no levels approached toxicity (maximum 2.4%). Nitric oxide added to the sweep gas of the oxygenator during CPB in infants did not have an appreciable effect on the preservation of platelet count, platelet responsiveness to agonist, or clinical outcomes. Methemoglobin levels were increased after receiving nitric oxide but were far below a toxic level of 15%."

At clinically predetermined intervals ranging from every 1 to 8 hrs, the CI-ABGM measurements of pH, P(CO2), and P(O2) were compared with the values determined by standard intermittent blood gas analysis. The Paratrend 7 system values were individually adjusted to match ABG results when the Paratrend 7 pH differed by greater than +/-0.05 units, P(CO2) was greater than +/-5 torr (0.7 kPa), and P(O2) was greater than +/-15% of the ABG value. Significant aberrations in gas exchange defined as unanticipated events were categorized as isolated metabolic acidosis (pH <7.20), hypercapnia (P(CO2), >70 torr; 9.3 kPa), and hypoxemia (P(O2), <50 torr; 6.7 kPa). All unanticipated events were earmarked from consecutive monitoring epochs ranging from 4 to 24 hrs duration from the time of Paratrend 7 sensor insertion to the time of sensor removal. Fifteen sensors were placed into the radial artery, 34 sensors were placed into the femoral artery, and one sensor was initially placed in the radial and moved to a femoral artery location. Mean radial artery insertion duration was 35 hrs. Mean femoral artery duration was 137.2 hrs. A total of 1445 pairs of ABG results were available for comparison. After removal of individual values, which did not meet inclusion criteria, 1411 pH data pairs, 1408 P(CO2) data pairs, and 1326 P(O2) data pairs were analyzed. The bias and precision for the pH data were 0.00 and 0.04 units, respectively; for the P(CO2) data were -0.4 and 4.8 torr (-0.05 and 0.64 kPa), respectively; and for the P(O2) data 1.0 and 25 torr (0.1 and 3.3 kPa), respectively.

The device is capable of tracking extreme fluctuations in gas exchange with a response rate suitable for making real-time therapeutic decisions. The sensor can be recommended for insertion into a femoral artery cannula. There is a high incidence of blood pressure waveform dampening encountered in radial artery use."

            "abstract": "Past literature has shown that respiratory failure following hematopoietic stem cell transplant is associated with a universally poor outcome with mortality rates approaching 100%. More recent studies have suggested that patient survival is improving. We report our experience with the patients from our institution, a large children's hospital, who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Medical records of 183 patients, who received a bone marrow transplant between 1992 and early 2004, who were <20 yr of age, were retrospectively reviewed. Various factors that might influence mortality were examined. Over the course of the study, the ICU survival increased from 18% during the period 1992-1999 to 59% between 2000 and early 2004. In the latter period, 54% of the patients discharged from the ICU were alive at 100 days post-transplant. Factors that were significant predictors of poor outcome were malignancy as the reason for transplant, dialysis during the ICU stay, or extreme respiratory failure with a ratio of arterial oxygen tension (PaO2)/inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) <300. Analysis of patients who required a high positive end-expiratory pressure or were ventilated with permissive hypercapnia showed that they also had a higher mortality. The impact on survival of factors such as age at time of transplant, graft-vs.-host disease, pneumonia, bacteremia, sepsis, post-transplant days, Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score, engraftment status, or veno-occlusive disease did not reach statistical significance in this cohort. Survival has improved for children who require intensive care following a bone marrow transplant, even for those who require mechanical ventilation. Patients with extreme respiratory failure and those requiring dialysis continue to have poor outcome. Because of an overall improvement in survival, children whose condition following transplant requires intensive care should be treated aggressively."

Animal models of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and congenital diaphragmatic hernia have provided evidence that 'gentle ventilation' with low tidal volumes and 'open-lung' strategies of using positive end-expiratory pressure or high-frequency oscillatory ventilation result in less lung injury than do the traditional modes of mechanical ventilation with high inflating pressures and volumes. Although findings of retrospective studies in infants with respiratory distress syndrome, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn have been similar to those of the animal studies, prospective, randomized, controlled trials have yielded conflicting results.

Mean pH in the first 12 hours was as strongly associated with death as birth weight. Multiple logistic regression models were derived in infants from hospital A using the four traditional risk factors with measures of oxygenation and pH. The validity of each model was then tested in infants from hospital B. The model based on the four traditional risk factors alone predicted death in hospital B with only 31% sensitivity. Adding mean a/AO2 ratio and mean pH increased its sensitivity to 75%, and when mean a/AO2 ratio was replaced by mean FIO2 its sensitivity increased further to 81%. Based on crude mortality rates alone, the odds of death in hospital A versus hospital B were 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.37 to 1.23). After correcting for traditional risk factors and mean FIO2 and mean pH, however, the odds of death in hospital A increased to 3.27 (1.35 to 7.92; p less than 0.01).

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of long-term cardiopulmonary bypass used to treat infants, children, and adults with respiratory and/or cardiac failure despite maximal medical therapy. Mechanical emergencies on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have an associated mortality of 25%. Thus, acquiring and maintaining the technical, behavioral, and critical thinking skills necessary to manage ECMO emergencies is essential to patient survival. Traditional training in ECMO management is primarily didactic in nature and usually complemented with varying degrees of hands-on training using a water-filled ECMO circuit. These traditional training methods do not provide an opportunity for trainees to recognize and interpret real-time clinical cues generated by human patients and their monitoring equipment. Adult learners are most likely to acquire such skills in an active learning environment. To provide authentic, intensive, interactive ECMO training without risk to real patients, we used methodologies pioneered by the aerospace industry and our experience developing a simulation-based training program in neonatal resuscitation to develop a similar simulation-based training program in ECMO crisis management, ECMO Sim.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A survey was conducted at the 19th Annual Children's National Medical Center ECMO Symposium to determine current methods for ECMO training. Using commercially available technology, we linked a neonatal manikin with a standard neonatal ECMO circuit primed with artificial blood. Both the manikin and circuit were placed in a simulated neonatal intensive care unit environment equipped with remotely controlled monitors, real medical equipment and human colleagues. Twenty-five healthcare professionals, all of whom care for patients on ECMO and who underwent traditional ECMO training in the prior year, participated in a series of simulated ECMO emergencies. At the conclusion of the program, subjects completed a questionnaire qualitatively comparing ECMO Sim with their previous traditional ECMO training experience. The amount of time spent engaged in active and passive activities during both ECMO Sim and traditional ECMO training was quantified by review of videotape of each program.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Hospitals currently use lectures, multiple-choice exams, water drills, and animal laboratory testing for their ECMO training. Modification of the circuit allowed for physiologically appropriate circuit pressures (both pre- and postoxygenator) to be achieved while circulating artificial blood continuously through the circuit and manikin. Realistic changes in vital signs on the bedside monitor and fluctuations in the mixed venous oxygen saturation monitor were also effectively achieved remotely. All subjects rated the realism of the scenarios as good or excellent and described ECMO Sim as more effective than traditional ECMO training. They reported that ECMO Sim engaged their intellect to a greater degree and better developed their technical, behavioral, and critical thinking skills. Active learning (eg, hands-on activities) comprised 78% of the total ECMO Sim program compared with 14% for traditional ECMO training (P < 0.001). Instructor-led lectures predominated in traditional ECMO training.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Traditional ECMO training programs have yet to incorporate simulation-based methodology. Using current technology it is possible to realistically simulate in real-time the clinical cues (visual, auditory, and tactile) generated by a patient on ECMO. ECMO Sim as a training program provides more opportunities for active learning than traditional training programs in ECMO management and is overwhelmingly preferred by the experienced healthcare professionals serving as subjects in this study. Subjects also indicated that they felt that the acquisition of key cognitive, technical, and behavioral skills and transfer of those skills to the real medical domain was better achieved during simulation-based training."

Immediately after extubation all patients received supplemental oxygen, administered via mask or nasal cannulae, at a flow rate or concentration sufficient to maintain the pulse oximetric arterial oxygen saturations > 95%; arterial blood gas analyses were performed at 30 minutes after extubation. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of two protocols. Protocol A (our standard management) consisted of (1) three nebulized albuterol treatments administered 1 hour apart, and (2) a chest radiograph obtained within 60 minutes of extubation. Protocol B included one nebulized albuterol treatment administered immediately after extubation. We measured the heart rate, respiratory rate, and arterial blood pressure immediately after and at 60, 120, and 180 minutes following extubation. The following data were also recorded: arterial blood gas analysis results and continuous pulse oximetric arterial oxygen saturation levels. Any significant complications, such as stridor, respiratory distress, or requirement for reintubation, were noted if they occurred within 24 hours of extubation. Patient charge costs were calculated after obtaining the prevailing hospital and physician charges at the time of the study.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eleven patients completed each arm of the study (total = 22). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with respect to arterial pH, serum bicarbonate, pulse oximetric arterial oxygen saturation, arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate (P > .05). Patients treated with Protocol A had a statistically, but not clinically, significant higher mean PaO2 and PaCO2 (P = .02 and P = .05, respectively) than those in Protocol B. Associated charges per patient for Protocol A were $863.50 versus $476.00 for Protocol B. This is a savings of $387.50 per patient. Our pediatric intensive care unit provides care to over 600 intubated patients per year, which would equate to a charge savings of $232,500.00 per year.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      A modified postextubation management protocol, consisting of fewer interventions, resulted in significant patient charge savings with no increased risk to the patient."

Materials and Methods This nationwide population-based cohort study used data from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Patients aged < 75 and > 18 years admitted to an intensive care unit due to acute myocarditis were enrolled and divided into three groups according to mechanical circulatory support (MCS) after excluding major comorbidities. All-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and heart failure hospitalization were evaluated from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2011. Results There were 1145 patients with acute myocarditis (mean age 40.2 years, SD: 14.8 years), of which 851 did not require MCS, 99 underwent intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, and 195 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. There was no significant difference in heart failure hospitalization between the three groups after index admission. The incidence of cardiovascular death after discharge ranged from 10 % to 22%, which was highest in the ECMO group, and was also significantly different between the three groups within 3 months (p<0.001) but it disappeared after 3 months (p=0.458). The trend was also noted in incidence of all-cause mortality. Conclusions The severity of acute myocarditis did not affect long-term outcomes, however, it was associated with cardiovascular/all-cause death within 3 months after discharge."

Administration was given over a period of 7.2+1.4 days. Depth of sedation was monitored by using Comfort- and Hartwig-scores. Observations included continuous monitoring of heart-rate, pulse oxymetry, blood pressure and cerebral tissue oxygenation.Within 4 h post administration of isoflurane a satisfactory increase in the depth of sedation was seen and kept till extubation. 6/15 patients received tracheostomies during the observation period. None of the patients observed suffered life-critical events of the modified application of isoflurane proceeded without complications.

An understanding of the complex physiologic interactions between the respiratory and cardiac systems is essential to optimal patient management. Alterations in intrathoracic pressure are transmitted to the heart and lungs and can dramatically alter cardiovascular performance, with significant differences existing between the physiologic response of the right and left ventricles to changes in intrathoracic pressure. In terms of cardiorespiratory interactions, the clinician should titrate the mean airway pressure to optimize the balance between mean lung volume (ie, arterial oxygenation) and ventricular function (ie, global cardiac output), minimize pulmonary vascular resistance, and routinely monitor cardiorespiratory parameters closely. Oxygen delivery to all organs and tissues of the body should be optimized, but not necessarily maximized.

Although there is a high mortality associated with PRIS, the precise mechanism of action has yet to be determined. The best preventive measure for this syndrome is awareness and avoidance of clinical scenarios associated with development of PRIS. There is no established treatment for PRIS; care is primarily supportive in nature and may include the full array of advanced cardiopulmonary support, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This article reviews the reported cases of PRIS and describes the current understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and treatment options."

The design was a prospective case series involving 7 critical care units of an academic medical center. All patients receiving heliox therapy over a 4-year period were studied, with prospective recording of patient demographics and the location, mode, indication for, and duration of heliox use. Use pattern comparisons based on anatomic location (upper vs lower airway) and age group (pediatric vs adult) were performed by alpha(2) analysis and unpaired Student t test. Eighty-nine patients, aged 17.4 +/- 20.9 years, received heliox for 30.5 +/- 44.6 hours on 92 occasions. Pediatric (</= 18 years) applications accounted for 72.8% of heliox use. Use was greater in frequency and scope during the final 2 study years, particularly in adults. Applications were split between upper airway (47%) and lower airway (53%) disorders. Airway manipulation was required in more adults (7/16) than in children (3/27) with upper airway obstruction (P < .05). The use patterns mirrored current literature emphases on postextubation stridor and asthma. This is the first description of heliox use patterns in the tertiary care critical care environment. Heliox use may be as dependent on practitioner experience as on published data. As a benign and relatively inexpensive therapy, heliox use should continue to be attractive, although ongoing study regarding efficacy in a number of settings is indicated."

More randomized controlled trials are clearly needed for all of the topics presented. Additionally, neonatal and pediatric data are clearly lacking on most of these questions. The key points in many of the conversations on these controversial topics focused on the balance between efficacy and safety. When safety data exist without efficacy data, the uncontrolled variables often become the knowledge, experience, and support available in an individual intensive care unit. \"New\" therapies have the potential to help many patients but also have the potential to do great harm if clinicians do not follow standard guidelines and/or do not have the knowledge to use the therapy appropriately. It is clear that some current standards of care will be overthrown by future data while others will be finally substantiated.

A total of 153 patients aged from 1 to 14 years with acute respiratory failure were enrolled, who were admitted to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of Shanghai Children's Hospital from January 2018 to December 2019. HFNC success was defined as no need for invasive mechanical ventilation and successfully withdrawn from HFNC, while HFNC failure was defined as need for invasive mechanical ventilation. HFNC at a flow rate of 2 L/(kg·min) (maximum ≤ 60 L/min) with inhaled oxygen concentration (FiO2) between 0.30 and 1.00 was applied to maintain percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 0.94-0.97. Parameters including arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide in artery (PaCO2), SpO2 and PaO2/FiO2 were collected before and during the application of HFNC at 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h, as well as over 48 h after HFNC withdrawn. Comparison between the groups was performed by student t test, Mann-Whitney U test or chi-square test. The sensitivity and specificity of the above parameters in predicting HFNC success were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: A total of 153 children (70 males and 83 females) were enrolled. Among them, 131 (85.6%) cases were successfully weaned off from HFNC and 22 (14.4%) failed. The duration of HFNC was 57 (38, 95) hours in the successful group, and the PaO2/FiO2 before HFNC application and after HFNC was withdrawn were 187 (170, 212) mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) and 280 (262, 292) mmHg, respectively.

Also, the SpO2 levels showed the same differences at 1 h (0.96 (0.95, 0.96) vs. 0.94 (0.92, 0.94), Z =-4.812, P<0.01) and 6 h (0.96 (0.95, 0.97) vs. 0.94(0.91, 0.95), Z=-5.024, P<0.01) after HFNC application. Forty eight hours after HFNC was withdrawn, the PaO2 (88.0 (81.7, 95.0) vs. 63.7 (63.3, 66.0) mmHg, Z =-3.032, P<0.01) and SpO2 (0.96 (0.94, 0.98) vs. 0.91 (0.90, 0.92), Z=-3.957, P<0.01) were also significantly higher in the successful group. Regarding the HFNC complications, there was one case with atelectasis and one with pneumothorax in the failure group. HFNC was used as sequential oxygen therapy after extubation in 79 children, successful in all. ROC curve showed that the area under curve of PaO2/FiO2 in predicting HFNC success was 0.990, and the optimal cut-off value was 232 mmHg with the 95%CI of 0.970-1.000 (P<0.01). Conclusions: HFNC could be used as a respiratory support strategy for children with mild to moderate respiratory failure and as a sequential oxygen therapy after extubation. The PaO2/FiO2 when HFNC withdrow is the optimal index to evaluate the success of HFNC application."

Recently, a specialized pulmonary enteral formula (SPEF) was commercially introduced as an adjunct intervention in acute lung injury management. SPEF contains condition-specific nutrients to modulate the inflammatory response. The study examined SPEF impact in critically ill, pediatric burn patients with respiratory failure. Medical records of acute burn patients admitted December 1997 to October 2006 were reviewed for SPEF treatment. Respiratory and renal indices were compared on the first and final days of SPEF use. Nineteen patients with respiratory failure received SPEF for a mean of 10.8 +/- 0.9 days during their acute burn course. Mean age was 5.3 +/- 1.5 years. Mean total body surface area burn was 44.3 +/- 5.4% with 32.5 +/- 6.4% full thickness. Patients were admitted 2.3 +/- 0.9 days postburn. Significant improvements in peak pressure, PEEP, FiO2, P:F ratio, Pco2, Po2, and ETco2 were noted. Seventeen of the 19 patients survived despite the fact that 9 of the 19 patients developed severe barotrauma requiring multiple tube thoracotomies, and all 19 had extremely poor prognoses at SPEF initiation. Adult SPEF formula for critically ill, pediatric burn patients with respiratory failure is safe and well tolerated. SPEF seems to facilitate recovery from acute lung injury as evidenced by improvements in oxygenation and pulmonary compliance."

O2 content is relatively fixed, whereas flow fluctuates by several orders of magnitude. Thus, blood flow volume and distribution vary to maintain coupling between O2 delivery and demand. The trapping, processing and delivery of nitric oxide (NO) by RBCs has emerged as a conserved mechanism through which regional blood flow is linked to biochemical cues of perfusion sufficiency. We will review conventional RBC physiology that influences O2 delivery (O2 affinity & rheology) and introduce a new paradigm for O2 delivery homeostasis based on coordinated gas transport and vascular signaling by RBCs.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      By coordinating vascular signaling in a fashion that links O2 and NO flux, RBCs couple vessel caliber (and thus blood flow) to O2 need in tissue.

            "abstract": "Between Heaven and Hell: Experiences of parents with a critically ill child with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) - A qualitative-explorative study with couple interviews Abstract. Background: It is a traumatic experience for parents when their child's severe illness necessitates a period of intensive care. This situation becomes even more challenging for parents if a highly technical therapy such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit is required. Aim: The study explores the experiences of parents of critically ill children undergoing ECMO therapy with the aim of better understanding their needs and identifying courses of action for healthcare professionals. Method: The qualitative-explorative study was based on interviews with six couples whose critically ill child is or has been receiving ECMO during the last year, which were used to examine their experiences. The analysis of six such interviews was performed using intensive paraphrasing and inductive coding. Results: The parents' situation can be best characterised as ambivalent with simultaneous feelings of hope and fear. They recognize the danger to their child's life, leading to intense feelings of helplessness with strong emotional reactions. It becomes apparent that there is too little fit between the emotional world of the parents and the action patterns of the health care professionals. Conclusions: The health care professionals thinking logic is based on professional criteria, such as the life threat and risks of ECMO, which ignores the emotional needs of the parents. For this reason, it is important to be more sensitive to the parents and to share positive little signs about their child' s state of health and ability to suffer with them."

In each case antiarrhythmic drug therapy caused haemodynamic collapse, requiring emergency ECMO support. Drug therapy on ECMO was not successful. In one patient, the tachycardia was controlled on ECMO with antiarrhythmic drugs, but recurred following ECMO decannulation. Each patient had a successful RFA on ECMO support.

            "abstract": "Respiratory support in paediatric emergency settings ranges from oxygen delivery with subnasal oxygen to invasive mechanical ventilation. Recent data suggest that oxygen can cause reperfusion injuries and should be delivered with caution within well-defined clinical target ranges. Most mild to moderate respiratory distress conditions with an oxygen requirement may benefit from early use of continuous positive airway pressure. High-flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC) is an emerging alternative way to support the inspiratory effort combined with oxygen delivery and positive expiratory pressures without the need of complicated equipment or good compliance from the child. Besides a positive pressure support effect, HFNC therapy reduces the physiological dead space with improved CO2 clearance. A decrease in heart and respiratory rate within the first few hours after initiation of HFNC therapy is likely to identify responders of the treatment. The use of non-invasive ventilation such as continuous positive airway pressure or the use of bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation in emergency departments has increased, and it has been recognised that continuous positive airway pressure support for older children with asthma is particularly efficient."

            "abstract": "Heated, humidified high-flow delivered by nasal cannulae (HHHFNC) is increasingly used for noninvasive respiratory support in preterm infants and critically ill children due to its perceived effectiveness and ease of use. Evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that HHHFNC and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) are equally effective as postextubation support in preterm infants. HHHFNC is also used for weaning preterm infants from CPAP. Data on HHHFNC used as the primary support for treating respiratory distress syndrome are conflicting. HHHFNC use in preterm infants is associated with reduced nasal trauma. Inability to measure the pressure generated by HHHFNC systems is a concern because overexpansion can lead to an air leak and lung injury. Great caution is warranted when HHHFNC is used in extremely low-birth-weight infants (who were rarely included in these randomized controlled trials) because a recent retrospective study found its use is associated with a higher likelihood of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death in this population. HHHFNC has also become popular in pediatric intensive care units and pediatric wards as a method for delivering oxygen and noninvasive respiratory support. Most published studies were conducted on infants and young children with bronchiolitis. The results of a few observational studies and two randomized trials suggest that HHHFNC therapy is effective in the treatment of bronchiolitis. This review discusses the proposed mechanisms of action behind HHHFNC, the results of observational studies, and the evidence emerging from clinical trials on the use of HHHFNC in preterm infants and children critically ill with bronchiolitis."

Ongoing monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation and control of adequate levels of oxygen, pressures, and volumes can decrease the incidence of such adverse outcomes. Use of pulse oximetry became a standard of care for titrating oxygen delivery, but continuous noninvasive monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO2) is not routinely used in NICUs. Continuous monitoring of CO2 level may be crucial because hypocarbia and hypercarbia in extremely preterm infants are associated with lung and brain morbidities, specifically bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and cystic periventricular leukomalacia. It is shown that continuous monitoring of CO2 levels helps in maintaining stable CO2 values within an accepted target range. Continuous monitoring of CO2 levels can be used in the delivery room, during transport, and in infants receiving invasive or noninvasive respiratory support in the NICU. It is logical to hypothesize that this will result in better outcome for extremely preterm infants. In this article, we review the different noninvasive CO2 monitoring alternatives and devices, their advantages and disadvantages, and the available clinical data supporting or negating their use as a standard of care in NICUs."

Anemia decreases oxygen transport which can be harmful in the critically ill patient; it is independently associated with a poor prognosis. The major prophylactic measure against anemia is the limitation of blood draws: several approaches can be used to limit phlebotomy overdraw without harming the patient. Red blood cell transfusion is the quickest way to increase the hemoglobin level, but it is not without risk. It is therefore important to promote the use of evidence-based transfusion strategies. Iron could be useful in case of iron deficiency, but this condition is difficult to diagnose in the critically ill patient.

The patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a recruitable intracardiac shunt between the right and left atrium. We aimed to determine whether body position and oxygen tension affect blood flow through the PFO in healthy adults. We hypothesized that hypoxia and body positions that promote right atrial filling would independently recruit the PFO. Subjects with a PFO (n = 11) performed 11 trials, combining four different fractions of inhaled oxygen (FiO₂) (1.0, 0.21, 0.15, and 0.10) and three positions (upright, supine, and 45° head down), with the exception of FiO₂ = 0.10, while 45° head down. After 5 min in each position, breathing the prescribed oxygen tension, saline bubbles were injected into an antecubital vein and a four-chamber echocardiogram was obtained to evaluate PFO recruitment. We observed a high incidence of PFO recruitment in all conditions, with increased recruitment in response to severe hypoxia and some contribution of body position at moderate levels of hypoxia. We suspect that increased pulmonary vascular pressure, secondary to hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction, increased right atrial pressure enough to recruit the PFO. Additionally, we hypothesize that the minor increase in breathing resistance that was added by the mouthpiece, used during experimental trials, affected intrathoracic pressure and venous return sufficiently to recruit the PFO."

The panel outlined five clinical questions regarding treatment with noninvasive respiratory support techniques [conventional oxygen therapy (COT), high flow nasal cannula, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)] for hypoxaemic patients with acute peri-operative/periprocedural respiratory failure. The goal was to assess the available literature on the various noninvasive respiratory support techniques, specifically studies that included adult participants with hypoxaemia in the peri-operative/periprocedural period. The literature search strategy was developed by a Cochrane Anaesthesia and Intensive Care trial search specialist in close collaboration with the panel members and the ESA group methodologist.

We required worsening oxygenation be sustained for at least 2 days after at least 2 days of stability. We matched patients with a ventilator-associated condition to those without and used Cox proportional hazard models with frailties to examine associations with hospital mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay, and duration of ventilation. The cohort included 8,862 children with 10,209 hospitalizations and 77,751 ventilator days. For the fraction of inspired oxygen 0.25/mean airway pressure 4 definition (i.e., increase in minimum daily fraction of inspired oxygen by 0.25 or mean airway pressure by 4), rates ranged from 2.9 to 3.2 per 1,000 ventilator days depending on ICU type; the fraction of inspired oxygen 0.30/mean airway pressure 7 definition yielded ventilator-associated condition rates of 1.1-1.3 per 1,000 ventilator days. All definitions were significantly associated with greater risk of hospital death, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.6 (95% CI, 0.7-3.4) to 6.8 (2.9-16.0), depending on thresholds and ICU type. Each definition was associated with prolonged hospitalization, time in ICU, and duration of ventilation, among survivors. The advisory board of the study proposed using the fraction of inspired oxygen 0.25/mean airway pressure 4 thresholds to identify pediatric ventilator-associated conditions in ICUs.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Pediatric patients with ventilator-associated conditions are at substantially higher risk for mortality and morbidity across ICUs, regardless of thresholds used.

Qualitative assessments of identified trials were made, and metaanalyses were performed according to Cochrane methodology. Five randomized controlled trials (n = 535) met entry criteria. One study demonstrated significant improvement in oxygenation in the first 4 days of treatment, with no difference after this. There was no difference in ventilator-free days between treatment and placebo groups, and no specific dose of INO was more advantageous than any other. INO had no effect on mortality in trials without crossover of treatment failures to open-label INO (relative risk, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.44). Other clinical indicators of effectiveness, such as duration of hospital and intensive care stay, were inconsistently reported. Lack of data prevented assessment of all outcomes. If further trials assessing INO in acute respiratory distress syndrome or acute lung injury are to proceed, they should be stratified for primary etiology, incorporate other modalities that may affect outcome, and evaluate clinically relevant outcomes before any benefit of INO can be excluded."

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all infants admitted to a PICU at a tertiary care French hospital during the bronchiolitis seasons of 2010/11 and 2011/12. Infants admitted to the PICU, who required noninvasive respiratory support, were included. The first noninvasive respiratory support modality was nCPAP during the 2010/11 season, while HFNC was used during the 2011/2012 season. We compared the length of stay (LOS) in the PICU; the daily measure of PCO2 and pH; and the mean of the five higher values of heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), FiO2, and SpO2 each day, during the first 5 days. Thirty-four children met the inclusion criteria: 19 during the first period (nCPAP group) and 15 during the second period (HFNC group). Parameters such as LOS in PICU and oxygenation were similar in the two groups. Oxygen weaning occurred during the same time for the two groups. There were no differences between the two groups for RR, HR, FiO2, and CO2 evolution. HFNC therapy failed in three patients, two of whom required invasive mechanical ventilation, versus one in the nCPAP group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We did not find a difference between HFNC and nCPAP in the management of severe bronchiolitis in our PICU.

            "abstract": "A literature review was conducted to assess the evidence for recruitment manoeuvres used in conventional mechanical positive pressure ventilation. A total of 61 studies on recruitment manoeuvres were identified: 13 experimental, 31 ICU, 6 PICU and 12 anaesthesia studies. Recruitment appears to be a continuous process during inspiration and expiration and is determined by peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). Single or repeated recruitment manoeuvres may result in a statistically significant increase in oxygenation; however, this is short lasting and clinically irrelevant, especially in late ARDS and pneumonia. Temporary PIP elevation may be effective but only after PEEP loss (for example disconnection and tracheal suctioning). Continuous PEEP elevation and prone positioning can increase P(a)O2 significantly. Adverse haemodynamic or barotrauma effects are reported in various studies. No data exist on the effect of recruitment manoeuvres on mortality, morbidity, length of stay or duration of mechanical ventilation. Although recruitment manoeuvres can improve oxygenation, they can potentially increase lung injury, which eventually determines outcome. Based on the presently available literature, prone position and sufficient PEEP as part of a lung protective ventilation strategy seem to be the safest and most effective recruitment manoeuvres. As paediatric physiology is essentially different from adult, paediatric studies are needed to determine the role of recruitment manoeuvres in the PICU."

Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) can be used as a \"bridge to recovery\". ECMO is a complex network that provides oxygenation and ventilation and allows the lungs to rest and recover from respiratory failure, while minimizing iatrogenic ventilator-induced lung injury. In the critical care settings, ECMO is shown to improve survival rates and outcomes in patients with severe ARDS. The primary objective was to present an innovative approach for using high-fidelity medical simulation before setting ECMO program for reversible respiratory failure (RRF) in Poland's first unique regional program \"ECMO for Greater Poland\", covering a total population of 3.5 million inhabitants in the Greater Poland region (Wielkopolska).\n    \n\n\n          Aim and methods:\n        \n      \n      Because this organizational model is complex and expensive, we use advanced high-fidelity medical simulation to prepare for the real-life implementation. The algorithm was proposed for respiratory treatment by veno-venous (VV) Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). The scenario includes all critical stages: hospital identification (Regional Department of Intensive Care) - inclusion and exclusion criteria matching using an authorship protocol; ECMO team transport; therapy confirmation; veno-venous cannulation of mannequin's artificial vessels and implementation of perfusion therapy and transport with ECMO to another hospital in a provincial city (Clinical Department of Intensive Care), where the VV ECMO therapy was performed in the next 48 h, as training platform.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The total time, by definition, means the time from the first contact with the mannequin to the cannulation of artificial vessels and starting VV perfusion on ECMO, did not exceed 3 h - including 75 min of transport (the total time of simulation with first call from provincial hospital to admission to the Clinical Intensive Care department was 5 h). The next 48 h for perfusion simulation \"in situ\" generated a specific learning platform for intensive care personnel. Shortly after this simulation, we performed, the first in the region: ECMO used for RRF treatment. The transport was successful and exceeded 120 km. During first year of Program duration we performed 6 successful ECMO transports (5 adult and 1 paediatric) with 60% of adult patient survival of ECMO therapies.

Because such infants are susceptible to major fluctuations in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation would increase the likelihood for the changes in CBF that could result in GMH-IVH and PVL. The objectives of this study were to determine whether a state of impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation could be identified reliably and conveniently at the bedside, the frequency of any such impairment, and the relation of the impairment to the subsequent occurrence of severe GMH-IVH and PVL.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      To monitor the cerebral circulation continuously and noninvasively, we used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine quantitative changes in cerebral concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO(2)) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) from the first hours of life. Our previous experimental study showed a strong correlation between a measure of cerebral intravascular oxygenation (HbD), ie, HbD = HbO(2) - Hb, determined by NIRS, and volemic CBF, determined by radioactive microspheres. We studied 32 very low birth weight premature infants (gestational age: 23-31 weeks; birth weight: 605-1870 g) requiring mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen, and invasive blood pressure monitoring by NIRS from 1 to 3 days of age.

Pearson correlations were used to compare heparin dose and activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and anti-Factor Xa assay. Analysis showed negative Pearson correlations in 11 of 17 patients between the activated clotting time and heparin, as compared with seven of 17 for activated partial thromboplastin time and only one for heparin and anti-Factor Xa assay.

            "title": "The future of Cochrane Neonatal.",
            "abstract": "Cochrane Neonatal was first established in 1993, as one of the original review groups of the Cochrane Collaboration. In fact, the origins of Cochrane Neonatal precede the establishment of the collaboration. In the 1980's, the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at Oxford, led by Dr. Iain Chalmers, established the \"Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials\" (ODPT), a register of virtually all randomized controlled trials in perinatal medicine to provide a resource for reviews of the safety and efficacy of interventions used in perinatal care and to foster cooperative and coordinated research efforts in the perinatal field [1]. An effort that was clearly ahead of its time, ODPT comprised four main elements: a register of published reports of trials; a register of unpublished trials; a register of ongoing and planned trials; and data derived from pooled overviews (meta-analyses) of trials. This core effort grew into the creation of the seminal books, \"Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth\" as well as \"Effective Care of the Newborn Infant\" [2,3]. As these efforts in perinatal medicine grew, Iain Chalmers thought well beyond perinatal medicine into the creation of a worldwide collaboration that became Cochrane [4]. The mission of the Cochrane Collaboration is to promote evidence-informed health decision-making by producing high-quality, relevant, accessible systematic reviews and other synthesized research evidence (www.cochrane.org). Cochrane Neonatal has continued to be one of the most productive review groups, publishing between 25 tpo to 40 new or updated systematic reviews each year. The impact factor has been steadily increasing over four years and now rivals most of the elite journals in pediatric medicine. Cochrane Neonatal has been a worldwide effort. Currently, there are 404 reviews involving 1206 authors from 52 countries. What has Cochrane done for babies? Reviews from Cochrane Neonatal have informed guidelines and recommendations worldwide. From January 2018 through June 2020, 77 international guidelines cited 221 Cochrane Neonatal reviews. These recommendations have included recommendations of the use of postnatal steroids, inhaled nitric oxide, feeding guidelines for preterm infants and other core aspects of neonatal practice. In addition, Cochrane Reviews has been the impetus for important research, including the large-scale trial of prophylactic indomethacin therapy, a variety of trials of postnatal steroids, trials of emollient ointment and probiotic trials [6]. While justifiably proud of these accomplishments, one needs to examine the future contribution of Cochrane Neonatal to the neonatal community. The future of Cochrane Neonatal is inexorably linked to the future of neonatal research. Obviously, there is no synthesis of trials data if, as a community, we fail to provide the core substrate for that research. As we look at the current trials' environment, fewer randomized controlled trial related to neonates are being published in recent years. A simple search of PubMed, limiting the search to \"neonates\" and \"randomized controlled trials\" shows that in the year 2000, 321 randomized controlled trials were published. These peaked five years ago, in 2015, with close to 900 trials being published. However, in 2018, only 791 studies are identified. Does this decrease represent a meaningful change in the neonatal research environment? Quite possibly. There are shifting missions of clinical neonatology at academic medical institutions, at least in the United States, with a focus on business aspects as well as other important competing clinical activities. Quality improvement has taken over as one of the major activities at both private and academic neonatal practices. Clearly, this is a needed improvement. All units at levels need to be dedicated to improving the outcomes of the sick and fragile population we care for. However, this need not be at the expense of formal clinical trials. It is understandable that this approach would be taken. Newer interventions frequently relate to complex systems of care and not the simple single interventions. Even trials that might traditionally have been done as randomized controlled trials, such as the introduction of a new mode of ventilation, are in reality complex challenges to the ability of institutions to create systems to adapt to these new technologies. Cost of doing trials has always been a barrier. The challenging regulatory and ethical environment contributes to these problems as well [7]. Despite these barriers, how does the research agenda of the neonatal community move forward in the 21st Century? We need to reassess how we create and disseminate our research findings. Innovative trial designs will allow us to address complex issues that we may not have tackled with conventional trials. Adaptive designs may allow us to look at potentially life-saving therapies in a way that feel more efficient and more ethical [8]. Clarifying issues such as the use of inhaled nitric oxide in preterm infants would be greatly served if we even knew whether or not there are hypoxemic preterm infant who would benefit from this therapy [9]. Current trials do not suggest so, yet current practice tells us that a significant number of these babies will receive inhaled nitric oxide [10-13]. Adaptive design, such as those done with trials of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), would allow us to quickly assess whether, in fact, these therapies are life-saving and allow us to consider whether or not further trials are needed [14,15]. Our understanding that many interventions involve entire systems approaches does not relegate us only to doing quality improvement work. Cluster designs may allow us to test more complex interventions that have usually been under the purview of quality improvement [16-18]. Cluster trials are well suited for such investigations and can be done with the least interruption to ongoing care. Ultimately, quality improvement is the application of the best evidence available (evidence-based medicine is \"what to do\" and evidence-based practice is \"how to do\"). [19,20]. Nascent efforts, such as the statement on \"embedding necessary research into culture and health\" (the ENRICH statement) call for the conduct of large, efficient pragmatic trials to evaluate neonatal outcomes, as in part called for in the ALPHA Collaboration [21,22]. This statement envisions an international system to identify important research questions by consulting regularly with all stakeholders, including patients, public health professionals, researchers, providers, policy makers, regulators, funders of industry. The ENRICH statement envisions a pathway to enable individuals, educational institutions, hospitals and health-care facilities to confirm their status as research-friendly by integrating an understanding of trials, other research and critical thinking and to teaching learning and culture, as well as an engagement with funders, professional organizations and regulatory bodies and other stake holders to raise awareness of the value of efficient international research to reduce barriers to large international pragmatic trials and other collaborative studies. In the future, if trials are to be done on this scale or trials are prospectively designed to be analyzed together, core outcome measures must be identified and standardized. That clinical trials supply estimates of outcomes that are relevant to patients and their families is critical. In addition, current neonatal research evaluates many different outcomes using multiple measures. A given measure can have multiple widely used definitions. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (or chronic lung disease just to add to the confusion) quickly comes to mind [23,24]. The use of multiple definitions when attempting to measure the same outcome prevents synthesis of trial results and meta-analysis and hinders efforts to refine our estimates of effects. Towards that end, Webbe and colleagues have set out to develop a core outcome set for neonatal research [25]. Key stakeholders in the neonatal community reviewed multiple outcomes reported in neonatal trials and qualitative studies. Based on consensus, key outcome measures were identified, including survival, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, brain injury on imaging, retinopathy or prematurity, gross motor ability, general cognitive ability, quality of life, adverse events, visual impairment or blindness, hearing impairment or deafness, chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Trials registration has to be a continued focus of the neonatal community. Trials registration allows for systematic reviewers to understand whether or not reporting bias has occurred [26]. It also allows for transparent incorporation of these core outcome measures. Ultimately, trials registration should include public reporting of all of these core outcomes and, in the future, access to data on an individual level such that more sophisticated individual patient data meta-analysis could occur. Lastly, there is no reason to see clinical trials and quality improvement as separate or exclusive activities. In fact, in the first NICQ Collaborative, conducted by Vermont Oxford Network, participation in a trial of postnatal steroids was considered part of the quality improvement best practices as opposed to simply choosing an as-of-yet unproven approach to use of this potent drug [27]. What role will Cochrane Neonatal play as we move forward in the 21st Century? As the neonatal community moves forward with its' research agenda, Cochrane Neonatal must not only follow but also lead with innovative approaches to synthesizing research findings. Cochrane Neonatal must continue to work closely with guideline developers. The relationship between systematic review production and guideline development is clearly outlined in reports from the Institute of Medicine [28,29]. Both are essential to guideline development; the systematic review group culling the evidence for the benefits and harms of a given intervention and the guideline group addressing the contextual issues of cost, feasibility, implementation and the values and preferences of individuals and societies. Most national and international guidelines groups now routinely use systematic reviews as the evidence basis for their guidelines and recommendations. Examples of the partnership between Cochrane Neonatal and international guideline development can be seen in our support of the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on the use of vitamin A or the soon to be published recommendations from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) on cord management in preterm and term infants [30]. In the future, we need to collaborate early in the guideline development process so that the reviews are fit for purpose and meet the needs of the guideline developers and the end users. Towards this end, all Cochrane Neonatal reviews now contain GRADE assessments of the key clinical findings reported in the systematic review [31]. Addition of these assessments addresses the critical issue of our confidence in the findings. We are most confident in evidence provided by randomized controlled trials but this assessment can be can be downgraded if the studies that reported on the outcome in question had a high risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency of results, or imprecision, or where there is evidence of reporting bias. Information provided by GRADE assessments is seen as critical in the process of moving from the evidence to formal recommendations [32]. We need to explore complex reviews, such as network (NMA) or multiple treatment comparison (MCT) meta-analyses, to address issues not formally addressed in clinical trials [33]. In conditions where there are multiple effective interventions, it is rare for all possible interventions to have been tested against each other [34]. A solution could be provided by network meta-analysis, which allows for comparing all treatments with each other, even if randomized controlled trials are not available for some treatment comparisons [34]. Network meta-analysis uses both direct (head-to-head) randomized clinical trial (RCT) evidence as well as indirect evidence from RCTs to compare the relative effectiveness of all included interventions [35]. However, Mills and colleagues note that the methodological quality of MTCs may be difficult for clinicians to interpret because the number of interventions evaluated may be large and the methodological approaches may be complex [35]. Cochrane Neonatal must take a role in both the creation of such analyses and the education of the neonatal community regarding the pitfalls of such an approach. The availability of individual patient data will make more sophisticated analyses more available to the community. Although the current crop of individual patient data meta-analyses (including the reviews of elective high frequency ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide and oxygen targets) have not differed substantially from the findings of the trials level reviews (suggesting that, in fact, sick neonates are more alike that unalike), there still will be a large role for individual patient data meta-analysis, at least to end the unfound conclusions that these therapies are effective in various subgroups (be it issues of sex, disease severity, or clinical setting) [36-39]. Future trials should take a lesson from the NeOProM Collaborative [37,39]. Given the difficulty in generating significant sample size and creating funding in any single environment, trials with similar protocols should be conducted in a variety of healthcare settings with an eye towards both study level and individual patient level meta-analysis at the conclusion of those trials, allowing for broader contribution to the trials data, more rapid accrual of sample size, and more precise results. We need to educate the neonatal community regarding the use and abuse of diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests are a critical component of healthcare but also contribute greatly to the cost of medical care worldwide. These costs include the cost of the tests themselves and the costs of misdiagnosis and treatment of individuals who will not benefit from those treatments. Clinicians may have a limited understanding of diagnostic test accuracy, the ability of a diagnostic test to distinguish between patients with and without the disease or target condition [41,42]. Efforts such as Choosing Wisely have tried to identify these deficiencies [40]. As Cochrane has increased the general literacy of both the medical and general population regarding the interpretation of the results of interventions on various diseases, so should Cochrane move forward and improve the understanding of diagnostic testing. We need to become more efficient at creating and maintaining our reviews. The time spent to produce systematic reviews is far too great. In average, it takes between 2½ to 6½ years to produce a systematic review, requiring intense time input for highly trained and expensive experts. Innovations in the ways in which we produce systematic reviews can make the review process more efficient by outsourcing some of the tasks or crowdsourcing to machine learning. We need to let the crowd and machine learning innovations help us sort the massive amounts of information needed to conduct systematic reviews. It can also allow for \"live\" updating of critical reviews where the research landscape is quickly changing [43]. Lastly, Cochrane Neonatal must focus more on users of the reviews and not necessarily authors of the reviews. Current Cochrane programming speaks of Cochrane training with an eye towards developing the skills of individuals who will conduct systematic reviews. While this is clearly needed and laudable, the fact of the matter is that most of the community will be \"users\" of the reviews. Individuals who need to understand how to use and interpret the findings of systematic reviews. These review users include clinicians, guideline developers, policy makers and families. Incorporation of GRADE guidelines has been a huge step in adding transparency to the level of uncertainty we have in our findings. From a family's perspective, we need to overcome the environment of mistrust or misunderstanding of scientific evidence and how we convey what we know, and our uncertainty about what we know, to parents and families."

How the brain oxygen saturation (rSO2) values change with the cardiac restoration and the process of growth during these procedures in individual children remains unknown. In this study, we retrospectively studied rSO2 data as well as the perioperative clinical records of 30 children who underwent both Glenn and Fontan procedures by the same surgeon in the same institute. The rSO2 was measured at the beginning and end of each procedure with an INVOS 5100C. Cerebral perfusion pressure was calculated by subtracting central venous pressure from mean arterial pressure. Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and the hemoglobin concentration were obtained as candidates affecting rSO2 changes at the start and the end of both procedures. The rSO2 increased during the Glenn procedure, but this increase was slight and insignificant. On the other hand, the rSO2 significantly increased during the Fontan procedure. Significant increases in SaO2 were observed only between the beginning and end of the Fontan procedure. Correlation coefficients determined by linear regression analysis were more than 0.5 between rSO2 and SaO2 in both procedures. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that SaO2 was the key determinant of the rSO2. The rSO2 increases step by step from the Glenn to the Fontan procedure in the same patient. Within each procedure, SaO2 is the key determinant of the rSO2. The significance of rSO2 monitoring in these procedures should be further evaluated."

An acute rise of RV afterload, either as exacerbating chronic PH of different aetiologies (eg, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), chronic lung or congenital heart disease), or pulmonary hypertensive crisis after corrective surgery for congenital heart disease, may lead to severe circulatory compromise. Only few clinical studies provide evidence on how to best treat children with acute severe PH and decompensated RV function, that is, acute RV failure. The specific treatment in the intensive care unit should be based on the underlying pathophysiology and not only be focused on so-called 'specific' or 'tailored' drug therapy to lower RV afterload. In addition therapeutic efforts should aim to optimise RV preload, and to achieve adequate myocardial perfusion, and cardiac output. Early recognition of patients at high risk and timely initiation of appropriate therapeutic measures may prevent the development of severe cardiac dysfunction and low cardiac output. In patients not responding adequately to pharmacotherapy, (1) novel surgical and interventional techniques, temporary mechanical circulatory support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, (2) pumpless lung assist devices (3) and/or lung or heart-lung transplantation should be timely considered. The invasive therapeutic measures can be applied in a bridge-to-recovery or bridge-to-lung transplant strategy.

Physicians often justify RBC transfusions in critically ill children when anaemia is present because of the assumption that by increasing the haemoglobin level the delivery of oxygen (DO2) to peripheral tissues is improved so that ultimately the oxygen utilization (VO2) can be improved. However, the question whether or not the presence of anaemia in critically ill children is associated with adverse outcome cannot be answered easily. The TRIPICU study has clearly shown that it is safe to refrain from transfusing stable critically ill children unless their Hb has dropped below 7 g/dL (4.3 mmol/L) as increasing data emphasizes that the common practice of transfusing critically ill children is not free from causing harm as shown by increased morbidity and mortality. This narrative review summarizes the current literature and discusses possible pathophysiological mechanisms."

            "abstract": "The introduction of pulse oximetry in clinical practice has allowed for simple, noninvasive, and reasonably accurate estimation of arterial oxygen saturation. Pulse oximetry is routinely used in the emergency department, the pediatric ward, and in pediatric intensive and perioperative care. However, clinically relevant principles and inherent limitations of the method are not always well understood by health care professionals caring for children. The calculation of the percentage of arterial oxyhemoglobin is based on the distinct characteristics of light absorption in the red and infrared spectra by oxygenated versus deoxygenated hemoglobin and takes advantage of the variation in light absorption caused by the pulsatility of arterial blood. Computation of oxygen saturation is achieved with the use of calibration algorithms. Safe use of pulse oximetry requires knowledge of its limitations, which include motion artifacts, poor perfusion at the site of measurement, irregular rhythms, ambient light or electromagnetic interference, skin pigmentation, nail polish, calibration assumptions, probe positioning, time lag in detecting hypoxic events, venous pulsation, intravenous dyes, and presence of abnormal hemoglobin molecules. In this review we describe the physiologic principles and limitations of pulse oximetry, discuss normal values, and highlight its importance in common pediatric diseases, in which the principle mechanism of hypoxemia is ventilation/perfusion mismatch (eg, asthma exacerbation, acute bronchiolitis, pneumonia) versus hypoventilation (eg, laryngotracheitis, vocal cord dysfunction, foreign-body aspiration in the larynx or trachea). Additional technologic advancements in pulse oximetry and its incorporation into evidence-based clinical algorithms will improve the efficiency of the method in daily pediatric practice."

Patients who underwent pediatric cardiac surgery under CPB between September 2015 and September 2017 were enrolled in this study. Patients monitored with both cerebral and renal rSO2 at the beginning of surgery were included. The primary outcome was the prediction of outcomes after pediatric cardiac surgery. Outcome was defined as any of: (1) death within 30 days after surgery, or the need for (2) renal replacement therapy or (3) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, (4) shorten mechanical ventilator-free day,(5) shorten ICU-free survival day. We included 59 patients: cyanotic n = 31; non-cyanotic n = 28. Among all patients, 15 (25%) had poor outcomes, including three deaths. The cerebral and renal rSO2 values were significantly lower in the cyanotic patients with poor outcomes compared to those without poor outcomes (cerebral: 59 ± 11 vs. 50 ± 5, p = 0.021; renal: 59 ± 15 vs. 51 ± 14, p = 0.015) but only the renal rSO2 value was significantly lower in the non-cyanotic patients (77 ± 10 vs. 61 ± 14, p = 0.011).

Due to the heterogenous lung volumes seen, the application of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) can have both beneficial and deleterious effects. Alternating supine and prone positioning may be beneficial in ARDS by providing more homogenous distribution of PEEP and decreasing intrapulmonary shunt. In pediatrics, the pediatric acute lung injury and consensus conference (PALICC) recommended to consider it in severe pediatric ARDS (PARDS). Manually prone positioning patients can be burdensome in larger patients. In adults, the use of rotational beds has eased care of these patients. There is little published data about rotational bed therapy in children. Therefore, we sought to describe the use of a rotational bed in children with PARDS. We performed a retrospective case series of children who utilized a rotational bed as an adjunctive therapy for their PARDS. Patient data were collected and analyzed. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed and reported. Oxygenation indices (OI) pre- and post-prone positioning were analyzed. Twelve patients with PARDS were treated with a rotational bed with minimal adverse events. There were no complications noted. Three patients had malfunctioning of their arterial line while on the rotational bed. Oxygenation indices improved over time in 11 of the 12 patients included in the study while on the rotational bed. Rotational beds can be safely utilized in pediatric patients. In larger children with PARDS, where it may be more difficult to perform a manual prone position, use of a rotational bed can be considered a safe alternative."

During normoxic conditions, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance ratio (PVR/SVR) were 34 +/- 3 mm Hg and 0.42 +/- 0.07, respectively.

Echocardiography showed left ventricular dysfunction in all and additional right ventricular dysfunction in four patients. ECG showing widespread ST changes as well as elevated troponin I indicated myocardial damage. All patients were cannulated onto ECMO shortly after ICU admission. None of the patients suffered cardiac arrest prior to ECMO initiation. Four patients survived ECMO and three survived to hospital discharge. All three survivors showed complete cardiac recovery after a median follow-up of 34 months. The survival rate in 35 previously reported cases was 34% (12/35) and including our seven cases 36% (15/42).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this case series, ECMO initiation prevented further deterioration and cardiac arrest in neonates with severe EV myocarditis and not responding to conventional medical therapies. Moreover, complete cardiac recovery occurred in survivors. However, these neonates may need long ECMO runs and are at increased risk for mechanical complications. Furthermore, mortality remains high due to greater disease severity."

We compared the accuracy and reliability of a disposable vascular pressure device (DVPD) with the gold standard (ie, the transducer pressure bag invasive arterial monitoring system) used in intensive care units to determine if the DVPD can be reliably used in place of the traditional pressure transducer setup.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study was a single-center, prospective, observational study performed in the adult intensive care unit of a large academic university hospital. A convenience cohort of hemodynamically stable, adult critically ill patients with femoral, brachial, or radial arterial catheters was recruited for this study. The Compass pressure device (Centurion Medical Products, Williamston, MI) is a disposable vascular pressure-sensing device used to assure venous access versus inadvertent arterial access during central line placement. The DVPD was attached to an in situ arterial catheter and measures the mean intravascular pressure via an embedded sensor and displays the pressure via the integrated LCD screen. Using a 3-way stopcock, the DVPD was compared with the standard arterial setup. We compared the mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the standard setup with the DVPD using Bland-Altman plots and methods that accounted for repeated measures in the same subject.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Data were collected on 14 of the 15 subjects enrolled. Five measurements were obtained on each patient comparing the DVPD with the standard arterial setup at 1-minute intervals over the course of 5 minutes. A total of 70 observations were made. Among the 15 subjects, most (10 [67%]) were radial or brachial sites. The average MAP scores and standard deviation values obtained by the standard setup were 83.5 mm Hg (14.8) and 81.1 mm Hg (19.3) using the DVPD. Just over half (51.4%) of the measurements were within a ± 5-mm Hg difference. Using Bland-Altman plotting methods, standard arterial measurements were 2.4 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval, 0.60-4.1) than with the DVPD. Differences between the 2 devices varied significantly across MAP values. The standard arterial line measurements were significantly higher than the DVPD at low MAP values, whereas the DVPD measurements were significantly higher than the standard arterial line at high MAP values.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The DVPD provides a reasonable estimate of MAP and may be suitable for arterial pressure monitoring in settings where standard monitoring setups are not available. The DVPD appears to provide \"worst-case\" values because it underestimates low arterial blood pressure and overestimates high arterial blood pressure. Future trials should investigate the DVPD under different physiological conditions (eg, hypotensive patients, patients with ventricular assist devices, and patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), different patient populations (such as pediatric patients), and in different environments (prehospital, air medical transport, and austere locations)."

Nevertheless, HFOV is still frequently used as rescue therapy in paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). In view of the limited evidence for HFOV in PARDS and evidence demonstrating harm in adult patients with ARDS, we hypothesized that HFOV use compared to other modes of mechanical ventilation is associated with increased mortality in PARDS.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients with PARDS from 10 paediatric intensive care units across Asia from 2009 to 2015 were identified.

The primary outcome was 28-day mortality and secondary outcomes were 28-day ventilator- (VFD) and intensive care unit- (IFD) free days. Genetic matching (GM) method was used to analyse the association between HFOV treatment with the primary outcome. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis, including propensity score (PS) matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and marginal structural modelling (MSM) to estimate the treatment effect.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 328 patients were included.

The use of terlipressin (triglycyl-lysine-vasopressin), an analog of vasopressin with a longer duration of action, recently emerged as a treatment of hypotension not responsive to vasopressors and inotropes. This was a retrospective study set in an 18-bed pediatric critical care department in a tertiary care children's hospital. We reviewed the files of all children with septic shock who were treated with terlipressin between January 2003 and February 2004. Fourteen children (mean age, 5.6 years; range, 4 days to 17.7 years) were treated with terlipressin in 16 septic shock episodes. Significant improvements in respiratory and hemodynamic indices were noted shortly after treatment. Mean arterial blood pressure increased significantly from 54 +/- 3 to 72 +/- 5 mmHg 10 min after terlipressin administration (P = 0.001). Heart rate decreased from 153.0 +/- 6.5 beats/min to 138.0 +/- 7.5 beats/min 12 h after treatment onset (P = 0.003). Epinephrine infusion was decreased or stopped in eight patients after terlipressin administration. Urine output increased from 1.6 +/- 0.5 mL/kg/h to 4.3 +/- 1.2 mL/kg/h 1 h after treatment onset (P = 0.011). PaO2 increased from 95.1 +/- 12.3 mmHg to 110.1 +/- 20.5 mmHg, and the oxygenation index decreased from 10.2 +/- 2.2 to 9.2 +/- 1.7. Terlipressin treatment of hypotension due to septic shock was successful in eight out of 16 episodes. Six of the 14 patients with poor prognosis for survival recovered.

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate three commercially available ECLS systems with rotary pumps in terms of circuit pressure, pressure drop, perfusion modes, and hemodynamic energy transmission in a simulated adult cardiogenic shock model. One circuit consisted of a Cardiohelp system, which included a Cardiohelp console and HLS Module Advanced 7.0 tubing set with integrated centrifugal pump and oxygenator. The alternative circuit was composed of a Quadrox-D Adult oxygenator connected in series with either an i-cor diagonal pump and console or a Rotaflow centrifugal pump and console. The circuit was primed with lactated Ringer's solution and packed red blood cells (hematocrit 40%). The trials were conducted at flow rates of 1-5 L/min with pseudo patient pressures of 60 mm Hg and 80 mm Hg. Pulsatile flow was tested when using the i-cor system. Mean pre-oxygenator pressure and pressure drop across ECLS circuit (including oxygenator and arterial tubing) were lower when using the Cardiohelp system as compared to the Rotaflow and i-cor systems (P < 0.01). The i-cor system was able to deliver more hemodynamic energy to the pseudo patient because of its ability to produce pulsatile flow (P < 0.01). The Cardiohelp HLS Module Advanced 7.0 integrated oxygenator had a lower resistance than the Quadrox-D oxygenator. Although the compact Cardiohelp system had a better hemodynamic performance when compared to Rotaflow and i-cor systems, the pulsatile flow of the i-cor system delivered more hemodynamic energy to the pseudo patient. This may render more physiological benefits in high-risk patients on ECLS."

            "abstract": "The cerebral fractional oxygen extraction (FOE) reflects the balance between cerebral oxygen delivery (OD) and consumption (VO(2)). PCO(2) affects the cerebral blood flow (CBF): hypocapnia decreases CBF and OD and increases FOE. We recently showed that the fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) reflects FOE and hypothesized that a decrease in tPCO(2) increases FTOE. In this study we looked at the effect of changes in tPCO(2) on FTOE. We analysed 23 measurements in 13 neonates with birth weight below 1500 g and need for intensive care. Exclusion criteria were congenital malformations or cerebral complications. The tissue oxygenation index (TOI), tPCO(2), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), heart rate (HR) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) were continuously recorded for 4h during the first days of life and FTOE was calculated. Over the whole group we found a significant negative (r=-0.227) correlation between tPCO(2) and FTOE and a significant positive (r=0.258) correlation between tPCO(2) and TOI. After correction for MABP these correlations remained significant. Over the whole group we found a significant positive correlation between tPCO(2) and TOI and a significant negative correlation between tPCO(2) and FTOE, which remained significant after correction for MABP. This implies that tPCO(2) influences the cerebral oxygenation independently of MABP. We therefore believe that for the interpretation of cerebral oxygenation in mechanically ventilated neonates during the first days of life continuous measurements of tPCO(2) are needed. Moreover we suggest FTOE to become a continuous parameter in the clinical setting for the non-invasive measurement of the neonatal brain oxygenation."

Significant differences in the magnitude of variability for all time scales within and between groups was demonstrated (p < 0.0001).

            "abstract": "In 1950, Allan P. Bloxsom (1901-1991), a pediatrician at the St Joseph Hospital in Houston, introduced his positive pressure oxygen air lock (AL) for the delivery room resuscitation of the asphyxiated newborn. The infant's entire body was placed into a cylindrical steel chamber that was tightly sealed and infused with warmed humidified 60% oxygen. The positive pressure within the AL was cycled between 1 and 3 lb/in(2) at 1-minute intervals to simulate the intrauterine pressures during the second stage of labor. Bloxsom developed the AL device in response to his hypothesis that the contractions of labor help to \"condition: the infant for extrauterine survival. Parmalee said that the AL \"certainly locks the infant up, safe from meddlesome and unintelligent treatment.\" When clear plastic versions of the AL became commercially available, it received widespread use in delivery rooms and newborn nurseries throughout the United States. In 1953, Apgar and Kreiselman produced apnea in adult dogs using pentobarbital and a muscle relaxant, and found that the AL device was unsuccessful with the oxygenation and ventilation of the animals. In 1954, Townsend in Rochester, New York, reported on his experience with the AL in 150 premature infants. He concluded that the AL should be \"more accurately referred to as an oxygenator\" and that, \"the truly apneic infant cannot be maintained in a acyanotic state by the AL.\" The AL was finally subjected to the scrutiny of a randomized, controlled clinical trial that was published in 1956. Reichelderfer and Nitowski at Johns Hopkins randomized 171 infants to receive care in the AL or in an Isolette. Routine resuscitation, including positive pressure ventilation, was administered, as needed, to both study groups before placement into the AL or Isolette (Air Shields Inc, Hatboro, PA). They did not find any differences in the outcomes of the 2 study groups. By the mid 1950s, new information linking oxygen therapy and retrolental fibroplasia, led to a rapid decline in the use of the AL, even before the publication of the randomized trial."

The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency, safety, and outcomes of the high-flow nasal oxygen cannula (HFNC) and conventional oxygen therapy (COT) after extubation in children. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a 13 bed pediatric intensive care unit. One-hundred children who underwent extubation were eligible for the study. Patients were divided into HFNC (n=50) and COT (n=50) groups. Basal variables including heart rate (HR), noninvasive blood pressure, respiratory rate (RR), SpO < sub > 2 < /sub > , SpO < sub > 2 < /sub > /FiO < sub > 2 < /sub > (SF) ratio, and end tidal CO < sub > 2 < /sub > (EtCO < sub > 2 < /sub > ) were obtained initially and recorded at 15, 30, and 45 minutes and at 1, 6, 12 hours, 24 and 48 hours after extubation. SF ratio and SpO < sub > 2 < /sub > increased during the first hour in the HFNC group (p=0.005 and p=0.03, respectively). HR and RR decreased during follow-up in the HFNC group (p=0.001 and p=0.048, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference for PCO < sub > 2 < /sub > after extubation between the two groups. PCO < sub > 2 < /sub > (p=0.008) and EtCO2 (p=0.018) values at 24-h were different between two groups. At follow-up, HR decreased only in the HFNC group (p=0.001) and was different at 12 and 48 hours (p=0.047 and p=0.01, respectively). Initial modified radiologic atelectasis scores (m-RAS) were higher for the HFNC group and decreased steadily (p=0.001). Extubation failure rates were 4% and 22% for the HFNC and COT groups, respectively (p=0.007). In conclusion, HFNC is better than COT, especially for the restoration of the respiratory and radiologic parameters. Although more expensive, the use of HFNC may have more advantages to reduce the risk of extubation failure in critically ill children compared with COT."

There has been increasing sharing experience regarding the patient's clinical features over the last weeks which has underlined the need for general guidance on treatment strategies. We summarise the evidence existing in the literature of oxygen and positive pressure treatments in patients at different stages of respiratory failure and over the course of the disease, including environment and ethical issues related to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 infection."

After measurement of baseline values, albuterol was administered and subsequent measurements were performed at 10 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, and 4 hours.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Multidisciplinary PICU in a university teaching hospital.\n    \n\n\n          Patients:\n        \n      \n      Eleven intubated infants and children (five girls, six boys) with a mean age of 20 months (range, 1 mo to 8 yr) and a mean weight of 10.7 kg (range, 3.1-23 kg) who required therapeutic albuterol inhalations.\n    \n\n\n          Intervention:\n        \n      \n      Nine hundred micrograms of albuterol (10 puffs) was administered by a metered-dose inhaler into a spacer through the inspiratory arm of the ventilator circuit near to the patient, during 10 mechanically assisted breaths.\n    \n\n\n          Measurements and main results:\n        \n      \n      All children showed an increase in V'O2 within 10 minutes (mean increase 48.6%). The increased V'O2 was still elevated (42.3% above baseline) at 1 hour, but 3 hours after albuterol inhalation, the V'O2 was back to baseline in all patients. Heart rate increased significantly at 10 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours after inhalation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There is a large increase in V'O2 after albuterol inhalation. This effect lasts up to 3 hours."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Humidified high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy is increasingly available in Australian adult intensive care units. Its use in paediatric populations has been extensively studied and has shown positive effects however its clinical effectiveness in adults has not been established.\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review of the literature was conducted to critique current evidence, inform nursing practice and make recommendations for nursing research.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An extensive search strategy identified clinical studies comparing standard oxygen therapy with high flow therapy in critical care units. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for eligibility, methodological quality and inclusion. Outcomes of interest included oxygenation, ventilation, work of breathing, positive airway pressure, patient comfort and long term effect. A narrative synthesis was conducted to describe the emerging evidence.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Eight studies were included for review. All were abstracts or poster presentations from scientific meetings therefore the quality of data available for analysis was poor. Findings indicated there was preliminary evidence to support the use of high flow therapy to optimise oxygenation in adults. This therapy may reduce the effort of breathing and provide augmented airway pressures. Patients described the therapy as comfortable. No definitive evidence supported the claim that ventilation is improved or conclusively demonstrated a long-term effect.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Humidified high flow nasal cannula may be used as an intermediate therapy to improve oxygenation in adult critical care patients. Further research is required to determine the duration of effect of the therapy, identify the patient population for whom it is most beneficial and evaluate long-term outcomes; to enable definitive recommendations for practice to be made."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Most of the published studies on patients admitted with 2009 pandemic influenza are not population based. We have compiled the clinical information regarding all children admitted with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection during the season 2009-2010 in our defined population, in order to have an unbiased view of the most severe side of the clinical spectrum of the infection and to quantify its burden.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Children <15 years-old admitted to any of 3 hospitals in South-East Spain with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) detected by means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. High quality data were extracted from clinical records specially designed for the pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eighty two children fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The hospitalization rate was 68 per 100,000 children <15 years-old; in those <5 years-old the rate was of 131 and in <1 year-old, 234 per 100,000. An estimated 0.7% of the children who suffered from pandemic influenza were admitted (1.7% in <5 years-old). Intensive care was required for 5% of the hospitalized patients living in the study area. Mortality was roughly estimated about 1 per 100,000 children <15 years-old and was associated with the presence of very severe comorbidities or co-infections. Only 20% of the admitted children were ≥ 5 years-old and without risk factors. The disease followed a generally benign course despite the modest use of oseltamivir (49% of the patients).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Clinical and epidemiological data are very similar to those observed in other places and in interpandemic seasons with a high influenza activity."

            "abstract": "The neonatologist was describing the dire situation, the complexity of the fetus's anomalies, and the options-comfort care, some resuscitation-and finished by saying, \"We would not recommend ECMO …\" \"We would not recommend\" is a curious phrase. There is something ambiguous, very nebulous about it, something passive, noncommittal, maybe even deflective. As a bioethics researcher, I wondered how this phrase is interpreted, how it influences parents' moral deliberation over their options."

Median age and weight of patients were 9 years (interquartile range, 1-15 yr) and 38.5 kg (interquartile range, 12-54.8 kg). Median Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score was 17 (interquartile range, 10-27). Mean epinephrine dose was 1.3 ± 1.1 µg/kg. Median number of doses per patient was two. If more than one dose was provided, median dosing interval was 6.5 minutes. Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were compared at the time of epinephrine administration and 1-4 minutes (median = 1 min) following administration. Heart rate changed from 130 ± 41 to 150 ± 33 beats/min (p < 0.05), and mean arterial blood pressure changed from 51 ± 17 to 75 ± 27 mm Hg (p < 0.001). Variability in mean arterial blood pressure response was observed; nonresponders required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; 66% of doses resulted in up to 100% mean arterial blood pressure increase, and 21% of doses resulted in greater than 100% mean arterial blood pressure increase. Doses below 1 µg/kg were associated with a lower mean arterial blood pressure increase than doses between 1 and 5 µg/kg (mean percent change in mean arterial blood pressure = 6.6% vs 60%, respectively). Children less than or equal to 2 years old had the greatest percentage increase in heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Provision of low-dose bolus epinephrine during periods of acute hypotension can result in a significant increase in mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate. This dosing strategy may provide temporary stabilization while other therapies are added or adjusted, but further research is needed."

Routine clinical assessment of the hemodynamic status of newborn infants is subjective and inaccurate, emphasizing the need for objective monitoring tools. An overview will be provided about the use of neonatologist-performed echocardiography (NPE) to assess cardiovascular compromise and guide hemodynamic management. Different techniques of central blood flow measurement, such as left and right ventricular output, superior vena cava flow, and descending aortic flow are reviewed focusing on methodology, validation, and available reference values. Recommendations are provided for individualized hemodynamic management guided by NPE."
