Background and Purpose—Emerging evidence raises the possibility of an association between depression and stroke risk.
This study sought to examine whether depressive symptoms are associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular
events in a community-based sample.
Methods—A prospective study was conducted on 4120 Framingham Heart Study participants aged 29 to 100 years with
up to 8 years of follow-up. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale was used to measure depressive
symptoms. Incident stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) events were assessed by uniform diagnostic criteria. The
association between depressive symptoms and risk of stroke/TIA was analyzed with Cox proportional-hazards models,
after adjusting for traditional stroke risk factors.
Results—In participants 65 years, the risk of developing stroke/TIA was 4.21 times greater (P0.001) in those with
symptoms of depression. After adjusting for components of the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (hazard ratio3.43,
95% CI1.60 to 7.36, P0.002) and education (hazard ratio4.89, 95% CI2.19 to 10.95), similar results were
obtained. In subjects aged 65 and older, depressive symptoms were not associated with an increased risk of stroke/TIA.
Taking antidepressant medications did not alter the risk associated with depressive symptoms.
Conclusions—In this community-based study, depressive symptoms were an independent risk factor for incident
stroke/TIA in individuals 65 years. These data suggest that identification of depressive symptoms at younger ages may
have an impact on the primary prevention of stroke. (Stroke. 2007;38:16-21.)

epression after stroke has long been recognized as a
common condition with many negative effects.1–5
Whether depression is an antecedent risk factor for stroke has
not been extensively studied, and evidence of this association
remains inconclusive.6,7 Because depression has been associ-
ated with increased rates of cardiovascular disease8,9 and
mortality,8,10,11 it raises the possibility that a similar relation
may exist for cerebrovascular disease.
The relation between age, depression, and stroke has not
been fully explored. However, substantial evidence has
shown that depression is a common condition in the elderly12
and that the incidence rates of stroke increase with age.13
Because the incidence of both depression and stroke increases
with age, we examined the association between antecedent
depression symptoms and risk of stroke according to age.
The objective of the present study was to determine
whether the presence of symptoms indicative of depression at
baseline examination was associated with an increased risk of
stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) in elderly and noneld-
erly participants.
Subjects and Methods
Study Sample
The Framingham Heart Study, an epidemiological study of cardio-
vascular disease including stroke, was established in 1948 as a
longitudinal, community-based, population study. During 1948 to
1950, 5209 men and women (55% women), aged 28 to 62 years and
representing a two-thirds sample of the town of Framingham, Mass,
were enrolled in the study. Since the study’s inception, surviving
original cohort subjects have undergone regular biennial examina-
tions. Beginning in 1971 to 1974, 5124 children of the original
cohort and spouses (offspring cohort) enrolled in the study. Details
of the study design, implementation, and criteria for diagnosis have
been previously published.14,15
The sample for this study consisted of 918 attendees of the original
cohort cycle 22 (1990 to 1992; mean age, 80 years) and 3202
attendees of the offspring cohort cycle 6 (1996 to 1998, mean age, 59
years) who were free of stroke at these examinations, had complete
assessment of depressive symptoms (defined as at least 16 items),
and were available for follow-up of incident stroke/TIA. The Boston
Medical Center institutional review board approved the study, and all
participants provided informed consent.

Depressive Symptoms
Depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Center for Epidemi-
ological Studies Depression scale (CES-D).16 It was administered by
a technician at cohort examination 22 (1990) and offspring exami-
nation 6 (1996) and is a 20-item scale documenting 4 factors:
depressive affect, somatic complaints, positive affect, and interper-
sonal relations, with proven internal consistency, test-retest reliabil-
ity, and construct validity.16,17 Scores on the CES-D range from 0 to
60, with higher scores indicating more symptoms of depression.
According to CES-D guidelines,16 scores of 0 to 15 were indicative
of nondepression, and scores of 16 to 60 were indicative of
depressive symptomatology.
Stroke Case Ascertainment
Because the primary outcome of our study was the occurrence of an
initial cerebrovascular event, we included TIAs along with com-
pleted strokes. Stroke was defined as a focal neurological deficit of
sudden or rapid onset that persisted for 24 hours, and TIA, as a
focal neurological deficit that fully resolved in 24 hours. Contin-
uous surveillance for cerebrovascular events included daily hospital
monitoring, tracking of medical encounters, and examination of
those with possible stroke symptoms. All events were adjudicated by
a panel of at least 2 neurologists, and verification of stroke was
available for 90% of stroke cases by imaging. Stroke occurrence and
characteristics, including subtypes, were determined at the end of the
acute phase of the stroke according to uniform criteria18 and a
standardized protocol.19
Statistical Analyses
Data from the original and offspring cohorts were pooled, and each
subject contributed up to 8 years of follow-up from the baseline
examination to the occurrence of stroke/TIA or censoring (at death,
last examination, loss to follow-up, or 8 years). We considered 2
forms of the CES-D. First, we classified those with CES-D scores of
at least 16 as indicative of depressive symptoms and those with a
score 15 and below as not indicative of depressive symptoms. To
substantiate increments of symptoms, we then used the continuous
CES-D score to assess the risk of incident stroke/TIA associated with
a 10-unit increase in CES-D. We used Cox proportional-hazards
regression modeling to compare individuals with scores indicative of
depressive symptoms with those with scores that were not indicative
of depressive symptoms with respect to incident stroke/TIA and to
estimate the hazard ratio (HR) associated with a 10-unit increase in
CES-D score. Analyses were adjusted for age and sex and then
additionally for components of the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile
(FSRP), including blood pressure, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, cardio-
vascular disease, left ventricular hypertrophy on the ECG, and
current smoking.20 Because the CES-D per se does not diagnose
clinical depression and the use of antidepressant medication may
have an effect on symptoms, we performed a supplementary analysis
wherein the definition of depression was expanded to include those
taking antidepressants, even if their current depressive symptoms
were below the cutoff point. Treatment for depression with antide-
pressants was documented at baseline examination. Antidepressants
included treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic agents, modified cyclics,
and other miscellaneous medications classified as antidepressants.
Anticipating that there might be an interaction between age and
the effect of depressive symptoms on stroke, we performed a test of
interaction. The results of the test confirmed a significant interaction;
thus, all subsequent analyses were performed separately by age
groups (65 years and 65 years). All statistical analyses were
performed with SAS software (version 8.1).21
Results
In this sample of 4120, the mean age was 63.912.3 years
(n2221 65 years, n1899 65 years), 56% were women,
and the majority were married. During the 8-year follow-up
period, there were 228 cerebrovascular events, corresponding
to 144 incident stroke cases (22 hemorrhagic, 122 ischemic)
and 84 TIAs occurring in 102 men and 126 women. For the
total sample at baseline, the mean CES-D score was 6.07.5,
with 439 participants (10.7%) having a score of 16 or greater,
indicative of depressive symptoms. Among those who had
cerebrovascular events, 8.2% of ischemic strokes, 11.9% of
TIAs, and 22.7% of hemorrhagic strokes had scores indica-
tive of depressive symptoms at baseline examination. The
distribution of characteristics within our sample at baseline,
according to age and the presence or absence of depressive
symptoms, are presented in Table 1. Among participants 65
years, those with scores indicative of depressive symptoms
were more likely to be women, to be current smokers, to
consume less alcohol, to be unmarried, and to be taking
antidepressant medications. Among participants 65 years and
older, those with scores indicative of depressive symptoms
were more likely to be women; to have cardiovascular

taking antidepressant medications.
We compared the risk of stroke/TIA in those with and
without depressive symptoms separately for participants 65
years and 65 years. Among participants 65 years, those
who had a CES-D score indicative of depressive symptoms
(Table 2 and Figure 1) were more than 4 times as likely to
have a stroke/TIA than those without depressive symptoms
(HR4.21, 95% CI2.00 to 8.86, P0.001). When we
adjusted for components of the FSRP (HR3.43, 95%
CI1.60 to 7.36, P0.002) or for education (HR4.89, 95%
CI2.19 to 10.95, P0.001), similar results were observed.
To account for the use of antidepressant medications, we
examined those with CES-D scores 16 or taking antidepres-
sant medications and continued to find a significant associa-
tion (HR4.23, 95% CI2.11 to 8.51, P0.001), which
remained after adjusting for components of the FSRP
(HR3.59, 95% CI1.76 to 7.33, P0.001). To further
elucidate the impact of antidepressants, an additional analysis
excluding those taking antidepressants showed a continued
association (HR3.86, 95% CI1.55 to 9.64, P0.004). To
better determine incrementally the influence of depressive
symptoms on risk of stroke/TIA, we examined the impact
associated with a 10-point increase in CES-D score and found
with each 10-point increment an almost doubling of risk for
stroke/TIA (HR1.93, 95% CI1.44 to 2.60, P0.001).
This remained after adjustment for components of the FSRP
(HR1.77, 95% CI1.31 to 2.41, P0.001).
Men and women who were 65 years and had CES-D
scores indicative of depressive symptoms (Table 3 and Figure
2) were not at a significantly higher risk for stroke/TIA than
those who were not depressed (HR0.78, 95% CI0.46 to
1.32, P0.350). After adjusting for components of the FSRP
(HR0.78, 95% CI0.46 to 1.34, P0.374) or for education
(HR0.70, 95% CI0.41 to 1.22, P0.214), similar results
remained. When we examined the effect of CES-D scores

tion with incident stroke/TIA (HR0.94, 95% CI0.60 to
1.46, P0.772); we obtained similar results after adjustment
for components of the FSRP (HR0.93, 95% CI0.59 to

measure, we found no significant association with risk of
stroke/TIA (HR1.03, 95% CI0.85 to 1.25, P0.781), and
again we obtained similar results after adjustment for com-

Discussion
In our community-based sample free of stroke or TIA at
baseline, depressive symptoms were associated with a 4-fold
increased risk of stroke/TIA in men and women 65 years
but not in those 65 years. With up to 8 years of follow-up,
the association between depressive symptoms and risk of
stroke/TIA was observed in those 65 years when depressive
symptoms were treated as either a dichotomous or a contin-
uous measure, when adjusted for traditional risk factors or for
education, or when those taking antidepressants were in-
cluded in the depressive symptom group. To our knowledge,
this is the first community-based study to examine the elderly
and nonelderly groups separately and to document the asso-
ciation between depressive symptoms and stroke risk in those
65 years.
During the past decade, the association between depressive
symptoms and stroke has been examined in a number of
studies, with varying conclusions.7,22,23–29 Several studies
reported that baseline depressive symptoms predicted the risk
of incident stroke,22,23,24 ischemic stroke,7,25 and stroke mor-
tality.24,26 Other studies concluded that depressive symptoms
were not associated with an increased risk of stroke in
general27,28 or with nonfatal ischemic stroke or TIA.29 We
observed an association between antecedent depressive
symptoms and risk of stroke/TIA but only in those below the
age of 65 years. Our results are consistent with 2 previous
studies documenting that baseline depression was not a risk

factor for stroke among individuals aged 60 years28 or 65
years.27 Our findings of an increased risk in the depressed
nonelderly group support those of Gump et al,24 who found an
elevated risk of stroke among men aged 35 to 57 years;
however, that study sample did not include either women or
older men. In contrast, when Jonas and Mussolino22 exam-
ined the risk of stroke in depressed individuals stratified by
age (25 to 59 years and 60 to 74 years), a positive association
was found in both age groups. However, the older age group
in that study did not include individuals 74 years old, thus
not inclusive of the oldest-old.
Previous studies have shown an inconsistent relation be-
tween antidepressants and stroke risk.30–33 In our analysis, the
inclusion of those taking antidepressants, even if their current
depressive symptoms were below the cutoff point, did not
significantly alter the risk of stroke/TIA associated with
baseline depression in either age group. Also, the risk of
stroke/TIA associated with baseline depression in those 65
years was not appreciably altered when those taking antide-
pressants were removed from the analysis.
Several mechanisms have been suggested in an attempt to
explain the relation between antecedent depression and
stroke. Multiple stroke risk factors may contribute to the
association found between depressive symptoms and risk of
stroke. However, when we examined the risk of stroke/TIA in
the lowest quartile of the FSRP, a significant association
remained (data not reported). Some genetic34 and biological
markers that have been implicated include increased levels of
fibrinogen,35,36 platelet activation,37,38 and catecholamines.39
More recently, inflammatory markers such as C-reactive
protein have been suggested.40,41 The association between
depression and the risk of stroke may also be attributed to
poor adherence to prescribed medical regimens, including
medication, diet, and exercise. Depression has been found to
be associated with low physical activity, smoking, and
indulging in behavioral patterns that may increase vascular
risk.22
The strengths of our investigation include its prospective
design, duration of follow-up, large community-based sam-
ple, home/nursing home evaluations, and intensive stroke
surveillance. Limitations include the lack of inclusion of
diverse racial/ethnic groups and psychiatric documentation of
depression and other mood disorders.
In conclusion, our study provides evidence supporting an
association between depressive symptoms and an increased
risk of stroke/TIA in individuals below the age of 65 years.
Research is needed to determine the pathophysiological
mechanisms leading to stroke in younger individuals who
report depressive symptoms. Increased awareness of stroke
risk in those exhibiting depressive symptoms may identify
those who could benefit from primary stroke prevention.
