Objective: To determine the relationship between in-
creasing depressive symptoms and cardiovascular events
or mortality.
Design: Cohort analytic study of data from randomized
placebo-controlleddouble-blind clinical trial ofantihyper-
tensive therapy. Depressive symptoms were assessed semi-
annually with the Center for Epidemiological Studies\p=m-\
Depression (CES-D) scale during an average follow-up of
4.5 years.
Setting: Ambulatory patients in 16 clinical centers of
the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program.
Patients: Generally healthy men and women aged 60
years or older randomized to active antihypertensive drug
therapy or placebo who were 79% white and 53% women
and had follow-up CES-D scores and no outcome events
during the first 6 months (N=4367).
Main Outcome Measures: All-cause mortality, fatal
or nonfatal stroke, or myocardial infarction.
Results: Baseline depressive symptoms were not re-
lated to subsequent events; however, an increase in de-
pression was prognostic. Cox proportional hazards
regression analyses with the CES-D scale as a time\x=req-\
dependent variable, controlling for multiple covariates,
indicated a 25% increased risk of death per 5-unit
increase in the CES-D score (relative risk [RR], 1.25; 95%
confidence interval [CI],
1.15 to 1.36). The RR for stroke
or myocardial infarction was 1.18 (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.30).
Increase in CES-D score was an independent predictor
in both placebo and active drug groups, and it was stron-
gest as a risk factor for stroke among women (RR, 1.29;
95% CI, 1.07 to 1.34).
Conclusions: Among elderly persons, a significant and
substantial excess risk of death and stroke or myocar-
dial infarction was associated with an increase in depres-
sive symptoms over time, which may be a marker for sub-
sequent major disease events and warrants the attention
of physicians to such mood changes. However, further
studies of causal pathways are needed before wide-
spread screening for depression in clinical practice is to
be recommended.

STUDIES
OF the relationship
of antecedent depression to
cardiovascular disease or
mortality have not reported
consistent results. Some
studies on patients with major clinical
depression have reported increased
mortality.1,2 However, a question with
broader medical and public health
implications concerns the effect of
depressive symptoms or depressed
mood that does not in itself merit a
clinical diagnosis of depression. It has
been estimated that 11% and 19% of
elderly community-dwelling men and
women, respectively, score above the
cutoff point for being at high risk of
clinical depression on the commonly
used self-report Center for Epidemio-
logical Studies-Depression (CES-D)
scale.3 Other studies on elderly people
have reported similar or higher
proportions.4"6 The prospective studies
on this issue have provided contradic¬
tory findings. Several studies have
found a positive relationship between
depression and subsequent cardiovascu¬
lar events.1,2'79; others have not.10 Some
of these studies have used only one
measurement of depressive symptoms
as
a predictor. A recent study by
Thomas et al10 on community-dwelling
elderly people measured depression
twice (2 years apart) using the CES-D
scale, which defined persons with tran¬
sient depression as those scoring above
the cutoff point of 16 on only one occa¬
sion, and which defined persons with

METHODS
ENROLLMENT
The SHEP was a randomized placebo-controlled clinical
trial of treatment of isolated systolic hypertension con¬
ducted in 16 clinical centers across the United States.
The SHEP design has been described in detail else¬
where." In summary, 4736 men and women aged 60
years or older with isolated systolic hypertension were
randomized to receive active treatment with low-dose
antihypertensive drugs or matching placebo. A stepped-
care approach was used starting with chlorthalidone at
12.5 mg/d, and adding atenolol at 25 mg/d if necessary,
to achieve the goal BP that was a systolic BP of less than
160 mm Hg or 20 mm Hg less than the entry level sys¬
tolic BP, whichever was lower. To be eligible for ran¬
domization, participants had to have a baseline systolic
BP of 160 mm Hg or more and less than 220 mm Hg,
and a diastolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg. Blood pressure
eligibility for randomization was determined by using
the average of four seated BP measurements, two at each
of two baseline visits. Persons receiving antihypertensive
medication at the initial screening contact were with¬
drawn from their antihypertensive medication with
informed consent and approval of their personal physi¬
cians, and if they met eligibility criteria within 8 weeks
of not receiving medication, they were randomized into
the trial. Exclusion criteria included the presence of
major cardiovascular disease or other major disease con¬
ditions such as cancer, alcoholic liver disease, renal dys¬
function, or the presence of medical management prob¬
lems. All participants had quarterly visits at which BP,
heart rate, body weight, medical history, and review of
medication use were obtained, and annual visits at
which a more detailed medical history, complete physi¬
cal examination, and laboratory tests were performed.
Questionnaires for depression and dementia were
administered semiannually.
ASSESSMENT OF DEPRESSION
Depressive symptoms were assessed with two screening
scales: the Short-Care Depressive Symptoms Scale14 and the
CES-D scale.15 The Short-Care Depressive Symptoms Scale
was in the form of a semistructured interview in which
trained raters assessed a variety of symptoms. If partici¬
pants reached the prespecified cutoffpoint of seven or more
points on the Short-Care Depressive Symptoms Scale, the
scale was administered again at the next quarterly visit and
if the patient reached the cutoff point at any two consecu¬
tive quarterly visits, he or she was referred to a psycholo¬
gist or psychiatrist for clinical evaluation of depression. The
correlation coefficient between these two scales was .67 at
baseline and .76 at 5 years.
The CES-D scale is widely used and consists of 20 ques¬
tions in which respondents are asked how often they have
experienced certain feelings or symptoms during the past
week. They may respond on a four-point scale from rarely
(0) to almost always (3). The reliability of the CES-D scale
ranges from 0.77 to 0.92 for various measures of reliabil¬
ity and for different populations.15 Persons with scores of
16 or more on the CES-D scale were considered "possibly
depressed." This cutoff point of 16 or more on the CES-D
scale is widely used as a screening tool,3'61015 indicating that
depressive symptoms have reached a level where clinical
diagnosis of depression is more likely. The complete scale
is given in Table I. The results presented herein are based
on the CES-D scale.
END-POINT DEFINITIONS
The end points considered herein are (1) deaths from all
causes, (2) fatal and nonfatal strokes, and (3) fatal and
nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). Nonfatal stroke was
defined as the rapid onset of new neurologic deficit
attributed to obstruction or rupture in the arterial sys¬
tem and persisting for at least 24 hours unless death
supervened. Nonfatal stroke was confirmed by the neu¬
rologic findings from examination or brain scan. Fatal
persistent depression as those scoring above the cutoff
point on both measurement occasions. It was found
that baseline, transient, or persistent depression did
not predict mortality. However, the subsequent obser¬
vation period was only 12 months; although there
were 1855 participants, there may not have been suffi¬
cient power to detect meaningful effects in that short
period. The question of emerging depressive symptoms
over time in relation to the risk of cardiovascular or
mortal events has not been addressed in population-
based studies until now.
We report herein on findings from the Systolic
Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP), on the
relationship between changes in depressive symptoms
over time and cardiovascular events among elderly
men and women aged 60 years or older. The SHEP
was a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind
clinical trial of antihypertensive therapy in partici¬
pants who were followed up for 5 years and had
depression scales administered every 6 months."
The objectives of SHEP were to determine if anti-
hypertensive treatment would reduce total strokes in
men and women aged 60 years or older with isolated
systolic hypertension (defined as a systolic blood pres¬
sure [BP] of >160 mm Hg and a diastolic BP of <90
mm Hg). The positive findings in the treated group
have broad implications for public health in that
stroke incidence was reduced by 36%, coronary heart
disease by 27%, and total cardiovascular disease by
31%.12 The benefit of treatment was apparent in all age
groups including those older than 80 years. To deter¬
mine if active treatment or placebo was associated
with any adverse effects with respect to depression or
dementia, an extensive behavioral battery was incor¬
porated into the study design. The SHEP found no dif¬
ference in incidence of dementia or depression
between the treated and placebo groups.1213 The ques¬
tion our report addresses is whether depression and
change in depressive symptoms are prospectively asso¬
ciated with risk of cardiovascular or mortal events in
the total SHEP cohort as well as in the placebo and
treatment groups separately.

stroke was established from death certificates or autopsy
reports and included preterminal hospitalization data. Sud¬
den cardiac death was defined as a death witnessed within
1 hour after the onset of severe cardiac symptoms or within
1 hour after the subject was last seen without symptoms
and no known nonatherosclerotic or other event that could
explain the sudden death and no documentation of acute
MI in the 4 weeks before death. A nonfatal MI was defined
as typical symptoms of acute MI plus either typical elec-
trocardiographic changes or significant enzyme level el¬
evations, but not including silent MI. Fatal MI was estab¬
lished at autopsy or on death certificate, also using
preterminal hospitalization data. Occurrence ofnonfatal and
fatal events was confirmed by a panel of three physicians
blinded to randomization status and included two neu¬
rologists for neurologic events and one cardiologist for car¬
diac events.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Cox proportional hazards regression analyses that
account for both time-constant and time-dependent
covariates were used to examine the relationship
between change in CES-D score over time and the
selected outcomes. Time-constant covariates are baseline
variables that do not change over time, such as sex or
race; time-dependent variables are those, like depression
scores, that may change during the course of the trial.
This type of life-table analysis controls for unequal peri¬
ods of observation for different individuals, permits sta¬
tistical adjustment for baseline covariates, and accounts
for changes in depression scores over the time of the
trial.
Baseline variables included in the model were age, race,
sex, years of education, and histories of Ml, stroke, and dia¬
betes, and current smoking status. Time-dependent vari¬
ables (measured at 6 months and every 6 months thereaf¬
ter) were change in depression score from baseline and
change in activities of daily living (ADL) scale,16 which is
an index of disability administered annually. An interac-
tion term between change in depression score and sex was
also entered to determine if the risk of events associated
with a change in depressive symptoms differed for men and
women. For analyses of the end-point death, the occur¬
rence of stroke or MI was entered as a time-dependent vari¬
able to control for possible depression after MI or stroke.
Although the change scores were approximately normally
distributed, we also used log-transformed scores in the analy¬
ses. Applicability of the proportional hazards regression
model was tested and met by plotting log(
—log[S(t)l ) as a
function oflog(t) where S(t) is the survival function.17 Rela¬
tive risks derived from the Cox regression analyses are pre¬
sented per 5-unit increase in the CES-D score. The within-
person SD on the CES-D scale in our cohort was 3.4. Thus,
a five-point increase in the CES-D score for an individual
represents an increase of approximately 1.5 SDs above his
or her mean. A five-point increase has been used in other
studies as an indication of change.10
PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSES
Participants in the SHEP who had not had one of the speci¬
fied outcomes by 6 months and who had valid baseline val¬
ues for depression scores were included in analyses per¬
taining to baseline predictors of events after the first 6
months (n=4508). Thus, of the 4736 participants random¬
ized to SHEP, 228 were excluded for these analyses. The
reasons for these 228 exclusions were as follows: 121 had
missing baseline CES-D scores, 33 had fatal or nonfatal
stroke, 18 had fatal or nonfatal MI, 39 had a new cancer
diagnosis, and 17 died of causes other than stroke or MI
before 6 months. Of the remaining 4508 participants, 141
had only a baseline depression score and no subsequent
CES-D scores against which to measure change and they
were excluded from analyses involving change in depres¬
sion, leaving 4367 persons available for Cox regression
analyses that were concerned with depression as a time-
dependent variable. If a depression score was missing at a
subsequent visit, the most recent available depression score
was substituted.
RESULTS
BASELINE CHARACTERISTIC OF COHORT
The mean age of the participants was 72 years and 13.1%
were 80 years or older. Black men composed 4.6% of the
group; black women, 9.3%; white men, 35.2%; and white
women, 43.9%. At the initial contact, 33% of the partici¬
pants were receiving antihypertensive medication; 61%
had baseline electrocardiographic abnormalities. The
mean baseline systolic and diastolic BPs were 170 mm Hg
and 77 mm Hg, respectively. These variables were simi¬
lar to the whole cohort of 4736 participants,12 and the
actively treated group and placebo group were similar in
all baseline characteristics examined.
BASELINE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS
Table 2 shows depression scale scores at baseline. The
mean CES-D score for the total group was 4.15, which
is lower than that from other samples of the elderly popu-
lation, such as the Yale Health and Aging Project, where
the average score for white persons was about 8.1.3
Women had significantly higher depression scores than
men. There was significant variation by race and ethnic¬
ity, with black and Hispanic participants having higher
CES-D scores than whites and with Asians having the low¬
est mean score. There was a small but significant rise in
mean depression scores with age, but the average base¬
line depression scores were still low even among those
older than 80 years (mean score, 5.16). Women scored
significantly higher within each age group with a P value
less than .01 (data not shown).
The overall baseline prevalence of depression (de¬
fined as a CES-D score ^16) was 4.8% for the entire co¬
hort, and about twice as high for women as for men (6.2%
vs 2.8%, PS.001). A substantially higher proportion of
blacks and Hispanics (8.9% and 9.8%, respectively) scored
above the cutoff point than did whites (4.0%) or Asians
(3.6%). Within each race and ethnic group, a higher pro¬
portion of women than men scored above the cutoffpoint,
in particular among the black participants, where the pro-

portion of women scoring as possibly depressed was about
three times higher than that for black men (11.7% vs
3.4%).
INCIDENCE OF DEPRESSION
Table 3 shows the percent of the cohort who at base¬
line had a CES-D score below the cutoff point of 16, but
who at some time during the trial scored 16 or more. The
overall 5-year incidence of depression in this cohort was
similar in the actively treated and placebo groups (12.4%
and 12.5%, respectively, over 5 years).
Women (14.9%), however, had a significantly higher
incidence ofbecoming depressed than men (9.3%; PS.001
for both women and men). The rates of clinically diag¬
nosed depression were approximately one third the rates
of depression as defined on the CES-D scale (3.5% for
women and about 5.5% for men), with no differences be¬
tween drug and placebo groups either in men or women.
INCIDENCE OF EVENTS BY DEPRESSED
STATUS AT BASELINE
Baseline depression (CES-D score, >16) did not predict
the occurrence of subsequent stroke, MI, or death from
any cause over the next 5 years, with approximately the
same proportions of the depressed (20.9%) and not de¬
pressed (18.0%) developing any of these events (P=.27;
Table 4). This finding was the same in a Cox propor¬
tional hazards analysis after controlling for all the base¬
line covariates.

COX REGRESSION ANALYSES
Since this was a prospective study and since depression
scores change over time, we performed Cox proportional
hazards analyses controlling for covariates and with change
in depression as a time-dependent covariate. In addition,
because depressive symptoms may be related to disabil¬
ity that in turn may be related to an impending event, cor¬
relation coefficients were determined between ADL scale
and the CES-D scale. The correlation coefficients, though
significantly different from zero, were quite low and ranged
from —.11 at baseline to —.20 among the survivors at 5
years that accounted for no more than 1% to 4% of the
variance in the CES-D score. The negative correlation co¬
efficient indicates increased depression scores with de¬
creasing ADL scores, though it does not indicate whether
loss of function with aging or illness leads to, depression
or vice versa. However, since there was an increase in the
correlation coefficients over time, the ADL scale was in¬
cluded as a time-dependent covariate in multivariate analy¬
ses. Baseline ADL scale scores alone would not be able to

account for possible effects of deterioration of functions
with aging. The primary variable of interest was change
in depressive symptoms on the CES-D scale as a time-
dependent covariate, while controlling for baseline de¬
pression, age, sex, race, randomization group, years of edu¬
cation, history ofstroke, MI, or diabetes, smoking, baseline
ADL, and ADL as a time-dependent covariate.
Table 5 shows the relative risk of events associ¬
ated with a 5-unit increase on the CES-D scale. There was
a 25% increase in risk of death per each 5-unit increase
in depression on the CES-D scale (relative risk, 1.25; 95%
confidence interval, 1.15 to 1.36; P<.001). In the regres¬
sion model for death, the occurrence of a stroke or MI
was entered as an additional covariate to control for the
possible confounding effect of increased depression af¬
ter such nonfatal events. The significantly increased risk
of death with increase in depressive symptoms held true
for women as well as men and in the treated group as
well as in the placebo group.

There was a similar increase in risk of either stroke
or MI, controlling for sex and the other covariates (rela¬
tive risk, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.30;
P<.001). The likelihood ratio test comparing the model
that included change in the CES-D score to the reduced
model without the time-dependent variable of change in
depressive symptoms indicated a significant, indepen¬
dent effect of increase in depression as a risk factor
(P=.001). When men and women were analyzed sepa¬
rately, there was an excess risk of 26% per 5-unit change
in CES-D score among women (PS.001) and a nonsig-
nificantly elevated risk in men.
Models considering the end points of stroke and MI
separately indicate that the risk of stroke controlling for
MI was significantly associated with an increase in de¬
pression, particularly among women, and risk of MI (con¬
trolling for prior occurrence of stroke) was also in¬
creased, but not significantly.
COMMENT
In a large prospective follow-up study of men and women
older than 60 years with isolated systolic hypertension,
our findings from SHEP show that an increase in depres¬
sive symptoms is associated with increased risk of death
and stroke, particularly among women. These findings
pertain to persons who exhibit changes in depression on
the commonly used CES-D scale, and who are commu¬
nity-dwelling persons rather than patients diagnosed as
having clinical depression that meets psychiatric crite¬
ria. Other than having isolated systolic hypertension, the
patients at the start of SHEP were generally a healthy group
of individuals, both physically and psychologically. Thus,
the implications of these findings relate to a potentially
large group of persons.
The SHEP cohort at the inception of the study showed
a low level of depressive symptoms, even at older ages.
Women, blacks, Hispanics, and the less educated re¬
ported more depressive symptoms at baseline than other
sociodemographic groups. We found that after control¬
ling for multiple covariates that included a time-
dependent measure of disability, an increase of five points
on the CES-D scale was associated with a 25% increase in
risk of death and an 18% increase in risk of stroke for the
cohort of individuals who were free of events during the
first 6 months after baseline. An increase of 5 units rep-

resents approximately 1.5 SDs above the patient's mean.
About 37% of the patients had an increase of 5 units or
more from baseline at some time during the trial and be¬
fore any event, after excluding all patients who had a di¬
agnosis of cancer during the trial. Approximately 9% had
an increase of five points or more on the CES-D scale dur¬
ing the first 6 months.
The incidence ofpossible depression during the trial,
defined as exceeding a cutoff-point level of 16 or more on
the CES-D scale among thosewho scoredbelow the cutoff
point at baseline was 12.4%, and there was no difference
between the treated and placebo groups. A comparable in¬
cidence rate (11.2%) was found in a study of 1457 elderly
community-dwelling residents.18 However, similar to the
findings on baseline prevalence, the incidence was consid¬
erably higher in women than in men. Other studies have
also found a higher prevalence or incidence of depression
among women35'619 and amongblacks,5-19 as well as among
the less educated.520,21 The low prevalence and incidence
of depression that we found among Asians is intriguing.
Patients with affective disorder have been reported to
have a higher-than-expected rate ofmortality from cardio¬
vascular disease.2 Depression, assessed through a variety
ofinstruments, was associatedwithmortality in several stud¬
ies22,23 but not in others.10,24"26 In one of the first prospec¬
tive psychiatric studies by Crisp et al27 of the mental pre¬
cursors to MI, male patients who in the future developed
coronary heart disease were found to be significantly more
depressed than the other male subjects. Ina prospective study
byAppels and Mulder28,29 of3877 male civil servants in the
Rotterdam Civil Servants Study, it was found that only se¬
lected elements ofdepression were found before MI. Two
major elements ofdepression, negative self-concept and feel¬
ings ofguilt, were not found to be predictive in the Rotter¬
dam Civil Servants Study. The other depressive symptoms
(a sad, apathetic mood, loss of sleep and sexual desire, fa¬
tigue, and tiredness) were called "vital exhaustion." Appels
and Mulder suggest that vital exhaustion is not necessar¬
ily a cause of coronary heart disease but may promote its
progression in persons already prone to it.
The study by Thomas and colleagues10 ofelderly per¬
sons with an average age of about 75 years reported that
respondents with either incident depression over 2 years
of follow-up or persistent symptoms of depression (ie,
scoring above the CES-D scale cutoff point of 16 both at
baseline and at 2 years) were not more likely to die in the
following year, nor did baseline depression predict mor¬
tality, while poor or declining health was a predictor. In
our study, ADL as an indication of disability was not pre¬
dictive ofmortality, whereas an increase in depression was
predictive. The study by Thomas et al was smaller (1855
participants compared with 4367 in our study), had a
shorter follow-up (1 year compared with 5 years in SHEP),
and did not look at depression as a time-dependent co¬
variate. These factors may account for the discrepancy.
The Yale Health and Aging Project24 (a study of 2604
stroke-free men and women in New Haven, Conn, with a
mean age of74 years andwith 7 years offollow-up) found
that while the CES-D scale predicted stroke in a univari-
ate Cox proportional hazards model, it had no effect after
controlling for age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and
physical function. In contrast, we found that there was an
18% increase in risk of stroke overall and a 29% increase
among women for a 5-unit increase on the CES-D scale,
after controlling for multiple covariates that included
changes in disability levels over time. All of our partici¬
pants had isolated systolic hypertension, and the in¬
crease in risk with increasing depression was significant
in both the treated and placebo groups. The data pre¬
sented herein do not prove a causal pathway leading from
depression to cardiovascular events. It is possible that the
development of premonitory signs and symptoms of car¬
diovascular events, eg, increasing angina or dyspnea, could
have led to increased depressive scores.

thetic activity in patients with depression,29,37 and angi-
ography has shown that there is a correlation between de¬
pression and vessel obstruction.38 A link between depression
and sudden death has been postulated to operate through
the interaction of the catecholamine-corticoid sys¬
tems.7,39,40 An acute catecholamine surge is associated with
arrhythmia during the first hours following an MI.41 Also,
the serotonergic system, which is important in depres¬
sion, may be implicated in arrhythmia.42
Links can also be made between life circumstances
and the evidence that lipid and sympathetic systems are
more active under situations of stress.1,39 It has been found
that especially patients dying of MI experienced one or
more periods of distress, exhaustion, or depression in their
lives. In the Rotterdam Civil Servants Study,28,29 it was
found that memories of earlier periods of mental and
physical exhaustion are reactivated before Ml. Many pa¬
tients with coronary artery disease stated that their men¬
tal state before their MI was similar to an earlier time in
which they had been "overwrought."9
An increase in depressive symptoms preceding stroke,
MI, or death may be a marker for an impending event. In
the analyses presented herein, we did not relate change in
depression to change in premonitory signs and symptoms
of cardiovascular disease events, such as unstable angina
or transient ischémie attacks. If an increase in depression
occurred subsequent to the appearance of premonitory
symptoms but antecedent to the event, it would suggest
that the premonitory symptoms caused the depression. In
such a case, the increase in depression could be an alert
that some acute morbid event may be on its way. On the
other hand, if the increase in depression occurred ante¬
cedent to the appearance of premonitory symptoms that
in turn were antecedent to the event, then the depression
might be a causal factor. In our study, we cannot ascertain
what causal pathways may be operating. Subtle presenta¬
tions ofimpending acute events related to chronic disease
may cause depression. Conversely, depression may cause
subtle perturbations in neurohumoral function that serve
as the "straw that breaks the camel's back" in terms ofhelp¬
ing precipitate an acute event in a patient with a chronic
disease. There are three possibilities for the observed as¬
sociation between an increase in depression scores and
stroke, MI, and total mortality: (1) the increase in depres¬
sive symptoms is the cause of the subsequent stroke, MI,
or death; (2) the impending stroke, MI, or underlying cause
of death causes the increase in depressive symptoms; and
(3) some other factor or process causes both the depres¬
sive symptoms and the occurrence ofstroke, MI, or death.
Increasingly, primary care physicians will be the gate¬
keepers of health care services for all patients and for the
growing number ofolder patients. The Agency for Health
Care Policy and Research at the US Department of Health
and Human Services has published clinical practice guide¬
lines for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of depres¬
sion in primary care43,44 and is beginning to evaluate the
extent to which these guidelines are followed. However,
these guidelines mostly pertain to major mood disorder
and not to the much more common and milder aspects of
depressive symptoms that are the focus of our study. Our

findings emphasize that physicians should recognize signs
ofincreasing depression in elderly patients and suggest that
standardized assessments ofdepressive symptoms in clini¬
cal practice may be useful as a nonspecific, but perhaps
sensitive, premonitory warning of the possible occur¬
rence of an acute morbid event on top of a silent (or stable)
chronic disease. In particular, women's self-reported symp¬
toms of changes in mood or affect may be too readily dis¬
missed as not clinically significant, though such changes
are associated with increased risk of untoward events that
perhaps could be prevented by appropriate and timely in¬
tervention. Nevertheless, a limitation of our study is that
it addresses a post hoc hypothesis and needs to be repli¬
cated before such widespread screening ofdepressive symp¬
toms is adopted in clinical practice.
In summary, among elderly persons with isolated
systolic hypertension, we found a significant and sub¬
stantial excess risk of death, stroke, or MI associated with
an increase in symptoms of depression over time after
controlling for multiple covariates. Studies are needed
to establish if there is a causal relationship, to elucidate
mechanisms that link depression to stroke or death, and
to determine if intervening in possible depression may
decrease the risk of these events.
