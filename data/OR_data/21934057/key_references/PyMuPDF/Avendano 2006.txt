Background and Purpose—This study assesses the effect of socioeconomic status on stroke incidence in the elderly, and
the contribution of risk factors to stroke disparities.
Methods—Data comprised a sample of 2812 men and women aged 65 years and over from the New Haven cohort of the
Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. Individuals provided baseline information on
demographics, functioning, cardiovascular and psychosocial risk factors in 1982 and were followed for 12 years.
Proportional hazard models were used to model survival from initial interview to first fatal or nonfatal stroke.
Results—Two hundred and seventy subjects developed incident stroke. At ages 65 to 74, lower socioeconomic status was
associated with higher stroke incidence for both education (HRlowest/highest2.07, 95% CI, 1.04 to 4.13) and income
(HRlowest/highest2.08, 95% CI, 1.01 to 4.27). Adjustment for race, diabetes, depression, social networks and functioning
attenuated hazard ratios to a nonsignificant level, whereas other risk factors did not change associations significantly.
Beyond age 75, however, stroke rates were higher among those with the highest education (HRlowest/highest0.42, 95% CI,
0.22 to 0.79) and income (HRlowest/highest0.43, 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.86), which remained largely unchanged after adjustment
for risk factors.
Conclusions—We observed substantial socioeconomic disparities in stroke at ages 65 to 74, whereas a crossover of
the association occurred beyond age 75. Policies to improve social and economic resources at early old age, and
interventions to improve diabetes management, depression, social networks and functioning in the disadvantaged elderly
can contribute to reduce stroke disparities. (Stroke. 2006;37:1368-1373.)

D
isparities in cardiovascular health are a major public
health problem. Eliminating these disparities is one of
the major goals of the Healthy people 2010 public agenda,
which calls for further research to understand the causes of
these disparities.1 Lower socioeconomic status is associated
with higher stroke incidence in European countries.2–6 How-
ever, little research has examined this association in the US
and how it varies across age-groups. It is also not well
established which risk factors mediate this association. Pre-
vious research in the UK suggests that conventional risk
factors such as hypertension and smoking explain about half
of these disparities.3 However, these studies were focused on
those aged 65.3 Around 89% of strokes occur after age 65,7
whereby factors such as depression and functioning are also
major risk factors for stroke.8,9
We assessed the effect of socioeconomic status on stroke
incidence in the US elderly, and the role of risk factors in
explaining stroke disparities. Furthermore, we examined the
role of race. We used data from a representative sample of the
elderly in New Haven followed for 12 years. As relative
disparities decrease or disappear at old age,10,11 we assessed
whether this age-pattern applies to stroke. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to assess the contribution of biomedical,
psychosocial and functioning risk factors to stroke disparities
in the elderly, and how this pattern varies for the old and
oldest old.

study, a prospective investigation aimed at identifying predictors of
mortality and disability in the elderly. Details of this study have been
described elsewhere.12 The sample was stratified by type of resi-
dence: (1) public elderly housing, (2) private elderly housing and (3)
general community housing. Because of the preponderance of
women, men were oversampled in community and private housing.12
The response rate was 82%, yielding a baseline sample of 2812
participants. Respondents with a history of stroke at baseline
(n208) or missing basic demographics were excluded. Education
data were missing for 73 individuals (2.8%) and income data for 347
participants (13.4%). The final sample comprised 2524 individuals
for education and 2250 individuals for income.
Data Collection and Measurements
Interviews were conducted in 1982 by trained interviewers and in-
cluded information on:
Socioeconomic Status and Demographics
Education and income were used as indicators of socioeconomic
status. Education was measured as years of schooling completed (0
to 7, 8 to 9, 10 to 12, or 13), and income as household income in
the year before baseline (0 to 4999, 5000 to 9999, 10 000 to 14 999,
or 15 000 US dollars). Race was classified into white non-
Hispanic, black non-Hispanic and other. Age was based on self-
report and used as a continuous variable.
Conventional Risk Factors
(1) Blood pressure was measured according to the Hypertension
Detection and Follow-up Program protocol.13 A hypertension diag-
nosis was based on blood pressure measurements or use of hyper-
tension medication. Categories comprised normotensive, controlled,
isolated systolic, and diastolic (with or without systolic) hyperten-
sion. (2) Smoking was classified into never smoked, exsmoker, and
currently smoking daily 14, 15 to 24, and 25 cigarettes. (3)
Diabetes mellitus was ascertained through self-report at baseline. (4)
Body mass index was based on self-reported weight and height
(weight [kg]/height [m2]). (5) Physical activity was measured by
self-reported walks, garden work and active sports (scale: often,
sometimes and never), and defined as number of items with response
category ‘often’.14 (6) Alcohol consumption was based on self-
reported use in the preceding month and categorized into: nondrink-
ers, moderate (0.1 to 20 ounces/month) or heavy (21 ounces/
month) drinkers.
Physical/Cognitive Functioning
Three complementary measures of physical functioning were used:
(1) A modified version of the Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale15
assessed the ability to perform basic activities without assistance
(none versus 1 limitations). (2) The Rosow-Breslau Functional
Health Scale16 assessed the number of limitations in activities of
gross mobility. (3) The Nagi Scale measured the number of limita-
tions in physical performance activities (eg, difficulty in stooping,
crouching and kneeling).17
Cognitive function was measured using a 10-item version of the
SPMSQ (Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire)18 and scored
by the number of errors (1, 2 to 3, and 4).19
Psychosocial Risk Factors
(1) Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.20 A score of 21 or more
indicates depressive symptomatology in the elderly.21 (2) The Social
Networks Index measured social ties with children, relatives, friends
and a confidant, and social participation.22 (3) Stressful life events
were the summed score of 8 items on stressful events (eg, death of
a close relative) during the past year (none, 1, 2, or 3).23
Stroke Outcomes
An incident event was defined as first nonfatal or fatal stroke.
Nonfatal strokes were ascertained through yearly interviews from
1983 through 1990/1991, and in 1994. Education/income informa-
tion was ascertained at baseline only. Independently, participants
were asked in subsequent waves whether they had been diagnosed
with stroke since last interviewed. Only 99 survivors (3.9%) did not
have complete interviews until 1994, and were censored at last
interview date.
Fatal strokes were ascertained through daily review of obituaries,
hospital admission records and annual interviews with participant or
next of kin. Records were matched to the National Death Index and
death certificates obtained. Data on mortality and cause of death
were successfully obtained for almost all participants (99%).
Methods of Analysis
As results did not differ by sex, men and women were combined to
obtain more precise estimates. Firstly, standardized stroke rates were
calculated by education and income, using the entire population as
the standard. Cox proportional hazard models were then used to
quantify the impact of socioeconomic indicators on stroke. Survival
was defined as time from baseline to date of first fatal or nonfatal
stroke, death from other causes, or last interview. Initial models were
adjusted for age, sex and race. Subsequently, conventional, function-
ing and psychosocial factors were added. Psychosocial factors and
functioning measures were correlated. However, correlations were
generally modest, so that there was no collinearity in the models.
Final models were adjusted for all factors. HRs (hazard ratios) for the
reference model (adjusted for age, sex and race) were compared with
HRs additionally adjusted for risk factors, using the following
formula: (100[HRreferenceHRadjusted]/[HRreference1]). Analyses were
weighted using SUDAAN (version 9.01). Weights permitted the
sample characteristics to be inflated to the total New Haven older
population, thus assuring the validity of generalizations. We applied
housing unit weights, weights to account for male oversampling, and
poststratification weights.12
Results
During 20 315 person-years, 270 subjects developed incident
stroke. Among individuals aged 65 to 74 years, lower
socioeconomic status was associated with a higher stroke
incidence (Table 1). The standardized stroke incidence rates
in those with low education or income were twice as high
than in those with high education (HR2.07, 95% CI, 1.04 to
4.13) or income (HR2.08, 95% CI, 1.01 to 4.27). A reverse
pattern occurred at ages 75 and over, so that stroke incidence
rates were higher in the highest education (HR0.42, 95%
CI, 0.22 to 0.79) and income (HR0.43, 95% CI, 0.22 to
0.86) groups (Table 1).
Adjustment for race attenuated hazard ratios between the
highest and lowest socioeconomic groups by about one third
(Tables 2 and 3), and confidence intervals became wide and
overlapped with the null value. HRs remained largely un-
changed after adjustment for hypertension, smoking and
alcohol consumption, and adjustment for physical activity
and BMI slightly decreased HRs for education but not for
income. HRs for both education and income were attenuated
after adjustment for diabetes. Accordingly, although most
risk factors predicted stroke incidence, only diabetes was
clearly associated with socioeconomic status (supplemental
Table I, available online at http://stroke.ahajournals.org).
Adjustment for all conventional risk factors attenuated the
effect of education by 22% and income by 43%, which was
almost entirely attributable to diabetes.
Adjustment for depressive symptoms and social networks
attenuated HRs considerably for both education and income,
whereas life events did not change HRs. Altogether, psycho-

social factors reduced HRs by about 50%. This reflected the
consistent association of depression and social networks with
education, income and stroke (supplemental Table I). Adjust-
ment for physical and cognitive functioning reduced HRs by
about one quarter (Tables 2 and 3). After adjusting for all
factors, HRs were no longer significant and decreased by
about 60% for education and almost 90% for income.
At ages 75 and over, major risk factors such as hyperten-
sion and BMI did not consistently predict stroke (supplemen-
tal Table I). Thus, entering risk factors did not change HRs
for education or income, which remained well below 1 after
adjustment (Table 4).
Discussion
At ages 65 to 74 years, lower education and income were
associated with higher stroke incidence. Adjustment for race,
diabetes, depressive symptomatology, social networks, and
cognitive/physical functioning reduced these associations
considerably, whereas other conventional risk factors did not
alter associations. Beyond age 75, higher socioeconomic
status was associated with higher stroke rates, even after
adjustment for risk factors. This suggests a crossover of the
association beyond age 75.
Study Limitations
A strength of our study was the long and virtually complete
follow-up. However, some limitations should be consid-
ered. Mortality was accurately ascertained throughout
follow-up. However, nonfatal strokes were ascertained
through yearly interviews, which may have resulted in
underestimation of stroke incidence. Nevertheless, we
found no evidence that underestimation occurred differen-
tially by socioeconomic status. Furthermore, a data audit in
the period 1982 to 1988 showed high correspondence
between cases detected through interview and hospital
records inspection.24 Thus, any bias caused by this prob-
lem is likely to be small.
A majority of the EPESE cohort was retired, with some
participants living in elderly housing. Thus, although we
asked participants to report income from all household
sources, income may not fully reflect all resources available
to participants. Thus, we do not know whether a different
pattern might be observed for factors such as wealth, which
reflect assets accumulation through life.25
Data on stroke subtypes were not available in our study.
However, previous research indicates that the effect of socio-
economic status is similar for both ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke.5,6 Nevertheless, future studies should assess whether
the role of risk factors in explaining stroke disparities may
vary by stroke subtype.
Comparison With Previous Studies
Previous research suggests that conventional risk factors such
as smoking explain about half of stroke disparities before age
65.3 However, we found that these factors play a less

predict stroke.8 These factors contributed to stroke disparities
in our study. Alternatively, their contribution may also reflect
a reverse effect of these factors (eg, physical functioning) on
income. However, reverse causality cannot explain results
for educational level, which is largely determined early in
life.2
Socioeconomic disparities in stroke at ages 65 to 74 partly
reflect the higher stroke rates among blacks than whites.26
Blacks have on average less education and income, and are
more likely to develop stroke than their white counterparts26
(supplemental Table I). This is partly explained by a higher
burden of risk factors among blacks, and may also reflect
genetic susceptibility.26 However, despite wide confidence
intervals, an elevated risk remained after adjustment or
stratification by race. Thus, despite large racial stroke dispar-
ities, the effect of socioeconomic status on stroke appears to
be independent from race.
Prior research reported that stroke disparities diminish but
remain beyond age 75.2 However, our study comprised a
longer follow-up and included both first fatal and nonfatal
strokes. Studies indicate that the effect of socioeconomic
status on all-cause mortality disappear or even reverses at
approximately age 75.11 Our findings suggest that this cross-
over10 might be even stronger for stroke.
Interpretation of Findings
Conventional risk factors such as smoking were strong
predictors of stroke at ages 65 to 74, but did not explain
stroke disparities. This may be attributable to their weak
association with socioeconomic status. Accordingly, in ear-
lier birth cohorts, the prevalence of risk factors did not vary
as much by socioeconomic status, and only in more recent
cohorts do disparities in risk factors such as smoking begin to
emerge.27 Their role in explaining stroke disparities may thus
be limited at ages 65 to 74, whereas they may play a more
important role in more recent birth cohorts.3
On the other hand, socioeconomic disparities in other risk
factors played a more important role. Diabetes disparities
may originate from differentials in obesity throughout life.28
Depression is associated with an increased risk of atheroscle-
rosis,29 through which it may contribute to stroke disparities.
Lower social networks are associated with higher functional
limitations,19 which might lead to less physical activity and
thus higher stroke rates. However, physical limitations may
also be a marker for other health problems, which might
mediate the association of socioeconomic status on stroke.
Beyond age 75, higher socioeconomic status was associ-
ated with higher stroke rates. Because of their weak associ-
ation with stroke and socioeconomic status, adjustment for
risk factors did not explain this crossover. Failure of educa-
tion and income to represent the true socioeconomic re-
sources of the oldest old may explain this pattern. Neverthe-
less, a similar race crossover has also been previously
reported, whereby black mortality rates can become lower
than white rates after approximately age 75.10 Selective
survival and competing causes of death may explain this
pattern. Individuals with lower socioeconomic status may die
earlier from other causes, so that only the healthiest survive
into old age. Simultaneously, better survival might lead to
postponement of death toward older ages among higher
socioeconomic groups.10,11 Thus, higher socioeconomic
groups might be more likely to live ‘long enough’ to develop
stroke at very old ages. Nevertheless, previous research
indicates that selective survival cannot fully account for age
variations in mortality differentials.11 Further studies should
attempt to replicate these findings and explore possible
explanations.
Implications
Social and economic circumstances of the elderly shape a
wide array of conditions such as stroke. Men and women
with a low socioeconomic status face a disproportionate share

of social and health disadvantage. Thus, policies aimed at
providing both economic and social resources may improve
their profile. This can be supplemented with interventions to
improve diabetes and depression management, and to main-
tain social networks and functioning in the lower socioeco-
nomic groups.19,24 As world populations age, the toll of social
and economic disadvantage is likely to increase, along with
the societal impact of stroke. Thus, it is incumbent on us to
develop effective interventions at middle and early old age,
and thus diminish the higher burden of stroke among disad-
vantaged populations.
