Morbidity and Mortality: A 15-Year
Follow-Up of Members of a Health
Maintenance Organization

Introduction
An extensive literature examines the
relationship of psychological distress to
mortality risk.'-" In presenting their own
negative data, Roberts et al.4 surmised
that reported associations of psychologi-
cal state to mortality are misleading be-
cause case-control and cross-sectional
studies have generally involved persons
who are psychologically impaired and
thus are not representative of the broader
population. Community studies, on the
other hand, have been less likely to make
such associations.4-'4 Animal studies
demonstrate clear relationships between
various stresses and immune response,
both in vitro and in vivo'5,'6; such effects,
if they persist over long periods, might be
expected to influence susceptibility to se-
lected morbidities. A meta-analysis of the
role of personality in disease causationl7
suggests the possible existence of a "dis-
ease-prone" personality that is character-
ized by anger/hostility and anxiety.
This paper examines the extent to
which four baseline measures of mental
and emotional health and well-being were
able to predict 15-year morbidity and mor-
tality in a random sample of adult enrollees
in a large health maintenance organization
(HMO). The four measures examined were
the Langner Mental Health Index, a de-
pression scale, the Bradbum-Caplowitz
Affect-Balance Scale, and the Bradbum
Worries Index. The relation of morbidity
and mortality in this group to social net-
works has been examined separately18

care organization in Portland, Ore, whose
membership is generally representative of
the Portland, Ore/Vancouver, Wash,
standard statistical metropolitan area.'9
Subjects were respondents to a 1970/71
personal interview survey. Of the house-
holds randomly selected, 92% (1529) were
successfully interviewed. Thirty individu-
als who left the health plan less than 6
months after the survey interview were
eliminated from the analyses. To be eligi-
ble, individuals had to have been enrolled
in the health plan prior to January 1, 1969,
thus permitting 2 years of retrospective
medical records review prior to the sur-
vey. Medical records for this population
were routinely abstracted from the date of
enrollment or January 1967, whichever
was earlier.
Independent Variables
The baseline measures were derived
from the 1970/71 personal interview sur-
vey. These measures include self-reported
general health status and scores on the
Langner Mental Health Index, a depres-
sion scale, the Bradbum-Caplowitz Af-
fect-Balance Scale, and the Bradburn
Worries Index.
The Langner index20 is a count of the
number of 22 symptoms (e.g., head-
aches, night sweats, heart pounding,
trouble sleeping, etc.) the respondent of-
ten experiences. It is scored from 0 to 22
(mean = 2.19, SD = 2.38). Although de-

signed as a general measure of mental
health, it is widely regarded as an index of
psychophysiological symptomatology
and general malaise.21
The depression index was created
from questions on the survey that allowed
a close approximation of the clinical def-
inition of depression in the American
Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and
Statisfical Manual, 3rd edition.22 The in-
strument and distributions of scores on its
component questions are discussed in Mc-
Farland et al.23
The Bradbum-Caplowitz Affect-Bal-
ance Scale24 was created from questions
asldng about five negative and five posi-
tive emotional states (e.g., during the past
few weeks, did you ever feel proud? lone-
ly?). To an initial score of 5, +1 is added
for each "yes" response to a positive
emotional state and -1 for each "yes"
response to a negative emotional state.
Scores range from 0 to 10, a higher score
indicating a positive affect (mean = 7.22,
SD = 1.79).
The Bradburn Worries Scaler5 con-
sists of 12 items (e.g., during the past few
weeks, have you been worried about
money? job? world?) weighted from not
worried (0) to very worried (2). Scores
range from 0 to 24 (mean = 3.48,
SD = 2.66). This index is intended to re-
flect transitory mental states (unlike the
Langner index, which purportedly mea-
sures more enduring states).
Dependent Vanables
Vital status as of the end of 1985 was
determined for all members of the study
population through searches of the na-
tional death index and vital records for
Oregon and Washington states.
Intemnational Classification of Dis-
eases, version 7 (ICD-7)26 codes were
used to classify all confirmed morbidities
for all years of the study. The use of a
single coding system prevented disconti-
nuities secondary to ICD code revisions.
The first incidence was determined
for the following morbid outcome groups
(ICD-7 codes): ischemic heart disease
(420, 421.5, 422.1), cancer (140-205, ex-
cluding 191), stroke (330-334, 335.1), hy-
pertension (447.0, 447.2), infection (002-
138), diseases of hyperimmunity (allergy
[240, 242-245], asthma [241], osteoarthri-
tis [723], autoimmune diseases [252.0,
254.0, 256, 271.1, 290.0, 296, 456, 704,
744]), and functional gastrointestinal dis-
eases (540-544, 571-573). Persons with a
past history of a morbid condition were
excluded from analyses of that condition
so that the outcomewas always defined as
the first incidence of a morbidity.
Analyses
Cox proportional hazards regression
models were used to assess the 15-year
relative hazards of mortality and morbid-
ity. These nonparametric models allow
the hazards ofdeath and disease incidence
to include follow-up time but require that
the proportional effects of predictors on
hazards be constant over the entire fol-
low-up interval. The Cox regression pro-
cedure allows censoring due to health plan
disenroilment and includes a goodness-
of-fit test of the proportional hazards as-
sumption. The exponential function of a
Cox regression coefficient is the relative
hazard ofthe outcome for a unit difference
in the predictor variable.
Analyses were adjusted for age, sex,
self-reported health status, self-reported
social class, cigarette smoking status, and
duration of health plan membership. For
most of the analyses, the predictor vari-
ables were divided into approximate ter-
tiles, with the upper (high) tertile serving
as the referent for comparisons with the
bottom (low) tertile. The SAS SUGI pro-
cedure PHGLMV was used.
Kaplan Meier and log-log hazard
plots and proportional hazard z scores
were used to verify Cox model assump-
tions. Stepwise inclusion criteria were
used to identify interactions of age, gen-
der, and baseline subjective health status
that significantly improved the predictive
power of the main effects models.
Results
Table 1 shows the characteristics of
the study population. The population is a
broadly distributed group of HMO mem-
bers generally representative of the met-
ropolitan area from which they were
drawn.
Table 2 presents the percentage of
individuals within each of five age groups
that fell into the approximate tertiles of
the various psychosocial measures. For
each measure, cut points were selected
that most nearly distributed the respon-
dents into thirds. Depression scores were
highest in those under 30, followed by
those over 75. Those from 30 to 74 years
of age were least likely to be depressed.
Persons under 30 were least likely to fall
in the lowest (most healthy) tertile on the
Langner scale and most likely to fall in
the highest tertile. Persons aged 60 to 74
were most likely to fall in the lowest
tertile. The worries index was inversely
related to age, with the two oldest age
groups (60 and above) showing the few-
est worries. Persons over age 75 were
most likely to fall in the lowest tertile of
affect balance (worst affect balance), and
those aged 30 to 44 had the highest affect-
balance.
Table 3 presents the Pearson corre-
lations among the four psychological
scales. Depression and the Langner index
were highly correlated (r = .83). The
other measures were significantly but
more weakly correlated.
Table 4 presents the 15-year relative
hazards (RHs) of mortality and morbidity
incidence. For each index, the lowest ter-
tile was compared with the highest tertile.
The table includes both unadjusted rates
and rates adjusted for age, sex, smoking
status, socioeconomic status (SES), self-
reported health status, and duration of
health plan membership.
Those in the low and medium tertiles
of the depression index at baseline (not
depressed) were at increased risk for sub-
sequent hypertension compared with
those scoring high on the depression in-
dex. Depression was also related to an
increased incidence of functional gastro-
intestinal disease and was marginally as-

sociated with an increased hazard for dis-
eases of hyperimmunity. The other five
dependent variables were not related to
depression. For men only (data not
shown), the risk of dying during the fol-
low-up interval was lower for the least de-
pressed compared with the most de-
pressed tertiles (RH = 0.71; confidence
interval [CI] = 0.52, 0.97). No other in-
teractions with sex were observed.
A high score on the L
er index
was related to an increased risk of both
functional gastrointestinal and hyperim-
mune diseases among all persons. The
index interacted with age in predicting in-
cidence of hypertension. Younger individ-
ualswith a low mental health score were at
icreasedriskforhypertension(RH = 1.47;
CI = 1.05, 2.04 at age 30), while older per-
sonswith a lowmental health scorewere at
reduced hazard (RH = 0.76; CI = 0.62,
0.92). No other main effects or interactions
were noted.
A high score on the worries index
was associated with an increased risk for
functional gastrointestinal disease. The
worries index was also strongly related to
mortality and to incidence of ischemic
heart disease, cancer, hypertension, and
stroke in the unadjusted analyses. Adjust-
ment for age, sex, smoking, health status,
SES, and duration ofhealth plan member-
ship abolished these relationships.
The unadjusted affect balance score
was significantly associated with mortal-
ity, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and
functional gastrointestinal disease. After
adjustment, the affect balance scale was
not signifcantly associated with any of
these outcomes, but low affect balance
was marginally related to elevated risks of
death and stroke.
To assess the degree to which the
addition of the mental health variables
improved the fit ofa model involving only
covariates, we reran all the models with-
out the mental health variables (i.e., with
covariates only). We then used the like-
lihood ratio test to determine whether the
main effects models of covariates alone
were significantly improved by the addi-
tion of the four mental health indices.
Addition of the depression, Langner
mental health, and worries indices to the
model produced highly significant im-
provements in the model for all out-
comes except in the case of the worries
index as a predictor of stroke. P values
associated with these chi-squares were
extremely small-in most instances,
much less than .0001. The affect balance
scale was not associated with a signifi-
cant improvement in the model for any of
the outcomes except cancer incidence
(P < .005).
Diwiuss~ion
These analyses show a strong pro-
spective association between the mental
health, depression, and the worries indi-
ces, on the one hand, and the first inci-
dence of functional gastrointestinal dis-
ease and a group of diseases we classified
as diseases of hyperimmunity, on the
other. Unfortunately, this latter grouping
was created for other reasons, and we
were not able to break up that group into
its major component parts (allergies/hay
fever, asthma, osteoarthritis, autoimnmune
diseases). We plan to do so in the future.
In the adjusted models, psychological in-
dices were not related to mortality hazard
(except possibly for depression among
men only) or to the incidence of major
morbidities such as ischemic heart disease
and cancer. The unadjusted worries and
affect balance indices were strongly re-
lated to these outcomes, however, empha-
sizing the importance of appropriate
adjustments when analyzing the relation-
ships of psychological variables to mor-
bidity and mortality.
The relationship of three of the four
indices to functional gastrointestinal and
hyperimmune conditions is intriguing.
Functional gastrointestinal diseases obvi-
ously have a strong psychological compo-
nent. But, to our knowledge, this is the
first evidence that a depression index, the
Langner Mental Health Index, and the
Bradburn Worries Scale can be used to
identify those at high risk for future func-
tional gastrointestinal disease. A 1957
studyofarmyrecruits28probablygave rise
to the general perception that personality
and ulcer are linked, but no well-con-
trolled studies exist that confirm this com-
monly held perception. Similarly, arthri-
tis, particularly rheumatoid arthritis, is
often perceived to be related to psycho-
logical factors. Persons with rheumatoid
arthritis have more psychological prob-
lems than controls and appear to have
more psychological stress.29 Certainly,
rheumatoid arthritis is involved with im-
mune response. But prospective studies

on these issues are woefully lacking. Is it
possible to intervene with appropriate
therapy for those who score high on these
indices and thereby to reduce future func-
tional gastrointestinal conditions and/or
conditions associated with excessive
inflammatory/immune response? This
question deserves further attention.
There are well-descnibed biochemi-
cal pathways that might link hypothalam-
ic-adrenocortical hormones to the risk of
heart disease and cancer.30,31 Despite the
common, yet relatively undocumented,
knowledge that periods of stress are re-
lated to exacerbations of asthma, aller-
gies, and arthritis, there is no comparable
biological model to account for the rela-
tionships between psychological factors
and excessive immune response. There
have been observations that persons with
allergies are at decreased risk for cancer,32
but little has been done to specifywhether
(or how) psychological states might be in-
volved. The present study suggests that
perhaps these morbidities are linked to
psychological states. This study has also
examined the relationships of social net-
works18 and other psychosocial variables
to these outcomes.
Although the depression and mental
health indices are highly correlated, only
the formerwas inverselyrelated to the risk
of newly diagnosed hypertension. Physi-
cians may be less likely to diagnose
asymptomatic conditions such as hyper-
tension in depressed patients than in non-
depressed patients, and/or depression
may be associated with reductions in
blood pressure. There is no basis for at-
tributing this inverse relationship to anti-
depressant medications. Such medication
might, in fact, be expected to increase
blood pressure.
Although affect balance, a measure
of well-being, tended to be negatively re-
lated to the risk ofdeath and stroke, itwas
not significantly associatedwith any ofthe
study outcomes after adjustment for co-
variates.
Persons under 30 years of age were
more depressed and more worried and
had more long-term mental health symp-
toms than other age groups. Only affect-
balance was vtorse among the old than the
young. The high completion rate (92%) of
the random sample suggests that these
findings are not the result of a healthyvol-
unteer effect and that age does not lead to
a general deterioration in these aspects of
mental health. Indeed, some aspects ap-
pear to improve with age.
Of course, many comparisons were
performed in conducting these explor-
atory analyses, and some significant asso-
ciations might be expected by chance
alone. However, the associations re-
ported here areverypowerful, and few are
likely to have resulted from chance. It is
possible that specific morbid conditions
present at baseline may have confounded
the observed relationships. Further explo-
ration of the relationships of these mental
health indices to morbid conditions would
help to detect such problems.
Further exploration of the relation-
ships between psychological states and
the future risk of functional gastrointesti-
nal and hyperimmune conditions is war-
ranted. In particular, the relationship of
these measures to the subcomponent con-
ditions that make up the hyperimmune
group would be of interest.
