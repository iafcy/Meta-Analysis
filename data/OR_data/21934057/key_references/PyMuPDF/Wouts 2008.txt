Context: Previous research suggests that depression is
a risk factor for stroke. However, the reliability of much
research is limited by the lack of documentation on the
presence of preexistent cardiovascular disease and by the
use of limited measures of depression or stroke.
Objectives: To test the hypotheses that (1) clinically
relevant depressive symptoms are an independent risk
factor of incident stroke in cardiac and noncardiac pa-
tients and (2) more chronic and severe depressive symp-
toms are associated with incident stroke.
Design: A cohort of elderly Dutch people (aged 55
years) was followed up for 9 years in the Longitudinal
Aging Study Amsterdam (baseline measurements were
taken in 1992 or 1993, and the study concluded in 2001
or 2002, respectively).
Setting: General community.
Participants: Randomly selected population-based
sample (N=2965) without a history of stroke.
Main Outcome Measures: The study end point was
a first stroke (nonfatal or fatal). Depression was mea-
sured using the National Institute of Mental Health Di-
agnostic Interview Schedule and the Center for Epide-
miological Studies–Depression Scale. Multivariate Cox
proportional hazards regression analyses of stroke inci-
dence were performed. The association of the chronic-
ity and severity of depressive symptoms was studied in
extended models with time-dependent variables.
Results: The sample’s mean (SD) age was 70.5 (8.7) years,
52.1% were women, and the mean (SD) follow-up was
7.7 (3.1) years. Inclusion of an interaction between car-
diac disease and clinically relevant depressive symp-
toms improved the model for stroke (P=.03). In partici-
pants with preexistent cardiac disease, but not in
participants without cardiac disease, clinically relevant
depressive symptoms at baseline (hazard ratio [HR], 2.18;
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-4.09) and the sever-
ity (range, 0-60; HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13) and chro-
nicity (HR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.13-10.93) of symptoms dur-
ing follow-up were associated with stroke.
Conclusions: Preexistent cardiac disease moderates the
association between depressive symptoms and incident
stroke. In cardiac patients, baseline depressive symp-
toms and both the severity and chronicity of symptoms
during follow-up are associated with incident stroke.

EPRESSION IS HIGHLY
prevalent among elderly
individuals, with a re-
ported prevalence in the
community of 1.8% for
major depression, 9.8% for minor depres-
sion, and 13.5% for clinically relevant de-
pressive symptoms (CRDSs).1 Although
cross-sectional studies2,3 have shown de-
pression to be associated with poor health,
functional impairment, decreased qual-
ity of life, and greater use of health ser-
vices, prospective studies4 have shown de-
pression and depressive symptoms to be
independentdeterminantsofmortality.Re-
cently, myocardial infarction was shown
to be a mediator of the higher mortality
of depressed individuals.5,6 The biologi-
cal pathways hypothesized to link depres-
sion with cardiovascular disease include
sympathetic nervous system activation,
dysregulation of the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenocortical axis, platelet ag-
gregation dysfunction, and inflamma-
tion.7,8
Studies investigating whether depres-
sion is also a risk factor for the develop-
ment of cerebrovascular events have
yielded mixed results. The recent consen-
sus guideline of the American Heart
Association and the American Stroke As-
sociation for the prevention of cerebro-
vascular events does not mention depres-
sion as a possible risk factor for stroke.9

In a recent meta-analysis,5 the pooled relative risk of stroke
in those with a depressed mood was 1.4 (range, 1.2-
1.8), but this estimated risk was influenced by the meth-
odologic shortcomings and heterogeneity of the studies
included. In particular, most of the early studies used lim-
ited measures of depression, with only 2 using the DSM-IV
to diagnose depression. The first of these studies used
self-reported data on the occurrence of stroke, and the
second used physician-reported ICD-10–classified car-
diovascular disease.10,11 Neither study documented the
chronicity and severity of depression. Another source of
heterogeneity in studies of the relationship between de-
pressive symptoms and stroke is the possible moderat-
ing effect of cardiac disease. Because cardiac disease is
an important predictor of stroke, stratifying by cardiac
disease divides the population into low- and high-risk
populations. If one assumes that the pathophysiologic
mechanisms are comparable to those leading to cardio-
vascular disease in depressed individuals, depression in
cardiac patients could aggravate the existing atheroscle-
rotic disease, ultimately leading to stroke. Furthermore,
the prevalence and incidence of depression would be ex-
pected to be higher in cardiac patients based on the vas-
cular depression hypothesis, which states that subclini-
cal underlying cerebrovascular disease may cause
depression.12-16 According to this hypothesis, underly-
ing atherosclerotic disease could give rise to both stroke
and depression in cardiac patients. Bearing in mind
these sources of heterogeneity in earlier studies, we in-
vestigated whether the presence, severity, and chronic-
ity of depressive symptoms and major depressive disor-
der (MDD) are independently associated with incident
stroke in elderly patients with or without cardiac dis-
ease during a 9-year follow-up.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION
This study was conducted within the Longitudinal Aging Study
Amsterdam(LASA),whichisaprospectivecohortstudyofDutch
people aged 55 to 85 years. The LASA started in 1992, and its
methods have been described in detail elsewhere.17,18 The gen-
eral aim of LASA was to study the autonomy and well-being of
an aging population. A randomly selected age- and sex-
stratified sample (according to expected mortality figures) was
drawn from the population registers of 11 municipalities in the
Netherlands. The reason for this relative oversampling of older
old people (both men and women) and elderly men was to com-
pensate for an anticipated higher unavailability for follow-up
among physically frail people. The initial response rate was
62.3%, and nonresponse was associated with age, sex, and ur-
banicity. The sample first took part in the cross-sectional
NESTOR–living arrangements and social networks study19 and
was later interviewed and followed up every 3 years in LASA;
81.7% of the NESTOR–living arrangements and social net-
works study population participated in LASA, with nonre-
sponse being related to age but not to sex. All interviews were
recorded for quality control purposes. All LASA participants
without a history of stroke at the baseline measurement were
eligible for inclusion (n=3018).
Participants in whom depressive symptoms (51 [1.6%]) or
stroke (2 [0.06%]) were not evaluated at baseline were ex-
cluded. The remaining 2965 individuals participated in this study
of the association among depressive symptoms, CRDSs, or MDD
at baseline and incident stroke in patients with or without car-
diac disease at baseline. The mean (SD) follow-up was 7.7 (3.1)
years; participants were assessed at baseline and every 3 years.
For the extended Cox proportional hazards regression analy-
ses, we required the availability of a baseline and at least 1 fol-
low-up assessment of depression. In total, 412 participants
(13.9%) were excluded because they had died or had a stroke
before the first follow-up interview, and 328 participants
(11.1%) were excluded because they never had a follow-up as-
sessment of depressive symptoms. Unavailablity for follow-up
of depressive symptoms was associated with an older age, a lower
score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), more
functional limitations, and cardiac disease (P.001 for all). The
mean (SD) follow-up for the remaining 2225 participants was
9.1 (1.7) years, with a mean (SD) number of 3.4 (0.8) mea-
surements of depressive symptoms.
MEASUREMENTS
Stroke Morbidity and Mortality
The study end point was the first occurrence of stroke (fatal or
nonfatal). Nonfatal strokes were established based on self-
report during the 3-yearly interviews and information ob-
tained from general practitioners (GPs) in response to ques-
tionnaires sent in 1992-1993, 1995-1996, and 2000-2001. The
GPs were asked whether a participant had ever been diag-
nosed as having a cerebrovascular accident, the year in which
it occurred, and whether a specialist had confirmed the diag-
nosis. Previous research in LASA had shown such self-
reported information to be moderately accurate (concordance
with GP: =0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.64).20
Therefore, we considered a stroke to have occurred if the self-
reported and GP information were consistent or if a cardiac spe-
cialist confirmed the GP diagnosis of stroke. Death due to stroke
was established based on death certificates registered by the
Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics. Death certificates of
deceased participants were 100% complete. Stroke was de-
fined as ICD-9 codes 431, 433, 434, and 436 and ICD-10 codes
I-61, I-63, and I-64. The event was timed as occurring in the
year halfway between the 3-yearly assessments for nonfatal
strokes and as the year of death for fatal strokes.
Depression
Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epi-
demiological Studies–Depression Scale (CES-D). This is a widely
used instrument to measure depressive symptoms in the com-
munity.21 In LASA, the traditional cutoff of the CES-D of 16 or
greater had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% for
MDD.22 Major depressive disorder was diagnosed using the Na-
tional Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Sched-
ule (DIS).23 Subthreshold depressive disorder (SDD) was di-
agnosed if a study participant scored 16 or higher on the CES-D
but did not meet DSM-III diagnostic criteria for MDD on the
DIS. The SDD category included 107 respondents with a CES-D
score of 16 or higher but no available DIS diagnosis. We use
the term CRDSs were refer to the broad category of MDD or
SDD, and we use the term depressive symptoms to refer to the
score on the CES-D (range, 0-60).
TheDISandCES-Dwerecompletedevery3years,whichmade
it possible to estimate the mean severity of depressive symptoms
and the chronicity of CRDSs and MDD during the follow-up. The
mean severity of depressive symptoms was defined as the mean
CES-D score of all observations until the year of the first stroke
or censoring divided by the total number of observations in this

interval. The chronicity of MDD was defined as the total number
of observations of MDD until the year of the first stroke (or cen-
soring) divided by the total number of observations in this inter-
val. The chronicity of CRDSs was the total number of observa-
tions of an MDD or a score on the CES-D of 16 or higher until
theyearofthefirststroke(orcensoring)dividedbythetotalnum-
ber of observations in this interval.
Cardiac Disease
Cardiac disease was defined as myocardial infarction, conges-
tive heart failure, angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia and
established at baseline using an algorithm used earlier in LASA.6
Thisalgorithmuses3sourcesofinformation:self-reported,medi-
cation, and GP information. We considered only 1 confirma-
tive source necessary for diagnosis because self-reported car-
diac disease is sufficiently accurate in LASA (concordance with
GP: =0.69; 95% CI, 0.65-0.73).20 We used a broad definition
of cardiac disease because although it could lead to a type II
error (overcorrection), the use of a more restricted definition
could lead to a type I error (undercorrection), and we pre-
ferred to use the broader category.
Confounders
Sociodemographic variables (sex and age), general health-
related variables (functional limitations and cognitive impair-
ments), and important stroke risk factors (diabetes mellitus,
smoking, hypertension, and obesity) were included in the analy-
ses as potential confounders. The number of functional limi-
tations was scored with a 3-item questionnaire24 as none, 1, or
2 or more. Cognitive impairments were measured with the
MMSE.25 A history of diabetes mellitus was considered pres-
ent if reported by the respondent, if the person used antidia-
betic agents, or if a GP confirmed the diagnosis. The variable
smoking included current smoking. Blood pressure was mea-
sured every 3 years, preferably from the arm but otherwise from
the fingertip. Hypertension was categorized into stage 1 hy-
pertension (a mean systolic blood pressure of 140-159 mm Hg
or a mean diastolic blood pressure of 90-99 mm Hg) and stage
2 hypertension (a mean systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg
or a mean diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg).26 Obe-
sity was defined as a body mass index (calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30 or
greater.2,27 Antidepressant use was established by asking about
the use of medication and by visually checking all of the par-
ticipants’ medications at each 3-yearly assessment.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
All primary variables and covariates were checked for normal-
ity, colinearity, and proportionality of hazards. Missing data for
covariates were restored by imputation of the most reported
value, and the results for analyses with or without imputed data
were checked for differences.28 Baseline characteristics for par-
ticipants with or without depressive symptoms were com-
pared using 2 and t tests. Univariate Cox proportional haz-
ards analyses of first strokes were conducted for primary and
secondary variables. Models of stroke incidence, which in-
cluded interaction terms of depression variables (depressive
symptoms, CRDSs, and MDD) by cardiac disease status, were
tested by multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analy-
ses. Subsequently, the sample was stratified for cardiac dis-
ease, and the relationship between depression variables and in-
cident stroke was examined by multivariate Cox proportional
hazard regression analysis. We used extended Cox propor-
tional hazard models to examine the association between the
severity of depressive symptoms or the chronicity of CRDSs or
MDD and incident stroke, with these depression variables and
possible confounders as time-dependent variables.29
RESULTS
BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS
The mean (SD) age of the 2965 elderly study partici-
pants (52.1% female) was 70.5 (8.7) years, and 39.6%
had 1 or more functional limitations (Table 1). At base-
line, 58 (2.0%) had MDD and 372 (12.5%) had SDD. Myo-
cardial infarction was reported in 285 (9.6%), conges-
tive heart failure in 256 (8.7%), angina pectoris in
283 (9.5%), and cardiac arrhythmia in 132 (4.4%). The
CRDSs at baseline were associated with older age
(P.001), female sex (P.001), more functional limi-
tations (P.001), poorer performance on the MMSE
(P.001), smoking (P=.04), diabetes mellitus (P=.03),
and cardiac disease (P.001).
The overall rate of stroke was 7.7 per 1000 person-
years: the rate of first nonfatal stroke was 2.8 per 1000 per-
son-years, and the rate of fatal stroke was 4.9 per 1000 per-
son-years. The rate of incident stroke was higher, but not
significantly so, among participants with CRDSs at base-
line (P=.10), as shown in Table 2. On univariate analy-
sis, cardiac disease at baseline (P.001), older age
(P.001),poorerMMSEperformance(P.01),morefunc-
tionallimitations(P.01),diabetesmellitus(P.001),and
hypertension (P.001) were associated with a higher in-
cidence of stroke. The use of antidepressants (49 partici-
pants[1.7%])wasnotassociatedwithincidentstroke(haz-
ard ratio [HR], 0.35; 95% CI, 0.05-2.52; P=.30).

cident stroke was higher in those with cardiac disease and
CRDSs compared with those with cardiac disease but with-
out CRDSs. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards re-
gression demonstrated that inclusion of the interaction
term CRDScardiac disease (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.09-
5.56; P=.03) significantly improved the model for inci-
dent stroke (2=4.7, P=.03), as did inclusion of the in-
teraction term depressive symptomscardiac disease
(HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; P=.01). Other potentially
relevant interaction terms, such as depressive sym-
ptoms  diabetes mellitus (P = .65), depressive
symptomsstage 1 hypertension (P=.69), depressive
symptomsstage 2 hypertension (P=.93), and depres-
sive symptomssmoking (P=.85), were not signifi-
cantly related to incident stroke.
DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND INCIDENT
STROKE IN PATIENTS WITH AND WITHOUT
CARDIAC DISEASE
Stratification of the sample into those with or without
cardiac disease at baseline showed that in patients with
cardiac disease the presence of CRDSs at baseline was as-
sociated with a higher incidence of stroke even after cor-
rection for possible confounders (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.17-
4.09; P=.02) (Table 3).
The extended multivariate Cox proportional hazards
regression model for first stroke included time-
dependent depression variables (the mean severity of de-
pressive symptoms, the chronicity of CRDSs, and the chro-
nicity of MDD), possible confounders measured at
baseline, and changes in hypertension or functional limi-
tations during the follow-up period. The chronicity of
CRDSs during follow-up was an independent predictor
of incident stroke (HR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.13-10.93; P=.03).
The chronicity of MDD was not significantly associated
with incident stroke (HR, 5.59; 95% CI, 0.77-40.56;
P=.09). In addition, the mean severity of depressive symp-
toms during follow-up was significantly associated with
an incident stroke (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13; P=.005).
Results were similar for men and women, and correc-
tion for cardiac medication did not significantly influ-
ence the associations found.
The CRDSs at baseline were not significantly associ-
ated with incident stroke in patients without cardiac dis-
ease at baseline (Table 3) and neither were the chronic-
ity of CRDSs nor the mean severity of symptoms during
follow-up.
COMMENT
This study shows that cardiac disease moderates the as-
sociation between CRDSs and incident stroke. In car-
diac patients, there seemed to be a dose-response effect
in that both the severity and the chronicity of depres-
sive symptoms during follow-up were predictors of in-
cident stroke. This relationship was not observed in pa-
tients without cardiac disease at baseline.
Our findings are in line with previous research of the
relationship between depressive symptoms and the in-
cidence of stroke in populations with a high cardiovas-
cular risk, such as patients with hypertension or dia-
betes mellitus,30-32 and offer an explanation for negative
results. They are also consistent with previous stud-
ies12,33,34 reporting a poorer cardiac prognosis and an in-
creased mortality among cardiac patients with depres-
sion. Our study shows that the cerebrovascular prognosis
of cardiac patients with depressive symptoms is worse,
as is the cardiac prognosis, and this may be a factor un-
derlying the higher mortality seen in depressed cardiac
patients.

Nevertheless, these findings have some limitations.
First, stroke was not confirmed by neuroimaging and,
thus, no distinction was made between ischemic and hem-
orrhagic stroke. Pathophysiologically, depression would
be expected to be primarily associated with ischemic
stroke. Misclassification due to overreporting of stroke
is probably not a major issue because self-reported stroke
had to be confirmed by a GP or a specialist. Although
there was selective dropout, with the more frail indi-
viduals being more likely to have missing data on de-
pression during follow-up, this would tend to lead to a
conservative estimate of the relationship between de-
pressive symptoms and incident stroke. The relatively few
participants with an MDD at baseline (n=58) limited the
power to find associations between MDD and stroke. How-
ever, the use of a broader category of CRDSs, which in-
cluded MDD and SDD, is in line with research showing
that subsyndromal depressive states form a continuum
with major depression in elderly populations.35-37 Fur-
thermore, the strongest results were found when depres-
sive symptoms were used as a continuous measure (based
on the CES-D), and the results for time-dependent analy-
sis of an association between MDD and stroke in cardiac
patients pointed in the same direction. Last, we did not
fully control for the severity of cardiac disease because
of the lack of electrocardiographic or ultrasonographic
information.12
As strong points, we used a clinical diagnosis of de-
pression in combination with a valid measurement of
depressive symptoms and required confirmation of self-
reported stroke by the patients’ GPs, a method that has
been validated in LASA,20 or by information obtained
from the death certificate. We also assessed depressive
disorders and symptoms, functional limitations, and
blood pressure during follow-up, which enabled us to
use adjusted extended Cox proportional hazards mod-
els with time-dependent variables. These extended
models are probably more realistic because depression
has a fluctuating course, and these models incorporate
all available information about depression and depres-
sive symptoms. We also distinguished between partici-
pants with and without cardiac disease at baseline,
which enabled us to establish that cardiac disease mod-
erates the relationship between stroke and depressive
symptoms.
To understand how cardiac disease moderates the
association between depression and stroke morbidity
and mortality, we initially have to consider why depres-
sion is associated with incident stroke in cardiac
patients. Depression could aggravate atherosclerosis
and in this way worsen the prognosis of cardiac
patients, which could explain the dose-response effect
that we found. Suggested pathways by which depres-
sion could specifically affect the vascular system of car-
diac patients are a diminished heart rate variability,
altered platelet responses,8 more arrhythmia in
depressed patients with premature ventricular contrac-
tions,38 as well as behavioral pathways, such as poorer
compliance with cardiac treatment and a less healthy
lifestyle.39 At the same time, the vascular depression
hypothesis suggests that subclinical underlying cerebro-
vascular disease can cause depression in cardiac pa-
tients.13 The relationship between depression and vas-
cular diseases seems to be reciprocal.40,41 This reciprocal
relationship could be synergistic in cardiac patients but
not in patients without cardiac disease. This would
explain the interaction between cardiac disease and de-
pression found in our study.
An alternative explanation for our findings is that de-
pressive symptoms are an indicator of a poor prognosis in
cardiac patients because the number of depressive symp-
toms is (partly) associated with the severity of underlying
cardiovasculardisease.42WechosetousetheCES-Dtoscore
depressive symptoms because, when LASA was designed,
studies showed that the overlap with physical illness was
limited.43,44 A more recent study45 of patients undergoing
cardiac surgery showed that the CES-D detected change
after this intervention, not only shortly after surgery but
also later during follow-up, which suggests that depres-
sive symptoms, as measured with the CES-D, benefit from
an improvement in cardiovascular status. Moreover, trials
of antidepressants in depressed patients after myocardial
infarction do not consistently report less long-term depres-
sion or a better cardiac prognosis, which suggests that de-
pressive symptoms may in part be due to the severity of
the underlying cardiac disease.46-49

In conclusion, cardiac disease moderates the associa-
tion between CRDSs and incident stroke. This moder-
ating effect of cardiac disease could be explained not only
by a synergistic effect of the reciprocal mechanisms be-
tween vascular disease and depression but also by de-
pressive symptoms being an indicator of the severity of
underlying cardiac disease. Both explanations deserve
more attention in further research because they have im-
plications for targeting effective interventions. At least,
depression in cardiac patients seems to be an indicator
of a poorer prognosis to some extent because of the higher
incidence of stroke among these patients, as this study
showed.
