Severely Depressed Young Patients Have Over Five Times
Increased Risk for Stroke: A 5-Year Follow-Up Study
Hsin-Chien Lee, Herng-Ching Lin, and Shang-Ying Tsai
Background: This study aims to estimate the risk of developing stroke within 5 years of discharge among young patients ages 18 to
approximately 44 who were hospitalized for depressive disorders.
Methods: Our study design features a study cohort and a comparison cohort. The study cohort included patients ages 18 to approximately
44 who were hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of depressive disorder (n  827), whereas the comparison cohort consisted of 4,135
patients selected randomly (ﬁve for every depressed patient) and matched with the study group in terms of gender, age, and date of
discharge. Each patient was tracked for 5 years after their discharge in 1998. Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed to
compute the 5-year stroke-free survival rates after adjusting for possible confounding factors.
Results: Duringthe5-yearfollow-upperiod,50depressedpatients(6.05%ofthestudycohort)and48non-depressedsubjects(1.16%ofthe
comparisoncohort)developedstrokes.Theadjustedhazardofstrokewas5.43(95%conﬁdenceinterval3.47–8.51,p.001)timesgreater
for depressed patients than for non-depressed subjects.
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings show young patients ages 18 to approximately 44 who were hospitalized for depressive disorders were at over
ﬁve times greater risk of developing stroke within 5 years of discharge compared with non-depressed age- and gender-matched subjects.
Key Words: Depressed patients, depression, stroke
A
leading cause of disability, depressive disorders were
estimated to account for 4.4% of total disability-adjusted
life years in the year 2000 (1). A great health burden in
this population does not come from the depressive illness per se
but stems from its high association with several comorbid
medical conditions (2).
In recent decades, the relationship between depression and
cardiovascular disease has attracted much attention. Depression
is now considered to be a major risk factor for development of
cardiovascular disorders (3). As regards other vascular disorders,
the association between depression and stroke has likewise been
observed for years (4) but has until now focused on depression
as a consequence of stroke (5).
A recent report based on the Framingham Heart Study shows
a 4.21 times greater risk of developing stroke among depressed
participants under 65 years of age as compared with non-
depressed participants (6). Still, information directly linking depres-
sive disorder to stroke is scant and controversial (7–9). The present
study aims to estimate the risk of developing stroke within 5 years
of discharge among severely depressed patients ages 18–44, as
compared with age- and gender-matched subjects.
Methods and Materials
Database
This study used the National Health Insurance Research Data-
base (NHIRD). The dataset included all medical claims data from the
Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) program, which currently
enrolls approximately 97% of the country’s population. Hundreds of
published papers have used the NHIRD as the basis for their studies
(10). Because the NHIRD consists of de-identified secondary data
released to the public for research purposes, this study was exempt
from full review by the Internal Review Board.
Study Sample
The study cohort consisted of severely depressed patients
ages 18 to approximately 44 who were discharged during 1998.
Severely depressed patients were defined as those with depres-
sive disorders (ICD-9-Clinical Modification [CM] codes 296.2,
296.3, 300.4, and 311) severe enough to be hospitalized (11).
To ensure the validity of diagnoses and to avoid chronicity,
we excluded patients hospitalized for any type of mental disor-
der (ICD-9-CM codes 290–319) during the previous 2-year period
and those who developed any other major psychiatric disorder
during the follow-up period. Patients who had previous strokes
(ICD-9-CM codes 430–438) were also excluded.
Our comparison cohort was extracted from the NHIRD sub-
dataset consisting of 1,073,891 randomly selected subjects, ap-
proximately 5% of all enrollees in the NHI program. Subjects
were excluded if they had been diagnosed with any other mental
disorder or previous stroke. We chose our final comparison
cohort from this representative dataset by randomly selecting five
patients for every depressed one, matched by age (18 to approx-
imately 29 and 30 to approximately 44, in accordance with a prior
study [7]), gender, and the date of discharge. Ultimately, there
were 827 patients and 4,135 subjects in the study and comparison
cohorts, respectively.
Each sampled case was tracked 5 years from the date of
discharge to identify whether stroke occurred. The data were linked
to Taiwan death certificate data, with cases censored if individuals
died from non-stroke causes during that time. Sociodemographic
variables included gender, age, monthly income, level of urbaniza-
tion (five standardized levels published by the Taiwan National
Health Research Institute) and geographic location of the commu-
nity in which the patient resided. The reason we selected NT$15,840
as the first income level cutoff point was that this is the government-
stipulated minimum wage for full-time employees in Taiwan. De-
tails on substance use and comorbid medical disorders at the time of
the index discharge were also collected.

Statistical Analysis
The SAS statistical package (SAS System for Windows, Version
8.2; Cary, North Carolina) was used. Pearson 2 tests were carried
out to distinguish differences between the study and comparison
cohorts. The 5-year stroke-free survival rate was estimated with
the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test to examine the
differences in the risk of developing stroke between the two
cohorts. Cox proportional hazard regressions were then per-
formed to compute the 5-year survival rate, adjusting for vari-
ables that were significantly related to stroke from the prior 2
analyses. Finally, we present hazard ratios (HR) along with 95%
confidence intervals (95% CI) with a significance level of .05.
Results
Table 1 presents the distributions of demographic character-
istics and comorbid medical disorders for the study and compar-
ison cohorts. It shows that severely depressed patients were
more likely to have certain medical comorbidities at baseline.
During the 5-year follow-up period, 50 depressed patients
(6.05% of the study cohort) and 48 non-depressed subjects (1.16%
of the comparison cohort) developed strokes. The log-rank test
indicated that severely depressed patients had significantly lower
5-year stroke-free survival rates (p  .001). (Figure 1).
Table 2 presents the adjusted hazard ratios for stroke by
cohort. After adjusting for sociodemographic variables, comorbid
medical disorders, and substance abuse, the hazard of develop-
ing stroke during the 5-year follow-up period was 5.43 (95%
CI  3.47–8.51, p  .001) times greater for severely depressed
patients than for subjects in the comparison cohort.
Discussion
The results of this study demonstrate that young, severely
depressed patients are at more than five times greater risk of

developing stroke within 5 years of discharge, as compared with
non-depressed age- and gender-matched subjects, after adjusting
for other risk factors.
The association between depression and stroke has been
mainly based on community-based studies of people with de-
pressive symptoms rather than depressive disorders (12–14). In
term of depressive disorders, Larson et al. (7) reported a two- to
three-times greater risk over a 13-year follow-up period of
developing stroke among community-dwelling persons with a
lifetime history of depressive disorders. However, the limited
number of persons with depressive disorders at baseline (n 
128) and the accuracy of stroke incidence measured by self-
reporting could compromise their findings. A large-scale com-
munity-based study in the U.K. indicated that elevated stroke risk
is associated with psychological distress but not episodic major
depressive disorder (9). Because the psychiatric diagnosis was
made on the basis of a self-administered questionnaire, it could
be different from clinical depression and confounded by recall
bias.
Our findings are consistent with results by Nilsson and
Kessing (8), which found that patients with depression severe
enough to be hospitalized had a 1.22 times increased risk of
stroke compared with those with osteoarthritis. Given that the
majority of the patients sampled were older, the authors ad-
dressed the medical need for stroke prevention only among the
severely depressed elderly population. However, the great mag-
nitude of risk observed strongly suggests this warning applies
also to persons younger than 45 years old.
The increased risk of stroke among depressed persons has
been considered to be mediated by unhealthy behaviors includ-
ing smoking, poor diet, and lack of exercise (15). Despite the
absence of such information within our dataset, previous studies
suggest that the increased stroke risk among depressed persons
cannot be fully explained by such unhealthy behaviors (9,14).
Researchers have proposed similar models linking depressive
disorders to stroke mainly extrapolated from findings on the
occurrence of cardiovascular disorders among depressed people
(3). Therefore, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and incidental
physiological changes such as increased platelet activation, high
sympathetic tone, increased inflammatory markers, and endothe-
lial dysfunction, although not specific to stroke, are of research
interest (16). Decreased cerebrovascular reactivity associated
with a higher risk of stroke has been found among patients with
major depressive disorder (17,18). A common etiological basis
for depression and stroke might exist.
Recently, the risk of stroke associated with antidepressant use
has begun to draw increasing attention. Chen et al. (19) reported
that the risk of stroke was 1.55 times higher in patients with
current exposure to selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, the
most commonly used antidepressant drugs, as compared with
nonusers. That could potentially explain the greater risk found in
this study compared with previous ones, because sampled
depressed patients in this study were much more likely to take
antidepressant drugs long-term after discharge compared with
those whose depressive disorders were not severe enough to
require hospital stay.
Our findings need to be interpreted in the context of two

inherent limitations of administrative datasets. First, depressive
disorders and stroke diagnoses totally reliant upon administrative
claims data might be less accurate than those made through a
standardized procedure. Secondly, individual information on as
dietary habits, cigarette smoking, and body mass index, which
contribute to stroke, were not available in the dataset. Further-
more, differences in the use of psychotropic and other medica-
tions between the study and comparison cohorts were not taken
into consideration. Likewise, the NHIRD does not contain data
regarding the patient’s duration of illness and number of depres-
sion episodes. Finally, subtypes of stroke were not taken into
consideration for the analyses. These limitations might compro-
mise our findings.
Given that the co-occurrence of depression and stroke places
an enormous burden not only on patients and their families but
also on health care systems and societies, further studies are
needed to replicate these findings and to verify whether young,
severely depressed patients are at increased risk of stroke for
reasons inherently related to their depressive disorder or related
to resultant lifestyle and treatment.
