ABSTRACT
Background: We evaluated whether depressive symptoms predict the onset of first stroke inde-
pendently of memory impairment. We conceptualized memory impairment as a marker of preex-
isting cerebrovascular disease. We hypothesized that if depressive symptoms are causally
related to stroke through mechanisms unrelated to cerebrovascular disease, depressive symp-
toms should predict stroke independently of memory impairment.
Methods: Incidence of first stroke was assessed with self or proxy reports from 19,087 partici-
pants in the Health and Retirement Study cohort (1,864 events). Elevated depressive symptoms
(3 on an 8-item Centers for the Epidemiologic Study of Depression scale) and memory impair-
ment (score of 6 on a combined immediate and delayed recall of a 10-word list) were used as
predictors of incident stroke in Cox survival models with adjustment for sociodemographic and
cardiovascular risk factors.
Results: After adjustment for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors, elevated depres-
sive symptoms (hazard ratio  1.25; 95% confidence interval 1.12–1.39) and memory impair-
ment (hazard ratio  1.26; 95% confidence interval 1.13–1.41) each predicted stroke incidence
in separate models. Hazard ratios were nearly unchanged and remained significant (1.23 for ele-
vated depressive symptoms and 1.25 for memory impairment) when models were simultaneously
adjusted for both elevated depressive symptoms and memory impairment. Elevated depressive
symptoms also predicted stroke when restricting analyses to individuals with median memory
score or better.
Conclusions: Memory impairments and depressive symptoms independently predict stroke inci-
dence. Memory impairment may reflect undiagnosed cerebrovascular disease. These results sug-
gest that depressive symptoms might be directly related to stroke rather than merely indicating
preexisting cerebrovascular disease. Neurology® 2010;75:2063–2070

Stroke incidence is predicted by both cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms.1-12 Asso-
ciations are most consistent using measures of depressive symptoms,7-12 but are also apparent
with diagnostic measures of depression.5,6
Impaired cognitive performance correlates with indicators of subclinical cerebrovascular
disease, such as white matter hyperintensities,13-15 and is probably an early manifestation of
vascular brain injury. However, it is uncertain whether depressive symptoms are markers of the
same cerebrovascular pathologic process or represent independent physiologic mechanisms
influencing stroke. Depressive symptoms are common sequelae of stroke16 and subclinical
cerebrovascular injuries are hypothesized to induce “vascular depression”; thus depressive

symptoms may be merely markers for preex-
isting cerebrovascular disease.17-19 This inter-
pretation implies that depression does not
cause stroke, so treating or reducing depres-
sive symptoms would not reduce stroke risk.
In contrast to this hypothesis, depression
may increase stroke risk, via vascular disease
or acute stroke triggering mechanisms. De-
pression in healthy or patient samples is asso-
ciated with adverse behavioral changes,20 as
well as physiologic disturbances affecting in-
flammatory pathways, the autonomic nervous
system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis, and amygdalar regulation of the
HPA, which may all influence stroke risk.21-24
This study aimed to evaluate competing
models of the association between depressive
symptoms and stroke: depression influences
stroke vs depression is a marker of subclinical
cerebrovascular disease. We hypothesized that if
cognitive scores and depressive symptoms are
markers of the same underlying physiologic
pathway, adjustment for cognitive scores should
substantially attenuate the association between
depressive symptoms and stroke incidence.
METHODS Study population. Data come from the
Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a longitudinal national
survey of US adults aged 50 and their spouses. The HRS is
sponsored by the National Institute on Aging (grant NIA
U01AG009740) and is conducted by the University of Michi-
gan. Study details and measurements are provided elsewhere.25
Enrollment was staggered by birth cohort with enrollments in
1992, 1993, and 1998. The 1992 enrollment cohort first re-
ceived standardized depression and memory assessments in
1996, so we consider 1996 interviews baseline for this cohort.
Biennial interviews (or proxy interviews for decedents) were con-
ducted through 2006. We included HRS participants age 50
reporting themselves stroke-free at baseline interview. Original
survey response rates varied across enrollment cohorts (70%–
81%), and retention was high through 2006 (82%–86%).
From 24,372 age-eligible respondents, 1,834 (7.5%) were
excluded due to reporting a stroke that occurred prior to base-
line. From these 22,538 potentially eligible participants, 2,095
(8.6%) were excluded due to missing information on baseline
depressive symptoms or baseline memory, 638 (2.6%) were ex-
cluded due to missing covariates, and 718 (2.9%) were excluded
due to missing follow-up information, leaving 19,087 individu-
als contributing information to the primary analyses (154,751
person-years) and 1,864 events observed.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The HRS is approved by the University of Michigan
Health Sciences Human Subjects Committee and written in-
formed consent was obtained from all participants.
Stroke outcomes. Incident events were defined as first nonfa-
tal or fatal stroke, based on self- or proxy-reported doctor’s diag-
nosis (“Has a doctor ever told you that you had a stroke?”).
Reports of temporary ischemic attacks were not systematically
assessed and so were not coded as strokes. When participants
were deceased or unavailable for direct interviews, proxy infor-
mants, typically spouses, were interviewed. It was not possible to
verify self-reported strokes by clinical diagnosis or medical record
review; our previous research on major risk factors and incident
stroke in HRS suggests bias due to misclassification is modest.26
Respondents reported stroke month and year; events with
unknown date within 2-year interview intervals (n  302) were
assigned the median month for events reported by others in the
same interview wave.
Primary exposures and covariates. Elevated depressive
symptoms were defined as scoring 3 on an 8-item version of
the Centers for Epidemiologic Study of Depression (CES-D)
scale, following prior work.27 Questions elicited yes/no answers:
“Now think about the past week and the feelings you have expe-
rienced. Please tell me if each of the following was true for you
much of the time this past week. Much of the time during the
past week … I felt depressed/felt that everything I did was an
effort/my sleep was restless/could not get going/felt lonely/
enjoyed life/felt sad/was happy.” Cronbach  (measuring inter-
nal consistency) for baseline CES-D was 0.80 (appendix e-1 on
the Neurology® Web site at www.neurology.org). Memory im-
pairment was assessed by summing immediate and delayed recall
of 10-word lists of common nouns. Each word recalled was 1
point (total range 0–20). We classified anyone with a combined
score of 6 as memory impaired.
Additional control variables were added in stages ordered by
their life course timing and relationships with primary exposures.
We first added core demographic covariates: age, age-squared,
race (black or white), Hispanic ethnicity, Southern birth, father’s
and mother’s education of 8 years, and HRS enrollment year.
These variables predict stroke and temporally precede partici-
pants’ current depressive status.26 We next incorporated adjust-
ment for adult social risk factors likely to predict stroke but
potentially influenced by life course depression experiences: years
of education, household income and wealth at baseline (income
and wealth were natural log-transformed to reduce skew), and
marital status (divorced, widowed, never married, or currently
married). The third set of covariates comprises well-established
stroke risk factors that cannot properly be considered confound-
ers because they are probably influenced by prior depressive
symptoms: smoking status (current/past/never), overweight
(body mass index [BMI] 25–30) or obese (BMI 30), moder-
ate alcohol use (3/day or 18/week), or heavy alcohol use
(3/day or 18/week), and self-reported baseline diagnoses of
hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease. Coefficients from mod-
els including these last covariates should not be interpreted as
“causal,” but we show them to assess whether depressive symp-
toms predict stroke independently of these other risk factors. In
supplementary analyses, we controlled for an additional indica-
tor of cognitive impairment, the Telephone Interview for Cogni-
tive Status (TICS, range 0–13),28,29 available for a subsample of
HRS respondents (n  17,798).
Methods of analysis. We show Kaplan-Meier survival curves
adjusted for confounders using inverse probability weighting
(IPW).30 Hazard ratios (HR) for stroke associated with elevated
depressive symptoms and impaired memory scores were esti-
mated with Cox proportional hazard models. The dependent
variable in these models was months from baseline interview to
onset of first stroke (results presented in the metric of person-
years). For those without stroke, person-time was censored at last

interview, or proxy-reported death. We first modeled each pri-
mary exposure (memory impairment and elevated depressive
symptoms) separately, and then simultaneously adjusted in a sin-
gle model. To assess bias from exclusions due to missing data, we
repeated primary analyses applying IPWs calculated as the in-
verse of the probability of observing each respondent, estimated
with a logistic regression model including all covariates described
above. This approach upweights those included sample members
who were similar to others who were excluded. IPW avoids bias
from missingness under the assumption that, conditional on ob-
served covariates, data are missing at random.31 In supplemen-
tary analyses, we examined whether associations differed by sex
and age strata (65).
Primary analyses used baseline CES-D and memory values,
but these variables evolved over time, so that by the 6th wave
(after approximately 12 years), CES-D correlated only 0.41 with
baseline CES-D, and memory score correlated only 0.43 with
baseline word recall. To account for changes in our primary risk
factors, we repeated the Cox models using time updated values
of CES-D and memory, from successive biennial interviews.
We also repeated primary analyses using continuous (instead
of dichotomized) word recall score (range 0–20) and adjusting
for the TICS to improve control for cognitive impairment. To
assess whether depressive symptoms predicted stroke among indi-
viduals with no evidence of memory impairment, we repeated anal-
yses restricting to respondents with a median memory score of 10 or
better at baseline (n  10,685). In the supplementary models, we
adjusted for all “adult social risk factors” described above.
Because vascular depression is hypothesized to have stronger
associations with some symptoms of depression (e.g., apathy)
than others,17,32 we conducted exploratory analyses examining
relationships between each CES-D symptom and incident
stroke. We considered each of the 8 CES-D items one by one
(without adjustment for the other 7 items), then in combination,
and finally in combination when restricted to those with elevated
CES-D score.
Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.1.
RESULTS The crude stroke rate was higher among
subjects with elevated baseline depressive symptoms
(17.8 vs 10.7 per 1,000 person-years), but these indi-
viduals also had worse profiles for several potential
confounders (table 1). At baseline, memory impair-
ment was more common among those with elevated
depressive symptoms (29% vs 16%, p  0.01). The
Spearman correlation between the 8-item CES-D
and continuous memory score was 0.19 (95% con-
fidence interval [CI] 0.21 to 0.18).
Kaplan-Meier curves suggest a survival advantage
of those without elevated depressive symptoms over
those with symptoms, and a survival advantage for
those without memory impairment over participants
with memory impairment (figure 1). Table 2 shows
the results of covariate adjusted Cox proportional
hazards models. In separate models adjusting only
for demographics (top 2 rows of table 2), both base-
line depressive symptom elevation (HR  1.51) and
memory impairment (HR  1.40) were associated
with elevated stroke hazard. HRs changed little when
including both depressive symptom elevation and
memory impairment in the same model (bottom 2
rows in table 2); for example, in the demographic-
adjusted model, the HR for elevated depressive

symptoms declined from 1.51 to 1.47 when memory
impairment was included as a covariate. The pattern
was similar in models additionally adjusted for adult
social and cardiovascular risk factors. Applying IPWs
to account for missing observations changed the co-
efficient for elevated depressive symptoms from 1.47
to 1.50 (results not shown). HRs for depressive
symptoms and memory impairment were substan-
tially lower after adjusting for adult social, behav-
ioral, and clinical risk factors. However, effect
estimates for depressive symptoms were similar re-
gardless of whether memory impairment was in-
cluded or excluded from the models. Even in models
restricted to individuals with at least the median
memory score of 10, elevated depressive symptoms
predicted a 55% increased risk of incident stroke
(95% CI 1.29 to 1.85; results not shown in tables).
Elevated depressive symptoms were associated
with increased risk of incident stroke for men and
women above and below age 65 (table 3). Across
each age- and sex-stratified model examined, simul-
taneous adjustment for elevated depressive symp-
toms and impaired memory scores resulted in little
change in their respective HRs compared to models
in which their effects were estimated separately.
We conducted supplementary analyses to assess
whether results were sensitive to alternative modeling
decisions. Because depressive symptoms and memory
scores changed over successive interviews, we re-
peated the primary analyses using time-updated
values of depression and memory. Adjusting for
time-constant demographic covariates (as in the first
column of table 1), the separate coefficients were
1.60 (1.45 to 1.76) for elevated depressive symptoms
and 1.63 (1.47 to 1.81) for memory impairment.
Coefficients declined only slightly when simulta-
neously adjusted for elevated depressive symptoms
(HR 1.53; 1.39 to 1.69) and memory impairment
(HR 1.56; 1.40 to 1.73).
We also considered depressive symptoms as a con-
tinuous variable ranging from 0 to 8. Each 1-point
increase in baseline depressive symptoms was associ-
ated with an 8% increase in hazard of stroke inci-
dence (95% CI 1.05 to 1.11), in models adjusted for
core demographics and adult social conditions. After
adding continuous memory score and continuous
TICS score to this model to improve control of cog-

nitive impairment, the HR associated with each ad-
ditional point on the CES-D was nearly unchanged:
1.07 (1.05 to 1.10).
When adjusted only for demographic and adult
social risk factors, each of the 8 CES-D symptom
items individually predicted incident stroke (figure 2,
dark, left-hand columns for each symptom). Adjust-
ing for baseline memory impairment attenuated the
effect estimates very little (figure 2, gray, middle col-
umns). After adding all 8 items simultaneously to the
model, only 2 were significantly associated with
stroke: “everything was an effort” and “sleep was rest-
less” (figure 2, light right-hand columns). When this
analysis (including all 8 items) was repeated restrict-
ing to individuals with elevated baseline depressive
symptoms, “everything was an effort” (HR 1.26;
1.02 to 1.56) and “couldn’t get going” (HR 1.22;
1.05 to 1.47) remained significant, but “sleep was
restless” did not predict incident stroke (HR 0.96;
0.79 to 1.16) (results not shown).
DISCUSSION In a large national study with over 8
years of average follow-up, we found that elevated
depressive symptoms predicted stroke incidence in-
dependently of memory impairment. This result was
robust to several alternative model specifications and
evident in all population subsamples examined. This
suggests that depression is independently associated
with stroke rather than being only a sign of early
cerebrovascular disease.
These results are consistent with prior findings
from several studies showing that depressive symp-
toms or related affective phenotypes are important
risk factors for stroke incidence.7-10 Prior research
suggests that depressive symptoms as a continuous
phenotype may be more relevant for stroke, while
diagnosable depressive disorder may have a threshold
effect more strongly related to ischemic heart dis-
ease.7,33,34 Our data are not ideal to address this de-
bate because we have no direct diagnostic measures.
Our findings do suggest a continuous dose-response
relationship between level of depressive symptoms
and stroke risk.
Our analyses extend earlier results by examining
whether memory impairment and depressive symp-
toms predict stroke independently. We hypothesized
that if both risk factors were markers for a single
shared pathway to stroke, simultaneous adjustment
for both risk factors should substantially attenuate
their effects on the risk of stroke. In contrast, if de-
pressive symptoms influence stroke risk at least in
part via a pathway independent of cerebrovascular
disease, depressive symptoms should predict stroke
independently of memory impairment. We found
only a moderate correlation between depressive
symptoms and cognitive impairment. Thus, adjust-
ment for memory scores only slightly attenuated the
hazard ratio associated with elevated depressive
symptoms. The very small attenuation suggests that
the observed association between depressive symp-
toms and stroke might operate at least partially
through pathways that are independent of those ac-
counting for the association between memory im-
pairment and stroke. Future analyses including direct
neuroimaging indicators of cerebrovascular disease
and evaluating the relationship between new onset of
depressive symptoms or remission of depressive
symptoms and subsequent stroke would help assess
this hypothesis.
Pathways leading from depression to stroke might
involve mechanisms that “trigger” stroke (i.e., pre-
cipitate ischemic events), or exacerbate underlying
cerebrovascular disease. The inflammatory, hyperco-
agulable, and platelet-activating effects of depression
may all increase cardioembolic stroke risk.35-37 Less is
known about stroke triggers than about factors that
influence accumulating cerebrovascular pathology.38
Stroke triggers may include cardiovascular auto-

nomic dysregulation, manifested by elevated basal
catecholamine levels, hypertension, increased heart
rate responses to stressors, reduced heart rate variabil-
ity, and baroreceptor sensitivity. Depression may in-
fluence stroke risk via HPA axis disturbances or
amygdala modifications that compromise amygdalar
regulation of the HPA axis. However, whether these
HPA and amygdala disturbances are caused by de-
pression remains uncertain, with some evidence indi-
cating that HPA and amygdala functioning are
indicators of vulnerability to depression.21 For exam-
ple, feedback inhibition triggered by circulating glu-
cocorticoids appears reduced in depressed patients,21
but chronic stress and early life adversity have also
been linked to increased amygdala volume, possibly
leading to exaggerated anxiety responses and HPA
upregulation. HPA axis disturbances predict in-
creased circulating catecholamines, platelet activa-
tion, endothelial dysfunction, and reduced heart rate
variability, all of which may increase stroke risk.21-24
Autonomic dysfunction is associated with the devel-
opment and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF), a
major stroke risk factor.e8 Although depressive states
are clearly linked to ventricular arrhythmias and sud-
den cardiac death,e11 there has been little research on
the relationship between affective states and AF. The
limited available evidence suggests an association; for
example, depression predicts AF recurrence after car-
dioversion.e9 Tension and anger, emotional states
closely related to depression, predict AF incidence
among Framingham Heart Study men. We do not
have sufficient data to directly evaluate these hypoth-
eses, but such pathways are promising avenues for
future research.
In exploratory analyses, we found that the “rest-
less sleep” and “everything was an effort” symptoms
from the CES-D scale independently predicted inci-
dent stroke. When restricting to individuals with ele-
vated depressive symptoms, “restless sleep” was no
longer predictive, but “everything was an effort” and
“couldn’t get going” both predicted stroke. These find-
ings should be interpreted with caution, because en-
dorsement of a single-item assessment of a specific
symptom may reflect other physiologic or behavioral
issues besides manifestations of depression. Sleep may
influence stroke risk independently of other depressive
symptoms,39,40 but this association was not observed
among those with elevated depressive symptoms.

All models were adjusted for age at baseline (linear and quadratic), Hispanic ethnicity, black race, southern birth, mother’s
and father’s education 8 years, year of Health and Retirement Study enrollment, years of education, baseline income,
wealth, and marital status. Separate models included only a single CES-D item. Separate plus baseline memory impairment
models included that CES-D item plus an indicator for baseline memory impairment. The third set of models “modeled
together” included all 8 items from the CES-D in the same model, as well as baseline memory impairment.

The HRS oversampled black and Hispanic sub-
jects in the original design, so the sample is quite
diverse compared to many community-based studies.
Little is known about potentially heterogeneous ef-
fects of stroke risk factors in minority populations.e13
However, this dataset has several limitations; most
importantly, we have only brief assessments of de-
pressive symptoms and memory impairments which
probably imperfectly capture the underlying physio-
logic process. The measurement challenge is poten-
tially
exacerbated
in
socioeconomically
and
ethnically diverse samples. Measurement error in
memory scores is a particular concern. Extensive
measurement error in memory could result in the
spurious appearance of an independent relationship
between depressive symptoms and stroke even after
adjusting for memory. Reliance on past-week mea-
sures of depressive symptoms is another limitation;
findings may differ with longer-term symptom as-
sessments or lifetime diagnoses measures. Use of self-
or proxy-reported strokes is a limitation, although
our previous findings indicate that stroke assessments
in HRS perform well compared to data sets with
medical record verification.26 Approximately 15% of
the eligible sample was excluded from primary analy-
ses due to missing data on predictors, outcomes, or
key covariates. Although IPW analyses indicated re-
sults did not differ when analyzed accounting for
missing observations, this approach is only valid if
data are missing at random, conditional on measured
covariates.
Despite these limitations, these findings provide
evidence that depressive symptoms are associated
with an increased risk of stroke independently of
memory scores, possibly via mechanisms that trigger
or precipitate acute stroke.
