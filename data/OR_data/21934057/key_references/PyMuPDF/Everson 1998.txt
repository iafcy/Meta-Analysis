Depressive Symptoms and Increased Risk
of Stroke Mortality Over a 29-Year Period
Susan A. Everson, PhD, MPH; Robert E. Roberts, PhD; Debbie E. Goldberg, MS; George A. Kaplan, PhD
Background: Several lines of evidence indicate that de-
pression is importantly associated with cardiovascular dis-
ease end points. However, little is known about the role
of depression in stroke mortality.
Methods: This study examined the association between
depressive symptoms and stroke mortality in a prospec-
tive study of behavioral, social, and psychological factors
related to health and mortality in a community sample of
6676 initially stroke-free adults (45.8% male; 79.1% white;
mean age at baseline, 43.4 years) from Alameda County,
California. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the 18-
item Human Population Laboratory Depression Scale. Cox
proportionalhazardsregressionmodelswereusedtoevalu-
ate the impact of depressive symptoms after controlling for
age, sex, race, and other confounders.
Results: A total of 169 stroke deaths occurred during
29 years of follow-up. Reporting 5 or more depressive
symptoms at baseline was associated with increased risk
of stroke mortality, after adjusting for age, sex, and race
(hazard ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.39;
P,.006). This association remained significant after ad-
ditional adjustments for education, alcohol consump-
tion, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, and dia-
betes (hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-
2.22; P,.02). Time-dependent covariate models, which
allowed changes in reported depressive symptoms and
risk factor levels during follow-up, revealed the same pat-
tern of associations.
Conclusions: This population-based study provides the
strongest epidemiological evidence to date for a signifi-
cant relationship between depressive symptoms andstroke
mortality. These results contribute to the growing litera-
ture on the adverse health effects of depression.

R
ESEARCH HAS identified sev-
eral important risk factors
for stroke, including hyper-
tension, diabetes mellitus,
cigarette smoking, alcohol
abuse, high cholesterol levels, and obe-
sity1,2; however, little is known about the
potential role of psychosocial factors in
stroke incidence and mortality. This is sur-
prising because psychosocial factors have
been shown to be importantly related to
all-cause mortality, cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD) morbidity and mortality,
prevalence and progression of carotid ath-
erosclerosis, and acute myocardial infarc-
tion.3-10 In particular, convincing evi-
dence has accumulated in the past decade
identifying depression as a significant fac-
tor in CVD.5,7,11-17
Depression could contribute to stroke
risk or survival following a stroke through
a variety of mechanisms. Depression has
known neuroendocrine and immunologi-
cal effects,18,19 both of which could influ-
encestrokerisk.Moreover,depressionmay
negatively impact stroke risk factors. For
example, previous research has shown that
high levels of depressive symptoms are as-
sociated with decreased physical activity,
higher prevalence of smoking, and al-
tered lipid metabolism.13,20-23
In addition, several recent studies are
suggestive of this association. Among a
sample of 103 patients with stroke, a di-
agnosis of major or minor depression was
related to a 70% increased risk of mortal-
ity due to any cause over 10 years of follow-
up.24 Colantonio and colleagues25 re-
ported that higher scores on the Center for
Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D) were associated with increased
risk of incident stroke over 7 years of fol-
low-up among more than 2600 elderly
men and women from the Yale Health and
Aging Project, which was part of the Es-
tablished Populations for Epidemiologi-
cal Studies of the Elderly program. How-
ever, following multivariate adjustment for
known stroke risk factors, CES-D scores
were no longer significantly associated

with stroke incidence. In addition, the majority of par-
ticipants in that study had only a grade school educa-
tion and many had very limited incomes, making the gen-
eralizability of the findings somewhat limited.
Simonsick and colleagues26 used data from the 3
study sites from the Established Populations for Epide-
miological Studies of the Elderly to assess the relation-
ship between symptoms of depression and hypertension-
related morbidity and mortality among a sample of older
adults diagnosed as having hypertension. In general, they
found that hypertensive men and women who reported
high levels of depressive symptoms were more than twice
as likely to experience a stroke during the subsequent 3
to 6 years than their hypertensive, nondepressed coun-
terparts. However, results were not consistent across study
sites, and because of the design of that study, there was
no way of determining whether the depressive symp-
toms were a cause or a consequence of the complica-
tions of hypertension.
Also, it was recently reported that an increase in
CES-D scores over a period of 41⁄2 years was associated
with excess risk of mortality, stroke, and myocardial in-
farction in more than 4300 participants from the Sys-
tolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program.27 These find-
ings were upheld after adjustments for age, race, sex,
disease history, and smoking status, and the increase in
depressive symptoms was a stronger risk factor for women
than for men. Baseline levels of depressive symptoms were
not related to cardiovascular events, however, and the
authors noted that causal pathways could not be in-
ferred from their data, in part because all participants had
isolated systolic hypertension and it is plausible that pre-
monitory symptoms of CVD contributed to increased
depressive symptoms prior to a clinical event.
The present study examined the association be-
tween self-reported depressive symptoms and stroke mor-
tality over a 29-year period in a community sample of
6676 men and women. The analyses reported are from
METHODS
THE ALAMEDA COUNTY STUDY
The Alameda County Study is an ongoing longitudinal
study of the role of various behavioral, psychological,
social, and demographic factors in health and mortality
among a community sample of men and women. The
study began in 1965 and used a stratified random house-
hold sampling procedure to recruit a representative
sample of the adult, noninstitutionalized population of
Alameda County, California. A total of 6928 adults (86%
of those eligible), ages 16 to 94 years, provided baseline
information by written questionnaires on health history
and status, health habits, psychological feelings and atti-
tudes, marital history and status, childbearing practices,
civic, social, and recreational activities, occupational his-
tory and status, life history during childhood and adoles-
cence, and standard demographic variables. Subjects were
tracked regardless of location or disability status and sur-
vivors were asked to complete questionnaires again in
1974, 1983 (50% sample), 1994, and 1995, with response
rates between 85% and 97%. For the present study, only
data from the 1965, 1974, and 1983 surveys were used.
Questionnaires were similar in style and response for-
mat, and every effort was made to keep the wording of
items and the length of the questionnaires consistent
across all waves of data collection. Participants were
requested to complete the questionnaires on their own,
ie, “proxy” respondents were not used. After initial
recruitment and determination of eligibility, question-
naires were sent to and returned from participants by
mail. Detailed design and sampling procedures for this
study have been reported previously.28,29 The research
protocol was approved by the California Health and
Welfare Agency Committee for the Protection of Human
Subjects and conducted in accordance with their guide-
lines regarding informed consent for participation in
research in which the sole form of data collection is via
mailed surveys.
STUDY POPULATION
All participants who were interviewed in 1965, had com-
plete data on the measure of depression and all covariates,
and did not have a history of stroke were included in the
present study. Of the 6867 persons eligible, 46 were ex-
cluded because of incomplete or missing data on the de-
pression scale and 145 were excluded because of missing
data on covariates, leaving a total of 6676 subjects for the
present analyses. Nonparticipants were older, had fewer
years of education, were more likely to have a history of
diabetes or hypertension but were less likely to be current
smokers and more likely to be nondrinkers than partici-
pants (P,.01).
HUMAN POPULATION LABORATORY
DEPRESSION SCALE
Depressive symptoms were measured by the Human
Population Laboratory (HPL) Depression Scale, an 18-
item scale developed by Roberts and colleagues30-32 that
assesses mood disturbances, negative self-concept, loss of
energy, problems with eating and sleeping, and psycho-
motor retardation or agitation. Scores are calculated by
assigning 1 point for each “true” or “false” answer that
corresponds to a depressed response. Item-total correla-
tions for the depression scale range from 0.18 to 0.45 with
Cronbach a of 0.77, indicating good internal consistency.
A symptom score of 5 or higher is considered indicative
of depression or mood disturbance, albeit not necessarily
clinical depression. The symptoms do not fully operation-
alize Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Revised Third Edition (DSM-III-R)33 criteria for a major
depressive episode. However, the cutoff of 5 or more
symptoms to define caseness has been used in numerous
analyses to indicate significant symptomatology, has dem-
onstrated reliability and validity,30-32 is conceptually simi-
lar to other brief symptom checklists such as the CES-D
scale, and an earlier study found that it correlated well
with the Beck Depression Inventory (r=0.66) in an outpa-
tient clinical population.31

the Alameda County Study in which data on depressive
symptoms and other risk factors were obtained on mul-
tiple occasions between 1965 and 1994. Using informa-
tion from repeated assessments of these variables en-
abled us to more rigorously examine the relationship
between depression and stroke mortality, which could
be expected to vary with changes in risk factors over time.
RESULTS
SUBJECT CHARACTERISTICS
At baseline, participants ranged in age from 17 to 94 years
(mean, 43.4; SD, 15.9), 45.8% were male, and 79.1% were
white. Most (65%) participants had completed 12 or more
years of school, although nearly 18% reported less than
9 years of formal education. Approximately 14.5% of par-
ticipants reported consuming more than 45 alcoholic
drinks per month (coded by the quantity and frequency
of beer, wine, and liquor intake), 63.5% reported more
moderate alcohol consumption (,45 drinks in a month),
and 22% were abstainers. At baseline, 39.7% of subjects
were never smokers, 15.7% were former smokers, and
44.6% were current smokers. A total of 677 (10.1%) par-
ticipants reported a history of hypertension, and 143
(2.1%) reported a history of diabetes. Mean body mass
index was 23.8 kg/m2.
DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, RISK FACTORS,
AND STROKE MORTALITY
A total of 969 subjects (14.5%) reported 5 or more de-
pressive symptoms at baseline. As shown in Table 1,
these subjects were older, less likely to be male or white,
less likely to have at least 12 years of education, more
likely to be abstainers and current smokers, and more
likely to have prevalent hypertension and prevalent dia-
betes than those who were not depressed at baseline
STROKE MORTALITY
Mortality tapes from California were searched annually for
information on study participants. Out-of-state deaths were
ascertained during follow-up contact, in which death cer-
tificates were requested from the state of residence. Death
certificates were used to verify cause of death. Stroke mor-
tality was based on International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision (ICD-9)34 codes 400 to 436.
COVARIATES
Risk factors, assessed at each wave of data collection, in-
cluded education, assessed as years of school completed;
alcohol consumption, assessed as number of drinks per
month and summed for individual report of beer, wine, and
liquor consumption; body mass index, calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared; smok-
ing; and self-report of hypertension and diabetes.
Covariates were modeled as follows: education was
coded as less than vs equal to or greater than 12 years of
education; alcohol consumption was categorized as heavy
(.45 drinks per month) or none, with moderate consump-
tion (1-45 drinks per month) as the reference category; body
mass index was modeled continuously; smoking was coded
as pack-years of smoking; hypertension and diabetes his-
tory were dichotomized in response to the question, “Have
you ever seen a medical doctor for (condition)?”
DATA ANALYSES
The relationship between self-reported depressive symp-
toms and mortality due to stroke was examined using Cox
proportional hazards models,35 with and without time-
dependent covariates. All assumptions for the Cox mod-
els were tested and met. Deaths were included through 1994.
Subjects known to have died of stroke and not lost to fol-
low-up were kept in the analysis until the year of their death.
Subjects not known to have died and who were available
for follow-up were given a survival time of 29 years. Sub-
jects unavailable for follow-up in either the 1974 or 1983
surveys were censored on the survey date when unavail-
ability for follow-up occurred. Subjects who died of causes
other than stroke were censored in the year of their death.
Statistical analyseswereperformedusing commercially avail-
able software (PROC PHREG in SAS, version 6.0936) in-
stalled on a Sun SPARCstation 20 (Sun Microsystems Com-
puter Corporation, Mountain View, Calif).
Two types of models were calculated. In the first type,
the initial model examined the crude relationship be-
tween depressive symptoms reported at baseline and sub-
sequent stroke mortality. Initial analyses modeled depres-
sion continuously. However, because our prior use of the
HPL Depression Scale indicated that a cutoff of 5 symp-
toms was indicative of significant symptomatology, 30-32
subsequent analyses contrasted subjects with 5 or more
depressive symptoms and those with fewer than 5 symp-
toms. Covariate adjustments for age, sex, and race (white or
nonwhite) were then added. A third Cox model was then
calculated that also included covariates representing the
1965 values of education, alcohol consumption, smoking,
body mass index, and history of hypertension and diabetes.
The second type of model used consisted of time-
dependentcovariatemodels,whichwerecalculatedtodeter-
mine if changes in depressive symptoms and changes in risk
factorlevelsduringfollow-upinfluencedtheassociationbe-
tween depression and stroke mortality. In these analyses, all
variablesexceptage,sex,andracewereallowedtochangebased
on data from the additional survey periods. For example, a
participant who reported that he or she drank 20 drinks per
monthin1965butwhosealcoholconsumptionhadincreased
to more than 50 drinks per month in 1974 would be scored
as a “moderate drinker” from 1965 to 1973, and as a “heavy
drinker” from 1974 until date of censor or death or until his
or her reported average alcohol consumption changed in a
subsequentsurvey.Our1983surveywasconductedona50%

whomwehaddatain1965and1974.Consequently,68stroke
deaths were counted as “censored” observations owing to
missing data in the time-dependent covariate models, leav-
ing a total of 101 fatal stroke cases in these analyses.

(P,.05). In addition, among those who were current
smokers at the time of the baseline survey, the de-
pressed group had more pack-years of smoking than the
nondepressed group (P,.03). Depressed and nonde-
pressed groups did not differ in body mass index or preva-
lence of heavy drinking.
One hundred sixty-nine stroke deaths occurred dur-
ing follow-up, 39 of which occurred among participants
reporting 5 or more symptoms of depression (4.0%) and
130 of which occurred among the nondepressed group
(2.3%). The Figure illustrates the Kaplan-Meier cumu-
lative survival curves for the depressed and nonde-
pressed groups. The unadjusted Cox model hazard ra-
tio associated with having 5 or more depressive symptoms
was 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-2.78;
P,.001).
Table 2, top, presents the unadjusted results from
the analysis with depressive symptoms modeled con-
tinuously and the findings from the models with depres-
sion modeled categorically, with added covariates. Each
1-point increase on the HPL Depression Scale was asso-
ciated with more than an 8% increase in risk of death from
stroke (P,.003). With depressive symptoms modeled cat-
egorically, the risk associated with reporting 5 or more
depressive symptoms was 1.66 (P,.006), after adjust-
ments for age, sex, and race. In the model that included
additional adjustments for baseline values of education,
alcohol consumption, smoking, hypertension, diabetes,
and body mass index, having 5 or more depressive symp-
toms was associated with a 54% increased risk of stroke
mortality (P,.02).
The time-dependent covariate models, shown in
Table 2, bottom, revealed a similar, albeit slightly weaker,
pattern of associations. The initial model, with scores on
the measure of depression modeled continuously and al-
lowed to vary with each wave of data collection and age,
sex, and race held constant, revealed a 6% increase in risk
of stroke mortality with each 1-point increase in depres-
sion (P,.10). In the categorical model, with age, sex, and
race held constant and number of times 5 or more de-
pressive symptoms were reported in the successive waves
of data collection allowed to change, self-report of 5 or
more depressive symptoms was associated with a 56%
increased risk of stroke mortality (P,.06). The eleva-
tion in risk associated with a high level of depressive symp-
toms was essentially unchanged in the fully adjusted
model in which covariates for all risk factors were al-
lowed to vary according to participants’ reported values

in 1965, 1974, and 1983. Clearly, the point estimates for
these models were similar to those with the baseline co-
variates, although the statistical significance was dimin-
ished slightly because of the fewer number of fatal strokes
included in the analyses.
EFFECT OF PREVALENT CVD
Because rates of depressive syndromes are known to be
elevated among individuals with CVD,11,13-15 we recalcu-
lated the Cox model examining the relationship be-
tween baseline level of depressive symptoms and subse-
quent stroke mortality, excluding 259 participants
(including 11 cases of fatal stroke) who reported a his-
tory of heart disease in 1965. Results were unchanged
from the original model. Each 1-point increase in de-
pression was associated with an 8% increase in risk of
stroke mortality (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.15;
P,.006); and persons reporting 5 or more depressive
symptoms at baseline had 70% excess risk of stroke mor-
tality, after adjustment for age, sex, and race (hazard ra-
tio, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.15-2.50; P,.007). Additional ad-
justments for education, alcohol consumption, body mass
index, smoking status, diabetes, and hypertension had
little effect on this relationship (hazard ratio, 1.57; 95%
CI, 1.06-2.32; P,.03).
EFFECT OF EARLY DEATHS
Because symptoms of depression may be a response to
illness and we wanted to exclude individuals who may
have been sick at the beginning of the study, baseline co-
variate analyses were then repeated eliminating the par-
ticipants who died during the first 3 years of the study
of stroke (n=14) or any other cause (n=231). Again, each
1-point increase on the measure of depression was as-
sociated with nearly an 8% increase in risk of stroke mor-
tality in the initial model (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-
1.14; P,.01). Similarly, the categorical models showed
that individuals with 5 or more depressive symptoms at
baseline were at 1.67-fold increased risk of subsequent
mortality due to stroke (95% CI, 1.14-2.45; P,.008),
which remained significantly elevated after adjustment
for all risk factors (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95%CI, 1.04-
2.26; P,.03).
COMMENT
This population-based study provides, to our knowl-
edge, the best epidemiological evidence to date for a sig-
nificant, positive relationship between depressive symp-
toms and stroke mortality. After adjustment for established
stroke risk factors, individuals reporting 5 or more symp-
toms of depression at baseline experienced more than 50%
excess risk of mortality due to stroke during the subse-
quent 29 years. This level of risk was unchanged after
taking into account changes in reported depressive symp-
toms and risk factor levels during follow-up. Moreover,
these relationships were upheld in models that ex-
cluded early deaths and individuals with prevalent CVD
at baseline. The consistency of the association between
depressive symptoms and stroke mortality is high-
lighted by the relatively unchanged effect sizes we ob-
served in our various statistical models.
The mechanisms by which depression may in-
crease stroke risk remain to be determined. Our data show
that behavioral factors do not explain the association be-
tween depression and stroke mortality. For example, al-
though participants with 5 or more symptoms of depres-
sion were more likely to smoke and to have more pack-
years of smoking than those who were not depressed
(Table 1), smoking did not significantly affect the ob-
served association. Similarly, preexisting hypertension or
diabetes accounted only for a small portion of the rela-
tionship. Our measures of hypertension and diabetes were
by self-report only, which may not be as sensitive as other
measures of disease, eg, medication review or physician
report; however, these risk factors were significant or mar-
ginally significant (P,.20) covariates in our models. Thus,
although our self-report measures were not ideal, they
were reliable indicators of these risk factors and impor-
tant covariates in our models.
Other risk factors, unavailable to us, also should
be considered. For example, associations between de-
pression or other affective states and lipid levels or me-
tabolism, while somewhat conflicting, have been re-
ported13,37-39 and it will be important for future research
to examine these potential pathways. New evidence in-
dicates that platelet calcium (Ca++) responsivity to se-
rotonin is heightened in depressed patients,40 suggest-
ing that platelet activation could also be an important
factor in the relationship between depression and stroke
mortality. In addition, depression may increase stroke
mortality through immunological or neuroendocrine
mechanisms. The present study did not have the data to
examine these hypotheses, although other studies are sug-
gestive.18,19,41,42
Nearly 15% of participants in this study reported 5
or more symptoms of depression at baseline. Our mea-
sure of depression estimates the point prevalence of de-
pressive symptoms but our rates do not reflect the preva-
lence of clinical depression. This measure includes many
(but not all) symptom criteria for major depression from
the DSM-III-R. Because our data are self-report, we were
not able to use DSM-III-R exclusionary criteria; there-
fore, our prevalence rates are higher than would be the
case if clinical diagnoses had been made on the basis of
structured psychiatric interviews. However, available data
(not shown) from our 1994 survey, which included a mea-
sure with full coverage of DSM-III-R symptom criteria as
well as the HPL Depression Scale, indicate that 65% of
those with 5 or more symptoms on the HPL Depression
Scale also met the criteria for major depressive episode
according to DSM-III-R criteria. Also, as noted else-
where,32,43,44 the 2 different measurement strategies as-
sess somewhat different domains of depressive experi-
ence. Clinical depression can be a serious, debilitating
chronic disease; however, the presence of many symp-
toms of depression can also involve considerable impair-
ment and negative sequelae. Thus, our symptom-based
measure may underestimate the effect of depression on
risk of stroke.
Some limitations to our study should be noted. We

were unable to examine the relation between depres-
sion and incident stroke among our participants. Such
data would provide valuable information and greater un-
derstanding of the role of depression in stroke risk. We
also did not have data on the types of stroke partici-
pants suffered. It would be interesting to determine if de-
pression had more or less impact on hemorrhagic vs is-
chemic stroke. Such information may provide clues to
the mechanisms underlying the association. Also, we had
too few stroke deaths among women to reliably investi-
gate sex differences in the association between depres-
sion and stroke mortality. Given that women have higher
rates of depression,45 and that stroke accounts for a greater
proportion of overall deaths among women than among
men,46 it is critical that this issue be addressed.
In sum, the present study provides compelling evi-
dence that depressive symptoms are a significant factor
in subsequent stroke mortality in a representative adult
sample. These results contribute to the growing litera-
ture on the adverse health effects of depression. Given
the high lifetime prevalence rates of depression in the
United States for men (2.8/100) and women (7.4/100),47
and the convincing evidence that depression has a strong
negative impact on physical health, in addition to its dev-
astating mental health consequences, it is imperative that
symptoms of depression be recognized and appropriately
treated.
