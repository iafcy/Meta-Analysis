Depression: A 15-Year Prospective Study of a Japanese
Community Sample, the Matsunoyama-Niigata Suicide
Prevention Project

Objective: To compare long-term survival rates and causes of death in community-dwelling elderly with and without
depression using the International Research Diagnostic Criteria administered by a psychiatrist.
Method: From 1985 to 2000, we prospectively examined Japanese persons (N 5 920) aged 65 years or older. Cases with
depression (n 5 158) and a control sample without depression (N 5 762) were evaluated. The main outcome variables
were survival rates and causes of mortality.
Results: By 2000, 61% of the subjects with depression had died. By contrast, 48% had died in the control group at the
completion of the 15-year follow-up. Using age-adjusted Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we found a hazard ratio (HR) of
1.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–1.89) for mortality in the depressed group compared with controls (p 5 .0009).
Importantly, in female subjects with depression, the HR was 1.55 (95% CI 1.16–2.07; p 5 .002). In males with depression,
by contrast, the HR (1.34) was not significant (95% CI 0.84–2.13; p 5 .19). Significantly more subjects died of
cerebrovascular disorders, malignant tumors, respiratory disorders, or suicide after the onset of depression compared
with controls (p , .05).
Conclusions: Depression appears to be associated with a significant increase in the risk of mortality among elderly
Japanese subjects, particularly in females. The elderly with a diagnosis of depression may be at an elevated risk of
mortality owing to cerebrovascular disorder, malignant tumors, respiratory disorders, or suicide. These prospective data
provide a new quantitative insight on gender differences and the long-term public health significance of depression
among the community-dwelling elderly.

The lifetime prevalence of major
depressive
disorder as diagnosed with the fourth edition of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is 5
to 12% in males and 10 to 25% in females.1 According
to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression
is ranked fourth with regard to the influence on overall
health, followed by respiratory infectious disease,
diarrheal disorder, and perinatal disorder, based on
the disability-adjusted life-years.2 Further, depression is
predicted to rank second by 2020. Thus, depression
may come to affect one in six to seven individuals in
their lifetime and have a prominent influence in both
the social and physical dimensions of health.
Several reports in the past have suggested that
depression may decrease survival.3–6 For example,

patients with heart disease,7–9 cerebrovascular disor-
der,10–13 and malignant tumors14 may have depression,
which can influence their survival.8,15–20 It has also
been reported that individuals with depression are
likely to develop various physical disorders later (eg,
heart disease,17 cerebrovascular disorder,18 malignant
tumors19). Notably, depression may affect causes of
death not only directly but also indirectly, through
increases in cigarette smoking20 and alcohol consump-
tion,21 nonadherence to therapy,22 or impaired social
integration.23
Despite the results of singular clinical epidemio-
logic studies suggesting a link between depression and
mortality, the available body of literature does not
uniformly support this association. Wulsin and collea-
gues reviewed 57 reports on survival of depressive
patients and found that about half (51%) of the studies
reported
significantly
decreased
survival
rates
in
depressed patients, 23% reported the absence of an
association, and 26% were inconclusive.24 Some, but
not all, studies suggest that depression may increase the
risk of death by cardiovascular disease, particularly in
men.24 Thus, no consistent conclusion concerning the
survival rates of depressed patients or the attendant
causes of mortality has been clearly established to date.
We noted that the elderly suffer from a high
prevalence of depression.25 This predicament is further
accentuated owing to the increasing size of the elderly
population globally. In Japan, for example, those aged
65 years or older may account for 26% of the total
Japanese population by 2015, becoming the world’s
most rapidly aging society.26 Hence, studies in the
Japanese elderly population may serve as a model to
study the long-term medical outcomes associated with
depression.
The aim of the present study was to prospectively
investigate, over a course of 15 years, the survival rates
and causes of death in community-dwelling elderly
Japanese residents who were diagnosed with depression
based on established international research diagnostic
criteria administered by a qualified psychiatrist.
Methods
Subjects
The subjects were male and female residents aged
65 years and older as of July 1985 in Matsunoyama
town, Higashikubiki county, Niigata prefecture (total
population in 1985: 4,400; elderly rate: 21%). There
were 369 males (65–91 years of age; 73.6 6 5.9 years)
(mean 6 SD) and 551 females (65–96 years of age;
74.3 6 6.7 years), a total of 920 subjects. The survey
period was between 1985 and 2000. This survey was
performed as the Matsunoyama Suicide Prevention
Project,27 and it is still continuing. Written and
informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Study Procedures and Data Collection
The following tests were performed annually in
July as a geriatric depression screening test: Zung’s
Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS)28 in 1985 and a
modified SDS, the Niigata University Self Rating
Depression Scale (NSDS),29,30 after 1986. NSDS was
established and validated by slight modification of the
SDS: 5 items were added (25 items in total) to the
questions of SDS, and the maximum score was set at
100, to facilitate the interpretation of rating scores.29,30
The questions were structured to be as comprehensible
as possible for the Japanese elderly to answer the
contents of the questions appropriately. NSDS is
commonly used to screen for depression in Japanese
patients.29,30 When the SDS score rate was 60% or
higher or the NSDS score was 60 points or higher, the
subject was interviewed by a psychiatrist to establish
the diagnosis. These threshold values are recom-
mended for screening of subjects for further clinical
interview by a psychiatrist.29 Subjects whose scores did
not meet the criterion above (ie, 60% score rate) were
also interviewed if they expressed suicidal intent to a
physician (internist) of a regional medical institution or
a public health nurse or had experienced the death of
their spouse, discharge from a medical institution, or a
suicide incident in their neighborhood immediately
prior to their annual study visit.
As part of the diagnostic procedure, whether the
depression met the diagnostic criteria of major or
minor depressive disorder was evaluated using the
Research Diagnostic Criteria.31 The subjects diagnosed
with major and minor depressive disorders were
collectively designated as the depressive group, and
the other subjects were designated as the nondepressive
group. When a subject in the nondepressive group was
later diagnosed with major or minor depressive
disorder on diagnostic interview, the subject was
transferred to the depressive group in that year. That
is, if subjects were not depressed at study entry, they
were in the nondepressed group unless they later
developed depression. For all subjects diagnosed with
depression, pharmacologic treatments were immedi-
ately initiated at a medical office or a psychiatric
hospital with a hospitalization facility.
Assessment of the Survival Rate
The behavioral rating scores for depression, the
presence or absence of depression in subjects inter-
viewed for diagnosis, and the study outcomes, such as

death and moving to another geographic area, were
investigated for individual subjects on an annual basis.
When survival could not be confirmed, the study
outcomes were ascertained by the Basic Resident
Register. When the registration was not kept, permis-
sion to read the death certificate kept at medical offices
in the town was obtained. The subjects who were
hospitalized or admitted to a facility at the time of
distribution of the questionnaire were regarded as
having moved out. Among the subjects who moved
out, subjects who reparticipated in the survey later
were handled as survivors, whereas those who did not
reparticipate remained in the ‘moved out’ category.
In the nondepressive group, the ratio of survivors
was calculated by dividing the annual number of
surviving subjects by the total number of surviving and
deceased subjects in the fiscal year (July to June). In the
depressive group, the number of surviving subjects was
divided by the total number of surviving and deceased
subjects in each follow-up year, designating the year of
discovery of depression as the ‘0’ year of follow-up.
The survival rates were also calculated separately
in males and females in both depressive and non-
depressive groups. The ratio of subjects younger than
69 years of age was particularly higher in the
nondepressive group than in the depressive group,
whereas the mean age was higher in the depressive
group (Table 1). To eliminate the effect of different
age distribution in the nondepressed group, represen-
tative samples were drawn from each age group of the
nondepressive group using random numbers. The ratio
of the subjects 85 years or older was higher in the
depressive group; thus, samples of this age group were
drawn from
the depressive group
by the same
procedure using random numbers. As a result, 153
and 382 (n 5 535) subjects in total were respectively
drawn from the depressive and nondepressive groups;
these two age-adjusted groups showed no significant
difference in age distribution (p . .05). For example,
in females, the mean age in the first year was 76.9 6
6.1 (SD) and 77.0 6 6.4 years in the depressive and
nondepressive groups, respectively (p . .05). This age-
adjusted sample of subjects was then used in the
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, including the attendant
gender-stratified analysis.
Assessment of Cause of Death
The causes of death were ascertained from the
Resident Population Dynamics Questionnaire or death
certificates and classified as heart disease, malignant
tumor, cerebrovascular disorder, respiratory disorder,
suicide, and others using the WHO International
Classification of Diseases.32 The mortality rates from each
cause in the age-adjusted depressive and nondepressive
groups and relative risk (RR) of death of the depressive
group compared with the nondepressive group for all
subjects, males and females, were calculated.
Statistical Analysis
The significance of differences in the survival rate
between patients with depression (n 5 153) and the
control group without depression (n 5 382) was
evaluated
by
the
Kaplan-Meier
survival
analysis,
including
the
attendant
gender-stratified
survival
analysis. SPSS (version 11.0J, SPSS Inc., Tokyo) was
used for all statistical analyses.
Results
The subject characteristics are shown in Table 1.
There were 158 depressed patients (17.2%) for all 15
years (see Table 1). The mean age at onset for
depression was 77.4 6 6.3 (SD) years. Fifty-five
(34.8%) and 167 (21.9%) subjects moved out of the
region in the depressed and control groups, respec-
tively. Matsunoyama is geographically located in rural
Japan. For the elderly residents, it is not uncommon to
relocate to a larger metropolitan district (eg, Niigata)
for familial reasons (eg, for close proximity with
younger family members). The duration of follow-up
was 5.8 6 4.6 years (mean 6 SD; range 1–15 years) in
the group with depression and 8.5 6 5.1 years (range
1–15 years) in the control group. In the entire study

sample (N 5 920), by 2000, 96 and 365 subjects were
ascertained to have died, whereas 8 and 7 subjects had
committed suicide in the depressed and control groups,
respectively (see Table 1). As a caveat, it is noteworthy
that patients who committed suicide in the nonde-
pressed (control) group might have had depression
between the annual study assessments.
Survival Rates in the Depressive and Nondepressive
Groups
From 1985 to 2000, there were 153 depressed and
382 nondepressed controls (n 5 535). From this age-
adjusted sample, by 2000, the number of surviving
subjects in depressed and nondepressed groups was 7
and 86, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
(males and females combined) found a hazard ratio of
1.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–1.89) for
mortality in the age-adjusted depressed group com-
pared with controls without depression (p 5 .0009).
Importantly, in female subjects with depression,
the hazard ratio for mortality was 1.55 (95% CI 1.16–
2.07; p 5 .002) (Figure 1B). In males with depression,
by contrast, the hazard ratio for mortality (1.34) was
not significant (95% CI 0.84–2.13; p 5 .19) (Figure
1A).
Hazard ratios for mortality in depressed subjects
aged 65 to 74 and . 74 years were 1.84 (95% CI 1.08–
3.12, p 5 .02) and 1.54 (95% CI 1.16–2.04; p 5
.0013), respectively (Figure 2).
Causes of Death
Table 2 shows the mortality rates from each cause
of death in the depressive and nondepressive groups and
RR of the depressive group. Using the age-adjusted
sample of depressed and control subjects without
depression,
we
found
a
significant
difference
in
mortality rates, particularly from cerebrovascular dis-
orders, as well as from malignant tumors, respiratory
disorders, and suicide in the depressive group (p , .05).
Discussion
There have been limited long-term observa-
tional studies of major depression and mortality in
community-dwelling elderly.33–39 Previous studies in
the field tended to have relatively shorter survey
periods (eg, as short as 6 months) and a smaller number
of study subjects, included an ethnically heterogeneous
group of patients, lacked a control group in some
reports, and focused solely on inpatients, or the
diagnosis
of
depression
was
made
based
on
a
questionnaire instead of a clinical interview by a
psychiatrist.24 In the present investigation, we pro-
spectively followed all elderly residents aged 65 years or
older in Matsunoyama town, Higashikubiki county,
Niigata prefecture for 15 years, identified a sample of
individuals who presented with depression (at least once
during the 15-year observation period) among these
subjects, and investigated the age-adjusted survival rate
and causes of death in the elderly with depression. Three
principal observations were made in our study.
First, the survival rate was significantly lower in
the depressive group than in the nondepressive group
throughout the 15-year prospective long-term follow-
up. Second, and importantly, the survival rate was
significantly lower in elderly females with depression
compared with female controls without depression. By
contrast, males with depression did not exhibit a
significantly increased hazard ratio for mortality. Third,
regarding the cause of death, the mortality rates from
cerebrovascular disorders, malignant tumors, respira-
tory disorders, and suicide were significantly higher in
the depressive group than in the nondepressive group.
Collectively, these prospective long-term observations

provide a new quantitative perspective on gender
differences and the public health significance of
depression in the community-dwelling elderly.
Notably, only six previous reports have investi-
gated gender differences in survival among patients
with depression. Among these, two reports were
consistent with our study,40,41 suggesting a greater
reduction in survival rate among female patients with
depression than males. Conversely, the other four
studies reported a significant decrease in the survival
rate,
particularly
among
the
male
depressive
patients.35,39,42,43 However, depression diagnosis in
these studies tended to be established by a question-
naire rather than a psychiatrist using research diagnostic
criteria.
If our results are representative of the population
as a whole, a question remains: Why was the death rate
higher in female depressive patients than in male
depressive patients? Murphy and colleagues suggested
that physical comorbidity might have been more
advanced in females even though the degree of
depression was similar following diagnosis using a
questionnaire.44 The latter assumption, however, is not
supported by the longer average life expectancy in
females than in males. Thus, the answer to the above
question is not clear at present, but the mortality rate
from cerebrovascular disorders was higher in females
than in males in our study, suggesting that depression
in elderly females may tend to be cerebrovascular; fatal
cerebrovascular disorders may occur in the course of
depression, or depression may induce cerebrovascular
disorder in ways that are not fully elucidated at present.
Few previous long-term studies investigated the
age group of 75 years or older. In a sample of 500
elderly community residents aged 85 years or older in
England, Vinkers and colleagues found that depression
was associated with a decrease in the survival rate even
in very elderly subjects (mean follow-up duration 3.2
years).45 On the other hand, Vinkers and colleagues
employed a questionnaire for the diagnosis of depres-
sion. In a self-rating questionnaire, subjects may
mistake, for instance, malaise associated with physical
disorders and physical complaints for symptoms of
depression. Thus, the depressive group in their study
might have included subjects with physical disorders,
or it might have been related to the difference in the
average life expectancy between Japan and England.
We found that the mortality rates from cerebro-
vascular disorders, malignant tumors, respiratory dis-
orders, and suicide were significantly higher in the
group with depression compared with controls. These
observations
require
further
validation
in
future
prospective studies. Association with mortality from
cerebrovascular disorders was apparent in the depressed
group as early as within the first 5 years. Major
depression can precipitate certain risk factors associated
with
cerebral
infarction,
including
hypertension,
hyperlipidemia,
diabetes,
and
smoking.
Cerebral
infarction resulting from increased platelet activity
owing to an overactive adrenocortical system has also
been reported.46 Cerebral lesions were localized in the
deep
white
matter
in
elderly
depressed
patients
compared
with
nondepressed
control
patients.47
Thus, a depressive state and cerebrovascular disorders
are presumably closely related, and their coexistence is
thus likely to increase the risk of mortality.
Association of the depressive group with suicide
was significant and consistent with other reports in the
elderly persons in the community.42 Depression is a
direct cause of suicide, and attention should be paid to
depression cases in this regard as well. In the present
prospective study, of the eight subjects who committed
suicide after the onset of depression, four (50%)

Survival Rate and Causes of Mortality in the Elderly with Depression/Kawamura et al
111

Downloaded from 

committed suicide within 1 year, and seven subjects
(87.5%) committed suicide within 2 years. These
observations corroborate earlier associations between
depression and suicide in older individuals.48
As a limitation of our study, we caution the reader
from drawing direct causal links between depression
and increased risk of mortality because some of the
potential confounding factors, such as physical comor-
bidity and concomitant medications at the time of the
survey, smoking habits and alcohol consumption,
access to health insurance, or socioeconomic condi-
tions, were not characterized in our study. After
detailed review of the medical literature, however, we
were struck by the paucity of prospective and long-
term outcome studies on major depression (particularly
as determined by a psychiatrist using research diag-
nostic criteria) in relation to mortality and the
influence of gender on longitudinal mortality rates in
the elderly. Hence, our study was designed to balance
these
considerations
to
account
for
all
possible
confounders against the feasibility of, and the need
for, long-term prospective evaluations of mortality in
community-dwelling older persons with depression.
Disease outcome studies often reach different
conclusions owing to heterogeneity in age and gender
distribution in study samples, discrepancies in establish-
ing the diagnosis for depression by research staff,
uneven delivery of health care services, or inadequate
access to treatment, particularly in countries where
medical insurance is privatized. Interethnic and cross-
cultural differences in lifestyle factors or environmental
factors may further confound clinical outcome studies
in
ethnically
diverse
populations.
However,
Matsunoyama town is located in a stable socio-
economic setting, and all residents have a Japanese
ethnic background and uniform lifestyle preferences
(eg, reliance on a traditional Japanese diet enriched
with seafood). Importantly, the national social welfare
services in Japan ensure that all residents have access to
health insurance and medical treatment for physical
and psychiatric comorbidity. For example, all patients
in the present study had access to antidepressant
pharmacotherapy promptly after the diagnosis of
depression was established. These considerations and
our analysis of the survival data after stratification by
gender and accounting for deaths owing to suicide
reduce the risk of confounding by patient-to-patient
heterogeneity in ethnic background, gender or age
distribution, access to health care services, medical
insurance, or antidepressant treatment in the study
sample.
Monitoring medical conditions comorbid with
depression is important to discern the causal link
between depression and mortality and for differentia-
tion of ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ relationships. For example,
cardiovascular disease may first present as new-onset
depression in the elderly, that is, cardiovascular disease
may
cause
depression
rather
than
vice
versa.49
However, this is a formidable challenge, especially in
long-term prospective studies in which patients tend to
agree with a more limited clinical assessment battery in
exchange for an increased cooperation for long-term
follow-up of their health. The shifting emphasis in
health care policies toward establishment of large
population biobanks (eg, UK Biobank, the Estonian
Genome Project, GenomEUtwin, the CARTAGENE
in Quebec) and prospective assembly of patient
phenotypic data in these and similar biobanks may
allow an integrated study of depression and other risk
factors in relation to long-term survival rates in the
near future.50–52
In summary, these prospective data from the
Matsunoyama-Niigata Suicide Prevention Project over
a period of 15 years collectively suggest that depression
is likely associated with a significant decrease in the
survival rates of the Japanese elderly subjects, particu-
larly in females. The survival rate was also lower when
the subjects who committed suicide were excluded. In
addition, elderly with a diagnosis of depression may be
at an elevated risk of cerebrovascular disorder malig-
nant tumors, respiratory disorders, or suicide. Further
detailed clinical investigations in other populations are
warranted to elucidate the link between depression and
mortality.
