Depression as a Risk Factor for the Incidence of First-Ever
Stroke in 85-Year-Olds
Martin Liebetrau, MD; Bertil Steen, MD, PhD; Ingmar Skoog, MD, PhD
Background and Purpose—Depression may increase the risk for stroke. Few studies have examined whether depression
increases the risk for stroke in the very old and among the demented. We examined the relation between depression in
85-year-olds and the 3-year incidence of first-ever stroke.
Methods—A representative sample of 494 85-year-olds (147 demented, 347 nondemented) in Gothenburg, Sweden, was
examined with psychiatric examinations and key informant interviews. Diagnoses of depression and dementia were
made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Revision. The sample was followed
for 3 years regarding the incidence of stroke. Information on stroke was obtained from the Swedish Hospital Discharge
Register, death certificates, self-reports, and key informants. Those with known stroke history at baseline (n93) were
excluded from the incidence study.
Results—The prevalence of depression at age 85 was 19%. Depression at baseline (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 4.7;
P0.0006) and systolic blood pressure (hazard ratio, 1.014 per 1 mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.03; P0.019) were related
to increased incidence of first-ever stroke during follow-up. Depression increased stroke risk both among demented and
nondemented individuals. Among the symptoms of depression, only depressed mood was an independent predictor of
incidence first-ever stroke in multivariate analyses. Stroke history at age 85 was not associated with clinical depression.
Conclusions—Depression and stroke are both common in elderly populations. The finding that depression increases risk
for first-ever stroke indicates that detection and treatment of depression may have implications for stroke prevention.

T
he prevalence of depression and stroke is high in the
elderly.1,2 It has long been noted that depression is
common after stroke3 and that depression is associated with
increased mortality in patients with stroke.4 During the last
decade, results from animal studies and from prospective
population-based studies suggest that depression may also
increase the risk for cardiovascular accidents or stroke.5–11
The population-based studies were based on relatively young
populations, and only one study11 excluded stroke at baseline.
In some studies, the depressed had elevated blood pressure at
baseline9,10 or had more vascular risk factors than nonde-
pressed individuals.11 The Framingham Study11 recently re-
ported a more than 4-fold increased risk of stroke in those
with depressive symptoms, but this relation was only found
among individuals younger than age 65 and not in older
individuals, in whom stroke prevalence and incidence is
highest. In this age group, stroke is an important contributor
to dementia and other disabilities.12,13 Furthermore, it is not
known if depression increases risk for first-ever stroke among
the demented. Hypotheses why depression may increase
stroke risk include that depression exerts large stress on the
individual and that depression is often related to silent
cerebrovascular diseases, which may increase the risk of
further strokes. Depression as a risk factor for stroke may
have important implications for stroke prevention because it
is both treatable and common.
We have previously reported that 19% of 85 year olds had
depression14 and that the 3-year cumulative incidence of
first-ever stroke was 14% between ages 85 and 88.2
The aim of this study was to examine the relation between
depression and the incidence of first-ever stroke in a
population-based sample of stroke-free 85-year-olds. The
present study is part of the Longitudinal Gerontological and
Geriatric Population Studies (H70) in Go¨teborg, Sweden.15,16
Methods
Subjects
All 85-year-olds born between July 1, 1901, and June 30, 1902, and
registered for census purposes in Go¨teborg, Sweden, were invited to
take part in a health survey in 1986 to 1987. People living in the
community and at institutions were included. Every second person
(n784) was systematically selected for a neuropsychiatric exami-
nation and 494 accepted (response rate, 63%; 144 men, 350 women).

Nonparticipants and participants did not differ regarding gender,
marital status, 3-year mortality rate, and registration as psychiatric
outpatients or inpatients in Go¨teborg.13
We excluded 93 individuals with stroke history at baseline (age
85) for the follow-up analyses. Information on new strokes during
follow-up was derived from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Regis-
ter and death certificates on all 401 individuals,2 and from self-
reports (n235) and key informant interviews (n190) during a
follow-up examination at age 88 (performed 1989 to 1990). Among
401 stroke-free individuals at age 85, 104 had died and 62 refused
the follow-up examination at age 88.
Informed consent was obtained from all participants and/or their
relatives. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for
Medical Research at Go¨teborg University.
Methods
The study included home visits by a nurse, physical examinations by
geriatricians (including assessment of physical disorders), neuropsy-
chiatric examinations and key informant interviews by a psychiatrist,
and extensive laboratory examinations, including blood and serum
samples, electrocardiograms, chest x-rays, and CT of the head.
Casual blood pressure was measured in the right arm in the seated
position after 5 minutes of rest using a mercury manometer. Systolic
and diastolic blood pressure were registered to the nearest 5 mm Hg.
Hypertension was defined as blood pressure above 160/90 mm Hg or
antihypertensive treatment. Myocardial infarction and atrial fibrilla-
tion were defined as a history or electrocardiographic manifestations.
Diabetes was defined as a history of diabetes told by a doctor.
Hypercholesterolemia was defined as cholesterol above 6.22 mmol/L.
Overweight was defined as a body mass index above 25 kg/m2.
Education was defined as 6 years of compulsory education or more.
Alcohol consumption was defined as weekly use of any alcoholic
beverage. The neuropsychiatric examination was performed by an
experienced psychiatrist in the subject’s place of residence and
included questions about social factors, psychiatric and stroke
symptoms, cognitive measures (eg, memory, language, visuospatial
ability), and observed variables (eg, psychiatric symptoms, neuro-
logical symptoms) as described previously.13,14 The key informant
telephone interview (performed by a neuropsychiatrist in 451 par-
ticipants at age 85 and in 190 at age 88) included questions about
cognitive, psychiatric, and stroke symptoms. Both examinations
were semistructured allowing clarifying questions, eg, in the ques-
tions about history of stroke, several synonyms for stroke were given
to the participant.
Diagnostic Procedures
Dementia
A diagnosis of dementia and its severity was made according to the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Revi-
sion as previously described.13
Depression
The diagnosis of depression at age 85 was made according to the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Revi-
sion criteria using a symptom algorithm based on the assessments of
symptoms made by a psychiatrist during an examination with a mean
length of 83 minutes (range, 20 to 191 minutes), as described
previously,17 and included the categories major depression, dysthy-
mia, and depression not otherwise specified. The diagnoses were
based on symptoms during the month preceding the examination and
observed symptoms during the psychiatric examination. Symptoms
included in the diagnoses are depressed mood, diminished interest or
pleasure, decreased appetite, sleep problems, psychomotor agitation
or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness
and guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisive-
ness, and thoughts of death or suicidal feelings. Interrater reliability
between psychiatrists for the assessment of these symptoms using
Spearman rank order correlations ranged from 0.87 (insomnia) to
1.00 (decreased appetite). For observed signs of depression, the rank
order correlations ranged from 0.55 (inability to think or concentrate)
to 0.88 (decreased amount of speech). For reported symptoms of
depressed mood, it was 0.98, and for observed depressed mood, it
was 0.81.
Stroke
The diagnosis of stroke has been described in detail previously2 and
was based on information from 3 sources (self-reports, key infor-
mants, and Swedish Hospital Discharge Register). Participants and
key informants (eg, spouse or child) were interviewed by a neuro-
psychiatrist regarding stroke symptoms. The participants were also
interviewed by a geriatrician. The interviews included questions
about sudden onset of focal symptoms or acute aphasia and admis-
sion to the hospital due to stroke. All side notes and answers to these
questions were examined by a stroke neurologist and a neuropsychi-
atrist. Only stroke cases with a definite history of acute focal
symptoms (hemiparesis or acute aphasia) were included (as an
example, stroke was self-reported in 98 cases at age 85 but only 53
were accepted after review of side notes).
The diagnosis of stroke was also derived from the computerized
Swedish Hospital Discharge Register, in which all hospital admis-
sions in Sweden have been registered and classified according to the
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition (codes 430 to
438 for stroke) since 1978. In addition, strokes were identified by
death certificates.
Calculation of stroke incidence was based on person-years at risk
and computed as subjects affected in the interval divided by sum of
person-years at risk. The risk time was calculated as the time from
the examination at age 85 to time of stroke, death, or 36 months,
whichever came first. In cases of missing information about onset,
the assumption was made that onset occurred in the middle of the
follow-up period and risk time was calculated as time between the
examinations divided by 2.
Statistical Methods
The associations between depression and stroke at age 85 were tested
for significance with Fisher exact test, and OR were calculated with
logistic regression analyses.
The associations between depression or depressive symptoms at
age 85 and incidence of first-ever stroke between age 85 and 88 were
tested with Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. The risks
were calculated as number of incidence cases divided by the number
of person-years. Hazard ratios were calculated for factors related to
the incidence and risk time of stroke and the relation between
baseline depression and depression symptoms and the incidence and
risk time of stroke.
Potential confounders considered were sex, education, smoking,
hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol lev-
els, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, and
treatment with anxiolytics, antidepressants or antihypertensives.
Those variables that were significant at P0.10 in these models
(depression, systolic blood pressure) were then entered into a Cox
regression analysis together with sex. The final model included
depression at baseline, sex, and systolic blood pressure.
Because the significance of the Cox regression model parameter
rests on large sample approximations, we also used these risk
estimates to compare the significance level of the Cox models with
a nonparametric exact test of the difference between 2 Poisson
rates.18 Because the results always agreed, we only report the results
from the Cox models.
We also validated the Cox proportional model by including an
interaction term with risk time. This did not improve the explanatory
power of the model (change in 2 631.2 to 630.8).
Results
Depression at Age 85 in Relation to Stroke History
at Age 85
Among all 85-year-olds, 93 had a history of stroke, 93
(18.8%; 67 of 351 women, 26 of 143 men) were diagnosed
with depression (58 had major depression, 25 dysthymia, and

10 depression not otherwise specified), and 147 (108 women,
39 men) were diagnosed with dementia. The prevalence of
depression was similar in those with and without stroke at age
85 (22.6% [N21 of 93] versus 18.0% [N72 of 401]; OR,
1.3; 95% CI, 0.8 to 2.3).
Among the 85-year-olds, 8.6% used antidepressants (N8
of 93) among those with a stroke history and 5.0% (N20 of
401) among those without (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.8 to 4.2),
23.7% used neuroleptics (N22 of 93) among those with
stroke history and 11.7% (N47 of 401) among those
without (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3 to 4.1), and 35.5% used any
anxiolytic drugs (N33 of 93) in those with known stroke
and 33.9% (N136 of 401) in those without (OR, 1.1; 95%
CI, 0.7 to 1.7). The significant association for neuroleptics
disappeared completely when controlling for dementia, be-
cause those who were demented more often had previous
stroke and more often had been receiving neuroleptics.
We also made separate analyses with the demented indi-
viduals excluded (N147), leaving 347 nondemented 85-
year-olds for analyses. Among these, 40 had a history of
stroke, and 62 (17.9%; 45 of 243 women, 17 of 104 men)
were diagnosed with depression (38 had major depression, 22
dysthymia, and 2 depression not otherwise specified). The
prevalence of depression was similar in those with and
without stroke at age 85 (15.0% [N6 of 40] versus 18.2%
[N56 of 307]; OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.3 to 2.0).
Depression at Age 85 in Relation to 3-Year
Incidence of Stroke
Demographic factors in relation to depression among stroke-
free 85-year-olds are described in Table 1. Those with depres-
sion had a lower diastolic blood pressure, more often used
antidepressants, and had a higher 3-year mortality rate than
those without depression. These results were similar when
demented individuals were excluded from the analyses.
Among 85-year-olds without stroke (n401), 56 individ-
uals had their first-ever stroke between ages 85 and 88
(according to self-reports in 19 cases, key informants in 19
cases, hospital linkage system and death certificates in 45
cases). The incidence of first-ever stroke was higher in those
with depression at age 85 (116.5 of 1000 person-years) than
in the rest of the sample (46.1 of 1000 person-years; relative
risk [RR], 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5 to 4.6; P0.0009). Depression at
baseline was related to an increased incidence of stroke both
among the demented (RR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 9.8) and the
nondemented (RR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.6; Table 2). The risk
of incident stroke was similar in those with major depression
(RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.9 to 3.9) and those with dysthymic
disorder (RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 0.9 to 5.8) at baseline.
A multivariate model, including depression at age 85, sex,
and systolic blood pressure, found that depression at baseline
(hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 4.7; P0.0006) and systolic
blood pressure (HR, 1.014 per 1 mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.00 to
1.03; P0.019) were independently related to the incidence
of first-ever stroke. The results were similar when demented
and nondemented individuals were analyzed separately.
We then examined whether the 9 specific symptom clusters
included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Third Revision criteria were related to the inci-
dence of stroke in the whole sample. We also examined
whether anxiety, common in depression but not included in
the criteria, was related to the incidence of stroke in the whole
sample. Among these 10 symptoms, only depressed mood
and loss of interest or pleasure were related to an increased
incidence of stroke in univariate analyses considering each
symptom separately (Table 3). A Cox regression multivari-
able model including all 10 symptoms showed that only

depressed mood was independently related to an increased
risk for stroke. The findings were similar when demented
individuals were excluded.
Use of Psychotropic Drugs at Age 85 in Relation
to the Incidence of Stroke
Use of psychotropic drugs at age 85 was not related to stroke
incidence at follow-up (Table 4). These results did not change
after controlling for depression at age 85 and excluding
demented individuals.
Discussion
We found that depression was associated with an increased
incidence of first-ever stroke in a representative population of
85-year-olds followed for 3 years. The increased risk was
found both among the demented and the nondemented. Our
results are in accordance with recent studies in younger,
nondemented age groups and further support the hypothesis
that depression may be a risk factor, or prodrome, for stroke.6–8,11
The relative risk (2.6) in our study is similar to that reported
by Larson et al (2.7),7 Jonas and colleagues (RR, 1.7),8 and Ohira
et al (RR, 1.9).6 These studies were, however, conducted in
younger samples, in which the incidence of stroke was
relatively low, and individuals with stroke at baseline were
not excluded. Interestingly, Salaycik et al found an increased
stroke incidence in those with depressive symptoms only in
individuals aged younger than 65.11 Our findings are also in
accordance with data from the Women’s Health Initiative
based on 94 000 younger women indicating that depression is
a risk factor for stroke incidence.10 The current data provide
evidence that in women, this effect persists even among the
very old.
The prevalence of depression in our study was 19% among
nondemented 85-year-olds compared with 7.5% to 13.0% in
the other studies. The incidence of stroke in our study was
57.2 per 1000 person-years compared with 7.6 per 1000
person-years in the study by Ohira et al.6 The frequency of
both depression and stroke is high in very old individuals.
Thus, population-attributable risk of depression for stroke

risk is considerable, which is important in relation to preven-
tion. We further found that depressed mood, which was found
in 27% of the 85-year-olds, was the only individual symptom
in the depression syndrome that was independently related to
increased risk of first-ever stroke. Our findings suggest that
detection of depression, and even milder forms of depressed
mood, may be important for stroke prevention in the elderly.
Another interesting finding, which we are the first to
report, was that depression increased risk for first-ever stroke
also among demented individuals. One third of the 85-year-
olds in our study had dementia,13 and 57% of the demented
had a stroke history already at baseline.2 Dementia was not
related to incidence of first-ever stroke in our study, but some
other studies have reported an increased incidence of stroke
in demented individuals.19,20 Our finding is remarkable be-
cause depression is difficult to assess in demented individu-
als. Support for the validity of the diagnosis is that all
individuals were assessed by a psychiatrist during a 1.5-hour
examination.
The association between depression and first-ever stroke
may have several explanations. First, depression has been
associated with myocardial arrhythmia,21 increased platelet
activation,22 and increased insulin resistance.23 These changes
in the vascular system might increase the risk of stroke.
Second, depression has been associated with several risk
factors for stroke, eg, smoking, high body mass index, and
increased blood pressure. However, none of these factors
were related to depression in our study. Instead, lower
diastolic blood pressure was associated with depression at
baseline, especially among the nondemented. Besides depres-
sion, only higher systolic blood pressure at baseline was
related to increased incidence of stroke, but increased blood
pressure did not affect the relation between depression at
baseline and stroke incidence. Third, late-life depression has
been suggested to be related to silent cerebrovascular diseases
such as ischemic white matter lesions, which are related to an
increased incidence of stroke.24 Although depression was not
related to ischemic white matter lesions on CT in this
sample,25 it is possible that the use of MRI would have
detected more cases of mild white matter lesions. Fourth,
depression exerts large stress on the individual, which might
increase the risk of stroke. Finally, depression might lead to
lower drug compliance, including antihypertensive drugs,
which may increase the risk of stroke.
In contrast to numerous clinical studies,3 a history of stroke
was not related to depression at baseline. Survival effect may
be one reason because both stroke and depression are related
to an increased mortality rate, and depression is related to
increased mortality in patients with stroke. This may attenu-
ate a relation between stroke and depression in cross-
sectional studies.
Among the strengths of the study are that the diagnosis of
depression was based on an interview conducted by a
psychiatrist, the extensive data-gathering, that the sample was
representative of the general population in this age group and
included both individuals living in the community as well as
in institutions,13 and that dementia and stroke were diagnosed
with comprehensive assessments. As reported previously, the
detection of stroke in the elderly depends on the number of
information sources.2 We used 3 sources of information
(self-report, hospital register, key informants). Using several
information sources to detect stroke was especially important
regarding exclusion of stroke at baseline because unreported
strokes probably are related to an increased risk for stroke at
follow-up. There are also some limitations. First, 20% of the
sample did not have key informant interviews, which may
have underestimated the frequency of stroke. The frequency
of stroke might also be underestimated by the fact that silent
strokes identified by imaging were not included in this study.
Second, some subgroups in this study included small num-
bers, yielding low statistical power. It is possible that a larger
sample might have revealed significant associations between
depression and incidence of stroke also in men. Third, in
contrast to other studies,7 we also included dysthymia for the
diagnosis of depression, which might result in an overestima-
tion of depressive disorders. Fourth, it has to be emphasized
that a study on 85-year-olds includes the possibility of
survival effects. However, both depression and stroke are
related to an increased mortality rate, and survival effects
should rather decrease the possibility to find associations
between these factors.
In conclusion, the findings from this study may have
clinical implications because depression and stroke are com-
mon in the elderly. The possible risk reduction of stroke is
thus one more reason why individuals with depression should
be diagnosed and adequately treated. However, randomized,
controlled trials are needed before any conclusions can be
made regarding the effect of antidepressants for stroke
prevention. Most epidemiological studies report that only a
small minority of all individuals with depression are detected
and treated.1 Depressive disorders disrupt social function and
reduce quality of life for both patients and their relatives and

cause excess disability and mortality in the elderly. It is also
the most important factor for suicide in the elderly. Our
findings further emphasize that even mild depression is a
serious disorder with serious consequences. The SADHART
study found that treatment of depression with sertraline in
patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina
decreased platelet activation26 and cardiovascular events.27
Whether successful treatment of depression may reduce the
incidence of first-ever stroke needs to be further elucidated.
Even if depression treatment does not reduce stroke inci-
dence,11 patients with depression may be an important target
for control and optimizing of other vascular risk factors.
