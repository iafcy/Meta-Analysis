Risk Factors for Ischemic Stroke
Dubbo Study of the Elderly
Leon A. Simons, MD; John McCallum, DPhil; Yechiel Friedlander, PhD; Judith Simons, MACS
Background and Purpose—One in 10 deaths in Australia is due to stroke. The predictors of ischemic stroke have not been
well defined, although hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and previous stroke have been consistently reported. We report
on 98 months’ follow-up in a prospective study of cardiovascular disease in the Australian elderly, the Dubbo Study.
Methods—The cohort, first examined in 1988, was composed of 2805 men and women 60 years and older. The prediction
of ischemic stroke by potential risk factors was examined in a Cox proportional hazards model, after linkage to hospital
and death records.
Results—Three hundred six men and women manifested an ischemic stroke event (ICD-9-CM 433 to 437), and 95 subjects
suffered a fatal stroke event. In the multivariate model, the significant independent predictors of stroke were advancing
age, female sex (48% lower risk), being married (30% lower risk), prior history of stroke (227% higher risk), use of
antihypertensive drugs (37% higher risk), belonging to the highest category of blood pressure reading (67% higher risk),
presence of atrial fibrillation (58% higher risk), HDL cholesterol (36% lower risk for each 1-mmol/L increment),
impaired peak expiratory flow (77% higher risk for tertile I than for tertile III), physical disability (59% higher risk),
and depression score (41% higher risk for tertile III than for tertile I).
Conclusions—These findings suggest that morbidity and mortality associated with ischemic stroke can be predicted by
various clinical indicators, some of which may be amenable to intervention. The matters of impaired peak expiratory
flow, depression score, and ischemic stroke require further study. (Stroke. 1998;29:1341-1346.)

O
ne in 4 deaths in Australia in 1994 was due to CHD; 1
in 10 was due to stroke.1 Current treatment for patients
with established stroke is relatively ineffective. Surveys of
stroke survivors indicate that more than 50% have severe and
permanent disability.2 Compared with the volume of prospec-
tive studies in CHD, there have been relatively fewer popu-
lation studies investigating the precursors of stroke. Although
most strokes occur in elderly people, exposures at younger
ages may be significant ones. Effective risk factor interven-
tion offers a real hope of reducing stroke morbidity and
mortality. Randomized, controlled intervention studies have
demonstrated significant prevention of stroke with manage-
ment of hypertension3 or hypercholesterolemia.4
Certain risk factors have consistently been identified as
significant predictors of stroke outcome (mainly fatal stroke):
age, hypertension, antihypertensive treatment, alcohol intake
(inverse prediction), previous stroke, and atrial fibrillation.5–9
Other risk factors much less consistently associated with
stroke include smoking, diabetes, previous CHD, ECG evi-
dence of left ventricular hypertrophy, excessive alcohol
intake, and family history of stroke.5,7,9,10 The relationship
between serum cholesterol and stroke remains somewhat
elusive,8 possibly because of a negative association with
hemorrhagic stroke on one hand11,12 and a positive association
with ischemic stroke on the other.9,12 The present report
examines the prediction of ischemic stroke by demographic,
psychosocial, behavioral, and conventional cardiovascular
risk factors in a cohort of elderly Australians followed for 98
months since 1988.
Subjects and Methods
Subjects and Baseline Examinations
The Dubbo Study is an ongoing prospective study of cardiovascular
disease in an elderly Australian cohort first examined in 1988 to
1989.13 All noninstitutionalized residents of the town of Dubbo born
before 1930 were eligible; participation rate was 73% (1235 men and
1570 women). Methods and measures have been described in detail
elsewhere.2,13 Briefly, baseline examinations comprised demo-
graphic, psychosocial, and standard cardiovascular risk factor assess-
ments. The medical examination included height and weight, blood
pressure (10 minutes’ seated rest; phase V diastolic; mean of two
readings), resting ECG (Minnesota Code),14 and peak expiratory
flow rate (Wright peak flowmeter; best of two attempts).15 We
obtained venous blood (after 12 hours’ fast) for assessment of total
serum cholesterol and triglycerides by automated enzymatic meth-
ods,16,17 high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol after precipita-

tion with phosphotungstic acid/MgCl2,18 and lipoprotein(a) using a
commercial ELISA kit.19 The laboratory participated in the Austra-
lian Lipid Standardization Program and used standards traceable to
the Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, Ga.
A baseline questionnaire was administered to explore measures of
social support, depression status,20 education, cognitive function,
alcohol and tobacco use, medications, general medical history,
family history of CHD, myocardial infarction and chest pain,
physical activity, self-rated health, and physical disability. The study
was approved by Institutional Ethics Committees at St Vincent’s
Hospital Sydney, the University of New South Wales, and the
Australian National University. All participants gave informed
written consent.
Follow-up Procedures For Stroke Outcomes
Stroke outcomes were ascertained exclusively by review of hospital
and death records (the latter used only in case of death outside
hospital). Postal surveys were conducted every 2 years to confirm
vital status and identify any outcomes that might have been treated
outside the single regional hospital. The latest postal survey in 1997
successfully traced more than 98% of participants. Hospital records
were coded internally according to ICD-9-CM21 and then reviewed
by our own staff. Most subjects were admitted to the hospital when
stroke or transient ischemic attack was suspected. CT of the head
was performed in 70% of stroke cases. Cerebral arteriography was
not routinely performed. Subjects with hemorrhagic stroke events
(codes 431 and 432) were few (n529) and excluded from all
analyses. Ischemic stroke was taken as the inclusive coding 433 to
437. Transient ischemic attack (code 435) was included in the
grouping “all strokes,” as in the Framingham Study.6 However, code
438 was excluded, since this represented only 9 subjects in whom the
precise diagnosis was uncertain. Outcomes up to June 30, 1997, were
included in this analysis, a median 98 months’ follow-up.
Statistical Methods
For the purpose of risk factor studies, subjects were followed until
the first in-study presentation of stroke. Stroke at study entry was
based on any previous diagnosis by a physician. CHD at study entry
was defined as a positive myocardial infarction questionnaire, and/or
positive angina (Rose) questionnaire,14 and/or ECG changes (Q
waves, T-wave inversion, or left bundle branch block). Many of the
variables used are self-explanatory, but some require specific
definition:
(1) Blood pressure (4 categories): SBP ,140 mm Hg and DBP
,90 mm Hg; SBP 140 to 159 or DBP 90 to 94; SBP 160 to 199 or
DBP 95 to 99; SBP $200 or DBP $100.
(2) A separate variable indicating the intake of antihypertensive
medication.
(3) Cigarette smoking: never, former, or current.
(4) Diabetes mellitus: prior history, fasting plasma glucose level of
$7.8 mmol/L, and/or using medication for diabetes.
(5) Lipoprotein(a): quintiles, because of the skewed distribution.18
(6) Peak expiratory flow: tertiles, with tertile I indicating the
greatest impairment.
(7) Self-rated health (3 categories): very good to excellent, good,
and fair to poor.
(8) Disability (in 3 categories based on physical ADL): no
disability, one impairment in ADL, and .1 impairment in ADL.
(9) Depression score: tertiles, tertile III indicating greater evidence
of depression.
The independent contribution of any risk factor to stroke outcome
was examined in a Cox proportional hazards model, which was used
to account for the variable follow-up time. Point estimates and 95%
confidence intervals for the RR of stroke were calculated from the
regression coefficients. Variables were entered into the model in a
single block. A final model was recalculated as the most parsimo-
nious version, including only significant variables or others that were
potential confounders. Variables were introduced as continuous or
categorical variables, as indicated in “Results.” With categorical
variables, the lowest or opposite category served as the reference
group. Interaction terms between various independent predictors
were also explored in the final model. The proportional hazards
model assumes constant relative hazard over the length of follow-up.
This assumption was confirmed by a log-minus-log hazard plot
demonstrating parallel curves over all categories for various predic-
tors. Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS for Windows,
Release 7.0 (SPSS, Inc).

incidence rates for all ischemic stroke events are presented in
Table 2. The incidence rates were higher in men than in
women up to 79 years of age; thereafter, they were higher
in women. Overall, rates increased with age.
The following variables were removed from the final
multivariate model because they did not predict stroke out-
come and were not considered major confounders: lipopro-
tein(a), alcohol intake, ECG evidence of left ventricular
hypertrophy, and family history of premature CHD. The final
Cox proportional hazards models included many significant
predictors, and the results are presented in Table 3 for all
stroke events and for fatal stroke events.
The significant independent predictors of stroke were
increasing age, female sex (48% lower risk than males), being
married (30% lower risk), prior history of stroke (227%
higher risk), use of antihypertensive medication (37% higher
risk), belonging to the highest category of blood pressure
reading (67% higher risk than for the lowest category),
presence of atrial fibrillation (58% higher risk; P,0.10),
HDL cholesterol (36% lower risk for each 1-mmol/L incre-
ment), body mass index (minimally lower risk with increas-
ing values), peak expiratory flow rate (77% higher risk for
tertile I than for tertile III), physical disability (59% higher
risk for those with .1 impairment in ADL) and depression
score (41% higher risk for those in tertile III than in tertile I).
Notable by their absence of significant prediction were prior
CHD, diabetes, total cholesterol and triglycerides, current
cigarette smoking, and alcohol intake.
There were generally similar predictors for fatal stroke
events, although statistical significance was reduced because
of smaller event numbers. The following contrasts, though,
were noted in regard to prediction of fatal stroke: the presence
of atrial fibrillation was associated with a .200% higher risk
of fatal stroke and a 58% higher risk of any stroke; depression
score tertile III was associated with a 130% higher risk of
fatal stroke and a 41% excess risk of any stroke. Fig 1 and 2
illustrate the cumulative hazard in the multivariate model for

The multivariate model was recalculated to explore inter-
action terms between significant predictors of stroke events
and age, sex, and past history of stroke. The significant
interactions were blood pressure reading and sex (P,0.02),
marital status and sex (P,0.05), and depression score and
age (P,0.001). The model was recalculated for the separate
sexes and for those 60 to 69 years and 701 years of age
(Table 4). Being married significantly predicted stroke out-
come only in women (RR, 0.54). Blood pressure reading
significantly predicted stroke only in women and in a graded
fashion (RR for highest category, 2.46). Depression score
tertile III significantly predicted stroke only in the age group
701 years (RR, 1.83).
Discussion
This is the first report on stroke outcomes from the prospec-
tive Dubbo Study of cardiovascular disease in the Australian
elderly. Our earlier reports have explored the more frequent
CHD outcome.23 To our knowledge, only one other Austra-
lian study, the Busselton Study, has reported prospective risk
factor data for stroke.9 Although stroke is predominantly a
disease of the elderly, nearly all other longitudinal studies of
stroke followed subjects from middle age into old age.8 The
Dubbo Study differs in this major respect; it commenced with
senior citizens having a mean age of 69 years. Other studies
performed specifically in the elderly have yet to publish
definitive stroke analyses.24,25 A study of cardiovascular
disease specifically in the elderly represents a study of
selected “survivors,” and this could bias some of the risk
factor relationships. However, this type of study is important
because it explores risk factor relationships in the “well
elderly.”
We have confirmed certain risk factors for ischemic stroke
that have been consistently identified in earlier studies;
namely, increasing age, hypertension and use of antihyper-
tensive treatment, prior stroke, and presence of atrial fibril-
lation.5–9 We have identified additional risk factors that have
been much less consistently associated with ischemic stroke:
namely, male sex, HDL cholesterol, body mass index, and
physical disability. We have identified additional risk factors
not previously linked to increased stroke risk: namely, being
unmarried, having impaired peak expiratory flow, and having
some evidence of depression. Finally, we have failed to
confirm prediction of ischemic stroke by important vascular
risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, diabetes, previous
CHD, left ventricular hypertrophy, total cholesterol or tri-
glycerides, lipoprotein(a), and alcohol intake.
Antihypertensive treatment predicting future stroke or
coronary disease is a finding that sometimes excites com-
ment.9,23,24 It may be speculated that an increased risk of
stroke in the presence of hypertension may not be fully
reversible, or perhaps treatment has been inappropriate or
inadequate. However, clinical trials in the elderly have clearly
demonstrated cardiovascular disease prevention by antihyper-
tensive drug therapy,3 albeit under strictly controlled
circumstances.
Approximately 85% of strokes result from cerebral infarc-
tion. Emboli from the heart may be responsible for up to 20%
of these cases.26,27 Almost one half of these events complicate
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.28 Given the age of the Dubbo
cohort, it is possible that a very small proportion of subjects
with atrial fibrillation may have rheumatic valvular disease.
We possess no specific data on this point, but it is likely that
atrial fibrillation in the majority of our subjects was nonval-
vular in origin. In the presence of atrial fibrillation, we have
identified a 60% excess risk of stroke and a 200% excess risk
of stroke death (Table 3). The Framingham Study reported an
RR of stroke with atrial fibrillation of 2.6 in the age group 60
to 69 years, 3.3 in those 70 to 79 years, and 4.5 in those
older,6 suggesting an interaction with age. We found no
similar interaction between atrial fibrillation and age in the
prediction of ischemic stroke. In the Busselton Study the RR
for stroke mortality in the presence of atrial fibrillation was
5.9.9 Anticoagulant therapy with warfarin has been shown to
reduce the future risk of stroke in patients with atrial
fibrillation but would not be indicated below 65 years in the
absence of other major risk factors.29
The serum cholesterol–stroke association remains an
enigma. If low serum cholesterol concentration is associated
with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke11,12 and increased
cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of ischemic
stroke,9,12 this could be the reason that an examination of
13 000 strokes in 450 000 persons drawn from 45 prospective
cohorts failed to find an association between serum choles-
terol and stroke (ie, hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke com-
bined).8 In the present study there was no evidence of a
quadratic relationship between total cholesterol and stroke.
However, HDL cholesterol was an important predictor of
ischemic stroke, as we have already shown for CHD in this
elderly cohort23 and others have shown for asymptomatic
carotid atherosclerosis.30 Confusion in the relationship be-
tween total cholesterol and stroke may only be settled when
studies can report a greater number of events in carefully
documented, different stroke types. To add to the present

interest, it is becoming clear that statin drugs used to lower
cholesterol levels do indeed reduce future stroke risk.4 But it
is recognized that statin drugs do more than merely lower
serum cholesterol level.31
The relationship between impaired peak expiratory flow
and ischemic stroke has not, to our knowledge, been previ-
ously reported. There has been renewed interest in the
relationship between CHD and obstructive airways disease or
chronic bronchitis.32 We have previously reported33 that peak
expiratory flow tertile I was associated with increased risk of
all-cause mortality (62% excess risk in men and 92% in
women) and CHD mortality (75% excess risk in men and
158% in women). Peak expiratory flow rate, one measure of
obstructive airways disease, is influenced by age, height, and
gender.15 Our CHD findings were obtained in a multivariate
model that controlled for these and many other variables. Our
present findings vis-a-vis stroke were not materially influ-
enced if height was introduced into the proportional hazards
model. A Swedish study noted a trend toward increasing risk
of stroke in those with reduced vital capacity.5 The Cardio-
vascular Health Study is another prospective study in the
elderly that has assessed forced expiratory volume in one
second and vital capacity, but it has not yet reported specific
prospective findings in the stroke area.25 The pathways from
impaired peak expiratory flow and respiratory disease to
CHD or stroke are unclear. Cigarette smoking is one sug-
gested linkage, although not supported in the present data.
Other pathways may include changes in blood coagulation34
or the presence of specific infection.35
Currently married women had a 46% lower risk of stroke,
while marital status was not predictive for men. This contrasts
with our finding that marriage predicted a 25% lower all-
cause mortality rate in both men and women.36 The smaller
surviving cohort of married women (50% of women) may be
less exposed to stroke risk than the larger group of surviving
married men (79% of men). The reasons for this are unclear
but may relate to stronger selection biases for women or
differential benefits from social support in marriage. We have
observed apparent negative effects of marriage on all-cause
mortality for male and female diabetics,37 so these factors are
known to be complex in this population.
We have not assessed clinical depression. However, sub-
jects in tertile III of the depression score distribution would
have more depressive symptoms than those in tertile I.20
There is evidence from MRI studies38,39 that changes in the
brain (deep white matter hyperintensities and reduction in
basal ganglia volumes) are associated with onset of depres-
sion in late life. These changes appear to be associated with
vascular risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes,39 but
this will require confirmation in ongoing studies. If late-onset
depression has a vascular basis, we have another plausible
marker for future stroke. It is not suggested that depression
per se leads to stroke. Rather, it is possible that depression
and ischemic stroke share a common etiology. At entry to the
Dubbo Study, 50% of subjects having a past history of stroke
belonged to depression score tertile III compared with 35% of
subjects having no past history. The corresponding propor-
tions in depression score tertile I were 14% and 31%.
However, cross-sectional data of this type should be viewed
with extreme caution, since these subjects were manifesting
increased evidence of depression after the onset of stroke or
other serious illness. This was similarly true for cross-
sectional relationships with physical disability. Almost 50%
of subjects with prior stroke had .1 impairment in ADL, the
proportion being only 21% in those without prior history. In
many ways physical disability acted as a surrogate for prior
stroke in predicting ischemic stroke.
To summarize some of our key findings (and those of
others), hypertension predicts ischemic stroke and blood
pressure management has been shown to prevent future
strokes.3 Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation predicts ischemic
stroke and anticoagulant therapy with warfarin has been
shown to reduce the risk of future stroke.29 This therapy is
presently underutilized.40,41 Impaired peak expiratory flow
predicts future stroke, but the benefits of treatment in preven-
tion of stroke are unknown. Depression predicts ischemic
stroke, and both conditions may have a common etiology.
Treatment of stroke risk factors might conceivably reduce the
future risk of depression or stroke.
