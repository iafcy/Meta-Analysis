Association Between Depressive Symptoms
and Mortality in Older Women
Mary A. Whooley, MD; Warren S. Browner, MD, MPH;

Background: Major depression is associated with
increased mortality, but it is not known whether
patients who report depressive symptoms have greater
mortality.
Subjects and Methods: We performed a prospective
cohort study of 7518 white women 67 years of age or older
who were recruited from population-based listings in Bal-
timore, Md, Minneapolis, Minn, Portland, Ore, and the
Monongahela Valley, Pa. Participants completed the Ge-
riatric Depression Scale (short form) and were consid-
ered depressed if they reported 6 or more of 15 possible
symptoms of depression. Women were followed up for
an average of 6 years. If a participant died, we obtained
a copy of the official death certificate and hospital re-
cords, if available, and used International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes to classify death attrib-
utable to cardiovascular, cancer, or noncancer, noncar-
diovascular cause.
Results: Mortality during 7-year follow-up varied from
7% in women with no depressive symptoms to 17% in
those with 3 to 5 symptoms to 24% in those with 6 or
more symptoms of depression (P,.001). Of 473 women
(6.3%) with 6 or more depressive symptoms at baseline,
24% died (111 deaths in 2610 woman-years of follow-
up) compared with 11% of women who reported 5 or
fewer symptoms of depression (760 deaths in 41 460
woman-years of follow-up) (P,.001). Women with 6 or
more depressive symptoms had a 2-fold increased risk
of death (age-adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.14; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 1.75-2.61; P,.001) compared with
those who had 5 or fewer depressive symptoms. This as-
sociation remained strong after adjusting for potential con-
founding variables, including history of myocardial in-
farction, stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, perceived health,
and cognitive function (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.14-1.88;
P = .003). Depressive symptoms were associated with
an increased adjusted risk of death from cardiovascular
diseases (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.5; P = .003), and non-
cancer, noncardiovascular diseases (HR, 1.8; 95% CI,
1.2-2.7; P = .01), but were not associated with deaths from
cancer (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.7; P = .93).
Conclusions: Depressive symptoms are a significant risk
factor for cardiovascular and noncancer, noncardiovascu-
lar mortality but not cancer mortality in older women.
Whether depressive symptoms are a marker for, or a cause
of, life-threatening conditions remains to be determined.

ANY STUDIES1-13 have
found that clinically di-
agnosed major depres-
sion is associated with
increasedmortality,but
it is unclear whether depressive symp-
toms, such as those recognized in a rou-
tine office visit or on a simple screening in-
strument,predictmortality.Priorstudies14-20
have found that depressive symptoms are
associated with poor health and functional
status, as well as increased disability, health
care utilization, and cost of health ser-
vices. However, results have been inconsis-
tent regarding a possible association be-
tween depressive symptoms and mortality.
Two large studies21,22 found no asso-
ciation between baseline depressive symp-
toms and subsequent mortality, but 2 oth-
ers23,24 reported greater mortality in
patients with depressive symptoms. Of
these 2 studies, one23 was limited to pa-
tients with preexisting coronary artery dis-
ease and the other24 did not control for co-
morbid illnesses. Neither examined
mortality from causes other than ische-
mic heart disease.
We measured depressive symptoms
in a cohort of older women and followed
them up for an average of 6 years. We ex-
amined the association between depres-
sive symptoms and mortality from spe-
cific causes such as coronary heart disease,
cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart
failure, cancer, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.

RESULTS
The prevalence of depression (defined as a score $6 on
the Geriatric Depression Scale short form) was 6.3% (473/
7518). Compared with those who had 5 or fewer symp-
toms of depression, women with 6 or more symptoms
were older and more likely to smoke or to report fair or
poor health. They had a higher frequency of medical ill-
nesses, worse functional status, and worse cognitive func-
tion. They were less likely to be married, well-educated,
or physically active (Table 1). Follow-up was com-
plete in 7406 women (99%) who completed the depres-
sion scale. Of the 112 women lost to follow-up, 5.4% had
6 or more depressive symptoms. Mortality varied from
7% in women with no depressive symptoms to 17% in
those with 3 to 5 symptoms to 24% in those with 6 or
more symptoms of depression (P,.001 for trend)
(Figure 1).
Deaths occurred in 24% of women with 6 or more
depressive symptoms (111 deaths in 2610 woman-years
of follow-up) and 11% of women with 5 or fewer depres-
sive symptoms (760 deaths in 41 460 woman-years of fol-
low-up) (P,.001). Participants who subsequently died
had a mean (±SD) depression score of 2.6 ± 2.7, com-
pared with 1.6 ± 2.1 in participants who were alive at fol-
low-up (P,.001).
Women with 6 or more depressive symptoms had
a 2-fold increased risk of death (age-adjusted HR, 2.14;
95% CI, 1.75-2.61; P,.001) compared with those who
had 5 or fewer symptoms. This association remained
strong after adjusting for potential confounding vari-
ables (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.14-1.88; P = .003) (Table 2).
Each 1-symptom increase in number of depressive
symptoms was associated with a 6% increase in all-
cause mortality (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.10; P,.001),
adjusting for history of myocardial infarction, stroke,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, smoking, perceived health, and
cognitive function.
Of 473 women who had 6 or more depressive symp-
toms in 1988-1990, 297 completed the Geriatric Depres-
sion Scale short form again 4 years later, and 159 (53.5%)
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS
A total of 9704 ambulatory women at least 65 years of age
were recruited from population-based listings in Balti-
more, Md, Minneapolis, Minn, Portland, Ore, and the
Monongahela Valley, Pa, between 1986 and 1988 for the
Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, a prospective cohort study
designed to determine risk factors for osteoporotic frac-
tures. At a second visit (1988-1990), 7518 of these women
(80% of survivors) completed at least 10 of 15 items on the
Geriatric Depression Scale. These 7518 women are the sub-
jects of this secondary data analysis. The study was ap-
proved by the appropriate institutional review boards, and
all subjects provided written informed consent.
MEASUREMENTS
Depressive Symptoms
At the second visit (1988-1990), we administered the Geri-
atric Depression Scale short form, a validated, reliable, 15-
item, self-report, depressive symptoms checklist designed to
detect the presence of current depression in the elderly.25 Us-
ing a cutoff point of 6 or more symptoms, the Geriatric De-
pression Scale short form has a sensitivity of 88% and speci-
ficity of 62% compared with a structured clinical interview
for depression.26 We defined depression as 6 or more symp-
toms, with 6 to 7 symptoms indicating mild depression, 8
to 10 symptoms indicating moderate depression, and 11 or
more symptoms indicating severe depression.27 For partici-
pants who failed to complete all 15 items, we calculated the
total number of depressive symptoms by dividing the re-
ported number of symptoms by the proportion of items com-
pleted. To determine the effect of persistent depressive symp-
tomsonsubsequentmortality,wealsoadministeredthesame
instrument 4 years later (1992-1994) to 5837 of the origi-
nal 7518 women (83% of survivors).
Other Measurements
Self-reported age, marital status, education, medical his-
tory, current perceived health status (excellent/good vs
fair/poor/very poor), smoking, alcohol, and use of ben-
zodiazepine, barbiturates, thiazide diuretics, and estro-
gen were determined from a questionnaire administered
at the first visit and reviewed by an interviewer. Systolic
and diastolic blood pressures were measured at the right
brachial artery using a standard protocol.28 Hypertension
was defined as systolic blood pressure higher than 160
mm Hg, diastolic blood pressures higher than 90 mm
Hg, or use of a thiazide diuretic. We measured social
network by scoring answers to 11 questions regarding
contact with spouse, relatives, and friends, then adding
scores for the individual questions to create a total social
network score. Higher scores indicate better social net-
work.
Physical activity was estimated using a modified Paffen-
barger scale that assesses the type and duration of weight-
bearing activities in a variety of settings.29 Participants were
asked about the frequency with which they performed each
of 40 activities at 4 time points during their lives (teen-
ager, age 30 years, age 50 years, and previous year). For
each of the 4 time points, the number of times per year each
activity was performed was multiplied by 5.0 for low-
intensity (eg, walking or gardening), 7.5 for medium-
intensity (eg, dancing or tennis), or 10.0 for high-
intensity activities (eg, jogging or skiing). Scores for these
4 time points were added to calculate lifetime physical
activity.
At the second visit, weight was measured (in light in-
door clothing with shoes removed) using a balance beam
scale, and height was measured using a stadiometer.30 Body
mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by the square of the height in meters. Cognitive function
was measured by a trained examiner using Digit Symbol, a
subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.31 Scores
on Digit Symbol reflect the number correct within the timed
trial; thus, lower scores indicate poorer performance.

of 297 had persistent depressive symptoms. Death oc-
curred in 11.3% of women with 6 or more depressive
symptoms at both time points (18 deaths in 971 woman-
years of follow-up) and 4.3% of women with 5 or fewer
depressive symptoms at both time points (223 deaths in
32 232 woman-years of follow-up) (P,.001). Women
with persistent depressive symptoms had a 2.5-fold in-
creased risk of death (age-adjusted HR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.56-
4.09; P,.001) compared with those who reported 5 or
fewer symptoms at both time points, an association that
persisted but did not remain statistically significant af-
ter adjusting for the variables listed in Table 2 (HR, 1.63;
95% CI, 0.86-3.07; P = .13).
We found that depressive symptoms are both a cause
and an effect of impaired functional status. Among the
7045 participants who had 5 or fewer depressive symp-
toms in 1988-1990, those with impaired functional sta-
tus (n = 172) had a mean (± SD) depression score of 3.5
± 2.8 at follow-up compared with 1.6 ± 1.9 in women
with normal functional status (P,.001); women with im-
paired functional status were more likely to develop de-
pressive symptoms than those with normal functional sta-
tus (24% vs 5%; OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3-8.5; P,.001).
Among the 7277 participants who had normal func-
tional status in 1988-1990, women with 6 or more de-
pressive symptoms had a mean (± SD) functional status
score of 5.2 ± 6.1 at follow-up, compared with 2.1 ± 4.3
in women with 5 or fewer depressive symptoms (P,.001);
those with 6 or more depressive symptoms were more
likely to develop impaired functional status than those
with 5 or fewer symptoms of depression (11% vs 3%; OR,
3.6; 95% CI, 2.4-5.3; P,.001). When added to the model
in Table 2, adjustment for functional status (as a con-
tinuous variable) appeared to attenuate but not elimi-
nate the association between depressive symptoms and
mortality (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02-1.69; P = .03).
Mortality rates in women with and without depres-
sion did not appear to diverge until approximately 16
months of follow-up (Figure 2). In models adjusted
for the variables listed in Table 2, women with depres-
sive symptoms had an 80% increased risk of cardiovas-
cular death and an 80% increased risk of noncancer,
Functional Status
To determine whether impaired functional status is an an-
tecedent of depressive symptoms (ie, potential cause of both
depression and mortality that should be adjusted for in the
primary analysis) or an effect of depressive symptoms (ie,
potential mechanism linking depressive symptoms and mor-
tality that should not be adjusted for in the primary analy-
sis), we measured functional status and depressive symp-
toms at 2 time points: at the 1988-1990 visit and again 4
years later.
Functional status was measured on a 39-point scale
with up to 3 points (some difficulty, much difficulty, or
unable to do) for each of 13 activities (eg, dressing, bath-
ing, preparing meals, doing housework, shopping, or walk-
ing 2 or 3 blocks) based on a modified version of the Stan-
ford Health Assessment Questionnaire.32 We defined
impaired functional status as a score of 14 or more be-
cause this number required that the respondent report much
difficulty with at least 1 of the 13 activities.
To ascertain whether impaired functional status pre-
cedes the development of depressive symptoms, we first ex-
cluded women who had 6 or more depressive symptoms
in 1988-1990, and then measured the incidence of depres-
sion (defined as a score $6 on the Geriatric Depression Scale
in 1992-1994), comparing women who had impaired func-
tional status in 1988-1990 with those who had normal func-
tional status at that time. To ascertain whether impaired
functional status is an effect of depressive symptoms, we
first excluded women who had impaired functional status
in 1988-1990, and then measured the incidence of im-
paired functional status (score $14) in the ensuing 4 years,
comparing women who had 6 or more depressive symp-
toms in 1988-1990 with those who had 5 or fewer symp-
toms at that time.
Mortality
Mortality was ascertained for an average of 6 years (range,
up to 7 years) following the initial depression measure. If
a participant died, we obtained a copy of the official death
certificate and hospital records, if available; the cause of
death was assigned by one of us (W.S.B.) who was
unaware of results from the Geriatric Depression Scale or
other predictor measurements. We used International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes33 to classify
death due to cardiovascular (codes 394-402, 410-414,
424-444, and 798), cancer (codes 141-238 and 259), or
noncancer, noncardiovascular cause. We specifically iden-
tified deaths from coronary heart disease (codes 410-414
and 429), cerebrovascular disease (codes 430-438), con-
gestive heart failure (code 425), sudden death (code 798),
lung cancer (codes 162-163), breast cancer (code 174),
colon cancer (codes 153-154), chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (codes 491-496), pneumonia (code 486),
accidents and trauma (codes 800-805, 852-994, and
E812-E890), and natural causes (code 799.9). Three
women who died from suicide were excluded from all
analyses.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Differences in baseline characteristics between women
with and without depression were compared using x2
tests for dichotomous variables and t tests for continu-
ous variables. The association between depressive symp-
toms and mortality was analyzed using proportional haz-
ards models. We used forward stepwise proportional
hazards regression to obtain adjusted risk estimates,
adding those variables associated with mortality (at
P,.05) to multivariate models that included depression.
We verified the proportionality assumption of these
models. The association between depressive symptoms
and functional status was analyzed using logistic regres-
sion. For all analyses, we report the hazard ratio (HR) or
odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Survival curves were estimated using an adjusted Cox
proportional hazards model.34 Analyses were performed
with the use of SAS statistical software (SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC).

noncardiovascular death, including a 3-fold increased
risk of death from chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease, but no increased risk of death from cancer
(Table 3).
COMMENT
Elderly women with 6 or more depressive symptoms had
a 47% increased adjusted risk of all-cause mortality, in-
cluding an 80% increased risk of dying of cardiovascu-
lar disease and noncancer, noncardiovascular disease,
compared with women who reported 5 or fewer symp-
toms of depression. This increased risk is similar to that
conferred by other cardiovascular risk factors, such as
hypertension, cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, obe-
sity, and diabetes.35 Mortality increased with number of
depressive symptoms, suggesting a dose-response rela-
tionship. Increased mortality in women with depres-
sion compared with women without depression did not
occur until approximately 16 months of follow-up, in-
dicating that depression is not simply a result of life-
threatening conditions.
Why would women with depressive symptoms
have increased mortality, and in particular increased
cardiovascular mortality? Several possible mechanisms
have been suggested. Electrocardiographic evidence of
myocardial ischemia during daily life has been demon-
strated in the hour following high levels of sadness,
suggesting that myocardial ischemia may be a direct
result of depressed mood.36 Depression has been iden-
tified as a predictor of hypertension,37 autonomic dys-
function as measured by higher plasma levels of nor-
epinephrine and reduced heart rate variability,38-45

increased platelet reactivity,46-48 and cardiovascular
events including myocardial infarction.6,11,22,24,49 Use of
psychotropic medications, such as antidepressants,
barbiturates, phenothiazines, and lithium, have been
associated with mortality, although most likely as
markers of depression rather than links in the pathway
between depression and mortality.11,50
We did not measure hyperlipidemia as a potential
risk factor for cardiovascular mortality among women
with depressive symptoms, but it is unlikely that hyper-
lipidemia would explain the association between
depressive symptoms and mortality because depression
is probably associated with low rather than high choles-
terol levels.51-53 Patients with depression are less likely
than patients without depression to adhere to pre-
scribed exercise therapy,54,55 and lack of exercise has
been associated with poor health outcomes.29,56,57 Our
analysis adjusted for self-reported physical activity,
but subsequent lack of exercise might have explained
the association between depression and mortality.
Decreased compliance with medications58 and lack of
social support among patients with depressive symp-
toms also may contribute to the association between
depressive symptoms and mortality.59-61
Another potential explanation is that the associa-
tion between depressive symptoms and mortality may
be partially confounded by impaired functional status.
Our findings suggest that impaired functional status is
both a cause and an effect of depression. To avoid over-
adjusting for the effects of depression in our primary
analysis, we adjusted for impaired functional status in
a separate analysis and found that the association
between depressive symptoms and mortality was some-
what attenuated. We cannot determine whether this
occurred because impaired functional status was a
cause of depressive symptoms or a result of depressive
symptoms that subsequently led to increased mortality.
Depressive symptoms could be a marker of other
illnesses that are associated with increased mortality.
If a greater prevalence of other illnesses explained the
association between depressive symptoms and mortal-
ity, however, we would expect that mortality rates
would diverge before 16 months of follow-up and that
depressive symptoms also would be associated with
increased cancer mortality. Prior studies62-64 have
yielded conflicting results regarding the possibility
that stressful life events and depression contribute to
the onset and progression of cancer, particularly breast
cancer. We found no increased risk of subsequent
death from cancer among women with depressive
symptoms.
Our findings differ from those of 2 prior studies21,22
that found no association between baseline depressive

symptoms and subsequent mortality. One study21 en-
rolled members of a health maintenance organization who
were younger than the participants in this study. The
other22enrolledpatients withhypertensionand found that,
although baseline depressive symptoms were not asso-
ciated with mortality, an increase in number of depres-
sive symptoms over time was associated with increased
mortality, including fatal stroke and fatal myocardial
infarction.
Several limitations deserve comment. First, only
80% of survivors from the initial cohort completed the
depression measure; women included in this analysis
may have been less depressed than those who did not
complete the depression measure. Second, although we
measured many potential confounding variables, the
association between depressive symptoms and mortality
may be influenced by unmeasured variables, such as
use of antidepressant medications or chronic medical
illnesses that were not identified by self-report. Third,
we measured depressive symptoms rather than per-
forming a clinical interview for depression; thus, we
must conclude that depressive symptoms, and not nec-
essarily the diagnosis of depression, are associated with
increased mortality. Fourth, cause of death may be mis-
classified due to the potential inaccuracies of death cer-
tificates. Finally, we studied only elderly white women,
whose characteristics may differ from those of other
populations.
CONCLUSIONS
Depression is a common and readily treatable condition
among older adults, but few receive appropriate treat-
ment.65 Depressive symptoms are associated with
increased cardiovascular and noncancer, noncardiovas-
cular mortality in older women. Although the effect of
treatment for depressive symptoms on mortality
remains to be determined, these findings suggest that
treatment for depression may not only enhance quality
of life but also reduce mortality among women with
depressive symptoms. We should redouble our efforts
to improve detection and treatment of depression.
