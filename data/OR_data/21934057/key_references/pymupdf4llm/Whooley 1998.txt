**Background: Major depression is associated with**
increased mortality, but it is not known whether
patients who report depressive symptoms have greater
mortality.

**Subjects and Methods: We performed a prospective**
cohort study of 7518 white women 67 years of age or older
who were recruited from population-based listings in Baltimore, Md, Minneapolis, Minn, Portland, Ore, and the
Monongahela Valley, Pa. Participants completed the Geriatric Depression Scale (short form) and were considered depressed if they reported 6 or more of 15 possible
symptoms of depression. Women were followed up for
an average of 6 years. If a participant died, we obtained
a copy of the official death certificate and hospital records, if available, and used International Classification
_of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes to classify death attrib-_
utable to cardiovascular, cancer, or noncancer, noncardiovascular cause.


up) compared with 11% of women who reported 5 or
fewer symptoms of depression (760 deaths in 41 460
woman-years of follow-up) (P�.001). Women with 6 or
more depressive symptoms had a 2-fold increased risk
of death (age-adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75-2.61; P�.001) compared with
those who had 5 or fewer depressive symptoms. This association remained strong after adjusting for potential confounding variables, including history of myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, perceived health,
and cognitive function (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.14-1.88;
_P = .003). Depressive symptoms were associated with_
an increased adjusted risk of death from cardiovascular
diseases (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.5; P = .003), and noncancer, noncardiovascular diseases (HR, 1.8; 95% CI,
1.2-2.7; P = .01), but were not associated with deaths from
cancer (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.7; P = .93).

**Conclusions: Depressive symptoms are a significant risk**
factor for cardiovascular and noncancer, noncardiovascular mortality but not cancer mortality in older women.
Whether depressive symptoms are a marker for, or a cause
of, life-threatening conditions remains to be determined.

### SUBJECTS AND METHODS

**SUBJECTS**

A total of 9704 ambulatory women at least 65 years of age
were recruited from population-based listings in Baltimore, Md, Minneapolis, Minn, Portland, Ore, and the
Monongahela Valley, Pa, between 1986 and 1988 for the
Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, a prospective cohort study
designed to determine risk factors for osteoporotic fractures. At a second visit (1988-1990), 7518 of these women
(80% of survivors) completed at least 10 of 15 items on the
Geriatric Depression Scale. These 7518 women are the subjects of this secondary data analysis. The study was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards, and
all subjects provided written informed consent.

**MEASUREMENTS**

**Depressive Symptoms**

At the second visit (1988-1990), we administered the Geriatric Depression Scale short form, a validated, reliable, 15item, self-report, depressive symptoms checklist designed to
detect the presence of current depression in the elderly.[25] Using a cutoff point of 6 or more symptoms, the Geriatric Depression Scale short form has a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 62% compared with a structured clinical interview
for depression.[26] We defined depression as 6 or more symptoms, with 6 to 7 symptoms indicating mild depression, 8
to 10 symptoms indicating moderate depression, and 11 or
more symptoms indicating severe depression.[27] For participants who failed to complete all 15 items, we calculated the
total number of depressive symptoms by dividing the reported number of symptoms by the proportion of items completed. To determine the effect of persistent depressive symptomsonsubsequentmortality,wealsoadministeredthesame
instrument 4 years later (1992-1994) to 5837 of the original 7518 women (83% of survivors).


**Other Measurements**

Self-reported age, marital status, education, medical history, current perceived health status (excellent/good vs
fair/poor/very poor), smoking, alcohol, and use of benzodiazepine, barbiturates, thiazide diuretics, and estrogen were determined from a questionnaire administered
at the first visit and reviewed by an interviewer. Systolic
and diastolic blood pressures were measured at the right
brachial artery using a standard protocol.[28] Hypertension
was defined as systolic blood pressure higher than 160
mm Hg, diastolic blood pressures higher than 90 mm
Hg, or use of a thiazide diuretic. We measured social
network by scoring answers to 11 questions regarding
contact with spouse, relatives, and friends, then adding
scores for the individual questions to create a total social
network score. Higher scores indicate better social network.
Physical activity was estimated using a modified Paffenbarger scale that assesses the type and duration of weightbearing activities in a variety of settings.[29] Participants were
asked about the frequency with which they performed each
of 40 activities at 4 time points during their lives (teenager, age 30 years, age 50 years, and previous year). For
each of the 4 time points, the number of times per year each
activity was performed was multiplied by 5.0 for lowintensity (eg, walking or gardening), 7.5 for mediumintensity (eg, dancing or tennis), or 10.0 for highintensity activities (eg, jogging or skiing). Scores for these
4 time points were added to calculate lifetime physical
activity.
At the second visit, weight was measured (in light indoor clothing with shoes removed) using a balance beam
scale, and height was measured using a stadiometer.[30] Body
mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by the square of the height in meters. Cognitive function
was measured by a trained examiner using Digit Symbol, a
subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.[31] Scores
on Digit Symbol reflect the number correct within the timed
trial; thus, lower scores indicate poorer performance.

sive symptoms (760 deaths in 41 460 woman-years of follow-up) (P�.001). Participants who subsequently died
had a mean (±SD) depression score of 2.6 ± 2.7, compared with 1.6 ± 2.1 in participants who were alive at follow-up (P�.001).
Women with 6 or more depressive symptoms had
a 2-fold increased risk of death (age-adjusted HR, 2.14;
95% CI, 1.75-2.61; P�.001) compared with those who
had 5 or fewer symptoms. This association remained
strong after adjusting for potential confounding variables (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.14-1.88; P = .003) (Table 2).
Each 1-symptom increase in number of depressive
symptoms was associated with a 6% increase in allcause mortality (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.10; P�.001),
adjusting for history of myocardial infarction, stroke,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, smoking, perceived health, and
cognitive function.
Of 473 women who had 6 or more depressive symptoms in 1988-1990, 297 completed the Geriatric Depression Scale short form again 4 years later, and 159 (53.5%)


**RESULTS**


The prevalence of depression (defined as a score �6 on
the Geriatric Depression Scale short form) was 6.3% (473/
7518). Compared with those who had 5 or fewer symptoms of depression, women with 6 or more symptoms
were older and more likely to smoke or to report fair or
poor health. They had a higher frequency of medical illnesses, worse functional status, and worse cognitive function. They were less likely to be married, well-educated,
or physically active (Table 1). Follow-up was complete in 7406 women (99%) who completed the depression scale. Of the 112 women lost to follow-up, 5.4% had
6 or more depressive symptoms. Mortality varied from
7% in women with no depressive symptoms to 17% in
those with 3 to 5 symptoms to 24% in those with 6 or
more symptoms of depression (P�.001 for trend)
(Figure 1).
Deaths occurred in 24% of women with 6 or more
depressive symptoms (111 deaths in 2610 woman-years
of follow-up) and 11% of women with 5 or fewer depres

**Functional Status**

To determine whether impaired functional status is an antecedent of depressive symptoms (ie, potential cause of both
depression and mortality that should be adjusted for in the
primary analysis) or an effect of depressive symptoms (ie,
potential mechanism linking depressive symptoms and mortality that should not be adjusted for in the primary analysis), we measured functional status and depressive symptoms at 2 time points: at the 1988-1990 visit and again 4
years later.
Functional status was measured on a 39-point scale
with up to 3 points (some difficulty, much difficulty, or
unable to do) for each of 13 activities (eg, dressing, bathing, preparing meals, doing housework, shopping, or walking 2 or 3 blocks) based on a modified version of the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire.[32] We defined
impaired functional status as a score of 14 or more because this number required that the respondent report much
difficulty with at least 1 of the 13 activities.
To ascertain whether impaired functional status precedes the development of depressive symptoms, we first excluded women who had 6 or more depressive symptoms
in 1988-1990, and then measured the incidence of depression (defined as a score �6 on the Geriatric Depression Scale
in 1992-1994), comparing women who had impaired functional status in 1988-1990 with those who had normal functional status at that time. To ascertain whether impaired
functional status is an effect of depressive symptoms, we
first excluded women who had impaired functional status
in 1988-1990, and then measured the incidence of impaired functional status (score �14) in the ensuing 4 years,
comparing women who had 6 or more depressive symptoms in 1988-1990 with those who had 5 or fewer symptoms at that time.

**Mortality**

Mortality was ascertained for an average of 6 years (range,
up to 7 years) following the initial depression measure. If

of 297 had persistent depressive symptoms. Death occurred in 11.3% of women with 6 or more depressive
symptoms at both time points (18 deaths in 971 womanyears of follow-up) and 4.3% of women with 5 or fewer
depressive symptoms at both time points (223 deaths in
32 232 woman-years of follow-up) (P�.001). Women
with persistent depressive symptoms had a 2.5-fold increased risk of death (age-adjusted HR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.564.09; P�.001) compared with those who reported 5 or
fewer symptoms at both time points, an association that
persisted but did not remain statistically significant after adjusting for the variables listed in Table 2 (HR, 1.63;
95% CI, 0.86-3.07; P = .13).
We found that depressive symptoms are both a cause
and an effect of impaired functional status. Among the
7045 participants who had 5 or fewer depressive symptoms in 1988-1990, those with impaired functional status (n = 172) had a mean (± SD) depression score of 3.5
± 2.8 at follow-up compared with 1.6 ± 1.9 in women
with normal functional status (P�.001); women with impaired functional status were more likely to develop de

a participant died, we obtained a copy of the official death
certificate and hospital records, if available; the cause of
death was assigned by one of us (W.S.B.) who was
unaware of results from the Geriatric Depression Scale or
other predictor measurements. We used International
_Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes[33]_ to classify
death due to cardiovascular (codes 394-402, 410-414,
424-444, and 798), cancer (codes 141-238 and 259), or
noncancer, noncardiovascular cause. We specifically identified deaths from coronary heart disease (codes 410-414
and 429), cerebrovascular disease (codes 430-438), congestive heart failure (code 425), sudden death (code 798),
lung cancer (codes 162-163), breast cancer (code 174),
colon cancer (codes 153-154), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (codes 491-496), pneumonia (code 486),
accidents and trauma (codes 800-805, 852-994, and
E812-E890), and natural causes (code 799.9). Three
women who died from suicide were excluded from all
analyses.

**STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**

Differences in baseline characteristics between women
with and without depression were compared using �[2]
tests for dichotomous variables and t tests for continuous variables. The association between depressive symptoms and mortality was analyzed using proportional hazards models. We used forward stepwise proportional
hazards regression to obtain adjusted risk estimates,
adding those variables associated with mortality (at
_P�.05) to multivariate models that included depression._
We verified the proportionality assumption of these
models. The association between depressive symptoms
and functional status was analyzed using logistic regression. For all analyses, we report the hazard ratio (HR) or
odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Survival curves were estimated using an adjusted Cox
proportional hazards model.[34] Analyses were performed
with the use of SAS statistical software (SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC).

pressive symptoms than those with normal functional status (24% vs 5%; OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3-8.5; P�.001).
Among the 7277 participants who had normal functional status in 1988-1990, women with 6 or more depressive symptoms had a mean (± SD) functional status
score of 5.2 ± 6.1 at follow-up, compared with 2.1 ± 4.3
in women with 5 or fewer depressive symptoms (P�.001);
those with 6 or more depressive symptoms were more
likely to develop impaired functional status than those
with 5 or fewer symptoms of depression (11% vs 3%; OR,
3.6; 95% CI, 2.4-5.3; P�.001). When added to the model
in Table 2, adjustment for functional status (as a continuous variable) appeared to attenuate but not eliminate the association between depressive symptoms and
mortality (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02-1.69; P = .03).
Mortality rates in women with and without depression did not appear to diverge until approximately 16
months of follow-up (Figure 2). In models adjusted
for the variables listed in Table 2, women with depressive symptoms had an 80% increased risk of cardiovascular death and an 80% increased risk of noncancer,

**COMMENT**


Elderly women with 6 or more depressive symptoms had
a 47% increased adjusted risk of all-cause mortality, including an 80% increased risk of dying of cardiovascular disease and noncancer, noncardiovascular disease,
compared with women who reported 5 or fewer symptoms of depression. This increased risk is similar to that
conferred by other cardiovascular risk factors, such as
hypertension, cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and diabetes.[35] Mortality increased with number of
depressive symptoms, suggesting a dose-response relationship. Increased mortality in women with depression compared with women without depression did not
occur until approximately 16 months of follow-up, indicating that depression is not simply a result of lifethreatening conditions.

symptoms in 7518 elderly women. Bars represent 95% confidence intervals.
P�.001 for trend.

Why would women with depressive symptoms
have increased mortality, and in particular increased
cardiovascular mortality? Several possible mechanisms
have been suggested. Electrocardiographic evidence of
myocardial ischemia during daily life has been demonstrated in the hour following high levels of sadness,
suggesting that myocardial ischemia may be a direct
result of depressed mood.[36] Depression has been identified as a predictor of hypertension,[37] autonomic dysfunction as measured by higher plasma levels of norepinephrine and reduced heart rate variability,[38-45]

increased platelet reactivity,[46-48] and cardiovascular
events including myocardial infarction.[6,11,22,24,49] Use of
psychotropic medications, such as antidepressants,
barbiturates, phenothiazines, and lithium, have been
associated with mortality, although most likely as
markers of depression rather than links in the pathway
between depression and mortality.[11,50]
We did not measure hyperlipidemia as a potential
risk factor for cardiovascular mortality among women
with depressive symptoms, but it is unlikely that hyperlipidemia would explain the association between
depressive symptoms and mortality because depression
is probably associated with low rather than high cholesterol levels.[51-53] Patients with depression are less likely
than patients without depression to adhere to prescribed exercise therapy,[54,55] and lack of exercise has
been associated with poor health outcomes.[29,56,57] Our
analysis adjusted for self-reported physical activity,
but subsequent lack of exercise might have explained
the association between depression and mortality.

‡Adjusted for age, history of myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, perceived
health, and cognitive function.

Decreased compliance with medications[58] and lack of
social support among patients with depressive symptoms also may contribute to the association between
depressive symptoms and mortality.[59-61]
Another potential explanation is that the association between depressive symptoms and mortality may
be partially confounded by impaired functional status.
Our findings suggest that impaired functional status is
both a cause and an effect of depression. To avoid overadjusting for the effects of depression in our primary
analysis, we adjusted for impaired functional status in
a separate analysis and found that the association
between depressive symptoms and mortality was somewhat attenuated. We cannot determine whether this
occurred because impaired functional status was a
cause of depressive symptoms or a result of depressive
symptoms that subsequently led to increased mortality.
Depressive symptoms could be a marker of other
illnesses that are associated with increased mortality.
If a greater prevalence of other illnesses explained the
association between depressive symptoms and mortality, however, we would expect that mortality rates
would diverge before 16 months of follow-up and that
depressive symptoms also would be associated with
increased cancer mortality. Prior studies[62-64] have
yielded conflicting results regarding the possibility
that stressful life events and depression contribute to
the onset and progression of cancer, particularly breast
cancer. We found no increased risk of subsequent
death from cancer among women with depressive
symptoms.
Our findings differ from those of 2 prior studies[21,22]

Several limitations deserve comment. First, only
80% of survivors from the initial cohort completed the
depression measure; women included in this analysis
may have been less depressed than those who did not
complete the depression measure. Second, although we
measured many potential confounding variables, the
association between depressive symptoms and mortality
may be influenced by unmeasured variables, such as
use of antidepressant medications or chronic medical
illnesses that were not identified by self-report. Third,
we measured depressive symptoms rather than performing a clinical interview for depression; thus, we
must conclude that depressive symptoms, and not necessarily the diagnosis of depression, are associated with
increased mortality. Fourth, cause of death may be misclassified due to the potential inaccuracies of death certificates. Finally, we studied only elderly white women,
whose characteristics may differ from those of other
populations.


**CONCLUSIONS**


Depression is a common and readily treatable condition
among older adults, but few receive appropriate treatment.[65] Depressive symptoms are associated with
increased cardiovascular and noncancer, noncardiovascular mortality in older women. Although the effect of
treatment for depressive symptoms on mortality
remains to be determined, these findings suggest that
treatment for depression may not only enhance quality
of life but also reduce mortality among women with
depressive symptoms. We should redouble our efforts
to improve detection and treatment of depression.
