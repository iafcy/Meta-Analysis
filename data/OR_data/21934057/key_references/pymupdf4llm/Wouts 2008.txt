**Context: Previous research suggests that depression is**
a risk factor for stroke. However, the reliability of much
research is limited by the lack of documentation on the
presence of preexistent cardiovascular disease and by the
use of limited measures of depression or stroke.

**Objectives: To test the hypotheses that (1) clinically**
relevant depressive symptoms are an independent risk
factor of incident stroke in cardiac and noncardiac patients and (2) more chronic and severe depressive symptoms are associated with incident stroke.

**Design: A cohort of elderly Dutch people (aged �** 55
years) was followed up for 9 years in the Longitudinal
Aging Study Amsterdam (baseline measurements were
taken in 1992 or 1993, and the study concluded in 2001
or 2002, respectively).

**Setting: General community.**

**Participants: Randomly selected population-based**
sample (N=2965) without a history of stroke.


miological Studies–Depression Scale. Multivariate Cox
proportional hazards regression analyses of stroke incidence were performed. The association of the chronicity and severity of depressive symptoms was studied in
extended models with time-dependent variables.

**Results: The sample’s mean (SD) age was 70.5 (8.7) years,**
52.1% were women, and the mean (SD) follow-up was
7.7 (3.1) years. Inclusion of an interaction between cardiac disease and clinically relevant depressive symptoms improved the model for stroke (P =.03). In participants with preexistent cardiac disease, but not in
participants without cardiac disease, clinically relevant
depressive symptoms at baseline (hazard ratio [HR], 2.18;
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-4.09) and the severity (range, 0-60; HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13) and chronicity (HR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.13-10.93) of symptoms during follow-up were associated with stroke.

**Conclusions: Preexistent cardiac disease moderates the**
association between depressive symptoms and incident
stroke. In cardiac patients, baseline depressive symptoms and both the severity and chronicity of symptoms
during follow-up are associated with incident stroke.

-----

In a recent meta-analysis, the pooled relative risk of stroke
in those with a depressed mood was 1.4 (range, 1.21.8), but this estimated risk was influenced by the methodologic shortcomings and heterogeneity of the studies
included. In particular, most of the early studies used limited measures of depression, with only 2 using the DSM-IV
to diagnose depression. The first of these studies used
self-reported data on the occurrence of stroke, and the
second used physician-reported ICD-10–classified cardiovascular disease.[10,11] Neither study documented the
chronicity and severity of depression. Another source of
heterogeneity in studies of the relationship between depressive symptoms and stroke is the possible moderating effect of cardiac disease. Because cardiac disease is
an important predictor of stroke, stratifying by cardiac
disease divides the population into low- and high-risk
populations. If one assumes that the pathophysiologic
mechanisms are comparable to those leading to cardiovascular disease in depressed individuals, depression in
cardiac patients could aggravate the existing atherosclerotic disease, ultimately leading to stroke. Furthermore,
the prevalence and incidence of depression would be expected to be higher in cardiac patients based on the vascular depression hypothesis, which states that subclinical underlying cerebrovascular disease may cause
depression.[12-16] According to this hypothesis, underlying atherosclerotic disease could give rise to both stroke
and depression in cardiac patients. Bearing in mind
these sources of heterogeneity in earlier studies, we investigated whether the presence, severity, and chronicity of depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder (MDD) are independently associated with incident
stroke in elderly patients with or without cardiac disease during a 9-year follow-up.


**METHODS**


**STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION**

This study was conducted within the Longitudinal Aging Study
Amsterdam(LASA),whichisaprospectivecohortstudyofDutch
people aged 55 to 85 years. The LASA started in 1992, and its
methods have been described in detail elsewhere.[17,18] The general aim of LASA was to study the autonomy and well-being of
an aging population. A randomly selected age- and sexstratified sample (according to expected mortality figures) was
drawn from the population registers of 11 municipalities in the
Netherlands. The reason for this relative oversampling of older
old people (both men and women) and elderly men was to compensate for an anticipated higher unavailability for follow-up
among physically frail people. The initial response rate was
62.3%, and nonresponse was associated with age, sex, and urbanicity. The sample first took part in the cross-sectional
NESTOR–living arrangements and social networks study[19] and
was later interviewed and followed up every 3 years in LASA;
81.7% of the NESTOR–living arrangements and social networks study population participated in LASA, with nonresponse being related to age but not to sex. All interviews were
recorded for quality control purposes. All LASA participants
without a history of stroke at the baseline measurement were
eligible for inclusion (n=3018).
Participants in whom depressive symptoms (51 [1.6%]) or
stroke (2 [0.06%]) were not evaluated at baseline were excluded. The remaining 2965 individuals participated in this study


of the association among depressive symptoms, CRDSs, or MDD
at baseline and incident stroke in patients with or without cardiac disease at baseline. The mean (SD) follow-up was 7.7 (3.1)
years; participants were assessed at baseline and every 3 years.
For the extended Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, we required the availability of a baseline and at least 1 follow-up assessment of depression. In total, 412 participants
(13.9%) were excluded because they had died or had a stroke
before the first follow-up interview, and 328 participants
(11.1%) were excluded because they never had a follow-up assessment of depressive symptoms. Unavailablity for follow-up
of depressive symptoms was associated with an older age, a lower
score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), more
functional limitations, and cardiac disease (P�.001 for all). The
mean (SD) follow-up for the remaining 2225 participants was
9.1 (1.7) years, with a mean (SD) number of 3.4 (0.8) measurements of depressive symptoms.

**MEASUREMENTS**

**Stroke Morbidity and Mortality**

The study end point was the first occurrence of stroke (fatal or
nonfatal). Nonfatal strokes were established based on selfreport during the 3-yearly interviews and information obtained from general practitioners (GPs) in response to questionnaires sent in 1992-1993, 1995-1996, and 2000-2001. The
GPs were asked whether a participant had ever been diagnosed as having a cerebrovascular accident, the year in which
it occurred, and whether a specialist had confirmed the diagnosis. Previous research in LASA had shown such selfreported information to be moderately accurate (concordance
with GP: �=0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.64).[20]
Therefore, we considered a stroke to have occurred if the selfreported and GP information were consistent or if a cardiac specialist confirmed the GP diagnosis of stroke. Death due to stroke
was established based on death certificates registered by the
Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics. Death certificates of
deceased participants were 100% complete. Stroke was defined as ICD-9 codes 431, 433, 434, and 436 and ICD-10 codes
I-61, I-63, and I-64. The event was timed as occurring in the
year halfway between the 3-yearly assessments for nonfatal
strokes and as the year of death for fatal strokes.

**Depression**

Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression Scale (CES-D). This is a widely
used instrument to measure depressive symptoms in the community.[21] In LASA, the traditional cutoff of the CES-D of 16 or
greater had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% for
MDD.[22] Major depressive disorder was diagnosed using the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS).[23] Subthreshold depressive disorder (SDD) was diagnosed if a study participant scored 16 or higher on the CES-D
but did not meet DSM-III diagnostic criteria for MDD on the
DIS. The SDD category included 107 respondents with a CES-D
score of 16 or higher but no available DIS diagnosis. We use
the term CRDSs were refer to the broad category of MDD or
SDD, and we use the term depressive symptoms to refer to the
score on the CES-D (range, 0-60).
TheDISandCES-Dwerecompletedevery3years,whichmade
it possible to estimate the mean severity of depressive symptoms
and the chronicity of CRDSs and MDD during the follow-up. The
mean severity of depressive symptoms was defined as the mean
CES-D score of all observations until the year of the first stroke
or censoring divided by the total number of observations in this

**Cardiac Disease**

_Cardiac disease was defined as myocardial infarction, conges-_
tive heart failure, angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia and
established at baseline using an algorithm used earlier in LASA.[6]
Thisalgorithmuses3sourcesofinformation:self-reported,medication, and GP information. We considered only 1 confirmative source necessary for diagnosis because self-reported cardiac disease is sufficiently accurate in LASA (concordance with
GP: �=0.69; 95% CI, 0.65-0.73).[20] We used a broad definition
of cardiac disease because although it could lead to a type II
error (overcorrection), the use of a more restricted definition
could lead to a type I error (undercorrection), and we preferred to use the broader category.

**Confounders**

Sociodemographic variables (sex and age), general healthrelated variables (functional limitations and cognitive impairments), and important stroke risk factors (diabetes mellitus,
smoking, hypertension, and obesity) were included in the analyses as potential confounders. The number of functional limitations was scored with a 3-item questionnaire[24] as none, 1, or
2 or more. Cognitive impairments were measured with the
MMSE.[25] A history of diabetes mellitus was considered present if reported by the respondent, if the person used antidiabetic agents, or if a GP confirmed the diagnosis. The variable
smoking included current smoking. Blood pressure was measured every 3 years, preferably from the arm but otherwise from
the fingertip. Hypertension was categorized into stage 1 hypertension (a mean systolic blood pressure of 140-159 mm Hg
or a mean diastolic blood pressure of 90-99 mm Hg) and stage
2 hypertension (a mean systolic blood pressure of �160 mm Hg
or a mean diastolic blood pressure of �100 mm Hg).[26] Obesity was defined as a body mass index (calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30 or


greater. Antidepressant use was established by asking about
the use of medication and by visually checking all of the participants’ medications at each 3-yearly assessment.

**STATISTICAL ANALYSES**

All primary variables and covariates were checked for normality, colinearity, and proportionality of hazards. Missing data for
covariates were restored by imputation of the most reported
value, and the results for analyses with or without imputed data
were checked for differences.[28] Baseline characteristics for participants with or without depressive symptoms were compared using �[2] and t tests. Univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses of first strokes were conducted for primary and
secondary variables. Models of stroke incidence, which included interaction terms of depression variables (depressive
symptoms, CRDSs, and MDD) by cardiac disease status, were
tested by multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. Subsequently, the sample was stratified for cardiac disease, and the relationship between depression variables and incident stroke was examined by multivariate Cox proportional
hazard regression analysis. We used extended Cox proportional hazard models to examine the association between the
severity of depressive symptoms or the chronicity of CRDSs or
MDD and incident stroke, with these depression variables and
possible confounders as time-dependent variables.[29]


**BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS**

The mean (SD) age of the 2965 elderly study participants (52.1% female) was 70.5 (8.7) years, and 39.6%
had 1 or more functional limitations (Table 1). At baseline, 58 (2.0%) had MDD and 372 (12.5%) had SDD. Myocardial infarction was reported in 285 (9.6%), congestive heart failure in 256 (8.7%), angina pectoris in
283 (9.5%), and cardiac arrhythmia in 132 (4.4%). The
CRDSs at baseline were associated with older age
(P � .001), female sex (P � .001), more functional limitations (P � .001), poorer performance on the MMSE
(P�.001), smoking (P=.04), diabetes mellitus (P=.03),
and cardiac disease (P � .001).
The overall rate of stroke was 7.7 per 1000 personyears: the rate of first nonfatal stroke was 2.8 per 1000 person-years, and the rate of fatal stroke was 4.9 per 1000 person-years. The rate of incident stroke was higher, but not
significantly so, among participants with CRDSs at baseline (P=.10), as shown in Table 2. On univariate analysis, cardiac disease at baseline (P � .001), older age
(P�.001),poorerMMSEperformance(P�.01),morefunctionallimitations(P�.01),diabetesmellitus(P�.001),and
hypertension (P�.001) were associated with a higher incidence of stroke. The use of antidepressants (49 participants[1.7%])wasnotassociatedwithincidentstroke(hazard ratio [HR], 0.35; 95% CI, 0.05-2.52; P=.30).

Stratification of the sample into those with or without
cardiac disease at baseline showed that in patients with
cardiac disease the presence of CRDSs at baseline was associated with a higher incidence of stroke even after correction for possible confounders (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.174.09; P =.02) (Table 3).
The extended multivariate Cox proportional hazards
regression model for first stroke included timedependent depression variables (the mean severity of depressive symptoms, the chronicity of CRDSs, and the chronicity of MDD), possible confounders measured at
baseline, and changes in hypertension or functional limitations during the follow-up period. The chronicity of
CRDSs during follow-up was an independent predictor
of incident stroke (HR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.13-10.93; P=.03).
The chronicity of MDD was not significantly associated
with incident stroke (HR, 5.59; 95% CI, 0.77-40.56;
_P=.09). In addition, the mean severity of depressive symp-_
toms during follow-up was significantly associated with
an incident stroke (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13; P=.005).
Results were similar for men and women, and correction for cardiac medication did not significantly influence the associations found.
The CRDSs at baseline were not significantly associated with incident stroke in patients without cardiac disease at baseline (Table 3) and neither were the chronicity of CRDSs nor the mean severity of symptoms during
follow-up.

**COMMENT**


This study shows that cardiac disease moderates the association between CRDSs and incident stroke. In cardiac patients, there seemed to be a dose-response effect
in that both the severity and the chronicity of depressive symptoms during follow-up were predictors of incident stroke. This relationship was not observed in patients without cardiac disease at baseline.
Our findings are in line with previous research of the
relationship between depressive symptoms and the incidence of stroke in populations with a high cardiovascular risk, such as patients with hypertension or diabetes mellitus,[30-32] and offer an explanation for negative
results. They are also consistent with previous studies[12,33,34] reporting a poorer cardiac prognosis and an increased mortality among cardiac patients with depression. Our study shows that the cerebrovascular prognosis
of cardiac patients with depressive symptoms is worse,
as is the cardiac prognosis, and this may be a factor underlying the higher mortality seen in depressed cardiac
patients.

Nevertheless, these findings have some limitations.
First, stroke was not confirmed by neuroimaging and,
thus, no distinction was made between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Pathophysiologically, depression would
be expected to be primarily associated with ischemic
stroke. Misclassification due to overreporting of stroke
is probably not a major issue because self-reported stroke
had to be confirmed by a GP or a specialist. Although
there was selective dropout, with the more frail individuals being more likely to have missing data on depression during follow-up, this would tend to lead to a
conservative estimate of the relationship between depressive symptoms and incident stroke. The relatively few
participants with an MDD at baseline (n=58) limited the
power to find associations between MDD and stroke. However, the use of a broader category of CRDSs, which included MDD and SDD, is in line with research showing
that subsyndromal depressive states form a continuum
with major depression in elderly populations.[35-37] Furthermore, the strongest results were found when depressive symptoms were used as a continuous measure (based
on the CES-D), and the results for time-dependent analysis of an association between MDD and stroke in cardiac
patients pointed in the same direction. Last, we did not
fully control for the severity of cardiac disease because
of the lack of electrocardiographic or ultrasonographic
information.[12]
As strong points, we used a clinical diagnosis of depression in combination with a valid measurement of
depressive symptoms and required confirmation of selfreported stroke by the patients’ GPs, a method that has
been validated in LASA,[20] or by information obtained
from the death certificate. We also assessed depressive
disorders and symptoms, functional limitations, and
blood pressure during follow-up, which enabled us to
use adjusted extended Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent variables. These extended
models are probably more realistic because depression
has a fluctuating course, and these models incorporate
all available information about depression and depressive symptoms. We also distinguished between participants with and without cardiac disease at baseline,
which enabled us to establish that cardiac disease mod

erates the relationship between stroke and depressive
symptoms.
To understand how cardiac disease moderates the
association between depression and stroke morbidity
and mortality, we initially have to consider why depression is associated with incident stroke in cardiac
patients. Depression could aggravate atherosclerosis
and in this way worsen the prognosis of cardiac
patients, which could explain the dose-response effect
that we found. Suggested pathways by which depression could specifically affect the vascular system of cardiac patients are a diminished heart rate variability,
altered platelet responses, [8] more arrhythmia in
depressed patients with premature ventricular contractions,[38] as well as behavioral pathways, such as poorer
compliance with cardiac treatment and a less healthy
lifestyle.[39] At the same time, the vascular depression
hypothesis suggests that subclinical underlying cerebrovascular disease can cause depression in cardiac patients.[13] The relationship between depression and vascular diseases seems to be reciprocal.[40,41] This reciprocal
relationship could be synergistic in cardiac patients but
not in patients without cardiac disease. This would
explain the interaction between cardiac disease and depression found in our study.
An alternative explanation for our findings is that depressive symptoms are an indicator of a poor prognosis in
cardiac patients because the number of depressive symptoms is (partly) associated with the severity of underlying
cardiovasculardisease.[42] WechosetousetheCES-Dtoscore
depressive symptoms because, when LASA was designed,
studies showed that the overlap with physical illness was
limited.[43,44] A more recent study[45] of patients undergoing
cardiac surgery showed that the CES-D detected change
after this intervention, not only shortly after surgery but
also later during follow-up, which suggests that depressive symptoms, as measured with the CES-D, benefit from
an improvement in cardiovascular status. Moreover, trials
of antidepressants in depressed patients after myocardial
infarction do not consistently report less long-term depression or a better cardiac prognosis, which suggests that depressive symptoms may in part be due to the severity of
the underlying cardiac disease.[46-49]


-----

In conclusion, cardiac disease moderates the association between CRDSs and incident stroke. This moderating effect of cardiac disease could be explained not only
by a synergistic effect of the reciprocal mechanisms between vascular disease and depression but also by depressive symptoms being an indicator of the severity of
underlying cardiac disease. Both explanations deserve
more attention in further research because they have implications for targeting effective interventions. At least,
depression in cardiac patients seems to be an indicator
of a poorer prognosis to some extent because of the higher
incidence of stroke among these patients, as this study
showed.
