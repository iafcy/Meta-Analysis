# Psychological distress, major depressive disorder, and risk of stroke

**ABSTRACT**

**Background: Studies have suggested that mood status is associated with an increased risk of**
stroke, though mostly based on measures of depression defined by symptoms alone rather than
diagnostic criteria representative of clinically important distress and impairment. We investigated
this association based upon a large population-based prospective cohort study.

**Methods: Baseline assessment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and of mental health well-**
being (defined by the Mental Health Inventory, MHI-5) was completed by 20,627 stroke-free
participants, aged 41 to 80 years, in the United Kingdom European Prospective Investigation into
Cancer–Norfolk study.

**Results: During 8.5 years of follow-up, 595 incident (fatal and nonfatal) stroke endpoints were**
recorded. Neither past year nor lifetime MDD was associated with stroke. A one SD decrease in
MHI-5 scale score (representing greater emotional distress) was associated with an 11% increased risk of stroke after adjustment for age, sex, cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure,
cholesterol, obesity, preexisting myocardial infarction, diabetes, social class, education, hypertension treatment, family history of stroke, and antidepressant medication use (hazard ratio 1.11,
95% CI 1.00 to 1.22). This association was consistent for men and for women, for fatal and
nonfatal stroke, and conformed to a dose-response relationship.

**Conclusions: Findings from this large prospective cohort study suggest that increased psycholog-**
ical distress is associated with elevated stroke risk. Episodic major depressive disorder was not
associated with incident stroke in this study. Neurology[®] **2008;70:788–794**

### During the past decade, research has focused on increasing understanding of the bidirec- tional association between depression and stroke. Results from stroke survivor,[1,2] regis- ter,[3] and population-based[4] studies have suggested that depression commonly occurs following stroke, necessitates increased need for poststroke healthcare, is associated with an increased risk of suicide, particularly in women and in younger age groups, and fol- lowing control for vascular and other risk factors, is associated with increased stroke incidence. However, the evidence that depression may confer increased risk of incident stroke is controversial.[5,6] This follows from study limitations imposed by cohort size and endpoint rarity,[7,8] by restriction to special study groups,[9] by limited capacity to adjust for stroke

### universal reliance on general measures of mental health status defined by symptom count alone rather than by depressive dis- order diagnostic criteria that require recog- nition (for example) of evidence of a sustained period of clinically important distress and impairment.[4,9,11,12]
 To advance understanding of the ori- gin of the suggested association between depression and stroke, and to consider the clinical implications of such an asso- ciation, evidence is needed, based upon large population-based prospective healthy (stroke-free) cohort studies, that include assessment of depressive disorder defined by diagnostic criteria. Based on data collected within the United King- dom European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)–Norfolk population- based prospective cohort study,[13] we evaluated the association between mea- sures of general mental health well-being and of depressive disorder and incident fatal and nonfatal stroke, independent of cerebrovascular risk factors, for both men and women.

**METHODS Participants and measures. Residents of**
Norfolk (UK) were recruited during 1993–1997 into the
United Kingdom European Prospective Investigation into
Cancer (EPIC)–Norfolk study using general practice agesex registers.[13] Baseline assessment included details of preexisting physician diagnosed diabetes, myocardial
infarction (MI), and stroke, cigarette smoking behavior,
hypertension treatment, family history of stroke, education, and social class. Social class was classified according
to the Registrar General’s occupation-based social classification scheme, namely social class I (professionals), social class II (includes managerial and technical
occupations), social class III (subdivided into nonmanual
and manual skilled workers), social class IV (partly skilled
workers), and social class V (unskilled workers). A subsequent health check attendance included assessment of systolic blood pressure (SBP in mm Hg), based on the mean
of two readings taken by trained nurses (after each study
participant had been seated for 5 minutes), and body mass
index (BMI), determined according to the Quetelet Index
(weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared).
Non-fasting blood samples taken by venipuncture enabled
estimation of serum total cholesterol using an RA 1000
Technicon analyzer (Bayer Diagnostics, Basingstoke,
UK). The study was approved by the Norwich District
Health Authority Ethics Committee, and all participants
gave signed informed consent. See references[13,14] for further details of study design and participant assessments


EPIC Norfolk) participants, aged 41 to 80 years, completed
the Health and Life Experiences Questionnaire (HLEQ), an
assessment of psychosocial circumstances, that included a
representation of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV)[15] criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder
(GAD). The assessment was designed to identify those participants thought likely to have met a putative diagnosis of
MDD at any time in their lives. Where any episode was reported, participants were asked also to estimate onset and (if
appropriate) offset timings. Twelve-month MDD and 12month GAD were defined as any episode that was either
current at HLEQ completion or ended within 1 year of questionnaire assessment.[16,17] The HLEQ also included a fiveitem version of the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5), with
one or more items representing anxiety, depression, loss of
behavioral/emotional control, and psychological well-being
during the past 4 weeks, as part of a validated generic measure
of subjective health status, the anglicized version of the Short
Form 36 (SF-36).[18] The MHI-5, originally developed as a measure of well-being and psychological distress,[19] has been shown
to be an effective measure of depression severity,[20-22] and to be a
valid measure of MDD (among functionally impaired,
community-dwelling elderly).[23] Recent antidepressant medication use was assessed through a questionnaire completed approximately 6 months prior to the HLEQ.
Participants with a history of stroke at EPIC baseline and
those who were admitted to hospital with a stroke between
EPIC baseline and HLEQ completion were excluded, leaving
a sample 20,627 (of 20,921) HLEQ participants for analysis.
Stroke morbidity and mortality among EPIC-Norfolk participants to July 31, 2006, was classified according to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)
codes 430–438 or according to International Classification
of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) as codes I60–I69. Attending physicians assigned diagnostic codes for stroke
events resulting in hospital admission. Nonfatal stroke was
defined as hospital admission due to stroke that did not result in death (due to stroke in the same month), and any
stroke was taken as the first occurrence of either hospital
admission or death due to stroke.

**Statistical analysis. Analyses were implemented in Stata**
version 8.2.[24] The associations among 12-month MDD,
MHI-5, and any stroke, fatal stroke, and nonfatal stroke
were investigated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results are presented by sex and for men and women
combined as hazard ratios for 12-month MDD, and as hazard ratios for a 1 SD decrease in MHI-5 score (representing
greater psychological distress), with adjustment for age (in 5
year bands) and sex, and subsequently for cigarette smoking
(current, former, never), SBP (included as a continuous measure), total cholesterol, obesity (BMI � 30), preexisting MI,
diabetes, social class (I, II, III nonmanual, III manual, IV, V),
education (no qualifications, to age 16, to age 18, degree
level), hypertension treatment (yes, no), family history of
stroke (yes, no), and recent antidepressant medication use
(yes, no). Sex differences were tested through inclusion of
interaction terms. In addition, the presence of a doseresponse relation between MHI-5 score and stroke was investigated through inclusion of MHI-5 as a categorical
variable recoded into quintiles (score ranges 0 to 63, 64 to 75,
76 to 83 84 to 91 92 to 100)

**RESULTS Of 20,627 study participants aged be-**
tween 41 and 80 years, 8,939 were men and 11,688
were women. Of these 1,083 (5.3%) reported episodes of MDD within 12 months of HLEQ assessment (336 [3.8%] for men and 747 [6.4%] for
women, p � 0.001 for test of difference by sex),
and 3,184 (15.4%) reported episodes of MDD at
any time in their lives (1,012 [11.3%] for men and
2,172 [18.6%] for women, p � 0.001). Mean
MHI-5 score was 76.9 (SD � 16.4), 78.9 (15.8) for
men and 75.4 (16.6) for women (p � 0.001 for test
of difference by sex), and was 55.2 (20.3) for participants who reported an episode of MDD in the
past 12 months, 76.5 (14.4) for those who reported episodes of MDD in their lifetime (that
was not in the past 12 months), and 78.5 (15.2) for
participants who reported no episodes of MDD at
any time in their lives. During a total of 170,593
(median 8.5) person-years of follow-up, 595 incident stroke endpoints were recorded (277 among
men and 318 among women). Of these, 167 were
fatal and 491 were hospital admissions (with 63
participants admitted to hospital and subsequently dying from stroke). Figure 1 shows the
distribution of MHI-5 scores, and table 1 shows
the number and percentage of participants reporting 12-month MDD according to stroke endpoints.
Table 2 shows prevalence rates of 12-month
MDD and mean MHI-5 scores according to cerebrovascular risk factors and antidepressant medication use. Twelve-month prevalence rates of
MDD were higher and MHI-5 scores were lower
(representing greater psychological distress) for
younger than for older participants (both p �

12-month MDD were higher and MHI-5 scores
were lower (representing greater psychological
distress) for participants who were current cigarette smokers, were obese, had previously had an

sion treatment, and reported recent antidepressant medication use. Additionally, participants
reported greater psychological distress (lower
MHI-5 scores) if they had previously been diagnosed with diabetes, had higher total blood cholesterol, or had a lower level of educational
attainment.
Table 3 shows that no association was observed between 12-month MDD and incident (fatal and nonfatal) stroke (hazard ratio 1.08 [95%
CI 0.67, 1.75] after adjusting for age, sex, cigarette smoking, SBP, total cholesterol, obesity

[BMI � 30], preexisting MI, diabetes, social class,
education, hypertension treatment, family history
of stroke, and antidepressant medication use). In
addition, no association was observed between
lifetime MDD and (any fatal or nonfatal) stroke
(hazard ratio 1.13 [95% CI 0.85, 1.50]), and no
association was observed between either 12month (0.81 [0.33, 1.98]) or lifetime GAD (0.58

[0.27, 1.24]) and (any fatal or nonfatal) stroke,
with all adjustments as above.
Table 4 shows that a 1 SD decrease in MHI-5
scale score (representing greater psychological
distress) was associated with an 11% increased
risk of incident stroke after adjusting for all risk
factors (as above). This association was consistent for men and for women (p � 0.46 for sex
interaction), and was more pronounced for fatal
than for nonfatal stroke endpoints. Figure 2
shows that this association conformed to a doseresponse relationship with the risk of stroke progressively greater for participants reporting
increased psychological distress. Table 5 shows

and there was no evidence of nonproportional

**DISCUSSION Based on data from 20,627 initially**
stroke-free participants in the EPIC-Norfolk
study, we found no evidence that episodic mood
state as defined by diagnostic criteria was associated with incident stroke. In contrast, we found
evidence that a more general measure of current
mental health well-being was associated with increased risk of incident stroke in men and in
women and independently of known cerebrovascular risk factors. This association conformed to
a dose-response relation and did not attenuate
with increasing length of follow-up.
This large community-based population study
has a number of strengths including prospective
determination of endpoints through death certification and hospital record linkage for all study
participants (with 167 fatal and 491 nonfatal
strokes in 170,000 person-years of follow-up),
availability of data for both men and for women,
a measure of MDD defined according to core
DSM-IV diagnostic criteria and a more general
measure of mental health well-being, together
with baseline assessments that allowed adjustment for a wide range of cerebrovascular risk factors.
However, the study has a number of important
limitations. First, the restricted age range and
characteristics of the cohort may reduce the generalizability of findings. Participation in the study
involved commitment to future collection of detailed biologic and dietary data. While this resulted in a cohort that included fewer current
cigarette smokers than the general resident population of England, the sample was representative
in terms of anthropometric variables, blood pressure and serum lipids,[13] and in terms of physical
and mental functional health.[25] Secondly, given
that health care systems vary in their use of inpatient services for the assessment and treatment of
patients with stroke, and perhaps because these
might vary most for less severe stroke,[26] less severe stroke endpoints may have been underascertained through use only of data from death
certificates and from hospital admissions.
Limitations of measurement and of power
should be taken into account when interpreting
the finding of no association between episodic
mood state and incident stroke in these data. The
HLEQ structured self-assessment of MDD represents a pragmatic solution to enabling such measures to be included in a large scale chronic

disease epidemiology setting. Previous work
(based upon a subsample of these data) has
shown DSM-IV MDD prevalence estimates and
associated demographic risk profiles to be
broadly similar to those derived from dedicated
large-scale psychiatric epidemiology research
studies.[16] This study had 80% power (at the 5%
level of significance) to detect a relative risk of
magnitude 1.33 for lifetime and 1.53 for 12-month
MDD. While this sample was large, with nearly
600 stroke endpoints observed in over 8 years of
(median) follow-up, the relatively low prevalence
of the exposure variables limits the capacity of the
current study to have detected associations of
more modest magnitude. In addition, the poten

tial for differential recall bias arising from the requirement of a 4-week retrospective recall period
for the MHI-5 vs 1-year and lifetime periods of
recall for the MDD and GAD diagnostic modules
may provide an alternative explanation to the
negative findings observed in relation to these
measures here.
This community-based cohort study has been
able to report associations between mental health
status measures defined by a measure of psychological distress (previously identified as an effective screening instrument for mood disorders[21]),
and by diagnostic criteria and incident (fatal and
nonfatal) stroke. Our results are consistent with
previous evidence, based upon a range of self

report depression symptom scales, that greater
emotional symptomatic distress is associated with
increased stroke risk.[4,8,9,11,12] A previous attempt
to evaluate the association between a lifetime history of depressive disorder, defined through use
of restricted diagnostic criteria, and stroke (involving a 13-year follow-up of 1,703 study participants) reported evidence of a two- to threefold
increased risk of stroke but was limited by endpoint rarity (66 self-reported strokes and 29
stroke-related deaths during the follow-up), and
by incomplete adjustment for cerebrovascular
risk factors.[7] A further registry study also reported evidence of association between patients
admitted to hospital for depression and subsequent stroke but was unable to adjust for relevant
risk factors.[10] While previous evidence has shown
anxiety, including GAD, to be common in patients for up to 3 years following stroke,[27,28] the
authors are unaware of any previous examination
of the association between GAD and stroke incidence. Given that depression is commonly comor

question concerned with current anxiety, our results suggesting no association between GAD and
incident stroke, though limited by power considerations, are of interest in aiding collective interpretation of these findings.
Stroke is among the leading causes of longterm disability and death worldwide.[30] While evidence, based upon the Framingham Study
original and offspring cohorts, has reported decreases in the incidence of stroke and atherothrombotic brain infarction over the past 50
years, achieved in part through improved risk factor control, continued efforts are needed to identify new risk factors that may aid primary
prevention and reduce post-stroke disability and
mortality.[31] Our results respond to calls for work
to aid insight into understanding the origin of the
relationship between mood status and stroke
risk.[6] They focus attention on the conceptually
more general nature of psychological distress and
well-being, represented by the MHI-5, rather than
the specific represented by MDD and GAD.
However, limitations of statistical power in relation to both the measures of MDD and GAD diagnostic status warrant caution in discounting
their respective association with incident stroke.
In addition, difficulty in being able to demonstrate discontinuities or points of rarity between
related psychiatric syndromes[32] has remained a
challenge in the specification of diagnostic criteria.[33,34] It is possible that psychological distress,
within a broader spectrum of mental health variation, is part of a prolonged prodrome to stroke or
that the association may be due to residual confounding. Further work is needed to replicate
these findings, to consider emotional health associations according to stroke subtypes, and to evaluate potential mechanisms such as for example
the debated association between homocysteine
concentration and depression and stroke.[35-37]
