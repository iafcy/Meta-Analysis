OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mediator role of inflammation in any relationship between depressive symptoms
and ischemic stroke.
DESIGN: Longitudinal prospective study.
SETTING: Review of medical records, death certificates,
and the Medicare healthcare utilization database for hospitalizations.
PARTICIPANTS: Total of 5,525 elderly men and women
aged 65 and older who were prospectively followed from
1989 to 2000 as participants in the Cardiovascular Health
Study.
MEASUREMENTS: Depression symptom scores, inflammatory markers.
RESULTS: Greater depressive symptoms were associated
with risk of ischemic stroke (unadjusted hazard ratio
(HR) 5 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5 1.09–1.59;
HR 5 1.26, 95% CI 5 1.03–1.54, adjusted for traditional
risk factors). When a term for inflammation (C-reactive
protein (CRP)) was introduced in the model, the HRs were
not appreciably altered (unadjusted HR 5 1.31, 95%
CI 5 1.08–1.58; adjusted HR 5 1.25, 95% CI 5 1.02–
1.53), indicating that CRP at baseline was not a mediator
in this relationship. In analyses stratified according to CRP
levels, a J-shaped relationship between depressive symptoms and stroke was evident in the unadjusted analyses; in
the fully adjusted model, only CRP in the highest tertile was
associated with a higher risk for stroke in the presence of
higher depressive symptoms scores.
CONCLUSION: The analyses from this prospective study
provide evidence of a positive association between depressive symptoms and risk of incident stroke. Inflammation, as

of these have been longitudinal studies that have controlled
for most of the commonly accepted stroke etiological factors. Although the relationship between depression and
cerebrovascular disease events has been consistent, current
understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains speculative. It has been hypothesized that inflammation could
be one of the mechanisms by which depression increases
risk for ischemic stroke. Inflammatory factors have been
linked to stroke.[9–11] For example, one study found a relative risk of 1.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5 1.01–1.54)
in men and 1.3 (95% CI 5 1.07–1.55) in women for stroke
in subjects with high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) after
adjusting for common stroke risk factors. [9] Another study
found that CRP was an independent risk factor for stroke
and that carotid intima-media thickness did not appear to
act as the mediator.[11] Recently, inflammation has also been
linked to depression. A third study showed that elevated
CRP, fibrinogen, and factor VIIc were associated with depression in older adults, although it found that exhaustion
and fatigue had a stronger association with CRP than
depression.[12] In young adult men included in the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey sample, CRP was associated with current depression even after
adjustment for body mass index (BMI), smoking, and
health status. Men whose depression had resolved had almost the same prevalence of high CRP as those who had
never experienced a major depressive episode.[13]

A systematic review and meta-analysis reported that
CRP was associated with risk of stroke and cognitive
impairment, but the relationship between CRP and depression was not consistent. Most of these studies have been
cross-sectional, and the causal pathway between CRP and


-----

depression may be bidirectional. One conclusion was that
future prospective studies designed to elucidate these associations are warranted.[14]

Current understanding of the underlying mechanisms
by which depression increases the risk of stroke remains
uncertain. This study examined prospectively the relationship between depressive symptoms and ischemic stroke using data from a large community-based cohort of older
adults. The extent to which inflammation acts as a mediator
for the relationship between depressive symptoms and
stroke was assessed. Because depressive symptoms and inflammation may act synergistically to increase risk of
stroke, whether the relationship between depressive symptoms and stroke differs according to level of inflammation
was also examined. If inflammation was the primary pathway by which depression leads to stroke, preventive interventions could be targeted to normalizing inflammation.

METHODS

Description of Population
The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a longitudinal,
observational study of men and women aged 65 and older
designed to investigate risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[15] The main outcome measures in the CHS were coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral vascular disease, and
stroke. In the CHS, a total of 5,888 participants from a
sample of Medicare-eligible individuals residing in one of
four communities (Sacramento County, California; Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina;
and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) were enrolled in two phases.
In the initial recruiting phase, 5,201 participants were enrolled between 1989 and 1991. A second enrollment of 687
African-American participants was completed between
1992 and 1993. The exclusion criteria for the CHS
included hospice treatment, being wheelchair bound in the
home, and undergoing radiation or chemotherapy for cancer.
Additionally, for this analysis, all participants in whom
record review confirmed self-reported history of stroke were
included. The institutional review boards at each participating institution approved the research protocols.

Data Collection
Depressive Symptoms
Information on depressive symptoms was based on questionnaire-derived data collected by trained interviewers in
the CHS at baseline (1989–1991). Depressive symptoms
were evaluated using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).[16] A modified version of the
CES-D with only 10-items was used in the CHS study.[17] The
CES-D assesses frequency of depressive symptoms experienced in the previous week. The items are scored on a 4point (0 5 rarely to 3 5 always) scale, and individual item
scores are totaled to yield a summary score. Higher scores
indicate more depressive symptoms. The traditional score
(48) on the 10-item CES-D, which has been considered to
indicate ‘‘high likelihood of clinical depression,’’ was used.
This scale is reliable, and other investigators have validated
it.[18] Its psychometric properties include a sensitivity of 90%


Inflammatory Markers
Blood was drawn in the morning after an overnight fast.
Samples were promptly centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 minutes at � 701C. CRP was measured in 1997 on all stored
baseline plasma samples using a high-sensitivity immunoassay with an interassay coefficient of variation of 6.25%.
CRP levels at baseline were available as a continuous variable and were categorized into tertiles for the analyses.

Other Covariates
Information on sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex,
race, education, income, occupation, marital status) and
self-report of chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease) were collected at baseline.
Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were
also recorded at baseline. BMI was calculated as weight (kg)
per height (m) squared. Trained personnel measured blood
pressure. The mean of two readings was used for this analysis. Hypertension was defined as a previous diagnosis of
hypertension, taking antihypertensive medication, or having a current systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher
or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. Persons
were considered diabetic if they had a medical diagnosis
of diabetes mellitus or a fasting glucose of 126 mg/dL or
higher. Information about smoking history was ascertained
at baseline. Total cholesterol levels, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and triglycerides were
measured in blood samples at baseline, using well-established quality-assurance methods.[20] Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was estimated using Friedewald’s
formula.[21]

Diagnosis of Stroke
Methods for the classification of stroke status and subtype
in the CHS have been reported elsewhere in detail.[22,23]

Briefly, comprehensive protocols were conducted to identify
cerebrovascular events or death during the course of the
study. Participants were contacted every 6 months to establish vital status and to screen for the occurrence of
events. Confirmation of events and deaths were conducted
through review of medical records, death certificates and
the Medicare healthcare utilization database for hospitalizations. Participants and contacts of participants unavailable for follow-up were interviewed about the event or
death. When stroke was suspected, the study neurologist at
the study site reviewed all sources of information (medical
records and death certificates). Raters did not have access to
participants’ CES-D scores. The cerebrovascular adjudication committee, comprising study neurologists from each of
four study sites, a neuroradiologist from the magnetic resonance imaging reading center, and an internist or neurologist representing the Coordinating Center reviewed all
cerebrovascular events and all deaths. A neurologist in each
center abstracted and reviewed hospital records for all reported strokes with International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, codes 430 through 438 identifying cerebrovascular disease. Neuroimaging studies were completed for
86% of the participants. The committee considered all
clinical and radiological information to decide whether a
nonfatal stroke or fatal stroke had occurred and, if appropriate, assigned a stroke type: ischemic, hemorrhagic, or


-----

to a stroke when a majority opinion was that, more likely
than not, the death would not have occurred in the absence
of stroke. Stroke was defined as a neurological deficit of
rapid onset lasting more than 24 hours or, if less than 24
hours, an appropriate lesion to explain the deficit seen on
brain imaging. Time of stroke was established according to
the first diagnosis, if recorded in medical records, or on the
death certificate.

Statistical Analysis
The chi-square (w[2]) test was used to assess associations between categorical variables. Differences in means of risk
factors levels between the depressed group and the nondepressed group were tested using a t-test. Because of skewed
distribution, CRP was log transformed for analyses when
indicated. Incidence rates of stroke were calculated according to depressive symptoms category. Cox proportional
hazards models were used to compute HRs as estimates of
relative risk of stroke for high depressive scores, with adjustment for sociodemographic (age, sex, race, occupation,
income, education level, marital status) and classic stroke
risk factors (hypertension status, diabetes mellitus status,
smoking, CHD status, cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, and BMI) (Figure 1).
The interaction between depressive symptoms and CRP
as continuous variables and as categorical variables was
tested. To determine the extent to which inflammation mediates the relationship between depressive symptoms and
stroke, Cox regression was used to compare the analyses
with and without CRP in the unadjusted and adjusted
models. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata
version 7.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). All tests
were two sided, and statistical significance was considered
at an alpha level of 0.05.


RESULTS
Of the 5,888 participants in the study, 249 were excluded
because of the presence of baseline stroke. Thus, 5,639 were
considered for this analysis. Because there was no relationship between depressive symptoms and hemorrhagic
strokes (n 5 114), hemorrhagic strokes were also excluded
from the remaining analyses, leaving 5,525 participants.

Figure 1. Time to first ischemic stroke according to depressive


The Kaplan–Meier curve shows that subjects with high depressive scores ( �8 points) had greater risk of stroke than
subjects with low depressive scores (o8 points), with no
stabilization of risk. The difference in the risk of stroke
between the two categories of depressive symptoms
was highly statistically significant (log rank value 5 8.33,
P 5.004).
The baseline characteristics of the study cohort according to stroke status are presented in Table 1. Participants with incident ischemic stroke were more likely to be
older and nonprofessional; have an income less than
$25,000; have a lower educational level; and be widowed,
divorced, or separated. No differences were found according to sex or race. Participants with stroke were more likely
to have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, impaired fasting glucose, and coronary heart disease and
higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol,
triglycerides, and depressive scores than their counterparts
without stroke. No differences were found according to
BMI, HDL-C, or LDL-C. Mean and median baseline CRP
was significantly higher in the stroke group than in the
control group (Po.01). Participants with higher depressive
scores were more likely to be older, female, African American, and nonprofessional; have an income less than
$25,000; have a lower educational level; and be widowed,
divorced, or separated. Compared to those with lower
depressive scores participants with higher depressive symptoms scores were also more likely to have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease; to
be a current smoker; and to have higher BMI, HDL-C, and
CRP levels than those with lower depressive symptoms
scores.
During a median follow-up of 11 years, 607 incident
ischemic strokes occurred: an incidence rate of 12.1 strokes
per 1,000 person-years. Incidence rates were 14.9 and 11.4
strokes per 1,000 person-years for individuals with and
without depression, respectively (Po.01). When subjects
without depression were stratified according to CRP levels,
stroke incidence rates were lowest in the lowest CRP tertile
(9.6 per 1,000 person-years) and highest in the highest CRP
tertile (13.2 per 1,000 person-years). For participants with
higher depressive scores, a higher incidence rate was
detected in the third tertile of CRP, with a range from
12.3 to 18.3 per 1,000 person-years.

Multivariate Survival Analysis
The unadjusted HR of ischemic stroke was 1.32 (95%
CI 5 1.09–1.59) for higher depressive symptoms. After
adding the CRP term (as a continuous variable), the HR
was not attenuated and was equal to 1.31 (95% CI 5 1.08–
1.58). After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, race, occupation, income, education, and
marital status) and traditional stroke risk factors (cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, BMI, high blood pressure, diabetes status, and CHD status), depressed
individuals had a 26% greater HR of ischemic stroke. Adding the CRP term as a continuous variable instead of a
categorical variable to the fully adjusted model, the association between depressive mood and stroke remained
of similar magnitude, and CRP contributed significantly

Stratified Analyses
Whether depressive symptoms and inflammation might act
synergistically to increase risk of stroke was analyzed (Table
2). Both variables (depressive symptoms and CRP) were
first modeled as continuous variables at baseline. In these
analyses, the interaction term did not meet criteria for statistical significance (P 5.85), although the main effect terms
for depressive symptoms and CRP remained statistically
significant. When the data were analyzed according to tertiles of CRP, there appeared to be a J-shaped relationship,


levels. Adjustment for multiple factors did not appreciably
change the relationships.

DISCUSSION
These analyses demonstrated a positive relationship
between baseline higher depressive symptoms and risk of
ischemic stroke. Older adults with a depressive symptom
score in the range of clinical depression at baseline had, on
average, a 32% greater HR for ischemic stroke. This HR

characteristics and other traditional stroke risk factors,
including smoking and existing clinical cardiovascular
disease. There was essentially no association between depressive symptoms and hemorrhagic stroke. These results
confirm those reported in other prospective studies.[1–3,5,7,8]

Even though there was a positive association between
level of CRP and baseline depressive symptoms, it was not
found that CRP acted as an important mediator in the relationship between depressive symptoms and stroke. It is
possible that the relationship between depressive symptoms
and stroke was too weak to allow an adequate test of inflammation as a mediator. Another aspect of the analysis
that should be kept in mind is that CRP was measured
at baseline. Although little is known about the temporal
relationship between depressive symptoms and CRP, it is
possible that the results would have been different if CRP
had been measured months or years after the depressive
symptoms were measured. This would be a more-definitive
test of inflammation as a mediator between depressive
symptoms and stroke. Because it has been suggested that the
association between CRP and stroke might be stronger in
men than in women,[11] a stratified analysis was conducted
based on sex. The results for men and women were similar,
with no suggestion that inflammation was an important
mediator for the relationship between depressive symptoms
and stroke. CRP was an inflammatory indicator in our
analyses. Interleukin-6 and other inflammatory markers
could be mediators in the relationship between depression
and stroke.[24] The data from the current study suggest that
there may be pathways other than inflammation by which
depressive symptoms act as a risk for stroke. Possibilities
include platelet dysfunction, abnormalities in blood coagulation, endothelial dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction,
and abnormalities in heart rate variability.[25–28]

A pattern was identified in unadjusted and fully ad

highest tertile of CRP had a greater risk of stroke than those
in the other two tertiles. Although this relationship needs to
be confirmed before changing any clinical practice guidelines, it is possible that the combination of depressive
symptoms and elevated CRP may be useful for targeting
interventions to a high-risk group.

LIMITATIONS
These analyses have some limitations. First, no diagnostic
confirmation of depression was completed. Depressive
symptoms as the exposure variable was considered to be a
proxy for a clinical diagnosis of major depression. The CES-D
has been found to be a good screening instrument for
major depression with good to excellent sensitivity and
specificity.[18] The results might have been different if there
had been a measure of clinical depression. For example, a
previous study reported findings indicating a dose–response
relationship between diagnostically defined depression and
stroke.[7] Second, there is the possibility of residual confounding, although the maximum information available for
the reported statistical models was used, and it was possible
to include information on a number of potential confounding factors. In addition, depressive symptoms were assessed
as a continuous and a categorical variable. The consistency
of findings was preserved. Third, the possibility cannot be
excluded that higher depressive symptoms scores are not a
consequence of subclinical strokes. The clinical evidence of
stroke at baseline was used as an exclusion criterion.
Subclinical cases could have been identified using MRI. Although the CHS investigators conducted an MRI evaluation, it was done in the third year of the study and not at
baseline. Consequently, it was decided not to use this information. Fourth, the CHS participants might differ with
respect to some characteristics from the general older adult
population, although the rate of higher depressive symptom
scores in this study was comparable with what has been
found in other studies of older adults in the general population. There is no evidence to support a selection differential according to depression status, and the internal
validity necessary for comparisons should be preserved.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the current report
improves understanding of the relationships between depressive symptoms and inflammation with the subsequent
development of ischemic stroke. Future analyses will need
to explore in more detail the temporal relationships between depressive symptoms and inflammatory markers and
to examine other mechanisms that may mediate the effect of
depression on cerebrovascular disease. Depression has been
found to be a risk factor for a wide range of cardiovascular
diseases and has been associated with some measures of
subclinical atherosclerosis,[29] suggesting that platelet aggregation is not the sole mechanism. Multiple pathways leading to atherosclerosis will need to be considered.
