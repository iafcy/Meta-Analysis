**Background: Several lines of evidence indicate that de-**
pression is importantly associated with cardiovascular disease end points. However, little is known about the role
of depression in stroke mortality.

**Methods: This study examined the association between**
depressive symptoms and stroke mortality in a prospective study of behavioral, social, and psychological factors
related to health and mortality in a community sample of
6676 initially stroke-free adults (45.8% male; 79.1% white;
mean age at baseline, 43.4 years) from Alameda County,

symptoms at baseline was associated with increased risk
of stroke mortality, after adjusting for age, sex, and race
(hazard ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.39;

ditional adjustments for education, alcohol consumption, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, and diabetes (hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.062.22; P�.02). Time-dependent covariate models, which
allowed changes in reported depressive symptoms and
risk factor levels during follow-up, revealed the same pattern of associations.

**Conclusions: This population-based study provides the**
strongest epidemiological evidence to date for a significant relationship between depressive symptoms andstroke
mortality. These results contribute to the growing literature on the adverse health effects of depression.

### METHODS

**THE ALAMEDA COUNTY STUDY**

The Alameda County Study is an ongoing longitudinal
study of the role of various behavioral, psychological,
social, and demographic factors in health and mortality
among a community sample of men and women. The
study began in 1965 and used a stratified random household sampling procedure to recruit a representative
sample of the adult, noninstitutionalized population of
Alameda County, California. A total of 6928 adults (86%
of those eligible), ages 16 to 94 years, provided baseline
information by written questionnaires on health history
and status, health habits, psychological feelings and attitudes, marital history and status, childbearing practices,
civic, social, and recreational activities, occupational history and status, life history during childhood and adolescence, and standard demographic variables. Subjects were
tracked regardless of location or disability status and survivors were asked to complete questionnaires again in
1974, 1983 (50% sample), 1994, and 1995, with response
rates between 85% and 97%. For the present study, only
data from the 1965, 1974, and 1983 surveys were used.
Questionnaires were similar in style and response format, and every effort was made to keep the wording of
items and the length of the questionnaires consistent
across all waves of data collection. Participants were
requested to complete the questionnaires on their own,
ie, “proxy” respondents were not used. After initial
recruitment and determination of eligibility, questionnaires were sent to and returned from participants by
mail. Detailed design and sampling procedures for this
study have been reported previously.[28,29] The research
protocol was approved by the California Health and
Welfare Agency Committee for the Protection of Human
Subjects and conducted in accordance with their guidelines regarding informed consent for participation in
research in which the sole form of data collection is via
mailed surveys.

with stroke incidence. In addition, the majority of participants in that study had only a grade school education and many had very limited incomes, making the generalizability of the findings somewhat limited.
Simonsick and colleagues[26] used data from the 3
study sites from the Established Populations for Epidemiological Studies of the Elderly to assess the relationship between symptoms of depression and hypertensionrelated morbidity and mortality among a sample of older
adults diagnosed as having hypertension. In general, they
found that hypertensive men and women who reported
high levels of depressive symptoms were more than twice
as likely to experience a stroke during the subsequent 3
to 6 years than their hypertensive, nondepressed counterparts. However, results were not consistent across study
sites, and because of the design of that study, there was
no way of determining whether the depressive symptoms were a cause or a consequence of the complications of hypertension.


**STUDY POPULATION**

All participants who were interviewed in 1965, had complete data on the measure of depression and all covariates,
and did not have a history of stroke were included in the
present study. Of the 6867 persons eligible, 46 were excluded because of incomplete or missing data on the depression scale and 145 were excluded because of missing
data on covariates, leaving a total of 6676 subjects for the
present analyses. Nonparticipants were older, had fewer
years of education, were more likely to have a history of
diabetes or hypertension but were less likely to be current
smokers and more likely to be nondrinkers than participants (P�.01).

**HUMAN POPULATION LABORATORY**
**DEPRESSION SCALE**

Depressive symptoms were measured by the Human
Population Laboratory (HPL) Depression Scale, an 18item scale developed by Roberts and colleagues[30-32] that
assesses mood disturbances, negative self-concept, loss of
energy, problems with eating and sleeping, and psychomotor retardation or agitation. Scores are calculated by
assigning 1 point for each “true” or “false” answer that
corresponds to a depressed response. Item-total correlations for the depression scale range from 0.18 to 0.45 with
Cronbach � of 0.77, indicating good internal consistency.
A symptom score of 5 or higher is considered indicative
of depression or mood disturbance, albeit not necessarily
clinical depression. The symptoms do not fully operationalize Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
_Revised Third Edition (DSM-III-R)[33]_ criteria for a major
depressive episode. However, the cutoff of 5 or more
symptoms to define caseness has been used in numerous
analyses to indicate significant symptomatology, has demonstrated reliability and validity,[30-32] is conceptually similar to other brief symptom checklists such as the CES-D
scale, and an earlier study found that it correlated well
with the Beck Depression Inventory (r=0.66) in an outpatient clinical population.[31]

Also, it was recently reported that an increase in
CES-D scores over a period of 4[1]⁄2 years was associated
with excess risk of mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction in more than 4300 participants from the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program.[27] These findings were upheld after adjustments for age, race, sex,
disease history, and smoking status, and the increase in
depressive symptoms was a stronger risk factor for women
than for men. Baseline levels of depressive symptoms were
not related to cardiovascular events, however, and the
authors noted that causal pathways could not be inferred from their data, in part because all participants had
isolated systolic hypertension and it is plausible that premonitory symptoms of CVD contributed to increased
depressive symptoms prior to a clinical event.
The present study examined the association between self-reported depressive symptoms and stroke mortality over a 29-year period in a community sample of
6676 men and women. The analyses reported are from

**STROKE MORTALITY**

Mortality tapes from California were searched annually for
information on study participants. Out-of-state deaths were
ascertained during follow-up contact, in which death certificates were requested from the state of residence. Death
certificates were used to verify cause of death. Stroke mortality was based on International Classification of Diseases,
_Ninth Revision (ICD-9)[34]_ codes 400 to 436.

**COVARIATES**

Risk factors, assessed at each wave of data collection, included education, assessed as years of school completed;
alcohol consumption, assessed as number of drinks per
month and summed for individual report of beer, wine, and
liquor consumption; body mass index, calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared; smoking; and self-report of hypertension and diabetes.
Covariates were modeled as follows: education was
coded as less than vs equal to or greater than 12 years of
education; alcohol consumption was categorized as heavy
(�45 drinks per month) or none, with moderate consumption (1-45 drinks per month) as the reference category; body
mass index was modeled continuously; smoking was coded
as pack-years of smoking; hypertension and diabetes history were dichotomized in response to the question, “Have
you ever seen a medical doctor for (condition)?”

**DATA ANALYSES**

The relationship between self-reported depressive symptoms and mortality due to stroke was examined using Cox
proportional hazards models,[35] with and without timedependent covariates. All assumptions for the Cox models were tested and met. Deaths were included through 1994.
Subjects known to have died of stroke and not lost to follow-up were kept in the analysis until the year of their death.
Subjects not known to have died and who were available
for follow-up were given a survival time of 29 years. Subjects unavailable for follow-up in either the 1974 or 1983

symptoms and other risk factors were obtained on multiple occasions between 1965 and 1994. Using information from repeated assessments of these variables enabled us to more rigorously examine the relationship
between depression and stroke mortality, which could
be expected to vary with changes in risk factors over time.


surveys were censored on the survey date when unavailability for follow-up occurred. Subjects who died of causes
other than stroke were censored in the year of their death.
Statistical analyseswereperformedusing commercially available software (PROC PHREG in SAS, version 6.09[36]) installed on a Sun SPARCstation 20 (Sun Microsystems Computer Corporation, Mountain View, Calif).
Two types of models were calculated. In the first type,
the initial model examined the crude relationship between depressive symptoms reported at baseline and subsequent stroke mortality. Initial analyses modeled depression continuously. However, because our prior use of the
HPL Depression Scale indicated that a cutoff of 5 symptoms was indicative of significant symptomatology, [30-32]
subsequent analyses contrasted subjects with 5 or more
depressive symptoms and those with fewer than 5 symptoms. Covariate adjustments for age, sex, and race (white or
nonwhite) were then added. A third Cox model was then
calculated that also included covariates representing the
1965 values of education, alcohol consumption, smoking,
body mass index, and history of hypertension and diabetes.
The second type of model used consisted of timedependentcovariatemodels,whichwerecalculatedtodetermine if changes in depressive symptoms and changes in risk
factorlevelsduringfollow-upinfluencedtheassociationbetween depression and stroke mortality. In these analyses, all
variablesexceptage,sex,andracewereallowedtochangebased
on data from the additional survey periods. For example, a
participant who reported that he or she drank 20 drinks per
monthin1965butwhosealcoholconsumptionhadincreased
to more than 50 drinks per month in 1974 would be scored
as a “moderate drinker” from 1965 to 1973, and as a “heavy

moderate alcohol consumption (�45 drinks in a month),
and 22% were abstainers. At baseline, 39.7% of subjects
were never smokers, 15.7% were former smokers, and
44.6% were current smokers. A total of 677 (10.1%) participants reported a history of hypertension, and 143
(2.1%) reported a history of diabetes. Mean body mass
index was 23.8 kg/m[2].

**DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, RISK FACTORS,**
**AND STROKE MORTALITY**

A total of 969 subjects (14.5%) reported 5 or more depressive symptoms at baseline. As shown in Table 1,
these subjects were older, less likely to be male or white,
less likely to have at least 12 years of education, more
likely to be abstainers and current smokers, and more
likely to have prevalent hypertension and prevalent diabetes than those who were not depressed at baseline

**SUBJECT CHARACTERISTICS**

At baseline, participants ranged in age from 17 to 94 years
(mean, 43.4; SD, 15.9), 45.8% were male, and 79.1% were
white. Most (65%) participants had completed 12 or more
years of school, although nearly 18% reported less than
9 years of formal education. Approximately 14.5% of participants reported consuming more than 45 alcoholic
drinks per month (coded by the quantity and frequency

smokers at the time of the baseline survey, the depressed group had more pack-years of smoking than the
nondepressed group (P�.03). Depressed and nondepressed groups did not differ in body mass index or prevalence of heavy drinking.
One hundred sixty-nine stroke deaths occurred during follow-up, 39 of which occurred among participants
reporting 5 or more symptoms of depression (4.0%) and
130 of which occurred among the nondepressed group
(2.3%). The Figure illustrates the Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival curves for the depressed and nondepressed groups. The unadjusted Cox model hazard ratio associated with having 5 or more depressive symptoms
was 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-2.78;

the analysis with depressive symptoms modeled continuously and the findings from the models with depression modeled categorically, with added covariates. Each
1-point increase on the HPL Depression Scale was associated with more than an 8% increase in risk of death from
stroke (P�.003). With depressive symptoms modeled categorically, the risk associated with reporting 5 or more
depressive symptoms was 1.66 (P�.006), after adjustments for age, sex, and race. In the model that included
additional adjustments for baseline values of education,
alcohol consumption, smoking, hypertension, diabetes,
and body mass index, having 5 or more depressive symptoms was associated with a 54% increased risk of stroke
mortality (P�.02).

pattern of associations. The initial model, with scores on
the measure of depression modeled continuously and allowed to vary with each wave of data collection and age,
sex, and race held constant, revealed a 6% increase in risk
of stroke mortality with each 1-point increase in depression (P�.10). In the categorical model, with age, sex, and
race held constant and number of times 5 or more depressive symptoms were reported in the successive waves
of data collection allowed to change, self-report of 5 or
more depressive symptoms was associated with a 56%
increased risk of stroke mortality (P�.06). The elevation in risk associated with a high level of depressive symptoms was essentially unchanged in the fully adjusted
model in which covariates for all risk factors were allowed to vary according to participants’ reported values

these models were similar to those with the baseline covariates, although the statistical significance was diminished slightly because of the fewer number of fatal strokes
included in the analyses.

**EFFECT OF PREVALENT CVD**

Because rates of depressive syndromes are known to be
elevated among individuals with CVD,[11,13-15] we recalculated the Cox model examining the relationship between baseline level of depressive symptoms and subsequent stroke mortality, excluding 259 participants
(including 11 cases of fatal stroke) who reported a history of heart disease in 1965. Results were unchanged
from the original model. Each 1-point increase in depression was associated with an 8% increase in risk of
stroke mortality (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.15;
_P�.006); and persons reporting 5 or more depressive_
symptoms at baseline had 70% excess risk of stroke mortality, after adjustment for age, sex, and race (hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.15-2.50; P�.007). Additional adjustments for education, alcohol consumption, body mass
index, smoking status, diabetes, and hypertension had
little effect on this relationship (hazard ratio, 1.57; 95%
CI, 1.06-2.32; P�.03).

**EFFECT OF EARLY DEATHS**

Because symptoms of depression may be a response to
illness and we wanted to exclude individuals who may
have been sick at the beginning of the study, baseline covariate analyses were then repeated eliminating the participants who died during the first 3 years of the study
of stroke (n=14) or any other cause (n=231). Again, each
1-point increase on the measure of depression was associated with nearly an 8% increase in risk of stroke mortality in the initial model (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.021.14; P�.01). Similarly, the categorical models showed
that individuals with 5 or more depressive symptoms at
baseline were at 1.67-fold increased risk of subsequent
mortality due to stroke (95% CI, 1.14-2.45; P�.008),
which remained significantly elevated after adjustment
for all risk factors (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95%CI, 1.042.26; P�.03).


**COMMENT**


This population-based study provides, to our knowledge, the best epidemiological evidence to date for a significant, positive relationship between depressive symptoms and stroke mortality. After adjustment for established
stroke risk factors, individuals reporting 5 or more symptoms of depression at baseline experienced more than 50%
excess risk of mortality due to stroke during the subsequent 29 years. This level of risk was unchanged after
taking into account changes in reported depressive symptoms and risk factor levels during follow-up. Moreover,
these relationships were upheld in models that excluded early deaths and individuals with prevalent CVD
at baseline. The consistency of the association between
depressive symptoms and stroke mortality is high

served in our various statistical models.
The mechanisms by which depression may increase stroke risk remain to be determined. Our data show
that behavioral factors do not explain the association between depression and stroke mortality. For example, although participants with 5 or more symptoms of depression were more likely to smoke and to have more packyears of smoking than those who were not depressed
(Table 1), smoking did not significantly affect the observed association. Similarly, preexisting hypertension or
diabetes accounted only for a small portion of the relationship. Our measures of hypertension and diabetes were
by self-report only, which may not be as sensitive as other
measures of disease, eg, medication review or physician
report; however, these risk factors were significant or marginally significant (P�.20) covariates in our models. Thus,
although our self-report measures were not ideal, they
were reliable indicators of these risk factors and important covariates in our models.
Other risk factors, unavailable to us, also should
be considered. For example, associations between depression or other affective states and lipid levels or metabolism, while somewhat conflicting, have been reported[13,37-39] and it will be important for future research
to examine these potential pathways. New evidence indicates that platelet calcium (Ca++) responsivity to serotonin is heightened in depressed patients,[40] suggesting that platelet activation could also be an important
factor in the relationship between depression and stroke
mortality. In addition, depression may increase stroke
mortality through immunological or neuroendocrine
mechanisms. The present study did not have the data to
examine these hypotheses, although other studies are suggestive.[18,19,41,42]
Nearly 15% of participants in this study reported 5
or more symptoms of depression at baseline. Our measure of depression estimates the point prevalence of depressive symptoms but our rates do not reflect the prevalence of clinical depression. This measure includes many
(but not all) symptom criteria for major depression from
the DSM-III-R. Because our data are self-report, we were
not able to use DSM-III-R exclusionary criteria; therefore, our prevalence rates are higher than would be the
case if clinical diagnoses had been made on the basis of
structured psychiatric interviews. However, available data
(not shown) from our 1994 survey, which included a measure with full coverage of DSM-III-R symptom criteria as
well as the HPL Depression Scale, indicate that 65% of
those with 5 or more symptoms on the HPL Depression
Scale also met the criteria for major depressive episode
according to DSM-III-R criteria. Also, as noted elsewhere,[32,43,44] the 2 different measurement strategies assess somewhat different domains of depressive experience. Clinical depression can be a serious, debilitating
chronic disease; however, the presence of many symptoms of depression can also involve considerable impairment and negative sequelae. Thus, our symptom-based
measure may underestimate the effect of depression on
risk of stroke.
Some limitations to our study should be noted. We
did not have access to data on nonfatal strokes and thus

sion and incident stroke among our participants. Such
data would provide valuable information and greater understanding of the role of depression in stroke risk. We
also did not have data on the types of stroke participants suffered. It would be interesting to determine if depression had more or less impact on hemorrhagic vs ischemic stroke. Such information may provide clues to
the mechanisms underlying the association. Also, we had
too few stroke deaths among women to reliably investigate sex differences in the association between depression and stroke mortality. Given that women have higher
rates of depression,[45] and that stroke accounts for a greater
proportion of overall deaths among women than among
men,[46] it is critical that this issue be addressed.
In sum, the present study provides compelling evidence that depressive symptoms are a significant factor
in subsequent stroke mortality in a representative adult
sample. These results contribute to the growing literature on the adverse health effects of depression. Given
the high lifetime prevalence rates of depression in the
United States for men (2.8/100) and women (7.4/100),[47]
and the convincing evidence that depression has a strong
negative impact on physical health, in addition to its devastating mental health consequences, it is imperative that
symptoms of depression be recognized and appropriately
treated.
