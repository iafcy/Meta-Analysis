     teractions with sex were observed.
     A high score on the L er index
    was related to an increased risk of both
     functional gastrointestinal and hyperim-

     index interacted with age in predicting in-

     sons with a low mental health score were at
    reduced hazard (RH = 0.76; CI = 0.62,
     0.92). No other main effects or interactions
    were noted.
     A high score on the worries index
    was associated with an increased risk for
     functional gastrointestinal disease. The
     worries index was also strongly related to
     mortality and to incidence of ischemic
