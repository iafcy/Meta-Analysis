with increased cortisol levels,[5] increased platelet
reactivity[6] and reduced heart rate variability.[7] In
addition, depressive disorder is associated with
unhealthy lifestyle choices, including choices
regarding smoking[8] and medication adherence.[9]

However, it seems that the prevalence of classic
vascular risk factors is similar among those with
and without depressive disorder[10] and does not
predict incident depression.[11]

It has been reported that patients with depressive symptoms are at increased risk of vascular
disease.[10] Salaycik et al recently found that the
presence of depressive symptoms was a risk factor
for stroke in persons younger than 65 years of age,
but not in the elderly.[12] This contradicts earlier
studies that reported an increased risk of stroke in
elderly persons with depressive symptoms.[13 14]

More controversies remain regarding the association between depressive disorder and stroke.
Firstly, most previous studies assessed the presence
of depressive symptoms with a short questionnaire[3 13–18] whereas the positive predictive value
(the proportion of persons with depressive disorder
among all those who score positive) has been
reported to be low in selected populations[19] but in
particular in the general elderly population
(13.2%).[20] By using these short questionnaires,
there is a risk of ignoring the nature of depressive
symptoms, which are often not part of a depressive
disorder.[20] Although most researchers acknowledge
this, they still opt for the view that depressive
symptoms in general represent depressive disorders.[21] Secondly, depressive symptoms have a much
higher prevalence in women than in men,[22] and it
would be helpful to know whether gender differences in the association between depressive disorder and risk of stroke exist.
This study assessed the association between
depressive symptoms, depressive disorder and risk
of subsequent stroke in men and women in a
population based cohort study.

METHODS
Source population
The present study forms part of the Rotterdam
Study, a population based cohort study on chronic
and disabling diseases.[23] Invitations to participate
in the first study survey (1990–1993) were sent to
all inhabitants of Ommoord (a district in the city
of Rotterdam, The Netherlands) aged 55 years and
over. The participation rate of those invited was
78%; in total, 7983 subjects agreed to take part in
the study. Participants have been followed since,
and screening for depressive symptoms was added

ABSTRACT
Background: Previous studies that have assessed
whether the presence of depressive symptoms predisposes to stroke in the general elderly population have
been contradictory. Moreover, they did not distinguish
between men and women and did not perform psychiatric
workups in those with depressive symptoms. This study
examines the association between depressive symptoms,
depressive disorder and the risk of stroke in the general
population.
Methods: This prospective population based cohort study
included 4424 participants from the third Rotterdam Study
Survey (1997–1999) who, at that time, were >61 years
of age and free from stroke. Depressive symptoms were
assessed using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies
Depression Scale (CESD) and considered present if the
CESD score was >16. Participants with depressive
symptoms had a diagnostic interview for depressive
disorder. Follow-up was complete until 1 January 2005.
Data were analysed using Cox proportional hazards
models with adjustment for relevant confounders.
Results: Men with depressive symptoms (n = 73) were
at increased risk of stroke (adjusted hazard ratio (HR)
2.17; 95% CI 1.11 to 4.23) and ischaemic stroke (adjusted
HR 3.21; 95% CI 1.62 to 6.38). These associations were
at least partly attributable to men who reported
depressive symptoms but who did not fulfil Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV
diagnostic criteria for depressive disorder (n = 32): they
had a very high risk of stroke (adjusted HR 2.70; 95% CI
1.15 to 6.33) and ischaemic stroke (adjusted HR 4.01;
95% CI 1.68 to 9.57). In women there was no association
between presence of depressive symptoms and risk of
stroke.
Conclusions: Presence of depressive symptoms is a
strong risk factor for stroke in men but not in women.

It was noted in the early 1970s that elderly patients
with depressive disorder had a higher vascular
disease burden than those without depressive
disorder.[1] This observation evolved into the vascular depression hypothesis, which assumes that
depressive disorder can be caused by otherwise
subclinical cerebrovascular disease.[2] The vascular
depression hypothesis is supported by the observation that those with depressive disorder have more
white matter lesions on MRI.[3 4] However, the
directionality of the association between vascular
disease and depressive disorder may also be the
reverse, with depressive disorder not being a
consequence but a cause of vascular disease.
Depressive disorder may induce or enhance vascular disease by several mechanisms: for example

third survey (1997–1999), which constitutes the baseline survey
for the present study. At this time, participants were 61 years of
age and over. The Rotterdam Study was approved by the
Medical Ethics Committee of Erasmus University Rotterdam.
Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects
following a thorough description of the study. Follow-up for
incident stroke was complete until 1 January 2005.

Assessment of depressive symptoms and depressive disorder
Depressive disorders were assessed using a two step procedure.
Firstly, participants completed the Dutch version of the original
Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD)
during a home interview. The CESD is a 20 item self-reported
measure of symptoms, scored on a scale from 0 to 3.[24] We used a
score of 16 as a cutoff to indicate depressive symptoms. This
cutoff had a very high sensitivity for major depressive disorder
in a random sample of older subjects in The Netherlands.[20]

Previous studies have verified that a score of 16 and above on
the CESD indicates clinically significant depressive symptoms.[15]

In a second step, screen positive subjects had a psychiatric
workup. They were studied using the Dutch version of the
Present State Examination, a semistructured psychiatric interview included in the schedules for Clinical Assessment in
Neuropsychiatry.[25] All interviews were conducted by one of two
experienced clinicians, a psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist.
Psychiatric disorders were classified according to the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria
with an algorithm based on the Present State Examination
scores. The diagnostic criteria included major depression,
dysthymia and minor depressive disorder, as defined in the
DSM-IV and its appendix.

Other measurements
Blood pressure was measured twice in the right arm using a
random zero sphygmomanometer, with the participant in the
sitting position. We used the average of these two measurements. The carotid intima–media thickness was measured by
longitudinal two-dimensional ultrasound of the carotid artery.
We calculated the mean common carotid artery intima–media
thickness as the mean of four locations: the near and far walls of
both the right and left common carotid artery. Cognitive

performance was assessed using the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE).[26] We considered diabetes mellitus to be
present if a fasting glucose level was 7.0 mmol/l or higher, or if a
patient used antidiabetic medication. History of transient
ischaemic attack (TIA) was positive if an attack of presumed
vascular origin with focal symptoms that completely resolved
within 24 h in the absence of signs of non-focal (global) brain
dysfunction was reported during the interview or in general
practitioners’ files. TIAs that occurred more than 3 years before
the first study survey were not considered. A history of
myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty
(PTCA) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) was assessed
during the first survey home interview and considered positive if
confirmed by the medical records or by ECG; after enrolment
into the study, medical records were monitored continuously.
Smoking and medication use were assessed during the home
interview.

Assessment of stroke
A history of stroke at the first Rotterdam Study Survey (1990–
1993) was positive if a stroke was reported during the baseline
interview and confirmed by the medical records. After enrolment into the Rotterdam Study, participants were continuously
monitored for stroke and TIA through automated linkage of the
study database with files from general practitioners and the
municipality. Also, nursery home physicians’ files and files from
general practitioners of participants who moved out of the
district were scrutinised. For reported events, additional
information (including brain imaging) was obtained from the
hospital records. Research physicians discussed information on
all reported events with an experienced stroke neurologist (PJK)
to verify all diagnoses. Strokes were coded according to the
International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10).
Strokes were ischaemic strokes (I63), primary intracerebral
haemorrhages (I61) and unspecified strokes (I64). A stroke was
subclassified as ischaemic (I63) if a CT or MRI scan made
within 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms ruled out other
diagnoses or if indirect evidence (deficit limited to one limb or
complete recovery within 72 h, or atrial fibrillation in the
absence of anticoagulant therapy) indicated the ischaemic
nature of the stroke. Follow-up was complete until 1 January
2005 for 99.0% of potential person years.[27]

Population for analysis
A total of 5685 participants from the Rotterdam Study were
free from stroke and eligible to participate in the third study
survey. Of these, 1045 refused the interview and 140 were
physically unable to participate. Consequently, 4500 participants were given the CESD interview. Incomplete information
on CESD led to the exclusion of 76 participants, leaving a study
population of 4424 for analyses of the association between
depressive symptoms and risk of stroke. Thirty participants
with depressive symptoms did not undergo psychiatric workup,
leaving 4394 participants eligible for analyses of the association
between depressive disorder and risk of stroke.

Statistical analysis
We compared the risk of stroke and ischaemic stroke in
participants with depressive symptoms (CESD score >16) with
the risk of stroke and ischaemic stroke in participants without
depressive symptoms (CESD score,16) using Cox proportional
hazards models Subsequently we repeated these analyses

the DSM-IV. Participants were censored at the time of first ever
stroke, death, study end or loss to follow-up, whichever
occurred first. We performed the analyses for men and women
combined and separately. We adjusted for confounding by age
and sex (model 1), and additionally for confounding by other
putative confounders (systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus,
cigarette smoking (ever), cigarette smoking (current), intima–
media thickness, history of myocardial infarction, history of
PTCA or CABG, history of TIA, antithrombotic drug use,

We replaced missing values in putative confounders by the
geometric mean. We had missing values for intima–media
thickness (20%), systolic blood pressure (12%), MMSE score
(12%) and medication use (8%). Analyses were performed with
SPSS 11.0 for Windows and results expressed as hazard ratios
(HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

RESULTS
During 24 657 person years of follow-up, 291 strokes (190
ischaemic, 31 haemorrhagic and 70 unspecified) occurred. At
baseline, median age was 71.9 years and 60% of participants
were women (see baseline characteristics in table 1). At baseline,
the prevalence (95% CI) of major depression was 0.7% (0.3% to
1.1%) among men and 1.7% (1.2% to 2.2%) among women; the
prevalence (95% CI) of dysthymia was 0.3% (0.04% to 0.5%)


among men and 0.6% (0.3% to 0.9%) among women; and the
prevalence (95% CI) of minor depression was 0.8% (0.4% to
1.2%) among men and 1.6% (1.1% to 2.0%) among women.
Participants with depressive symptoms at baseline had a nonsignificantly higher risk of stroke (age and sex adjusted HR 1.20,
95% CI 0.81 to 1.80) and of ischaemic stroke (age and sex
adjusted HR 1.43, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.31) than participants
without depressive symptoms (table 2). Associations between
depressive symptoms and risk of stroke were stronger in men
than in women (p for interaction 0.05 for stroke and 0.008 for
ischaemic stroke): men with depressive symptoms had a
strongly increased risk of stroke and ischaemic stroke compared
with men without depressive symptoms: the age and sex
adjusted HR was 2.11 (95% CI 1.11 to 4.04) for stroke and 3.09
(95% CI 1.60 to 5.98) for ischaemic stroke. In women, there was
no association between presence of depressive symptoms and
risk of (ischaemic) stroke. HR values were not attenuated by
further adjustment for confounding.
Of all participants with depressive symptoms on CESD, the
subsequent clinical examination showed that only 46% had a
DSM-IV depressive disorder (50% of men and 45% of women);
the remainder had anxiety disorder (n = 21), other axis 1
psychiatric diagnosis (n = 14) or no axis 1 psychiatric diagnosis
(n = 123).
Men who met DSM-IV criteria for depressive disorder were at
increased risk of stroke (age and sex adjusted HR 1.75, 95% CI
0.56 to 5.51; table 3), although this was not statistically

significant at a = 0.05. Men with depressive symptoms who did
not meet DSM-IV criteria were at significantly increased risk of
stroke (age and sex adjusted HR 2.45, 95% CI 1.07 to 5.58).
When only ischaemic strokes were included, both associations
became stronger. Like men, women with depressive symptoms
in the absence of depressive disorder were at higher risk of
stroke than women without depressive symptoms or women
with depressive disorder. However, this was far from statistically significant. Adjustment for duration of symptoms did not
materially change our findings.

DISCUSSION
In this population based study, persons with depressive
symptoms had a slightly but not significantly increased risk of
stroke compared with those without depressive symptoms.
Although there was no association between presence of
depressive symptoms and risk of stroke in women, men with
depressive symptoms were at increased risk of subsequent
stroke and ischaemic stroke compared with men without
depressive symptoms. If anything, the associations between
depressive symptoms in the absence of depressive disorder and
risk of stroke were stronger than the associations between
depressive disorder and risk of stroke.
Some methodological issues need to be discussed before these
results can be interpreted. The strengths of our study were the
large study population (n = 4424), the thorough stroke case
finding, the diagnostic workup for depressive disorder and the
nearly complete follow-up (loss of potential person years was
1%). Stringent stroke monitoring procedures made it possible to
also include stroke patients who were not referred to a
neurologist (31% of all stroke cases). As neuroimaging had not
been performed in these non-referred cases, we subclassified
only 16% of them into ischaemic or haemorrhagic. In contrast,
92% of strokes that had been diagnosed by a neurologist could
be subclassified. For some putative confounding variables we
had incomplete information. This is because participants were
visited at home for the assessment of depressive symptoms and
depressive disorder whereas for most other measurements they
had to attend the research centre. Control of risk factors was
assessed adequately at our research centre. We controlled for
medication that was actually collected from the pharmacies. It
is likely that patients used the medication that they collected,
but we could not verify this. We therefore cannot completely
rule out residual confounding by medication intake. It is
possible that episodes of psychosomatic syndrome may have
been mistaken for stroke. However, all strokes that were
included in the ischaemic stroke analyses underwent extensive
clinical workup, which for almost all of them (93%) included
neuroimaging, and hence we believe it unlikely that in any of
these cases was the true diagnosis psychosomatic syndrome.
Several previous studies reported on the association between
depressive symptoms and stroke: a positive association has been
reported between the presence of depressive symptoms and risk
of fatal stroke,[16 28] and between the presence of depressive
symptoms and stroke in patients with hypertension[18] and in
young persons.[17 29] Three studies were performed in the general
elderly population; one of these found that the risk of stroke
increased with increasing CESD score (adjusted HR 1.23, 95%
CI 1.05 to 1.44 per unit increase in logged CESD score),[13]

another found an adjusted HR of 1.41 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.96)
for stroke risk for highest versus lowest tertile of CESD score[14]

and the most recent one found no association between CESD
score >16 and risk of stroke in subjects 65 years of age and over


mentioned study there was an association between the presence
of depressive symptoms and stroke in participants younger than
65 years of age. We found an association between the presence
of depressive symptoms and the risk of stroke in elderly persons,
but only in men and not in women.
Nearly all of the previous studies used self-reported depressive
symptom scales to assess the presence of depressive symptoms
at baseline and did not study clinical diagnosis of depressive
disorder. In our study, more than half of participants who
scored positive for depressive symptoms on CESD did not have
depressive disorder, confirming earlier reports that the CESD
has an extremely poor positive predictive value for diagnosing
DSM-IV depressive disorders in the general elderly population.[20]

One previous study described the association between depressive disorder and stroke,[29] but this was a small study with
younger participants which only studied fatal or self-reported
stroke.
Many mechanisms have been proposed that could explain the
association between depressive disorder and vascular disease: for
example, depressive disorder has been found to be associated
with smoking,[8] medication non-adherence,[9] more cerebral white
matter lesions,[3 4] increased platelet reactivity,[6] raised cortisol
levels,[5] reduced heart rate variability,[7] hypertension and glucose
intolerance,[30] which can be either causes or consequences of
depressive disorder. According to our analyses, classical vascular
risk factors could not explain the associations we found. As
mentioned, we found a strong association between depressive
symptoms in the absence of depressive disorder and stroke.
Similar mechanisms may play a role here.
Our finding that the association between depressive symptoms in the absence of depressive disorder and risk of stroke
seemed stronger than the association between depressive
disorder and risk of stroke could be a chance finding. There is
no intuitive reason why milder symptoms would have more
impact on health than severe symptoms, in particular since
these depressive symptoms generally did not reflect other
comorbid psychiatric disorders. However, hypoxic brain damage
caused by irreversibly damaged cerebral arteries could cause
depressive symptoms whereas the development of depressive
disorder could be driven more by genetic factors than by
vascular damage. This hypothesis is supported firstly by the
observation that the prevalence of depressive disorder decreases
with age[31] whereas the prevalence of depressive symptoms
increases with age,[32] and secondly, by the observation in our
study population that cerebral perfusion is more impaired in
persons with depressive symptoms than in those with
depressive disorder.[33] However, the subdivision of men and
women, and the subdivision of the screen positives into those
who fulfil DSM-IV criteria for depressive disorder and those
who do not, requires substantial power, and therefore our
results need to be interpreted carefully.
The absence of an association between depressive symptoms
and stroke in women might be attributable to the different, and
probably more heterogeneous, aetiology of depressive symptoms among women compared with men,[22] which is illustrated
by the 2.5-fold excess in prevalence of depressive symptoms in
women (9.4%) compared with men (4.2%): non-biological or
hormonal factors without somatic consequences may play a
larger role in women than in men. These prevalence values are
similar to those reported by others.[34]

In conclusion, the presence of depressive symptoms is an
important risk factor for stroke in men perhaps more so if

disorder. The presence of depressive symptoms is not a risk
factor for stroke in women.
