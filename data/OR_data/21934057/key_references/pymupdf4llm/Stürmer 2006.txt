## Personality, lifestyle, and risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer: follow-up of population based cohort

#### Til Stürmer, Petra Hasselbach, Manfred Amelang


### Abstract

**Objective To study the relation between measures of**
personality and risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in a
large cohort.
**Design Follow-up of population based cohort.**
**Setting Heidelberg, Germany.**
**Participants 5114 women and men aged 40-65 in 1992-5.**
**Main outcome measures Psychological traits assessed by**
several standardised personality questionnaires in 1992-5,
related to cause of death (to 2002-3) or reported incidence of
cardiovascular diseases and cancer (validated by treating
doctors). Relative risks (and 95% confidence intervals) for
combined morbidity and mortality according to five important
personality traits were estimated using multivariable Cox
proportional hazards models.
**Results During median follow-up of 8.5 years, 257 participants**
died and 72 were diagnosed with a heart attack, 62 with stroke,
and 240 with cancer (morbidity and mortality combined). A
high internal locus of control over disease was associated with a
decreased risk of myocardial infarction (adjusted relative risk
for an increase of 1 SD = 0.75; 95% confidence interval 0.58 to
0.96). An increase of 1 SD in time urgency was associated with a
decreased risk of cancer (adjusted relative risk 0.83; 0.73 to
0.95). Other major personality traits—anger control,
psychoticism, and symptoms of depression—were not
consistently associated with myocardial infarction, stroke, or
cancer.
**Conclusion Internal locus of control over disease and time**
urgency seem to be associated with reduced risk for common
chronic diseases, probably by affecting unmeasured health
related behaviour. The other personality traits assessed had no
major impact on cardiovascular disease and cancer.

### Introduction

Medicine and psychology have long been separate disciplines.
Despite the lack of interdisciplinary studies and cooperation,
doctors are aware that psychological traits influence the
incidence and the course of chronic diseases.
A recent large multinational case-control study linked
permanent stress at work or home during the past year to
increased incidence of myocardial infarction.1 The size of the
effect of psychosocial factors was similar to that seen for
abdominal obesity, diabetes, and hypertension.2 The proposed
pathophysiological links between psychological stress and
cardiovascular disease include clustering of “traditional” risk factors, endothelial dysfunction, myocardial ischaemia, plaque rupture, thrombosis, and malignant arrhythmias.3 4


Evidence for a link between psychological factors and cancer
is weak. A recent review concluded that “there is not any psychological factor for which an influence on cancer development has
been convincingly demonstrated in a series of studies.”5 A metaanalysis of stressful life events and risk of breast cancer did not
support an overall association between such events and breast
cancer, except for a modestly increased risk with the death of a
spouse.6 In a large population based cohort study from
Denmark, the incidence of cancer was 18% higher in mothers
7-18 years after the death of a child.7

We hypothesised that personality differences influence the
incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer, independent of “traditional” risk factors. We empirically
derived five personality scales that measure different independent personality traits8 and present results on all five scales
without selection according to the strength of association with
the disease outcomes.

### Methods

Recruitment and follow-up of the cohort have been described.8

Briefly, we identified a representative sample of women and men
aged 40-65 from the population registry of Heidelberg,
Germany. Between 1992 and 1995, 5114 of these people
completed an extensive baseline questionnaire on psychological
traits, lifestyle factors, and comorbidity. All participants provided
written informed consent to assess their health status 10 years
later, including assessment of causes of death.
In 2002, we mailed a follow-up questionnaire to all
participants and asked for information about chronic diseases
that had been diagnosed since baseline. All participants who did
not reply and could not be reached by telephone were followed
up through population registries.

**Personality variables**
The personality scales used at baseline were selected for several
reasons.8 Some scales were markers of broad aspects of personality (extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism). Other scales had
been used in research on health outcomes (scales to measure
depression, time urgency, hostility, anger out, low sense of coherence, and irritability), some were hypothesised to be relevant
(scales to measure optimism, anger in, anger control, social support, exaggerated social control, internal and external locus of
control over disease, jealousy), and others were important with
respect to response style (scales to measure social desirability).

### Research

Since many of these personality scales overlap and are highly
correlated, we aggregated the information contained in these
scales (by using factor analysis) to obtain five broad independent
dimensions of personality.8 These dimensions are unique to the
population from which they were derived. To make it possible to
compare our results with reports in the literature, we used the
personality scales that were most strongly correlated with these
five broad dimensions, rather than the dimensions themselves.
Both the derivation of the dimensions and the selection of scales
relied solely on cross sectional baseline data (that is, were
independent of the disease outcomes), and results are presented
for all scales assessed.

**Morbidity and mortality**
We validated all diagnoses of myocardial infarction, stroke, and
cancer that had occurred since baseline by contacting the treating doctors (with the written informed consent of participants).
Mortality follow-up was 99.6% (22 participants moved to an
unknown address or left the country); we assessed the cause of
death from death certificates for 98.8% of participants who had
died. Two doctors coded the cause of death according to ICD-10
(international classification of diseases, 10th revision), and
inconsistencies were resolved by discussion.

**Covariates**
We assessed the risk factors for chronic diseases that might be
associated with personality variables at baseline. Besides age and
sex, these were body mass index; smoking status; alcohol
consumption (amount of beer, wine, and spirits drunk each
week); exercise (hours each week); comorbidity (history of myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia,
and diabetes); family history of myocardial infarction, stroke, and
cancer; and education (years of schooling).

**Statistical analyses**
For each participant, we calculated the time to death, diagnosis of
disease, or end of follow-up, whichever came first. We used Cox
proportional hazards models to assess the association between
each personality scale (in thirds or as a continuous variable) and
the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cancer. We
excluded participants with the disease at baseline or in whom the
incidence of disease could not be assessed because of missing
information (247 for myocardial infarction, 274 for stroke, and
256 for cancer).

### Results

Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the 4267
participants who replied to the follow-up questionnaire or died
during follow-up (83.4% of the original cohort). Mean age was
53.4 years; 51.5% were women. Risk factors for chronic diseases,
such as overweight or obesity, smoking, no regular physical exercise, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and a family history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cancer were common.
Table 2 shows the distribution of the five personality scales
according to baseline characteristics (actual patient numbers are
shown in table A on bmj.com). All scales were divided into low,
medium, or high according to the observed distribution (with
one third of participants in each category, except for
psychoticism, which was split into 22%, 53%, and 26%). Older
age was strongly associated with more symptoms of depression
and higher anger control. Women were more likely than men to
have more symptoms of depression, and men were more likely to
have higher anger control, higher time urgency, and higher
internal locus of control over disease (the patient’s belief that the

category and one used the z transformed scores from the original personality scale as a continuous variable, so that the relative

the personality scale. The first set of analyses assesses
non-monotonic trends and the second assumes a monotonic
log-linear trend.
Anger control, time urgency, and symptoms of depression
were not associated with the incidence of myocardial infarction
(table 3). Participants with a low internal locus of control over

increase of 1 SD in internal locus of control over disease was

None of the personality scales was strongly associated with
the incidence of stroke (table 4). Higher values of symptoms of

Table 5 shows that anger control, internal locus of control
over disease, psychoticism, and symptoms of depression were not
associated with cancer. Time urgency was inversely associated
with the risk of cancer; participants with high time urgency had
a relative risk for cancer of 0.68 (0.49 to 0.95) compared with
those with medium time urgency, and an increase in time
urgency of 1 SD was associated with an adjusted relative risk for
cancer of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95).

### Discussion

In a large, population based cohort study with a median
follow-up of 8.5 years (during which 257 participants died, 72
had a heart attack, 62 had a stroke, and 240 developed cancer)
some personality traits were risk factors for morbidity and mortality, independent of lifestyle factors. A low internal locus of
control over disease and high and low psychoticism were risk
factors for myocardial infarction. A high time urgency was associated with reduced risk of developing cancer. Overall, however,
the personality traits had no major impact on the incidence of
and mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer.

**Comparison with other studies**
Research on personality variables as risk factors for cardiovascular disease has focused on stress, social support, low sense of
coherence, and hardiness.9 Findings from the Western Collaborative Group study and the Framingham heart study seemed to
establish type A behaviour (the triad of competitive ambition,
time urgency, and hostility) as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.10 11 But at least one large study (MRFIT; multiple risk factor


intervention trial) found no association, and a later analysis of
the Western Collaborative Group study found that the
association between type A behaviour and all cause mortality is
more complex.12 13 Because type A behaviour has now been
deconstructed, we analysed anger control (inversely associated
with hostility) and time urgency separately.9 Neither personality
trait was associated with cardiovascular disease, so we cannot
confirm the finding of an increased risk of non-fatal myocardial
infarction with increasing time urgency seen in a recent
case-control study.14

A high internal locus of control over disease has consistently
been linked with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.9 Our
results on myocardial infarction agree with those on control over
life circumstances (not disease) seen in a large case-control
study.1 Residual confounding by healthy behaviours apart from
those that we (and others) could control for is a likely
explanation for at least part of the reduced risk.
Our finding of increased risk for myocardial infarction with
increasing psychoticism needs to be interpreted with caution
because of the inconsistency of the results. The analysis based on
dividing participants into thirds does not indicate a monotonic
association, so that the analysis assuming a monotonic (log
linear) trend is probably driven by influential observations at the
high end of the highly skewed scale. High values of psychoticism
have been associated with less health conscious behaviour in at
least one study, but not with myocardial infarction.15

Our finding of no association between personality traits and
stroke is especially interesting in the light of emerging research
on the individual components of composite end points and the
greater contribution of stroke than myocardial infarction to
overall risk of cardiovascular disease in women.16

*64 participants had stroke at baseline; 274 participants lacked information on incident stroke during follow-up; 62 incident cases of stroke (no deaths) occurred.
†Incidence rate ratios and their 95% confidence intervals from Cox proportional hazards model controlling for all variables in table 1: age (continuous), sex, body mass index (3 categories),

A recent review of the association between psychological factors and cancer concluded that life events (other than loss of a
spouse or child), negative emotional states, fighting spirit, stoic
acceptance or fatalism, active coping, personality factors, and
locus of control have little influence on whether people develop
cancer or not.5 We found that a high time urgency was associated
with a lower risk of cancer, but the strength of the association was
moderate, and risk was not increased in the category of low time
urgency. High time urgency has been associated with a decreased
risk for all cause mortality in women after myocardial infarction
but not with a decreased risk for any type of cancer.17 High time
urgency might be associated with delayed diagnosis and thus
lower incidence of cancer. Secondary analyses restricted to 83
deaths caused by cancer showed similar results, but with an
adjusted hazards ratio of 0.58 (0.32 to 1.05) for high versus
medium time urgency and of 0.80 (0.64 to 1.00) for an increase
of 1 SD. By looking at cancer overall, we may have missed associations with individual types of cancer. A meta-analysis found a
modest increase in risk of breast cancer after the death of a
spouse but did not support an overall association between stressful life events and risk of breast cancer.6 A previous review
reached similar conclusions.18

**Limitations**
We lack information on important risk factors for cardiovascular
disease and cancer, including blood lipids, markers of subclinical
systemic inflammation, diet, and use of drugs (for example, low
dose aspirin, statins) during follow-up. Whereas an association
between personality variables and biological markers is unlikely,
personality variables could be associated with long term use of
preventive drugs, screening practices, and reporting of
symptoms.19 It might be better not to control for such covariates
that are consequences rather than confounders.


Despite the population based recruitment, participants probably do not represent the whole range of personalities in the
population. We might have missed associations between extreme
patterns of these traits and disease.

**Implications**
Psychological traits such as the personality variables considered
in our analysis are probably stable over time and are likely to
have a genetic component.20 21 The more these traits are
predetermined, the more they should be seen as part of a risk
prediction rather than be used for “victim blaming”. Life events
seem to influence the stability of these traits, and some events
(such as becoming unemployed) might be avoidable at the level
of the individual or society.20 22 We assessed personality variables
at baseline with an extensive list of validated scales under standardised conditions, and we used factor analysis to find five
personality scales as indicators for five independent personality
dimensions without information on outcomes.8 An analysis that
adjusted for multiple comparisons found no statistically
significant association. We did not adjust the results for multiple
comparisons because it is unlikely that all associations between
personality traits and disease are random, because we chose all
scales without knowledge of the outcomes, and because we
present all the associations that we evaluated.23

Mortality and morbidity follow-up were almost complete and
the incidence of the chronic diseases was validated, so the
estimates of relative risks should be valid, even if we missed some
events.
We adjusted our analyses for various lifestyle factors at baseline (smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, physical
exercise, and education). Since the personality variables and
these lifestyle factors were assessed at the same time, we cannot
tell how personality variables influenced these lifestyle factors.

*242 participants had cancer at baseline; 256 participants lacked information on incident cancer during follow-up; 240 incident cases of myocardial infarction (including 83 deaths) occurred.
†Incidence rate ratios and their 95% confidence intervals from Cox proportional hazards model controlling for all variables in table 1: age (continuous), sex, body mass index (3 categories),
smoking status (never, former, current), alcohol consumption (4 categories), exercise (4 categories), comorbidity (history of stroke, cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and diabetes), family

Psychological traits probably influence the risk of disease only
after long latency periods, but they might have more immediate
effects through variables such as lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, and weight).24 We therefore adjusted for age
and sex only as well as for these two factors plus lifestyle factors.
Repeated measures and more sophisticated models are needed
to determine the causal effect of personality differences on the
risk of disease.
