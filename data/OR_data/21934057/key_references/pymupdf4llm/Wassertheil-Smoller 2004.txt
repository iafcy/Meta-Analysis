**Background: Subclinical depression, often clinically un-**
recognized, may pose increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Few studies have prospectively investigated cardiovascular events related to depression in older women.
We describe prevalence, cardiovascular correlates, and
relationship to subsequent cardiovascular events of depressive symptoms among generally healthy postmenopausal women.

**Methods: The Women’s Health Initiative Observa-**
tional Study followed up 93676 women for an average
of 4.1 years. Depression was measured at baseline with
a short form of the Center for Epidemiological Studies
Depression Scale. Risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
events were estimated from Cox proportional hazards
models adjusting for multiple demographic, clinical, and
risk factor covariates.


pression was significantly related to CVD risk and comorbidity (odds ratios ranging from 1.12 for hypertension to
1.60 for history of stroke or angina). Among women with
no history of CVD, depression was an independent predictor of CVD death (relative risk, 1.50) and all-cause mortality(relativerisk,1.32)afteradjustmentforage,race,education, income, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, high
cholesterol level requiring medication, body mass index,
and physical activity. Taking antidepressant medications
did not alter the depression-associated risks associated.

**Conclusions: A large proportion of older women re-**
port levels of depressive symptoms that are significantly
related to increased risk of CVD death and all-cause mortality, even after controlling for established CVD risk factors. Whether early recognition and treatment of subclinical depression will lower CVD risk remains to be
determined in clinical trials.


**Results: Current depressive symptoms above the screen-**
ing cutoff point were reported by 15.8% of women. De- _Arch Intern Med. 2004;164:289-298_

**METHODS**


**STUDY POPULATION**

The WHI-OS cohort of 93676 participants is multiethnic, with
0.5% American Indian–Alaskan Native, 8.2% African American, 2.9% Asian–Pacific Islander, 3.9% Hispanic, 83.3% white,
and 1.4% unknown. Postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years
who gave written informed consent were recruited into the WHI
at 40 clinical centers in the United States, mostly through mass
mailings to age-eligible women from large mailing lists. Details of the WHI design are reported elsewhere.[8] Exclusions were
participation in other randomized trials, predicted survival of
less than 3 years, alcoholism, drug dependency, diagnosed mental illness, dementia, or other conditions making women unable to participate in the study.

**DEFINITIONS OF VARIABLES**

Depressive symptoms in the past week were assessed with a
scale that used 6 items from the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D),[8-11] which is commonly used in epidemiologic studies,[12] and 2 items from the
Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS).[13] For the CES-D, participants are asked how often they have felt each of the feelings
listed below during the past week. Each item is scored as 0 (rarely
or none of the time [�1 day]), 1 (some or a little of the time

[1-2 days]), 2 (occasionally or a moderate amount of the time

[3-4 days]), or 3 (most or all of the time [5-7 days]).

1. You felt depressed.
2. Your sleep was restless.
3. You enjoyed life (reversed scoring).
4. You had crying spells.
5. You felt sad.
6. You felt that people disliked you.

The DIS items were as follows:

1. In the past year, have you had 2 weeks or more during
which you felt sad, blue, or depressed or lost pleasure in things
that you usually cared about or enjoyed? (0, no; 1, yes)
2. Have you had 2 years or more in your life when you
felt depressed or sad most days, even if you felt okay sometimes? (0, no; 1, yes) If yes, have you felt depressed or sad much
of the time in the past year? (0, no; 1, yes)

These items were administered at baseline as part of an
extensive behavioral and psychosocial questionnaire to all
women enrolling in the WHI and were originally selected for
this questionnaire because they are used in a logistic regression equation[14] for a depression-screening algorithm developed by Burnam and colleagues.[14] In this report, we have chosen to use only the 6 CES-D items as an index of current
depression, rather than the algorithm, because the CES-D is commonly used in epidemiologic studies and will make our results comparable with those of other surveys. The 2 DIS items,
which ask about feelings of sadness or depression for 2 or more
weeks in the past year and feelings of sadness on most days for
2 or more years, are stem questions for major depression and
for dysthymia, respectively.[13] We combined the 2 DIS items separately, so that a person responding “yes” to both items was classified as having “history of depression.”
The 6 CES-D items have been found to correlate with the
full 20-item scale with r=0.88 (unpublished data, available from
S.W.-S., 2000), in a population similar to that of the WHI, consisting of 2682 women aged 60 to 79 years who were participants in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program
(SHEP).[15] The distribution of CES-D scores is skewed, and a


p g
for depression is a score of 16 or greater[7,9,10] of a possible maximum score of 60. In the short-form CES-D used here, we use
a cutoff point of 5 (of a possible 18), which corresponds to the
cutoff point of 16 on the full scale. In the SHEP sample, there
was 95% agreement in classification as depressed with the cutoff point of 16 or greater on the 20-item scale and with the cutoff point of 5 or greater on the 6-item short scale. This is a screening instrument, which may also reflect anxiety or psychological
distress, and if used clinically, persons with CES-D above the
cutoff point would generally be referred for further psychiatric evaluation. Thus, the screening result does not in itself constitute clinical depression. For notational convenience, in this
report we use the term current depression for women who have
a score of 5 or more on the short form of the CES-D.
Treatment for depression was determined from medications. Women were asked to bring in their original pill bottles
to the baseline visit, and the label information was entered into
the pharmacy database (Master Drug Data Base; Medi-Span, Indianapolis, Ind). Antidepressants included treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, modified cyclics, selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic agents, and any other miscellaneous medications classified as antidepressants.
Hypertensive subjects were defined as those who had elevated blood pressure at the baseline clinic visit (systolic blood
pressure �140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure �90 mm
Hg) and/or self-reported that they were taking medications for
hypertension. Treated hypertensive subjects were those among
the hypertensive individuals who reported that they were taking pills for high blood pressure. All women were asked to bring
all the prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs and
supplements they were taking to the baseline visit. Self-report
of taking antihypertensive medication was confirmed for 85%
of women by the medications they brought in that fell into the
antihypertensive drug categories.
History of various CVD events was obtained by selfreport on baseline questionnaires. Height, weight, and blood
pressure were measured at the baseline visit. High cholesterol
level was defined as self-report of having a high cholesterol level
requiring pills; we did not have blood measures of cholesterol
in the entire WHI-OS cohort. Overweight was defined as body
mass index (BMI) greater than 27.3 (measured as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). Physical
activity was assessed by questions ascertaining episodes per
week of moderate or strenuous activity (defined by a metabolic equivalent score of at least 4.0 as indicated by Ainsworth
and colleagues[16]) of at least 20 minutes’ duration. One metabolic equivalent is the amount of energy expended sitting quietly at rest, adjusted to body weight, equal to 1 kcal/kg per
hour. Women reporting some recreational activity but of
shorter duration and/or lesser intensity were classified as having “some activity.”

**END POINT ASCERTAINMENT**

Potential outcomes were identified from annual Medical History Update questionnaires, or participant or third-party reports directly to clinic staff in the intervals between questionnaires, followed by obtaining medical record information.
Participant fatalities were identified through communication
with proxy respondents and also through the National Death
Index searches. Vital status was available for 98.2% of respondents as of February 28, 2001. Packets of complete information were prepared and presented to physician adjudicators at
the clinical sites who made the decision on cause of event. End
points were the first occurrence of the following: congestive
heart failure; coronary heart disease (CHD), defined as fatal or
nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI); coronary artery disease,

defined as MI or coronary death, angina, coronary artery bypass grafting, or angioplasty; stroke, fatal or nonfatal; and CVD
death, defined as death caused by definite or possible CHD, cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary embolism, or other or unknown type of CVD. Follow-up was on average 4.1 years (SD,
1.2 years; interquartile range, 3.0-4.9 years; maximum follow-up time, 6.9 years).

**STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**

Prevalence of depression and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
are presented for demographic subgroups. Logistic regression
models were run with baseline depression as the dependent
variable, to determine odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for
lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors, and for history of
cardiovascular conditions. Kaplan-Meier survival curves
were obtained for stroke, cardiovascular death, and all-cause
mortality.
To determine the effect of depression on subsequent cardiovascular events, Cox proportional hazards models were
run to obtain relative risks (RRs) of CVD end points associated with depression, controlling for age, race, education,
income. Additional models were run, further controlling for
variables significantly related to depression and known to be
related to CVD outcomes: diabetes, hypertension, smoking,
high cholesterol level requiring medications, BMI, physical
activity, and hormone use. Some models also included use of
antidepressant medications. We did not include in these multivariate analyses variables that are presumed from past expe

**PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSED MOOD**

Overall, 15.8% (95% CI, 15.6%-16.0%) of women reported current depressed mood at baseline (Table 1)
and 12.3% (95% CI, 12.1-12.5) reported history of depressed mood.


rience to be collinear or intermediate in the pathway relating
depression to CVD events, such as self-reported health, disability, or alcohol use (which has a U-shaped relationship
with some cardiovascular events), as control for such variables may distort the effect estimates of depression. The objective of these analyses was to see whether effects of depression
on CVD end points remained after accounting for the established risk factors.
Models were run separately for those with and without history of CVD. Depression in the Cox models was defined as current or history of depression. The reference group was characterized by not being currently above the cutoff score of 5 or
more on the CES-D 6-item screen and not having a history of
depression at baseline as measured by the 2 DIS items. For events
that were significantly related to depression in these analyses,
models were also run excluding events in the first 6 months
after baseline measure of depression. In some analyses, where
specified, depression was defined as current or history of depression or taking antidepressant medication.

and American Indian–Alaskan Native women and lowest among Asian–Pacific Islanders. There was an inverse dose-response relationship of depression to age, education (ranging from 12.7% for current depression of those
with a college degree or higher to 29.9% of those with
less than an eighth grade education), and income. History of depression followed the same pattern. The results that follow pertain to baseline current depressed
mood unless otherwise noted.

**DEPRESSION AND CARDIOVASCULAR**
**RISK FACTORS**

Lifestyle cardiovascular risk and protective factors were
all related to current depression (Table 2) at baseline
after adjustment for age, race, education, and income. Both
being overweight and smoking were significantly related to depression. Compared with nonoverweight nonsmokers, those both overweight and currently smoking
had 1.56 times the risk of current depression (95% CI,
1.39-1.75).
There was an inverse dose-response relationship of
depression and exercise level, which, compared with nonexercisers, ranged from only 0.56 the risk among those
who had 4 or more episodes of moderate or strenuous
activity of at least 20 minutes’ duration, to 0.67 for those
with 2 to 4 such episodes and 0.78 for those who reported some activity. The CIs did not overlap. The same
relationships held true for history of depression. All of
these ORs for cardiovascular lifestyle risk factors remained substantially unchanged when further adjusted
for diabetes, arthritis, and history of CVD. Nevertheless, self-reported fair or poor health, compared with excellent or very good health, was strongly associated with
depression (OR, 4.73) (data not shown).
Compared with no medication use, current unopposed estrogen use was associated with a greater risk of
current depression (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.18-1.32) as was
use of estrogen plus progesterone (OR, 1.07; 95% CI,
1.00-1.74). Since unopposed estrogen is most often used
in women who have had a hysterectomy, the higher risk
of depression among these women may be partly associated with the hysterectomy. Therefore, we compared
logistic regressions for women with a uterus and without a uterus separately (data not displayed). The OR for
depression in women using unopposed estrogen who had
a uterus was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.11-1.54), and for those without a uterus it was 1.17 (95% CI, 1.07-1.28).
Comorbid cardiovascular risk factors, adjusted for
age, race, education, and income, were all significantly
related to reported depression, ranging from OR of 1.12
for hypertensive subjects compared with normotensive
individuals to an OR of 1.50 for individuals with confirmed diabetes (ie, those being treated for diabetes with
pills or shots) compared with nondiabetic subjects. History of various forms of CVD was strongly associated with
risk of depression (Table 3). Women with a history of
angina were 57% more likely to report current depression than those without a history of CVD. Higher ORs
for depression were also found for those with a history
of MI (OR, 1.45), stroke (OR, 1.60), atrial fibrillation (OR,

pass surgery (ORs, 1.41, 1.57, and 1.28, respectively), or
congestive heart failure (OR, 1.63). To determine whether
the increased risk of depression among those with CVD is
specific to CVD conditions, we also looked at cancer and
at stomach or duodenal ulcer and depression (not
displayed).TheORforcurrentdepressionamongthosewith
a history of cancer vs no cancer was 1.14 (95% CI,
1.08-1.21). The OR for current depression and history of
stomach or duodenal ulcer was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.42-1.62).
This suggests that history of various morbidities may lead
to reported current depression.

**TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION**
**AND CRUDE EVENT RATES**

Of the entire cohort, 7.7% (95% CI, 7.5%-7.8%) were taking antidepressive medications. Of the 14764 women who
were above the cutoff point for depression on the 6-item
CES-D screen, 14.7% (95% CI, 14.2%-15.3%) were taking these drugs compared with 6.3% of those who did not
meet the cutoff point for depression on the CES-D screen.
Of the 7043 women taking antidepressant medications,
49.9% were taking SSRIs (data not displayed). Table 4
shows the crude event rates for those with current depression or a history of depression and for those not depressed. For each event except cancer, the unadjusted rates
were higher for those depressed than for those not depressed.
The Figure displays Kaplan-Meier survival curves
for those depressed and not depressed for the entire cohort. For stroke the curves begin to diverge after about
1 year, for cardiovascular death after about 6 months, and
for all-cause mortality before 6 months. The curves, particularly of cardiovascular deaths, become more separate over time, indicating that the effect of depression is
not just immediately after the baseline measurement.

**PROSPECTIVE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR**
**END POINTS IN RELATION**
**TO BASELINE DEPRESSION**

To determine whether depression is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, we ran Cox proportional hazards models to obtain RRs of these events for
those who reported depressive symptoms at baseline
(score �5 on CES-D items or reporting history of depressed mood). The reference group consisted of those
neither depressed at baseline nor reporting history of depressed mood on the screening instrument. Because the
interaction between history of CVD and depression was
significant in models on coronary disease, and because
a history of CVD may cause depression, we considered
those without and with history of CVD separately
(n=73098 and 18572, respectively) (Table 5).
Among women with no history of CVD, baseline depression adjusted for age and race was associated with a
58% higher risk of CVD death (RR, 1.58; 95% CI,
1.19-2.10). The association remained significant after additional adjustment for education and income (RR, 1.52;
95% CI, 1.13-2.05). Further adjustment for diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and high cholesterol level requir

for the association of depression with cardiovascular death
among those with no history of CVD at baseline. Censoring events that occurred in the first 6 months after the
baseline measure of depression also did not affect the risk
(RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.12-2.10). In models additionally adjusting for being treated for depression, the RR was essentially unchanged (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.03-1.91; not
displayed). For comparison purposes, in these models
the adjusted RR of CVD death for hypertension was 2.19
(95% CI, 1.64-2.93); for diabetes, 2.54 (95% CI, 1.604.03); and for current smoking, 3.66 (95% CI, 2.395.62); adjusted RRs were not significant for BMI, income, education, race, or ethnicity (data not shown).
Depression, controlling for the multiple covariates, was also independently associated with all-cause mortality (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.16-1.52). In models where the
definition of depression also included those taking antidepressant medications, even if their current depressive symptoms were below the cutoff point, controlling
for age, race, and the CVD risk factors, the risks were similar for cardiovascular death (RR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.232.13) and for all-cause mortality (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.181.51) (data not displayed).
The RR for coronary disease of baseline depression, adjusted for age and race, education income, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, high cholesterol level requiring medications, BMI, physical activity, and hormone
use, was elevated but lower than for mortality outcomes
(RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.97-1.29). Additionally adjusting for
taking antidepressant medication did not affect this risk
estimate (RR, 1.11). For these end points, the estab

lished risk factors did not explain the elevated risks associated with depression.
For those who had a history of CVD, depression
(controlling for age and race, education, and income) was
independently and significantly associated with congestive heart failure, stroke, CVD death, and all-cause mortality; however, with adjustment for multiple risk factors, these RRs were reduced and depression remained
significantly and independently related only to stroke (RR,
1.45; 95% CI, 1.11-1.90), even when events in the first
6 months were excluded (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.05-1.87).
For models that indicated a significant relationship of depression and the event after controlling for all the covariates noted above, interactions were examined between depression and the known risk factors; none was
significant at the .01 level (which was selected to adjust
for multiple testing). In contrast to CVD events, depression did not predict cancer incidence or death, either for
those with or without a history of CVD, either with adjustment for age, race, education, and income or with full
adjustment.


**COMMENT**


The WHI-OS of 93676 women represents the largest cohort of postmenopausal women followed up prospec

tively who had baseline measures of depression and rigorously adjudicated outcome events. Our major findings
are that (1) prevalence of depressive symptoms on a
screening instrument is quite high, at 16%; (2) depression is significantly related to risk factors for CVD and
history of cardiovascular morbidity; and (3) among those
with no previous CVD, depression is an independent predictor of CVD and all-cause mortality. For those with a
history of CVD, baseline depressive symptoms are significantly associated with stroke.
In the WHI, the 15.8% prevalence of reported
depressive symptoms on a short form of the CES-D
among women aged 50 to 79 years is within the range
of 5% to 30% prevalence of possible depression, depending on age-sex-race groups, found in several other
studies.[17-20] Hispanic and American Indian–Alaskan Native women had the highest rates of depression, while
Asian–Pacific Islanders had the lowest rates, similar to
other studies.[7,18,21]
We found that older women with established risk
factors for CVD, such as smoking, obesity, low physical
activity, hypertension, high cholesterol level, and diabetes, had an approximately 20% to 50% higher OR for current depression after adjustment for age, race, education, and income. Low income (adjusting for age, race,
and education) and low educational level (adjusting for
age, race, and income) were highly related to depression, but in our cohort they were not related to cardiovascular end points after adjustment for other risk factors. Similarly, women who have a history of various forms
of CVD, such as angina, MI, revascularization, or stroke,
also have higher odds of current depression. However,
women with a history of cancer or ulcer also have higher
risk of current depression, suggesting that several chronic
disease conditions may lead to depressive symptoms.
Compared with women who reported their health to be
excellent, women who reported their health as being fair
or poor were 4.8 times as likely to report depression (38%
of them reported depression) as were those who reported their health as excellent (10%) (data not displayed).
It is important to note that persons with diagnosed
mental illness were excluded from the WHI; therefore,
the depression index used herein assesses subclinical depressive symptoms. We have found, in an average of 4.1
years of follow-up, that such symptoms are significant

independent predictors of CVD events. Because CVD may
be a cause of depression, and because several studies have
found that post-MI depression carries a poorer prognosis than that for patients after MI who are not depressed,[22] we performed separate analyses for women who
had no history of CVD. It should be noted, however, that
we cannot completely rule out the possibility that even
among those with no history of CVD, undetected CVD
may have caused depression.
Other smaller studies have reported results similar
to ours.[23] In the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures of 7518
white women aged 67 years or older with a 6-year followup, the investigators found an 80% higher risk associated with depression for cardiovascular deaths after adjustment for multiple covariates, but found no association
with deaths from cancer.[23] In our study of 93726 women,
we found a 50% increased risk of CVD deaths associated with depression among women with no previous
CVD, and we also found no association with cancer incidence or deaths, although a Finnish study[24] did find a
higher risk of lung cancer associated with depression. The
Glostrup study from Denmark[25] followed up 409 men and
321 women for 27 years and found that a 2-SD difference in depression scores measured at baseline was associated with a 71% increase in MI and a 59% increase
in deaths from all causes, with no difference in effect sizes
for men and women. The long-lasting nature of this effect
suggested to the authors that this risk factor represents
a chronic psychological characteristic.


Four large prospective studies that used the CES-D,
which was the measure of depression used in the WHI,
looked at the association of heart disease and depression: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,[26] the Cardiovascular Health Study,[27] the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the
Elderly,[28] and the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly
Program.[29]
In the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey I, 5007 women and 2886 men recruited from 1982
through 1984 were studied for CHD through 1992 and
were free of CHD at baseline.[26] The adjusted RRs, from
Cox proportional hazards models, for all nonfatal CHD
events were similar in women (RR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.112.68) and in men (RR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.14-2.56). However, for fatal CHD events it was 0.74 (0.40-1.48) and
2.34 (1.54-3.56), respectively, for women and men.
In the Cardiovascular Health Study,[27] 5888 men and
women older than 65 years were recruited and followed
up for 6 years, of whom 4493 were free of known heart
disease at baseline. The investigators found that for every 5-units-higher mean depression score on the CES-D,
after adjustment for multiple covariates, the hazard ratios for CHD and all-cause mortality were 1.15 and 1.16,
respectively (P=.006). There was no interaction with sex.
The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, a clinical trial of antihypertensive therapy in 4367 generally
healthy men and women 60 years or older, with an average follow-up of 4.5 years, found that a 5-point in

crease in CES-D during the trial significantly increased
risk of stroke or MI (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.08-1.30), after
excluding those with events during the first 6 months
and controlling for multiple covariates. Increase in CES-D
score was an independent predictor of death, stroke, or
MI in both placebo and drug-treated groups.[7]
However, data from the Established Populations for
Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly longitudinal study[28]
of 4162 men and women 65 years or older at baseline
found that after adjustment for multiple covariates, CES-D
depression was not associated with mortality in either sex,
although it was significantly and directly associated in
analyses without control for other variables, but subthreshold depression was negatively related to mortality in women but not men. It is difficult to compare these
results with ours because the definition of subthreshold
depression used in that report may not be equivalent to
what we label as subclinical depression. The subthreshold depression was based on number rather than severity of symptoms, and we used a different cutoff point. It
is also possible that differences in control variables used
in the 2 studies may have resulted in different effect estimates. In contrast, another 7-year prospective study of
2558 individuals 65 years or older, reported by Unutzer
and colleagues,[30] showed that mild to moderate baseline depression did not have an effect on mortality, but
more severe depressive symptoms were associated with
significant increases in mortality. Thus, these studies show
somewhat inconsistent results, with the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey indicating no effect
of CES-D score on subsequent fatal CHD events in women


and a large effect in men, the Cardiovascular Health Study
showing modest effects on CVD events in women, and
Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the
Elderly showing no effect of higher depression scores on
mortality, but an inverse effect for subthreshold depression in women.
In our study, where the follow-up was for an average of 4.1 years and which is substantially larger than other
prospective studies to date (N=93676), the adjusted RR
for all-cause mortality was 1.32 and for CVD deaths was
1.50 among those with no history of CVD, substantially
higher than in the Cardiovascular Health Study. While
there are somewhat inconsistent results across studies,
partly due to different cutoff points in depression measures and possibly to differences in population characteristics, the weight of the overall evidence seems to show
that subclinical depression increases risk of subsequent
morbidity and mortality, and our study supports that conclusion.
Given the mounting evidence that depression is an
independent risk factor for cardiovascular events in those
both with and without a history of CVD, there is growing interest in whether treatment of depression may lower
risk. There is also growing interest in identifying depression in a primary care setting.[31] The suggestion that
SSRIs may confer a protective effect against MI comes from
a report by Sauer and colleagues[32] of a case-control study
in 30- to 65-year-old smokers of 653 cases of first MI and
2990 controls. The investigators found an OR of 0.35
among current SSRI users compared with nonusers after adjustment for multiple covariates. The Enhancing

y y y,
jective was to determine the effect of treatment for depression and social support with cognitive behavioral
therapy and SSRIs[33] on subsequent morbidity and mortality in patients after MI (N=2481), has reported no effect
on event-free survival. There have been no clinical trials
addressing this issue in women with no history of heart
disease. In our prospective analyses, controlling for use
of antidepressants did not alter the RRs of subsequent
events associated with baseline depression. It is possible
that women who report depressive symptoms are less adherent to medications for other cardiovascular risk factors, which then puts them at greater risk of CVD events.
We controlled for baseline risk factor status and lifestyle variables that affected CVD risk in our analyses, but
had no measures of adherence to medications.
Various biological mechanisms have been suggestedtolinkdepressionanddepressivesymptomstoCHD.
Two main avenues are through the effects of depression
on lipid metabolism and through altered sympathetic
arousal in depressed patients.[34,35] Mechanisms of increased risk of death in patients with depression after MI
may include arrhythmia.[36,37] Alteration in the ratio between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone may make
patients more susceptible to arrhythmia by lowering the
threshold for ventricular fibrillation.[38,39] Increased platelet aggregation may also be a contributory factor.[40] Another mechanism that is gaining attention is an inflammatory process. High C-reactive protein level, which is a
marker of inflammation, has been found to be predictive
ofCVD[41] andpossiblymayberelatedtodepression.Astudy
from Germany by Rothermundt and colleagues[42] failed to
support the hypothesis that major depression is associated with global inflammation as measured by C-reactive
protein,althoughpatientswithonetypeofdepression(nonmelancholic) did show higher levels of C-reactive protein than healthy controls. This is an area that merits further investigation.
In conclusion, we have found, in the largest multiethnic volunteer cohort of older women to date, that subclinical depression is a prevalent condition that is related to cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular
comorbidity. It is an independent risk factor for subsequent cardiovascular death, particularly in those who have
no history of CVD, at a lower level than diabetes or hypertension and at a higher level than BMI, income, education, race, or ethnicity. Whether treatment with antidepressants of those with no history of CVD will lower
the risks remains to be determined in a randomized clinical trial of this question.

**_Correction_**


**Error in “Results” Section. In the Original Investigation by Fick et al titled**
“Updating the Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in
Older Adults,” published in the December 8/22 issue of the ARCHIVES (2003;
163:2716-2724), an error occurred in the “Results” section on page 2720. The
second full sentence in the left column should have read “Reserpine was changed
to be avoided only at doses greater than 0.25 mg, and disopyramide phosphate
avoidance now only refers to the non–extended release formulation.” This correction was made previously to online versions of this article.
