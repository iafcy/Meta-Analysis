**_Background and Purpose—Psychological distress is common after stroke, but little is known about its etiologic_**
importance, although the general public often ascribes stroke to the experience of stress. Therefore, we examined
whether psychological distress leads to an increased risk of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA).
**_Methods—The association between the 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), a measure of psychological distress,_**
and the incidence of nonfatal and fatal ischemic stroke and TIA was measured by Cox regression modeling in a
prospective observational study of 2201 men aged 45 to 59 years in phase II of the Caerphilly cohort. Hazard ratios
comparing those with high (�5) and normal GHQ scores were calculated with adjustment for age and other covariates.
**_Results—Twenty-two percent of men suffered from psychological distress, indicated by a score of �5 on the GHQ. There_**
were 130 incident strokes recorded, of which 17 were fatal and 113 nonfatal. The relative risk of incident ischemic stroke
was 1.45 (95% CI, 0.98 to 2.14) for those who showed symptoms of psychological distress compared with those who
did not. For fatal stroke the relative risk was 3.36 (95% CI, 1.29 to 8.71) and for nonfatal stroke 1.25 (95% CI, 0.82
to 1.92). The relative risk of TIA for the distressed group was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.26 to 1.53). The results were unchanged
after adjustment for body mass index, systolic blood pressure, smoking, heavy drinking, social class, and marital status.
However, additionally controlling for previously diagnosed ischemic heart disease, diabetes, respiratory disease, and
retirement due to ill health attenuated the relative risks, but not markedly. For fatal strokes the relative risk decreased
to 2.56 (95% CI, 0.97 to 6.75) when all confounding variables were included in the model. There was a graded
association between degree of psychological distress and risk of fatal ischemic stroke.
**_Conclusions—Psychological distress is a predictor of fatal ischemic stroke but not of nonfatal ischemic stroke or TIA._**
Further work examining the mechanisms of this association is required. (Stroke. 2002;33:7-12.)

affected by the degree of mood disorder.[1] Of more recent
interest is the issue of whether mood disorder can lead to
stroke. While several recent epidemiological studies have
reported positive associations between symptoms of psychological distress and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk,[2–6]

fewer studies have examined the association with stroke, and
the results of these were inconsistent or the studies had
methodological limitations.
A prospective US study in an elderly population found no
association between depressive symptoms and stroke mortality after adjustment for known risk factors.[7] However, in the
Alameda County study, stroke mortality was increased in


individuals with depressive symptoms after controlling for
possible confounders,[8] although data were not available to
examine incident stroke. Findings using data from 3 study
sites in the United States showed that the risk of stroke in
elderly hypertensive men and women who reported high
levels of depressive symptoms was more than twice that of
nondepressed hypertensives.[9] In another study among elderly
individuals, depressive symptoms measured at baseline were
not prognostic, although subsequent increases in depression
were predictive of stroke risk.[10] In neither of these 2 studies
could the possibility of reverse causality—depressive symptoms occurring because of stroke—be discounted. Increased
risk of fatal and nonfatal stroke was found in both black and
white individuals reporting depressive symptoms studied in

the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) I Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study, which persisted after adjustment for important stroke risk factors and
which was also seen after exclusion of those with prevalent
diabetes and CHD and those who died within 3 years of
baseline measurements.[11] A positive relationship between
depressive symptoms and incident ischemic stroke has been
found in a small Japanese study[12] and in a larger Australian
cohort study.[13]
Depression is a common illness and is responsible for
much morbidity in its own right, and depressive symptoms
are associated with increased mortality.[14] In this study we
investigate whether psychological distress measured at baseline in healthy middle-aged men is associated with increased
risk of incident fatal and nonfatal first ischemic stroke and
also with transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurring over the
following 14 years.

##### Subjects and Methods
**Design**
The Caerphilly Study is a community-based, prospective study of
cardiovascular disease and related outcomes in men aged 45 to 59
years who were recruited during 1979–1983 from the town of
Caerphilly, South Wales, and the adjacent villages. All men in the
eligible age group were identified from the electoral register (2818)
and invited to participate, with an 89% recruitment rate. During
1984–1988, 2398 men aged 49 to 64 years participated in phase II of
the study, thus including all the original cohort recruited in phase I
and men who had moved into the area during the interim. Full details
of the Caerphilly Study are available elsewhere.[15,16]

**Measurement of Exposures**
The phase II follow-up collected the following measurements:
medical history, smoking history, London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine chest pain questionnaire, psychosocial questionnaires, height, weight, blood pressure measured with a random-zero
sphygmomanometer, and a 12-lead ECG. Detailed methods for these
and the wide range of other measures that were performed are
described elsewhere.[15,17]
Psychological distress was measured by the 30-item General
Health Questionnaire (GHQ).[18] The use of this questionnaire was
validated with the use of a subsample of 97 men using the Clinical
Interview Schedule (CIS).[19] Briefly, a psychiatrist (S.S.) trained in
the use of the CIS conducted interviews at home with a subsample of
97 participants consecutively presenting for examination and stratified by GHQ score. The psychiatrist was blinded to the GHQ score.
Sensitivity and specificity of a GHQ threshold of 4 of 5 were both
71%, with the CIS total weight score used as the reference. As a
result of receiver-operating characteristic analysis, respondents scoring 0 to 4 on the GHQ were considered non-cases, and those scoring
�5 were considered possible cases of minor psychiatric disorder.
GHQ data were available on 2201 men. The analyses were repeated
with the use of tertile groups of GHQ score rather than the
dichotomized variable with the threshold of 5.

**Measurement of Outcome**
The men were followed up for 14 years, during which ischemic
stroke events were ascertained. Deaths from stroke comprised all
those classified as International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
_Revision codes 430 to 438. Nonfatal strokes were defined clinically_
according to World Health Organization criteria as all those cerebrovascular events that produced a focal or global neurological
deficit of acute onset that was present for �24 hours. Stroke type
was then classified by scrutiny of all medical records, including
neuroradiology, and when records were poor, the participant or a


symptoms, signs, past medical history, and clinical course were
reviewed independently by 2 clinicians (a stroke specialist and a
clinical epidemiologist), and in cases of diagnostic disagreement a
third stroke epidemiologist arbitrated. Definite strokes were classified as those that met World Health Organization criteria, and these
were further subdivided on the basis of neuroradiology or autopsy
findings into infarction or hemorrhage. Probable ischemic strokes
were those that met World Health Organization criteria but in which
confirmatory neuroradiology or autopsy information was not available or noncontributory and without symptoms or signs suggestive of
hemorrhage. Possible ischemic strokes were those in which clinical
findings were limited and confirmatory information was lacking but
in which it was most likely that the underlying pathology was
ischemic. No attempt was made to distinguish lacunar or other
subtypes of stroke from other ischemic strokes. Definite hemorrhagic
strokes were excluded from the analyses, but all other cases were
included. Those men who had symptoms or signs suggestive of a
stroke or amaurosis fugax but who recovered within 24 hours were
classified as suffering a TIA, together with those reporting a
diagnosis of TIA. Detailed methods for ascertainment of strokes in
the Caerphilly cohort are described elsewhere.[16]

**Statistical Methods**
Cox regression was used to obtain the hazard ratios of all ischemic
strokes, fatal and nonfatal, adjusted for age and other covariates. The
hazard ratios of stroke in those with mood disorder compared with
those without were calculated (1) with adjustment for age alone; (2)
with adjustment for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure,
smoking, heavy drinking, social class, and marital status; (3) with
adjustment for age and prevalent chronic disease; and (4) with
adjustment for all of these variables. Age, body mass index, and
systolic blood pressure were fitted as continuous variables. Smoking
was dichotomized into current smokers and non-smokers. Alcohol
consumption was fitted as a dichotomized variable, with heavy
drinking defined as �21 units per week. Social class was dichotomized into nonmanual and manual occupations. Marital status was
either currently married or not married. A chronic disease variable
was created that indicated whether the men suffered from 1 or more
of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, or respiratory disease or had
retired on grounds of ill health. Men were deemed to have ischemic
heart disease at baseline if they had self-reported angina, ECGdiagnosed myocardial infarction, or a history of myocardial infarction. Diabetes was self-reported. Chronic obstructive airways disease
or asthma was inferred from use of a bronchodilator drug in the
previous week.

##### Results
A total of 2201 men completed the GHQ, of whom 22%
scored in the mood disorder range of �4 of 30. The median
score was 1, and the interquartile range was 0 to 4, with a
mean score of 3.1. There were 29 men who had had strokes
before phase II, and these were excluded from the main
analyses. An additional 48 men did not have a full set of
measurements on all the risk factors used for adjustments and
were also excluded. In the remaining cohort of 2124 men, 130
incident strokes were recorded, of which 17 were fatal and
113 nonfatal. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the men
stratified by whether or not they suffered a stroke in the
follow-up period. Men who had a stroke were slightly older
and heavier, had higher systolic blood pressure, and were
more likely to have a manual occupation and to be current
smokers than those who did not suffer a stroke. They also
tended to report more symptoms of anxiety and depression on
the GHQ. Table 2 shows the relationship between presence or
absence of psychological distress and a range of stroke risk

The rate of ischemic stroke was 7.25/1000 per year for
those men with psychological distress, ie, a GHQ score of �5
of 30, compared with 5.15/1000 per year for those with a
GHQ score of �5. The hazard ratio for all ischemic stroke
was 1.45 (95% CI, 0.98 to 2.14) in a comparison of those men
with psychological distress with the remainder. However, this
ratio masks a marked difference in the relative risk of fatal


stroke of 3.36 (95% CI, 1.29 to 8.71) compared with that of
nonfatal stroke of 1.25 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.92), as shown in

There was no increase in hazard ratio for TIA in those men
with psychological distress compared with the remainder
(0.63; 95% CI, 0.26 to 1.53), although an additional 47 men

from a TIA before phase II.

factors for stroke. Adjustment for body mass index, systolic
blood pressure, smoking, heavy drinking, social class, and
marital status did not have much effect on hazard ratios for all
categories of ischemic stroke. Inclusion of these variables
decreased the relative risk from 1.45 to 1.41 for all strokes,
from 3.36 to 3.27 for fatal strokes, and from 1.25 to 1.22 for
nonfatal strokes. However, attenuation in hazard ratios was
found when adjustment was made for chronic disease (ie, 1 or
more of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive
airways disease, or retirement due to ill health); the hazard
ratios decreased from 1.45 to 1.28 for all strokes, from 3.36
to 2.63 for fatal strokes, and from 1.25 to 1.12 for nonfatal
strokes. The final model, including all the variables, showed
results similar to the model that only included chronic
disease. The hazard ratio for fatal stroke after all adjustments
was 2.56 (95% CI, 0.97 to 6.75).
When psychological distress symptoms were grouped by
tertile of GHQ score, there was little evidence of any
association with all and nonfatal ischemic strokes. However a
graded and highly statistically significant response effect
(trend P�0.0005) was observed for fatal ischemic strokes,


and this effect persisted after controlling for confounding
variables. For fatal strokes the hazard ratio for the middle
tertile of GHQ was 2.94 (95% CI, 0.49 to 17.59), decreasing
to 2.70 (95% CI, 0.45 to 16.31) after controlling for all
confounding variables. The hazard ratio for the top tertile of
GHQ was 8.06 (95% CI, 1.79 to 36.39), which decreased to
6.15 (95% CI, 1.37 to 29.46) after all adjustments.

##### Discussion
In this study of a representative sample of middle-aged men,
those with symptoms of psychological distress were over 3
times more likely to die of ischemic stroke than their
nonsymptomatic counterparts after controlling for common
stroke risk factors. This did not appear to be due to an effect
of using a threshold to classify psychological distress since a
graded response was also observed when the distribution of
GHQ scores was analyzed in tertile groups. There was no
evidence of an association between GHQ and nonfatal strokes
and TIAs. Previous studies have reported positive associations between depressive symptoms and stroke mortality, but,
to our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the

association of psychological distress with both fatal and
nonfatal strokes and with TIA.

**Strengths and Limitations**
The Caerphilly Study is a large, population-based, long-term
cohort that has achieved excellent participant compliance
since its inception. Because of the methods used to collect
stroke data, it is likely that there was near-complete ascertainment of incident strokes.[17] Data were collected on both
fatal and nonfatal events, and strokes were classified into
ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes.[20] The GHQ was measured before onset of stroke and was also validated in this
population. A wide range of risk factors, including prevalent
cardiovascular disease, was controlled for in the analyses.
Limitations of the study included the fact that only male
participants were recruited into the initial study, precluding
examination of these relationships in women. Any bias
introduced by loss to follow-up or lack of data on baseline
risk factors is likely to be small because both of these were
minimal. There may have been some misclassification of
stroke type, but this too is likely to be small,[20] and any effect
on our findings has been negligible. Use of self-reported
chronic disease status may also have led to potential bias,
although large population-based studies have indicated that
self-reports of diabetes and ischemic heart disease are likely
to be accurate.[21,22] We only used the GHQ at baseline, and
reassessment would have provided a more powerful means of
examining the relationship between persistent psychological
distress and stroke. Although the use of a standardized
clinical interview would have provided a more powerful
means of examining the relationship between clinically relevant psychological distress and stroke, in common with most
epidemiological studies, the use of a standardized interview
schedule was beyond our resources for a study of 2200 men.
However, a validation exercise was undertaken, as described
previously.[19]
The explanation for the association between psychological
distress and stroke is likely to be complex. It may be
associated causally (on the etiologic pathway) with the
adoption of unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, unhealthy
diet, or lack of exercise, which in themselves increase the risk
of stroke. There is evidence that depression increases the
likelihood of smoking and reduces physical activity, both risk
factors for stroke.[23–25] We adjusted for smoking and alcohol
consumption, both risk factors for stroke, but it is possible
that misclassification of these exposures has resulted in a
degree of residual confounding. Psychological distress, although not directly linked to stroke, may be related to
physiological risk factors for stroke such as hypertension,
elevated cholesterol, or glucose intolerance. In our study
there was no evidence that this was the case, and adjustment
for physiological factors did not attenuate the associations
observed. Furthermore, if biological factors were important
mediators, a relationship with both fatal and nonfatal stroke
would be expected.
Psychological distress may be a mediating factor between
exposure to adverse social circumstances and stroke. These
adverse circumstances might include social isolation and


and at home. Lower socioeconomic status may, in turn, be an
antecedent of these adverse social circumstances. However,
adjustment for both marital status and social class did not
have much effect on the hazard ratios observed. Psychological distress may be a consequence of personality characteristics, such as hostility, that also relate independently to
higher stroke risk through chronic physiological hyperreactivity in stressful occupational and domestic contexts. Further
analyses of personality characteristics and stroke are planned.
There is evidence in this cohort that men are more likely to
suffer psychological distress if they have chronic ill health.
For example, 34% of the men who had pre–phase II strokes,
28% of the men with prevalent ischemic heart disease, 25%
of diabetics, 24% of men with chronic obstructive airways
disease, and 40% of men who had retired because of ill health
scored �5 on the GHQ compared with 22% of cases in the
cohort overall. It would seem to be a reasonable assumption
that men who perceived that their health had deteriorated or
had long-term poor health would be more likely to suffer
from psychological distress. Since ischemic heart disease[26]
and low forced expiratory volume in 1 second,[27] which is
associated with chronic airways disease, are both powerful
risk factors for stroke, it is possible that the association
between GHQ score and stroke is confounded by chronic
disease status. Depression is now increasingly recognized as
a risk factor for CHD,[4,5,28] and it is possible that the
associations observed in our study reflect a prior increased
risk of CHD in depressed men, who then go on to develop
stroke as a consequence of CHD. However, it is not possible
to determine whether the depressive symptoms reported at
phase II occurred before or after chronic disease. Furthermore, although controlling for prevalent chronic disease
attenuated the hazard ratios observed, they remained large
and are consistent with findings from other studies that have
also controlled for coexistent disease.[8,11] Because of the small
numbers of deaths from ischemic stroke, further analyses
excluding those men who died or suffered a cardiovascular
event in the 2 years after administration of the GHQ were not
performed. However, studies that have done this have reported little attenuation in the magnitude of risk observed.[8,11]
In our study the association of psychological distress with
all ischemic stroke is not as strong as that reported in
NHANES, although it is broadly consistent with those findings.[11] However, NHANES did not report analyses of nonfatal and fatal stroke separately, nor was stroke subtype
defined. Our findings support the hypothesis that psychological distress is a risk marker for fatal but not nonfatal ischemic
stroke, suggesting that distress has its effects on survival
rather than acting as a primarily etiologic factor. It is possible
that men with psychological distress suffered more severe
strokes and therefore were more likely to die from the stroke.
Alternatively, they may have suffered the same degree of
damage at the stroke event, but their case fatality was worse,
either through direct effects of psychological distress, associated risk factors for case fatality, or poorer access to
medical care. Although the role of medication was not
examined in this study, there is evidence that men who are on
antidepressant medication may be at increased risk of cardio

more likely to ignore health promotion advice and to have
poor compliance with any prescribed medical regimen for
hypertension or diabetes or after a myocardial infarction.[30]
Small basal ganglia lesions have been shown to be significantly associated with depressive symptoms.[31] It is possible
that the men suffering mild asymptomatic cerebral infarcts
would become depressed as a result of the infarct. However,
our analysis of TIAs, which tend to be recurrent, found no
association between psychological distress and TIA, which
suggests that this is an unlikely explanation for the association. Other mechanisms have been proposed, but we are
unable to examine those in the present study. Psychological
distress may lead to an elevated risk of stroke through
increased adrenergic activity,[5] production of specific neuroendocrine and immunologic effects,[32,33] platelet activation
or alteration,[29] or lipid metabolism,[10] but none of these
hypotheses would explain a relationship only with fatal
stroke. Further work should attempt to characterize the
underlying psychiatric states more accurately so that relationships between ischemic stroke and minor and major depressive illness can be examined.

**Conclusions**
The positive association between psychological distress and
fatal ischemic stroke is not readily explained. Psychological
distress is debilitating, and the finding that it may also
increase risk of fatal stroke, one of the leading causes of
mortality, indicates the need to better understand the mechanisms of this effect and also to improve primary prevention
interventions for psychological distress in later life. Since
there appears to be a graded association, those individuals
who suffer minor distress are also likely to benefit from
successful interventions.
