**OBJECTIVES: To examine the influence of distinct clus-**
ters of psychiatric symptoms on subsequent cause-specific
mortality in older persons living in the community.
**DESIGN: A prospective cohort study over 7.5 years.**
**SETTING: Otsuki-town, Kochi prefecture, Japan.**
**PARTICIPANTS: Nine hundred eighty community-dwell-**
ing persons, aged 65 to 84 in 1991.
**MEASUREMENTS: Psychiatric symptoms at baseline were**
measured using the 30-item version of the General Health
Questionnaire (GHQ-30). A factor analysis was performed
on the responses of all 980 subjects. The relationships between subscale scores on the identified factors and causes
of deaths occurring over 7.5 years in 817 respondents with
no physical disability at baseline were assessed using a proportional hazards model adjusted for age, gender, chronic
conditions under treatment, regular physical activity, and
availability of close or casual neighbors.
**RESULTS: The factor analysis identified three clusters of**
psychiatric symptoms: depression, apathy/anergia, and anxiety. In the proportional hazards model, which included
three GHQ subscales depicting these factors simultaneously,
the depression subscale was associated with increased mortality from cerebrovascular disease (multivariate adjusted
hazard ratio per unit increase in the standard score on the
depression subscale � 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI)
� 1.17–3.55), and the apathy/anergia subscale was associated with increased mortality from noncancer and noncardiovascular causes (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio per
unit increase in the standard score on the apathy/anergia
subscale � 1.71, 95% CI � 1.25–2.34). The anxiety subscale was not associated with any cause of death.

in older persons living in communities. Depression, especially, has been investigated in relation to overall mortality[1–9]
and to mortality from and incidence of heart disease,[5,7,10–12]
cerebrovascular disease,[5,10,11,13] and malignant neoplasms[7,14,15]
and the onset of physical disability.[6,16,17] With a few exceptions,[1,2,4,13,14] a depressive symptom cluster, even when not
meeting the criteria for a clinical depressive disorder,[6] is
associated with adverse health consequences after adjustment for physical health status.[3,6,9,10,15–17] Some studies
have reported that associations vary by gender,[5,11,12] physical health status,[8] duration of depressive symptoms,[10,11,15]
and cause of death.[7]
Information on the adverse effects of other types of psychopathology on health consequences for community-dwelling
older persons is sparse.[3,18] Further studies should evaluate
both the independent effects of different psychopathologies
and their comorbidity with depression. Instruments measuring depression and other types of psychopathology are
suited to the conduct of such studies.
The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) is a 60-item
instrument that measures four categories of psychological
distress and behavior alteration: depression, anxiety, social
impairment, and hypochondriasis (somatic symptoms). Two
abbreviated versions of the GHQ, a 28-item version (the
GHQ-28) and a 30-item version (the GHQ-30), have widely
been used as instruments to screen for current and diagnosable psychiatric disorders in community settings.[19,20]


-----

The GHQ-28 covers all four psychiatric symptom clusters
assessed by the GHQ and has commonly been used to create four subscales corresponding to the respective elements. However, difficulties in interpreting the somatic
symptom clusters have been recognized, in that the same
somatic symptoms can be present in a person with an entirely physical illness as in one with a psychopathology.
Depressed persons may overemphasize somatic symptoms
simply because of their excessive insight into depressive
state.[21] The correct attribution of somatic symptoms to a
physical illness as opposed to a depressive mood is difficult. Interpretation of the second abbreviated version of
the GHQ, the GHQ-30, is not plagued by this problem because items relevant to somatic symptoms are excluded.
Subscales reflecting purely psychiatric symptoms can be
created from responses to the GHQ-30.
The objective of the present study was to examine the
relationships of distinct psychiatric symptom clusters with
subsequent causes of death in older persons living in the
community. Distinct psychiatric symptom clusters for community-dwelling older persons in Japan were identified, using the GHQ-30, and subscales depicting individual clusters
were created. Their associations with specific causes of
subsequent mortality were investigated in a 7.5-year prospective study.

**METHODS**

**Study Sample**

The present study was conducted in Otsuki-town, Kochi
prefecture, which is located on the southwest coast of
Shikoku Island, Japan. In this community of about 8,000
residents, 23% of persons were aged 65 and older in 1990.
A questionnaire survey on health status and lifestyle characteristics of all noninstitutionalized residents aged 65 to 84
was conducted in February 1991. Of 1,494 residents meeting these requirements, 1,377 (92%) responded to the questionnaire survey. Reasons for nonresponse included absence
during the survey period (n � 36) and refusal (n � 81). Of
these 1,377 respondents, 980 completed the GHQ-30.

**Study Variables**
The Japanese version of the GHQ-30[22] formed the baseline survey. The respondents evaluated their experience of
each of 30 psychiatric symptoms over the past few weeks
on a 4-point scale: “0, not at all; 1, no more than usual; 2,
rather more than usual; and 3, much more than usual.”
Each symptom was scored according to the Likert scoring
method for the response categories (0-1-2-3) to maximize
the variability of the responses.
Physical health status at baseline was assessed in terms
of activities of daily living (ADL) impairment and selfreported chronic conditions under treatment. ADL impairment was evaluated according to whether help was needed
on six items derived from the Older Americans Resources
and Services methodology:[23] walking, bathing, going to
the toilet, dressing, grooming, and eating. Persons who
needed help for at least one ADL item were regarded as
impaired Self-report of chronic conditions under treat

included hypertension, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus.
The lifestyle characteristics surveyed at baseline comprised three health-related practices: smoking (present,
past, and never), frequency of drinking (almost every day,
sometimes, and never), and regular physical activity (performing spare-time physical activities regularly, taking the
opportunity for increasing physical activity in the day time,
and spending the daytime in a sedentary way) and three elements of social networks: marital status (married and not
married), availability of close friends (having one or more
close friends and having none), and availability of close or
casual neighbors (having neighbors with whom one talks
about personal matters, having casual neighbors to whom
one says hello, and having neither type of neighbor).

**Follow-Up Status**
Of the 980 persons who completed the GHQ-30, 817
were followed in the present analysis. Persons with ADL
impairment (n � 113) and with missing values on the covariates used in the multivariate analysis (n � 50) were excluded.
The follow-up status of respondents was determined
by inspecting the municipal records of movement and
deaths filed under the family registration act of Japan. Under the act, all residents are required to notify the municipality of moves and vital events. A death certificate accompanies notifications of death. During the follow-up period
of 7.5 years, from February 1991 to the end of August
1998, 23 subjects moved from the area and 138 died. The
underlying cause of death as given on the death certificate
was coded according to the International Classification of
_Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). After excluding two_
deaths from unknown causes, the numbers of deaths from
specific causes were as follows: 20 deaths from cerebrovascular disease (ICD-9 codes 430–438); 26 deaths
from heart disease (ICD-9 codes 390–392, 393–398, 401–
405, 410–414, 415–429, 440–459); and 46 deaths from
malignant neoplasms (ICD-9 codes 140–208). Of the remaining 44 deaths, 10 were from pneumonia and influenza (ICD-9 codes 480–486, 487), nine from accidents
and injuries (ICD-9 codes 800–999), and 25 from all other
causes. These 44 deaths were combined as noncardiovascular and noncancer causes.

**Statistical Analysis**
A factor analysis with a varimax rotation was performed
on the responses of the 980 persons who completed the
GHQ-30. Initial factors were extracted using the principal
components analysis, and a varimax rotation was performed on the initial factor solution. The resulting factor
structure was interpreted, making reference to previous
studies on factor structure of the GHQ-30 in community
settings.[24–30] In accordance with previously employed criteria,[28] an item was defined as loading on a given factor if
the factor loading was 0.5 or greater for that factor and
less than 0.5 for other factors. A subscale for each GHQ
factor was created by summing subject responses to the
items that had loadings of 0.5 or greater on the corresponding factor. The score on each subscale was transformed as a standard score with mean and standard devia

-----

To test for differences between the categories of the dichotomized study variables in the age- and gender-adjusted
mean scores on the individual GHQ subscales, an analysis
of covariance was performed.
A proportional hazards model was used to assess the
association of each GHQ subscale with subsequent mortality for the 817 persons who had had no ADL impairment. The proportional hazards assumption for each GHQ
subscale was checked using a model that included an interaction term between time and the score on the subscale.
No GHQ subscale violated the assumptions in predicting
all-cause or cause-specific mortality.
Analyses using a continuous measure of psychopathology may fail to ascertain an association between the
psychopathology and subsequent mortality if the relationship is nonlinear.[31] Therefore, standard scores for individual GHQ subscales were tested in continuous and dichotomous versions (�1 vs �1). Two models were fitted for
each approach; one tested each of the three GHQ subscales separately and the other the three GHQ subscales simultaneously. In the latter case, the association of each
GHQ factor with mortality was examined after adjustment for comorbidity of the other GHQ factors. In the
analyses of cause-specific mortality, separate models were
fitted for each cause of death, and persons who had died
from other causes were treated as censored at the time of
dying. In all models, the covariates of age, gender, chronic
conditions under treatment, and lifestyle characteristics
were adjusted for. The statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS 10.0J for Windows.

**RESULTS**
The mean age � standard deviation at baseline of the subjects used in the factor analysis (n � 980) was 72.0 � 5.4.
Sixty-one percent were women, and 89% had no impairment on the six ADL items at that time.
As shown in Table 1, factor analysis with a varimax
rotation identified five factors with eigenvalues exceeding
unity. The five factors accounted for 53.9% of the total
variance, whereas the first three factors accounted for
40.5%. Six items (items 19, 23, 24, 25, 29, 30) of the
seven that loaded only on the first factor were interpreted
as depression. All seven items (items 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) that
loaded on the second factor were related to apathy and anergia (lack of energy). Two items relating to sleep disturbance (items 2, 5) and four items relating to anxiety (items
14, 15, 18, 21) defined the third factor. The combinations
of items with loadings of 0.5 or greater on these three factors were similar to findings in other populations[24–30] and
were labeled depression, apathy/anergia, and anxiety, respectively, for the purposes of this study. The fourth and
the fifth factors were not interpreted, because the percentage of variance that each accounted for was relatively
small (�8%), and only two or three items in each had
loadings of 0.5 or greater.
Table 2 presents descriptive and internal consistency
statistics for the subscales corresponding to the three factors described. Item 22, which had loadings of 0.5 or
greater on both the depression and the anxiety factor, was
excluded when creating those two subscales. All reliability
estimates (Cronbach’s coefficient alpha) for the three sub

Table 3 describes differences at baseline in the GHQ
subscale scores between categories of age, gender, physical
health status, and lifestyle characteristics. Scores on the
depression and apathy/anergia subscales were higher in
the older age group, and those on the depression and the
anxiety subscales were higher in women. For five of the six
cells resulting from the three GHQ subscales and two
physical health variables, age- and gender-adjusted mean
scores on the GHQ subscales were higher for persons with
physical health impairment. The exception of no difference occurred for depression scores in relation to number
of chronic conditions. For lifestyle characteristics, ageand gender-adjusted mean scores on the GHQ subscales
were higher in persons not performing regular physical activity and in those having no close or casual neighbors.
The two lifestyle characteristics were treated as potentially
confounding variables in the survival analysis.
Table 4 shows the relationships between the individual
GHQ subscales and subsequent all-cause and cause-specific
mortality. Although the hazard ratios associated with the
dichotomized subscales are higher than those associated
with the continuous subscales, the two approaches give the
same pattern of results. Therefore, only the results of the
analysis using continuous subscales are described below.
When the individual GHQ subscales were examined
separately, depression and apathy/anergia were found to
be predictive of subsequent all-cause mortality, but, when
all three GHQ subscales were included simultaneously,
neither of these factors was associated with all-cause mortality. In the investigation of cause-specific mortality, in
which the three GHQ subscales were included simultaneously, depression was found to be associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease mortality (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio per unit increase in the
depression subscale � 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) �
1.17–3.55), and apathy/anergia was found to be associated with an excess risk of dying from noncardiovascular
and noncancer causes (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio
per unit increase in the apathy/anergia subscale � 1.71,
95% CI � 1.25–2.34). No significant association was
found between anxiety and mortality in the model that included all three GHQ subscales simultaneously.
The interactions of each of the GHQ subscales with
age and gender were examined with respect to all-cause
and cause-specific mortality. The only statistically significant interaction that occurred was between depression and
gender, with regard to heart disease mortality (P � .005). To
investigate this interaction further, gender-specific models
using the depression subscale only were fitted for prediction of heart disease mortality. As seen in Table 5, depression was significantly associated with the risk of dying
from heart disease in women only (multivariate adjusted
hazard ratio per unit increase in the depression subscale in
women � 2.03, 95% CI � 1.17–3.50).

**DISCUSSION**
The burden of GHQ-derived psychiatric symptom clusters
was found to be associated with subsequent mortality
among community-dwelling older persons. These associations were observed in persons with no physical disability

The reasons for excluding persons with ADL impairment should be clarified. Antecedent psychopathology is
an independent predictor of physical disability,[16,17] and
thus physical disability may represent an intermediate step
in the causal pathway between a psychiatric symptom
cluster and mortality in older populations. Therefore, control of physical disability as a confounding factor reduces
the variability of the psychiatric symptom cluster[7,12] and
underestimates the association of interest. By choosing
subjects with no ADL impairment, the problem of overad

justment for physical disability can be avoided. In the
present analysis, the number of chronic conditions under
treatment was treated as a variable of physical health status that might confound the association of interest.
This study has several limitations. First, the findings
could be biased because only persons who could complete
the GHQ-30 were admitted as subjects. Of the 397 persons who were excluded from the present analysis because
of incomplete responses to the GHQ-30, 302 had no ADL
impairment. Compared with persons who were used in the

73.1 vs 71.8; two-sample _t test, equality of variances as-_
sumed, P � .002). There was no difference in the proportions of women and, of those with chronic conditions under treatment, between the two groups. If the persons
excluded from the analysis had higher levels of psychiatric
symptoms, associated with older age, then the present
findings would underestimate the effect of the burden of
psychiatric symptom clusters on subsequent mortality.[11]

Second, the GHQ might fail to identify some persons
with chronic psychiatric symptoms in the target population. Because the response categories of the GHQ required
assessment of whether each symptom was “worse than
usual,” this instrument might not identify the symptom in


come to consider it usual.[20,32] The associations observed in
the present study might, therefore, reflect only the effects
of acute psychiatric symptoms.
Third, the loss of significant associations between the
individual GHQ subscale scores and all-cause mortality,
when all three GHQ subscales were included simultaneously, might indicate that the depression and the apathy/anergia subscales were not truly independent of each
other but shared a variance that was the real correlate of
all-cause mortality, this latent variance being imperfectly
captured by either of the subscales. Alternatively, an independent influence of the GHQ subscales on specific causes
of death might be diluted in the analysis for all-cause mortality, where relationships with insignificant causes of death

Fourth, the subscales of the GHQ-30 have not been validated against a clinical diagnosis. The persons with higher
scores on the subscales might include those who do not fit
clinical criteria for psychiatric disorders. Depressive symptoms not meeting the criteria for clinical depressive disorders
have been found to explain the discrepancy between a high
prevalence of depressive symptoms and a low prevalence of
clinically diagnosable depressive disorders in community
populations.[33] Such symptoms have been identified as independent predictors of adverse health consequences.[6,34,35] A


similar situation may exist for other clusters of psychiatric
symptoms not meeting the criteria for clinical disorders but
relevant to subsequent health events and should be explored.
Finally, the presence of persons with occult or unreported physical illnesses at baseline might have a residual
confounding effect on the association of psychiatric symptoms with mortality. However, in the present study, the residual confounding effect seemed to be small. An analysis
excluding the 10 persons who had died within 1 year of
the baseline survey did not alter the findings.

The specific relationships between distinct psychiatric
symptom clusters and subsequent causes of death are worthy of notice. In the present study, depressive symptoms at
baseline were associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease mortality after adjustment for gender.
This finding is consistent with the association between
higher levels of depressive symptoms and increased risk of
mortality from stroke in a 29-year prospective study of
community-dwelling adults (mean age at baseline, 43
years) in Alameda County, the United States.[36] However,
findings of prospective studies have been inconsistent for
older populations with regard to the association between
depression and cerebrovascular disease. The Established
Population for the Epidemiologic Study for the Elderly
(EPESE) in the United States, at its New Haven site, using
all participants, found no relationship between initial scores
on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D) and stroke incidence across 7 years, after adjustment for gender and other potential confounding factors.[13]
However, the depression score was associated with an increased incidence of stroke over 6 years, in both genders,
when subjects were restricted to those with diagnosed hypertension.[5] At two other sites of the EPESE, the association between scores on the CES-D and stroke incidence
was examined, by gender, in those with diagnosed hypertension, and a significant association was observed among
men in East Boston but not in Iowa.[5]
As in the present study, subsequent increased risk of
cardiovascular disease has been found to be associated
with initial depressive symptom clusters in women only.
At the New Haven site of the EPESE, a 9-year prospective
study using all participants found an association between
scores on the CES-D and coronary heart disease mortality
in women with no physical disability.[12] In a 6-year prospective study, at three sites of the EPESE, which restricted
subjects to those with diagnosed hypertension, an association was found for women at two of the three sites (New
Haven and Iowa).[5]
By contrast, no epidemiological study has examined
the relationship, found here, between a symptom cluster
indicating apathy/anergia and the risk of dying from noncancer and noncardiovascular causes.
Depressive symptoms and apathy/anergia do not necessarily imply an affective disorder, and other explanations
for the observed association between psychiatric symptom
clusters and mortality need to be explored. For example,
mood disturbance, fatigue, cognitive slowing, and anergia
are associated with certain cytokines, notably �-interferon.[37,38] The neuropsychiatric changes associated with �interferon are thought to reflect a disturbance in frontal
lobe function[39,40] and may be mediated by neuroendocrine,
neurotransmitter, or cytokine effects.[38,41] The neuroendocrine effects of �-interferon include disorders of thyroid
function and stimulation of the adrenocorticotropic hormone/cortisol axis. The neurotransmitter effects of �-interferon include opioid-dopamine changes (underactivity of endogenous opioid systems, acting as a dopamine antagonist),
serotonin depletion, and norepinephrine increases. Serotonin depletion is strongly associated with depressive symptoms. The cytokine effects of �-interferon include the secondary production of proinflammatory cytokines such as


effects. It may affect the metabolism of lipoproteins and
cause hypocholesterolemia,[42] which is thought to be associated with deaths due to noncardiovascular and noncancer
causes.[43]
In their aggregate, the pathways evoked by �-interferon
could be capable of contributing directly and indirectly to the
development of, and the excess disability associated with,
cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease.[44] Thus, the
“depressive” symptoms and apathy/anergia observed here
could be either the direct result of underlying neuroendocrine
or neuroimmunological responses to concurrent medical illnesses or a symptom of processes that affect the course of
some illnesses. Neuroendocrine and neuroimmunological
changes associated with medical illnesses should also be investigated in further studies on the relationship between psychiatric symptoms and subsequent health events.
The present study indicates that two of the three distinct psychiatric symptom clusters identified by the GHQ30 have differential influences on subsequent causes of
death in community-dwelling older persons. Persons with
depressive symptoms and those with symptoms indicating
apathy/anergia are at increased risk of death from differing causes. In Japan, public health services aimed at primary and secondary prevention of chronic diseases are
provided at the municipality level for community-dwelling
older persons, but psychiatric symptoms as influences on
subsequent health events have not been well recognized in
the preventive health services. Addressing the burden of
psychiatric symptom clusters, even when they do not meet
the criteria of clinically diagnosable disorders, could contribute to the prevention of mortality from specific causes.
