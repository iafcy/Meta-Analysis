Background The relationship between depression and cerebrovascular disease
(CBVD) continues to be debated although little research has compared the predictive power of depression for coronary heart disease
(CHD) with that for CBVD within the same population. This study
aimed to compare the importance of depression for CHD and CBVD
within the same population of adults free of apparent cardiovascular disease.

Methods A random sample of 23 282 adults (9507 men, 13 775 women) aged
20–54 years were followed up for 7 years. Fatal and first non-fatal
CHD and CBVD events were documented by linkage to the
National-hospital-discharge and mortality registers.

Results Sex–age–education-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for CHD was 1.66

[95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24–2.24] for participants with
mild to severe depressive symptoms, i.e. those scoring 510 on the
21-item Beck Depression Inventory, and 2.04 (1.27–3.27) for those
who filled antidepressant prescriptions compared with those without depression markers in 1998, i.e. at study baseline. For CBVD,
the corresponding HRs were 1.01 (0.67–1.53) and 1.77 (0.95–3.29).
After adjustment for behavioural and biological risk factors these
associations were reduced but remained evident for CHD, the
adjusted HRs being 1.47 (1.08–1.99) and 1.72 (1.06–2.77). For
CBVD, the corresponding multivariable adjusted HRs were 0.87
(0.57–1.32) and 1.52 (0.81–2.84).

Conclusions Self-reported depression using a standardized questionnaire and
clinical markers of mild to severe depression were associated with
an increased risk for CHD. There was no clear evidence that depression is a risk factor for CBVD, but this needs further confirmation.

## Introduction
Cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease (CBVD), is
the leading cause of death, major morbidity and disability in the world.[1] Approximately 17.5 million
people died from cardiovascular diseases in 2005, representing 30% of all deaths globally.
Research has identified cigarette smoking, high alcohol intake, high cholesterol levels, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity
as important risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[2]

Findings from prospective studies using rigorous
methods show that depression may also be a risk
factor in the pathophysiological progression of cardiovascular disease.[3] Several recent studies provide compelling evidece showing depression to influence the
onset and outcome of CHD, indicating that it may
act as a distal risk factor and play a role in disease
prognosis.[4] Successive meta-analyses show depression
to increase the risk for onset of CHD, with pooled
relative risks between 1.6 and 1.8.[5–7]

Although there appears to be a consensus on the
depression–CHD link, more controversies remain
regarding the association between depression and
CBVD. In fact, fewer studies have examined the association between depression and the risk for the onset
of CBVD, and the findings are inconsistent. Results
from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area
Study[8] showed that individuals with a history of
depressive symptoms had greater risk of fatal or
self-reported stroke. In a small-scale study from
Japan,[9] depressive symptoms were associated with
an increased incidence of stroke. Similar results
have been obtained from Australian,[10] Dutch[11,12]

and Swedish[1] studies on the elderly with or without
accompanying cardiac disease. However, these findings are in contrast with previous[14,15] and more
recent[16] findings showing that depressive symptoms
are not associated with an increased risk of stroke in
the elderly. Recent findings from the European
Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk
study[17] also showed that major depressive disorders
are not associated with incident stroke in a large
sample of participants aged 41–80 years.
In addition to these controversies, it is noteworthy
that epidemiological studies examining the association between depression and cardiovascular disease
typically use either CHD or CBVD as the outcome,
rarely do they examine them both within the same
population.[3] This makes it difficult to compare the
predictive power of depression for the two outcomes.
Such comparison is important because differences in
the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic lesions in coronary
and cerebral arteries have been shown,[18,19] even
though CHD and CBVD are characterized by some
common aspects and they share several risk factors.
In this report from the Health and Social Support
(HeSSup) study, we used prospective data from a
large sample of the Finnish population to compare


the importance of depression as a risk factor for
CHD and CBVD within the same population.

## Methods
Population
The HeSSup study is a prospective cohort study on a
population sample representative of the Finnish
population of the following four age groups: 20–24,
30–34, 40–44 and 50–54 years at baseline in 1998,[20] a
total of 10 628 men and 15 267 women. The Turku
University Central Hospital Ethics Committee
approved the study.

Depression
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered
to all participants at baseline in 1998. The BDI[21] is a
21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that
is one of the most widely used instruments for measuring the severity of depression. Each item requires a
response on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 to 3 (total
scores can range from 0 to 63). A score of 510[21] is seen
to separate those participants with subclinical mild to
severe depression from those without depression.
Prescriptions of antidepressant medications were
used as a proxy to capture individuals who were
more likely to have more severe depressive symptoms
using data from the National Drug Prescription
Register data. This register includes outpatient prescription data classified according to the World
Health Organization’s Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical (ATC) classification code and tracks medication purchased from all pharmacies in Finland. The
personal identification numbers (a unique number
assigned to each Finnish citizen) of participants
were used to collect data on date of purchase of antidepressants (ATC code N06A), bought on prescriptions that are written only by physicians in Finland.
These data were drawn from the register for 1998, i.e.
at study baseline, as were responses on the BDI.

Follow-up of CHD and CBVD
The personal identification number of participants
was used to collect records of hospitalizations from
the Finnish National Hospital discharge register and
mortality records from the Statistics Finland register.
These registers provide virtually complete hospital discharge and mortality data and the associated diagnoses of fatal or non-fatal CHD or CBVD events. The
register data have been validated against the
population-based myocardial infarction register for
classifying events using the 2003 American Heart
Association definition.[22] The follow-up for CHD and
CBVD events involved extracting data on the date and
cause of hospitalization and death for all participants
who were treated in a hospital or died between
1 January 1999 and 31 December 2005. Disease endpoint, based on the main diagnoses, was determined

by International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10
codes I20–I25 (CHD) and ICD-10 codes I60–I69
(CBVD).

Health status at baseline
From the Drug Reimbursement Register, we identified
all participants entitled to special reimbursements for
medication to hypertension, diabetes and CHD in
1998, i.e. at study baseline, and excluded from this
study those with entitlements to special reimbursements for CHD. We also excluded all participants hospitalized for CHD or CBVD in 1998 using the National
Hospital Discharge register. Thus, the remaining
sample consisted of participants free of CHD and
CBVD at baseline. Data on hypertension and diabetes
were used as covariates.

Covariates
All background variables were measured at baseline:
sex (male vs female), age groups (20–24, 30–34,
40–44, 50–54 years) and education (basic, secondary,
lower tertiary, higher tertiary). We assessed four
behaviour-related risk factors using standard questionnaire measurements in the baseline survey.
Smoking status was measured with a dichotomous
variable, which describes current regular smoking
(never- or ex-smoker, current smoker, missing data).
The participants reported their habitual frequency and
the amount of beer, wine and spirits consumed. They
were classified as having a high alcohol intake if their
weekly consumption exceeded 16 drinks (200 g of
alcohol) (No vs Yes). Body mass index (BMI), calculated from self-reported weight and height, was used
to measure obesity (BMI 5 30 vs <30 kg/m[2]). Physical
activity was calculated using the metabolic equivalent
task (MET) index to measure sedentary life style

[<2 MET-hours (MET-h) per day] (No vs Yes).

Statistical analysis
Differences in CHD, CBVD and depression (defined as
BDI score 510 or filling antidepressant prescriptions)
as a function of sample characteristics were assessed
using the chi-square test. We examined the relationships between depression and cardiovascular outcomes (CHD and CBVD events) using four serially
adjusted Cox regression models. In model 1, depression and sex, age and education were the sole independent variables. In model 2 and 3, the hazard ratios
(HRs) were adjusted for behavioural (alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyle and smoking) and biological (obesity, hypertension or diabetes and incident
CHD or CBVD) risk factors, respectively. In model 4,
the HRs were simultaneously adjusted for all aforementioned covariates. In addition to these analyses,
we examined the association between continuous BDI
scores to determine the risk of CHD and CBVD associated with a 1-unit increase in BDI. There is no evidence of interactions between depression and sex in


relation to CHD and CBVD status (P40.05), allowing
us to combine men and women in the analyses. The
assumption of proportional hazards assessed examining the time-dependent interaction term between
depression and logarithm of the follow-up period
(time variable) held (all P40.05).

## Results
Of the 25 895 respondents to the baseline survey in
1998, 234 had moved abroad and could not be
included in the follow-up. Data on CHD and CBVD
were linked to survey responses from national health
registers on the basis of a written consent from 24 128
(93%) participants. A total of 23 282 participants with
complete data on covariates were included in the
analyses. A total of 203 incident CHD events (fatal
or non-fatal ischaemic heart disease events) and 129
incident CBVD events (fatal and non-fatal stroke
events: 27 subarachnoid haemorrhages, 23 intracerebral haemorrhages, 55 cerebral infarction, 3 other
non-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage, 19 other
CBVDs, 2 sequelae of cerebral infarction) were documented during the follow-up.
Table 1 presents the differences in CHD, CBVD and
depression as a function of baseline sample characteristics. CHD and CBVD events were higher in men,
older participants, those with lower educational
level, current smokers (not for CBVD), high-alcohol
consumers, obese participants and those with a sedentary life style and with hypertension or diabetes
(P 4 0.026). Depression among participants at baseline (BDI score 510 or filling antidepressant prescriptions) was more likely among women, older people,
those with a lower education, current smokers, high
alcohol consumers, obese people, those more likely to
have a sedentary life style and those with hypertension or diabetes (P 4 0.01).
Table 2 presents the associations between depression
and subsequent CHD and CBVD events using Cox
regression analysis. In model 1, when adjusted for
socio-demographic variables, the HR for CHD was
1.66 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.24–2.24]
for participants with mild to severe depressive symptoms and 2.04 (95% CI 1.27–3.27) for participants
who filled antidepressant prescriptions when compared with those without depression markers. The
risk of CHD for 1-unit increase in the score on the
BDI (continuous variable) was 1.04 (95% CI 1.02–
1.06). For CBVD, the HR adjusted for
socio-demographic factors was 1.01 (95% CI 0.67–
1.53) for participants with mild to severe depressive
symptoms, 1.77 (95% CI 0.95–3.29) for those who
filled antidepressant prescriptions and 1.01 (95% CI
0.99–1.04) for 1-unit increase on the BDI (continuous
variable). In models 2 and 3, adjusted for behavioural
and biological risk factors respectively, these associations were attenuated but the association between
depression and CHD was robust to these adjustments.

In model 4, including simultaneously adjusted for all
aforementioned variables, these associations were further reduced and only the association with CHD
remained evident. The corresponding fully adjusted
HRs were 1.47 (1.08–1.99) and 1.72 (1.06–2.77) for
CHD. For CBVD, these HRs were 0.87 (0.57–1.32)
and 1.52 (0.81–2.84).

Sensitivity analyses
To test the robustness of our findings, we repeated the
analyses excluding CHD and CBVD events that occurred
in the first 2 years of follow-up. These analyses provided
a similar pattern of associations as those presented in


Table 2. For CHD, the number of events was reduced by
31% (n ¼ 145), but the unadjusted HR for participants
with mild to severe depression (BDI score 510) and for
those who filled prescriptions for antidepressant drugs
remained at 2.08 (P < 0.001) and 2.15 (P < 0.006) when
compared with those who were not depressed. The corresponding fully adjusted HRs were 1.94 (P < 0.001)
and 2.00 (P ¼ 0.015). For CBVD, the number of events
was reduced by 26% (n ¼ 97) and the corresponding
unadjusted HRs were 1.03 (P ¼ 0.898) and 1.94
(P ¼ 0.060). The fully adjusted HRs were 0.89
(P ¼ 0.626) and 1.66 (P ¼ 0.155).
We also repeated the analyses excluding definite

only fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction
(n ¼ 142). The HRs from model 1 for participants
with mild to severe depression (BDI score 510) and
for those who filled prescriptions for antidepressant
were 1.95 (P < 0.001) and 2.56 (P < 0.001), respectively, when compared with those who were not
depressed. The corresponding fully adjusted HRs
were 1.62 (P < 0.008) and 2.08 (P ¼ 0.007). These
results are highly consistent with those obtained
including definite angina, leading us to conclude
that the results reported here are not driven by
‘soft’ endpoints.
In addition to these analyses, we examined the association between the severity of depressive symptoms
and the risk of CHD and CBVD by using the standard
cut-offs as follows:[23] scores of 0–9 indicated no
depression, 10–18 indicated mild depression, 19–29
indicated moderate depression and 30–63 indicated
severe depression. For CHD, the unadjusted HRs
were 1.57 (P ¼ 0.008) for participants with mild,
1.81 (P ¼ 0.029) for those with moderate and 2.80
(P ¼ 0.042) for those with severe depressive symptoms. The corresponding fully adjusted HRs were


1.45 (P ¼ 0.0325), 1.58 (P ¼ 0.097) and 2.15
(P ¼ 0.784). For CBVD, the corresponding unadjusted
HRs were 0.93 (P ¼ 0.7553), 0.99 (P ¼ 0.684) and 2.68
(P ¼ 0.094) and fully adjusted HRs were 0.82
(P ¼ 0.435), 0.79 (P ¼ 0.577) and 1.97 (P ¼ 0.255).

## Discussion
In this study we sought to compare the predictive
power of depression for CHD with that for CBVD.
Using a large population sample representative of
the Finnish population in four age groups, we examined the associations between depression and CHD
and CBVD in the same population. Our results show
that participants with mild to severe depressive symptoms (BDI score 5 10) had an increased risk of CHD
but not CBVD. The results also show that participants
who filled antidepressant prescriptions had an
increased risk of CHD but not CBVD. After adjustments for socio-demographics and bio-behavioural
risk factors, only the associations between depression
and incident CHD remained evident. A similar pattern


-----

of associations was observed when the measure of
depression was modelled as a continuous variable.

Comparison with previous studies
To the best of our knowledge this is one of the first
large aetiological studies to examine the associations
of subclinical and clinical depression markers with
CHD and CBVD as specific endpoints within the
same population of men and women without a history of diagnosed CHD or CBVD events at the study
baseline. We found only one study, the Women’s
Health Initiative study,[24] that had examined the
influence of depression symptoms for CHD and
CBVD as specific endpoints in the same population.
Using 6 items from the 20-item Centre for
Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D),
the study showed that in older post-menopausal
women without a history of CHD or CBVD, depressive
symptoms were not associated with an increased risk
of incident stroke: unadjusted and adjusted HRs were
1.09 and 1.01, respectively. Their finding is consistent
with the present results based on a large population
sample representative of the Finnish population in
four equally sized age groups ranging from 20 to 54
years. The CHD and CBVD events in our study were
ascertained using data on hospitalizations from the
Finnish National Hospital Discharge register and mortality data from the Statistics Finland register. Two
validation studies[22,25] have demonstrated that diagnoses of fatal and non-fatal CHD events and causes of
death in these registers were in strong agreement
with major coronary events defined by strict criteria,
justifying their use as endpoint measures in studies.
Strengths of the present study also include the assessment of depression using both pharmacy refill records
of antidepressant medications and a self-reported
measure using a validated questionnaire.
Our results, showing both markers of depression to
be associated with an increased risk of incident CHD,
are consistent with several prospective studies on
healthy people that have demonstrated the predictive
value of depression or depressive symptoms for the
onset of CHD.[4–7] We found the adjusted risk of CHD
to be 1.7 for those with clinically significant depression symptoms, broadly consistent with pooled relative risks of CHD of between 1.64 and 1.80 in recent
meta-analyses.[5–7] It should be noted that we used
prescription of antidepressant medication as a proxy
measure to capture individuals who were more
likely to have clinically significant depression.
However, there is some evidence to suggest that
some antidepressants influence vascular disease
risk[26] and this might explain the stronger effect
between this proxy measure of depression and incident CHD in our study.
We also showed a 1-unit increase in the BDI score
to be associated with an excess CHD risk of 3% (or
63% for a 10-unit increase); this suggests that our
findings were not sensitive to the specific cut-off


used for defining depression using the BDI. These
results are also consistent with the dose–response
association found with CHD when focusing only on
the severity of depressive symptoms (sensitivity
analysis).
As hypertension and/or diabetes are known to influence both mental health and vascular disease
risk,[27–29] we conducted post hoc analyses stratifying
the sample by hypertension and diabetes status. In
participants without hypertension and diabetes, sex–
age–education adjusted HRs for CHD were 1.43
(P ¼ 0.046) for those with mild to severe depressive
symptoms, i.e. scoring 510 on the 21-item BDI, and
1.79 (P ¼ 0.052) for those who filled antidepressant
prescriptions compared with those without these
depression markers. The corresponding fully adjusted
HRs were 1.31 (P ¼ 0.131) and 1.65 (P ¼ 0.096). In
participants with hypertension and diabetes, sex–
age–education adjusted HRs for CHD were 2.27
(P ¼ 0.006) for those with mild to severe depressive
symptoms, i.e. scoring 510 on the 21-item BDI, and
2.43 (P ¼ 0.031) for those who filled antidepressant
prescriptions compared with those without these
depression markers. The corresponding fully adjusted
HRs were 2.67 (P ¼ 0.001) and 2.80 (P ¼ 0.014). These
stratified results provide some evidence that the effect
of depression on CHD might be stronger in participants with a history of diagnosed hypertension and
diabetes.
We found no consistent evidence of an association
between depression symptoms, assessed by the BDI
and categorized into a dichotomous variable using
the standard cut-off, and CBVD, even in analysis
adjusted simply for socio-demographic factors. This
finding is consistent with some previous studies
examining the association between depression and
stroke.[14,15,17] However, the majority of previous studies (six out of nine studies) showing depression to
be[10–12] or not to be a risk factor[14–16] for CBVD have
been conducted in samples of elderly participants in
contrast to our sample of working-aged adults. Two
other studies have found depressive symptoms to be
associated with an increased risk of stroke, but these
findings were based on self-reported stroke[8] or very
few stroke events.[9] Finally, the EPIC-Norfolk study[17]

on 20 627 stroke-free participants (aged 41–80 years)
with 595 incident stroke endpoints found major
depressive disorder not to be associated with incident
stroke. In contrast, psychological distress, a more general measure of mental health well-being, was associated with an increased incidence of stroke in that
cohort. The authors invoked low prevalence of major
depression in their sample as an explanation of the
null finding for major depression. Furthermore,
assessment of major depressive disorder symptoms
was based on a 1-year or lifetime recall, a potential
source of bias due to differential recall. The long
period of recall may also explain the low prevalence
of major depressive disorder in their sample insofar

that people might have recovered from their
depression.
The present finding showing a stronger predictive
power of depression for CHD compared with that
for CBVD is relatively novel due to the fact that
both endpoints were examined in the same study.
There is quite a lot of evidence to support the hypothesis of differential effects of various risk factors,
including depression, on CHD and CBVD. There is
already some evidence of differences in the relative
impact of conventional risk factors for CHD and
CBVD. An early study from the Framingham cohort
found that high cholesterol levels were an important
risk factor for myocardial infarction but not stroke.[30]

In the same vein, more recent large prospective studies have shown that elevated serum cholesterol is a
strong risk factor for CHD, but the association with
stroke varies depending on the stroke subtype. There
is also evidence to suggest that systemic hypertension
is a major risk factor for stroke, whereas its influence
on ischaemic heart disease is less clear, particularly in
the male population.[31] Furthermore, several prospective studies have reported either a U-shaped or no
association between physical activity and stroke,[32]

whereas current evidence clearly indicates its protective influence on CHD risk.[33] Finally, recent guidelines for prevention of stroke suggest that the effect
of alcohol and obesity on stroke is complex and controversial, which is in contrast to the known adverse
effects on CHD.[33] Thus, these differences in CHD and
CBVD risk factors could be a possible explanation of
why depression does not affect them equally.
Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain
how depression may be a risk factor for CHD. Both
biological and behavioural mechanisms have been
shown to mediate the link between depression and
CHD. Depression has been found to be associated
with pathophysiological changes that may increase
the risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality, including
autonomic nervous system dysfunction (e.g. elevated
heart rate, low heart rate variability and exaggerated
heart rate responses to physical stressors),[35] hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysregulation (increased
cortisol secretion),[36] enhanced inflammatory processes (higher levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen)[37] and accelerated progression of
atherosclerosis as indicated by change in carotid
intima-media thickness.[38] Depression could also be
linked to CHD via behaviour-related factors.[39] In our
study, depression markers were found to be associated with current smoking, high alcohol intake, obesity and sedentary life style, suggesting that these
factors are potential mediators for the association
between depression and CHD. Behavioural mediation
was also supported by the finding that the association
between depression and CHD was reduced when
adjusting for behaviour-related factors. However,


further research is needed to examine whether
depression is related to sustained elevated CHD risk
factors trajectories over time and whether it induces
episodic elevations in risk factors, such as blood pressure, which could act as a trigger for coronary events
among employees with subclinical CHD. Some of the
CHD risk factors (e.g. high alcohol intake, sedentary
life style and obesity) may also act as confounders by
increasing the risk of both depression and CHD.
Further studies examining the bidirectional association between bio-behavioural CHD risk factors and
depression are needed in order to disentangle their
temporal sequence.

## Limitations
Interpretation of our findings should be considered
within the context of the limitations of the study.
First, the present study was based on a large population sample representative of the Finnish population
in four age groups, but did not include elderly participants, which may limit the generalizability of our
findings. In particular, this may explain why an association between depression markers and CBVD was
not evidenced in the present study. Secondly, CBVD
endpoint-based on the main diagnosis was defined
using ICD-10 codes I60–I69 (i.e. stroke and other
CBVDs), and did not cover all manifestations of
CBVD, which may limit the generalizability of our
findings to others types of CBVD such as vascular
dementia. Further studies are needed to examine
the association between depression and CBVD subtypes, such as ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke.
Thirdly, we assessed depression only at one point in
time in the present study and did not track the
chronicity or course of depression in relation to CHD
and CBVD. Nevertheless, additional analyses revealed
that the clinically diagnosed depression, based on
filled prescriptions for antidepressant drugs, at the
end of the study (in 2005) was 3.5 times higher for
participants with mild to severe depression symptoms
at study baseline. The corresponding odd was 8.6
times higher for those with severe symptoms at this
time, suggesting a persistence of depressive symptoms
during the follow-up. Moreover, our sensitivity analyses revealed that depression was associated with
CHD even after the removal of events occurring in
the first 2 years of follow-up.

## Conclusions
In this study on working-age adults from a randomly
selected population of Finnish men and women initially free from cardiovascular disease we found that
mild to severely depressed participants had an
increased risk for CHD over the 7 years of follow-up.

There was no clear evidence that depression was
associated with the risk of CBVD, but this result
needs further confirmation.

� The relationship between depression and CBVD continues to be debated although little research has
compared the predictive power of depression for CHD with that for CBVD within the same
population.

� After adjustment for basic socio-demographic factors and bio-behavioural risk factors, participants
with mild to severe depressive symptoms, i.e. those scoring 5 10 on the 21-item BDI, and those who
filled antidepressant prescriptions had an increased risk for CHD over the 7 years of follow-up
compared with those without depression markers.

� There was no clear evidence that depression is a risk factor for CBVD, but this needs further
confirmation.
