Risk Factors for Ischemic Stroke
Dubbo Study of the Elderly
Leon A. Simons, MD; John McCallum, DPhil; Yechiel Friedlander, PhD; Judith Simons, MACS
BackgroundandPurpose—Onein10deathsinAustraliaisduetostroke.Thepredictorsofischemicstrokehavenotbeen
well defined, although hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and previous stroke have been consistently reported. We report
on 98 months’ follow-up in a prospective study of cardiovascular disease in the Australian elderly, the Dubbo Study.
Methods—Thecohort,firstexaminedin1988,wascomposedof2805menandwomen60yearsandolder.Theprediction

antihypertensivedrugs(37%higherrisk),belongingtothehighestcategoryofbloodpressurereading(67%higherrisk),
presence of atrial fibrillation (58% higher risk), HDL cholesterol (36% lower risk for each 1-mmol/L increment),
impaired peak expiratory flow (77% higher risk for tertile I than for tertile III), physical disability (59% higher risk),
and depression score (41% higher risk for tertile III than for tertile I).
Conclusions—These findings suggest that morbidity and mortality associated with ischemic stroke can be predicted by
various clinical indicators, some of which may be amenable to intervention. The matters of impaired peak expiratory
flow, depression score, and ischemic stroke require further study. (Stroke. 1998;29:1341-1346.)
