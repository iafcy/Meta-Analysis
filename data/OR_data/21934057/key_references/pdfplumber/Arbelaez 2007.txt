MultivariateSurvival Analysis
The unadjusted HR of ischemic stroke was 1.32 (95%
CI51.09–1.59) for higher depressive symptoms. After
adding the CRP term (as a continuous variable), the HR
wasnotattenuatedandwasequalto1.31(95%CI51.08–
1.58). After adjustment for sociodemographic characteris-
tics (age, sex, race, occupation, income, education, and
marital status) and traditional stroke risk factors (choles-
terol,HDL-C,LDL-C,triglycerides,BMI,highbloodpres-
sure, diabetes status, and CHD status), depressed
individualshada26%greaterHRofischemicstroke.Add-
ing the CRP term as a continuous variable instead of a
categorical variable to the fully adjusted model, the asso-
ciation between depressive mood and stroke remained
of similar magnitude, and CRP contributed significantly
