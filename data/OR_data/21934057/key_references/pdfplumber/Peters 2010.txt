Abstract
Background:depressioniscommoninelderlypeopleandmaybeassociatedwithincreasedcardiovascularriskandincident
dementia.
Method:participants in theHypertensionin the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) completed a depressionscreening instrument,
the Geriatric Depression Score (GDS), at baseline and annually. We examined the association of GDS score with incident
stroke,mortalityanddementiausingCoxproportionalhazardsmodels(hazardratios,HRand95%confidenceintervals,CI)
adjusted for treatment group and other potential confounders.
Results: 2,656 HYVET participants completed the GDS. The mean follow-up was 2.1 years. A GDS score ≥6 was asso-
ciatedwithincreasedrisksofall-cause(HR1.8,95%CI1.4–2.3)andcardiovascularmortality(HR2.10,95%CI1.5–3.0),all
stroke (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2–2.8) and all cardiovascular events (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2–2.1). Risk of incident dementia also
tendedto be increased (HR1.28, 95% CI 0.95–1.73).Each additional GDSpoint at baselinealso gave rise to a significantly
increased risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality and dementia.
Conclusion: there was a strong association between baseline depression scores and later fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular

Abstract
Background: self-reported body mass index (BMI) based on self-reported height and weight is a widely used measure of
adiposity in epidemiological research. Knowledge about the accuracy of these measures in late life is scarce.
Objective: the study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and changes in accuracy of self-reported height, weight and BMI cal-
culated from self-reported height and weight in late life.
Design: a longitudinal population-based study with five times of follow-up was conducted.
Participants: seven hundred seventy-four community-living men and women, aged 40–88 at baseline (mean age 63.9), in-
cluded in The Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging.
Methods: participants self-reported their height and weight in a questionnaire, and height and weight were measured by
experienced research nurses at an in-person testing five times during a 20-year period. BMI was calculated as weight (kilo-
gramme)/height (metre)2.
Results: latent growth curve modelling showed an increase in the mean difference between self-reported and measured
values over time for height (0.038 cm/year) and BMI (0.016 kg/m2/year), but not for weight.
Conclusions: there is a very small increase in the mean difference between self-reported and measured BMI with ageing,
whichprobablywould not affectthe results when self-reported BMI isused as a continuous variable in longitudinal studies.
