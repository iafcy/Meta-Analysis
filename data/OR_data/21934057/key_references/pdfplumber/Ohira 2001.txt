Background and Purpose—We sought to examine the relationship between depressive symptoms and the incidence of
stroke among Japanese men and women.
Methods—A10.3-yearprospectivestudyontherelationshipbetweendepressivesymptomsandtheincidenceofstrokewas
conducted with 901 men and women aged 40 to 78 years in a rural Japanese community. Depressive symptoms were
measured at baseline with the use of the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). The incidence of stroke was
ascertained under systematic surveillance.
Results—During the 10-year follow-up, 69 strokes (39 ischemic strokes, 10 intracerebral hemorrhages, 10 subarachnoid
hemorrhages,and10unclassifiedstrokes)occurred.Age-andsex-adjustedprevalenceofmilddepression(SDSscores
$40) at baseline was 25% among subjects with incident stroke and 12% among subjects without stroke (P,0.01).

scores in the low tertile. The excess risk was confined to ischemic stroke. After we adjusted for body mass index,
systolic blood pressure level, serum total cholesterol level, cigarette smoking, current treatment with antihypertensive
medication, and history of diabetes mellitus, these relative risks remained statistically significant for total stroke (1.9;
95% CI, 1.1 to 3.5) and ischemic stroke (2.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 6.0).
Conclusions—Depressive symptoms predict the risk of stroke, specifically ischemic stroke among Japanese. (Stroke.
