graphic, psychosocial, and health-related characteristics of subjects. Thereafter interviews were conducted annu-
ally for 6 years. Results: Increasing scores on the modified version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies
Depression Scale (CES-D) were significantly associated with stroke incidence for the overall sample (relative risk
