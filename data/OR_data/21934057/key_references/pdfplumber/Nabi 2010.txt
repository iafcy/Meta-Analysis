Background The relationship between depression and cerebrovascular disease
(CBVD) continues to be debated although little research has com-
pared the predictive power of depression for coronary heart disease
(CHD) with that for CBVD within the same population. This study
aimed to compare the importance of depression for CHD and CBVD
within the same population of adults free of apparent cardiovascu-
lar disease.
Methods A random sample of 23282 adults (9507 men, 13775 women) aged
20–54 years were followed up for 7 years. Fatal and first non-fatal
CHD and CBVD events were documented by linkage to the
National-hospital-discharge and mortality registers.
Results Sex–age–education-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for CHD was 1.66
[95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24–2.24] for participants with
mild to severe depressive symptoms, i.e. those scoring510 on the
21-item Beck Depression Inventory, and 2.04 (1.27–3.27) for those
who filled antidepressant prescriptions compared with those with-
out depression markers in 1998, i.e. at study baseline. For CBVD,
the corresponding HRs were 1.01 (0.67–1.53) and 1.77 (0.95–3.29).
After adjustment for behavioural and biological risk factors these
associations were reduced but remained evident for CHD, the
adjusted HRs being 1.47 (1.08–1.99) and 1.72 (1.06–2.77). For
CBVD, the corresponding multivariable adjusted HRs were 0.87
(0.57–1.32) and 1.52 (0.81–2.84).
Conclusions Self-reported depression using a standardized questionnaire and
clinical markers of mild to severe depression were associated with
an increased risk for CHD. There was no clear evidence that depres-
sion is a risk factor for CBVD, but this needs further confirmation.

KEY MESSAGES
(cid:2) The relationship between depression and CBVD continues to be debated although little research has
compared the predictive power of depression for CHD with that for CBVD within the same
population.
(cid:2) After adjustment for basic socio-demographic factors and bio-behavioural risk factors, participants
with mild to severe depressive symptoms, i.e. those scoring510 on the 21-item BDI, and those who
filled antidepressant prescriptions had an increased risk for CHD over the 7 years of follow-up
compared with those without depression markers.
(cid:2) There was no clear evidence that depression is a risk factor for CBVD, but this needs further
confirmation.
