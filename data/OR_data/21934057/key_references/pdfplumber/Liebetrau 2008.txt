Depression as a Risk Factor for the Incidence of First-Ever
Stroke in 85-Year-Olds
Martin Liebetrau, MD; Bertil Steen, MD, PhD; Ingmar Skoog, MD, PhD
Background and Purpose—Depression may increase the risk for stroke. Few studies have examined whether depression
increasestheriskforstrokeintheveryoldandamongthedemented.Weexaminedtherelationbetweendepressionin
85-year-olds and the 3-year incidence of first-ever stroke.
Methods—A representative sample of 494 85-year-olds (147 demented, 347 nondemented) in Gothenburg, Sweden, was
examined with psychiatric examinations and key informant interviews. Diagnoses of depression and dementia were
madeaccordingtotheDiagnosticandStatisticalManualofMentalDisorders,ThirdRevision.Thesamplewasfollowed
for3yearsregardingtheincidenceofstroke.InformationonstrokewasobtainedfromtheSwedishHospitalDischarge
Register,deathcertificates,self-reports,andkeyinformants.Thosewithknownstrokehistoryatbaseline(n(cid:1)93)were
excluded from the incidence study.
Results—The prevalence of depression at age 85 was 19%. Depression at baseline (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 4.7;

nondemented individuals. Among the symptoms of depression, only depressed mood was an independent predictor of
incidencefirst-everstrokeinmultivariateanalyses.Strokehistoryatage85wasnotassociatedwithclinicaldepression.
Conclusions—Depression and stroke are both common in elderly populations. The finding that depression increases risk
for first-ever stroke indicates that detection and treatment of depression may have implications for stroke prevention.
