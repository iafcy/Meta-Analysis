BackgroundandPurpose—Emergingevidenceraisesthepossibilityofanassociationbetweendepressionandstrokerisk.
This study sought to examine whether depressive symptoms are associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular
events in a community-based sample.
Methods—A prospective study was conducted on 4120 Framingham Heart Study participants aged 29 to 100 years with
up to 8 years of follow-up. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale was used to measure depressive
symptoms.Incidentstrokeandtransientischemicattack(TIA)eventswereassessedbyuniformdiagnosticcriteria.The
associationbetweendepressivesymptomsandriskofstroke/TIAwasanalyzedwithCoxproportional-hazardsmodels,
after adjusting for traditional stroke risk factors.
Results—In participants (cid:1)65 years, the risk of developing stroke/TIA was 4.21 times greater (P(cid:2)(cid:1)0.001) in those with
symptoms of depression. After adjusting for components of the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (hazard ratio(cid:2)3.43,
95% CI(cid:2)1.60 to 7.36, P(cid:2)0.002) and education (hazard ratio(cid:2)4.89, 95% CI(cid:2)2.19 to 10.95), similar results were
obtained.Insubjectsaged65andolder,depressivesymptomswerenotassociatedwithanincreasedriskofstroke/TIA.
Taking antidepressant medications did not alter the risk associated with depressive symptoms.
Conclusions—In this community-based study, depressive symptoms were an independent risk factor for incident
stroke/TIAinindividuals(cid:1)65years.Thesedatasuggestthatidentificationofdepressivesymptomsatyoungeragesmay
have an impact on the primary prevention of stroke. (Stroke. 2007;38:16-21.)
