Background and Purpose—Psychological distress is common after stroke, but little is known about its etiologic
importance, although the general public often ascribes stroke to the experience of stress. Therefore, we examined
whether psychological distress leads to an increased risk of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA).
Methods—Theassociationbetweenthe30-itemGeneralHealthQuestionnaire(GHQ),ameasureofpsychologicaldistress,
and the incidence of nonfatal and fatal ischemic stroke and TIA was measured by Cox regression modeling in a
prospective observational study of 2201 men aged 45 to 59 years in phase II of the Caerphilly cohort. Hazard ratios

was 1.45 (95% CI, 0.98 to 2.14) for those who showed symptoms of psychological distress compared with those who
did not. For fatal stroke the relative risk was 3.36 (95% CI, 1.29 to 8.71) and for nonfatal stroke 1.25 (95% CI, 0.82

afteradjustmentforbodymassindex,systolicbloodpressure,smoking,heavydrinking,socialclass,andmaritalstatus.
However, additionally controlling for previously diagnosed ischemic heart disease, diabetes, respiratory disease, and
retirement due to ill health attenuated the relative risks, but not markedly. For fatal strokes the relative risk decreased
to 2.56 (95% CI, 0.97 to 6.75) when all confounding variables were included in the model. There was a graded
association between degree of psychological distress and risk of fatal ischemic stroke.
Conclusions—Psychological distress is a predictor of fatal ischemic stroke but not of nonfatal ischemic stroke or TIA.
Further work examining the mechanisms of this association is required. (Stroke. 2002;33:7-12.)
