Depressive Disorder, Dysthymia, and Risk of Stroke
Thirteen-Year Follow-Up From the
Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study
Sharon L. Larson, PhD; Pamela L. Owens, PhD; Daniel Ford, MD, MPH; William Eaton, PhD
BackgroundandPurpose—Thisstudyexamineddepressivedisorderasariskfactorforincidentstrokeinaprospective,

ofhouseholdresidentsfromBaltimore,Md.Depressivedisorderwasmeasuredwiththediagnosticinterviewschedule,
and stroke was assessed by questions from the health interview survey or by documentation on a death certificate.
Results—During the 13-year follow-up of 1703 individuals, 66 strokes were reported and 29 strokes were identified by

tobacco. Medications used in the treatment of depressive disorder at baseline did not alter this finding. A history of
dysthymia demonstrated a similar relationship to stroke, although the estimate was not statistically significant.
Conclusions—Depressive disorder is a risk factor for stroke that appears to be independent of traditional cardiovascular
riskfactors.Furtherresearchonmechanismsfortheassociationandtheimpactoftreatmentfordepressivedisorderon
