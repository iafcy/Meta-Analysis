BackgroundandPurpose—Thisstudyassessestheeffectofsocioeconomicstatusonstrokeincidenceintheelderly,and
the contribution of risk factors to stroke disparities.
Methods—Datacomprisedasampleof2812menandwomenaged65yearsandoverfromtheNewHavencohortofthe
Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. Individuals provided baseline information on
demographics, functioning, cardiovascular and psychosocial risk factors in 1982 and were followed for 12 years.
Proportional hazard models were used to model survival from initial interview to first fatal or nonfatal stroke.
Results—Twohundredandseventysubjectsdevelopedincidentstroke.Atages65to74,lowersocioeconomicstatuswas

Conclusions—We observed substantial socioeconomic disparities in stroke at ages 65 to 74, whereas a crossover of
