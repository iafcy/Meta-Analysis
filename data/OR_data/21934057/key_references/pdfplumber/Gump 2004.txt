Depressive Symptoms and Mortality in Men
Results From the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial

Yue-fang Chang, PhD; for the MRFIT Research Group
Background and Purpose—Depression may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. We evaluated
long-term mortality risk associated with depressive symptoms measured at middle age among men at high risk for
coronary heart disease (CHD).
Methods—12866 men without definite evidence of CHD at study entry but who had above average risk of CHD based
on blood pressure, blood cholesterol levels, and/or cigarette smoking were recruited into the Multiple Risk Factor
InterventionTrial(MRFIT).Survivorsattheendofthetrialwerefollowed-upformortalityforanadditional18years.
Men who had completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale near the end of the trial
(n(cid:1)11216) were used in a prospective analysis of post-trial all-cause and cause-specific mortality during 18-year
follow-up after CES-D assessment.
Results—Greater depressive symptoms measured at the end of the trial were associated with significantly higher risk of
all-cause mortality and for cause-specific death, a higher risk of CVD, and, more specifically, stroke mortality (all P
