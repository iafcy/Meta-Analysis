Background: depression is common in elderly people and may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk and incident 
dementia. 
Method: participants in the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) completed a depression screening instrument, 
the Geriatric Depression Score (GDS), at baseline and annually. We examined the association of GDS score with incident 
stroke, mortality and dementia using Cox proportional hazards models (hazard ratios, HR and 95% conﬁdence intervals, CI) 
adjusted for treatment group and other potential confounders. 
Results: 2,656 HYVET participants completed the GDS. The mean follow-up was 2.1 years. A GDS score ≥6 was asso- 
ciated with increased risks of all-cause (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4–2.3) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.5–3.0), all 
stroke (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2–2.8) and all cardiovascular events (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2–2.1). Risk of incident dementia also 
tended to be increased (HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.95–1.73). Each additional GDS point at baseline also gave rise to a signiﬁcantly 
increased risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality and dementia. 
Conclusion: there was a strong association between baseline depression scores and later fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular 
endpoints over a mean follow-up of 2 years in a hypertensive very elderly group. The mechanism of this association warrants 
further study. 


Depression or depressed mood is common among older 
people with an average prevalence of clinically relevant syn- 
dromes estimated at 13.5% at ages ≥55 years [1, 2] and 
higher in women than in men [2]. Many studies have 
found an association between depression, poor quality of 
life and increased risk of cardiovascular disease [3–5]. De- 
pression was associated with an increased risk of coronary 
disease in a meta-analysis [6] and with increased risk of all- 
cause mortality and stroke or transient ischaemic attack in 
the Framingham Heart Study [7, 8]. Plausible causal me- 
chanisms have been put forward in the literature [9–13]. 


Depression may also be associated with increased risk of 
later dementia [14]. 
Depression is common after stroke, heart attack and in 
early dementia [13–15], and is strongly associated with dis- 
ability [16, 17], raising the possibility that the association 
could be confounded or subject to reverse causation. 
The Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) 
[18] enrolled hypertensive people aged ≥80 years. As part 
of a quality-of-life sub-study, depression in HYVET was 
assessed at baseline and then annually using the Geriatric 
Depression Scale (GDS) [19], and provided an opportunity 
to study the association of depression with stroke, cardio- 
vascular morbidity, mortality and dementia in a high-risk 
group of people. 


The HYVET was a randomised double-blind, placebo- 
controlled trial and employed an antihypertensive treatment 
regimen of indapamide sustained release 1.5 mg with the 
optional addition of perindopril 2–4 mg. Ethical and regu- 
latory approvals were obtained prior to data collection. 
All participants were hypertensive deﬁned by a sitting 
systolic blood pressure of ≥160 mmHg and a standing pres- 
sure of ≥140 mmHg, with a baseline diastolic pressure of 
≤110 mmHg. Trial participants were aged ≥80 years, had 
no clinical diagnosis of dementia at baseline and did not re- 
quire daily nursing care. The trial had a 2-month placebo 
run-in phase with collection of baseline data on participant 
characteristics prior to randomisation. Participants gave 
informed consent and were recruited from hospital and 
general practice settings. 
Depression scores were collected using the 15-item GDS 
administered as part of a Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaire 
at baseline and annually thereafter. The QoL questionnaire 
was completed by the respondents willing to participate in this 
sub-study to the main trial. Participants were asked to 
complete the questionnaire themselves prior to having their 
blood pressures measured and other clinical assessments. 
The QoL questionnaire was provided in large text and in 
the local language after being translated, checked and back- 
translated where validated language versions were not previ- 
ously available. Sixty-nine percent of people entering HYVET 
completed the GDS in the baseline QoL questionnaire. 
Those participants completing the QoL questionnaire were 
from centres in Eastern (45.9%) and Western (1.8%) Europe, 
China (49.0%), North Africa (2.6%) and Australasia (0.7%). 
Respondents were instructed to respond ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to 
15 questions relating to how they had been feeling in 
the preceding week. 
reported by the trial investigators and validated by an inde- 
pendent endpoint committee blinded to trial treatment. 
Mortality was further categorised into cardiovascular and 
non-cardiovascular mortality. The endpoint committee re- 
quired copies of the case report forms declaring the event 
and supporting documentation such as death certiﬁcates, 
hospitalisation reports, CT scan reports and information 
on the results of investigations. Where these were provided 
in a language other than English, translations were also 
obtained. The committee included members that were 
representative of the high recruiting countries in HYVET 
and who could read Chinese and Cyrillic scripts. 
Dementia was suspected in those participants who had a 
mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score that fell to 
<24 or by >3 points annually, and in these cases further 
diagnostic information was requested in the form of the 
Diagnostic Statistical Manual criteria, a CT scan (a copy of 
the ﬁlm) and completed Modiﬁed Hachinski Score. A con- 
temporary MMSE was also requested. If the participant did 
not consent to a CT, a full Hachinski score was required. 
The CT scan was evaluated by two independent neuroradiol- 
ogists, and an expert committee made a diagnosis of 
dementia using the diagnostic information in addition to 
other information that had been gathered in the course of

Statistical analysis 
In common with other studies [20–22], we categorised the 
GDS score as a binary variable of a score ≥6 (to indicate 
depression) compared to <6. In secondary analyses, we also 
explored the GDS as a continuous variable. We used Cox 
proportional hazards models to investigate the association 
between the baseline GDS score with all-cause and cardio- 
vascular mortality, fatal and non-fatal stroke events, fatal and 
non-fatal cardiovascular events (including cardiovascular 
mortality, all stroke, all heart failure and all MI) and incident 
dementia. 
Analyses were carried out for the association of GDS 
score with outcome (i) unadjusted, (ii) adjusted for treat- 
ment group and (iii) adjusted for multiple factors including 
age, sex, treatment allocation, country area, educational level, 
living alone, number of co-morbidities, previous cardiovas- 
cular disease, previous treatment and previously diagnosed 
hypertension. Proportional hazards assumptions were tested. 
This paper presents baseline GDS data and its relationship 
to subsequent trial endpoints. Eﬀect of trial treatment on 
GDS scores will be published separately. 

A total of 2,656 completed questionnaires were received 
with GDS information and for 2,320 of these longitudinal 
MMSE data were also available (and therefore the possibility 
of assessment for incident dementia). 
The participants who completed the QoL questionnaires 
were of a similar age to those who did not (mean age of 
those who completed the QoL was 83.5 years compared 
with 83.7 years) and sex, with 60.6% female compared with 
60.2%. Mean follow-up was 2.06 years with only 17 partici- 
pants being lost to follow-up during the HYVET. 
A third of participants (n=887) had GDS scores of ≥6 
indicating depressed mood, although investigators reported 
clinical depression in only 15 (0.6%). When this was exam- 
ined by prior cardiovascular disease (stroke, myocardial 
infarction or heart failure; previous CVD), 32.3% of those 
without previous CVD reported GDS scores ≥6 compared 
to 40.8% in those with previous CVD. 
The baseline characteristics of patients with a GDS of 
≥6 compared with those with GDS <6 are shown in Table 1. 
A score of ≥6 was associated with being older, a female, a 
baseline history of CVD, some level of education, living alone, 
a slightly higher sitting systolic blood pressure, an increased 
number of co-morbidities and a slightly lower baseline 
MMSE. 
Of those who completed QoL questionnaires, 294 (11%) 
participants died during follow-up; 146 (5.5%) of these were 
classiﬁed as cardiovascular deaths. There were 233 (8.8%) 
cardiovascular events and 173 (7.5%) cases of incident 
dementia. 
A baseline GDS score of ≥6 was associated with a sig- 
niﬁcantly increased risk of all-cause mortality [hazard ratio 
(HR) 1.8, 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) 1.4–2.3], all stroke 


(HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3–2.8), cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.2, 
95% CI 1.6–3.1) and cardiovascular events (HR 1.7, 95% CI 
1.3–2.2) (Table 2). These hazard ratios were not substantially 
changed after adjustment for treatment or in the fully ad- 
justed model. When sensitivity and speciﬁcity values were 
calculated for a GDS of ≥6 compared to a GDS of <6, 
speciﬁcity was high, >90% for all-cause mortality, all 
stroke, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events and 
dementia. Corresponding sensitivity values were low at 
16% for all-cause mortality, 5% for stroke, 9% for cardio- 
vascular mortality, 12% for cardiovascular events and 10% 
for dementia. 
Similar results were observed in the analysis for GDS as a 
continuous variable (Table 3). In these analyses, there was an 
additional association with increased risk of dementia both 
in unadjusted analyses and when adjusted for multiple con- 
founders (Table 3). Further adjustment adding baseline 
sitting systolic blood pressure, smoking and consumption 
of alcohol at baseline to the multivariate analysis made little 
material diﬀerence to the eﬀect sizes. 
Further examination of these relationships by subgroups 
of gender, ethnicity (Chinese versus non-Chinese) and pres- 
ence of previous cardiovascular disease resulted in point 
estimates over unity for all outcomes and the majority of sub- 
groups retaining signiﬁcance. Caution must be applied in this 
area as although the association of the GDS and subsequent 
events was planned a priori, the evaluation of subgroups was 
not. The subgroups are by deﬁnition smaller than the main 
data set and, in the case of ethnicity, are also aﬀected by length 
of follow-up with the Chinese patients entering the trial later 
and therefore contributing less patient years. 

We found that a GDS score of ≥6 was associated with an 
increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and 
cardiovascular morbidity. The relationship between depres- 
sion, mortality and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity 
is likely to be complex, with potential for confounding 
and reverse causation as well as a possible causal relationship 
between depressed mood and mortality or cardiovascular 
outcomes. 
Mood was worse in those with a prior cardiovascular 
event [11–13, 15]. The association between mood and out- 
comes was seen over a relatively short follow-up period of 
2 years. These suggest the possibility of reverse causation: 
outcome cardiovascular events may have reﬂected the great- 
er occurrence, on average, of recurrent events in those with 
cardiovascular disease at recruitment. 
There is a possibility of confounding by unmeasured dis- 
ability. But adjusting for prior events, or other potential 
confounders, did not alter the risk estimates (although the 
possibility of residual confounding remains). 
A further possibility is that depressed mood causes car- 
diovascular disease and mortality. This could be by several 
mechanisms such as less physical exercise, worse diet, the 

eﬀects of antidepressant drugs or other postulated pathways 
including hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, endothelial injury, 
progressive atherosclerosis and thrombus formation [3–5]. 
This raises the possibility that treatment of depression could 
reduce the risk of vascular disease. Our ﬁndings require rep- 
lication and exclusion of some alternative possibilities (such 
as following up a population known to be free of vascular 
disease or disability at baseline, or carefully controlling for 
the confounding eﬀect of disability) before testing in an 
intervention trial. 
A third of participants in the quality-of-life sub-study of 
the HYVET had GDS scores of ≥6, indicating depressed 
mood. This is much higher than found in population stud- 
ies [20–22], and a possible limitation of the study is the 
use of the GDS, especially across diﬀerent countries and 
cultures. However, the GDS is a well-established and a 
good screening instrument for depression, and was de- 
signed for use among older people [23–31]. Multiple 
cut-oﬀ points have been used with varying levels of sen- 
sitivity and speciﬁcity, the most frequently used, as in our 
study, being 5/6 with higher scores indicating more severe 
depression [23]. With cut oﬀs <6/6+, the 15-item GDS 
has a speciﬁcity for depression of 93.7% and sensitivity of 
50%, respectively. 
Respondents who completed the GDS were representa- 
tive of the HYVET population and were very elderly, with 
the majority being female. They were hypertensive but rela- 
tively healthy, with a mean number of co-morbidities of 
1.7, and almost 20% were living alone. The mean MMSE 
of participants was 24.6 (SD 4.5), a score compatible with 
their age and varied levels of education [23]. 
A strength of the study was the administration of the 
questionnaire with the answers provided by the patients 
before commencing the trial clinical examination. This 
may have provided a more accurate representation of the 
respondents’ views than would be reﬂected in the low levels 
of depression reported by the investigators. 
The HYVET is the ﬁrst to study a large population 
of very elderly individuals with hypertension and to have 
included the assessment of depression using the GDS. 

limitations. We report here 
the association between baseline GDS scores and later 
events; however, the study was not designed to investigate 
this and was stopped early at the time of the second in- 
terim analysis due to a positive ﬁnding in favour of active 
treatment, resulting in a relatively short mean follow-up of 
2.1 years. Moreover, although participants were unable to 
enter the study if they required nursing care, we did not 
collect rigorous information about activities of daily living, 
disability levels or maintenance of social networks, socio- 
economic status or activity level. Participants were all 
hypertensive, and although a proportion of them were re- 
ported to have previous cardiovascular disease, there may 
also have been unreported or subclinical disease that we 
were not able to take into account. There is, therefore, 
the potential for uncontrolled confounding from unmeas- 
ured factors, including those above, or of reverse causality 
whereby unreported or unrecognised ischaemic events lead 
to depression rather than the other way around. 



(cid:129) Higher depression scores were associated with an in- 
creased risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event, 
mortality and possibly dementia.

Agreement between self-reported and measured 
height, weight and body mass index in old age— 
a longitudinal study with 20 years of follow-up

Background: self-reported body mass index (BMI) based on self-reported height and weight is a widely used measure of 
adiposity in epidemiological research. Knowledge about the accuracy of these measures in late life is scarce. 
Objective: the study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and changes in accuracy of self-reported height, weight and BMI cal- 
culated from self-reported height and weight in late life. 
Design: a longitudinal population-based study with ﬁve times of follow-up was conducted. 
Participants: seven hundred seventy-four community-living men and women, aged 40–88 at baseline (mean age 63.9), in- 
cluded in The Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. 
Methods: participants self-reported their height and weight in a questionnaire, and height and weight were measured by 
experienced research nurses at an in-person testing ﬁve times during a 20-year period. BMI was calculated as weight (kilo- 
gramme)/height (metre)2. 
Results: latent growth curve modelling showed an increase in the mean diﬀerence between self-reported and measured 
values over time for height (0.038 cm/year) and BMI (0.016 kg/m2/year), but not for weight. 
Conclusions: there is a very small increase in the mean diﬀerence between self-reported and measured BMI with ageing, 
which probably would not aﬀect the results when self-reported BMI is used as a continuous variable in longitudinal studies. 


Older people are at a high risk of functional impairment and 
morbidity. Body mass index (BMI), calculated as kg/m², 
might give an estimation of a person's health status. In the 
prediction and treatment of various diseases, the trajectory 
of BMI over time might be of greater clinical value than a sin- 
gle assessment. In epidemiological studies, BMI values are 
often based on self-reported weight and height (hence forth 
called self-reported BMI). The accuracy of self-reported 
BMI in old age has been evaluated by only a few studies, 
and to our knowledge, the accuracy of self-reported height, 
weight and BMI has not been previously studied in a longi- 
tudinal trial including older people.
