Symptoms of Depression as a Prospective Risk Factor for Stroke 
BRUCE S. JONAS, SCM, PHD, AND MICHAEL E. MUSSOLINO, MA 
Objective: The objective of this study was to assess baseline levels of depression as a risk factor for stroke among 
white and black men and women. Methods: A population-based cohort of 6095 stroke-free white and black men and 
women aged 25 to 74 years in the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study were followed for an average of 16 
years to a maximum of 22 years. The association between stroke and baseline self-reported depressive symptom- 
atology was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for baseline age, race, sex, education, 
smoking status, body mass index, alcohol use, nonrecreational physical activity, serum cholesterol level, history of 
diabetes, history of heart disease, and systolic blood pressure. Hospital records and death certificates were used to 
identify stroke cases; a total of 483 cases were identified. Results: In age-adjusted models for all persons, white men, 
white women, and black persons of both sexes, depression was predictive of stroke. In risk-adjusted models for all 
persons (relative risk (RR) 5 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5 1.30 –2.31) and for white men (RR 5 1.68, 95% 
CI 5 1.02–2.75), depression remained predictive of stroke. For white women, depression (RR 5 1.52, 95% CI 5 
0.97–2.38) reached borderline significance (p 5 .07). For black persons, depression (RR 5 2.60, 95% CI 5 
1.40 – 4.80) demonstrated a higher risk of stroke. A series of supplemental analyses also supported the association 
between depression and stroke. Conclusions: Depression is predictive of stroke across all strata. This nationally 
representative study gives evidence of a prospective association between depression and stroke. Key words:

Epidemiologic studies have identified important 
risk factors for stroke, including low levels of physical 
activity, high serum cholesterol levels, obesity, alcohol 
use, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, and hyper- 
tension (1–3). Depression commonly occurs after a 
stroke, with a prevalence as high as 30% in the first 
year after the event (4). However, there has been rela- 
tively little research on depression as a potential pre- 
cursor of stroke even though depression has been iden- 
tified as a significant risk factor for hypertension (5) 
and coronary heart disease (6 –11). Depression may 
also affect other stroke risk factors. Previous studies

have shown that depressive symptomatology is asso- 
ciated with a higher prevalence of smoking (12) and 
lower levels of physical activity (13, 14). 
Several recent prospective studies provide evidence 
of an association between depression and risk of 
stroke. Everson et al. (15) found an elevated risk of 
mortality due to stroke among depressed individuals 
in a community sample of initially stroke-free adults 
from Alameda County, California. Data on morbidity 
due to stroke were not available. Simonsick et al. (16) 
found an elevated risk of stroke among elderly hyper- 
tensive men and women who reported high levels of 
depressive symptoms. Wassertheil-Smoller et al. (17) 
also studied stroke risk among elderly hypertensive 
men and women. Although these investigators did not 
find an elevated stroke risk related to baseline depres- 
sive symptoms, they did find that an increase in de- 
pression over time was prognostic. However, it was 
not possible to determine in either study whether 
symptoms of depression preceded or followed the on- 
set of hypertension. Furthermore, Colantonio et al. (18) 
did not find an elevated risk of stroke among de- 
pressed elderly men and women after adjusting for 
known stroke risk factors. Together, the results of these 
prospective studies show an inconsistent relationship 
between depression and stroke. 
We examined the role of depressive symptomatol- 
ogy in the subsequent development of stroke in the 
NHEFS, a study of a representative sample of the US 
population that used standardized assessments of de- 
pressive symptoms at baseline and followed partici- 
pants for up to 22 years. Separate analyses were per- 
formed for white men and women. Black men and 
women were combined to obtain an adequate number 
of stroke cases (19). We hypothesized that after adjust- 
ing for possible confounders, depressive symptomatol- 

ogy in white men, white women, and all blacks would 
be associated with an increased risk of stroke. 


Data for these analyses were obtained from the NHANES I and 
NHEFS. In NHANES I, information was collected from a national 
probability sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized population 
aged 1 to 74 years from 1971 through 1975. The survey consisted of 
a standardized medical examination and questionnaires on various 
topics (20 –22), such as general medical history, 24-hour dietary 
intake recall, and a food frequency interview. Additional data were 
gathered from the detailed sample of adults aged 25 to 74 years (N 5 
6913). These subjects provided supplemental information about 
their medical history and healthcare needs, completed a general 
well-being questionnaire, and underwent a more detailed medical 
examination. The baseline cohort for the NHEFS consisted of the 
14,407 persons aged 25 to 74 years who completed the physical 
examinations in the cross-sectional NHANES I survey (70% of the 
original cross-sectional sample). Follow-up surveys were conducted 
from 1982 through 1984, in 1986 (for those aged 55 years and older 
at baseline), and in 1987 and 1992 (23–26). Of the original NHEFS 
sample, only 5% were lost to follow-up at all four follow-up surveys. 
The analysis presented here included individuals who were 25 to 
74 years old at baseline and who underwent the detailed medical 
examination (N 5 6913). Only white and black persons were in- 
cluded because of the small numbers of persons of other races. Of the 
6833 individuals eligible for study, 358 were unavailable for fol- 
low-up at all four periods, 116 had a history of stroke at baseline, and 
264 had unknown values for one or more variables assessed in the 
study. Thus, after all exclusions, 6095 persons were available for 
analysis. 

The GWB-D (27) was administered at baseline in mobile exami- 
nation centers by trained interviewers (blind to study objectives and 
hypotheses) to the sample of adults aged 25 to 74 years who had 
undergone the detailed medical examination. The GWB-D consists 
of four items, all of which ask subjects to rate the severity of symp- 
toms experienced during the past month. The items are as follows: 1) 
“Have you felt downhearted and blue?” (this item has 6 response 
categories scored from 0 to 5, with 0 5 “all of the time” and 5 5 
“none of the time”); 2) “How have you been feeling in general?” (6 
response categories scored from 0 to 5, with 0 5 “in very low spirits” 
and 5 5 “in excellent spirits”); 3) “Have you felt so sad, discouraged, 
hopeless, or had so many problems that you wondered if anything 
was worthwhile?” (6 response categories scored from 0 to 5, with 0 5 
“extremely so—to the point that I have just about given up” and 5 5 
“not at all”); and 4) “How DEPRESSED or CHEERFUL have you 
been?” (11 response categories scored from 0 to 10, with 0 5 “very 
depressed” and 10 5 “very cheerful”). The GWB-D score is the sum 
of these items and ranges from 0 to 25; lower scores indicate more 
depression and higher scores indicate more cheerfulness. For these 
analyses, scores on the GWB-D were trichotomized as follows: 
scores of 0 to 12 indicated a high level of depressive symptoms; 
scores of 13 to 18, intermediate symptoms; and scores of 19 to 25, 
low symptoms. A score of 0 to 12 has been shown to give a good 
approximation of high depressive symptoms (28). High scores reflect 
responses indicating few or no depressive symptoms (27). The in- 
termediate group was constructed as the balance between the high 

and low symptoms groups, and scores in this range reflect responses 
indicating moderate levels of depressive symptoms (27). 
The GWB-D measures self-reported symptoms of depression; 
thus, a score indicating high depressive symptoms is not synony- 
mous with a clinical diagnosis of depression. However, the GWB-D 
has been shown to predict clinically trained interviewers’ ratings of 
depression (27). GWB-D scores have also been correlated with scores 
on other instruments designed to assess clinical depression, includ- 
ing the Zung Depression Scale (r 5 0.62), the Personal Feelings 
Inventory-Depression (r 5 0.67), and the Psychiatric Symptoms 
Scale-Depression (r 5 0.70) (27) In the NHANES I sample that 
underwent detailed medical examination, the internal consistency 
of the GWB-D scale was 0.77 (29). Furthermore, in a 9-year longitu- 
dinal study, Costa et al. (30) demonstrated that the level of negative 
affect was relatively stable over time among NHEFS participants 
aged 25 to 74 years. Given the size and representativeness of the 
sample, this is strong evidence of the stability of mean levels of 
negative affect in adulthood. 

Hospital records and death certificates were used to identify 
stroke cases; a total of 483 cases were identified. At each follow-up 
survey, participants were asked to report all hospital stays since the 
previous interview. Hospitals named during an interview were con- 
tacted, with permission from the subject, and discharge summaries 
were obtained for all hospital stays occurring during the period, 
including stays not mentioned during the interview. A discharge 
diagnosis of stroke (ICD-9 codes 431 to 434.9, 436, and 437.0 to 
437.1) identified a case (31, 32). Up to 10 diagnoses could be listed 
on a single record. The hospital admission date was used as the date 
of stroke occurrence. For persons with more than one record listing 
a stroke, the earliest admission date was used. All death certificates 
were also searched for any mention of these ICD-9 codes (ie, under- 
lying cause or up to 20 ancillary conditions). For cases identified by 
both a hospital record and death certificate, the date of stroke oc- 
currence was taken from the hospital record. Seventy-six cases were 
identified only from death certificates. 

Our multivariate analyses included several variables previously 
identified as related to stroke risk, including age at baseline, educa- 
tional attainment (,12, $12 years), smoking status (current, not 
current), alcohol consumption in the past year (none, any), nonrec- 
reational physical activity (three categories: much, moderate, or 
none), history of diabetes, and history of heart disease. At the be- 
ginning of the baseline physical examination, the physician mea- 
sured blood pressure once with the subject seated (33). BMI (mea- 
sured in kg/m2) was calculated from the height and weight recorded 
at baseline. Baseline blood samples were obtained, and frozen sera 
were sent to the then Centers for Disease Control for determination 
of serum cholesterol level (20, 34). 

Incidence rates for stroke are calculated per 1000 person-years of 
follow-up. The significance of differences in risk factor means or 
proportions between high and low depressive symptoms categories 
was tested by means of unadjusted least-squares estimates using the 
SAS general linear models procedure (35). To control for all risk 
factors simultaneously and to account for unequal lengths of follow- 
up, Cox proportional hazards regression models (SAS procedure 



PHREG) were used to model time to the event and to calculate 
estimates of the relative risk of stroke and associated 95% confi- 
dence intervals (36, 37). PHREG performs regression analysis of 
survival data based on the Cox proportional hazards model. The Cox 
model is the preferred model for analyzing NHEFS data because it 
takes into account different lengths of follow-up and does not re- 
quire assumptions about the distribution of survival time (38). 
Length of follow-up was calculated as the time from the date of 
examination to the date of a stroke (cases) or to the date of the last 
follow-up interview or death (noncases). Participants were followed 
up for a mean length of 16.0 years (maximum length 5 21.8 years). 
The SAS-callable SUDAAN survival procedure was used to check 
for changes in stroke risk after using sampling weights (39). Because 
the weights and complex survey design variances did not change the 
overall conclusions of the study, only unweighted results are pre- 
sented.

depressive symptoms category. For all race and sex 
groups, persons reporting high as compared with low 
depressive symptoms were significantly more likely to 
report a low level of nonrecreational physical activity, 
less than high school education, and a history of dia- 
betes. White men and white women in the high de- 
pressive symptoms category were more likely to be 
current smokers. White women in the high depressive 
symptom category were more likely to have a higher 
BMI and a history of heart disease. Depressed blacks 
more often reported a history of heart disease. All 
other risk factors were comparable across depressive 
symptoms categories. 
Table 2 shows the number and percentage of re- 
spondents and the number of stroke cases by race, sex, 
and depressive symptoms category. Blacks had the 
largest percentage of subjects reporting high depres- 
sive symptoms (15.7%), followed by white women 
(10.4%) and white men (5.6%). Blacks and white 
women also had higher percentages of subjects report- 
ing an intermediate level of depressive symptoms 
compared with white men. Age-adjusted incidence 
rates are shown in Figure 1. For white men, white 
women, and all black persons, the incidence rate for 
stroke was highest for persons with high depressive 
symptoms, followed by persons with intermediate and 
then low depressive symptoms.

was associated with a significant increase in stroke 
risk for all three groups. After controlling for known 
risk factors, the relative risk of stroke remained signif- 
icantly elevated for white men with high levels of 
depressive symptoms (RR 5 1.68, CI 51.02–2.75, p 5 
.04) compared with those with low depressive symp- 
toms. Stroke risk for white women with high depres- 
sive symptoms also remained marginally significant 
(RR 5 1.52, CI 50.97–2.38, p 5 .07). Adjustment for 
additional risk factors did not reduce the excess risk 
associated with high depressive symptoms among 
blacks (RR 5 2.60, CI 5 1.40 – 4.80, p 5 .00). 

Because depressive symptomatology may be associ- 
ated with occult cerebrovascular disease, we excluded 
individuals who may have had an undiagnosed stroke 
at the beginning of the study by excluding stroke cases 
that occurred within 3 years after the baseline exami- 
nation (N 5 43). After these exclusions, the age-ad- 
justed relative risks of stroke associated with high de- 
pressive symptomatology were little changed (white 
men: RR 5 1.73, CI 5 1.02–2.91, p 5 .04; white wom- 
en: RR 5 1.90, CI 5 1.21–2.97, p 5 .01; and blacks: 
RR 5 2.12, CI 5 1.20 –3.74, p 5 .01). The fully adjusted 
relative risks were slightly reduced but still elevated 
among white men (RR 5 1.59, CI 5 0.93–2.72, p 5 .09), 
virtually unchanged for white women (RR 5 1.53, CI 5

increases in age, SBP, or serum cholesterol level were 
associated with increased stroke risk. Among the cat- 
egorical measures, men, current smokers, persons with 
a history of diabetes or heart disease, and persons 
reporting a high (RR 5 1.73, CI 5 1.30 –2.31, p 5 .00) 
or intermediate level (RR 5 1.25, CI 5 1.02–1.52, p 5 
.03) of depressive symptoms had an increased risk of 
stroke. 
Table 4 shows the age-adjusted and risk-adjusted 
relative risks of stroke associated with depression for 
white men, white women, and all blacks. For all three 
groups, the pattern of relative risks demonstrated a 
gradient from high to low symptomatology. In the age- 
adjusted models, a high level of depressive symptoms 



0.96 –2.44, p 5 .07), and slightly higher for blacks 
(RR 5 2.70, CI 5 1.41–5.14, p 5 .00). Similar results 
were found when stroke cases that occurred within the 
first 5 and 10 years after the baseline examination were 
excluded. 

Because depressive symptomatology is known to be 
elevated among persons with heart disease or diabetes 
(40, 41), we reexamined the relationship between base- 
line levels of depression and subsequent stroke after 
excluding individuals who reported a history of heart 
disease or diabetes (N 5 651). The age-adjusted rela- 
tive risks of stroke associated with high depressive 
symptomatology were relatively unchanged for all 
strata (white men: RR 5 1.75, CI 5 0.96 –3.19, p 5 .07; 
white women: RR 5 1.73, CI 5 1.02–2.94, p 5 .04; and 
blacks: RR 5 2.33, CI 5 1.22– 4.46, p 5 .01). These 
exclusions resulted in a somewhat stronger risk-ad- 
justed relative risk of stroke associated with high de- 
pressive symptoms for white men (RR 5 1.89, CI 5 
1.02–3.47, p 5 .04) and for blacks (RR 5 2.70, CI 5 
1.33–5.49, p 5 .01), but there was little difference in 
the point estimate for white women (RR 5 1.45, CI 5 
0.83–2.51, p 5 .19) (see Table 4). 

To investigate whether age modified the associa- 
tions between depression and stroke, we reexamined 
the data by baseline age group (25–59 and 60 –74 
years). Among the 4475 subjects aged 25 to 59 years 
and the 1620 subjects aged 60 to 74 years, the crude 
incidence rates for stroke were 3.9% and 19.0%, re- 
spectively. Of the 483 stroke cases identified, 307 
(63.6%) were among persons aged 60 to 74 years and 
176 (36.4%) were among persons aged 25 to 59 years at 
baseline. Because of sample size constraints (ie, num- 
ber of stroke events), it was not possible to further 
stratify by age within defined race and sex groups, nor 
was it possible to stratify into three age groups to 
specify a younger group (eg, 25– 44 years). In models 
adjusting for age (continuous), sex, and race, high and 
intermediate levels of depressive symptoms were as- 
sociated with stroke in both age groups. Similar results 
were found in models adjusting for all risk factors. For 
subjects aged 25 to 59 years, stroke risk was associated 
with high depressive symptoms (RR 5 2.01, CI 5 1.27– 
3.18, p 5 .00); the association did not reach signifi- 
cance for intermediate depressive symptoms (RR 5 
1.32, CI 5 0.95–1.85, p 5 .10). For subjects aged 60 to 
74 years, stroke risk was increased for those with high 
levels of depressive symptoms (RR 5 1.62, CI 5 1.12– 
2.34, p 5 .01) and was marginally significant for those 
with intermediate levels of depressive symptoms 
(RR 5 1.25, CI 5 0.97–1.61, p 5 .09). 
Controlling for Anxiety 
Depression and anxiety are correlated (r 5 0.75) in 
this cohort. To determine whether controlling for anx- 
iety would attenuate results for depression and stroke, 
we reexamined the data, including the score on the 
Anxiety Scale of the General Well-Being Schedule as 
an additional covariate (5). For all subjects in models 
adjusting for age, sex, and race, the relative risks of 
stroke associated with depressive symptomatology 
were relatively unchanged for high (RR 5 1.86, CI 5 
1.31–2.65, p 5 .00) and intermediate levels (RR 5 1.27, 
CI 5 1.02–1.60, p 5 .04). In models adjusting for all 
risk factors, relative risks were similarly unaffected for 
high (RR 5 1.80, CI 5 1.26 –2.57, p 5 .00) and inter- 
mediate levels (RR 5 1.23, CI 5 0.98 –1.54, p 5 .08). In 
all models, neither high nor intermediate levels of 
anxiety were significantly related to stroke. 

If depression is associated with an increased risk of 
stroke, one might ask whether cheerfulness protects 
against stroke. One might also ask whether cheerful- 
ness, if simultaneously assessed, would attenuate the 
relationship between depression and stroke. To ad- 
dress these questions, we looked at the high end of the 
GWB-D score distribution (scores of 23–25); 20.3% of 
subjects had scores in this range, indicating high levels 
of cheerfulness. This variable was then entered into 
models along with high and intermediate depressive 
symptoms. For all subjects in models adjusting for all 
risk factors, high levels of cheerfulness were not sig- 
nificantly protective against stroke. In these models, 
the relative risks of stroke associated with high and 
intermediate depressive symptoms were virtually un- 
changed. Similar results were found when high cheer- 
fulness was redefined as scores of 24 to 25 (top 11.2%) 
and scores of 25 (top 4.6%). 

The GWB-D includes hopelessness as one of its 
component items. Anda et al. (6), using NHEFS data 
through 1987, found that hopelessness, in addition to 
the entire GWB-D, was predictive of ischemic heart 
disease. To assess whether hopelessness was related to 
stroke incidence, we similarly defined hopelessness 
using the same grouping and response categories: se- 
vere (scores of 0 and 1), moderate (2 and 3), and none/ 


low (4 and 5). Among all 6095 subjects, 221 (3.6%) 
reported severe levels and 718 (11.8%) reported mod- 
erate levels of hopelessness. For all subjects in models 
adjusting for age, sex, and race, stroke was associated 
with severe (RR 5 1.66, CI 5 1.13–2.44, p 5 .01) and 
moderate levels of hopelessness (RR 5 1.44, CI 5 
1.11–1.87, p 5 .01). In models adjusting for all risk 
factors, stroke was associated with severe levels of 
hopelessness (RR 5 1.52, CI 5 1.02–2.25, p 5 .04); the 
association between stroke and moderate levels of 
hopelessness was marginally significant (RR 5 1.27, 
CI 5 0.98 –1.66, p 5 .08). 

To determine the graded risk associated with a one- 
point change in the continuum of depressive symp- 
toms, the GWB-D was analyzed as a continuous mea- 
sure. For all subjects in models adjusting for age, sex, 
and race, the relative risk of stroke associated with a 
one-point increase in the depression score was 1.04 
(CI 5 1.02–1.06, p 5 .00). In models adjusting for all 
risk factors, the relative risk was unchanged (RR 5 
1.04, CI 5 1.01–1.06, p 5 .00). 

We examined the prospective relationship between 
depressive symptomatology and stroke incidence 
among 6095 white and black men and women aged 25 
to 74 years. The findings of this large, nationally rep- 
resentative study lend additional support to a signifi- 
cant association between depressive symptoms and 
subsequent stroke incidence. After adjustment for es- 
tablished stroke risk factors (ie, age, sex, race, SBP, 
education, smoking status, BMI, alcohol use, nonrec- 
reational physical activity, serum cholesterol level, 
history of diabetes, and history of heart disease), indi- 
viduals with a high level of depressive symptoms had 
a 50% to 160% increased risk of stroke during the 
subsequent 22 years compared with subjects with low 
levels of depressive symptoms. The consistency of the 
significance of these associations was observed across 
the race-sex strata of white men, white women, and all 
blacks. Blacks had an increased risk of stroke associ- 
ated with high depressive symptomatology in compar- 
ison with whites. In general, the risk-adjusted models 
did not substantially attenuate risks in comparison 
with age-adjusted models. 
This does not imply that other covariates consid- 
ered here were not predictive of stroke. The overall 
analysis presented in Table 3 showed that, in addition 
to high and intermediate levels of depressive symp- 
toms, age, sex, smoking status, SBP, serum cholesterol 

level, history of diabetes, and history of heart disease 
were all predictive of stroke incidence. Among the 
categorical variables, a high level of depressive symp- 
toms seems to be a strong predictor, with a relative risk 
of 1.73 (about the same as that for sex, 1.74). Among 
the continuous variables modeled, age is clearly the 
strongest predictor; SBP and serum cholesterol level 
were also prognostic. To place the relative risk of high 
depressive symptomatology into context, the effect of 
the relative risk of depression was roughly comparable 
to a 40-point increase in baseline SBP. 
In addition, consistent associations between depres- 
sion and stroke were observed in a variety of supple- 
mental models. In models that excluded early stroke 
events, depression continued to be prognostic of 
stroke. In models that excluded individuals with heart 
disease or diabetes at baseline, the depression-stroke 
connection was similarly unaffected. Wassertheil- 
Smoller et al. (17) and Penninx et al. (42) showed that 
only change in depression over time, rather than base- 
line depression, was predictive of future cardiovascu- 
lar events. This finding implies that vascular disease 
could be a potential cause of both subsequent depres- 
sion and stroke. Because baseline depression was pre- 
dictive of stroke in the analyses reported here, and 
because the impact of excluding early stroke cases (up 
to 10 years after the NHANES I examination) or sub- 
jects with baseline heart disease or diabetes on these 
analyses was minimal, we conclude that baseline vas- 
cular disease leading first to depression and subse- 
quently to stroke is not a likely explanation for the 
observed associations. Baseline age was a strong pre- 
dictor of stroke incidence, with incidence rates rising 
sharply with increasing age. However, analyses strati- 
fied by age showed that depression was consistently 
associated with stroke incidence in both the younger 
(25–59 years) and older (60 –74 years) age groups. 
Thus, age did not seem to modify the effects of depres- 
sion on stroke. 
Anxiety is a correlate of depression. However, anx- 
iety was not associated with stroke, nor did its inclu- 
sion in models attenuate the association between de- 
pression and stroke. Although we cannot rule out the 
possibility that the depression measure overlaps with 
other psychological domains, the results of this anal- 
ysis support the argument that depression, rather than 
some other psychological dimension related to depres- 
sion, is related to stroke. Cheerfulness, defined as the 
extreme low level of depressive symptoms, was not 
protective against stroke. We therefore conclude that a 
depressed mood places one at increased risk for stroke 
rather than that extreme cheerfulness places one at 
decreased risk. We also conclude that hopelessness, a 
component assessed by the GWB-D, places one at in- 



creased risk for stroke. Finally, the analysis of the 
GWB-D as a continuous scale demonstrated that in- 
creasing depressive symptomatology along a contin- 
uum was associated with increasing stroke incidence, 
not just at defined cutoffs. 
Well-validated self-reported depression scales such 
as the GWB-D have the advantage that an intermediate 
level of depression symptomatology can be estab- 
lished. Individuals in the present study with an inter- 
mediate level of depressive symptoms had a 20% to 
40% increased risk of stroke, which was suggestive of 
a risk gradient. Dimsdale (43) observed that subsyn- 
dromal depression can have significant health conse- 
quences. The high prevalence of intermediate depres- 
sion cases coupled with even marginally significant 
elevated relative risks suggests that even modest in- 
creases in risk for stroke in this group may have im- 
portant public health implications. 
The direct mechanisms underlying a depression- 
stroke connection are not well understood. Depression 
has been shown to result directly in acute autonomic 
arousal. Siever and Davis (44) hypothesized that affec- 
tive disorders are syndromes of neurotransmitter dys- 
regulation. They cite evidence that regulatory failure 
of the noradrenergic and related systems results in a 
loss of selectivity of responsiveness to environmental 
stimuli and in a delayed return to basal activity when 
stressful stimuli are withdrawn. Results of other stud- 
ies suggest 
that depression may increase stroke 
through increased adrenergic activity (44, 45) or 
through neuroendocrine and immunological effects 
(46 – 48). It has also been suggested that platelet acti- 
vation may be a factor explaining the depression- 
stroke connection (49, 50). 
It is also possible that depression operates indirectly 
by increasing the risk of other diseases that may in turn 
increase the risk of stroke. For example, Jonas et al. (5) 
found that persons with high depressive symptomatol- 
ogy had elevated risks for hypertension and that the 
pattern of elevated risks was higher for blacks. Other 
studies (51, 52) have demonstrated higher relative 
risks for hypertension among African Americans com- 
pared with whites. In the present study, race by itself 
was not significantly associated with increased stroke 
incidence in the overall risk-adjusted model; however, 
the pattern of elevated risks for depression and stroke 
were higher in the stratified models for blacks. Thus, 
intervening hypertension might explain, at least in 
part, the pathway from depression to stroke as well as 
the higher risk of stroke among depressed black per- 
sons. Anda et al. (6) also found an increased risk of 
ischemic heart disease among persons with high de- 
pressive symptomatology. Future research should ad- 
dress the potential pathway of depression, intervening 
hypertension, and cardiovascular disease and stroke. 
Our data show that other behavioral factors, consid- 
ered as potential confounders, do not attenuate the 
association between depression and stroke incidence. 
For example, although persons with a high level of 
depressive symptoms in our study were more likely to 
have low levels of nonrecreational physical activity, 
adjusting for this factor as well as other risk factors did 
not significantly change the observed association. 
However, these covariates may not have been suffi- 
ciently modeled. In particular, alcohol consumption in 
the past year was modeled dichotomously (none vs. 
any use) and thus may lack the sensitivity to fully 
detect variation in stroke incidence. Similarly, adjust- 
ing for preexisting heart disease or diabetes did not 
substantially alter the depression-stroke association. 
These conditions were generally significant covariates 
in our models. However, these baseline measures were 
self-reported and thus may not be as accurate as other 
measures, such as medical records from healthcare 
facilities. Furthermore, although the GWB-D is well 
validated, a score indicating a high level of depressive 
symptoms is not synonymous with a clinical diagnosis 
of depression. The prospective association between a 
clinical diagnosis of depression and stroke also needs 
to be studied. Confounding by variables not measured 
cannot be excluded. 
Other limitations of this study include possible bias 
due to cohort exclusions based on loss to follow-up 
(5.2%) or missing data on baseline risk factors (3.9%). 
However, because these exclusions were relatively 
small, we conclude that they should result in only 
minimal bias. In addition, inaccuracy of the baseline 
history of stroke could result in cases being identified 
during follow-up that were actually diagnosed before 
baseline. Another possible source of bias is misclassi- 
fication due to the inaccurate diagnoses coded on med- 
ical records and death certificates. Finally, the stroke 
identification approach taken in this study, which re- 
quired that a self-report of hospitalization for stroke be 
confirmed by a medical record listing stroke as a dis- 
charge diagnosis, could lead to incomplete case ascer- 
tainment. Self-reported stroke cases may exist without 
a matching medical record because no medical record 
was obtained or because the medical record contains a 
discharge diagnosis other than stroke. However, we 
found that the results were not affected by treating the 
unconfirmed stroke cases as true cases. 
Despite these limitations, this study provides addi- 
tional evidence that, among white men, white women, 
and all blacks aged 25 to 74 years, there is an associ- 
ation between self-reported depressive symptomatol- 
ogy and stroke incidence. An extended set of supple- 


mental analyses supported the robustness of 
the 
prospective association between depression and 
stroke. These analyses also demonstrated the consis- 
tency of this association across age groups and pro- 
vided evidence that depression itself, along with hope- 
lessness as a component of depression, was the 
operating psychological dimension prospectively as- 
sociated with stroke incidence. The suggestion of a 
graduated relationship between level of depressive 
symptoms and stroke indicates that reducing depres- 
sion may be important for everyone, not just those 
whose high symptomatology may have clinical impli- 
cations. Additional studies are needed to verify these 
findings and to elucidate the pathways for the effects 
of depression on stroke incidence.
