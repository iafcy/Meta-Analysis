A prospective cohort study over 7.5 years. 
Otsuki-town, Kochi prefecture, Japan. 
OBJECTIVES: 
To examine the influence of distinct clus- 
ters of psychiatric symptoms on subsequent cause-specific 
mortality in older persons living in the community. 
DESIGN: 
SETTING: 
PARTICIPANTS: 
ing persons, aged 65 to 84 in 1991. 
MEASUREMENTS: 
Psychiatric symptoms at baseline were 
measured using the 30-item version of the General Health 
Questionnaire (GHQ-30). A factor analysis was performed 
on the responses of all 980 subjects. The relationships be- 
tween subscale scores on the identified factors and causes 
of deaths occurring over 7.5 years in 817 respondents with 
no physical disability at baseline were assessed using a pro- 
portional hazards model adjusted for age, gender, chronic 
conditions under treatment, regular physical activity, and 
availability of close or casual neighbors. 
RESULTS: 
The factor analysis identified three clusters of 
psychiatric symptoms: depression, apathy/anergia, and anx- 
iety. In the proportional hazards model, which included 
three GHQ subscales depicting these factors simultaneously, 
the depression subscale was associated with increased mor- 
tality from cerebrovascular disease (multivariate adjusted 
hazard ratio per unit increase in the standard score on the 
depression subscale 
 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
(cid:2) 
 1.17–3.55), and the apathy/anergia subscale was associ- 
ated with increased mortality from noncancer and noncar- 
diovascular causes (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio per 
unit increase in the standard score on the apathy/anergia 
subscale 
 1.25–2.34). The anxiety sub- 
scale was not associated with any cause of death.

CONCLUSION: 
Depressive symptoms and symptoms in- 
dicating apathy/anergia have differential influences on sub- 
sequent causes of death in older persons living in the com- 
munity. Identification of specific psychiatric symptom clusters 
may contribute to the prevention of deaths from specific 
causes in older populations.

ental and emotional health are attracting attention 
as important factors in subsequent health problems 
in older persons living in communities. Depression, espe- 
cially, has been investigated in relation to overall mortality 
1–9 
and to mortality from and incidence of heart disease, 
cerebrovascular disease, 
5,10,11,13 
and the onset of physical disability. 
 With a few excep- 
tions, 
 a depressive symptom cluster, even when not 
meeting the criteria for a clinical depressive disorder, 
 is 
associated with adverse health consequences after adjust- 
ment for physical health status. 
 Some studies 
have reported that associations vary by gender, 
 physi- 
cal health status, 
10,11,15 
and cause of death. 











Information on the adverse effects of other types of psy- 
chopathology on health consequences for community-dwelling 
older persons is sparse. 
 Further studies should evaluate 
both the independent effects of different psychopathologies 
and their comorbidity with depression. Instruments measur- 
ing depression and other types of psychopathology are 
suited to the conduct of such studies. 

The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) is a 60-item 
instrument that measures four categories of psychological 
distress and behavior alteration: depression, anxiety, social 
impairment, and hypochondriasis (somatic symptoms). Two 
abbreviated versions of the GHQ, a 28-item version (the 
GHQ-28) and a 30-item version (the GHQ-30), have widely 
been used as instruments to screen for current and diag- 
nosable psychiatric disorders in community settings.

The GHQ-28 covers all four psychiatric symptom clusters 
assessed by the GHQ and has commonly been used to cre- 
ate four subscales corresponding to the respective ele- 
ments. However, difficulties in interpreting the somatic 
symptom clusters have been recognized, in that the same 
somatic symptoms can be present in a person with an en- 
tirely physical illness as in one with a psychopathology. 
Depressed persons may overemphasize somatic symptoms 
simply because of their excessive insight into depressive 
state. 
 The correct attribution of somatic symptoms to a 
physical illness as opposed to a depressive mood is diffi- 
cult. Interpretation of the second abbreviated version of 
the GHQ, the GHQ-30, is not plagued by this problem be- 
cause items relevant to somatic symptoms are excluded. 
Subscales reflecting purely psychiatric symptoms can be 
created from responses to the GHQ-30. 

The objective of the present study was to examine the 
relationships of distinct psychiatric symptom clusters with 
subsequent causes of death in older persons living in the 
community. Distinct psychiatric symptom clusters for com- 
munity-dwelling older persons in Japan were identified, us- 
ing the GHQ-30, and subscales depicting individual clusters 
were created. Their associations with specific causes of 
subsequent mortality were investigated in a 7.5-year pro- 
spective study. 


The present study was conducted in Otsuki-town, Kochi 
prefecture, which is located on the southwest coast of 
Shikoku Island, Japan. In this community of about 8,000 
residents, 23% of persons were aged 65 and older in 1990. 
A questionnaire survey on health status and lifestyle charac- 
teristics of all noninstitutionalized residents aged 65 to 84 
was conducted in February 1991. Of 1,494 residents meet- 
ing these requirements, 1,377 (92%) responded to the ques- 
tionnaire survey. Reasons for nonresponse included absence 
(cid:2) 
during the survey period (n 
 81). Of 
these 1,377 respondents, 980 completed the GHQ-30. 



Study Variables 
The Japanese version of the GHQ-30 
 formed the base- 
line survey. The respondents evaluated their experience of 
each of 30 psychiatric symptoms over the past few weeks 
on a 4-point scale: “0, not at all; 1, no more than usual; 2, 
rather more than usual; and 3, much more than usual.” 
Each symptom was scored according to the Likert scoring 
method for the response categories (0-1-2-3) to maximize 
the variability of the responses. 
Physical health status at baseline was assessed in terms 
of activities of daily living (ADL) impairment and self- 
reported chronic conditions under treatment. ADL impair- 
ment was evaluated according to whether help was needed 
on six items derived from the Older Americans Resources 
and Services methodology: 
 walking, bathing, going to 
23 
the toilet, dressing, grooming, and eating. Persons who 
needed help for at least one ADL item were regarded as 
impaired. Self-report of chronic conditions under treat- 
ment pertained to diseases of the circulatory system and 
included hypertension, heart disease, cerebrovascular dis- 
ease, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus. 
The lifestyle characteristics surveyed at baseline com- 
prised three health-related practices: smoking (present, 
past, and never), frequency of drinking (almost every day, 
sometimes, and never), and regular physical activity (per- 
forming spare-time physical activities regularly, taking the 
opportunity for increasing physical activity in the day time, 
and spending the daytime in a sedentary way) and three el- 
ements of social networks: marital status (married and not 
married), availability of close friends (having one or more 
close friends and having none), and availability of close or 
casual neighbors (having neighbors with whom one talks 
about personal matters, having casual neighbors to whom 
one says hello, and having neither type of neighbor). 
Follow-Up Status 
Of the 980 persons who completed the GHQ-30, 817 
were followed in the present analysis. Persons with ADL 
impairment (n 
 113) and with missing values on the co- 
variates used in the multivariate analysis (n 
 50) were ex- 
cluded. 


The follow-up status of respondents was determined 
by inspecting the municipal records of movement and 
deaths filed under the family registration act of Japan. Un- 
der the act, all residents are required to notify the munici- 
pality of moves and vital events. A death certificate accom- 
panies notifications of death. During the follow-up period 
of 7.5 years, from February 1991 to the end of August 
1998, 23 subjects moved from the area and 138 died. The 
underlying cause of death as given on the death certificate 
was coded according to the 
International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision 
 (ICD-9). After excluding two 
deaths from unknown causes, the numbers of deaths from 
specific causes were as follows: 20 deaths from cere- 
brovascular disease (ICD-9 codes 430–438); 26 deaths 
from heart disease (ICD-9 codes 390–392, 393–398, 401– 
405, 410–414, 415–429, 440–459); and 46 deaths from 
malignant neoplasms (ICD-9 codes 140–208). Of the re- 
maining 44 deaths, 10 were from pneumonia and influ- 
enza (ICD-9 codes 480–486, 487), nine from accidents 
and injuries (ICD-9 codes 800–999), and 25 from all other 
causes. These 44 deaths were combined as noncardiovas- 
cular and noncancer causes. 
Statistical Analysis 
A factor analysis with a varimax rotation was performed 
on the responses of the 980 persons who completed the 
GHQ-30. Initial factors were extracted using the principal 
components analysis, and a varimax rotation was per- 
formed on the initial factor solution. The resulting factor 
structure was interpreted, making reference to previous 
studies on factor structure of the GHQ-30 in community 
settings. 
 In accordance with previously employed crite- 
ria, 
 an item was defined as loading on a given factor if 
28 
the factor loading was 0.5 or greater for that factor and 
less than 0.5 for other factors. A subscale for each GHQ 
factor was created by summing subject responses to the 
items that had loadings of 0.5 or greater on the corre- 
sponding factor. The score on each subscale was trans- 
formed as a standard score with mean and standard devia- 
tion for the 980 respondents. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 




To test for differences between the categories of the di- 
chotomized study variables in the age- and gender-adjusted 
mean scores on the individual GHQ subscales, an analysis 
of covariance was performed. 
A proportional hazards model was used to assess the 
association of each GHQ subscale with subsequent mor- 
tality for the 817 persons who had had no ADL impair- 
ment. The proportional hazards assumption for each GHQ 
subscale was checked using a model that included an inter- 
action term between time and the score on the subscale. 
No GHQ subscale violated the assumptions in predicting 
all-cause or cause-specific mortality. 




Analyses using a continuous measure of psychopa- 
thology may fail to ascertain an association between the 
psychopathology and subsequent mortality if the relation- 
ship is nonlinear. 
 Therefore, standard scores for individ- 
ual GHQ subscales were tested in continuous and dichoto- 
mous versions ( 
1). Two models were fitted for 
each approach; one tested each of the three GHQ sub- 
scales separately and the other the three GHQ subscales si- 
multaneously. In the latter case, the association of each 
GHQ factor with mortality was examined after adjust- 
ment for comorbidity of the other GHQ factors. In the 
analyses of cause-specific mortality, separate models were 
fitted for each cause of death, and persons who had died 
from other causes were treated as censored at the time of 
dying. In all models, the covariates of age, gender, chronic 
conditions under treatment, and lifestyle characteristics 
were adjusted for. The statistical analyses were performed 
using SPSS 10.0J for Windows. 

RESULTS 
The mean age 
 standard deviation at baseline of the sub- 
jects used in the factor analysis (n 
 5.4. 
Sixty-one percent were women, and 89% had no impair- 
ment on the six ADL items at that time. 



As shown in Table 1, factor analysis with a varimax 
rotation identified five factors with eigenvalues exceeding 
unity. The five factors accounted for 53.9% of the total 
variance, whereas the first three factors accounted for 
40.5%. Six items (items 19, 23, 24, 25, 29, 30) of the 
seven that loaded only on the first factor were interpreted 
as depression. All seven items (items 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) that 
loaded on the second factor were related to apathy and an- 
ergia (lack of energy). Two items relating to sleep distur- 
bance (items 2, 5) and four items relating to anxiety (items 
14, 15, 18, 21) defined the third factor. The combinations 
of items with loadings of 0.5 or greater on these three fac- 
tors were similar to findings in other populations 
 and 
were labeled depression, apathy/anergia, and anxiety, re- 
spectively, for the purposes of this study. The fourth and 
the fifth factors were not interpreted, because the percent- 
age of variance that each accounted for was relatively 
small ( 
8%), and only two or three items in each had 
loadings of 0.5 or greater. 


Table 3 describes differences at baseline in the GHQ 
subscale scores between categories of age, gender, physical 
health status, and lifestyle characteristics. Scores on the 
depression and apathy/anergia subscales were higher in 
the older age group, and those on the depression and the 
anxiety subscales were higher in women. For five of the six 
cells resulting from the three GHQ subscales and two 
physical health variables, age- and gender-adjusted mean 
scores on the GHQ subscales were higher for persons with 
physical health impairment. The exception of no differ- 
ence occurred for depression scores in relation to number 
of chronic conditions. For lifestyle characteristics, age- 
and gender-adjusted mean scores on the GHQ subscales 
were higher in persons not performing regular physical ac- 
tivity and in those having no close or casual neighbors. 
The two lifestyle characteristics were treated as potentially 
confounding variables in the survival analysis. 
Table 4 shows the relationships between the individual 
GHQ subscales and subsequent all-cause and cause-specific 
mortality. Although the hazard ratios associated with the 
dichotomized subscales are higher than those associated 
with the continuous subscales, the two approaches give the 
same pattern of results. Therefore, only the results of the 
analysis using continuous subscales are described below. 
When the individual GHQ subscales were examined 
separately, depression and apathy/anergia were found to 
be predictive of subsequent all-cause mortality, but, when 
all three GHQ subscales were included simultaneously, 
neither of these factors was associated with all-cause mor- 
tality. In the investigation of cause-specific mortality, in 
which the three GHQ subscales were included simulta- 
neously, depression was found to be associated with an in- 
creased risk of cerebrovascular disease mortality (multi- 
variate adjusted hazard ratio per unit increase in the 
(cid:2) 
depression subscale 
1.17–3.55), and apathy/anergia was found to be associ- 
ated with an excess risk of dying from noncardiovascular 
and noncancer causes (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio 
per unit increase in the apathy/anergia subscale 
 1.71, 
95% CI 
 1.25–2.34). No significant association was 
found between anxiety and mortality in the model that in- 
cluded all three GHQ subscales simultaneously. 




The interactions of each of the GHQ subscales with 
age and gender were examined with respect to all-cause 
and cause-specific mortality. The only statistically signifi- 
cant interaction that occurred was between depression and 
gender, with regard to heart disease mortality ( 
 .005). To 
investigate this interaction further, gender-specific models 
using the depression subscale only were fitted for predic- 
tion of heart disease mortality. As seen in Table 5, depres- 
sion was significantly associated with the risk of dying 
from heart disease in women only (multivariate adjusted 
hazard ratio per unit increase in the depression subscale in 
women 




 


Table 2 presents descriptive and internal consistency 
statistics for the subscales corresponding to the three fac- 
tors described. Item 22, which had loadings of 0.5 or 
greater on both the depression and the anxiety factor, was 
excluded when creating those two subscales. All reliability 
estimates (Cronbach’s coefficient alpha) for the three sub- 
scales exceeded 0.8 and were acceptable. 
DISCUSSION 
The burden of GHQ-derived psychiatric symptom clusters 
was found to be associated with subsequent mortality 
among community-dwelling older persons. These associa- 
tions were observed in persons with no physical disability 
and could not be explained by comorbid physical illness.

The reasons for excluding persons with ADL impair- 
ment should be clarified. Antecedent psychopathology is 
an independent predictor of physical disability, 
 and 
thus physical disability may represent an intermediate step 
in the causal pathway between a psychiatric symptom 
cluster and mortality in older populations. Therefore, con- 
trol of physical disability as a confounding factor reduces 
 and 
the variability of the psychiatric symptom cluster 
underestimates the association of interest. By choosing 
subjects with no ADL impairment, the problem of overad- 


justment for physical disability can be avoided. In the 
present analysis, the number of chronic conditions under 
treatment was treated as a variable of physical health sta- 
tus that might confound the association of interest. 
This study has several limitations. First, the findings 
could be biased because only persons who could complete 
the GHQ-30 were admitted as subjects. Of the 397 per- 
sons who were excluded from the present analysis because 
of incomplete responses to the GHQ-30, 302 had no ADL 
impairment. Compared with persons who were used in the

 817), they were older (mean age 
survival analysis (n 
73.1 vs 71.8; two-sample 
 test, equality of variances as- 
sumed, 
 .002). There was no difference in the propor- 
tions of women and, of those with chronic conditions un- 
der treatment, between the two groups. If the persons 
excluded from the analysis had higher levels of psychiatric 
symptoms, associated with older age, then the present 
findings would underestimate the effect of the burden of 
psychiatric symptom clusters on subsequent mortality. 

 
Second, the GHQ might fail to identify some persons 
with chronic psychiatric symptoms in the target popula- 
tion. Because the response categories of the GHQ required 
assessment of whether each symptom was “worse than 
usual,” this instrument might not identify the symptom in 
a person who had suffered it over a long period and had 
come to consider it usual. 
 The associations observed in 
the present study might, therefore, reflect only the effects 
of acute psychiatric symptoms. 

Third, the loss of significant associations between the 
individual GHQ subscale scores and all-cause mortality, 
when all three GHQ subscales were included simulta- 
neously, might indicate that the depression and the apa- 
thy/anergia subscales were not truly independent of each 
other but shared a variance that was the real correlate of 
all-cause mortality, this latent variance being imperfectly 
captured by either of the subscales. Alternatively, an inde- 
pendent influence of the GHQ subscales on specific causes 
of death might be diluted in the analysis for all-cause mor- 
tality, where relationships with insignificant causes of death 
were included.

Fourth, the subscales of the GHQ-30 have not been val- 
idated against a clinical diagnosis. The persons with higher 
scores on the subscales might include those who do not fit 
clinical criteria for psychiatric disorders. Depressive symp- 
toms not meeting the criteria for clinical depressive disorders 
have been found to explain the discrepancy between a high 
prevalence of depressive symptoms and a low prevalence of 
clinically diagnosable depressive disorders in community 
populations.33 Such symptoms have been identified as inde- 
pendent predictors of adverse health consequences.6,34,35 A 
similar situation may exist for other clusters of psychiatric 
symptoms not meeting the criteria for clinical disorders but 
relevant to subsequent health events and should be explored. 
Finally, the presence of persons with occult or unre- 
ported physical illnesses at baseline might have a residual 
confounding effect on the association of psychiatric symp- 
toms with mortality. However, in the present study, the re- 
sidual confounding effect seemed to be small. An analysis 
excluding the 10 persons who had died within 1 year of 
the baseline survey did not alter the findings.

The specific relationships between distinct psychiatric 
symptom clusters and subsequent causes of death are wor- 
thy of notice. In the present study, depressive symptoms at 
baseline were associated with an increased risk of cere- 
brovascular disease mortality after adjustment for gender. 
This finding is consistent with the association between 
higher levels of depressive symptoms and increased risk of 
mortality from stroke in a 29-year prospective study of 
community-dwelling adults (mean age at baseline, 43 
years) in Alameda County, the United States.36 However, 
findings of prospective studies have been inconsistent for 
older populations with regard to the association between 
depression and cerebrovascular disease. The Established 
Population for the Epidemiologic Study for the Elderly 
(EPESE) in the United States, at its New Haven site, using 
all participants, found no relationship between initial scores 
on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale 
(CES-D) and stroke incidence across 7 years, after adjust- 
ment for gender and other potential confounding factors.13 
However, the depression score was associated with an in- 
creased incidence of stroke over 6 years, in both genders, 
when subjects were restricted to those with diagnosed hy- 
pertension.5 At two other sites of the EPESE, the associa- 
tion between scores on the CES-D and stroke incidence 
was examined, by gender, in those with diagnosed hyper- 
tension, and a significant association was observed among 
men in East Boston but not in Iowa.5 
As in the present study, subsequent increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease has been found to be associated 
with initial depressive symptom clusters in women only. 
At the New Haven site of the EPESE, a 9-year prospective 
study using all participants found an association between 
scores on the CES-D and coronary heart disease mortality 
in women with no physical disability.12 In a 6-year pro- 
spective study, at three sites of the EPESE, which restricted 
subjects to those with diagnosed hypertension, an associa- 
tion was found for women at two of the three sites (New 
Haven and Iowa).5 
By contrast, no epidemiological study has examined 
the relationship, found here, between a symptom cluster 
indicating apathy/anergia and the risk of dying from non- 
cancer and noncardiovascular causes. 
Depressive symptoms and apathy/anergia do not nec- 
essarily imply an affective disorder, and other explanations 
for the observed association between psychiatric symptom 
clusters and mortality need to be explored. For example, 
mood disturbance, fatigue, cognitive slowing, and anergia 
are associated with certain cytokines, notably (cid:7)-inter- 
feron.37,38 The neuropsychiatric changes associated with (cid:7)- 
interferon are thought to reflect a disturbance in frontal 
lobe function39,40 and may be mediated by neuroendocrine, 
neurotransmitter, or cytokine effects.38,41 The neuroendo- 
crine effects of (cid:7)-interferon include disorders of thyroid 
function and stimulation of the adrenocorticotropic hor- 
mone/cortisol axis. The neurotransmitter effects of (cid:7)-inter- 
feron include opioid-dopamine changes (underactivity of en- 
dogenous opioid systems, acting as a dopamine antagonist), 
serotonin depletion, and norepinephrine increases. Seroto- 
nin depletion is strongly associated with depressive symp- 
toms. The cytokine effects of (cid:7)-interferon include the sec- 
ondary production of proinflammatory cytokines such as 
interleukin-6. Interleukin-6 has widespread neuroendocrine 
effects. It may affect the metabolism of lipoproteins and 
cause hypocholesterolemia,42 which is thought to be associ- 
ated with deaths due to noncardiovascular and noncancer 
causes.43 
In their aggregate, the pathways evoked by (cid:7)-interferon 
could be capable of contributing directly and indirectly to the 
development of, and the excess disability associated with, 
cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease.44 Thus, the 
“depressive” symptoms and apathy/anergia observed here 
could be either the direct result of underlying neuroendocrine 
or neuroimmunological responses to concurrent medical ill- 
nesses or a symptom of processes that affect the course of 
some illnesses. Neuroendocrine and neuroimmunological 
changes associated with medical illnesses should also be in- 
vestigated in further studies on the relationship between psy- 
chiatric symptoms and subsequent health events. 
The present study indicates that two of the three dis- 
tinct psychiatric symptom clusters identified by the GHQ- 
30 have differential influences on subsequent causes of 
death in community-dwelling older persons. Persons with 
depressive symptoms and those with symptoms indicating 
apathy/anergia are at increased risk of death from differ- 
ing causes. In Japan, public health services aimed at pri- 
mary and secondary prevention of chronic diseases are 
provided at the municipality level for community-dwelling 
older persons, but psychiatric symptoms as influences on 
subsequent health events have not been well recognized in 
the preventive health services. Addressing the burden of 
psychiatric symptom clusters, even when they do not meet 
the criteria of clinically diagnosable disorders, could con- 
tribute to the prevention of mortality from specific causes.
