Background and Purpose—Depression has been associated with increased risk of coronary 
heart disease, but prospective data for the association with stroke are limited. 
Methods—We followed 80,574 women aged 54 to 79 years in Nurses’ Health Study without a 
prior history of stroke from 2000 to 2006. Depressive symptoms were assessed at multiple time- 
points by a Mental Health Index (MHI-5) score (1992, 1996 and 2000), and clinical significant 
depressive symptoms were defined as a score ≤52. Antidepressant medication (ADM) use was 
asked biennially beginning in 1996, and physician-diagnosed depression was reported biennially 
beginning in 2000. Depression was defined as currently reporting or having a history of any of 
these three conditions. 
Results—During 6 years of follow-up, 1,033 incident strokes were documented (538 ischemic, 
124 hemorrhagic, and 371 unknown strokes). Having a history of depression was associated with a 
multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio of 1.29 (95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.48) for total stroke. 
Women who used ADMs were at increased risks of stroke, whether they also had a MHI-5 score 
≤52 or diagnosed depression (1.39; 1.15–1.69), or not (1.31; 1.03–1.67). Furthermore, for each 
cycle, participants who reported current depression had an increased risk of stroke (1.41; 1.18– 
1.67), whereas individuals who only had a past history of depression were at a non-significantly 
elevated risk (1.23; 0.97–1.56), compared with women who never reported a diagnosis of 
depression or ADM use. 
Conclusions—Our results suggest that depression is associated with a moderately increased risk 
of subsequent stroke.

Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States, and nonfatal stroke is a 
leading cause of permanent disability and economic loss as a result of impairment.1 Late-life 
depression may be a marker of sub-clinical cerebrovascular disease,2 indicating increased 
stroke risk. Depression may also influence stroke risk via neuroendocrine, immunological 
and inflammatory effects.3,4 Several prospective studies investigating the association 
between depression and incident stroke have been conducted; however, studies using 
clinically-diagnosed depression as the predictor have yielded mixed results.5–9 Few studies 
have been conducted specifically among middle-aged and elderly women,10 in whom the 
prevalence of depression is high,11 and the risk of stroke is substantial.12 
We previously found that depression was associated with increased risk of sudden death and 
fatal coronary heart disease (CHD).13 In the present study, we aimed to examine the 
association between depression and incident stroke among middle-aged and elderly women 
of the Nurses’ Health Study during 6 years of follow-up. We also examined the association 
of antidepressant medication (ADM) use with stroke risk, because a recent report suggested 
an increased risk of subsequent stroke with use of these medications.14 


The Nurses’ Health Study cohort was established in 1976 when 121,700 female registered 
nurses aged 30–55 years residing in 11 states responded to a mailed questionnaire regarding 
their medical history and health practices. Follow-up questionnaires were administered 
biennially after baseline, to update information on lifestyle practice and occurrence of 
chronic diseases.10,15 Follow-up rates through 2006 exceeded 94%. The study protocol was 
approved by the institutional review boards of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard 
School of Public Health. 
We used the 2000 questionnaire cycle as the baseline since explicit ascertainment of 
physician-diagnosed depression began in this year (n=94,791). We excluded participants 
without information on depressive symptoms, depression diagnosis or ADM use (n=12,463), 
those with prior stroke (n=1,651) and missing values for covariates (n=103) at baseline. 
Finally, 80,574 participants were included. Compared to women included in the current 
analysis, excluded participants had similar ages and incidence rates of stroke, but higher 
BMI and slightly higher prevalence rates of hypertension, diabetes and heart disease (data 
not shown). 

Depressive symptoms were assessed in 1992, 1996 and 2000 with the five-item Mental 
Health Index (MHI-5), a subscale of the Short-Form 36 Health Status Survey. The 
participants were asked how much of the time over the past month (all, most, good bit, 
some, little, or none) they 1) felt nervous, 2) felt so down that nothing could cheer them up, 
3) felt calm and peaceful, 4) felt down and blue, or 5) felt happy. Scores are re-scaled from 0 
to 100, with lower scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms.16 The MHI-5 has 
been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity for major depression,17 and it was 
considered as a dichotomous variable for the presence (MHI-5≤52) or absence (MHI-5 >52) 
of significant depressive symptoms for each time it was queried.18 
Participants were first asked to report regular use of ADM in 1996, while types of ADMs 
were first ascertained on the 2000 questionnaire, when participants were specifically asked 
about their regular use during the past 2 years of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 



(SSRIs, including fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram), or other antidepressants, of 
which the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) amitriptyline, imipramine, and nortriptyline were 
provided as examples. In 2000, the nurses were first asked whether they ever had a lifetime 
physician diagnosis of depression (1996 or before, 1997–1998, 1999, on or after 2000); the 
information on ADM and physician-diagnosed depression was updated biennially thereafter. 

During 6 years of follow-up, 1,237 women in the study population self-reported a stroke. In 
addition, 221 fatal strokes were ascertained by next of kin, postal authorities, or the National 
Death Index. Medical records, autopsy reports, or death certificates were sought for all 
reported strokes, and 886 were received and reviewed by a study physician, of which 648 
were confirmed. Of the 572 reported strokes for which a medical record or death certificate 
was unavailable, 385 cases were confirmed by the participants or next of kin, and these were 
designated probable stroke. Therefore, our current analysis included 1033 confirmed 
(n=648) and probable (n=385) stroke cases. 
Strokes were confirmed using the National Survey of Stroke criteria,19 requiring 
neurological deficit of rapid or sudden onset lasting ≥24 hours or until death. Physicians 
blinded to risk factor status reviewed the medical records. Cerebrovascular pathology due to 
infection, trauma, or malignancy was excluded, as were “silent” strokes discovered only by 
radiologic imaging We categorized types of stroke as ischemic (embolic or thrombotic), 
hemorrhagic (subarachnoid or intracerebral), and unknown, based on imaging and clinical 
data.19 Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging reports were available for 
95% of those with medical records. A validation study in this cohort demonstrated high 
reliability and validity of the stroke classification.20 In a sensitivity analysis, the exclusion 
of probable strokes did not alter the results; therefore, we included both confirmed and 
probable strokes in this analysis. 
In the biennial follow-up questionnaires, we inquired and updated demographic and lifestyle 
behavior information, including body weight, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, 
physical activity, menopausal status, hormone therapy use, current aspirin and multivitamin 
uses, marital status, ethnicity, and parental history of myocardial infarction (MI). Dietary 
information was assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, and a 
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score was used to characterize their 
usual diet pattern. In addition, respondents were asked to report previously diagnosed 
medical conditions, e.g., diabetes, hypertension, elevated cholesterol, heart disease 
(including MI, angina, and coronary artery revascularization) and cancer. 


As described above, the three measures of depression status were queried at different time- 
points; however, all were available in 2000. Because it can be difficult to determine when a 
particular episode of depression started or ended, our primary analysis defined depression as 
currently reporting or having a history of any of the three conditions: physician-diagnosed 
depression, regular use of ADMs, or MHI-5 ≤52.15 Depressed participants were further 
divided into three groups: MHI-5 ≤52 or physician-diagnosed depression without ADM use; 
MHI-5 ≤52 or physician-diagnosed depression with ADM use; MHI-5 >52 and no 
physician-diagnosed depression, but with ADM use. This classification was based on prior 
knowledge that ADM might increase stroke risk via mechanisms different from depression 
itself. Dummy variables were created for each category to compare with the reference group 
of no depression. In a separate analysis, we classified women into never, past, and current 
depression according to their clinical depression status at each two-year questionnaire 




period. Since the MHI-5 score was not updated during 2000–2006, clinical depression 
(having a physician-diagnosed depression, regular ADM use, or both) was used in this 
specific analysis. In each analysis, the associations of depression with types of stroke 
(ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke) were also examined. 
Individuals contributed person-time from the return of the 2000 baseline questionnaire until 
the date of stroke, death, June 30th 2006, or the date of return of their last questionnaires, 
whichever came first. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used, and 
depression and most of the covariates were updated every 2 years except ethnicity and 
parental history of myocardial infarction. We controlled for age (continuous), marital status 
(currently having spouse or not), parental history of myocardial infarction (yes/no), ethnicity 
(whites/non-whites), menopausal status (premenopausal or postmenopausal) and 
postmenopausal hormone use (never, past or current use), current aspirin use (yes/no), 
current multivitamin use (yes/no), body mass index (<23.0, 23.0–24.9, 25.0–29.9, 30.0– 
34.9, ≥35.0 kg/m2), smoking status (never, past, or current smoking of 1–14, 15–24, or ≥25 
cigarettes/d), alcohol intake (0, 0.1–4.9, 5.0–14.9, ≥15 g/d), physical activity (<3, 3–8.9, 9– 
17.9, 18–26.9, ≥27 metabolic equivalent-hours/week), and quintile of Dietary Approaches to 
Stop Hypertension dietary score. Histories of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, 
cancer and heart diseases (yes/no) were further included in the final model. Data were 
analyzed with the Statistical Analysis Systems software package, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, 
Inc., Cary, North Carolina). 
The mean age of the participants was 66 years (range: 54–79) in 2000. The reported 
prevalence of depression was 22.3% in 2000. Compared to participants without a history of 
depression, depressed women were younger, more likely to be single, had a higher BMI and 
smoke cigarettes, and less likely to be physically active (Table 1). The prevalence of major 
comorbidities was also higher in depressed women. 
During 6 years of follow-up, 1,033 incident strokes were documented (538 ischemic, 124 
hemorrhagic, and 371 unknown types of strokes). In age-adjusted analyses, depression was 
associated to an increased risk of total stroke with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.49 (95% CI, 
1.30–1.70; Table 2). The HR was attenuated but remained significant after controlling for 
various covariates including major comorbidities (1.29; 1.13–1.48). Results were not 
significant for either hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke separately, possibly due to lower 
power. No significant interactions between depression, age and major comorbidities with 
total stroke risk were found (Supplemental Table 1). 
Increased risk of stroke was seen among women who used ADM, with (1.39; 1.15–1.69) or 
without (1.31; 1.03–1.67) a MHI-5 score ≤52 or diagnosed depression, compared with non- 
depressed women (Table 2). Furthermore, compared with women without a history of 
clinical depression (having a physician-diagnosed depression, regular ADM use, or both), 
women with a past history of clinical depression had a non-significantly elevated risk (1.23; 
0.97–1.56), while those currently reporting clinical depression for the particular two-year 
questionnaire period had a significantly increased risk (1.41; 1.18–1.67; Table 3). Finally, 
women who used ADMs were at increased risks of stroke (1.30; 1.08–1.55; Supplemental 
Table 2). The risk was significant for SSRIs (1.39; 1.13–1.72), the largest use category, but 
not for other ADMs (1.14; 0.82–1.58). 




The findings from this well-characterized cohort of more than 80,000 US women with a 6- 
year follow-up add to the growing evidence that depression is associated with stroke risk. 
Additionally, our data suggest that women currently reporting clinical depression have an 
increased stroke risk. Finally, ADM use (particularly SSRIs) was associated with an 
increased stroke risk. 
Relatively few prospective studies have examined depression as a risk factor for stroke, even 
though depression has been consistently identified as a significant risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease.3 Our prior publication in the same cohort found that depressive 
symptoms (measured by MHI-5) were associated with increased risk of fatal CHD, and 
ADM use was associated with significantly increased risk of sudden cardiac death.13 Our 
current results suggest that depression is also a significant risk factor for stroke. The present 
study is consistent with two previous cohort studies.5,21 Larson et al.5 found a 2.7-fold 
increased risk of incident stroke associated with baseline depression status (determined by 
the Diagnostic Interview Schedule) among 1,703 adults during a 13-year follow-up. 
Similarly, Liebetrau et al.21 found a positive association in 401 participants aged 85 years 
old during a 3-year follow-up. However, both studies were limited by small numbers of 
stroke outcomes. In contrast, Surtees et al.9 observed no association between baseline major 
depression and stroke risk in 20,627 European participants aged 41–80 years during 8.5 
years of follow-up. Nevertheless, a 2007 meta-analysis pooled results from both case-control 
and cohort studies and estimated that depressed mood was associated with an RR of 1.43 
(95% CI, 1.17–1.75) for stroke.22 Recently, O’Donnell and the INTERSTROKE 
investigators23 found that self-reported depressive symptoms (for 2 or more weeks in the 
last year) were associated with a 35% increased odds of stroke in over 3000 cases and 3000 
matched controls from 22 countries. 
ADM use has recently attracted much attention due to its reported potential associations 
with increased risks of CHD13 and stroke.14,24 ADM use has been associated with weight 
gain,25 increased inflammation,26 abnormal bleeding,27 and hypertension;28 thus, it may 
increase risk of stroke. In our study, participants who used ADMs had an increased risk, 
with a 39% increased risk for total stroke with SSRIs, which is highly similar to the results 
from the Women’s Health Initiative (1.45; 1.08–1.97).14 A large case-control study also 
found a 20–40% increased risk of stroke associated with ADMs.24 However, null 
associations also have been reported.29–30 ADM use may be a marker of depression severity, 
rather than a causal mechanism. The results were not changed when we adjusted for 
depressive symptoms score in our cohort (data not shown); however, residual confounding 
may exist. Additionally, ADMs are also used for other conditions (e.g., anxiety disorders, 
insomnia, and neuropathic pain), and the indication for use was not available in our study. 
Additional studies of large sample sizes and with information on dose and duration are 
needed to investigate the effects of ADMs on cardiovascular outcomes including stroke. 
Depression may be associated with an increased risk of stroke through a variety of 
mechanisms. Depression has known neuroendocrine (sympathetic nervous system 
activation, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, platelet 
aggregation dysfunction, etc.)3 and immunological/inflammatory effects,4 which could 
influence stroke risk. Late-life depression may represent a manifestation of sub-clinical 
vascular disease.2 Depression may be associated with poor health behaviors (i.e., smoking, 
physical inactivity, poor diet, lack of medication compliance),31 obesity32 and other major 
comorbidities,33 which might increase stroke risk. However, whatever the mechanism, 
recognizing that depressed women may be at a higher risk of stroke merits additional 
research into preventive strategies in this group. 



The present study has key strengths. Biennially repeated assessments of risk factors and 
disease outcomes were utilized, and time-dependent Cox models were utilized. Furthermore, 
three different sources of information (MHI-5, ADM use, and physician-diagnosed 
depression) were used to determine depression status. This study also has several 
limitations. First, the sample was a relatively homogeneous population of predominantly 
white registered nurse, which may limit generalizability to other populations. Potential 
selection bias is possible because we had to exclude a large proportion of women without 
detailed information on depression measures and participants with early onset stroke. In 
addition, information on physician-diagnosed depression and ADM use was self-reported, 
and the depressive symptoms questionnaire was not updated during the follow-up; therefore, 
the prevalence of depression might be underestimated. Nevertheless, the lifetime prevalence 
of depression at baseline in our study (22.3%) is consistent with that expected for women of 
this age group.7,34 Moreover, we could not distinguish between chronic and recurrent 
courses of depression due to limited information. Lastly, we cannot infer causation, or fully 
exclude the possibility that the results could be explained by other unmeasured or unknown 
potentially related factors (e.g., anxiety, dispositional optimism and/or hostility). 

These data provide additional evidence that depression is associated with a moderately 
increased risk of incident stroke. The association between current depression status, 
antidepressant medication use and risk of stroke deserves further scrutiny. Further research 
is necessary to determine whether the risk associated with depression can be reduced by 
other therapies or preventive strategies.
