OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mediator role of inﬂam- 
mation in any relationship between depressive symptoms 
and ischemic stroke. 
DESIGN: Longitudinal prospective study. 
SETTING: Review of medical records, death certiﬁcates, 
and the Medicare healthcare utilization database for hos- 
pitalizations. 
PARTICIPANTS: Total of 5,525 elderly men and women 
aged 65 and older who were prospectively followed from 
1989 to 2000 as participants in the Cardiovascular Health 
Study. 
MEASUREMENTS: Depression symptom scores, inﬂam- 
matory markers. 
RESULTS: Greater depressive symptoms were associated 
with risk of ischemic stroke (unadjusted hazard ratio 
(HR) 5 1.32, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 5 1.09–1.59; 
HR 5 1.26, 95% CI 5 1.03–1.54, adjusted for traditional 
risk factors). When a term for inﬂammation (C-reactive 
protein (CRP)) was introduced in the model, the HRs were 
not appreciably altered (unadjusted HR 5 1.31, 95% 
CI 5 1.08–1.58; adjusted HR 5 1.25, 95% CI 5 1.02– 
1.53), indicating that CRP at baseline was not a mediator 
in this relationship. In analyses stratiﬁed according to CRP 
levels, a J-shaped relationship between depressive symp- 
toms and stroke was evident in the unadjusted analyses; in 
the fully adjusted model, only CRP in the highest tertile was 
associated with a higher risk for stroke in the presence of 
higher depressive symptoms scores. 
CONCLUSION: The analyses from this prospective study 
provide evidence of a positive association between depres- 
sive symptoms and risk of incident stroke. Inﬂammation, as

ciation between depressive symptoms and stroke.1–8 All 
of these have been longitudinal studies that have controlled 
for most of the commonly accepted stroke etiological fac- 
tors. Although the relationship between depression and 
cerebrovascular disease events has been consistent, current 
understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains spec- 
ulative. It has been hypothesized that inﬂammation could 
be one of the mechanisms by which depression increases 
risk for ischemic stroke. Inﬂammatory factors have been 
linked to stroke.9–11 For example, one study found a rel- 
ative risk of 1.2 (95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 5 1.01–1.54) 
in men and 1.3 (95% CI 5 1.07–1.55) in women for stroke 
in subjects with high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) after 
adjusting for common stroke risk factors. 9 Another study 
found that CRP was an independent risk factor for stroke 
and that carotid intima-media thickness did not appear to 
act as the mediator.11 Recently, inﬂammation has also been 
linked to depression. A third study showed that elevated 
CRP, ﬁbrinogen, and factor VIIc were associated with de- 
pression in older adults, although it found that exhaustion 
and fatigue had a stronger association with CRP than 
depression.12 In young adult men included in the Third 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey sam- 
ple, CRP was associated with current depression even after 
adjustment for body mass index (BMI), smoking, and 
health status. Men whose depression had resolved had al- 
most the same prevalence of high CRP as those who had 
never experienced a major depressive episode.13 
A systematic review and meta-analysis reported that 
CRP was associated with risk of stroke and cognitive 
impairment, but the relationship between CRP and depres- 
sion was not consistent. Most of these studies have been 
cross-sectional, and the causal pathway between CRP and

depression may be bidirectional. One conclusion was that 
future prospective studies designed to elucidate these asso- 
ciations are warranted.14 
Current understanding of the underlying mechanisms 
by which depression increases the risk of stroke remains 
uncertain. This study examined prospectively the relation- 
ship between depressive symptoms and ischemic stroke us- 
ing data from a large community-based cohort of older 
adults. The extent to which inﬂammation acts as a mediator 
for the relationship between depressive symptoms and 
stroke was assessed. Because depressive symptoms and in- 
ﬂammation may act synergistically to increase risk of 
stroke, whether the relationship between depressive symp- 
toms and stroke differs according to level of inﬂammation 
was also examined. If inﬂammation was the primary path- 
way by which depression leads to stroke, preventive inter- 
ventions could be targeted to normalizing inﬂammation. 

Description of Population 
The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a longitudinal, 
observational study of men and women aged 65 and older 
designed to investigate risk factors for cardiovascular dis- 
ease.15 The main outcome measures in the CHS were cor- 
onary heart disease (CHD), peripheral vascular disease, and 
stroke. In the CHS, a total of 5,888 participants from a 
sample of Medicare-eligible individuals residing in one of 
four communities (Sacramento County, California; Wash- 
ington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; 
and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) were enrolled in two phases. 
In the initial recruiting phase, 5,201 participants were en- 
rolled between 1989 and 1991. A second enrollment of 687 
African-American participants was completed between 
1992 and 1993. The exclusion criteria for the CHS 
included hospice treatment, being wheelchair bound in the 
home, and undergoing radiation or chemotherapy for cancer. 
Additionally, for this analysis, all participants in whom 
record review conﬁrmed self-reported history of stroke were 
included. The institutional review boards at each participat- 
ing institution approved the research protocols. 
Data Collection 
Depressive Symptoms 
Information on depressive symptoms was based on ques- 
tionnaire-derived data collected by trained interviewers in 
the CHS at baseline (1989–1991). Depressive symptoms 
were evaluated using the Center for Epidemiological Stud- 
ies Depression Scale (CES-D).16 A modiﬁed version of the 
CES-D with only 10-items was used in the CHS study.17 The 
CES-D assesses frequency of depressive symptoms experi- 
enced in the previous week. The items are scored on a 4- 
point (0 5 rarely to 3 5 always) scale, and individual item 
scores are totaled to yield a summary score. Higher scores 
indicate more depressive symptoms. The traditional score 
(48) on the 10-item CES-D, which has been considered to 
indicate ‘‘high likelihood of clinical depression,’’ was used. 
This scale is reliable, and other investigators have validated 
it.18 Its psychometric properties include a sensitivity of 90% 
and a speciﬁcity of 72% for major depression.19 
Inﬂammatory Markers 
Blood was drawn in the morning after an overnight fast. 
Samples were promptly centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min- 
utes at (cid:1) 701C. CRP was measured in 1997 on all stored 
baseline plasma samples using a high-sensitivity immuno- 
assay with an interassay coefﬁcient of variation of 6.25%. 
CRP levels at baseline were available as a continuous vari- 
able and were categorized into tertiles for the analyses. 
Other Covariates 
Information on sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, 
race, education, income, occupation, marital status) and 
self-report of chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes mel- 
litus, and coronary heart disease) were collected at baseline. 
Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were 
also recorded at baseline. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) 
per height (m) squared. Trained personnel measured blood 
pressure. The mean of two readings was used for this anal- 
ysis. Hypertension was deﬁned as a previous diagnosis of 
hypertension, taking antihypertensive medication, or hav- 
ing a current systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher 
or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. Persons 
were considered diabetic if they had a medical diagnosis 
of diabetes mellitus or a fasting glucose of 126 mg/dL or 
higher. Information about smoking history was ascertained 
at baseline. Total cholesterol levels, high-density lipopro- 
tein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and triglycerides were 
measured in blood samples at baseline, using well-estab- 
lished quality-assurance methods.20 Low-density lipopro- 
tein cholesterol (LDL-C) was estimated using Friedewald’s 
formula.21 
Diagnosis of Stroke 
Methods for the classiﬁcation of stroke status and subtype 
in the CHS have been reported elsewhere in detail.22,23 
Brieﬂy, comprehensive protocols were conducted to identify 
cerebrovascular events or death during the course of the 
study. Participants were contacted every 6 months to es- 
tablish vital status and to screen for the occurrence of 
events. Conﬁrmation of events and deaths were conducted 
through review of medical records, death certiﬁcates and 
the Medicare healthcare utilization database for hospital- 
izations. Participants and contacts of participants unavail- 
able for follow-up were interviewed about the event or 
death. When stroke was suspected, the study neurologist at 
the study site reviewed all sources of information (medical 
records and death certiﬁcates). Raters did not have access to 
participants’ CES-D scores. The cerebrovascular adjudica- 
tion committee, comprising study neurologists from each of 
four study sites, a neuroradiologist from the magnetic res- 
onance imaging reading center, and an internist or neurol- 
ogist representing the Coordinating Center reviewed all 
cerebrovascular events and all deaths. A neurologist in each 
center abstracted and reviewed hospital records for all re- 
ported strokes with International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision, codes 430 through 438 identifying cerebro- 
vascular disease. Neuroimaging studies were completed for 
86% of the participants. The committee considered all 
clinical and radiological information to decide whether a 
nonfatal stroke or fatal stroke had occurred and, if appro- 
priate, assigned a stroke type: ischemic, hemorrhagic, or 
uncertain. The committee considered a death to be related 




The Kaplan–Meier curve shows that subjects with high de- 
pressive scores ( (cid:2)8 points) had greater risk of stroke than 
subjects with low depressive scores (o8 points), with no 
stabilization of risk. The difference in the risk of stroke 
between the two categories of depressive symptoms 
was highly statistically signiﬁcant (log rank value 5 8.33, 
P 5.004). 
The baseline characteristics of the study cohort ac- 
cording to stroke status are presented in Table 1. Partici- 
pants with incident ischemic stroke were more likely to be 
older and nonprofessional; have an income less than 
$25,000; have a lower educational level; and be widowed, 
divorced, or separated. No differences were found accord- 
ing to sex or race. Participants with stroke were more likely 
to have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, im- 
paired fasting glucose, and coronary heart disease and 
higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, 
triglycerides, and depressive scores than their counterparts 
without stroke. No differences were found according to 
BMI, HDL-C, or LDL-C. Mean and median baseline CRP 
was signiﬁcantly higher in the stroke group than in the 
control group (Po.01). Participants with higher depressive 
scores were more likely to be older, female, African Amer- 
ican, and nonprofessional; have an income less than 
$25,000; have a lower educational level; and be widowed, 
divorced, or separated. Compared to those with lower 
depressive scores participants with higher depressive symp- 
toms scores were also more likely to have a history of hy- 
pertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease; to 
be a current smoker; and to have higher BMI, HDL-C, and 
CRP levels than those with lower depressive symptoms 
scores. 
During a median follow-up of 11 years, 607 incident 
ischemic strokes occurred: an incidence rate of 12.1 strokes 
per 1,000 person-years. Incidence rates were 14.9 and 11.4 
strokes per 1,000 person-years for individuals with and 
without depression, respectively (Po.01). When subjects 
without depression were stratiﬁed according to CRP levels, 
stroke incidence rates were lowest in the lowest CRP tertile 
(9.6 per 1,000 person-years) and highest in the highest CRP 
tertile (13.2 per 1,000 person-years). For participants with 
higher depressive scores, a higher incidence rate was 
detected in the third tertile of CRP, with a range from 
12.3 to 18.3 per 1,000 person-years. 
Multivariate Survival Analysis 
The unadjusted HR of ischemic stroke was 1.32 (95% 
CI 5 1.09–1.59) for higher depressive symptoms. After 
adding the CRP term (as a continuous variable), the HR 
was not attenuated and was equal to 1.31 (95% CI 5 1.08– 
1.58). After adjustment for sociodemographic characteris- 
tics (age, sex, race, occupation, income, education, and 
marital status) and traditional stroke risk factors (choles- 
terol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, BMI, high blood pres- 
status, and CHD status), depressed 
sure, diabetes 
individuals had a 26% greater HR of ischemic stroke. Add- 
ing the CRP term as a continuous variable instead of a 
categorical variable to the fully adjusted model, the asso- 
ciation between depressive mood and stroke remained 
of similar magnitude, and CRP contributed signiﬁcantly 
to stroke risk. 
to a stroke when a majority opinion was that, more likely 
than not, the death would not have occurred in the absence 
of stroke. Stroke was deﬁned as a neurological deﬁcit of 
rapid onset lasting more than 24 hours or, if less than 24 
hours, an appropriate lesion to explain the deﬁcit seen on 
brain imaging. Time of stroke was established according to 
the ﬁrst diagnosis, if recorded in medical records, or on the 
death certiﬁcate. 
Statistical Analysis 
The chi-square (w2) test was used to assess associations be- 
tween categorical variables. Differences in means of risk 
factors levels between the depressed group and the nonde- 
pressed group were tested using a t-test. Because of skewed 
distribution, CRP was log transformed for analyses when 
indicated. Incidence rates of stroke were calculated accord- 
ing to depressive symptoms category. Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to compute HRs as estimates of 
relative risk of stroke for high depressive scores, with ad- 
justment for sociodemographic (age, sex, race, occupation, 
income, education level, marital status) and classic stroke 
risk factors (hypertension status, diabetes mellitus status, 
smoking, CHD status, cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, tri- 
glycerides, and BMI) (Figure 1). 
The interaction between depressive symptoms and CRP 
as continuous variables and as categorical variables was 
tested. To determine the extent to which inﬂammation me- 
diates the relationship between depressive symptoms and 
stroke, Cox regression was used to compare the analyses 
with and without CRP in the unadjusted and adjusted 
models. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 
version 7.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). All tests 
were two sided, and statistical signiﬁcance was considered 
at an alpha level of 0.05. 
RESULTS 
Of the 5,888 participants in the study, 249 were excluded 
because of the presence of baseline stroke. Thus, 5,639 were 
considered for this analysis. Because there was no relation- 
ship between depressive symptoms and hemorrhagic 
strokes (n 5 114), hemorrhagic strokes were also excluded 
from the remaining analyses, leaving 5,525 participants.

Stratiﬁed Analyses 
Whether depressive symptoms and inﬂammation might act 
synergistically to increase risk of stroke was analyzed (Table 
2). Both variables (depressive symptoms and CRP) were 
ﬁrst modeled as continuous variables at baseline. In these 
analyses, the interaction term did not meet criteria for sta- 
tistical signiﬁcance (P 5.85), although the main effect terms 
for depressive symptoms and CRP remained statistically 
signiﬁcant. When the data were analyzed according to ter- 
tiles of CRP, there appeared to be a J-shaped relationship, 
with the highest risk for participants with the highest CRP 
levels. Adjustment for multiple factors did not appreciably 
change the relationships. 
DISCUSSION 
These analyses demonstrated a positive 
relationship 
between baseline higher depressive symptoms and risk of 
ischemic stroke. Older adults with a depressive symptom 
score in the range of clinical depression at baseline had, on 
average, a 32% greater HR for ischemic stroke. This HR 
was minimally lower after adjustment for sociodemographic

characteristics and other traditional stroke risk factors, 
including smoking and existing clinical cardiovascular 
disease. There was essentially no association between de- 
pressive symptoms and hemorrhagic stroke. These results 
conﬁrm those reported in other prospective studies.1–3,5,7,8 
Even though there was a positive association between 
level of CRP and baseline depressive symptoms, it was not 
found that CRP acted as an important mediator in the re- 
lationship between depressive symptoms and stroke. It is 
possible that the relationship between depressive symptoms 
and stroke was too weak to allow an adequate test of in- 
ﬂammation as a mediator. Another aspect of the analysis 
that should be kept in mind is that CRP was measured 
at baseline. Although little is known about the temporal 
relationship between depressive symptoms and CRP, it is 
possible that the results would have been different if CRP 
had been measured months or years after the depressive 
symptoms were measured. This would be a more-deﬁnitive 
test of inﬂammation as a mediator between depressive 
symptoms and stroke. Because it has been suggested that the 
association between CRP and stroke might be stronger in 
men than in women,11 a stratiﬁed analysis was conducted 
based on sex. The results for men and women were similar, 
with no suggestion that inﬂammation was an important 
mediator for the relationship between depressive symptoms 
and stroke. CRP was an inﬂammatory indicator in our 
analyses. Interleukin-6 and other inﬂammatory markers 
could be mediators in the relationship between depression 
and stroke.24 The data from the current study suggest that 
there may be pathways other than inﬂammation by which 
depressive symptoms act as a risk for stroke. Possibilities 
include platelet dysfunction, abnormalities in blood coag- 
ulation, endothelial dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, 
and abnormalities in heart rate variability.25–28 
A pattern was identiﬁed in unadjusted and fully ad- 
justed models, indicating that depressed individuals in the 
highest tertile of CRP had a greater risk of stroke than those 
in the other two tertiles. Although this relationship needs to 
be conﬁrmed before changing any clinical practice guide- 
lines, 
it is possible that the combination of depressive 
symptoms and elevated CRP may be useful for targeting 
interventions to a high-risk group. 
LIMITATIONS 
These analyses have some limitations. First, no diagnostic 
conﬁrmation of depression was completed. Depressive 
symptoms as the exposure variable was considered to be a 
proxy for a clinical diagnosis of major depression. The CES-D 
has been found to be a good screening instrument for 
major depression with good to excellent sensitivity and 
speciﬁcity.18 The results might have been different if there 
had been a measure of clinical depression. For example, a 
previous study reported ﬁndings indicating a dose–response 
relationship between diagnostically deﬁned depression and 
stroke.7 Second, there is the possibility of residual con- 
founding, although the maximum information available for 
the reported statistical models was used, and it was possible 
to include information on a number of potential confound- 
ing factors. In addition, depressive symptoms were assessed 
as a continuous and a categorical variable. The consistency 
of ﬁndings was preserved. Third, the possibility cannot be 
excluded that higher depressive symptoms scores are not a 
consequence of subclinical strokes. The clinical evidence of 
stroke at baseline was used as an exclusion criterion. 
Subclinical cases could have been identiﬁed using MRI. Al- 
though the CHS investigators conducted an MRI evalua- 
tion, it was done in the third year of the study and not at 
baseline. Consequently, it was decided not to use this in- 
formation. Fourth, the CHS participants might differ with 
respect to some characteristics from the general older adult 
population, although the rate of higher depressive symptom 
scores in this study was comparable with what has been 
found in other studies of older adults in the general pop- 
ulation. There is no evidence to support a selection differ- 
ential according to depression status, and the internal 
validity necessary for comparisons should be preserved. 
Notwithstanding these limitations, the current report 
improves understanding of the relationships between de- 
pressive symptoms and inﬂammation with the subsequent 
development of ischemic stroke. Future analyses will need 
to explore in more detail the temporal relationships be- 
tween depressive symptoms and inﬂammatory markers and 
to examine other mechanisms that may mediate the effect of 
depression on cerebrovascular disease. Depression has been 
found to be a risk factor for a wide range of cardiovascular 
diseases and has been associated with some measures of 
subclinical atherosclerosis,29 suggesting that platelet aggre- 
gation is not the sole mechanism. Multiple pathways lead- 
ing to atherosclerosis will need to be considered.
