Older Adults

Objective: Individuals with high levels of depressive symptoms have an increased risk of many illnesses, including 
stroke. Measures of depressive symptoms include questions about the presence of negative affect, such as sadness, 
as well as the absence of positive affect, such as happiness and optimism. We assessed whether positive or negative 
affect, or both, predicted risk of stroke. Methods: Data were from a 6-year prospective cohort study of a population- 
based sample of 2478 older whites and blacks from five counties in North Carolina who reported no history of stroke 
at the baseline interview. Baseline, in-person interviews were conducted to gather information on sociodemo- 
graphic, psychosocial, and health-related characteristics of subjects. Thereafter interviews were conducted annu- 
ally for 6 years. Results: Increasing scores on the modified version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies 
Depression Scale (CES-D) were significantly associated with stroke incidence for the overall sample (relative risk 
[RR] 5 1.04 for each one-point increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5 1.01–1.09) over the 6-year follow-up period 
after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking status, and selected 
chronic diseases. Positive affect score demonstrated a strong inverse association with stroke incidence (RR 5 0.74, 
95% CI 5 0.62– 0.88). Conclusions: Increasing scores on the modified CES-D are related to an increased risk of 
stroke, whereas high levels of positive affect seem to protect against stroke in older adults. Key words: stroke, 
positive affect, depression, emotional well-being, aging.

Stroke is the third most common cause of death and 
a leading cause of long-term disability among the el- 
derly (1). Approximately 400,000 new stroke cases 
occur each year in the United States (2). Previous 
epidemiologic and clinical studies have identified 
modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors of stroke. 
Nonmodifiable risk factors include age, male sex, race, 
and other hereditary factors (3–5). Modifiable risk fac- 
tors include smoking, obesity, excess alcohol use, low 
level of exercise (3– 8), hypertension, and diabetes 
(3– 8). 
An additional and potentially modifiable risk factor 
for stroke is emotional well-being. Several studies 
have shown that individuals with high levels of de- 
pressive symptoms are at higher risk for stroke (6 – 8). 
However, scales that assess depressive symptomatol-

ogy include questions about the presence of negative 
affect and the absence of positive affect. Measurements 
of positive and negative affect have been shown to be 
relatively independent of each other, and the two mea- 
sures correlate with different personal characteristics 
(9, 10). Moreover, positive affect is not simply the lack 
of depressive symptoms (9). Persons in a positive 
mood are more likely to engage in social relationships 
(8), to be optimistic about their future (7), to cope 
successfully with stressful situations (11), and to feel 
in control of their lives (11). Conversely, negative af- 
fect is related to depression or depressive mood, in- 
creased anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness (9 –12). 
Separate neural networks seem to regulate positive 
and negative emotions, with dopamine metabolism 
associated with positive affect and serotonin associ- 
ated with negative affect (13, 14). 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
relationship between emotional well-being and inci- 
dence of stroke in older adults. We asked which com- 
ponents of emotional well-being, negative affect, pos- 
itive affect, or both, are associated with risk of stroke. 


Data are from the North Carolina EPESE study, a population- 
based study of 4162 noninstitutionalized, community-dwelling 
adults. Sampling and data collection procedures are described else- 
where (15). Briefly, in 1986, subjects 65 years of age or older were 
identified using a four-stage stratified probability sample drawn 
from five counties in North Carolina. Baseline data were collected by 
in-person interviews, during which information on sociodemo- 
graphic, psychosocial, and health-related characteristics of subjects 
was gathered. Annual follow-up interviews were conducted for the 
next 6 years. In 1989 and 1992, in-person interviews were con- 
ducted; telephone interviews were conducted in the intervening 
years. This study included data on 2478 subjects (772 men and 1706 


women) who had no history of stroke at baseline and for whom 
complete stroke information was available at all follow-up inter- 
views; this sample represents 65.4% of those who were stroke-free at 
baseline. 

Emotional well-being. The CES-D scale is widely used in com- 
munity settings as a measure of depressive symptomatology (16). 
The scale consists of 20 items in which subjects are asked whether 
they have experienced certain feelings or symptoms in the past 
week. A modified version of the CES-D scale was presented to 
subjects in a “yes” (reported the symptom at least some of the time 
during the previous 2 weeks) or “no” (rarely or none of the time 
during the previous 2 weeks) format. Scores on the modified CES-D 
range from 0 to 20, with increasing scores indicating poorer emo- 
tional well-being. 
Factor analysis has demonstrated that the CES-D has a two-factor 
structure with a negative and positive valence (17–19). The 16-item 
negative affect structure includes the following items: “I felt that I 
could not shake off the blues even with help from my family and 
friends,” “I felt depressed,” “I thought my life had been a failure,” “I 
felt fearful,” “I felt lonely,” “I had crying spells,” “I felt sad,” “I was 
bothered by things that usually don’t bother me,” “I did not feel like 
eating; my appetite was poor,” “I had trouble keeping my mind on 
what I was doing,” “I felt everything I did was an effort,” “My sleep 
was restless,” “It seemed that I talked less than usual,” “People were 
unfriendly,” “I felt that people disliked me,” and “I could not get 
going.” Higher scores on the negative affect scale indicate higher 
depressive symptomatology. The remaining four items make up the 
positive affect structure: “I felt that I was just as good as other 
people,” “I felt hopeful about the future,” “I was happy,” and “I 
enjoyed life.” The score on this scale ranges from 0 to 4, with higher 
scores indicating higher positive affect. Baseline scores for the mod- 
ified CES-D were obtained by reversing the score on the four positive 
affect items and summing it with the 16 negative affect items. In 
addition to using the modified CES-D score as a continuous variable, 
we also dichotomized the scale. Blazer et al. (20) determined that a 
cutoff point of 9 on the modified CES-D was equivalent to a cutoff 
point of 16 on the original scale. Individuals who score 9 or more on 
the modified CES-D are classified as having high levels of depressive 
symptomatology. 
Stroke. The data collected for the North Carolina EPESE study 
included information on a number of chronic health conditions, 
including stroke. The incidence of stroke was calculated by sum- 
ming the number of physician-diagnosed strokes reported at any 
follow-up interview and the number of deaths in which stroke 
(ICD-9 codes 430 – 438) was listed as the immediate or underlying 
cause of death. During the 6-year follow-up period, 340 strokes 
occurred in the study population; 265 were nonfatal and 75 were 
fatal. 
Covariates. Baseline variables used in the analyses included gen- 
der, age (65–74, 75– 84, and $85 years), marital status, household 
income (,$10,000 and $$10,000), number of years of education 
(0 – 8, 8 –11, 12, and .12), BMI (,22, 22–29.9, and $30), any smok- 
ing in the last month, and physician-diagnosed heart disease or 
diabetes. Blood pressure was measured twice using a standard mer- 
cury sphygmomanometer with an appropriately sized cuff after the 
subject had remained seated for at least 5 minutes, according to the 
standard protocol used in the Hypertension Detection and Fol- 
low-Up Program (21). Blood pressure was categorized as a mean 
systolic pressure of ,140 mm Hg, $140 to ,160 mm Hg, or $160 
mm Hg at baseline. 


Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the RR of 
stroke over 6 years from the modified CES-D score at baseline as well 
as from scores on the negative and positive affect subscales, adjust- 
ing for baseline sociodemographic variables, heart attack, diabetes, 
hypertension, BMI, and smoking status. Analyses were stratified by 
gender or ethnicity. SAS software was used for these analyses. 

Table 1 presents baseline characteristics of the total 
sample by gender. Most subjects were nonsmokers and 
had a BMI between 22 and 29.9. Fourteen percent of 
the total sample reported heart disease, 17% reported 
diabetes, and 53% had a systolic blood pressure $140 
mm Hg. 
Table 2 shows the correlations for scores on the 
modified CES-D and the positive and negative sub- 
scales by covariates at baseline. The score on the mod- 
ified CES-D was strongly correlated with female gen-

der, unmarried marital status, low household income 
(,$10,000), less education, and heart attack. Similar 
findings were observed for the 16-item negative affect 
scale. Positive affect was most strongly correlated with 
higher income ($$10,000) and higher education. 
Table 3 shows the RR of stroke during follow-up by 
the continuous modified CES-D score after adjusting 
for baseline sociodemographic characteristics, behav- 

ioral factors, and chronic disease. For the total sample, 
the RR for stroke increased by 4% for each one-point 
increase in score on the modified CES-D. Each unit 
increase in score for men was associated with a 9% 
increase in stroke incidence. Women also showed an 
association between increasing CES-D score and stroke 
incidence, although the relationship did not reach sig- 
nificance. Other significant independent predictors of 
stroke (eg, controlling for the other explanatory factors 
in the model) included older age, less education, un- 
derweight, current smoking, heart disease, diabetes, 
and hypertension at baseline. Interaction effects with 
gender were also investigated for the variables in Table 
3. With the exception of a gender-by-age interaction (p 
, .006), there were no significant interactions. Women 
were observed to have a greater increase in the risk of 
stroke with increasing age as compared with men. 
In addition, scores on the modified CES-D were 
dichotomized, with a score $9 representing depres- 
sive symptomatology. The results indicate a nonsignif- 
icant relationship between a score of 9 or more and 
incident stroke (RR 5 1.30, 95% CI 5 0.85–1.99, p , 
.23).

a A total of 340 strokes (117 in men and 223 in women) occurred during the 6-year follow-up period. All subjects were stroke-free at baseline. 
b Each point increase in positive and negative affect is associated with the respective RR for stroke. 
positive affect and 16-item negative affect subscales on 
the incidence of stroke stratified by gender and adjust- 
ing for all variables included in Table 3. There was a 
significant and inverse association between positive 
affect and incidence of stroke for both men and 
women. Results were stronger for men, in whom each 
unit increase in positive affect was associated with a 
41% decrease in the incidence of stroke, than for 
women, in whom each unit increase in positive affect 
was associated with a 18% decrease in stroke 
incidence. 
There were nonsignificant trends between negative 
affect scores and stroke incidence for the entire sample 
and for men and women separately. Results for the 
other predictors of stroke were similar to those listed 
in Table 3. 
Table 5 shows the relationship between stroke and 
the 4-item positive affect and 16-item negative affect 
subscales stratified by race and adjusting for sociode- 
mographic and health characteristics. A significant in- 
verse relationship between positive affect and stroke 
was observed for both older whites and blacks. Each 
unit increase in positive affect was associated with a 
32% decrease in the risk of stroke for whites and a 
27% decrease in risk for blacks. 

The role of depressive symptomatology has re- 
ceived increased attention because of its impact on 
chronic disease and disability in older populations (2, 
6 – 8, 22–24). The present study supplements the ob- 
servations of earlier studies with two important find- 
ings. First, the influence of depressive symptomatol- 
ogy on stroke is independent of other known risk 
factors for stroke. Second, measures of positive affect 
are more strongly linked to stroke incidence than are 
measures of negative affect. For the overall sample, the 
risk of stroke increased by 4% for each unit (one-point) 
increase in score on the modified CES-D after adjusting 
for sociodemographic characteristics and other known 
risk factors for stroke. We then divided the CES-D into 
its two main components, the 16-item negative affect 
subscale and the 4-item positive affect subscale. Our 
results suggest that increasing levels of positive affect 
are strongly associated with a reduced risk of stroke. 
This inverse association between positive affect and 
stroke held for the entire sample, by gender and by 
race, after controlling for known risk factors of stroke 
and for negative affect score.

a A total of 340 strokes (152 in whites and 188 in blacks) occurred during the 6-year follow-up period. All subjects were stroke-free at baseline. 
b Each point increase in positive and negative affect is associated with the respective RR for stroke. 
for the overall sample and for men in particular. Being 
unmarried also had a significant relationship with in- 
cident stroke for women and blacks. This finding may 
be due to the increased number of stressors facing 
older women. In addition to living alone, older women 
typically report more health problems than men. Thus, 
the additive effect of being unmarried and the greater 
health burdens of old age may make older women 
more vulnerable to stroke. In general, higher systolic 
blood pressure was related to incident stroke for men 
and women as well as for whites and blacks. 
Various mechanisms can be proposed to account for 
the association between positive affect and stroke in- 
cidence. Positive affect is related to a number of char- 
acteristics known to improve health or to protect 
against chronic disease. Individuals who report high 
levels of positive affect may be more likely to exercise, 
to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and to adhere to med- 
ical therapy. In addition, the recently described asso- 
ciations between moderate alcohol consumption and 
lower risk of stroke (25) might be linked to our findings 
of a protective effect of positive affect on stroke. Al- 
though we do not have reliable information on alcohol 
intake in our population, Poikolainen and Vartiainen 
(26) reported that the consumption of one to four 
drinks of wine per week was significantly associated 
with good subjective health for men and women aged 
25 to 64, and moderate consumption of alcohol rela- 
tive to heavy consumption seems to reduce the risk of 
total stroke and ischemic stroke by reducing platelet 
aggregation and fibrinogen levels as well as by increas- 
ing levels of tissue plasminogen activator (24). 
There are a number of limitations to this study. 
First, because we used self-reported data, we were 
unable to determine the severity of the stroke, its lo- 
cation, or type. In addition, it is possible that some 
individuals may have experienced a stroke without 
their knowledge or their physician’s knowledge before 
the baseline interview. Second, the inverse relation- 
ship observed between positive affect and stroke inci- 
dence is not necessarily causal and may be mediated 
by some unmeasured variable. However, a strong rela- 
tionship between positive affect remained for men and 
women and for whites and blacks after controlling for 
known risk factors of stroke. Thus, the results of our 
analyses suggest an independent and protective effect 
of positive affect on incidence of stroke. A third limi- 
tation may be the use of the modified CES-D. Because 



each item on the modified version was collapsed from 
a four-level response to a dichotomous response, some 
of the variability in the original scale may have been 
lost. Blazer et al. (20) report, however, that the modi- 
fied CES-D produced results similar to those obtained 
with the original CES-D when tested on individuals 
from the New Haven EPESE study. Finally, our mea- 
sure of positive affect is relatively crude. Because pos- 
itive affect encompasses such overlapping concepts as 
happiness, self-efficacy, personal growth, optimism, 
autonomy, and morale, one could argue that it would 
not be well represented by a four-item scale (27). On 
the other hand, this scale was a relatively robust, in- 
dependent predictor of stroke, which validates its abil- 
ity to discriminate within a population. 
In conclusion, degree of positive affect is strongly 
associated with risk of stroke. Together with known 
risk factors of stroke, an individual’s emotional state 
may play a role in stroke risk. Perhaps the next step is 
to investigate whether interventions aimed at improv- 
ing an older individual’s level of positive affect can 
reduce his or her risk of stroke or improve recovery 
from stroke.
