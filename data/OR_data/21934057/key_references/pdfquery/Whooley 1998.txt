Association Between Depressive Symptoms 
and Mortality in Older Women

Background: Major depression is associated with 
increased mortality, but it is not known whether 
patients who report depressive symptoms have greater 
mortality. 
Subjects and Methods: We performed a prospective 
cohort study of 7518 white women 67 years of age or older 
who were recruited from population-based listings in Bal- 
timore, Md, Minneapolis, Minn, Portland, Ore, and the 
Monongahela Valley, Pa. Participants completed the Ge- 
riatric Depression Scale (short form) and were consid- 
ered depressed if they reported 6 or more of 15 possible 
symptoms of depression. Women were followed up for 
an average of 6 years. If a participant died, we obtained 
a copy of the official death certificate and hospital re- 
cords, if available, and used International Classification 
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes to classify death attrib- 
utable to cardiovascular, cancer, or noncancer, noncar- 
diovascular cause. 
Results: Mortality during 7-year follow-up varied from 
7% in women with no depressive symptoms to 17% in 
those with 3 to 5 symptoms to 24% in those with 6 or 
more symptoms of depression (P(cid:44).001). Of 473 women 
(6.3%) with 6 or more depressive symptoms at baseline, 
24% died (111 deaths in 2610 woman-years of follow- 
up) compared with 11% of women who reported 5 or 
fewer symptoms of depression (760 deaths in 41 460 
woman-years of follow-up) (P(cid:44).001). Women with 6 or 
more depressive symptoms had a 2-fold increased risk 
of death (age-adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.14; 95% con- 
fidence interval [CI], 1.75-2.61; P(cid:44).001) compared with 
those who had 5 or fewer depressive symptoms. This as- 
sociation remained strong after adjusting for potential con- 
founding variables, including history of myocardial in- 
farction, stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, perceived health, 
and cognitive function (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.14-1.88; 
P = .003). Depressive symptoms were associated with 
an increased adjusted risk of death from cardiovascular 
diseases (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.5; P = .003), and non- 
cancer, noncardiovascular diseases (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 
1.2-2.7; P = .01), but were not associated with deaths from 
cancer (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.7; P = .93). 
Conclusions: Depressive symptoms are a significant risk 
factor for cardiovascular and noncancer, noncardiovascu- 
lar mortality but not cancer mortality in older women. 
Whether depressive symptoms are a marker for, or a cause 
of, life-threatening conditions remains to be determined.

agnosed major depres- 
sion is associated with 
found that clinically di- 
increased mortality, but 
it is unclear whether depressive symp- 
toms, such as those recognized in a rou- 
tine office visit or on a simple screening in- 
strument, predict mortality. Prior studies14-20 
have found that depressive symptoms are 
associated with poor health and functional 
status, as well as increased disability, health 
care utilization, and cost of health ser- 
vices. However, results have been inconsis- 
tent regarding a possible association be- 
tween depressive symptoms and mortality. 
Two large studies21,22 found no asso- 
ciation between baseline depressive symp- 
toms and subsequent mortality, but 2 oth- 
ers23,24 reported greater mortality in 
patients with depressive symptoms. Of 
these 2 studies, one23 was limited to pa- 
tients with preexisting coronary artery dis- 
ease and the other24 did not control for co- 
morbid illnesses. Neither examined 
mortality from causes other than ische- 
mic heart disease. 
We measured depressive symptoms 
in a cohort of older women and followed 
them up for an average of 6 years. We ex- 
amined the association between depres- 
sive symptoms and mortality from spe- 
cific causes such as coronary heart disease, 
cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart 
failure, cancer, and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease.

A total of 9704 ambulatory women at least 65 years of age 
were recruited from population-based listings in Balti- 
more, Md, Minneapolis, Minn, Portland, Ore, and the 
Monongahela Valley, Pa, between 1986 and 1988 for the 
Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, a prospective cohort study 
designed to determine risk factors for osteoporotic frac- 
tures. At a second visit (1988-1990), 7518 of these women 
(80% of survivors) completed at least 10 of 15 items on the 
Geriatric Depression Scale. These 7518 women are the sub- 
jects of this secondary data analysis. The study was ap- 
proved by the appropriate institutional review boards, and 
all subjects provided written informed consent. 


At the second visit (1988-1990), we administered the Geri- 
atric Depression Scale short form, a validated, reliable, 15- 
item, self-report, depressive symptoms checklist designed to 
detect the presence of current depression in the elderly.25 Us- 
ing a cutoff point of 6 or more symptoms, the Geriatric De- 
pression Scale short form has a sensitivity of 88% and speci- 
ficity of 62% compared with a structured clinical interview 
for depression.26 We defined depression as 6 or more symp- 
toms, with 6 to 7 symptoms indicating mild depression, 8 
to 10 symptoms indicating moderate depression, and 11 or 
more symptoms indicating severe depression.27 For partici- 
pants who failed to complete all 15 items, we calculated the 
total number of depressive symptoms by dividing the re- 
ported number of symptoms by the proportion of items com- 
pleted. To determine the effect of persistent depressive symp- 
toms on subsequent mortality, we also administered the same 
instrument 4 years later (1992-1994) to 5837 of the origi- 
nal 7518 women (83% of survivors). 
Self-reported age, marital status, education, medical his- 
tory, current perceived health status (excellent/good vs 
fair/poor/very poor), smoking, alcohol, and use of ben- 
zodiazepine, barbiturates, thiazide diuretics, and estro- 
gen were determined from a questionnaire administered 
at the first visit and reviewed by an interviewer. Systolic 
and diastolic blood pressures were measured at the right 
brachial artery using a standard protocol.28 Hypertension 
was defined as systolic blood pressure higher than 160 
mm Hg, diastolic blood pressures higher than 90 mm 
Hg, or use of a thiazide diuretic. We measured social 
network by scoring answers to 11 questions regarding 
contact with spouse, relatives, and friends, then adding 
scores for the individual questions to create a total social 
network score. Higher scores indicate better social net- 
work. 
Physical activity was estimated using a modified Paffen- 
barger scale that assesses the type and duration of weight- 
bearing activities in a variety of settings.29 Participants were 
asked about the frequency with which they performed each 
of 40 activities at 4 time points during their lives (teen- 
ager, age 30 years, age 50 years, and previous year). For 
each of the 4 time points, the number of times per year each 
activity was performed was multiplied by 5.0 for low- 
intensity (eg, walking or gardening), 7.5 for medium- 
intensity (eg, dancing or tennis), or 10.0 for high- 
intensity activities (eg, jogging or skiing). Scores for these 
4 time points were added to calculate lifetime physical 
activity. 
At the second visit, weight was measured (in light in- 
door clothing with shoes removed) using a balance beam 
scale, and height was measured using a stadiometer.30 Body 
mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided 
by the square of the height in meters. Cognitive function 
was measured by a trained examiner using Digit Symbol, a 
subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.31 Scores 
on Digit Symbol reflect the number correct within the timed 
trial; thus, lower scores indicate poorer performance. 

The prevalence of depression (defined as a score (cid:36)6 on 
the Geriatric Depression Scale short form) was 6.3% (473/ 
7518). Compared with those who had 5 or fewer symp- 
toms of depression, women with 6 or more symptoms 
were older and more likely to smoke or to report fair or 
poor health. They had a higher frequency of medical ill- 
nesses, worse functional status, and worse cognitive func- 
tion. They were less likely to be married, well-educated, 
or physically active (Table 1). Follow-up was com- 
plete in 7406 women (99%) who completed the depres- 
sion scale. Of the 112 women lost to follow-up, 5.4% had 
6 or more depressive symptoms. Mortality varied from 
7% in women with no depressive symptoms to 17% in 
those with 3 to 5 symptoms to 24% in those with 6 or 
more symptoms of depression (P(cid:44).001 for trend) 
(Figure 1). 
Deaths occurred in 24% of women with 6 or more 
depressive symptoms (111 deaths in 2610 woman-years 
of follow-up) and 11% of women with 5 or fewer depres- 
sive symptoms (760 deaths in 41 460 woman-years of fol- 
low-up) (P(cid:44).001). Participants who subsequently died 
had a mean (±SD) depression score of 2.6 ± 2.7, com- 
pared with 1.6 ± 2.1 in participants who were alive at fol- 
low-up (P(cid:44).001). 
Women with 6 or more depressive symptoms had 
a 2-fold increased risk of death (age-adjusted HR, 2.14; 
95% CI, 1.75-2.61; P(cid:44).001) compared with those who 
had 5 or fewer symptoms. This association remained 
strong after adjusting for potential confounding vari- 
ables (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.14-1.88; P = .003) (Table 2). 
Each 1-symptom increase in number of depressive 
symptoms was associated with a 6% increase in all- 
cause mortality (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.10; P(cid:44).001), 
adjusting for history of myocardial infarction, stroke, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension, smoking, perceived health, and 
cognitive function. 
Of 473 women who had 6 or more depressive symp- 
toms in 1988-1990, 297 completed the Geriatric Depres- 
sion Scale short form again 4 years later, and 159 (53.5%)

To determine whether impaired functional status is an an- 
tecedent of depressive symptoms (ie, potential cause of both 
depression and mortality that should be adjusted for in the 
primary analysis) or an effect of depressive symptoms (ie, 
potential mechanism linking depressive symptoms and mor- 
tality that should not be adjusted for in the primary analy- 
sis), we measured functional status and depressive symp- 
toms at 2 time points: at the 1988-1990 visit and again 4 
years later. 
Functional status was measured on a 39-point scale 
with up to 3 points (some difficulty, much difficulty, or 
unable to do) for each of 13 activities (eg, dressing, bath- 
ing, preparing meals, doing housework, shopping, or walk- 
ing 2 or 3 blocks) based on a modified version of the Stan- 
ford Health Assessment Questionnaire.32 We defined 
impaired functional status as a score of 14 or more be- 
cause this number required that the respondent report much 
difficulty with at least 1 of the 13 activities. 
To ascertain whether impaired functional status pre- 
cedes the development of depressive symptoms, we first ex- 
cluded women who had 6 or more depressive symptoms 
in 1988-1990, and then measured the incidence of depres- 
sion (defined as a score (cid:36)6 on the Geriatric Depression Scale 
in 1992-1994), comparing women who had impaired func- 
tional status in 1988-1990 with those who had normal func- 
tional status at that time. To ascertain whether impaired 
functional status is an effect of depressive symptoms, we 
first excluded women who had impaired functional status 
in 1988-1990, and then measured the incidence of im- 
paired functional status (score (cid:36)14) in the ensuing 4 years, 
comparing women who had 6 or more depressive symp- 
toms in 1988-1990 with those who had 5 or fewer symp- 
toms at that time. 

Mortality was ascertained for an average of 6 years (range, 
up to 7 years) following the initial depression measure. If 
a participant died, we obtained a copy of the official death 
certificate and hospital records, if available; the cause of 
death was assigned by one of us (W.S.B.) who was 
unaware of results from the Geriatric Depression Scale or 
other predictor measurements. We used International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes33 to classify 
death due to cardiovascular (codes 394-402, 410-414, 
424-444, and 798), cancer (codes 141-238 and 259), or 
noncancer, noncardiovascular cause. We specifically iden- 
tified deaths from coronary heart disease (codes 410-414 
and 429), cerebrovascular disease (codes 430-438), con- 
gestive heart failure (code 425), sudden death (code 798), 
lung cancer (codes 162-163), breast cancer (code 174), 
colon cancer (codes 153-154), chronic obstructive pul- 
monary disease (codes 491-496), pneumonia (code 486), 
accidents and trauma (codes 800-805, 852-994, and 
E812-E890), and natural causes (code 799.9). Three 
women who died from suicide were excluded from all 
analyses. 

Differences in baseline characteristics between women 
with and without depression were compared using (cid:120)2 
tests for dichotomous variables and t tests for continu- 
ous variables. The association between depressive symp- 
toms and mortality was analyzed using proportional haz- 
ards models. We used forward stepwise proportional 
hazards regression to obtain adjusted risk estimates, 
adding those variables associated with mortality (at 
P(cid:44).05) to multivariate models that included depression. 
We verified the proportionality assumption of these 
models. The association between depressive symptoms 
and functional status was analyzed using logistic regres- 
sion. For all analyses, we report the hazard ratio (HR) or 
odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Survival curves were estimated using an adjusted Cox 
proportional hazards model.34 Analyses were performed 
with the use of SAS statistical software (SAS Institute 
Inc, Cary, NC). 
of 297 had persistent depressive symptoms. Death oc- 
curred in 11.3% of women with 6 or more depressive 
symptoms at both time points (18 deaths in 971 woman- 
years of follow-up) and 4.3% of women with 5 or fewer 
depressive symptoms at both time points (223 deaths in 
32 232 woman-years of follow-up) (P(cid:44).001). Women 
with persistent depressive symptoms had a 2.5-fold in- 
creased risk of death (age-adjusted HR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.56- 
4.09; P(cid:44).001) compared with those who reported 5 or 
fewer symptoms at both time points, an association that 
persisted but did not remain statistically significant af- 
ter adjusting for the variables listed in Table 2 (HR, 1.63; 
95% CI, 0.86-3.07; P = .13). 
We found that depressive symptoms are both a cause 
and an effect of impaired functional status. Among the 
7045 participants who had 5 or fewer depressive symp- 
toms in 1988-1990, those with impaired functional sta- 
tus (n = 172) had a mean (± SD) depression score of 3.5 
± 2.8 at follow-up compared with 1.6 ± 1.9 in women 
with normal functional status (P(cid:44).001); women with im- 
paired functional status were more likely to develop de- 
pressive symptoms than those with normal functional sta- 
tus (24% vs 5%; OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3-8.5; P(cid:44).001). 
Among the 7277 participants who had normal func- 
tional status in 1988-1990, women with 6 or more de- 
pressive symptoms had a mean (± SD) functional status 
score of 5.2 ± 6.1 at follow-up, compared with 2.1 ± 4.3 
in women with 5 or fewer depressive symptoms (P(cid:44).001); 
those with 6 or more depressive symptoms were more 
likely to develop impaired functional status than those 
with 5 or fewer symptoms of depression (11% vs 3%; OR, 
3.6; 95% CI, 2.4-5.3; P(cid:44).001). When added to the model 
in Table 2, adjustment for functional status (as a con- 
tinuous variable) appeared to attenuate but not elimi- 
nate the association between depressive symptoms and 
mortality (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02-1.69; P = .03). 
Mortality rates in women with and without depres- 
sion did not appear to diverge until approximately 16 
months of follow-up (Figure 2). In models adjusted 
for the variables listed in Table 2, women with depres- 
sive symptoms had an 80% increased risk of cardiovas- 
cular death and an 80% increased risk of noncancer,

Why would women with depressive symptoms 
have increased mortality, and in particular increased 
cardiovascular mortality? Several possible mechanisms 
have been suggested. Electrocardiographic evidence of 
myocardial ischemia during daily life has been demon- 
strated in the hour following high levels of sadness, 
suggesting that myocardial ischemia may be a direct 
result of depressed mood.36 Depression has been iden- 
tified as a predictor of hypertension,37 autonomic dys- 
function as measured by higher plasma levels of nor- 
epinephrine and reduced heart rate variability,38-45 
noncardiovascular death, including a 3-fold increased 
risk of death from chronic obstructive pulmonary dis- 
ease, but no increased risk of death from cancer 
(Table 3). 

Elderly women with 6 or more depressive symptoms had 
a 47% increased adjusted risk of all-cause mortality, in- 
cluding an 80% increased risk of dying of cardiovascu- 
lar disease and noncancer, noncardiovascular disease, 
compared with women who reported 5 or fewer symp- 
toms of depression. This increased risk is similar to that 
conferred by other cardiovascular risk factors, such as 
hypertension, cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, obe- 
sity, and diabetes.35 Mortality increased with number of 
depressive symptoms, suggesting a dose-response rela- 
tionship. Increased mortality in women with depres- 
sion compared with women without depression did not 
occur until approximately 16 months of follow-up, in- 
dicating that depression is not simply a result of life- 
threatening conditions.

Decreased compliance with medications58 and lack of 
social support among patients with depressive symp- 
toms also may contribute to the association between 
depressive symptoms and mortality.59-61 
Another potential explanation is that the associa- 
tion between depressive symptoms and mortality may 
be partially confounded by impaired functional status. 
Our findings suggest that impaired functional status is 
both a cause and an effect of depression. To avoid over- 
adjusting for the effects of depression in our primary 
analysis, we adjusted for impaired functional status in 
a separate analysis and found that the association 
between depressive symptoms and mortality was some- 
what attenuated. We cannot determine whether this 
occurred because impaired functional status was a 
cause of depressive symptoms or a result of depressive 
symptoms that subsequently led to increased mortality. 
Depressive symptoms could be a marker of other 
illnesses that are associated with increased mortality. 
If a greater prevalence of other illnesses explained the 
association between depressive symptoms and mortal- 
ity, however, we would expect that mortality rates 
would diverge before 16 months of follow-up and that 
depressive symptoms also would be associated with 
increased cancer mortality. Prior studies62-64 have 
yielded conflicting results regarding the possibility 
that stressful life events and depression contribute to 
the onset and progression of cancer, particularly breast 
cancer. We found no increased risk of subsequent 
death from cancer among women with depressive 
symptoms. 
Our findings differ from those of 2 prior studies21,22 
that found no association between baseline depressive

events including myocardial infarction.6,11,22,24,49 Use of 
psychotropic medications, such as antidepressants, 
barbiturates, phenothiazines, and lithium, have been 
associated with mortality, although most likely as 
markers of depression rather than links in the pathway 
between depression and mortality.11,50 
We did not measure hyperlipidemia as a potential 
risk factor for cardiovascular mortality among women 
with depressive symptoms, but it is unlikely that hyper- 
lipidemia would explain the association between 
depressive symptoms and mortality because depression 
is probably associated with low rather than high choles- 
terol levels.51-53 Patients with depression are less likely 
than patients without depression to adhere to pre-

been associated with poor health outcomes.29,56,57 Our 
analysis adjusted for self-reported physical activity, 
but subsequent lack of exercise might have explained 
the association between depression and mortality.

symptoms and subsequent mortality. One study21 en- 
rolled members of a health maintenance organization who 
were younger than the participants in this study. The 
other22 enrolled patients with hypertension and found that, 
although baseline depressive symptoms were not asso- 
ciated with mortality, an increase in number of depres- 
sive symptoms over time was associated with increased 
mortality, including fatal stroke and fatal myocardial 
infarction. 
Several limitations deserve comment. First, only 
80% of survivors from the initial cohort completed the 
depression measure; women included in this analysis 
may have been less depressed than those who did not 
complete the depression measure. Second, although we 
measured many potential confounding variables, the 
association between depressive symptoms and mortality 
may be influenced by unmeasured variables, such as 
use of antidepressant medications or chronic medical 
illnesses that were not identified by self-report. Third, 
we measured depressive symptoms rather than per- 
forming a clinical interview for depression; thus, we 
must conclude that depressive symptoms, and not nec- 
essarily the diagnosis of depression, are associated with 
increased mortality. Fourth, cause of death may be mis- 
classified due to the potential inaccuracies of death cer- 
tificates. Finally, we studied only elderly white women, 
whose characteristics may differ from those of other 
populations. 

Depression is a common and readily treatable condition 
among older adults, but few receive appropriate treat- 
ment.65 Depressive symptoms are associated with 
increased cardiovascular and noncancer, noncardiovas- 
cular mortality in older women. Although the effect of 
treatment for depressive symptoms on mortality 
remains to be determined, these findings suggest that 
treatment for depression may not only enhance quality 
of life but also reduce mortality among women with 
depressive symptoms. We should redouble our efforts 
to improve detection and treatment of depression.
