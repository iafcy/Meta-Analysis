Background: Subclinical depression, often clinically un- 
recognized, may pose increased risk of cardiovascular dis- 
ease. Few studies have prospectively investigated car- 
diovascular events related to depression in older women. 
We describe prevalence, cardiovascular correlates, and 
relationship to subsequent cardiovascular events of de- 
pressive symptoms among generally healthy postmeno- 
pausal women. 
Methods: The Women’s Health Initiative Observa- 
tional Study followed up 93676 women for an average 
of 4.1 years. Depression was measured at baseline with 
a short form of the Center for Epidemiological Studies 
Depression Scale. Risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
events were estimated from Cox proportional hazards 
models adjusting for multiple demographic, clinical, and 
risk factor covariates. 
pression was significantly related to CVD risk and comor- 
bidity (odds ratios ranging from 1.12 for hypertension to 
1.60 for history of stroke or angina). Among women with 
no history of CVD, depression was an independent pre- 
dictor of CVD death (relative risk, 1.50) and all-cause mor- 
tality (relative risk, 1.32) after adjustment for age, race, edu- 
cation, income, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, high 
cholesterol level requiring medication, body mass index, 
and physical activity. Taking antidepressant medications 
did not alter the depression-associated risks associated. 
Conclusions: A large proportion of older women re- 
port levels of depressive symptoms that are significantly 
related to increased risk of CVD death and all-cause mor- 
tality, even after controlling for established CVD risk fac- 
tors. Whether early recognition and treatment of sub- 
clinical depression will lower CVD risk remains to be 
determined in clinical trials. 
Results: Current depressive symptoms above the screen- 
ing cutoff point were reported by 15.8% of women. De- 


cluding those that do not 
in themselves constitute 
clinical depression, have 
been reported to be inde- 
pendent risk factors for cardiovascular mor- 
tality in many studies,1-5 although not all,6 
and an increase in such symptoms may be 
an early warning sign of impending events.7 
The association between emerging depres- 
sive symptoms over time and cardiovascu- 
lar events raises several interpretive possi- 
bilities: increasing depression may be the 
cause of the cardiovascular event; or an im- 
pending cardiovascular event may be re- 
sponsible for subclinical symptoms, one 
manifestation of which is increasing de- 
pression; or some third unknown set of fac- 
tors might account for both the event and 
the depressive symptoms. It is not known 
whether depression acts through its ef- 
fects on cardiovascular risk factors or 
whether it is independently related to car- 
diovascular events. 
This article describes prevalence, car- 
diovascular correlates, and relationship to 
subsequent cardiovascular events of de- 
pression measured on a screening instru- 
ment, among a multiethnic cohort of 
nearly 100 000 generally healthy post- 
menopausal women enrolled in the 40 
centers of the Women’s Health Initiative 
Observational Study (WHI-OS).8 The 
WHI-OS is a long-term prospective co- 
hort study to identify and assess the im- 
pact of biological, lifestyle, biochemical, 
and genetic factors for the risk of heart dis- 
ease, cancer, osteoporosis, and other ma- 
jor health problems of older women. The 
findings reported herein pertain to women 
enrolled throughout the period from Sep- 
tember 1993 through December 1998 and 
represent the largest cohort of older 
women providing data on cardiovascular 
correlates of depression and on a prospec- 
tive investigation of depression as an in- 
dependent risk factor for subsequent car- 
diovascular events.

The WHI-OS cohort of 93676 participants is multiethnic, with 
0.5% American Indian–Alaskan Native, 8.2% African Ameri- 
can, 2.9% Asian–Pacific Islander, 3.9% Hispanic, 83.3% white, 
and 1.4% unknown. Postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years 
who gave written informed consent were recruited into the WHI 
at 40 clinical centers in the United States, mostly through mass 
mailings to age-eligible women from large mailing lists. De- 
tails of the WHI design are reported elsewhere.8 Exclusions were 
participation in other randomized trials, predicted survival of 
less than 3 years, alcoholism, drug dependency, diagnosed men- 
tal illness, dementia, or other conditions making women un- 
able to participate in the study. 

Depressive symptoms in the past week were assessed with a 
scale that used 6 items from the 20-item Center for Epidemio- 
logical Studies Depression Scale (CES-D),8-11 which is com- 
monly used in epidemiologic studies,12 and 2 items from the 
Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS).13 For the CES-D, partici- 
pants are asked how often they have felt each of the feelings 
listed below during the past week. Each item is scored as 0 (rarely 
or none of the time [(cid:1)1 day]), 1 (some or a little of the time 
[1-2 days]), 2 (occasionally or a moderate amount of the time 
[3-4 days]), or 3 (most or all of the time [5-7 days]). 
1. You felt depressed. 
2. Your sleep was restless. 
3. You enjoyed life (reversed scoring). 
4. You had crying spells. 
5. You felt sad. 
6. You felt that people disliked you. 

1. In the past year, have you had 2 weeks or more during 
which you felt sad, blue, or depressed or lost pleasure in things 
that you usually cared about or enjoyed? (0, no; 1, yes) 
2. Have you had 2 years or more in your life when you 
felt depressed or sad most days, even if you felt okay some- 
times? (0, no; 1, yes) If yes, have you felt depressed or sad much 
of the time in the past year? (0, no; 1, yes) 
These items were administered at baseline as part of an 
extensive behavioral and psychosocial questionnaire to all 
women enrolling in the WHI and were originally selected for 
this questionnaire because they are used in a logistic regres- 
sion equation14 for a depression-screening algorithm devel- 
oped by Burnam and colleagues.14 In this report, we have cho- 
sen to use only the 6 CES-D items as an index of current 
depression, rather than the algorithm, because the CES-D is com- 
monly used in epidemiologic studies and will make our re- 
sults comparable with those of other surveys. The 2 DIS items, 
which ask about feelings of sadness or depression for 2 or more 
weeks in the past year and feelings of sadness on most days for 
2 or more years, are stem questions for major depression and 
for dysthymia, respectively.13 We combined the 2 DIS items sepa- 
rately, so that a person responding “yes” to both items was clas- 
sified as having “history of depression.” 
The 6 CES-D items have been found to correlate with the 
full 20-item scale with r=0.88 (unpublished data, available from 
S.W.-S., 2000), in a population similar to that of the WHI, con- 
sisting of 2682 women aged 60 to 79 years who were partici- 
pants in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program 
(SHEP).15 The distribution of CES-D scores is skewed, and a 
common cutoff point of the full 20-item CES-D in screening 
for depression is a score of 16 or greater7,9,10 of a possible maxi- 
mum score of 60. In the short-form CES-D used here, we use 
a cutoff point of 5 (of a possible 18), which corresponds to the 
cutoff point of 16 on the full scale. In the SHEP sample, there 
was 95% agreement in classification as depressed with the cut- 
off point of 16 or greater on the 20-item scale and with the cut- 
off point of 5 or greater on the 6-item short scale. This is a screen- 
ing instrument, which may also reflect anxiety or psychological 
distress, and if used clinically, persons with CES-D above the 
cutoff point would generally be referred for further psychiat- 
ric evaluation. Thus, the screening result does not in itself con- 
stitute clinical depression. For notational convenience, in this 
report we use the term current depression for women who have 
a score of 5 or more on the short form of the CES-D. 
Treatment for depression was determined from medica- 
tions. Women were asked to bring in their original pill bottles 
to the baseline visit, and the label information was entered into 
the pharmacy database (Master Drug Data Base; Medi-Span, In- 
dianapolis, Ind). Antidepressants included treatment with mono- 
amine oxidase inhibitors, modified cyclics, selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic agents, and any other mis- 
cellaneous medications classified as antidepressants. 
Hypertensive subjects were defined as those who had el- 
evated blood pressure at the baseline clinic visit (systolic blood 
pressure (cid:2)140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (cid:2)90 mm 
Hg) and/or self-reported that they were taking medications for 
hypertension. Treated hypertensive subjects were those among 
the hypertensive individuals who reported that they were tak- 
ing pills for high blood pressure. All women were asked to bring 
all the prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs and 
supplements they were taking to the baseline visit. Self-report 
of taking antihypertensive medication was confirmed for 85% 
of women by the medications they brought in that fell into the 
antihypertensive drug categories. 
History of various CVD events was obtained by self- 
report on baseline questionnaires. Height, weight, and blood 
pressure were measured at the baseline visit. High cholesterol 
level was defined as self-report of having a high cholesterol level 
requiring pills; we did not have blood measures of cholesterol 
in the entire WHI-OS cohort. Overweight was defined as body 
mass index (BMI) greater than 27.3 (measured as weight in ki- 
lograms divided by the square of height in meters). Physical 
activity was assessed by questions ascertaining episodes per 
week of moderate or strenuous activity (defined by a meta- 
bolic equivalent score of at least 4.0 as indicated by Ainsworth 
and colleagues16) of at least 20 minutes’ duration. One meta- 
bolic equivalent is the amount of energy expended sitting qui- 
etly at rest, adjusted to body weight, equal to 1 kcal/kg per 
hour. Women reporting some recreational activity but of 
shorter duration and/or lesser intensity were classified as hav- 
ing “some activity.” 

Potential outcomes were identified from annual Medical His- 
tory Update questionnaires, or participant or third-party re- 
ports directly to clinic staff in the intervals between question- 
naires, followed by obtaining medical record information. 
Participant fatalities were identified through communication 
with proxy respondents and also through the National Death 
Index searches. Vital status was available for 98.2% of respon- 
dents as of February 28, 2001. Packets of complete informa- 
tion were prepared and presented to physician adjudicators at 
the clinical sites who made the decision on cause of event. End 
points were the first occurrence of the following: congestive 
heart failure; coronary heart disease (CHD), defined as fatal or 
nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI); coronary artery disease,

defined as MI or coronary death, angina, coronary artery by- 
pass grafting, or angioplasty; stroke, fatal or nonfatal; and CVD 
death, defined as death caused by definite or possible CHD, cere- 
brovascular disease, pulmonary embolism, or other or un- 
known type of CVD. Follow-up was on average 4.1 years (SD, 
1.2 years; interquartile range, 3.0-4.9 years; maximum fol- 
low-up time, 6.9 years). 

Prevalence of depression and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
are presented for demographic subgroups. Logistic regression 
models were run with baseline depression as the dependent 
variable, to determine odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for 
lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors, and for history of 
cardiovascular conditions. Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
were obtained for stroke, cardiovascular death, and all-cause 
mortality. 
To determine the effect of depression on subsequent car- 
diovascular events, Cox proportional hazards models were 
run to obtain relative risks (RRs) of CVD end points associ- 
ated with depression, controlling for age, race, education, 
income. Additional models were run, further controlling for 
variables significantly related to depression and known to be 
related to CVD outcomes: diabetes, hypertension, smoking, 
high cholesterol level requiring medications, BMI, physical 
activity, and hormone use. Some models also included use of 
antidepressant medications. We did not include in these mul- 
tivariate analyses variables that are presumed from past expe- 
rience to be collinear or intermediate in the pathway relating 
depression to CVD events, such as self-reported health, dis- 
ability, or alcohol use (which has a U-shaped relationship 
with some cardiovascular events), as control for such vari- 
ables may distort the effect estimates of depression. The objec- 
tive of these analyses was to see whether effects of depression 
on CVD end points remained after accounting for the estab- 
lished risk factors. 
Models were run separately for those with and without his- 
tory of CVD. Depression in the Cox models was defined as cur- 
rent or history of depression. The reference group was char- 
acterized by not being currently above the cutoff score of 5 or 
more on the CES-D 6-item screen and not having a history of 
depression at baseline as measured by the 2 DIS items. For events 
that were significantly related to depression in these analyses, 
models were also run excluding events in the first 6 months 
after baseline measure of depression. In some analyses, where 
specified, depression was defined as current or history of de- 
pression or taking antidepressant medication. 


Overall, 15.8% (95% CI, 15.6%-16.0%) of women re- 
ported current depressed mood at baseline (Table 1) 
and 12.3% (95% CI, 12.1-12.5) reported history of de- 
pressed mood.

Rates of depression were highest among Hispanic 
and American Indian–Alaskan Native women and low- 
est among Asian–Pacific Islanders. There was an in- 
verse dose-response relationship of depression to age, edu- 
cation (ranging from 12.7% for current depression of those 
with a college degree or higher to 29.9% of those with 
less than an eighth grade education), and income. His- 
tory of depression followed the same pattern. The re- 
sults that follow pertain to baseline current depressed 
mood unless otherwise noted. 
DEPRESSION AND CARDIOVASCULAR 
RISK FACTORS 
Lifestyle cardiovascular risk and protective factors were 
all related to current depression (Table 2) at baseline 
after adjustment for age, race, education, and income. Both 
being overweight and smoking were significantly re- 
lated to depression. Compared with nonoverweight non- 
smokers, those both overweight and currently smoking 
had 1.56 times the risk of current depression (95% CI, 
1.39-1.75). 
There was an inverse dose-response relationship of 
depression and exercise level, which, compared with non- 
exercisers, ranged from only 0.56 the risk among those 
who had 4 or more episodes of moderate or strenuous 
activity of at least 20 minutes’ duration, to 0.67 for those 
with 2 to 4 such episodes and 0.78 for those who re- 
ported some activity. The CIs did not overlap. The same 
relationships held true for history of depression. All of 
these ORs for cardiovascular lifestyle risk factors re- 
mained substantially unchanged when further adjusted 
for diabetes, arthritis, and history of CVD. Neverthe- 
less, self-reported fair or poor health, compared with ex- 
cellent or very good health, was strongly associated with 
depression (OR, 4.73) (data not shown). 
Compared with no medication use, current unop- 
posed estrogen use was associated with a greater risk of 
current depression (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.18-1.32) as was 
use of estrogen plus progesterone (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 
1.00-1.74). Since unopposed estrogen is most often used 
in women who have had a hysterectomy, the higher risk 
of depression among these women may be partly asso- 
ciated with the hysterectomy. Therefore, we compared 
logistic regressions for women with a uterus and with- 
out a uterus separately (data not displayed). The OR for 
depression in women using unopposed estrogen who had 
a uterus was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.11-1.54), and for those with- 
out a uterus it was 1.17 (95% CI, 1.07-1.28). 
Comorbid cardiovascular risk factors, adjusted for 
age, race, education, and income, were all significantly 
related to reported depression, ranging from OR of 1.12 
for hypertensive subjects compared with normotensive 
individuals to an OR of 1.50 for individuals with con- 
firmed diabetes (ie, those being treated for diabetes with 
pills or shots) compared with nondiabetic subjects. His- 
tory of various forms of CVD was strongly associated with 
risk of depression (Table 3). Women with a history of 
angina were 57% more likely to report current depres- 
sion than those without a history of CVD. Higher ORs 
for depression were also found for those with a history 
of MI (OR, 1.45), stroke (OR, 1.60), atrial fibrillation (OR,

specific to CVD conditions, we also looked at cancer and 
at stomach or duodenal ulcer and depression (not 
displayed). The OR for current depression among those with 
a history of cancer vs no cancer was 1.14 (95% CI, 
1.08-1.21). The OR for current depression and history of 
stomach or duodenal ulcer was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.42-1.62). 
This suggests that history of various morbidities may lead 
to reported current depression. 
TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION 
AND CRUDE EVENT RATES 
Of the entire cohort, 7.7% (95% CI, 7.5%-7.8%) were tak- 
ing antidepressive medications. Of the 14764 women who 
were above the cutoff point for depression on the 6-item 
CES-D screen, 14.7% (95% CI, 14.2%-15.3%) were tak- 
ing these drugs compared with 6.3% of those who did not 
meet the cutoff point for depression on the CES-D screen. 
Of the 7043 women taking antidepressant medications, 
49.9% were taking SSRIs (data not displayed). Table 4 
shows the crude event rates for those with current depres- 
sion or a history of depression and for those not de- 
pressed. For each event except cancer, the unadjusted rates 
were higher for those depressed than for those not de- 
pressed. 
The Figure displays Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
for those depressed and not depressed for the entire co- 
hort. For stroke the curves begin to diverge after about 
1 year, for cardiovascular death after about 6 months, and 
for all-cause mortality before 6 months. The curves, par- 
ticularly of cardiovascular deaths, become more sepa- 
rate over time, indicating that the effect of depression is 
not just immediately after the baseline measurement. 
PROSPECTIVE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR 
END POINTS IN RELATION 
TO BASELINE DEPRESSION 
To determine whether depression is an independent pre- 
dictor of cardiovascular events, we ran Cox propor- 
tional hazards models to obtain RRs of these events for 
those who reported depressive symptoms at baseline 
(score (cid:2)5 on CES-D items or reporting history of de- 
pressed mood). The reference group consisted of those 
neither depressed at baseline nor reporting history of de- 
pressed mood on the screening instrument. Because the 
interaction between history of CVD and depression was 
significant in models on coronary disease, and because 
a history of CVD may cause depression, we considered 
those without and with history of CVD separately 
(n=73098 and 18 572, respectively) (Table 5). 
Among women with no history of CVD, baseline de- 
pression adjusted for age and race was associated with a 
58% higher risk of CVD death (RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 
1.19-2.10). The association remained significant after ad- 
ditional adjustment for education and income (RR, 1.52; 
95% CI, 1.13-2.05). Further adjustment for diabetes, hy- 
pertension, smoking, and high cholesterol level requir- 



ing medications, BMI, physical activity, and hormone use 
did not affect the RR (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.10-2.03), in- 
dicating that the traditional risk factors do not account 
for the association of depression with cardiovascular death 
among those with no history of CVD at baseline. Cen- 
soring events that occurred in the first 6 months after the 
baseline measure of depression also did not affect the risk 
(RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.12-2.10). In models additionally ad- 
justing for being treated for depression, the RR was es- 
sentially unchanged (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.03-1.91; not 
displayed). For comparison purposes, in these models 
the adjusted RR of CVD death for hypertension was 2.19 
(95% CI, 1.64-2.93); for diabetes, 2.54 (95% CI, 1.60- 
4.03); and for current smoking, 3.66 (95% CI, 2.39- 
5.62); adjusted RRs were not significant for BMI, in- 
come, education, race, or ethnicity (data not shown). 
Depression, controlling for the multiple covari- 
ates, was also independently associated with all-cause mor- 
tality (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.16-1.52). In models where the 
definition of depression also included those taking an- 
tidepressant medications, even if their current depres- 
sive symptoms were below the cutoff point, controlling 
for age, race, and the CVD risk factors, the risks were simi- 
lar for cardiovascular death (RR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.23- 
2.13) and for all-cause mortality (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.18- 
1.51) (data not displayed). 
The RR for coronary disease of baseline depres- 
sion, adjusted for age and race, education income, dia- 
betes, hypertension, smoking, high cholesterol level re- 
quiring medications, BMI, physical activity, and hormone 
use, was elevated but lower than for mortality outcomes 
(RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.97-1.29). Additionally adjusting for 
taking antidepressant medication did not affect this risk 
estimate (RR, 1.11). For these end points, the estab-

tively who had baseline measures of depression and rig- 
orously adjudicated outcome events. Our major findings 
are that (1) prevalence of depressive symptoms on a 
screening instrument is quite high, at 16%; (2) depres- 
sion is significantly related to risk factors for CVD and 
history of cardiovascular morbidity; and (3) among those 
with no previous CVD, depression is an independent pre- 
dictor of CVD and all-cause mortality. For those with a 
history of CVD, baseline depressive symptoms are sig- 
nificantly associated with stroke. 
In the WHI, the 15.8% prevalence of reported 
depressive symptoms on a short form of the CES-D 
among women aged 50 to 79 years is within the range 
of 5% to 30% prevalence of possible depression, de- 
pending on age-sex-race groups, found in several other 
studies.17-20 Hispanic and American Indian–Alaskan Na- 
tive women had the highest rates of depression, while 
Asian–Pacific Islanders had the lowest rates, similar to 
other studies.7,18,21 
We found that older women with established risk 
factors for CVD, such as smoking, obesity, low physical 
activity, hypertension, high cholesterol level, and diabe- 
tes, had an approximately 20% to 50% higher OR for cur- 
rent depression after adjustment for age, race, educa- 
tion, and income. Low income (adjusting for age, race, 
and education) and low educational level (adjusting for 
age, race, and income) were highly related to depres- 
sion, but in our cohort they were not related to cardio- 
vascular end points after adjustment for other risk fac- 
tors. Similarly, women who have a history of various forms 
of CVD, such as angina, MI, revascularization, or stroke, 
also have higher odds of current depression. However, 
women with a history of cancer or ulcer also have higher 
risk of current depression, suggesting that several chronic 
disease conditions may lead to depressive symptoms. 
Compared with women who reported their health to be 
excellent, women who reported their health as being fair 
or poor were 4.8 times as likely to report depression (38% 
of them reported depression) as were those who re- 
ported their health as excellent (10%) (data not displayed). 
It is important to note that persons with diagnosed 
mental illness were excluded from the WHI; therefore, 
the depression index used herein assesses subclinical de- 
pressive symptoms. We have found, in an average of 4.1 
years of follow-up, that such symptoms are significant

lished risk factors did not explain the elevated risks as- 
sociated with depression. 
For those who had a history of CVD, depression 
(controlling for age and race, education, and income) was 
independently and significantly associated with conges- 
tive heart failure, stroke, CVD death, and all-cause mor- 
tality; however, with adjustment for multiple risk fac- 
tors, these RRs were reduced and depression remained 
significantly and independently related only to stroke (RR, 
1.45; 95% CI, 1.11-1.90), even when events in the first 
6 months were excluded (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.05-1.87). 
For models that indicated a significant relationship of de- 
pression and the event after controlling for all the co- 
variates noted above, interactions were examined be- 
tween depression and the known risk factors; none was 
significant at the .01 level (which was selected to adjust 
for multiple testing). In contrast to CVD events, depres- 
sion did not predict cancer incidence or death, either for 
those with or without a history of CVD, either with ad- 
justment for age, race, education, and income or with full 
adjustment.

independent predictors of CVD events. Because CVD may 
be a cause of depression, and because several studies have 
found that post-MI depression carries a poorer progno- 
sis than that for patients after MI who are not de- 
pressed,22 we performed separate analyses for women who 
had no history of CVD. It should be noted, however, that 
we cannot completely rule out the possibility that even 
among those with no history of CVD, undetected CVD 
may have caused depression. 
Other smaller studies have reported results similar 
to ours.23 In the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures of 7518 
white women aged 67 years or older with a 6-year follow- 
up, the investigators found an 80% higher risk associ- 
ated with depression for cardiovascular deaths after ad- 
justment for multiple covariates, but found no association 
with deaths from cancer.23 In our study of 93726 women, 
we found a 50% increased risk of CVD deaths associ- 
ated with depression among women with no previous 
CVD, and we also found no association with cancer in- 
cidence or deaths, although a Finnish study24 did find a 
higher risk of lung cancer associated with depression. The 
Glostrup study from Denmark25 followed up 409 men and 
321 women for 27 years and found that a 2-SD differ- 
ence in depression scores measured at baseline was as- 
sociated with a 71% increase in MI and a 59% increase 
in deaths from all causes, with no difference in effect sizes 
for men and women. The long-lasting nature of this effect 
suggested to the authors that this risk factor represents 
a chronic psychological characteristic. 
Four large prospective studies that used the CES-D, 
which was the measure of depression used in the WHI, 
looked at the association of heart disease and depres- 
sion: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur- 
vey,26 the Cardiovascular Health Study,27 the Estab- 
lished Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the 
Elderly,28 and the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly 
Program.29 
In the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey I, 5007 women and 2886 men recruited from 1982 
through 1984 were studied for CHD through 1992 and 
were free of CHD at baseline.26 The adjusted RRs, from 
Cox proportional hazards models, for all nonfatal CHD 
events were similar in women (RR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.11- 
2.68) and in men (RR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.14-2.56). How- 
ever, for fatal CHD events it was 0.74 (0.40-1.48) and 
2.34 (1.54-3.56), respectively, for women and men. 
In the Cardiovascular Health Study,27 5888 men and 
women older than 65 years were recruited and followed 
up for 6 years, of whom 4493 were free of known heart 
disease at baseline. The investigators found that for ev- 
ery 5-units-higher mean depression score on the CES-D, 
after adjustment for multiple covariates, the hazard ra- 
tios for CHD and all-cause mortality were 1.15 and 1.16, 
respectively (P=.006). There was no interaction with sex. 
The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, a clini- 
cal trial of antihypertensive therapy in 4367 generally 
healthy men and women 60 years or older, with an av- 
erage follow-up of 4.5 years, found that a 5-point in-

crease in CES-D during the trial significantly increased 
risk of stroke or MI (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.08-1.30), after 
excluding those with events during the first 6 months 
and controlling for multiple covariates. Increase in CES-D 
score was an independent predictor of death, stroke, or 
MI in both placebo and drug-treated groups.7 
However, data from the Established Populations for 
Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly longitudinal study28 
of 4162 men and women 65 years or older at baseline 
found that after adjustment for multiple covariates, CES-D 
depression was not associated with mortality in either sex, 
although it was significantly and directly associated in 
analyses without control for other variables, but sub- 
threshold depression was negatively related to mortal- 
ity in women but not men. It is difficult to compare these 
results with ours because the definition of subthreshold 
depression used in that report may not be equivalent to 
what we label as subclinical depression. The subthresh- 
old depression was based on number rather than sever- 
ity of symptoms, and we used a different cutoff point. It 
is also possible that differences in control variables used 
in the 2 studies may have resulted in different effect es- 
timates. In contrast, another 7-year prospective study of 
2558 individuals 65 years or older, reported by Unutzer 
and colleagues,30 showed that mild to moderate base- 
line depression did not have an effect on mortality, but 
more severe depressive symptoms were associated with 
significant increases in mortality. Thus, these studies show 
somewhat inconsistent results, with the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey indicating no effect 
of CES-D score on subsequent fatal CHD events in women 
and a large effect in men, the Cardiovascular Health Study 
showing modest effects on CVD events in women, and 
Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the 
Elderly showing no effect of higher depression scores on 
mortality, but an inverse effect for subthreshold depres- 
sion in women. 
In our study, where the follow-up was for an aver- 
age of 4.1 years and which is substantially larger than other 
prospective studies to date (N=93676), the adjusted RR 
for all-cause mortality was 1.32 and for CVD deaths was 
1.50 among those with no history of CVD, substantially 
higher than in the Cardiovascular Health Study. While 
there are somewhat inconsistent results across studies, 
partly due to different cutoff points in depression mea- 
sures and possibly to differences in population charac- 
teristics, the weight of the overall evidence seems to show 
that subclinical depression increases risk of subsequent 
morbidity and mortality, and our study supports that con- 
clusion. 
Given the mounting evidence that depression is an 
independent risk factor for cardiovascular events in those 
both with and without a history of CVD, there is grow- 
ing interest in whether treatment of depression may lower 
risk. There is also growing interest in identifying de- 
pression in a primary care setting.31 The suggestion that 
SSRIs may confer a protective effect against MI comes from 
a report by Sauer and colleagues32 of a case-control study 
in 30- to 65-year-old smokers of 653 cases of first MI and 
2990 controls. The investigators found an OR of 0.35 
among current SSRI users compared with nonusers af- 
ter adjustment for multiple covariates. The Enhancing

Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease Study, whose ob- 
jective was to determine the effect of treatment for de- 
pression and social support with cognitive behavioral 
therapy and SSRIs33 on subsequent morbidity and mor- 
tality in patients after MI (N=2481), has reported no effect 
on event-free survival. There have been no clinical trials 
addressing this issue in women with no history of heart 
disease. In our prospective analyses, controlling for use 
of antidepressants did not alter the RRs of subsequent 
events associated with baseline depression. It is possible 
that women who report depressive symptoms are less ad- 
herent to medications for other cardiovascular risk fac- 
tors, which then puts them at greater risk of CVD events. 
We controlled for baseline risk factor status and life- 
style variables that affected CVD risk in our analyses, but 
had no measures of adherence to medications. 
Various biological mechanisms have been sug- 
gested to link depression and depressive symptoms to CHD. 
Two main avenues are through the effects of depression 
on lipid metabolism and through altered sympathetic 
arousal in depressed patients.34,35 Mechanisms of in- 
creased risk of death in patients with depression after MI 
may include arrhythmia.36,37 Alteration in the ratio be- 
tween sympathetic and parasympathetic tone may make 
patients more susceptible to arrhythmia by lowering the 
threshold for ventricular fibrillation.38,39 Increased plate- 
let aggregation may also be a contributory factor.40 An- 
other mechanism that is gaining attention is an inflam- 
matory process. High C-reactive protein level, which is a 
marker of inflammation, has been found to be predictive 
of CVD41 and possibly may be related to depression. A study 
from Germany by Rothermundt and colleagues42 failed to 
support the hypothesis that major depression is associ- 
ated with global inflammation as measured by C-reactive 
protein, although patients with one type of depression (non- 
melancholic) did show higher levels of C-reactive pro- 
tein than healthy controls. This is an area that merits fur- 
ther investigation. 
In conclusion, we have found, in the largest multi- 
ethnic volunteer cohort of older women to date, that sub- 
clinical depression is a prevalent condition that is re- 
lated to cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular 
comorbidity. It is an independent risk factor for subse- 
quent cardiovascular death, particularly in those who have 
no history of CVD, at a lower level than diabetes or hy- 
pertension and at a higher level than BMI, income, edu- 
cation, race, or ethnicity. Whether treatment with anti- 
depressants of those with no history of CVD will lower 
the risks remains to be determined in a randomized clini- 
cal trial of this question.

“Updating the Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in 
Older Adults,” published in the December 8/22 issue of the ARCHIVES (2003; 
163:2716-2724), an error occurred in the “Results” section on page 2720. The 
second full sentence in the left column should have read “Reserpine was changed 
to be avoided only at doses greater than 0.25 mg, and disopyramide phosphate 
avoidance now only refers to the non–extended release formulation.” This cor-
