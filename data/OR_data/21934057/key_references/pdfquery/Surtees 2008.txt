Psychological distress, major depressive 
disorder, and risk of stroke 

Background: Studies have suggested that mood status is associated with an increased risk of 
stroke, though mostly based on measures of depression defined by symptoms alone rather than 
diagnostic criteria representative of clinically important distress and impairment. We investigated 
this association based upon a large population-based prospective cohort study. 
Methods: Baseline assessment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and of mental health well- 
being (defined by the Mental Health Inventory, MHI-5) was completed by 20,627 stroke-free 
participants, aged 41 to 80 years, in the United Kingdom European Prospective Investigation into 
Cancer–Norfolk study. 
Results: During 8.5 years of follow-up, 595 incident (fatal and nonfatal) stroke endpoints were 
recorded. Neither past year nor lifetime MDD was associated with stroke. A one SD decrease in 
MHI-5 scale score (representing greater emotional distress) was associated with an 11% in- 
creased risk of stroke after adjustment for age, sex, cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, 
cholesterol, obesity, preexisting myocardial infarction, diabetes, social class, education, hyper- 
tension treatment, family history of stroke, and antidepressant medication use (hazard ratio 1.11, 
95% CI 1.00 to 1.22). This association was consistent for men and for women, for fatal and 
nonfatal stroke, and conformed to a dose-response relationship. 
Conclusions: Findings from this large prospective cohort study suggest that increased psycholog- 
ical distress is associated with elevated stroke risk. Episodic major depressive disorder was not 
associated with incident stroke in this study. Neurology® 2008;70:788–794

During the past decade, research has focused on increasing understanding of the bidirec- 
tional association between depression and stroke. Results from stroke survivor,1,2 regis- 
ter,3 and population-based4 studies have suggested that depression commonly occurs 
following stroke, necessitates increased need for poststroke healthcare, is associated with 
an increased risk of suicide, particularly in women and in younger age groups, and fol- 
lowing control for vascular and other risk factors, is associated with increased stroke 
incidence. 
However, the evidence that depression may confer increased risk of incident stroke is 
controversial.5,6 This follows from study limitations imposed by cohort size and endpoint 
rarity,7,8 by restriction to special study groups,9 by limited capacity to adjust for stroke

risk factors,7,10 and in particular, by a near- 
universal reliance on general measures of 
mental health status defined by symptom 
count alone rather than by depressive dis- 
order diagnostic criteria that require recog- 
nition (for example) of evidence of a 
sustained period of clinically important 
distress and impairment.4,9,11,12 

To advance understanding of the ori- 
gin of the suggested association between 
depression and stroke, and to consider 
the clinical implications of such an asso- 
ciation, evidence is needed, based upon 
prospective 
large 
healthy (stroke-free) cohort studies, that 
include assessment of depressive disorder 
defined by diagnostic criteria. Based on 
data collected within the United King- 
dom European Prospective Investigation 
into Cancer (EPIC)–Norfolk population- 
based prospective cohort study,13 we 
evaluated the association between mea- 
sures of general mental health well-being 
and of depressive disorder and incident 
fatal and nonfatal stroke, independent of 
cerebrovascular risk factors, for both 
men and women. 


METHODS Participants and measures. Residents of 
Norfolk (UK) were recruited during 1993–1997 into the 
United Kingdom European Prospective Investigation into 
Cancer (EPIC)–Norfolk study using general practice age- 
sex registers.13 Baseline assessment included details of pre- 
existing physician diagnosed diabetes, myocardial 
infarction (MI), and stroke, cigarette smoking behavior, 
hypertension treatment, family history of stroke, educa- 
tion, and social class. Social class was classified according 
to the Registrar General’s occupation-based social classi- 
fication scheme, namely social class I (professionals), so- 
cial 
and technical 
(includes managerial 
occupations), social class III (subdivided into nonmanual 
and manual skilled workers), social class IV (partly skilled 
workers), and social class V (unskilled workers). A subse- 
quent health check attendance included assessment of sys- 
tolic blood pressure (SBP in mm Hg), based on the mean 
of two readings taken by trained nurses (after each study 
participant had been seated for 5 minutes), and body mass 
index (BMI), determined according to the Quetelet Index 
(weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). 
Non-fasting blood samples taken by venipuncture enabled 
estimation of serum total cholesterol using an RA 1000 
Technicon analyzer (Bayer Diagnostics, Basingstoke, 
UK). The study was approved by the Norwich District 
Health Authority Ethics Committee, and all participants 
gave signed informed consent. See references13,14 for fur- 
ther details of study design and participant assessments. 
During 1996 –2000 a total of 20,921 (of 28,582 eligible 
EPIC-Norfolk) participants, aged 41 to 80 years, completed 
the Health and Life Experiences Questionnaire (HLEQ), an 
assessment of psychosocial circumstances, that included a 
representation of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men- 
tal Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV)15 criteria for major de- 
pressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder 
(GAD). The assessment was designed to identify those par- 
ticipants thought likely to have met a putative diagnosis of 
MDD at any time in their lives. Where any episode was re- 
ported, participants were asked also to estimate onset and (if 
appropriate) offset timings. Twelve-month MDD and 12- 
month GAD were defined as any episode that was either 
current at HLEQ completion or ended within 1 year of ques- 
tionnaire assessment.16,17 The HLEQ also included a five- 
item version of the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5), with 
one or more items representing anxiety, depression, loss of 
behavioral/emotional control, and psychological well-being 
during the past 4 weeks, as part of a validated generic measure 
of subjective health status, the anglicized version of the Short 
Form 36 (SF-36).18 The MHI-5, originally developed as a mea- 
sure of well-being and psychological distress,19 has been shown 
to be an effective measure of depression severity,20-22 and to be a 
valid measure of MDD (among functionally impaired, 
community-dwelling elderly).23 Recent antidepressant medica- 
tion use was assessed through a questionnaire completed ap- 
proximately 6 months prior to the HLEQ. 
Participants with a history of stroke at EPIC baseline and 
those who were admitted to hospital with a stroke between 
EPIC baseline and HLEQ completion were excluded, leaving 
a sample 20,627 (of 20,921) HLEQ participants for analysis. 
Stroke morbidity and mortality among EPIC-Norfolk partic- 
ipants to July 31, 2006, was classified according to Interna- 
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) 
codes 430 – 438 or according to International Classification 
of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) as codes I60 –I69. At- 
tending physicians assigned diagnostic codes for stroke 
events resulting in hospital admission. Nonfatal stroke was 
defined as hospital admission due to stroke that did not re- 
sult in death (due to stroke in the same month), and any 
stroke was taken as the first occurrence of either hospital 
admission or death due to stroke. 
Statistical analysis. Analyses were implemented in Stata 
version 8.2.24 The associations among 12-month MDD, 
MHI-5, and any stroke, fatal stroke, and nonfatal stroke 
were investigated using Cox proportional hazards regres- 
sion. Results are presented by sex and for men and women 
combined as hazard ratios for 12-month MDD, and as haz- 
ard ratios for a 1 SDdecrease in MHI-5 score (representing 
greater psychological distress), with adjustment for age (in 5 
year bands) and sex, and subsequently for cigarette smoking 
(current, former, never), SBP (included as a continuous mea- 
sure), total cholesterol, obesity (BMI (cid:1) 30), preexisting MI, 
diabetes, social class (I, II, III nonmanual, III manual, IV, V), 
education (no qualifications, to age 16, to age 18, degree 
level), hypertension treatment (yes, no), family history of 
stroke (yes, no), and recent antidepressant medication use 
(yes, no). Sex differences were tested through inclusion of 
interaction terms. In addition, the presence of a dose- 
response relation between MHI-5 score and stroke was in- 
vestigated through inclusion of MHI-5 as a categorical 
variable recoded into quintiles (score ranges 0 to 63, 64 to 75, 
76 to 83, 84 to 91, 92 to 100).

sion treatment, and reported recent antidepres- 
sant medication use. Additionally, participants 
reported greater psychological distress (lower 
MHI-5 scores) if they had previously been diag- 
nosed with diabetes, had higher total blood cho- 
lesterol, or had a lower level of educational 
attainment. 
Table 3 shows that no association was ob- 
served between 12-month MDD and incident (fa- 
tal and nonfatal) stroke (hazard ratio 1.08 [95% 
CI 0.67, 1.75] after adjusting for age, sex, ciga- 
rette smoking, SBP, total cholesterol, obesity 
[BMI (cid:1) 30], preexisting MI, diabetes, social class, 
education, hypertension treatment, family history 
of stroke, and antidepressant medication use). In 
addition, no association was observed between 
lifetime MDD and (any fatal or nonfatal) stroke 
(hazard ratio 1.13 [95% CI 0.85, 1.50]), and no 
association was observed between either 12- 
month (0.81 [0.33, 1.98]) or lifetime GAD (0.58 
[0.27, 1.24]) and (any fatal or nonfatal) stroke, 
with all adjustments as above. 
Table 4 shows that a 1 SD decrease in MHI-5 
scale score (representing greater psychological 
distress) was associated with an 11% increased 
risk of incident stroke after adjusting for all risk 
factors (as above). This association was consis- 
tent for men and for women (p (cid:1) 0.46 for sex 
interaction), and was more pronounced for fatal 
than for nonfatal stroke endpoints. Figure 2 
shows that this association conformed to a dose- 
response relationship with the risk of stroke pro- 
gressively greater for participants reporting 
increased psychological distress. Table 5 shows 
that while the association between MHI-5 and 
stroke was strongest in the first 2 years of follow- 
RESULTS Of 20,627 study participants aged be- 
tween 41 and 80 years, 8,939 were men and 11,688 
were women. Of these 1,083 (5.3%) reported epi- 
sodes of MDD within 12 months of HLEQ assess- 
ment (336 [3.8%] for men and 747 [6.4%] for 
women, p (cid:2) 0.001 for test of difference by sex), 
and 3,184 (15.4%) reported episodes of MDD at 
any time in their lives (1,012 [11.3%] for men and 
2,172 [18.6%] for women, p (cid:2) 0.001). Mean 
MHI-5 score was 76.9 (SD (cid:1) 16.4), 78.9 (15.8) for 
men and 75.4 (16.6) for women (p (cid:2) 0.001 for test 
of difference by sex), and was 55.2 (20.3) for par- 
ticipants who reported an episode of MDD in the 
past 12 months, 76.5 (14.4) for those who re- 
ported episodes of MDD in their lifetime (that 
was not in the past 12 months), and 78.5 (15.2) for 
participants who reported no episodes of MDD at 
any time in their lives. During a total of 170,593 
(median 8.5) person-years of follow-up, 595 inci- 
dent stroke endpoints were recorded (277 among 
men and 318 among women). Of these, 167 were 
fatal and 491 were hospital admissions (with 63 
participants admitted to hospital and subse- 
quently dying from stroke). Figure 1 shows the 
distribution of MHI-5 scores, and table 1 shows 
the number and percentage of participants report- 
ing 12-month MDD according to stroke end- 
points. 
Table 2 shows prevalence rates of 12-month 
MDD and mean MHI-5 scores according to cere- 
brovascular risk factors and antidepressant medi- 
cation use. Twelve-month prevalence rates of 
MDD were higher and MHI-5 scores were lower 
(representing greater psychological distress) for 
younger than for older participants (both p (cid:2) 
0.0001). After adjusting for age and sex, rates of 
12-month MDD were higher and MHI-5 scores 
were lower (representing greater psychological 
distress) for participants who were current ciga- 
rette smokers, were obese, had previously had an 
MI, were of lower social class, reported hyperten-

DISCUSSION Based on data from 20,627 initially 
stroke-free participants in the EPIC-Norfolk 
study, we found no evidence that episodic mood 
state as defined by diagnostic criteria was associ- 
ated with incident stroke. In contrast, we found 
evidence that a more general measure of current 
mental health well-being was associated with in- 
creased risk of incident stroke in men and in 
women and independently of known cerebrovas- 
cular risk factors. This association conformed to 
a dose-response relation and did not attenuate 
with increasing length of follow-up. 
This large community-based population study 
has a number of strengths including prospective 
determination of endpoints through death certifi- 
cation and hospital record linkage for all study 
participants (with 167 fatal and 491 nonfatal 
strokes in 170,000 person-years of follow-up), 
availability of data for both men and for women, 
a measure of MDD defined according to core 
DSM-IV diagnostic criteria and a more general 
measure of mental health well-being, together 
with baseline assessments that allowed adjust- 
ment for a wide range of cerebrovascular risk fac- 
tors. 
However, the study has a number of important 
limitations. First, the restricted age range and 
characteristics of the cohort may reduce the gen- 
eralizability of findings. Participation in the study 
involved commitment to future collection of de- 
tailed biologic and dietary data. While this re- 
sulted in a cohort that included fewer current 
cigarette smokers than the general resident popu- 
lation of England, the sample was representative 
in terms of anthropometric variables, blood pres- 
sure and serum lipids,13 and in terms of physical 
and mental functional health.25 Secondly, given 
that health care systems vary in their use of inpa- 
tient services for the assessment and treatment of 
patients with stroke, and perhaps because these 
might vary most for less severe stroke,26 less se- 
vere stroke endpoints may have been underascer- 
tained through use only of data from death 
certificates and from hospital admissions. 
Limitations of measurement and of power 
should be taken into account when interpreting 
the finding of no association between episodic 
mood state and incident stroke in these data. The 
HLEQ structured self-assessment of MDD repre- 
sents a pragmatic solution to enabling such mea- 
sures to be included in a large-scale chronic

disease epidemiology setting. Previous work 
(based upon a subsample of these data) has 
shown DSM-IV MDD prevalence estimates and 
associated demographic risk profiles 
to be 
broadly similar to those derived from dedicated 
large-scale psychiatric epidemiology research 
studies.16 This study had 80% power (at the 5% 
level of significance) to detect a relative risk of 
magnitude 1.33 for lifetime and 1.53 for 12-month 
MDD. While this sample was large, with nearly 
600 stroke endpoints observed in over 8 years of 
(median) follow-up, the relatively low prevalence 
of the exposure variables limits the capacity of the 
current study to have detected associations of 
more modest magnitude. In addition, the poten- 
tial for differential recall bias arising from the re- 
quirement of a 4-week retrospective recall period 
for the MHI-5 vs 1-year and lifetime periods of 
recall for the MDD and GAD diagnostic modules 
may provide an alternative explanation to the 
negative findings observed in relation to these 
measures here. 
This community-based cohort study has been 
able to report associations between mental health 
status measures defined by a measure of psycho- 
logical distress (previously identified as an effec- 
tive screening instrument for mood disorders21), 
and by diagnostic criteria and incident (fatal and 
nonfatal) stroke. Our results are consistent with 
previous evidence, based upon a range of self-

increased risk of stroke but was limited by end- 
point rarity (66 self-reported strokes and 29 
stroke-related deaths during the follow-up), and 
by incomplete adjustment for cerebrovascular 
risk factors.7 A further registry study also re- 
ported evidence of association between patients 
admitted to hospital for depression and subse- 
quent stroke but was unable to adjust for relevant 
risk factors.10 While previous evidence has shown 
anxiety, including GAD, to be common in pa- 
tients for up to 3 years following stroke,27,28 the 
authors are unaware of any previous examination 
of the association between GAD and stroke inci- 
dence. Given that depression is commonly comor-

bid with anxiety,29 and that the MHI-5 includes a 
question concerned with current anxiety, our re- 
sults suggesting no association between GAD and 
incident stroke, though limited by power consid- 
erations, are of interest in aiding collective inter- 
pretation of these findings. 
Stroke is among the leading causes of long- 
term disability and death worldwide.30 While evi- 
dence, based upon the Framingham Study 
original and offspring cohorts, has reported de- 
creases in the incidence of stroke and athero- 
thrombotic brain infarction over the past 50 
years, achieved in part through improved risk fac- 
tor control, continued efforts are needed to iden- 
tify new risk factors that may aid primary 
prevention and reduce post-stroke disability and 
mortality.31 Our results respond to calls for work 
to aid insight into understanding the origin of the 
relationship between mood status and stroke 
risk.6 They focus attention on the conceptually 
more general nature of psychological distress and 
well-being, represented by the MHI-5, rather than 
the specific represented by MDD and GAD. 
However, limitations of statistical power in rela- 
tion to both the measures of MDD and GAD di- 
agnostic status warrant caution in discounting 
their respective association with incident stroke. 
In addition, difficulty in being able to demon- 
strate discontinuities or points of rarity between 
related psychiatric syndromes32 has remained a 
challenge in the specification of diagnostic crite- 
ria.33,34 It is possible that psychological distress, 
within a broader spectrum of mental health varia- 
tion, is part of a prolonged prodrome to stroke or 
that the association may be due to residual con- 
founding. Further work is needed to replicate 
these findings, to consider emotional health asso- 
ciations according to stroke subtypes, and to eval- 
uate potential mechanisms such as for example 
the debated association between homocysteine 
concentration and depression and stroke.35-37
