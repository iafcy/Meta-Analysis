Background The relationship between depression and cerebrovascular disease 
(CBVD) continues to be debated although little research has com- 
pared the predictive power of depression for coronary heart disease 
(CHD) with that for CBVD within the same population. This study 
aimed to compare the importance of depression for CHD and CBVD 
within the same population of adults free of apparent cardiovascu- 
lar disease. 


A random sample of 23 282 adults (9507 men, 13 775 women) aged 
20–54 years were followed up for 7 years. Fatal and first non-fatal 
CHD and CBVD events were documented by linkage to the 
National-hospital-discharge and mortality registers. 
Sex–age–education-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for CHD was 1.66 
[95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24–2.24] for participants with 
mild to severe depressive symptoms, i.e. those scoring 510 on the 
21-item Beck Depression Inventory, and 2.04 (1.27–3.27) for those 
who filled antidepressant prescriptions compared with those with- 
out depression markers in 1998, i.e. at study baseline. For CBVD, 
the corresponding HRs were 1.01 (0.67–1.53) and 1.77 (0.95–3.29). 
After adjustment for behavioural and biological risk factors these 
associations were reduced but remained evident 
the 
adjusted HRs being 1.47 (1.08–1.99) and 1.72 (1.06–2.77). For 
CBVD, the corresponding multivariable adjusted HRs were 0.87 
(0.57–1.32) and 1.52 (0.81–2.84). 

Conclusions Self-reported depression using a standardized questionnaire and 
clinical markers of mild to severe depression were associated with 
an increased risk for CHD. There was no clear evidence that depres- 
sion is a risk factor for CBVD, but this needs further confirmation. 




Introduction 
Cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart dis- 
ease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease (CBVD), is 
the leading cause of death, major morbidity and dis- 
ability in the world.1 Approximately 17.5 million 
people died from cardiovascular diseases in 2005, rep- 
resenting 30% of all deaths globally. 
Research has identified cigarette smoking, high alco- 
hol intake, high cholesterol levels, obesity, hyperten- 
sion, diabetes, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity 
as important risk factors for cardiovascular disease.2 
Findings from prospective studies using rigorous 
methods show that depression may also be a risk 
factor in the pathophysiological progression of cardio- 
vascular disease.3 Several recent studies provide com- 
pelling evidece showing depression to influence the 
onset and outcome of CHD, indicating that it may 
act as a distal risk factor and play a role in disease 
prognosis.4 Successive meta-analyses show depression 
to increase the risk for onset of CHD, with pooled 
relative risks between 1.6 and 1.8.5–7 

Although there appears to be a consensus on the 
remain 
depression–CHD link, more 
regarding the association between depression and 
CBVD. In fact, fewer studies have examined the asso- 
ciation between depression and the risk for the onset 
of CBVD, and the findings are inconsistent. Results 
from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area 
Study8 showed that individuals with a history of 
depressive symptoms had greater risk of 
fatal or 
self-reported stroke. 
In a small-scale study from 
Japan,9 depressive symptoms were associated with 
an increased incidence of stroke. Similar 
results 
have been obtained from Australian,10 Dutch11,12 
and Swedish1 studies on the elderly with or without 
accompanying cardiac disease. However, these find- 
ings are in contrast with previous14,15 and more 
recent16 findings showing that depressive symptoms 
are not associated with an increased risk of stroke in 
the elderly. Recent 
from the European 
findings 
Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk 
study17 also showed that major depressive disorders 
are not associated with incident stroke in a large 
sample of participants aged 41–80 years. 
In addition to these controversies, it is noteworthy 
that epidemiological studies examining the associa- 
tion between depression and cardiovascular disease 
typically use either CHD or CBVD as the outcome, 
rarely do they examine them both within the same 
population.3 This makes it difficult to compare the 
predictive power of depression for the two outcomes. 
Such comparison is important because differences in 
the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic lesions in coronary 
and cerebral arteries have been shown,18,19 even 
though CHD and CBVD are characterized by some 
common aspects and they share several risk factors. 
In this report from the Health and Social Support 
(HeSSup) study, we used prospective data from a 
large sample of the Finnish population to compare 
the importance of depression as a risk factor for 
CHD and CBVD within the same population. 
Methods 
Population 
The HeSSup study is a prospective cohort study on a 
population sample representative of 
the Finnish 
population of the following four age groups: 20–24, 
30–34, 40–44 and 50–54 years at baseline in 1998,20 a 
total of 10 628 men and 15 267 women. The Turku 
University 
Committee 
approved the study. 


Depression 
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered 
to all participants at baseline in 1998. The BDI21 is a 
21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that 
is one of the most widely used instruments for measur- 
ing the severity of depression. Each item requires a 
response on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 to 3 (total 
scores can range from 0 to 63). A score of 51021 is seen 
to separate those participants with subclinical mild to 
severe depression from those without depression. 

Prescriptions of antidepressant medications were 
used as a proxy to capture individuals who were 
more likely to have more severe depressive symptoms 
using data from the National Drug Prescription 
Register data. This register includes outpatient pre- 
scription data classified according to the World 
Health 
Therapeutic 
Chemical (ATC) classification code and tracks medi- 
cation purchased from all pharmacies in Finland. The 
personal 
identification numbers (a unique number 
assigned to each Finnish citizen) of participants 
were used to collect data on date of purchase of anti- 
depressants (ATC code N06A), bought on prescrip- 
tions that are written only by physicians in Finland. 
These data were drawn from the register for 1998, i.e. 
at study baseline, as were responses on the BDI. 

Follow-up of CHD and CBVD 
The personal 
identification number of participants 
was used to collect records of hospitalizations from 
the Finnish National Hospital discharge register and 
mortality records from the Statistics Finland register. 
These registers provide virtually complete hospital dis- 
charge and mortality data and the associated diagno- 
ses of fatal or non-fatal CHD or CBVD events. The 
the 
register data have been validated against 
population-based myocardial 
infarction register for 
classifying events using the 2003 American Heart 
Association definition.22 The follow-up for CHD and 
CBVD events involved extracting data on the date and 
cause of hospitalization and death for all participants 
who were treated in a hospital or died between 
1 January 1999 and 31 December 2005. Disease end- 
point, based on the main diagnoses, was determined 


by International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 
codes I20–I25 (CHD) and ICD-10 codes I60–I69 
(CBVD). 
Health status at baseline 
From the Drug Reimbursement Register, we identified 
all participants entitled to special reimbursements for 
medication to hypertension, diabetes and CHD in 
1998, i.e. at study baseline, and excluded from this 
study those with entitlements to special reimburse- 
ments for CHD. We also excluded all participants hos- 
pitalized for CHD or CBVD in 1998 using the National 
Hospital Discharge register. Thus, 
the remaining 
sample consisted of participants free of CHD and 
CBVD at baseline. Data on hypertension and diabetes 
were used as covariates. 


Covariates 
All background variables were measured at baseline: 
sex (male vs female), age groups (20–24, 30–34, 
40–44, 50–54 years) and education (basic, secondary, 
lower 
tertiary). We assessed four 
behaviour-related risk factors using standard ques- 
tionnaire measurements 
survey. 
Smoking status was measured with a dichotomous 
variable, which describes current regular smoking 
(never- or ex-smoker, current smoker, missing data). 
The participants reported their habitual frequency and 
the amount of beer, wine and spirits consumed. They 
were classified as having a high alcohol intake if their 
weekly consumption exceeded 16 drinks (200 g of 
alcohol) (No vs Yes). Body mass index (BMI), calcu- 
lated from self-reported weight and height, was used 
to measure obesity (BMI 5 30 vs <30 kg/m2). Physical 
activity was calculated using the metabolic equivalent 
task (MET) index to measure sedentary life style 
[<2 MET-hours (MET-h) per day] (No vs Yes). 
Statistical analysis 
Differences in CHD, CBVD and depression (defined as 
BDI score 510 or filling antidepressant prescriptions) 
as a function of sample characteristics were assessed 
using the chi-square test. We examined the relation- 
ships between depression and cardiovascular out- 
comes (CHD and CBVD events) using four serially 
adjusted Cox regression models. In model 1, depres- 
sion and sex, age and education were the sole inde- 
pendent variables. In model 2 and 3, the hazard ratios 
(HRs) were adjusted for behavioural (alcohol con- 
sumption, sedentary lifestyle and smoking) and bio- 
logical (obesity, hypertension or diabetes and incident 
CHD or CBVD) risk factors, respectively. In model 4, 
the HRs were simultaneously adjusted for all afore- 
mentioned covariates. In addition to these analyses, 
we examined the association between continuous BDI 
scores to determine the risk of CHD and CBVD asso- 
ciated with a 1-unit increase in BDI. There is no evi- 
dence of interactions between depression and sex in 
relation to CHD and CBVD status (P40.05), allowing 
us to combine men and women in the analyses. The 
assumption of proportional hazards assessed examin- 
interaction term between 
ing the time-dependent 
depression and logarithm of 
the follow-up period 
(time variable) held (all P40.05). 
Results 
Of the 25 895 respondents to the baseline survey in 
1998, 234 had moved abroad and could not be 
included in the follow-up. Data on CHD and CBVD 
were linked to survey responses from national health 
registers on the basis of a written consent from 24 128 
(93%) participants. A total of 23 282 participants with 
complete data on covariates were included in the 
analyses. A total of 203 incident CHD events (fatal 
or non-fatal ischaemic heart disease events) and 129 
incident CBVD events (fatal and non-fatal stroke 
events: 27 subarachnoid haemorrhages, 23 intracereb- 
ral haemorrhages, 55 cerebral 
infarction, 3 other 
non-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage, 19 other 
CBVDs, 2 sequelae of cerebral infarction) were docu- 
mented during the follow-up. 
Table 1 presents the differences in CHD, CBVD and 
depression as a function of baseline sample character- 
istics. CHD and CBVD events were higher in men, 
those with lower educational 
older participants, 
level, current smokers (not for CBVD), high-alcohol 
consumers, obese participants and those with a sed- 
entary life style and with hypertension or diabetes 
(P 4 0.026). Depression among participants at base- 
line (BDI score 510 or filling antidepressant prescrip- 
tions) was more likely among women, older people, 
those with a lower education, current smokers, high 
alcohol consumers, obese people, those more likely to 
have a sedentary life style and those with hyperten- 
sion or diabetes (P 4 0.01). 
Table 2 presents the associations between depression 
and subsequent CHD and CBVD events using Cox 
regression analysis. In model 1, when adjusted for 
socio-demographic variables, the HR for CHD was 
1.66 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.24–2.24] 
for participants with mild to severe depressive symp- 
toms and 2.04 (95% CI 1.27–3.27) for participants 
who filled antidepressant prescriptions when com- 
pared with those without depression markers. The 
risk of CHD for 1-unit increase in the score on the 
BDI (continuous variable) was 1.04 (95% CI 1.02– 
1.06). 
for 
the 
socio-demographic factors was 1.01 (95% CI 0.67– 
1.53) for participants with mild to severe depressive 
symptoms, 1.77 (95% CI 0.95–3.29) for those who 
filled antidepressant prescriptions and 1.01 (95% CI 
0.99–1.04) for 1-unit increase on the BDI (continuous 
variable). In models 2 and 3, adjusted for behavioural 
and biological risk factors respectively, these associa- 
tions were attenuated but the association between 
depression and CHD was robust to these adjustments.

In model 4, including simultaneously adjusted for all

CHD. For CBVD, these HRs were 0.87 (0.57–1.32) 
and 1.52 (0.81–2.84). 
Sensitivity analyses 
To test the robustness of our findings, we repeated the 
analyses excluding CHD and CBVD events that occurred 
in the first 2 years of follow-up. These analyses provided 
a similar pattern of associations as those presented in 
Table 2. For CHD, the number of events was reduced by 
31% (n ¼ 145), but the unadjusted HR for participants 
with mild to severe depression (BDI score 510) and for 
those who filled prescriptions for antidepressant drugs 
remained at 2.08 (P < 0.001) and 2.15 (P < 0.006) when 
compared with those who were not depressed. The cor- 
responding fully adjusted HRs were 1.94 (P < 0.001) 
and 2.00 (P ¼ 0.015). For CBVD, the number of events 
was reduced by 26% (n ¼ 97) and the corresponding 
unadjusted HRs were 1.03 (P ¼ 0.898) and 1.94 
(P ¼ 0.060). The 
fully adjusted HRs were 0.89 
(P ¼ 0.626) and 1.66 (P ¼ 0.155).

for those who filled prescriptions for antidepressant 
were 1.95 (P < 0.001) and 2.56 (P < 0.001), respec- 
tively, when compared with those who were not

In addition to these analyses, we examined the asso- 
ciation between the severity of depressive symptoms 
and the risk of CHD and CBVD by using the standard 
cut-offs as follows:23 scores of 0–9 indicated no 
depression, 10–18 indicated mild depression, 19–29 
indicated moderate depression and 30–63 indicated

toms. The corresponding fully adjusted HRs were

Discussion 
In this study we sought to compare the predictive 
power of depression for CHD with that for CBVD. 
Using a large population sample representative of 
the Finnish population in four age groups, we exam- 
ined the associations between depression and CHD 
and CBVD in the same population. Our results show 
that participants with mild to severe depressive symp- 
toms (BDI score 5 10) had an increased risk of CHD 
but not CBVD. The results also show that participants 
who filled antidepressant prescriptions had an 
increased risk of CHD but not CBVD. After adjust- 
ments for socio-demographics and bio-behavioural 
risk factors, only the associations between depression 
and incident CHD remained evident. A similar pattern 


of associations was observed when the measure of 
depression was modelled as a continuous variable. 




Comparison with previous studies 
To the best of our knowledge this is one of the first 
large aetiological studies to examine the associations 
of subclinical and clinical depression markers with 
CHD and CBVD as specific endpoints within the 
same population of men and women without a his- 
tory of diagnosed CHD or CBVD events at the study 
baseline. We found only one study, the Women’s 
Health Initiative study,24 that had examined the 
influence of depression symptoms for CHD and 
CBVD as specific endpoints in the same population. 
Using 
for 
Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), 
the study showed that 
in older post-menopausal 
women without a history of CHD or CBVD, depressive 
symptoms were not associated with an increased risk 
of incident stroke: unadjusted and adjusted HRs were 
1.09 and 1.01, respectively. Their finding is consistent 
with the present results based on a large population 
sample representative of the Finnish population in 
four equally sized age groups ranging from 20 to 54 
years. The CHD and CBVD events in our study were 
ascertained using data on hospitalizations from the 
Finnish National Hospital Discharge register and mor- 
tality data from the Statistics Finland register. Two 
validation studies22,25 have demonstrated that diagno- 
ses of fatal and non-fatal CHD events and causes of 
death in these registers were in strong agreement 
with major coronary events defined by strict criteria, 
justifying their use as endpoint measures in studies. 
Strengths of the present study also include the assess- 
ment of depression using both pharmacy refill records 
of antidepressant medications and a self-reported 
measure using a validated questionnaire. 
Our results, showing both markers of depression to 
be associated with an increased risk of incident CHD, 
are consistent with several prospective studies on 
healthy people that have demonstrated the predictive 
value of depression or depressive symptoms for the 
onset of CHD.4–7 We found the adjusted risk of CHD 
to be 1.7 for those with clinically significant depres- 
sion symptoms, broadly consistent with pooled rela- 
tive risks of CHD of between 1.64 and 1.80 in recent 
meta-analyses.5–7 It should be noted that we used 
prescription of antidepressant medication as a proxy 
measure to capture individuals who were more 
significant depression.

there is some evidence to suggest 
influence 



We also showed a 1-unit increase in the BDI score 
to be associated with an excess CHD risk of 3% (or 
63% for a 10-unit increase); this suggests that our 
findings were not sensitive to the specific cut-off 
used for defining depression using the BDI. These 
results are also consistent with the dose–response 
association found with CHD when focusing only on 
the severity of depressive symptoms 
(sensitivity 
analysis). 
As hypertension and/or diabetes are known to influ- 
ence both mental health and vascular disease 
risk,27–29 we conducted post hoc analyses stratifying 
the sample by hypertension and diabetes status. In 
participants without hypertension and diabetes, sex– 
age–education adjusted HRs for CHD were 1.43 
(P ¼ 0.046) for those with mild to severe depressive 
symptoms, i.e. scoring 510 on the 21-item BDI, and 
1.79 (P ¼ 0.052) for those who filled antidepressant 
these 
prescriptions compared with those without 
depression markers. The corresponding fully adjusted 
HRs were 1.31 (P ¼ 0.131) and 1.65 (P ¼ 0.096). In 
participants with hypertension and diabetes, sex– 
age–education adjusted HRs for CHD were 2.27 
(P ¼ 0.006) for those with mild to severe depressive 
symptoms, i.e. scoring 510 on the 21-item BDI, and 
2.43 (P ¼ 0.031) for those who filled antidepressant 
prescriptions compared with those without 
these 
depression markers. The corresponding fully adjusted 
HRs were 2.67 (P ¼ 0.001) and 2.80 (P ¼ 0.014). These 
stratified results provide some evidence that the effect 
of depression on CHD might be stronger in partici- 
pants with a history of diagnosed hypertension and 
diabetes. 
We found no consistent evidence of an association 
between depression symptoms, assessed by the BDI 
and categorized into a dichotomous variable using 
the standard cut-off, and CBVD, even in analysis 
adjusted simply for socio-demographic factors. This 
finding is consistent with some previous studies 
examining the association between depression and 
stroke.14,15,17 However, the majority of previous stu- 
dies (six out of nine studies) showing depression to 
be10–12 or not to be a risk factor14–16 for CBVD have 
been conducted in samples of elderly participants in 
contrast to our sample of working-aged adults. Two 
other studies have found depressive symptoms to be 
associated with an increased risk of stroke, but these 
findings were based on self-reported stroke8 or very 
few stroke events.9 Finally, the EPIC-Norfolk study17 
on 20 627 stroke-free participants (aged 41–80 years) 
with 595 incident stroke endpoints found major 
depressive disorder not to be associated with incident 
stroke. In contrast, psychological distress, a more gen- 
eral measure of mental health well-being, was asso- 
ciated with an increased incidence of stroke in that 
cohort. The authors invoked low prevalence of major 
depression in their sample as an explanation of the 
null 
finding for major depression. Furthermore, 
assessment of major depressive disorder symptoms 
was based on a 1-year or lifetime recall, a potential 
source of bias due to differential recall. The long 
period of recall may also explain the low prevalence 
of major depressive disorder in their sample insofar 


that people might have 
depression. 

The present finding showing a stronger predictive 
power of depression for CHD compared with that 
for CBVD is relatively novel due to the fact that 
both endpoints were examined in the same study. 
There is quite a lot of evidence to support the hypoth- 
esis of differential effects of various risk factors, 
including depression, on CHD and CBVD. There is 
already some evidence of differences in the relative 
impact of conventional risk factors for CHD and 
CBVD. An early study from the Framingham cohort 
found that high cholesterol levels were an important 
risk factor for myocardial infarction but not stroke.30 
In the same vein, more recent large prospective stu- 
dies have shown that elevated serum cholesterol is a 
strong risk factor for CHD, but the association with 
stroke varies depending on the stroke subtype. There 
is also evidence to suggest that systemic hypertension 
is a major risk factor for stroke, whereas its influence 
on ischaemic heart disease is less clear, particularly in 
the male population.31 Furthermore, several prospec- 
tive studies have reported either a U-shaped or no 
association between physical activity and stroke,32 
whereas current evidence clearly indicates its protec- 
tive influence on CHD risk.33 Finally, recent guide- 
lines for prevention of stroke suggest that the effect 
of alcohol and obesity on stroke is complex and con- 
troversial, which is in contrast to the known adverse 
effects on CHD.33 Thus, these differences in CHD and 
CBVD risk factors could be a possible explanation of 
why depression does not affect them equally. 
Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain 
how depression may be a risk factor for CHD. Both 
biological and behavioural mechanisms have been 
shown to mediate the link between depression and 
CHD. Depression has been found to be associated 
with pathophysiological changes that may increase 
the risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality, including 
autonomic nervous system dysfunction (e.g. elevated 
heart rate, low heart rate variability and exaggerated 
heart rate responses to physical stressors),35 hypotha- 
lamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysregulation (increased 
secretion),36 enhanced inflammatory pro- 
cortisol 
cesses (higher levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive pro- 
tein and fibrinogen)37 and accelerated progression of 
atherosclerosis as indicated by change in carotid 
intima-media thickness.38 Depression could also be 
linked to CHD via behaviour-related factors.39 In our 
study, depression markers were found to be asso- 
ciated with current smoking, high alcohol intake, obe- 
sity and sedentary life style, suggesting that these 
factors are potential mediators for the association 
between depression and CHD. Behavioural mediation 
was also supported by the finding that the association 
between depression and CHD was reduced when 
adjusting for behaviour-related factors. However, 
research is needed to examine whether 
further 
depression is related to sustained elevated CHD risk 
factors trajectories over time and whether it induces 
episodic elevations in risk factors, such as blood pres- 
sure, which could act as a trigger for coronary events 
among employees with subclinical CHD. Some of the 
CHD risk factors (e.g. high alcohol intake, sedentary 
life style and obesity) may also act as confounders by 
increasing the risk of both depression and CHD. 
Further studies examining the bidirectional associa- 
tion between bio-behavioural CHD risk factors and 
depression are needed in order to disentangle their 
temporal sequence. 
Limitations 
Interpretation of our findings should be considered 
within the context of the limitations of the study. 
First, the present study was based on a large popula- 
tion sample representative of the Finnish population 
in four age groups, but did not include elderly partic- 
ipants, which may limit the generalizability of our 
findings. In particular, this may explain why an asso- 
ciation between depression markers and CBVD was 
not evidenced in the present study. Secondly, CBVD 
endpoint-based on the main diagnosis was defined 
using ICD-10 codes I60–I69 (i.e. stroke and other 
CBVDs), and did not cover all manifestations of 
CBVD, which may limit the generalizability of our 
findings to others types of CBVD such as vascular 
dementia. Further studies are needed to examine 
the association between depression and CBVD sub- 
types, such as ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke. 
Thirdly, we assessed depression only at one point in 
time in the present study and did not track the 
chronicity or course of depression in relation to CHD 
and CBVD. Nevertheless, additional analyses revealed 
that the clinically diagnosed depression, based on 
filled prescriptions for antidepressant drugs, at the 
end of the study (in 2005) was 3.5 times higher for 
participants with mild to severe depression symptoms 
at study baseline. The corresponding odd was 8.6 
times higher for those with severe symptoms at this 
time, suggesting a persistence of depressive symptoms 
during the follow-up. Moreover, our sensitivity anal- 
yses revealed that depression was associated with 
CHD even after the removal of events occurring in 
the first 2 years of follow-up. 
Conclusions 
In this study on working-age adults from a randomly 
selected population of Finnish men and women ini- 
tially free from cardiovascular disease we found that 
mild to severely depressed participants had an 
increased risk for CHD over the 7 years of follow-up. 


There was no clear evidence that depression was 
associated with the risk of CBVD, but this result 
needs further confirmation.

(cid:2) The relationship between depression and CBVD continues to be debated although little research has 
compared the predictive power of depression for CHD with that for CBVD within the same 
population. 
(cid:2) After adjustment for basic socio-demographic factors and bio-behavioural risk factors, participants 
with mild to severe depressive symptoms, i.e. those scoring 5 10 on the 21-item BDI, and those who 
filled antidepressant prescriptions had an increased risk for CHD over the 7 years of follow-up 
compared with those without depression markers.
