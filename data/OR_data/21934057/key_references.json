Baseline psychological measures from that survey were then related to 15-year mortality and first incidence of cancer, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, functional gastrointestinal disease, and hyperimmune diseases.\n## RESULTS\nBaseline depression and the Langner Mental Health Index predicted incidence of functional gastrointestinal and hyperimmune diseases. The relationship of the Langner index to hyperimmune diseases was particularly strong; mortality, cancer, heart disease, hypertension, and stroke incidence were not related to that index. Except for affect balance, which was worst in the elderly, indications of psychological dysfunction were strongest in the young.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPsychological indices detected increased risk for functional gastrointestinal and hyperimmune diseases but were not related to mortality risk. Further research is needed to disaggregate relationships of the specific conditions that were included in the hyperimmune group. Functional gastrointestinal disease might be preventable with early attention to depressed persons and to those scoring high on the Langner index.\n",

The RR for stroke or myocardial infarction was 1.18(95%CI,1.08 to 1.30).

The predictors of ischemic stroke have not been well defined, although hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and previous stroke have been consistently reported. We report on 98 months' follow-up in a prospective study of cardiovascular disease in the Australian elderly, the Dubbo Study.\n## METHODS\nThe cohort, first examined in 1988, was composed of 2805 men and women 60 years and older. The prediction of ischemic stroke by potential risk factors was examined in a Cox proportional hazards model, after linkage to hospital and death records.\n## RESULTS\nThree hundred six men and women manifested an ischemic stroke event (ICD-9-CM 433 to 437), and 95 subjects suffered a fatal stroke event. In the multivariate model, the significant independent predictors of stroke were advancing age, female sex (48% lower risk), being married (30% lower risk), prior history of stroke (227% higher risk), use of antihypertensive drugs (37% higher risk), belonging to the highest category of blood pressure reading (67% higher risk), presence of atrial fibrillation (58% higher risk), HDL cholesterol (36% lower risk for each 1-mmol/L increment), impaired peak expiratory flow (77% higher risk for tertile I than for tertile III), physical disability (59% higher risk), and depression score (41% higher risk for tertile III than for tertile I).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese findings suggest that morbidity and mortality associated with ischemic stroke can be predicted by various clinical indicators, some of which may be amenable to intervention. The matters of impaired peak expiratory flow, depression score, and ischemic stroke require further study.\n",

Participants completed the Geriatric Depression Scale (short form) and were considered depressed if they reported 6 or more of 15 possible symptoms of depression. Women were followed up for an average of 6 years. If a participant died, we obtained a copy of the official death certificate and hospital records, if available, and used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes to classify death attributable to cardiovascular, cancer, or noncancer, noncardiovascular cause.\n## RESULTS\nMortality during 7-year follow-up varied from 7% in women with no depressive symptoms to 17% in those with 3 to 5 symptoms to 24% in those with 6 or more symptoms of depression (P<.001). Of 473 women (6.3%) with 6 or more depressive symptoms at baseline, 24% died (111 deaths in 2610 woman-years of follow-up) compared with 11% of women who reported 5 or fewer symptoms of depression (760 deaths in 41 460 woman-years of follow-up) (P<.001).

Therefore, we examined whether psychological distress leads to an increased risk of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA).\n## METHODS\nThe association between the 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), a measure of psychological distress, and the incidence of nonfatal and fatal ischemic stroke and TIA was measured by Cox regression modeling in a prospective observational study of 2201 men aged 45 to 59 years in phase II of the Caerphilly cohort. Hazard ratios comparing those with high (> or = 5) and normal GHQ scores were calculated with adjustment for age and other covariates.\n## RESULTS\nTwenty-two percent of men suffered from psychological distress, indicated by a score of > or =5 on the GHQ. There were 130 incident strokes recorded, of which 17 were fatal and 113 nonfatal. The relative risk of incident ischemic stroke was 1.45 (95% CI, 0.98 to 2.14) for those who showed symptoms of psychological distress compared with those who did not. For fatal stroke the relative risk was 3.36 (95% CI, 1.29 to 8.71) and for nonfatal stroke 1.25 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.92). The relative risk of TIA for the distressed group was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.26 to 1.53). The results were unchanged after adjustment for body mass index, systolic blood pressure, smoking, heavy drinking, social class, and marital status. However, additionally controlling for previously diagnosed ischemic heart disease, diabetes, respiratory disease, and retirement due to ill health attenuated the relative risks, but not markedly. For fatal strokes the relative risk decreased to 2.56 (95% CI, 0.97 to 6.75) when all confounding variables were included in the model. There was a graded association between degree of psychological distress and risk of fatal ischemic stroke.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPsychological distress is a predictor of fatal ischemic stroke but not of nonfatal ischemic stroke or TIA.

In the proportional hazards model, which included three GHQ subscales depicting these factors simultaneously, the depression subscale was associated with increased mortality from cerebrovascular disease (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio per unit increase in the standard score on the depression subscale=2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.17-3.55), and the apathy/anergia subscale was associated with increased mortality from noncancer and noncardiovascular causes (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio per unit increase in the standard score on the apathy/anergia subscale=1.71, 95% CI=1.25-2.34). The anxiety subscale was not associated with any cause of death.\n## CONCLUSION\nDepressive symptoms and symptoms indicating apathy/anergia have differential influences on subsequent causes of death in older persons living in the community.

When a term for inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP)) was introduced in the model, the HRs were not appreciably altered (unadjusted HR=1.31, 95% CI=1.08-1.58; adjusted HR=1.25, 95% CI=1.02-1.53), indicating that CRP at baseline was not a mediator in this relationship. In analyses stratified according to CRP levels, a J-shaped relationship between depressive symptoms and stroke was evident in the unadjusted analyses; in the fully adjusted model, only CRP in the highest tertile was associated with a higher risk for stroke in the presence of higher depressive symptoms scores.\n## CONCLUSION\nThe analyses from this prospective study provide evidence of a positive association between depressive symptoms and risk of incident stroke. Inflammation, as measured according to CRP at baseline, did not appear to mediate the relationship between depressive symptoms and stroke.\n",

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nTo compare long-term survival rates and causes of death in community-dwelling elderly with and without depression using the International Research Diagnostic Criteria administered by a psychiatrist.\n## METHOD\nFrom 1985 to 2000, we prospectively examined Japanese persons (N = 920) aged 65 years or older. Cases with depression (n = 158) and a control sample without depression (N = 762) were evaluated. The main outcome variables were survival rates and causes of mortality.\n## RESULTS\nBy 2000, 61% of the subjects with depression had died. By contrast, 48% had died in the control group at the completion of the 15-year follow-up. Using age-adjusted Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we found a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-1.89) for mortality in the depressed group compared with controls (p = .0009). Importantly, in female subjects with depression, the HR was 1.55 (95% CI 1.16-2.07; p = .002). In males with depression, by contrast, the HR (1.34) was not significant (95% CI 0.84-2.13; p = .19). Significantly more subjects died of cerebrovascular disorders, malignant tumors, respiratory disorders, or suicide after the onset of depression compared with controls (p < .05).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDepression appears to be associated with a significant increase in the risk of mortality among elderly Japanese subjects, particularly in females. The elderly with a diagnosis of depression may be at an elevated risk of mortality owing to cerebrovascular disorder, malignant tumors, respiratory disorders, or suicide. These prospective data provide a new quantitative insight on gender differences and the long-term public health significance of depression among the community-dwelling elderly.\n",

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale was used to measure depressive symptoms. Incident stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) events were assessed by uniform diagnostic criteria. The association between depressive symptoms and risk of stroke/TIA was analyzed with Cox proportional-hazards models, after adjusting for traditional stroke risk factors.\n## RESULTS\nIn participants <65 years, the risk of developing stroke/TIA was 4.21 times greater (P= <0.001) in those with symptoms of depression. After adjusting for components of the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (hazard ratio=3.43, 95% CI=1.60 to 7.36, P=0.002) and education (hazard ratio=4.89, 95% CI=2.19 to 10.95), similar results were obtained. In subjects aged 65 and older, depressive symptoms were not associated with an increased risk of stroke/TIA. Taking antidepressant medications did not alter the risk associated with depressive symptoms.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn this community-based study, depressive symptoms were an independent risk factor for incident stroke/TIA in individuals <65 years. These data suggest that identification of depressive symptoms at younger ages may have an impact on the primary prevention of stroke.\n",

Moreover, they did not distinguish between men and women and did not perform psychiatric workups in those with depressive symptoms. This study examines the association between depressive symptoms, depressive disorder and the risk of stroke in the general population.\n## METHODS\nThis prospective population based cohort study included 4424 participants from the third Rotterdam Study Survey (1997-1999) who, at that time, were > or =61 years of age and free from stroke. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD) and considered present if the CESD score was > or =16. Participants with depressive symptoms had a diagnostic interview for depressive disorder. Follow-up was complete until 1 January 2005. Data were analysed using Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for relevant confounders.\n## RESULTS\nMen with depressive symptoms (n = 73) were at increased risk of stroke (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.17; 95% CI 1.11 to 4.23) and ischaemic stroke (adjusted HR 3.21; 95% CI 1.62 to 6.38). These associations were at least partly attributable to men who reported depressive symptoms but who did not fulfil Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV diagnostic criteria for depressive disorder (n = 32): they had a very high risk of stroke (adjusted HR 2.70; 95% CI 1.15 to 6.33) and ischaemic stroke (adjusted HR 4.01; 95% CI 1.68 to 9.57). In women there was no association between presence of depressive symptoms and risk of stroke.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nPresence of depressive symptoms is a strong risk factor for stroke in men but not in women.\n",

Few studies have examined whether depression increases the risk for stroke in the very old and among the demented. We examined the relation between depression in 85-year-olds and the 3-year incidence of first-ever stroke.\n## METHODS\nA representative sample of 494 85-year-olds (147 demented, 347 nondemented) in Gothenburg, Sweden, was examined with psychiatric examinations and key informant interviews. Diagnoses of depression and dementia were made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Revision. The sample was followed for 3 years regarding the incidence of stroke. Information on stroke was obtained from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register, death certificates, self-reports, and key informants. Those with known stroke history at baseline (n=93) were excluded from the incidence study.\n## RESULTS\nThe prevalence of depression at age 85 was 19%. Depression at baseline (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 4.7; P=0.0006) and systolic blood pressure (hazard ratio, 1.014 per 1 mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.03; P=0.019) were related to increased incidence of first-ever stroke during follow-up. Depression increased stroke risk both among demented and nondemented individuals. Among the symptoms of depression, only depressed mood was an independent predictor of incidence first-ever stroke in multivariate analyses. Stroke history at age 85 was not associated with clinical depression.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDepression and stroke are both common in elderly populations. The finding that depression increases risk for first-ever stroke indicates that detection and treatment of depression may have implications for stroke prevention.\n",

Elevated depressive symptoms (3+ on an 8-item Centers for the Epidemiologic Study of Depression scale) and memory impairment (score of \u22646 on a combined immediate and delayed recall of a 10-word list) were used as predictors of incident stroke in Cox survival models with adjustment for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors.\n## RESULTS\nAfter adjustment for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors, elevated depressive symptoms (hazard ratio = 1.25; 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.39) and memory impairment (hazard ratio = 1.26; 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.41) each predicted stroke incidence in separate models. Hazard ratios were nearly unchanged and remained significant (1.23 for elevated depressive symptoms and 1.25 for memory impairment) when models were simultaneously adjusted for both elevated depressive symptoms and memory impairment. Elevated depressive symptoms also predicted stroke when restricting analyses to individuals with median memory score or better.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nMemory impairments and depressive symptoms independently predict stroke incidence. Memory impairment may reflect undiagnosed cerebrovascular disease. These results suggest that depressive symptoms might be directly related to stroke rather than merely indicating preexisting cerebrovascular disease.\n",
