Articles were considered for inclusion in the systematic review if: (1) the authors reported data from an original, peer-reviewed study (i.e., not review articles, or meeting abstracts); (2) the study was a cohort study (prospective cohort or historical cohort) consisting of non-institutionalized adults (>18 years old); and (3) the authors reported the risk estimates of stroke morbidity or mortality in depressed participants compared with non-depressed individuals. We used broad inclusion criteria for studies, including all types of stroke (total, fatal, nonfatal, ischemic, and hemorrhagic) and depression status (assessed by different scales or clinical diagnosis). We identified articles eligible for further review by performing an initial screen of identified titles or abstracts, followed by a full-text review.",
