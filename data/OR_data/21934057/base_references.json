            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      It has been suggested that executive dysfunction could be the core defect in patients with geriatric or vascular depression, and that this depression-dysexecutive syndrome (DES) might be related to frontal-subcortical circuit dysfunction. The authors tested this hypothesis in 158 poststroke patients, of whom 21 had both depression and executive dysfunction.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this cross-sectional cohort study, a neurological, psychiatric, and neuropsychological examination was carried out 3 months after ischemic stroke, and brain infarcts, white-matter changes, and brain atrophy were recorded by MRI.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The 21 patients with DES had significantly more brain infarcts affecting their frontal-subcortical circuit structures than the 137 patients without DES, or the 41 patients with depression but without executive dysfunction. Patients with DES also had more severe depressive symptoms and worse psychosocial functioning, and they coped less well in complex activities of daily living.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      DES is a valid concept and may define a subgroup of poststroke patients with frontal-subcortical pathology and with distinct prognosis and treatment options."

Prevalence of cerebrovascular risk factors was similar in patients with TGA and TIA, but significantly lower in the third group. CT showed more hypodense lesions in TIA patients than in those with TGA. In a mean follow-up of 36 months, five TGA patients experienced a TIA and three others had recurrence of TGA, but none suffered stroke or myocardial infarction. In the TIA group, four had recurrence of TIA, two suffered a stroke and two others a myocardial infarction, whereas none had TGA attacks. None of the patients of the third group had any ischaemic event during follow-up. The similar prevalence of risk factors, but the different prognosis between TGA and TIA patients, suggest that TGA is an ischaemic event, probably not triggered by thromboembolism but by a different, possibly vasospastic, mechanism."

No significant differences were present between the 3 groups as regards age and sex distribution as well as hemisyndrome severity. The neurological and psychiatric findings at follow-up differed significantly from the primary findings. Also, significant differences were found in the degree of disability, and in the self- and family ratings of rehabilitation outcome, with a poorer long-term course, i.e. a higher degree of disability, significantly more frequent in the dementia group. Comparison of self- and family-ratings showed that self-ratings given were significantly worse in the dementia and depressive groups, whereas patients with purely neurological symptoms rated themselves better than their relatives did."

The EEG and SPECT scans were examined independently of the clinical data. The former were divided into two abnormal categories, those showing AD type change and vascular change respectively, and a normal group. The SPECT scans were classified as follows: a SPECT rCBF pattern showing bilateral temporoparietal perfusion deficits (AD type); those showing single focal perfusion deficits or multiple areas of low perfusion in the cerebral cortex suggestive of ischaemic change (vascular type SPECT picture); a mixed AD/MID pattern; and those with normal scan findings. There were significant associations between clinical diagnosis, EEG rating and SPECT rCBF pattern, approximately three-quarters of AD and MID patients having the predicted EEG and scan changes. Normal EEG recordings were more common in the MID patients. The two tests agreed in about two-thirds of cases, with no consistent pattern apparent in the cases with divergent findings. Each test misclassified a minority of dementia patients, but in only one patient were both investigations normal. Almost half of the so called 'functionally ill' patients had abnormal rCBF changes, showing mainly vascular changes while one-fifth had abnormal EEGs."

It has significant impact on rehabilitation, motor recovery, activities of daily living, social and interpersonal life, and mortality. Several studies have shown that biological and psychosocial factors play significant roles in the development of this disabling disease. Recent research shows that neurochemical processes also may play some role in the pathophysiology of this condition. Several trials have shown evidence that the older, as well as newer antidepressants and psychostimulants may reduce/prevent depressive symptoms after stroke. At this point there are no clear guidelines available to choose safe and effective treatments. Drugs are selected based on their efficacy and side effect profile in these patients.

PATIENTS 44 depressed stroke patients. INTERVENTION Both groups were given an information booklet and the intervention group were then visited regularly by a research social worker over a period of 4 months. The social worker adopted a pragmatic approach which included providing counselling and information on services and benefits. MAIN RESULTS The study groups did not differ in level of social independence (p greater than 0.05) or total number of financial benefits (p greater than 0.05), services (p greater than 0.05) or aids (p greater than 0.05) received either before or after intervention.

Participants were randomized to active antihypertensive drug therapy or matching placebo. Active treatment consisted of 12.5 to 25 mg of chlorthalidone for step 1, while step 2 consisted of 25 to 50 mg of atenolol. If atenolol was contraindicated, 0.05 to 0.10 mg of reserpine could be used for the second-step drug. The impact of drug treatment on measures of cognitive, emotional, and physical function and leisure activities was assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Our analyses demonstrate that active treatment of isolated systolic hypertension in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program cohort had no measured negative effects and, for some measures, a slight positive effect on cognitive, physical, and leisure function. The positive findings in favor of the treatment group were small. There was no effect on measures related to emotional state. Measures of cognitive and emotional function were stable in both groups for the duration of the study. Both treatment groups showed a modest trend toward deterioration of some measures of physical and leisure function over the study period.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The overall study cohort exhibited decline over time in activities of daily living, particularly the more strenuous ones, and some decline in certain leisure activities. However, mood, cognitive function, basic self-care, and moderate leisure activity were remarkably stable for both the active and the placebo groups throughout the entire study. Results of this study support the inference that medical treatment of isolated systolic hypertension does not cause deterioration in measures of cognition, emotional state, physical function, or leisure activities."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to describe the life situation among 'significant others' to patients with post-stroke depression, and to identify associations between the life situation of the significant others and patient characteristics. Seventy-one dyads consisting of patients with a diagnosed post-stroke depression and their significant others were included. The patients were assessed for depression with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and diagnosed according to the DSM-IV. The assessments of significant others included their own life situation and proxy assessments of the patients' state of depression, anger, change of personality, and need of assistance. Significant others of male stroke patients reported a more negative impact on their life situation, than did significant others of female stroke patients (p = 0.04). There was a significant association between the patient's level of depression and physical function [activities of daily living (ADL)], with those with less impaired ADL having more major depression than those with more impaired ADL (p = 0.007). This study indicates that major post-stroke depression is more common among patients with limited functional deficits. This highlights the importance of assessment for depression also among seemingly recovered stroke patients in order to treat and support those in need. This study also stresses the importance of identifying different needs of the significant others in order to provide appropriate support in their caregiving role."

            "abstract": "Depression is a common and under-recognized cause of suffering after stroke. Poststroke depression (PSD) is associated with poorer stroke recovery and increased mortality. Much published research focuses on controversies about demographic and lesion-related associations with PSD and the extent to which it is different from primary depressive illness without stroke. Methodological and population differences across studies account for at least part of the inconsistent research findings about PSD. Rates of treatment for PSD appear to be extremely low. Surprisingly little evidence is available about the effectiveness of various treatments for PSD, and randomized controlled clinical trials are needed. This article summarizes epidemiologic data about PSD, highlights stroke-related and demographic features that increase risk, and reviews the literature on treatment."

There were no significant differences between PSD and ND groups in terms of sex, age, past psychiatric history, family psychiatric history, stroke diagnosis, or neurological symptoms. The scores of PSD patients on Zung's self-rating depression scale and the Hamilton depression rating scale were significantly higher than those of ND patients. Furthermore, the Activities of Daily Living measured by the Functional Independence Measure and cognitive function evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination of ND patients were significantly better than those of PSD subjects.

            "abstract": "Depression in late life is a recognised public health problem. After establishing socio-demographic and psychological risk factors for depression, epidemiological research has focused on biological factors. This review summarises the evidence on the associations of cerebrovascular pathology, inflammation, and endocrine and nutritional status with depression in the elderly. The most consistent finding in biological psychiatry is the disturbance of the hypothalamic-pituary-adrenal axis in depressed persons. About half of the patients with severe depression have a disturbed glucocorticoid feedback mechanism and many exhibit hypercortisolism. Longitudinal studies show that this endocrine dysfunction increases the risk of relapse. More recently, silent brain infarcts and cerebral white matter lesions on MRI were found to be more frequent in the depressed elderly than in controls. Cerebral small vessel disease has been rediscovered as a potential cause of depression. Furthermore, there is evidence of immune activation in depressed persons. However, it remains unclear as to whether inflammation contributes to the pathological process as longitudinal studies are lacking. Clinical studies have also related many nutrients to psychological symptoms, but the evidence in elderly persons is consistent only for some vitamin deficiencies. In conclusion, despite a substantial body of literature on biological correlates of late life depression, little is known about causal relations. Prospective population-based studies are warranted."

The majority of patients were recruited from a rehabilitation hospital in Des Moines, Iowa, but other enrollment sites were also used. Both depressed and nondepressed patients were enrolled to determine whether improved recovery could be mediated by mechanisms unrelated to depression.

Response to treatment of depression for individual patients was defined as a greater-than-50% reduction in scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and no longer fulfilling diagnostic criteria for major or minor depression.

Our preliminary data found that 5 mg.kg-1.d-1 of venlafaxine treatment prevented decreased synaptophysin (SYP) in the hippocampus, which results from chronic restrained stress in the rat model. The present study investigates whether venlafaxine regulates alterations of synaptophysin and neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in a post-stroke depression mouse model. We compared the expression level of SYP and NCAM in the hippocampus of global cerebral ischemic (GCI) mice treated with different doses of venlafaxine using immunohistological and Western blot analysis. Pre-treatment with intraperitoneal injection of venlafaxine (2.5 and 5.0 mg.kg-1.d-1) for 14 days significantly prevented the decrease of SYP in the hilus area of the hippocampus in vehicle-treated GCI mice. NCAM was significantly higher in the hippocampus of vehicle-treated GCI mice, and pretreatment with venlafaxine prevented alterations of NCAM, with the high-dose venlafaxine group comparable with vehicle-sham mice. The results suggest the alteration of neuronal remodeling proteins in the hippocampus may be an underlying mechanism of venlafaxine in treating post-stroke depression."

Our recent study of elderly suicide victims from an Australian forensic medicine department (n = 143), unlike a previous case-control study, did not find an increased prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older persons who committed suicide despite a history of dementia in 6.3%. Both studies were limited to the examination of AD-related pathology by the availability of tissue. We present clinicopathological data on three cases from our study for whom autopsy findings were available. These cases included: a community-dwelling male in his early eighties with dementia who was found to have multiple cortical and striatal lacunes and glial scars, small vessel cerebrovascular disease (SVD) and AD-related pathology; a community-dwelling male in his mid-seventies with depression and loss of concentration, with brainstem predominant Lewy body disease (LBD) and AD-related pathology; and a female nursing home resident in her nineties with a history of stroke and prior suicide attempts who was found to have infarcts and SVD in frontal regions. Neuropathological findings in elderly suicide victims may include multiple neurodegenerative pathologies. The burden and distribution of neurodegenerative diseases apart from AD, including SVD and LBD, should be assessed as possible pathophysiological factors contributing to late life suicide."

The effectiveness of antidepressant drugs in the management of post-stroke depression (PSD) has been widely investigated. However, the choice of antidepressant drug is critically influenced by its safety and tolerability and by its effect on concurrent pathologies. Here we investigate the efficacy and safety of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), citalopram, and a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (NARI), reboxetine, in post-stroke patients affected by anxious depression or retarded depression.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a randomized double-blind study. Seventy-four post-stroke depressed patients were diagnosed as affected by anxious or retarded depression by using a synoptic table.

The aim of this study is to examine the rates of cerebrovascular, AD, and DLB pathology among the first 10 participants in an LLMD brain tissue donation program. Subjects' psychiatric diagnoses and cognitive status were prospectively determined during their participation in clinical research protocols of the Intervention Research Center for Late Life Mood Disorders. After death, final clinical diagnoses were made using all clinical information, while blind to neuropathologic diagnoses. Neuropathologic assessments were conducted blind to final clinical diagnoses. Rates of neuropathology were compared with those in a cohort of subjects with dementia, without a history of LLMD, participating in an Alzheimer Disease Research Center. Seven (70%) subjects had evidence of onset of a dementia prior to death. LLMD with dementia was significantly associated with a neuropathologic diagnosis of AD. Cerebrovascular disease and DLB pathology were also frequent in the LLMD subjects with dementia, and were found in an LLMD subject without dementia. Rates of AD, DLB, and cerebrovascular disease were similar to those in the comparison subjects. These preliminary findings suggest that AD is the predominant neuropathologic condition in LLMD subjects with dementia. Further assessment of the role of comorbid cerebrovascular disease and comorbid DLB is needed."

This leads to psychological problems which are likely to influence the patient's life satisfaction, long-term rehabilitation outcome, and quality of life as much as the physical consequences caused by the stroke, The patient's ability to accept the new reality created by a disability as a part of their future life is therefore essential. This necessitates an individual coping strategy in the center of which is a mourning process, which unfolds in the same way as other experiences of vital threat, e.g. confrontation with one's own dying. Different stages of mourning that can also be found in stroke patients are nonacceptance of the facts, erupting emotions, parting with the former and finding of a new self as well as new perspectives for one's future. Whether a coping process is successful does not depend on the type of the defense mechanisms or stages, but essentially on their persistence. It is the task of the therapeutical team to support this process by applying a basic therapeutic behavior, stage-consistent interventions and a positive feedback. A failed process of coping may be one of the causes of the high prevalence of psychological disorders like depression and anxiety disorders in patients having suffered a stroke."

These \"vascular depressions\" may result from damage of striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical pathways which frequently occurs in cerebrovascular disease.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      We have searched the English and French literature published between 1996 (when the \"vascular depression\" hypothesis was first stated) and December 2004 through the Medline computer database and examined the validity of the concept of \"vascular depression\" thanks to four levels of validity: face validity, descriptive validity, construct validity and predictive validity. The face validity is the extent to which experts agree about the existence of a nosological entity.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The reviews published in this field broadly support the concept of \"vascular depression\" as a specific disorder. However many authors highlighted the fact that depression has been shown to precede vascular diseases and that depression and vascular diseases may both share some pathogenic or genetic determinants. These interactive and co-morbid relationships between depression and cerebrovascular diseases are difficult to disentangle. The descriptive validity refers to the degree of the clinical specificity of a disorder. It appears only moderate regarding the clinical studies carried out on this issue. However, a late-onset, the absence of a family history of mental illness, the lack of insight, lassitude, psychomotor retardation, a greater disability and particular neuropsychological dysfunctions may be associated with vascular depression. The construct validity, which refers to the degree to which the physiopathological processes involved in an illness are understood, appears difficult to establish because of the complex interactive relationships between cerebrovascular disease and depression. However, cerebrovascular diseases may contribute to the occurrence of depressive symptoms independently of its psychosocial burden. The predictive validity refers to the degree to which a syndrome is characterized by a specific response to treatment or a specific natural history. As regards response to treatment, vascular depression appears rather specific in the sense of a worse response to antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy. The studies on the natural history of vascular depression lead to inconsistent results. According to some authors, this relative resistance to treatment may be explained by structural rather than functional, and thus potentially irreversible disruption in neural networks.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In conclusion, the systematic review of the validity of vascular depression broadly supports this concept. However, further studies are needed to decipher the relationships between depression and cerebrovascular disease. Finally, we suggest that it could be more relevant for future researches in this field if the diagnostic criteria for vascular depression were narrowed and required the presence of both neuro-imaging changes and cerebrovascular disease."

In stroke, depression mainly occurred within 3 months after the event but in PD, depression developed randomly throughout the follow up period.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The one year cumulative incidence of post-stroke depression in the Thai population is much lower than in the Caucasian population. However, its adjusted cumulative incidence was much higher to that of PD. The findings are in line with previous studies that stroke significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of depression."

The development of both acute and delayed-onset suicidal plans was strongly related to the existence of depressive disorders, especially major depression, and to a prior history of stroke. Acute-onset suicidal plans were also related to premorbid alcohol abuse. Acute-onset suicidal patients had more anterior lesion location and delayed-onset suicidal patients had more posterior stroke lesions. Delayed-onset suicidal plans were not related to alcohol abuse but tended to be associated with greater physical impairment and poorer social support during the acute poststroke period. These data suggest that the etiology of these two types of suicidal plans may be different with acute onset related to biological mechanisms and delayed onset related to psychological mechanisms."

The overall rate of papers about depressive disorders in ageing people reflects adequately the world population and the prevalence of depression in the elderly. However, the rate of papers concerning medical experimentation for antidepressant treatment in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke is quite inadequate with respect to the rate of depressive disorders associated to these conditions.

Subjective feelings of impaired energy or drive after right insular damage may result from disconnection between the insula and the frontal lobe or the anterior cingulate cortex, structures that have been associated with willed action and motor behavior."

Although tricyclic antidepressants have well-established efficacy in the treatment of functional depression, they are not often used to treat depression following stroke. Studies have identified two types of depression in patients following stroke: major depression and minor depression. Longitudinal studies indicate that untreated major depression may last about 1 year, whereas untreated minor depression may last more than 2 years. Patients with depression who are not treated with antidepressant medication have been found to do more poorly on several measures of physical and cognitive rehabilitation than depressed patients who are treated. Two double-blind drug treatment studies of depression following stroke have been done. Although adverse side effects were reported in both studies, serious side effects were no more common in the active drug group than in the placebo group. Both studies, however, reported significantly better outcome, measured by depression scores or activities of daily living, in patients treated with nortriptyline or trazodone than in placebo-treated controls. Thus, although the use of antidepressant medication requires caution, the recognition and treatment of depression in patients who have had a stroke may result in a significant enhancement of both physical and cognitive recovery as well as emotional state."

In the literature the term of a \"Poststroke Depression\" (PSD) has already been established. However standardised criteria for this diagnoses do not exist to this day. In most cases the DSM or ICD classification system is applied. Other investigators used various psychiatric rating scales. Even though it is generally acknowledged that there is a high prevalence, the occurrence of depression in combination with a stroke fails in most cases to be diagnosed or is left untreated. The need for treatment is even more pronounced by studies showing that a combination of stroke and depression will result in a less favourable outcome, particularly pertaining to that of functional treatment (motor skills, independent participation in activities of daily life). This difference in impairment between a depressed stroke patient and a not depressed stroke patient could be proven in studies that have been conducted over years. Despite the necessity of treatment that can be concluded from such a finding, the recent literature does not offer consistent information as to the ideal point of time for intervention nor the kind and intensity necessitated. According to singular studies, that have rarely been conducted under controlled conditions, there have been positive outcomes after early treatment. Along with psychostimulants that were most predominantly applied in the USA, as well as conventional tricyclic antidepressants, the group of the \"Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, SSRIs\" have resulted in particularly favourable clinical outcomes."

The functional status was assessed by the Barthel index and the functional independence measures on admission and after a 3-month rehabilitation period. On the basis of the apathy scale, the patients were grouped into those experiencing apathy and those who did not. Next, the scores of the functional measures in the two groups were compared. A total of 67 patients--38 males and 29 females--were analyzed. Fourteen patients (21%) were diagnosed as being apathetic. The apathetic patients tended to be older and more cognitively impaired than the nonapathetic patients. The severity of neurological deficits, the frequency of depression, and the functional status on admission did not differ substantially in the patients with or without apathy. Although the difference was marginal, apathetic patients showed less improvement in the Barthel index or the subscore of functional independence measures than nonapathetic patients after rehabilitation.

This study was undertaken to examine the association of depressed mood with other depressive symptoms to determine which symptoms were most useful in the accurate diagnosis of major depression after stroke.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using a structured mental status examination, 142 patients with acute stroke were followed at three, six, twelve, and twenty-four months.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The median number of vegetative and psychological symptoms among patients with depressed mood was more than three times the respective rates among nondepressed patients at all time points over two years. Autonomic anxiety, morning depression, subjective anergia, worrying, brooding, loss of interest, hopelessness, and lack of self-confidence were significantly more frequent among depressed patients than nondepressed patients throughout the entire two-year period. Some symptoms such as anxious foreboding and loss of libido, as well as self-depreciation, feelings of guilt, and irritability were no longer significantly more common among depressed compared with nondepressed patients after six months. Standard DSM-IV diagnostic criteria and modified DSM-IV diagnostic criteria which included only specific symptoms of depression (i.e., symptoms which were significantly more frequent among depressed than nondepressed mood patients) yielded similar frequencies of major depression diagnosis. There were only a few patients (i.e., 2% to 3%) with depressive symptoms without a depressed mood (perhaps \"masked\" depression).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Vegetative and psychological depressive symptoms are significantly more common in depressed patients over the first two years after stroke and DSM-IV criteria do not overdiagnose major depression even in this population with chronic physical illness. The symptoms which characterize major depression appear to change between the subacute and chronic post-stroke periods."

The concept of entirety and permanency implies that rehabilitation must commence on the very first day of acute therapy and continue, with the aid of relatives, after discharge from hospital. Depression very frequently accompanies a stroke and requires expert handling both with psychopharmaceutical drugs and psychotherapeutical methods (including nursing staff and family) to overcome this hurdle to rehabilitation. Physiotherapy is of paramount importance, with particular emphasis on active movement. Therapeutic management with medicines must continue along the lines commenced in the acute stage. The therapy of stroke requires a considerable involvement of manpower, which must not be denied to this step-child of rehabilitation. Apart from medical considerations, it is salutary to remember that every fifteenth person is likely to be handicapped after a stroke at some time in his life."

Brain CT and MRI demonstrated infarctions in the left lateral thalamus, internal capsule, lateral geniculate body, hippocampus, caudate nucleus and medial occipitotemporal gyrus. IMP-SPECT showed extensive hypoperfusion areas in the left cerebral hemisphere. These lesions were thought to have resulted from occlusion of the left anterior choroidal artery and partial occlusion of the left middle and posterior cerebral arteries caused by cardiogenic embolism. AG persisted and SP disappeared 80 days after the onset.

Nurses can make a substantial improvement to patient care by not only being aware of this issue, but also by making an active contribution to the detection of depression in stroke survivors and their carers. The mental health of carers is intertwined with the mental health and disease presentation of the patient. A family centred approach with a dual focus on the stroke survivor and the carer is therefore needed to maximize success in post-stroke care. Nurses can teach families to recognize depression and assist them to accept treatment. They can use the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item depression scale (PHQ-9) as probably the most suitable screening and diagnostic tool for both groups. Nurses can play a role in destigmatizing the diagnosis and the link between symptoms of depression and treatment.

Most negative studies of the clinical significance of subcortical hyperintensities on MRI in geriatric patients have sampled from a restricted range of subjects, have employed limited batteries of neuropsychological tests, or have not quantified MRI changes; the present study attempted to address these limitations. Thirty subjects from a geriatric psychiatry inpatient service who were over 60 years of age and presented with major depression were divided into groups with onset of first depression after age 60 (mean = 72.4 years, 15 women, 0 men), and onset of first depression before age 60 (mean = 35.8 years, 12 women, 3 men). Quantitative analysis of MRI yielded the volume of: periventricular hyperintensities (PVH) and deep white-matter hyperintensities (DWMH). Subjects were administered a neuropsychological battery and measures of depression by raters blind to age of onset. The late-onset group had significantly more PVH and DWMH. They were also more impaired on executive and verbal and nonverbal memory tasks. Discriminant analysis using the severity or subcortical signal hyperintensities on MRI, cognitive index, and depression scores correctly predicted late versus early onset of depression in 87% of the early-onset group and 80% of the late-onset group.

This case also illustrates how the atypical presentation of disease in the elderly, as well as the medical ramifications of rehabilitative therapies, need to be strongly considered during trials at functional rehabilitation. More importantly, however, this case demonstrates how even a community-based geriatrician can be instrumental in recognizing the need of more appropriate evaluations in elderly patients with functional disabilities and how even in the setting of a multidisciplinary team there can still be a consulting relationship, with each person seeing the patient individually and communicating with other members of the team as necessary. Although each team member may have a specific area of expertise, there is still a very important role for the geriatrician to play in making sure that all the different components of the rehabilitation and the medical care proceed in a way that will provide the most favorable outcome for the patient."

            "abstract": "This article reviews the syndromic concepts of depression and dementia and the concurrence of these common entities. In DAT, depression appears to be a reversible source of excess disability, amenable to pharmacologic as well as environmental interventions. In the vascular dementias, depression appears to be a specific complicating feature, in which localization of the lesion plays a significant role. The abulic state should not be mistaken for a depressive syndrome, although its presence should alert the clinician to evaluate for dementia and depression. Depression is especially prevalent in the subcortical dementias. Future studies using dynamic neuroimaging will help define the limits of this important concept. Reversible forms of dementia are much less common than previously suspected. The clinician's task is to identify causes of excess disability due to superimposed illnesses while avoiding diagnostic or therapeutic nihilism. The appropriate use of medication and the ongoing surveillance for adverse drug reactions are the foremost tasks of today's clinician treating the elderly patient."

With respect to the importance of establishing altered Ca2+ homeostasis in peripheral cells, we have investigated [Ca2+]i in circulating mononuclear cells of patients with AD, multi-infarct dementia, age-associated memory impairment and healthy controls.

There was only a tendency towards a decrease in [Ca2+]i in AD after stimulation with PHA.

The results suggest that poststroke depression itself may produce an intellectual impairment; subcortical atrophy, which likely preceded the stroke lesion, may produce a vulnerability for depression following stroke."

The prevalence of PSD varies over time with an apparent peak 3-6 months after stroke and subsequent decline reaching about 50% of the initial rates at one year. The natural course of major depression after stroke has spontaneous remission typically 1 to 2 years after stroke. However, it has also been observed that depression becomes chronic and may persist for more than 3 years following stroke. On the other hand, minor depression appears to be more variable, with both short-term and long-term depression occurring in these patients.

We used proportional hazards models to evaluate the extent to which the association of depressive symptoms with subsequent cardiovascular events (heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or death) was explained by baseline disease severity and potential biological or behavioral mediators.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 341 cardiovascular events occurred during 4876 person-years of follow-up. The age-adjusted annual rate of cardiovascular events was 10.0% among the 199 participants with depressive symptoms (PHQ score > or = 10) and 6.7% among the 818 participants without depressive symptoms (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval, [CI], 1.16-1.95; P = .002). After adjustment for comorbid conditions and disease severity, depressive symptoms were associated with a 31% higher rate of cardiovascular events (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.00-1.71; P = .04). Additional adjustment for potential biological mediators attenuated this association (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.94-1.63; P = .12). After further adjustment for potential behavioral mediators, including physical inactivity, there was no significant association (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.79-1.40; P = .75).\n## CONCLUSION\nIn this sample of outpatients with coronary heart disease, the association between depressive symptoms and adverse cardiovascular events was largely explained by behavioral factors, particularly physical inactivity.\n"

Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline with the use of the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). The incidence of stroke was ascertained under systematic surveillance.\n## RESULTS\nDuring the 10-year follow-up, 69 strokes (39 ischemic strokes, 10 intracerebral hemorrhages, 10 subarachnoid hemorrhages, and 10 unclassified strokes) occurred. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of mild depression (SDS scores >/=40) at baseline was 25% among subjects with incident stroke and 12% among subjects without stroke (P<0.01). Persons with SDS scores in the high tertile had twice the age- and sex-adjusted relative risk of total stroke as those with scores in the low tertile. The excess risk was confined to ischemic stroke. After we adjusted for body mass index, systolic blood pressure level, serum total cholesterol level, cigarette smoking, current treatment with antihypertensive medication, and history of diabetes mellitus, these relative risks remained statistically significant for total stroke (1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.5) and ischemic stroke (2.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 6.0).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDepressive symptoms predict the risk of stroke, specifically ischemic stroke among Japanese.\n"

There were significant correlations between scales suggesting the rating scales measure a common factor in the controls, while in the stroke groups associations were weaker and less likely to be significant.

Hospital or clinic-based studies were excluded because the inferences might not be easily applicable to the general population. 19 eligible studies of CRP were selected: seven for stroke, six for cognitive disorders, and six for depression. Raised CRP concentrations were associated with history of stroke and increased risk of incident stroke. Meta-analysis of studies with long follow-up (>8 years) showed that the risk for stroke in healthy individuals with the highest quartile of CRP concentrations increased nearly 70% compared to those with the lowest quartile. High concentrations of CRP were predictive of cognitive decline and dementia. The relations of CRP to depression were all cross-sectional and were not consistent.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group (n = 24) underwent MCAO and then re-divided into 3 equal subgroups: stroke subgroup, PSD model subgroup (undergoing isolated raising and CMS so as to establish PSD models), and citalopram subgroup (treated with intraperitoneal injection of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor for 6 weeks). The rats were examined dynamically at the 19th, 28th, and 42nd days after CMS by open-field test (OFT) and sucrose consumption test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      On the 19th day after CMS the locomotor activity score of the PSD models was significantly lower (P < 0.001 compared to the baseline level of the same subgroup and to those of the control and stroke rats, P < 0.01 compared to the CMS group); and the frequency of rearing score of the PSD models was significantly decreased (P < 0.001 compared to its baseline level and to those of the control and stroke groups, and P < 0.05 compared to the CMS group). During the days 19 - 42, the frequency of locomotor and exploratory activities of the PSD model rats declined continually, from 37.8 +/- 1.7 to 34.2 +/- 1.2 and from 9.7 +/- 0.8 to 7.8 +/- 0.8 respectively, showing a tendency in just the reverse direction in the CMS group (from 41.0 +/- 1.3 to 42.3 +/- 0.8 and from 11.2 +/- 0.4 to 11.7 +/- 0.8 respectively). The PSD rats showed a reduction in sucrose preference at week 3 and afterwards (P < 0.001 compared with other groups). The levels of open-field activities and proportion of rats with sucrose preference in the citalopram subgroup were all significantly higher than those in other groups (all P < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Anhedonia and underactivity, the core symptoms in the PSD patients, can be found completely and persistently in the PSD rats. With good operability and repeatability, the PSD rat model is an ideal model for PSD research. Citalopram can improve the behavior abnormality in PSD."

Patients living with unruptured and untreated aneurysms often report symptoms of anxiety and depression. There are few trials studying the quality of life after treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. We aimed to compare the quality of life and symptoms of anxiety or depression after endovascular coiling or open surgery clipping of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, in patients with no prior subarachnoid haemorrhage.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      73 living patients were included. 44 had undergone open surgery clipping and 31 had undergone endovascular coiling within the last 5.5 years. We registered a number of parameters from medical records and the patients' current quality of life was assessed by a questionnaire. 63 of 73 (86.3%) returned our questionnaire, which included the Norwegian version of SF-36 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD).\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Many patients treated for unruptured intracranial aneurysms have a relatively low quality of life. The low scores indicate that the patients experience limitations in their ability to work or accomplish desired activities due to perceived physical or mental handicaps. There were no significant differences between the open surgery group and the endovascular group when comparing quality of life parameters after treatment. A subgroup analysis of patients with a favourable functional outcome also showed reduced quality of life without any differences in the two treatment groups. There were no signs of improvement in quality of life over time.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Quality of life after treatment does not seem to be a strong argument for choosing one modality of treatment over the other in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms. There are no significant differences in the quality of life of patients successfully treated using endovascular technique and patients who underwent craniotomy and clipping. We speculate that the low quality of life scores are due to factors unrelated to the aneurysms. The scores possibly reflect characteristics of a patient group where incidental aneurysms are more frequently diagnosed while undergoing extensive imaging procedures due to unrelated symptoms."

Cerebrovascular disease has been postulated as an important aetiological factor in many cases (the \"vascular depression\" hypothesis). Consistent with this, an inflammatory response, most probably representing ischaemia, has been reported with increases in intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in postmortem tissue from elderly depressed subjects. As ischaemia is known to cause astrogliosis, this study has further tested the \"vascular depression hypothesis\" by investigating the distribution of the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the DLPFC and in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Postmortem tissue was obtained from 20 elderly patients with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) and 20 control subjects. Sections were stained for GFAP using standard immunocytochemistry. Sets of images were obtained from all cortical layers in the DLPFC and ACC with the exception of layer IV in the ACC, and from gyral and deep white matter in both regions. The percentage of the area of each image occupied by GFAP was calculated using true colour image analysis, and mean values obtained for each region examined.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Immunoreactivity for GFAP was low in grey matter (for example, Mean (SEM) 0.76 (0.2)% in DLPFC layer V in depressed subjects), but higher in white matter (for example, 12.02 (2.2)% in DLPFC deep white matter in depressed subjects). Pronounced gliosis was observed within grey matter in a few cases only. GFAP immunoreactivity was significantly higher in layer I of the DLPFC in depressed subjects 15.8 (2.6)% than in controls 9.7 (1.3)% (t=2.2; df=27.5, p=0.04). No difference was detected in any other region.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The data suggest any increase in GFAP in elderly MDD patients is limited to layer 1 of the DLPFC.

Twenty three patients with long-term aphasia due to stroke were tested. The patients were interviewed twice in a period from 2 to 12 days. The acceptability of the Spanish SAQOL-39 was evaluated by examining the floor/ceiling effects and the missing data. The reliability was assessed by Cronbach's alpha (internal consistence) and intraclass correlation coefficients (test-retest reliability) for the overall scale and its subdomains.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were no difficulties to translate the original version into Spanish.

Factors that predispose a patient to PVD (smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus) are also risk factors for the development of cerebrovascular disease, which could adversely affect rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that cognitive deficits are present in amputee patients with PVD. Fourteen patients with lower-extremity amputations secondary to PVD (4 women, 10 men; mean age = 67.4 years) were recruited from a tertiary-care center for physical rehabilitation. Fourteen community-dwelling healthy volunteers (9 women, 5 men; mean age = 69.9 years) served as age-matched and education-matched controls. To assess a broad range of cognitive function, we administered standard neuropsychological tests of memory and learning, language, praxis, visuospatial skills, and abstract reasoning. PVD patients performed significantly more poorly on certain measures of psychomotor speed (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Digit Symbol subtest) and problem solving/abstract reasoning (Modified Card Sorting Test) relative to controls (using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, p < .002). There were trends toward poorer patient performance on certain measures of oral fluency, concentration, reasoning, and visuoperceptual organization and constructional skills (p < .01). We propose that these cognitive deficits may be the result of unrecognized concomitant cerebrovascular disease in PVD patients and are part of a generalized pattern of vascular disease. Future research should control affective factors such as stress or depression surrounding amputation and attempt to identify the etiologic or demographic factors that are associated with neuropsychological deficits in patients with PVD."

The association between stroke and baseline self-reported depressive symptomatology was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for baseline age, race, sex, education, smoking status, body mass index, alcohol use, nonrecreational physical activity, serum cholesterol level, history of diabetes, history of heart disease, and systolic blood pressure. Hospital records and death certificates were used to identify stroke cases; a total of 483 cases were identified.\n## RESULTS\nIn age-adjusted models for all persons, white men, white women, and black persons of both sexes, depression was predictive of stroke. In risk-adjusted models for all persons (relative risk (RR) = 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.30-2.31) and for white men (RR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.02-2.75), depression remained predictive of stroke. For white women, depression (RR = 1.52, 95% CI = 0.97-2.38) reached borderline significance (p = .07). For black persons, depression (RR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.40-4.80) demonstrated a higher risk of stroke. A series of supplemental analyses also supported the association between depression and stroke.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDepression is predictive of stroke across all strata.

Associations with depression at follow-up included impaired cognition, lack of family support, institutionalization, inability to work, functional dependence, and low activity level.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Frequency of depression up to 5 years after stroke is 30%; however, it is a dynamic situation with recovery and new cases diagnosed over time.

            "abstract": "The consultation-liaison psychiatrist is confronted time after time with depression in the context of physical illness, and the link between the two is of practical and theoretical interest. In addressing this topic, current classification systems are ambiguous. The advent of research diagnostic criteria and the primary/secondary depression dichotomy have not clarified the problem as was hoped. The conventional view that physical illness only precipitates depression in the genetically predisposed has been challenged by recent studies in patients with stroke. These studies point to a specific role for factors such as lesion location, severity of disability, and social support. In addition, the process of adjustment to serious physical illness can be understood in terms of personal vulnerability including low self-esteem, conflict within close relationships (particularly marital), and negative experiences in the developmental history. Acting on this vulnerability is the stressful life event (e.g., illness) that can have particular force if \"matched\" to the subjects existing psychologic conflicts. A modifying factor on the outcome of the adjustment is the influence of social support in protecting the individual from the life event. A list of potential factors influencing the occurrence of depression with physical illness is proposed. Variables likely to have an important place include 1) family history of psychiatric disorder, 2) a past personal history of depression, 3) the premorbid personality, 4) the impact of life events including the illness, 5) the degree of disability from the illness, 6) the presence of brain pathology and neuroendocrine abnormalities, and 7) the quality of social support during the time of illness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The study included 268 participants from the Memory and Morbidity in Augsburg Elderly (MEMO) project, a population-based study on individuals aged 65 to 83 years, conducted in Augsburg, Germany. Cerebral MRI was performed, and 2 geriatric performance tests, scales to assess ADL, depressive symptoms, and self-perceived health status were assessed. The prevalence of large (>10 mm) subcortical WML was 37.7% and of MRI-defined infarct-like lesions was 15.3%. Both vascular lesion types combined were found in 9% of the participants. Large WMLs were associated with significantly more impairments in basic ADL, inferior results in the performance tests, and a worse self-perceived health status compared to those without large WML. Magnetic resonance imaging-defined brain infarct was associated with impairments in performance tests. Participants with both lesion types were limited in all domains and were 2 to 3 times more likely to have impairments in all examined functions. Their risk of impairment in a specific function was considerably higher than the sum of the single risks associated with each lesion type alone. This study suggests that the single and especially the combined occurrence of common vascular brain lesions are associated with functional impairment. Identifying individuals with severe WML combined with MRI-defined brain infarct can help better understand the development of marked impairments in old age."

Most all of the depressive disorders of the elderly are amenable to one form or combination of therapies: pharmacologic, electro-convulsive, or psychotherapy.

Cox proportional hazards regression analyses with the CES-D scale as a time-dependent variable, controlling for multiple covariates, indicated a 25% increased risk of death per 5-unit increase in the CES-D score (relative risk [RR], 1.25;95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 1.36). The RR for stroke or myocardial infarction was 1.18(95%CI,1.08 to 1.30). Increase in CES-D score was an independent predictor in both placebo and active drug groups, and it was strongest as a risk factor for stroke among women (RR,1.29;95%CI,1.07 to 1.34).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAmong elderly persons, a significant and substantial excess risk of death and stroke or myocardial infarction was associated with an increase in depressive symptoms over time, which may be a marker for subsequent major disease events and warrants the attention of physicians to such mood changes. However, further studies of casual pathways are needed before wide-spread screening for depression in clinical practice is to be recommended.\n"

Forty-five HIV negative (HIV-) cocaine abusers, 36 HIV positive (HIV+) cocaine abusers (CD4; mean 378, +/-229) and 27 control HIV- subjects were studied. Blood flow velocity and pulsatility were determined for the anterior and middle cerebral arteries using transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD). Psychological assessments, which included the psychiatric symptom checklist (SCL-90R), hopelessness (Beck) and well-being (Ellison) questionnaires revealed greater psychiatric distress in HIV+ cocaine abusers than the other groups. HIV- cocaine abusers and HIV+ cocaine abusers not receiving antiviral medications (n=25 of 36) had elevated pulsatility values, indicating increased resistance in the cerebral blood vessels in comparison to control subjects. HIV+ cocaine abusers using antiviral medications (n=11 of 36) had pulsatility values similar to HIV- control subjects. Interestingly, there was no significant relationship between intensity of psychiatric distress reported by HIV+ cocaine abusers and perfusion deficits. Our findings suggest that unmedicated HIV+ cocaine abusers have cerebrovascular deficits, which are similar to HIV- cocaine abusers. In addition, the use of antiviral medications appears to be associated with a reduction of these deficits in HIV+ cocaine abusers. Nevertheless, more studies will be needed before any conclusion can be reached regarding possible beneficial effects of these agents on the cerebral vasculature."

            "abstract": "Depression after stroke is common. Although different opinions exist about the definition, diagnosis, and measurement of outcomes related to depression after stroke, there is little debate about the prevalence of depression symptoms and their impact on stroke survivors and their families. Depression after stroke has long been recognized as a common condition with many negative effects in the poststroke period, but more recently depression has also been identified as an independent stroke risk factor. Given that there are at least 500,000 new ischemic strokes yearly in the United States, a conservative estimate is that 150,000 U.S. stroke survivors develop poststroke depression each year. Because effective treatments exist but are likely underutilized for depression, this is an important example of an evidence-practice gap to which increased efforts to improve care should be made. Such efforts would likely improve not only patient symptoms but may also decrease stroke risk, influence stroke functional recovery, decrease mortality, and reduce poststroke health care utilization. This article provides an overview of depression diagnosis in stroke, reviews the epidemiology of poststroke depression and its associated morbidity and mortality, and reviews existing evidence on the treatment and prevention of poststroke depression."

Participants completed the Geriatric Depression Scale (short form) and were considered depressed if they reported 6 or more of 15 possible symptoms of depression. Women were followed up for an average of 6 years. If a participant died, we obtained a copy of the official death certificate and hospital records, if available, and used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes to classify death attributable to cardiovascular, cancer, or noncancer, noncardiovascular cause.\n## RESULTS\nMortality during 7-year follow-up varied from 7% in women with no depressive symptoms to 17% in those with 3 to 5 symptoms to 24% in those with 6 or more symptoms of depression (P<.001). Of 473 women (6.3%) with 6 or more depressive symptoms at baseline, 24% died (111 deaths in 2610 woman-years of follow-up) compared with 11% of women who reported 5 or fewer symptoms of depression (760 deaths in 41 460 woman-years of follow-up) (P<.001). Women with 6 or more depressive symptoms had a 2-fold increased risk of death (age-adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75-2.61; P<.001) compared with those who had 5 or fewer depressive symptoms. This association remained strong after adjusting for potential confounding variables, including history of myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, perceived health, and cognitive function (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.14-1.88; P=.003).

Patients with denial can express depressive symptoms. Patients with denial had a worse outcome at discharge (chi(2) =4.91, p=.04; U=2918.00; p=.03). Denial is a frequent phenomenon after acute stroke. We propose that there is a multifactorial model for the emergence of denial, lower educational as a predisposing condition, and acute stroke due to hemisphere lesion and causing neglect and cognitive impairment as precipitating events. All these factors limit patients' assessment of their condition and body functions."

Data about risk factors, etiology, side and territory of stroke, social characteristics of the patient (age, sex, profession, educational level, family situation), poststroke seizures, recurrent stroke, other vascular events, and deaths were collected. Neurological deficits were graded with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale. Poststroke depression (PSD) was quantified using the DSM-IIIR criteria and the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Outcomes were rated with the Ranking Scale, the Barthel Index and the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Quality of life was assessed with the Sickness Impact Profile. Follow-up information was obtained by interview and neurological examination. Follow-up information was obtained in 65 patients at a mean of 31.7 +/- 13.0 (range 12-59) months, as 2 patients died and 4 were lost to follow-up and were thus excluded from this study. Poststroke seizures occurred in 7 patients (10.8%) and recurrent strokes in 4 patients (6.2%), but none were fatal. The outcome after stroke among survivors was usually good, since more than two-thirds of the patients (69.8%) reported no problem, 11.1% moderate handicap and one-fifth major handicap. Forty-six patients (73%) returned to work: the time period ranging from several days after stroke to 40 months, with a mean of 8 months. However, adjustments in their occupation were necessary for 12 patients (26.1%). PSD was common, since 48.31% of the patients were classified as depressed. PSD was associated with the localization of the infarct (carotid territory), a severe disability, a bad general outcome, and an absence of return to work. Their opinion about their quality of life was negative among approximately 30% of the patients, especially in emotional and alertness behaviors. social interaction, recreation and pastimes. The general outcome after cerebral infarct in young adults is usually good. However, the risk of a PSD is high, and only half of the patients had returned to their previous work. A remaining psychosocial handicap and depression of sexual activity impaired the quality of life. In multivariate analysis, a low NIH score at admission is a significant predictor for return to work, the absence of PSD, and a good quality of life."

Furthermore, the value of diagnostic instruments and biological markers in identifying depression following stroke has been critically evaluated. In this first part of this two part paper, phenomenological and nosological aspects are considered with an emphasis on symptom profile, significance of vegetative symptoms and other related emotional responses such as catastrophic reaction, emotionalism and apathy in the diagnosis of depression following stroke. The applicability of diagnostic subcategories to define depressive syndromes associated with cerebrovascular disease and its clinical relevance is also discussed.

We have demonstrated that remission of poststroke major depression was associated with improvement in ADL. The administration of antidepressants within the first 3 months after stroke has been shown to prevent poststroke depression, early administration might also improve recovery of ADL among patients with stroke. This study examines the effect of early versus late treatment with antidepressants on recovery in ADL. Among 62 patients after stroke, the therapeutic effect of a 3-month course of antidepressants begun during the first month after stroke was compared with the effect of treatment begun after 1 month. The severity of impairment was measured using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and post-treatment outcome was assessed over the following 21 months. Although both the early and late treatment groups showed improvements in FIM scores during the 3 months of treatment, the early treatment group improved significantly more than the late treatment group. After the treatment, the early treatment group maintained this improvement over 2 years while the late treatment group deteriorated over time. There were no significant differences in the 2 groups that would explain the findings. Recovery in ADL impairment after stroke appeared to be enhanced by the use of antidepressant medication if treatment was started within the first month after stroke. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that there may be a time-related therapeutic window in the treatment of physical impairment associated with poststroke depression."

            "abstract": "In recent years, poststroke depression has attracted worldwide interest. This review focuses on the major research themes that have emerged. Pooled data from studies conducted throughout the world have found prevalence rates for major depression of 19.3% among hospitalized patients and 23.3% among outpatient samples. The diagnosis of poststroke depression is most appropriately based on a structured mental state exam and DSM-IV criteria for depression due to stroke with major depressive-like episode or depressive features. Rarely, poststroke patients may also develop bipolar mood disorder. The treatment of poststroke depression has been examined in several placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials with both nortriptyline and citalopram showing efficacy. The progression of recovery following stroke can be altered by treating depression, which has been shown to improve recovery in activities of daily living and cognitive impairment and to decrease mortality. In addition, two studies have demonstrated that poststroke depression can be prevented using antidepressant medication, which also decreases the frequency of associated physical illness. Furthermore, two studies have shown that premorbid depression can significantly increase the risk of stroke over the subsequent 10-15 years. The mechanisms underlying the association of cerebrovascular diseases and mood disorder are important areas for future investigation."

            "abstract": "Thirty left-handed patients hospitalized for stroke were examined for mood disorders. Patients with left hemisphere lesions and nondominant hand impairments had significantly higher depression scores and more depressive diagnoses than patients with right hemisphere lesions and dominant hand impairments. Major depression was strongly associated with left anterior brain injury, and depression severity was significantly correlated with proximity of the lesion on CAT scan to the left frontal pole. These findings are almost identical to previously reported results from right-handed patients and suggest that cerebral lateralization of poststroke mood disorders may be independent of cerebral motor dominance and language dominance."

Stroke patients frequently represent mood disturbances, cognitive decline, anxiety disorders, and sometimes serious schizophorm or paranoid states. Poststroke depression is the most common and possibly amenable form to therapeutic intervention. Depressive symptoms have negative effect on the rehabilitation process, quality of life and even on long-term survival. Considering drug therapy, in the past decade tricyclic drugs have been replaced by newly developed antidepressants with milder side-effects profile. Our knowledge on the relationship among vascular and other types of dementia has been extended in the recent years. This development also has some therapeutic implications. It seems likely that other psychiatric disorders, psychoses, pathological affect and personality disorders also inhibit recovery and limit long-term quality of life, but available data on this topic is limited."

However, tau levels in AD patients covered a broad range (163.2 pg/ml-1200 pg/ml). AD patients with tau levels below the 25%-percentile of the distribution (among them a high percentage of patients with presenile onset) showed tau levels similar to those of the patients with late life depression. No significant correlations between tau levels and clinical variables such as severity of dementia, age, age of onset, duration of illness, and cerebral changes as assessed by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging could be demonstrated. Similarly, we could not find an influence of either APO-E genotype or psychotropic medication on the tau levels in AD patients. In accordance with other studies our results confirm elevated tau levels in AD compared to elderly not demented control subjects. Comparing groups, this finding applies as well with respect to VD and other dementing disorders. However, elevated tau levels cannot be detected in a subgroup of AD patients. This finding needs to be further investigated in future studies."

Analysis was by multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measures There was a non-significant difference between the groups in their motor and functional scores, and a significant improvement on time. A significant interaction between group and time was seen. This interaction was particularly significant on the Rivermead mobility index, and was due to the fact that the recovery of non-treated depressed patients with stroke was less than the non-depressed and the depressed but treated patients with stroke. Furthermore, recovery from depression was significantly greater in treated than in non-treated depressed patients with stroke.

Sixty-two patients were available for response after 1 year--46 men and 16 women with a mean age of 64 years (SD = 9.2). Time interval between stroke event and admission to rehabilitation unit was 15 days. None of the patients presented with lack of comprehension. Methods of data collection at admission were clinical examination, computed tomographic scan or magnetic resonance imaging, the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, laboratory data, and data collection on sexual life from patients and, separately, from their partners. After 1 year, they were interviewed again to assess sexual performance; the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, and Functional Independence Measure were also performed.

Age (p =.009) and disability (p =.0059) were significant variables. There was no correlation between sexual decline and gender, nor injured hemisphere. There was also no correlation to marriage duration, education duration, or depression. Evaluation and analysis of the questionnaires revealed, however, that patients' partners played a substantial role in the decline of sexual activity.

A research assistant administered the HADS-D to 100 Chinese patients with acute stroke who were consecutively admitted to a general hospital. A psychiatrist, who was blind to the HADS-D scores, administered the SCID-DSM-III-R to all 100 patients and made a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression, which served as the benchmark for judging the performance of the HADS-D in screening for depression. Rasch analysis has shown that the HADS-D was unidimensional; low endorsements for the higher coded alternative response categories were found in the sample. In clinical samples with a low frequency of depression, the scoring categories of the HADS-D may be reduced."

We therefore evaluated the presence of neuroendocrine changes in the acute and post-acute phase of SMS, and their potential role during convalescence. Serum cortisol, T4, T3, FT4, FT3, TSH and PRL levels were measured in 17 euthyroid patients with stroke on admission (day 1), following morning (day 2), 7 days and 3 months later. TSH and PRL secretion after TRH test were measured. Stroke severity on admission was determined by Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS). Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (Madrs) was used for assessment of post-stroke depression. On admission, TSH and T3, were within normal limits and were greater compared to values on day 2. Lower basal TSH and decreased TSH response to TRH on day 2, were associated with stroke of greater severity. Delta-PRL after TRH on day 2 was higher in patients who develop PSD. Changes in serum thyroid hormones in SMS, reflects those of non-thyroidal illness. A mild stimulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was detected. We provide evidence that PRL response to TRH, in the acute phase of stroke may be used as an index for early detection of PSD."

The majority of falls occurred indoors at home. Independent factors associated with falls were depressive symptoms, disability, previous falls, and older age. For injurious falls, the positively associated factors were female sex and NZ/European ethnicity and dependence before the stroke, whereas higher levels of activity and normal cognition were negatively associated factors.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Falls are common after stroke, and their predictive factors are similar to those for older people in general.

            "abstract": "The patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a controversial risk factor for CVA or TIA. In our center, adult PFO patients diagnosed with post cryptogenic CVA/TIA undergo trans-catheter closure of the PFO to decrease the risk of recurrent stroke. The aim of the study was to compare levels of functioning, depression and anxiety in post PFO closure patients following cryptogenic CVA/TIA and in other patients post CVA/TIA without PFO. Eighty-nine patients who had undergone trans-catheter PFO closure and 56 non-PFO post-CVA patients completed demographic, functioning, anxiety and depression questionnaires. Additional medical data were recorded from the medical files. Patients who had undergone trans-catheter PFO closure post CVA or TIA reported better level of functioning and substantially lower levels of depression and anxiety. The 70% of depression and 55% of anxiety variances were explained by female gender, older age, lower education, lower functioning level and additional health problems. Functioning level was the strongest contributor to the explained variance of psychological symptoms. We conclude that patients who have undergone trans-catheter PFO closure following cryptogenic CVA/TIA, which may prevent stroke recurrence, show good functioning and low levels of psychological symptoms. The procedure helps to keep these patients in a good physical and psychological health."

The following factors were found to have prognostic significance: 1) Lesion Location: proximity of the lesion on CT scan to the frontal pole in patients with left anterior infarcts showed a strong positive relationship with severity of depression at one year but not at two years poststroke. 2) Affective Status: depression (in-hospital and at 6 months) strongly predicted depression at one year but not at two years poststroke. Additionally, in-hospital depression significantly correlated with physical impairment at two years, while depression at six months bore a moderate relationship to physical impairment at one year. 3) Physical Impairment: impairment in activities of daily living in-hospital bore a modest relationship to depression at one year while such impairment at six months correlated strongly with depression at both one and two years. These findings may reflect the natural course of major depression which remits between one and two years poststroke. Although stroke lesion location is the strongest predictor of subsequent depression, there appears to be a reciprocal relationship between physical impairment and depression (i.e., depression predicts impairment and impairment predicts depression). Since poststroke depressions are amenable to therapeutic intervention, these prognostic factors may have implications for the treatment and rehabilitation of stroke patients."

            "abstract": "Depression may occur as a result of vascular disease in a significant subpopulation of elderly persons. Indirect support for vascular disease as an underlying etiology of late-life depression includes the high rate of depression in patients with vascular disease, the frequency of \"silent stroke\" and white-matter hyperintensities in late-life depression, and the lower frequency of positive family histories of depression in such patients. The authors evaluate the associations of late-life depression with cerebrovascular disease by reviewing the existing pathophysiological, prognosis, and treatment-outcomes studies. Findings are based on review of the current literature systematically searched in electronic databases. Review of such studies indicates a high frequency of depression in older patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and the possibility of a bidirectional relationship between depression and vascular disease. Studies examining patients with vascular depression have found that such patients have different symptom profiles, greater disability, and higher risk for poorer outcomes than those with nonvascular depression. Since the vascular depression hypothesis was proposed as a conceptual framework, evidence has accumulated that patients with vascular depression may have poorer outcomes that may be related in part to executive dysfunction and consequent disability. However, the association of vascular risk factors with geriatric depression has not been consistent in the studies to-date. Although an association between a subset of late-life depression and vascular disease is clear, significant gaps remain in our understanding. Further research is needed to establish the precise linkages and interactions between vascular disease and geriatric depression."

Particularly closely studied since the beginning of the eighties, PCVAD is considered a therapeutic entity in its own right by many authors. The clinical picture is one of melancholia in 5 to 25% of cases, and of minor or masked depression (with psychomotor retardation and somatic disorders predominating) in 75 to 95% of cases. Etiopathogenesis varies depending on post-CVA period: during the first few months, the depletion of intra-cerebral neurotransmitters is considered to play a dominant role; subsequently, difficulty in coping with the handicap would appear to be the main factor. The diagnostic scales which may be used are CIM 10 or DSM IV. For quantification, Hamilton's, the MADRS, Zung's or the CESD scales may be used. There is as yet no scale specific to PCVAD. The therapeutic approach still remains empirical, due to the rarity of published studies. Tricyclic antidepressants and inadvisable as first-line treatment due to their anticholinergic effects. Serotoninergic agents are well tolerated, but their efficacy is currently insufficiently documented, despite a recent study. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been tried, with a certain degree of success, by some authors, but no controlled study is currently available. Personal and familial psychological management would appear necessary but this has not yet been validated. In a preliminary, open-label study in 15 patients presenting with PCVAD, the authors obtained normalization of the MADRS in 10 cases following 6 weeks of treatment with fluoxetine (Prozac). No adverse effects were observed. A multicenter, controlled study is currently ongoing in Bordeaux, France."

            "abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) is a central neurotransmitter and a neuromodulator. This amine is involved in many physiological functions and pathological disorders. Most of its effects are mediated by specific 5-HT receptors. In the first part of this paper, the present knowledge of 5-HT receptors is reviewed in terms of both pharmacology and molecular biology. In the second part, the functional properties of 5-HT receptors are analyzed and their involvement in pathophysiological processes is discussed. Most 5-HT receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor family (5-HT1, 5-HT2 and 5-HT4 receptors), whereas one is a member of the ligand-gated ion-channel receptor family (5-HT3 receptor). 5-HT1 receptors are characterized by their high affinity for 5-HT and comprise several subclasses. Most are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase but the 5-HT1C subtype is linked to phospholipase C activation and resembles the 5-HT2 receptor. By contrast, the newly identified 5-HT4 receptor is positively coupled to adenylate cyclase. Most 5-HT receptors have now been cloned, but their physiological roles are not completely understood. Better knowledge of 5-HT receptors has already led to the development of new drugs, such as buspirone, a 5-HT1A partial agonist devoid of benzodiazepine-like properties for the treatment of generalized anxiety. Anxiolytic properties have also been reported for 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. A new and potent anti-migrainous drug, sumatriptan, has recently been selected among compounds obtained by research on the 5-HT1D receptor. This key receptor controls the release of monoamines, amino acids and peptides, and new drugs are expected in the near future. The therapeutic potential of 5-HT3 antagonists is impressive, as these compounds have potent antiemetic, promnesic and antipsychotic properties in various animal models. Two such drugs have already been marketed for the prevention of radiation-induced emesis (ondansetron and granisetron) and are more potent than the antidopaminergic drugs. Many other data suggest that 5-HT receptors might be involved in other illnesses. Some drugs are in the development phase but identification of the relevant receptor is often difficult. Furthermore, the lak of specific ligands for some receptors clearly hinders functional correlations."

Depressive symptoms were assessed at multiple time points by a Mental Health Index score (1992, 1996, and 2000), and clinical significant depressive symptoms were defined as a score≤52. Antidepressant medication use was asked biennially beginning in 1996, and physician-diagnosed depression was reported biennially beginning in 2000. Depression was defined as currently reporting or having a history of any of these 3 conditions.\n## RESULTS\nDuring 6 years of follow-up, 1033 incident strokes were documented (538 ischemic, 124 hemorrhagic, and 371 unknown strokes). Having a history of depression was associated with a multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.29 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.48) for total stroke. Women who used antidepressant medications were at increased risk for stroke, whether they also had a Mental Health Index score≤52 or diagnosed depression (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.15-1.69) or not (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03-1.67). Furthermore, for each cycle, participants who reported current depression had an increased risk of stroke (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.18-1.67), whereas individuals who only had a history of depression were at nonsignificantly elevated risk (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.97-1.56) compared with women who never reported a diagnosis of depression or antidepressant medication use.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that depression is associated with a moderately increased risk of subsequent stroke.\n"

There were 118 stroke patients in the present study and 25 patients (21.2%) satisfied the diagnostic criteria for major depressive syndrome of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition Revised (DSM-III-R). As for dispositional, social, and somatic factors, a tendency was observed for depressive state to develop at a high frequency among patients with a past history of mental disorder prior to development of stroke, patients residing in suburban area, patients engaged in domestic and agricultural work, and patients with a frequent history of physical disorders. A tendency was observed for depressive state to develop at a high frequency among patients showing B type in YG test and patients presenting laterality in electroencephalography. Among the 49 right stroke patients, depressive state was observed in 10 cases (20.4%), while among the 43 left stroke patients, depressive state was seen in 10 cases (23.2%) with the incidence of depressive state showing no difference by hemisphere stroke. Study of the clinical characteristics of depressive state by hemisphere stroke with the use of symptom items of Zung scale and Hamilton scale showed that patients in depressive state with right hemisphere stroke had high values in symptom items considered close to the essence of endogenous depression such as depressed mood, suicide, diurnal variation, loss of weight, and paranoid symptoms, while patients in depressive state with left hemisphere stroke had high values in symptom items having a nuance of so-called neurotic depression such as psychic anxiety, hypochondriasis, and fatigue. Comparison with endogenous depression patients indicated that right stroke patients rather than left stroke patients showed a clinical picture suggestive of endogenous depression. Antidepressant was effective in 71.4% of the cases, but no difference in effectiveness could be observed by hemisphere stroke. In stroke patients in the chronic stage the incidence of clinical depressive state was higher than 20%, and involved in its onset were not only brain organ lesions but also dispositional, social, and somatic factors and integration dysfunction in the emotional activity of the left and right hemisphere functions. As for the clinical picture, a picture considered close to endogenous depression was observed in right stroke patients, while that considered close to so-called neurotic depression was seen in left stroke patients. The therapeutic effect of antidepressant was almost equivalent to that for endogenous depression."

            "abstract": "Dual-action antidepressants serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SRNIs) are widely used to treat depression. Owing to its efficiency and safety, venlafaxine holds a prominent place in this group of depressants. Abrupt venlafaxine discontinuation involves a high risk of withdrawal syndrome. Mechanism of its development is similar to that of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but of higher intensity. Venlafaxine withdrawal symptoms may include several somatic symptoms as well as several psychiatric symptoms. In some cases, symptoms may look like a stroke. A treatment option is re-inclusion of venlafaxine or a SSRI antidepressant. The paper presents the case of a 70-year-old patient who discontinued of her own accord to take venlafaxine, which she had been taking regularly at a daily dose of 225 mg for more than a year. A few hours after taking the last dose, withdrawal syndrome occurred with severe symptoms resembling a stroke. The patient was examined by a neurologist and the CT and laboratory parameters showed no irregularities. Diagnosis was made after psychiatric observation. Venlafaxine, 150 mg per day, was prescribed, the symptoms disappeared relatively quickly, and the patient fully recovered. Withdrawal syndrome is a real risk for each venlafaxine treated patient. The possibility of its occurrence should be always kept in mind and patients should be timely informed about it. In this way, the risk of venlafaxine withdraw syndrome could be reduced, unnecessary stress to patients prevented and the costs of medical treatment lowered."

Additionally, we divided the patients into a younger (less than 60 years old) and an older (60 or over) group to examine the effect of age.

Although post-stroke (<or=1 year) dementia rates were heterogeneous overall, 93% of the variance was explained by study methods and case mix; the rates ranged from 7.4% (4.8-10.0) in population-based studies of first-ever stroke in which pre-stroke dementia was excluded to 41.3% (29.6-53.1) in hospital-based studies of recurrent stroke in which pre-stroke dementia was included. The cumulative incidence of dementia after the first year was little greater (3.0%, 1.3-4.7) per year in hospital-based studies than expected on the basis of recurrent stroke alone.

            "abstract": "In a prospective study of mood disorders in stroke patients, variables obtained during the acute hospitalization were examined for their relationship to outcome at either 3- or 6-month follow-up. Distance of the lesion on computerized axial tomography scan from the frontal pole in patients with left anterior infarcts was significantly associated with severity of depression at 3 and 6 months poststroke. In addition, intellectual and functional physical impairment in-hospital were significantly correlated with severity of depression and social functioning scores at 3 and 6 months poststroke. Thus, patients who develop depression during the first 6 months poststroke may be responding to the severity of their impairment whereas the patients who develop depressions during the acute poststroke period may have a neuroanatomical and neurophysiological basis for their depression. Although other explanations might be proposed, the dynamic nature of the relationship between depression and associated variables during the first 6 months poststroke indicates that etiology of poststroke depression may be different depending upon the time of onset of the depression after brain injury."

Logistic Regression analysis was used to estimate Odds Ratios and 95% Confidence Intervals (OR, 95%CI) for CIND. The diagnostic procedure identified 402 (5.4%) CIND cases. Diabetes (OR, 95%CI = 1.6, 1.2-2.2), stroke (OR, 95%CI = 1.9, 1.4-2.6), and depressive symptoms (OR, 95%CI = 1.9, 1.4-2.7) emerged as the most relevant medical comorbidities of CIND.

In comparison to subjects without any of the above mentioned conditions, subjects with one medical and one social factor had an OR, 95%CI for CIND equal to 6.0, 2.9-12.4. The strength of the association increased when more of those conditions occurred in combination, suggesting a synergistic effect. Despite some methodological limitations, data from this cross-sectional population-based Italian study show that low education, low SES, unmarried status together with diabetes, stroke, and depressive symptoms are related to cognitive impairment in the general population.

However, depression and anxiety are often not detected or inadequately treated. This may in part be due to doubts about whether anti-depressant treatments commenced early after the onset of stroke will prevent depression and improve outcome.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine if pharmaceutical or psychological interventions can prevent the onset of depression, including depressive illness and abnormal mood, and improve physical and psychological outcomes, in patients with stroke.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (June 2003). In addition we searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2002), EMBASE (1980 to September 2002), CINAHL (1982 to September 2002), PsychINFO (1967 to September 2002), Applied Science and Technology Plus (1986 to September 2002), Arts and Humanities Index (1991 to September 2002), Biological Abstracts (1969 to September 2002), General Science Plus (1994 to September 2002), Science Citation Index (1992 to September 2002), Social Sciences Citation Index (1991 to September 2002), and Sociofile (1974 to September 2002). Reference lists from relevant articles and textbooks were searched, and authors of known studies and pharmaceutical companies who manufacture psychotropic medications were contacted.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different types of pharmaceutical agents (eg selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) with placebo, or various forms of psychotherapy against standard care (or attention control), in patients with a recent clinical diagnosis of stroke, where the treatment was undertaken with the explicit intention of preventing depression.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      The primary analyses focussed on the proportion of patients who met the standard diagnostic criteria for depression applied in the trials at the end of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included depression or mood scores on standard scales, disability or physical function, death, recurrent stroke, and adverse effects.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Twelve trials involving 1245 participants were included in the review. Data were available for nine trials (11 comparisons) involving different pharmaceutical agents, and three trials of psychotherapy. The time from stroke onset to entry ranged from a few hours to six months, but most patients were recruited within one month of acute stroke. The duration of treatments ranged from two weeks to one year. There was no clear effect of pharmacological therapy on the prevention of depression or on other measures. A significant improvement in mood was evident for psychotherapy, but this treatment effect was small and from a single trial. There was no effect on diagnosed depression.\n    \n\n\n          Reviewers' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This review identified a small but significant effect of psychotherapy on improving mood, but no effect of either pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy on the prevention of depressive illness, disability, or other outcomes. More evidence is therefore required before any recommendations can be made about the routine use of such treatments to improve recovery after stroke."

From the regional database of prescriptions reimbursed by the National Health Service, we extracted all patients aged 65 years or above who received antidepressant prescriptions during 2001. The two databases were linked anonymously using the individual patient code. The analysis showed that the proportion of cerebrovascular events in those exposed to SSRIs was 135/66 335 [0.20%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.24], whereas the proportion of cerebrovascular accidents in those exposed to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) was 28/18 620 (0.15%, 95% CI 0.09-0.21). After background group differences were controlled for, exposure to SSRIs did not increase the risk of accidents (adjusted odds ratio 1.31, 95% CI 0.87-1.97). Although the risk of cerebrovascular accidents is a rare but serious event that should carefully be monitored during antidepressant therapy, this study indicated an absence of difference between TCAs and SSRIs."

The authors outline an approach to therapy that expands upon the fundamental principles of the MRI (Mental Research Institute) Brief Therapy model, elaborating more upon its constructivist premises than its prescriptive practices. They propose that by mapping how ordinary life events affect a person's preferred view, the therapist can locate the key narrative elements that shape the course of the problem and direct its solution. The authors suggest a framework for how problems evolve and dissolve. When new events are construed as contradicting family members' preferred narrative accounts, problems evolve. Problems dissolve when family members see the event, and the ideas and actions of others, as consonant with their preferred ways of being and acting."

Half of the 28 patients who entered the trial 2 to 6 weeks after stroke recovered within 1 month, independent of the treatment given. This indicates a high degree of spontaneous recovery in the early phase after stroke. In contrast, recovery was infrequent in placebo group patients who became depressed 7 weeks or more after stroke.

Six months after stroke standardised psychiatric assessment disclosed that 26% of the patients met DSM-IV criteria for an anxiety or depressive disorder, with depression the most common diagnosis (20%). Pathological emotionalism was diagnosed in 18% of patients, particularly those who were depressed (p<0.0001).

Additionally, we retrospectively reviewed all charts for the presence of clinical criteria of vascular depression. Neuropathological evaluation included bilateral semi-quantitative assessment of lacunes, deep white matter and periventricular demyelination, cortical microinfarcts and both focal and diffuse gliosis.

The difficulty to discriminate depression from AD is largely overestimated due to the confusion between depression, depressive symptomatology and apathy. The distinction is greatly facilitated by taking into account the qualitative differences of the memory deficits and cerebral imagery. Distinction of depression from frontotemporal or subcortical dementias could be much more difficult. Relationships between depression and AD are controversial. Most reports of depression as a risk factor for AD in the subsequent years, actually describe depressed symptomatology linked to apathy in preclinical AD. However, some studies found a relationship between AD and depression occurring more than 10 years before the onset of AD symptomatology, suggesting some common risk factors. The so-called symptoms of depression in AD are more related to apathy and affective disturbances than to dysphoria. The frequency of major depressive episode (MDE), greatly varies according to studies, but the frequency of suicide is low. Depression in dementia is related to neurobiological factors as well as to psychological mechanisms. Therefore, its treatment should associate antidepressant drugs and psychological support directed to the patient and family."

The standard diagnostic criteria often are not applicable since the neurological lesion may distort or even obliterate salient features of depression. Patients actually may deny being depressed or dysphoric, not have a depressive affect, or be totally unaware of abnormal vegetative behaviors. Furthermore, brain lesions themselves may produce striking behavioral alterations that can be mistakenly attributed to depression, or striking behavioral changes due to depression may be mistakenly attributed to the brain lesion. Based on five case studies, several clinical guidelines for recognizing and diagnosing depression in brain-damaged patients are offered. These cases also provide a data base to generate initial hypotheses about the neuroanatomical basis of the depressive syndrome. By observing how focal brain lesions modify the signs and symptoms of depression, inferences are made about brain areas crucial for modulating the various features of the depressive syndrome."

In the whole group repeated measures ANOVAs revealed a highly significant (p < 0.0001) time effect for HDRS and MMSE scores. However, depression improved much more in right stroke subjects in comparison with left stroke subjects (p < 0.001 for the HDRS by laterality interaction). Moreover, there is a suggestion of a possible selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) efficacy in cognitive impairment associated to post-stroke MDD but in treatment-responders only. At the endpoint, chi-square analysis showed that there was a different prevalence rate of MDD between left (n = 10; 50 %) and right (n = 4; 16 %) stroke patients, whereas the prevalence rate of Minor Depression was identical (25 %). The SSRIs fluoxetine and sertraline could be efficacious treatments for post-stroke MDD but these findings suggest that left stroke could be a predictor of treatment resistance."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\ndepression is common in elderly people and may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk and incident dementia.\n## METHOD\nparticipants in the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) completed a depression screening instrument, the Geriatric Depression Score (GDS), at baseline and annually. We examined the association of GDS score with incident stroke, mortality and dementia using Cox proportional hazards models (hazard ratios, HR and 95% confidence intervals, CI) adjusted for treatment group and other potential confounders.\n## RESULTS\n2,656 HYVET participants completed the GDS. The mean follow-up was 2.1 years. A GDS score > or =6 was associated with increased risks of all-cause (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.3) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.5-3.0), all stroke (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.8) and all cardiovascular events (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1). Risk of incident dementia also tended to be increased (HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.95-1.73). Each additional GDS point at baseline also gave rise to a significantly increased risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality and dementia.\n## CONCLUSION\nthere was a strong association between baseline depression scores and later fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular endpoints over a mean follow-up of 2 years in a hypertensive very elderly group. The mechanism of this association warrants further study.\n"

            "abstract": "Although post-stroke depression occurs with lesions to either cortical hemisphere, increasing evidence supports the view that depression is more prevalent after left hemispheric damage. This retrospective study of depressed post-stroke inpatients referred for psychiatric consultation shows a significantly higher referral rate for patients with right-hemispheric lesions. The results suggest an underutilization of psychiatric consultation to patients with left-sided lesions, and perhaps underrecognition of affective disorders in these patients. Various reasons for this underutilization are proposed, including the greater likelihood of speech impairment in left-sided brain-damaged stroke patients, who may have greater difficulty verbally communicating their psychic distress. Increased physician awareness of the clinical presentations of post-stroke depression will result in more patients benefitting from available treatments."

            "abstract": "Although poststroke depression is unlikely to represent a single disorder and numerous etiologies for different kinds of poststroke depression will likely emerge as the result of future research, we believe that a number of poststroke depressive disorders are likely to be the result of specific changes in brain pathology and neurophysiology. Nevertheless, there are relatively few hypotheses about the pathophysiology of poststroke depression. This paper, therefore, proposes a new hypothesis for poststroke depression involving increased production of proinflammatory cytokines resulting from brain ischemia in cerebral areas linked to the pathogenesis of mood disorders. This paper reviews the evidence supporting the hypothesis that proinflammatory cytokines are involved in the occurrence of stroke as well as mood disorders linked to the brain damage. The increased production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, TNF-alpha or IL-18 resulting from stroke may lead to an amplification of the inflammatory process, particularly in limbic areas, and widespread activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and subsequently to depletion of serotonin in paralimbic regions such as the ventral lateral frontal cortex, polar temporal cortex and basal ganglia. The resultant physiological dysfunction may lead to poststroke depression. Future investigations may explore this hypothesis through more extensive studies on the role of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1beta, TNF-alpha or even IL-18, in patients with poststroke depression."

            "abstract": "Owing to the lack of instruments specifically constructed to study emotional and affective disorders of stroke patients, the nature of post-stroke depression (PSD) remains controversial. With this in mind, the authors constructed a new scale, the Post-Stroke Depression Scale (PSDS) which takes into account a series of symptoms and problems commonly observed in depressed stroke patients. The PSDS and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDS) were administered to a group of 124 patients, who had been classified, on the basis of DSM III-R diagnostic criteria, in the following categories: No depression (n = 32); Minor PSD (n = 47); Major PSD (n = 45). Scores obtained by these stroke patients on the PSDS and on the HDS were compared to those obtained on the same scales by 17 psychiatric patients also classified as major depression on the basis of DSM III-R diagnostic criteria. An analysis of the symptomatological profiles clearly showed that: (1) a continuum exists between the so-called \"major\" and \"minor\" forms of PSD; (2) in both groups of depressed stroke patients the depressive symptomatology seems due to the psychological reaction to the devastating consequences of stroke, since the motivated aspects of depression prevailed in depressed stroke patients, whereas the (biologically determined) unmotivated aspects prevailed in patients with a functional form of major depression; and (3) in stroke patients a DSM III-based diagnosis of major PSD could be in part inflated by symptoms (such as apathy and vegetative disorders) that are typical of major depression in a patient free from brain damage, but that could be due to the brain lesion per se in a stroke patient."

The primary predictors of overall burden for the combined sample were caregiver and patient depression and insufficient social support.

The diagnostic uncertainty is aggravated by the lack of appropriate diagnostic criteria for PSD in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) used in Germany. For the first time, we present an algorithm, which allows for a standardized examination of stroke patients on the presence of PSD. All stroke patients should be examined initially by a short and simple screening tool and are subjected to more extensive procedures only if PSD is assumed based on the screening result. Furthermore potentials and limitations to convert the diagnosis of PSD into a diagnostic related group (DRG) that is used to calculate the hospital's reimbursement are highlighted.

Results obtained were used (a) to analyze the profiles of cognitive impairment shown by the different dementia groups; (b) to assess the incidence of some neuropsychological patterns that we hypothesized to be more characteristic of AD, in the various groups; and hence (c) to evaluate the reliability of these patterns as diagnostic markers of AD. Four of the patterns investigated were derived from a verbal learning task (Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning test): (1) absence of the primacy effect; (2) tendency to produce intrusion errors during free recall of a word list; (3) absolute decay of memory trace; and (4) tendency to produce false alarms during delayed recognition of the same word list. Two additional patterns were derived from visual-spatial tasks (copying drawings and Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices): (5) occurrence of the closing-in phenomenon in copying drawings; and (6) tendency to choose globalistic or odd responses in Raven's matrices. Though all the six patterns were somewhat useful for identifying AD patients, no pattern met the criteria of being both highly sensitive and highly specific, which should characterize an ideal marker. In fact, intrusions and false alarms were observed in many AD patients, but also in patients affected by other forms of dementia. The absence of the primacy effect, the closing-in phenomenon, and the absolute decay of memory trace were more specific, but could be observed in only one-third of AD patients. We also computed the number of positive patterns shown by each patient and assumed the presence of two or more patterns as a global index suggestive of a dementia of the Alzheimer type.

The second patient was a 46-year-old white woman with a history of recurrent depression who developed delirium and ischemic stroke while she was taking a combination of paroxetine 50 mg/day, trazodone 200 mg/day, and bupropion 150 mg/day.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Carotid and cardiothromboembolism were found to be the major etiological factors for ischemic stroke. Accounting for the temporal relation, prior reports of SSRI treatment-associated CV-ADRs, and the pharmacologic action of serotonin on coagulation and the vascular system, the possible contribution of SSRIs to stroke in these patients was considered. An objective causality assessment using the Naranjo probability scale revealed that a CV-ADR was possible. However, the nature of the stroke, plus clinical and radiologic findings, were inconsistent with known pathophysiologic mechanisms linking SSRIs and stroke in these patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Causality assessment may improve unbiased recognition, management, and voluntary reporting of infrequent adverse effects such as SSRI treatment-related cerebrovascular accident."

The predictors of ischemic stroke have not been well defined, although hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and previous stroke have been consistently reported. We report on 98 months' follow-up in a prospective study of cardiovascular disease in the Australian elderly, the Dubbo Study.\n## METHODS\nThe cohort, first examined in 1988, was composed of 2805 men and women 60 years and older. The prediction of ischemic stroke by potential risk factors was examined in a Cox proportional hazards model, after linkage to hospital and death records.\n## RESULTS\nThree hundred six men and women manifested an ischemic stroke event (ICD-9-CM 433 to 437), and 95 subjects suffered a fatal stroke event. In the multivariate model, the significant independent predictors of stroke were advancing age, female sex (48% lower risk), being married (30% lower risk), prior history of stroke (227% higher risk), use of antihypertensive drugs (37% higher risk), belonging to the highest category of blood pressure reading (67% higher risk), presence of atrial fibrillation (58% higher risk), HDL cholesterol (36% lower risk for each 1-mmol/L increment), impaired peak expiratory flow (77% higher risk for tertile I than for tertile III), physical disability (59% higher risk), and depression score (41% higher risk for tertile III than for tertile I).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese findings suggest that morbidity and mortality associated with ischemic stroke can be predicted by various clinical indicators, some of which may be amenable to intervention. The matters of impaired peak expiratory flow, depression score, and ischemic stroke require further study.\n"

            "abstract": "Although the pathophysiology of depression is not fully understood in either primary depression (i.e., no known neuropathology related to depression) or secondary depression (i.e., neuropathologic disorder that leads to depression), a number of studies have begun to identify aspects of the pathophysiology of both primary and secondary depression. This article reviews the findings of studies examining the pathophysiology of depression following stroke, Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease and compares them to findings in primary depression. Studies examining glucose metabolic rates or blood flow changes in regional brain areas found that stroke, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, as well as primary depression, were all associated with decreased activity or brain lesions in the orbital frontal cortex and basal ganglia. There were also abnormalities noted in the basal temporal lobes, cingulate cortex, and thalamus in some but not all disorders. Studies in stroke have also noted depletions of serotonin receptors in left temporal cortex associated with depression. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the pathophysiology of secondary and primary depression involves the dysfunction of one or more of the cortical-basal ganglia-thalamic neuronal loops. This dysfunction may be mediated by decreased serotonin release. These studies may ultimately lead to more focused and specific treatments."

This study used subjects with a history of major depression and matched comparison subjects, screened to exclude cerebrovascular risk factors, to determine whether depressed subjects had more white matter hyperintensities and other lesions. We evaluated the prevalence and severity of MRI signal hyperintensities in 30 elderly depressed patients and 20 controls matched for age. Deep matter hyperintensities, periventricular hyperintensities and subcortical gray hyperintensities were rated on a standard 0-3 scale by two radiologists blind to clinical diagnosis. No significant differences were found between groups for the presence of subcortical gray matter, deep white matter and periventricular hyperintensities.

Validating a diagnostic entity on the basis of external validity is problematic, because it presupposes that the construct is well defined (i.e., the proposed features cluster together to define a distinct patient group). Because such evidence has not been obtained, we propose that the next critical step in evaluating this potential subtype is to establish internal (construct) validity and highlight taxometric analysis and latent class cluster analysis as illustrative multivariate statistical techniques that can be used in this effort. The psychometric approach advocated here (despite its inherent assumptions and limitations) might substantially improve on previous diagnostic efforts (e.g., expert consensus), and vascular depression might serve as a prototype for future psychiatric classification."

Data are from the East Boston, Massachusetts; New Haven, Connecticut; and Iowa sites of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, conducted between 1982 and 1988. Age-adjusted site-and gender-specific analyses were conducted, unadjusted and adjusted for baseline health status. There was no consistent association, cross-sectionally or longitudinally, between depressive symptoms and blood pressure control. Rates of stroke were 2.3 to 2.7 times higher in most subgroups with high depressive symptomatology in contrast to their nondepressed counterparts. Rates of cardiovascular disease-related death were also elevated in most subgroups, achieving statistical significance in women from New Haven and Iowa. This study presents evidence that high depressive symptoms in older adults with diagnosed hypertension may place them at increased risk of stroke and possibly cardiovascular-related death relative to other elderly persons with diagnosed hypertension.

This review investigates the risk factors and the state of the art of the treatment for poststroke depression, in order to stimulate its detection and adequate treatment by the physician. The point prevalence of Major Depression after stroke varies from 10% to 34%, varying according to differences among the research methods. The length of poststroke period, characteristics of the sample, type of treatment received by patients and diagnostic criteria used can influence the reported prevalence of poststroke depression. The risk factors that have been associated with the occurrence of poststroke depression, are: functional and cognitive impairment, previous history of depression and stroke, sex, age, hypercortisolism, poor social support and stroke neuroanatomic correlates. This one has supported the formulation of a pathophysiological mechanism for poststroke depression related with prefrontosubcortical circuits and neurotransmission of biogenic amines. The depression has a harmful impact on stroke prognosis. It can cause a more severe functional impairment, retardation of the rehabilitation process, outcome complications, and a higher mortality risk. In addition, poststroke depression has not been accurately diagnosed and treated. With the advantage of the magnetic resonance, researchers should focus investigations on the association of specific cerebral regions with the depressive manifestation and treatment response.

A total of 75,131 subjects comprised these studies, with 11,910 women and 62,899 men.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of depression among women was higher in 35 studies. Moreover, the prevalence was generally higher among inpatient populations (both in acute-care and rehabilitation facilities) than in community-dwelling subjects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      PSD is highly prevalent in both sexes, but appears to be slightly more common among women than men. Untreated depression after stroke can lead to a reduced quality of life, poorer prognosis, and increased mortality. All stroke patients should be routinely screened for depression, and further research is needed to determine whether there are sex-specific differences in response to treatment."

            "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram in treating post-stroke depression. A six-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial was undertaken. Diagnosis and outcome were determined using the Hamilton Depression Scale, and unwanted effects were measured using the UKU side effect rating scale. Sixty-six consecutive depressed patients entered the trial 2-52 weeks post-stroke. They were assigned to equally sized treatment and placebo groups. The initial level of depression and demographic parameters were comparable in the two groups. Significantly greater improvement was seen in patients treated with citalopram (10-40 mg/day) for three and six weeks. Half of the 28 patients who entered the trial two to six weeks post-stroke recovered within a month, independent of the treatment given. This indicates a high degree of spontaneous recovery in the early phase after stroke. In contrast, placebo recovery was infrequent in patients who started treatment seven weeks or more post-stroke. No serious side effects related to the treatment were detected, those present being mild and usually transient. The trial demonstrates that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram offers an advantageous new treatment of post-stroke depression that is both safe and effective."

The battery consisted of tests for immediate, recent and remote memory, the Mini Mental State examination, a screening test for language disorders, and tests measuring abstraction, calculation, judgement, praxic and gnosic functions. The results showed significant differences among the three groups in all memory tests. Deficits of abstraction, calculation, praxis and language functions were strongly associated with dementia. The epidemiological analysis of efficiency increment, with determination of sensitivity and specificity, showed a highly significant enhancement of efficiency for diagnostic purposes when the results of the tests were combined. These findings suggest that the entire battery of neuropsychological tests should be applied, and their results compared using the efficiency increment procedure, in order to establish a firm differential diagnosis between dementia and depression, and/or to detect the former when it is at a mild early stage."

            "abstract": "One third of all stroke survivors develop post-stroke depression (PSD). Depressive symptoms adversely affect rehabilitation and significantly increase risk of death in the post-stroke period. One of the theoretical views on the determinants of PSD focuses on psychosocial factors like disability and social support. Others emphasize biologic mechanisms such as disruption of biogenic amine neurotransmission and release of proinflammatory cytokines. The \"lesion location\" perspective attempts to establish a relationship between localization of stroke and occurrence of depression, but empirical results remain contradictory. These divergences are partly related to the fact that neuroimaging methods, unlike neuropathology, are not able to assess precisely the full extent of stroke-affected areas and do not specify the different types of vascular lesions. We provide here an overview of the known phenomenological profile and current pathogenic hypotheses of PSD and present neuropathological data challenging the classic \"single-stroke\"-based neuroanatomical model of PSD. We suggest that vascular burden due to the chronic accumulation of small macrovascular and microvascular lesions may be a crucial determinant of the development and evolution of PSD."

These lesions have been hypothesized to be ischemic in origin, but there have been no previous neuropathological studies in depression. We investigated the neuropathological basis of these lesions in depression, hypothesizing that they would be more frequently ischemic in origin in depressed subjects.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We carried out in vitro magnetic resonance imaging on 3 slices of brain tissue (2 frontal, 1 occipital) from 20 elderly subjects who had a history of major depression and 20 elderly controls. The films were blindly rated, and sections were prepared for neuropathological analysis from the same slices and stained conventionally and by means of immunohistochemistry for microglia, macrophages, and astroglia. Lesions on the films were identified in the tissue, blindly described neuropathologically, and subsequently divided into ischemic and nonischemic lesions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All the deep white matter hyperintensities in the depressed group were found to be ischemic, compared with less than a third of those in the control group, a highly significant difference (P<.001). This difference was due to smaller punctate lesions (<3 mm), which were predominantly ischemic in depressed subjects but not in control subjects. Larger lesions were usually ischemic in both groups. Compared with control subjects, ischemic lesions were significantly more likely to be in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared with the anterior cingulate cortex (P =.003) and the occipital cortex (P =.01) in the depressed subjects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Deep white matter hyperintensities are more frequently due to cerebral ischemia, and such ischemic lesions are more frequently located at the level of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in depressed subjects.

We evaluated long-term mortality risk associated with depressive symptoms measured at middle age among men at high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD).\n## METHODS\n12,866 men without definite evidence of CHD at study entry but who had above average risk of CHD based on blood pressure, blood cholesterol levels, and/or cigarette smoking were recruited into the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT). Survivors at the end of the trial were followed-up for mortality for an additional 18 years. Men who had completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale near the end of the trial (n=11,216) were used in a prospective analysis of post-trial all-cause and cause-specific mortality during 18-year follow-up after CES-D assessment.\n## RESULTS\nGreater depressive symptoms measured at the end of the trial were associated with significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality and for cause-specific death, a higher risk of CVD, and, more specifically, stroke mortality (all P values <0.02) but not CHD mortality (P=0.48) in linear trend analyses. The significant associations were strongest for those reporting the greatest depression: hazard ratio (HR)=1.15 (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.28; P<0.01) for all-cause mortality for those in the highest depressive symptom quintile, HR=1.21 for CVD mortality (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.41; P<0.05), and HR=2.03 for stroke mortality (95% CI, 1.20 to 3.44; P<0.01) compared with those in the lowest quintile. These associations were adjusted for age, intervention group, race, educational attainment, smoking at baseline and visit 6, trial averaged systolic blood pressure, alcohol consumption, and fasting cholesterol, as well as the occurrence of nonfatal cardiovascular events during the trial.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nGreater depressive symptoms are associated with an increase in the risk of all-cause and, more specifically, CVD mortality in men.

There are several methodological issues regarding cerebrovascular disease, including defining severity and thresholds, importance of location and system of assessment.

Conceptually, apathy is defined as lack of motivation not attributable to diminished level of consciousness, cognitive impairment, or emotional distress. Operationally, the AES treats apathy as a psychological dimension defined by simultaneous deficits in the overt behavioral, cognitive, and emotional concomitants of goal-directed behavior. Three versions of the AES (clinician, informant, and self-rated) were evaluated for 123 subjects, ages 53-85, meeting research criteria for right or left hemisphere stroke, probable Alzheimer's disease, major depression, or well elderly control. Multiple forms of reliability (internal consistency, test-retest, and interrater) were satisfactory. Several types of validity evidence are presented for each version of the scale, including the following: ability of the AES to discriminate between groups according to mean levels of apathy, discriminability of apathy ratings from standard measures of depression and anxiety, convergent validity between the three versions of the scale, and predictive validity measures derived from observing subjects' play with novelty toys and videogames. Guidelines for the administration of the AES are presented, along with suggestions for potential applications of the scale to clinical and research questions."

In the case of depression associated with stroke, there is little information about the biochemical profile of these regions, as assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). In a group of first-ever stroke patients, we studied the association between post-stroke depression and (1)H-MRS measurements in unaffected frontal lobes. Twenty-six patients with a first ischemic stroke located outside the frontal lobes were included in the study. Single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) was performed to assess N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA)/Cr, glutamate+glutamine (Glx)/Cr, choline (Cho)/Cr and myo-inositol (mI)/Cr ratios. Patients were assessed within the first 10 days after stroke and again four months later. The diagnosis of depression was made on the basis of clinical observation, interview and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores. In a group of 26 patients, eight (31%) met criteria for depression at the first assessment, and nine (35%) met criteria for depression at follow-up. Patients with depression in the immediate post-stroke phase had significantly higher Glx/Cr ratios in the contralesional hemisphere than non-depressive patients. No biochemical differences were found between the groups at 4-month follow-up. These findings suggest that post-stroke depression is accompanied by changes in frontal lobe glutamate/glutamine levels, perhaps reflecting abnormalities in glutamatergic transmission in the immediate post-stroke period."

In regard to pathophysiology, modern brain imaging and postmortem assessments are elucidating neuropathologic changes in elderly depressives that challenge the notion that geriatric depression is simply a functional brain disorder. These data suggest (but do not yet establish) that many patients who experience depression onset at a late age may acquire affective disease on an arteriosclerotic basis. In contrast, elderly depressives who experience depression onset at an early age are more likely to have acquired depression due to genetic factors but may nevertheless develop degenerative neuropathologic changes over time. The presence of these neuropathologic changes appears to increase elderly patients' risk for developing the adverse central nervous system (CNS) effects of antidepressant treatments. They thereby add another level of complexity to the management of an age group in which pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes already contribute to the likelihood of adverse drug reactions. Fortunately, the last decade of antidepressant drug development has produced several new agents (including the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors and more recently, venlafaxine and nefazodone) with substantially reduced CNS and cardiovascular toxicity that facilitate effective treatment of geriatric depression."

            "abstract": "While emotional outcome is a critical factor influencing early evolution and late prognosis after stroke, few relevant studies have been performed on this subject. However, mood changes, modified judgment, and emotional reactions may also dramatically alter recruitment into clinical trials; for instance, up to one third of patients with acute stroke may have altered time perception, inappropriate self-evaluation of their condition, and attentional or memory dysfunction, with a subsequent increase in referral-to-hospital delays. In addition, the value of the \"informed\" consenting process may be questionable in the setting of urgent randomization into an acute stroke clinical trial. Data from ongoing studies suggest that behavior and emotional reactions in acute stroke patients may be classified into a few broad categories, with considerable overlap. Correlations between mood changes and the type, location, and severity of stroke may provide useful information for improving patient management, including the prediction of functional evolution and late prognosis. While depressive reactions have been widely studied in the recovery-rehabilitation phase after stroke, significant depression is uncommon shortly after stroke. On the other hand, related, though different, emotional behavioral changes may be more frequent; these have often been confused with depression and include catastrophic reaction, emotionalism, and athymhormia. Late depression is the most common mood alteration during the first year after stroke and has specific characteristics that differentiate it from classic endogenous and reactive depression, thus emphasizing the critical role of brain damage in the pathogenesis of poststroke depression. Early recognition and management of mood disorders after stroke are critical for the functional improvement of individual patients. However, little is known about specific indications for different antidepressant drugs in poststroke depression and related disorders. Ongoing research has identified a \"new\" emotional-behavioral disorder, poststroke fatigue, which is clearly distinct from depression in most instances. It is especially disabling and frustrating in that it typically involves patients with total or near-total neurological recovery, who should have been able to go back to their previous activities but who become severely disabled because of early and persisting exhaustion. Preliminary neuropsychological and MR and PET imaging studies suggest that disruption of subtle mechanisms underlying attention, in the absence of significant cognitive and mood alterations, may be responsible. Research projects are now being launched to better delineate poststroke fatigue and its management."

            "abstract": "One important challenge in neuropsychiatry is how to diagnose depression in patients with acute brain lesions, since there may be an overlap between symptoms of depression and signs associated with the neurologic disease. The best approach is to assess the presence of depressive symptoms using semi-structured or structured psychiatric interviews such as the Present State Exam, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, or the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry. The diagnosis of a depressive syndrome should be made using standardized diagnostic criteria for mood disorders due to neurological disease such as in the DSM-IV or the ICD-10. Depression rating scales, such as the Hamilton Depression Scale and the Center for Epidemiologic Scales for Depression may be used to rate the severity of depression and monitor the progression of antidepressant treatment. Most studies in acute and chronic neurologic disorders demonstrated the specificity of both autonomic and psychological symptoms for the syndrome of depression. The present review article examines important considerations before a diagnosis of depression in neurologic disease, discusses a variety of psychiatric instruments that are used to examine the presence and severity of depression in neurologic disease, examines relevant phenomenological issues, and proposes different diagnostic strategies."

Control group comprised 10 patients matched for demographic and clinical characteristics and been not assigned to cipramil. All patients were fully examined by clinical methods, including computer tomography. Besides, for patient's state evaluation, Hamilton rating scale for depression and Lindmark scale for focal neurologic deficit measuring have been administered. The initial scores on these scales were 22.8 +/- 4.5 and 381.4 +/- 33.4 in the basic group and--22.2 +/- 6.3 and 390.6 +/- 29.8 in the controls, respectively. While cipramil using, an improvement was observed rather quickly--after 2-3 weeks, being stable during the whole treatment course. After treatment finishing, depression scores on Hamilton scale decreased to 15.8 +/- 5.2 (p < 0.001) in the basic group and did not change in the control one. The neurological deficit expression has not been changed. Side effects were mildly expressed in 20% of the patients. In one-third of the patients, antidepressant effect diminished in 1.5 months after treatment finishing. A need for longer antidepressant treatment of post stroke patients is discussed."

Its prevalence peaks 3-6 months after stroke onset. In nearly a quarter of all PSD patients, depressive symptoms persist over at least 2 years.Several longitudinal studies have identified different factors which may increase the risk of PSD. Most probably, the severity of the neurological deficit, female gender, history of previous psychiatric disorders, and bad social living conditions increase the risk of PSD. It is uncertain whether lesion location or size modulate PSD risk. Increasing age is not associated with a higher PSD incidence. In contrast, it is obvious that PSD is associated with less favorable outcome and higher mortality. The degree of disability and quality of life are significantly reduced in PSD patients. In conclusion, PSD is presently a not predictable complication of ischemic stroke which is significantly associated with less favorable outcome.Early diagnosis and adequate therapy are still necessary in stroke rehabilitation."

Seventy patients (27 with TBI, 30 with CVA, and 13 with HBI) filled in a coping questionnaire (COPE) and were evaluated with respect to apathy and depression. A comparison sample of 71 students also filled in COPE. Patients coping strategies were similar to the comparison group, but patients tended to display less differentiated coping styles. A factor analysis indicated two dimensions of coping in the patient sample; approach oriented and avoidance oriented coping. Approach and avoidance coping sum scores, based on subscales from the two factors, were positively correlated in the patient sample, but not in the comparison group. Lack of active approach oriented coping was associated with apathy, whereas avoidant coping was associated with depression. Coping styles were not related to lesion location. Apathy was related to subcortical and right hemisphere lesions. In bivariate analyses, depression was unrelated to lesion location, but, in a MANCOVA, avoidant coping, apathy and lesion location (left hemisphere lesions) contributed to the variance in positive depressive symptoms. The consistent relationships between coping strategies and neuropsychiatric symptoms were interpreted as two dimensions of adaptational behaviour: an active vs. passive dimension and a depression--distress-avoidance dimension."

            "abstract": "Depression and apathy are often observed after stroke and are often confused with one another. In the present review, we argue that the current concept of 'post-stroke depression' (PSD) in fact consists of two core symptoms or syndromes: (i) affective (depressive) PSD; and (ii) apathetic PSD. We argue that these two core symptoms are each associated with a different underlying neuroanatomical mechanism, a pattern that influences functional recovery. Post-stroke disabilities can provoke several distinct emotional responses, some of which are associated with severe depression. We examined one of these emotional responses previously, namely 'insistence on recovery', which was believed to be a negative indicator of functional improvement in disabled stroke patients. However, an appropriate level of insistence on recovery may, in fact, be associated with reduced depression and apathy, resulting in enhanced recovery from stroke-related disabilities. Improvements in physical disabilities (trunk stability or activities of daily living, such as walking) also reduce depression and apathy. Therefore, the experience of PSD/apathy may be intertwined with various initial emotional responses and improvements in physical functioning. Effective treatment of PSD/apathy requires a multidisciplinary approach, such that neuroanatomical/neurobiological, emotional, and physical (rehabilitation) domains are all addressed."

When response is insufficient, a diagnosis of depression and any comorbidities should be confirmed, treatment adherence should be established, and antidepressant dosages should be optimized as tolerated. If response is still insufficient, then implementing second-line treatment strategies is warranted. Second-line strategies of switching to or combining/augmenting the initial agent with one of a variety of antidepressant medications and/or psychotherapies improves remission rates, although no single approach or agent has demonstrated clear superiority over any other. Second-line treatment selections should be driven by safety considerations, patients' symptom profiles, and patient preference.

Treatment groups received TFA at three different doses (160, 80, and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) or fluoxetine (Flu, 2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) daily for 24 days. Change in behavior, brain tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were measured.

Treatment with TFA (160, 80, and 40 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated mice escape-directed behavioral impairment induced by PSD, markedly reduced MDA levels, and increased the activity of SOD, GSH-Px close to normal levels. TFA administration also attenuated PSD-induced neuronal death/losses, upregulated expression of BDNF both at mRNA and protein levels, as well as CREB mRNA levels. TFA had a protective effect against PSD injury in mice. Cardioprotection involves the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and upregulation of BDNF-CREB levels in the hippocampus, which may also be important mechanism of its antidepressants.

Often elder people complain about somatic disorders and cognitive impairment, sometimes covering the psychopathologic symptoms and hampering diagnostic classification. Cerebrovascular disorders has been considered to be one major cause for depressive mood in the elderly. In a recent paper Alexopoulos et al.

The new concept is critically reviewed with regard of its clinical feasibility. In contrast to the ICD-10 guidelines the vascular depression concept requires no connection between the occurrence of psychopathology and of cerebrovascular disorder. Therefore it appears to be more feasible in clinical practice. However, a differentiation of vascular depression into two subtypes according to the CT/MRI findings seems to be more promising: type I (macroangiopathy) is similar to post-stroke-depression, while type II is characterized by microangiopathy and its clinical description resembles that for vascular depression of Alexopoulos et al. Up to now possible therapeutic consequences have not been investigated. Moreover, the concept of vascular depression basing only on two clinical studies needs further confirmation."

These findings support the hypothesis that age, presumably related to physiological response to brain injury, accounts for differences in the effect of major depression on cognitive function between stroke and TBI patients."

            "abstract": "The Numbers of elderly people are gradually increasing in our society, and mood disorders are progressively increasing among older people. Old age depression may also occur after life events: the death of the significant other, economical reasons, health problems (neurological and/or cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, nutritional deficiency) and can develop into a depressive state. Old age depression is often mistreated, or undertreated, and also underdiagnosed, and this for several reasons: older people reduce their social relations, depression very often presents as a comorbidity with organic diseases (that cover and mask depressive symptoms); finally,the patient may believe that a depressive state is a normal course of life in older people. Recovering from depression is really feasible both in young/adults and in old people, but in older people we can find a higher frequency of admission to hospital, or mortality or suicidality. The depressive symptoms in old age depression is similar to those in adults, however the following aspects require special care, in order to ensure a correct diagnosis despite the presence of comorbidities: - the mood: in contrast with the young and adult, old people often do not complain about their low mood; - the psychotic simptoms: hypocondriacal and psychotic, including hallucinatory symptoms are often present; - the anxiety symptoms: these are often present together with neuro-sensory symptoms; - the somatic symptoms: the comorbidity with organic diseases can mask and overlap the depressive state; - reduction of congnitive functioning: in these cases, which are quite frequent, it is essential to make a differential diagnosis from \"pseudodementia\" and \"dementia\". In conclusion, several factors contribute to the onset of depression in old age, so that we can assert that it is a really a multifactorial disease."

Ninety per cent of the followed patients were independent and 53% returned to work, although adjustments were necessary for 23% of them. The annual stroke recurrence rate during the first year was 3.6% dropping to 1.7% in subsequent years. Age over 35 years, male gender, the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and large-artery atherosclerosis in the carotid territory were predictors of negative long-term outcome after the initial stroke.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The long-term prognosis for the ischemic stroke in the young is better than in the elderly, but the risk of mortality in young adults with ischemic stroke is much higher than in the general population of the same age.

Participants who had a higher level of depression at T2 tended to have a higher level of functional disability, less social companionship and poorer informational support. Those who had been homemaker at pre-morbid state and those who exhibited a higher level of depressive symptoms at T1 showed a higher level of depression at T2.

Differences in symptom profile between PSD and depression with no or another medical cause were described, but no specific and unequivocal clinical picture has been established so far. Prevalence rates of PSD varied largely between studies. In community based studies using standardised diagnostic instruments for depression, relatively low prevalence rates were reported compared to inpatient or rehabilitation studies. PSD occurs most frequently in the first few months after stroke, while a new incidence peak may occur 2-3 years after stroke. Two systematic reviews on the relation between lesion location and depression did not support the claim that left hemisphere lesions are a risk factor for PSD. A new concept of vascular depression has been proposed, which relates depression in the elderly to acute or chronic damage to the cerebral vascular system. Future efforts should aim at increasing the uniformity of study designs, assessment tools should be further improved for use in cognitively impaired patients and appropriate control groups should be defined to study the characteristic features of PSD."

At present, pharmacological treatment consists of selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors and serotonine noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Tricyclic antidepressive therapy is also effective, but often unsuitable due to side effects. Post-stroke emotional symptoms may affect the patients' neurological outcome, and should be emphasized more in the stroke unit. Documentation is insufficient regarding the effects of medical intervention, and more knowledge is needed."

Depression frequently occurs after stroke and influences functional recovery, a crucial factor for the prognosis. The physiopathology of post-stroke depression is not entirely elucidated and might involve several mechanisms: direct consequences of brain lesions, especially in certain localizations, neuroendocrine mechanism or psychological reaction to a life event responsible for stress and handicap. Antidepressant drugs improve depressive symptoms and functional recovery. Therefore, search for depression should be systematic early at the stroke reeducation phase to instaure appropriate treatment."

This study was undertaken to identify the specific elements of social functioning that are related to depression and impaired recovery and to determine whether these elements are different between acute and chronic periods following stroke. There were 50 patients with acute stroke who were assessed in the hospital and at short-term (3- or 6-month) and long-term (12- or 24-month) follow-up. An impaired relationship with the patient's \"closest other\" prior to the stroke and limited social activities were both associated with depression immediately after the stroke as well as with depression at long-term follow-up. An impaired relationship with the closest other prior to the stroke was also associated with impaired recovery in activities of daily living and cognitive recovery at long-term follow-up. Fears of economic stability and limited social activity were associated with depression at short-term follow-up whereas loss of job or job satisfaction was associated with depression at long-term follow-up. These findings suggest that during the first few weeks following stroke, social supports and contact are essential needs for patients, whereas during the chronic period, other factors such as financial security, adequacy of living arrangements, and loss of job satisfaction also become important. Future research should examine the effect of enhanced social support on poststroke depression and physical and cognitive recovery."

One hundred consecutively hospitalized patients were randomized to receive 60 mg/day of mianserin (n = 51) or placebo for 1 year in a double-blind trial with a 6-month follow-up after the therapy. Symptoms of insomnia were assessed with the three insomnia-related items of the Hamilton Depression Scale; patients were defined as insomniacs if any of these items was positive. Complaints of insomnia occurred in 68% of patients on admission, and in 49% at 18 months, and they were as frequent in all subgroups of patients. From 2 months, symptoms of insomnia were associated independently with depression. Living alone before stroke (at 0 and 2 months) and age (at 12 months) were other independent predictors of insomnia. The rate of recovery as evaluated by the insomnia score was more rapid in patients on mianserin than in those on placebo. At 2 months, the scores were significantly different favoring mianserin treatment (1.3 vs. 0.8, p = 0.02). We conclude that insomnia is a common complaint after ischemic stroke.

Prevalence of moderate to severe depression and anxiety in the sample were high (22.8 and 21.1%, respectively), with co-morbidity in 12.3% of cases. In regression analysis, 74.6% of variance in depression was explained, with significant relationships between increased depression and younger age, reduced cognitive speed, poorer verbal memory, left hemisphere lesion, and increased impact of interference (Stroop ratio). Left hemisphere of lesion also contributed to prediction of anxiety, as did cognitive speed, explaining 50.7% of the variance. The findings suggest that individuals with left hemisphere lesions may be particularly at risk of developing depression and anxiety after stroke, with younger individuals also at heightened risk of depression. While age and hemisphere of lesion contributed, cognitive performance explained the greatest proportion of variance in both depression and anxiety (51.3 and 38.5%, respectively).

After 1 year survivors (n=253) were examined with respect to residual impairment, disability, cognition and depression.

Twenty-eight patients (11%) had stroke-associated pain and 135 (53%) had stroke-associated fatigue. Pain was associated with depression and different manifestations of stroke severity, especially degree of paresis at baseline. Fatigue was more associated with physical disability. In univariate analysis, fatigue was also associated with sleep disturbances. In conclusion, it is important to be aware of the occurrence of pain and fatigue after stroke, because these symptoms are common, they impair quality of life and they are potentially treatable.

PSD is the most frequent psychic complication among stroke survivors. Depression has a significant impact on post-stroke recovery and mortality. The diagnosis of PSD is based on the structured mental state examination and DSM-IV criteria as well as on the scores of the clinical symptoms scale (the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) and self-rated inventories. PSD is multifactorial in origin and develops under the influence of biopsychosocial factors. The anatomical correlates of PSD change over time. In acute stage and 3-6 months after stroke, depression is associated with left-hemisphere lesion severity and proximity of the lesion to the frontal pole and related to the dysfunction of (cortico-) striato-pallido-thalamic-cortical projections. In post-stroke period (1-2 years) depression is significantly associated with right-hemisphere lesion severity and proximity of the lesion to the occipital pole. The most relevant psychosocial risk factors for PSD are described as follows: past history of depression and other mental disorders, dysphasia, functional impairment, living alone and post-stroke social isolation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (citalopram and fluoxetine) may be effective in the treatment of PSD."

When those who showed evidence of anxiety disorder before stroke were subtracted, the latter prevalence was 9% in men and 20% in women.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      One-third of the men and half of the women with post-stroke anxiety disorders showed evidence of either depression or an anxiety disorder at the time of the stroke. At 12 month follow-up of 49 patients with agoraphobia by a non-hierarchic approach, 51% had recovered, and equal proportions of the remainder had died or still had agoraphobia. The only major difference in outcome between those with anxiety disorder alone and those with comorbid depression was the greater mortality in the latter."

Second, neuroradiological investigations in patients with a major depressive disorder can be performed. The authors review the literature on both subjects. Until now, unequivocal conclusions concerning vascular lesions on CT or MRI and depressive features in the elderly cannot be drawn from research data available. Moreover, the so-called Post-stroke depression is still not fully understood. Some difficulties encountered in this area of research are also addressed. The authors suggest a neurological cause for the late onset types of major depressive illness and also suggest that these depressions are phenomenologically different from the early onset subtypes of depressive illness. The post stroke depression also seems to differ phenomenologically from major depression according to DSM-criteria."

Few studies have prospectively investigated cardiovascular events related to depression in older women. We describe prevalence, cardiovascular correlates, and relationship to subsequent cardiovascular events of depressive symptoms among generally healthy postmenopausal women.\n## METHODS\nThe Women's Health Initiative Observational Study followed up 93 676 women for an average of 4.1 years. Depression was measured at baseline with a short form of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events were estimated from Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for multiple demographic, clinical, and risk factor covariates.\n## RESULTS\nCurrent depressive symptoms above the screening cutoff point were reported by 15.8% of women. Depression was significantly related to CVD risk and comorbidity (odds ratios ranging from 1.12 for hypertension to 1.60 for history of stroke or angina). Among women with no history of CVD, depression was an independent predictor of CVD death (relative risk, 1.50) and all-cause mortality (relative risk, 1.32) after adjustment for age, race, education, income, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, high cholesterol level requiring medication, body mass index, and physical activity. Taking antidepressant medications did not alter the depression-associated risks associated.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA large proportion of older women report levels of depressive symptoms that are significantly related to increased risk of CVD death and all-cause mortality, even after controlling for established CVD risk factors. Whether early recognition and treatment of subclinical depression will lower CVD risk remains to be determined in clinical trials.\n"

            "abstract": "Retrospective analysis of the phenomenology and the diagnostic process of 112 consecutive psychogeriatric admissions revealed the majority (61%) were suffering from affective illness. In 53 percent, the reason for admission was depression and 8 percent were in the manic phase of a bipolar disorder. Dementia was diagnosed in 32 percent, with a third of these patients having an associated depression. The remaining 7 percent had a schizophrenic or paranoid disorder. Ninety-two patients (82%) were found to have at least one coexisting medical and/or neurological disorder(s) requiring early intervention. Associated acute organic brain syndromes were common (18%) and often difficult to diagnose. The AOBS was at times the only sign of an underlying active medical condition. The diagnosis of this condition often required serial observations for fluctuations in mental status accompanied by appropriate laboratory investigations. These findings underscore the complexity of the diagnostic process in psychogeriatric patients suffering from concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders. High index of awareness is recommended for the need to search for coexisting delirium, which may be masked at times by the major psychiatric disorder."

Ninety-four stroke inpatients were examined two months post-stroke for clinical depression and pre-stroke personality characteristics of neuroticism and introversion. Fifteen months later, the vital status of 84 of these patients was able to be determined. Seven (8%) of the 84 patients died. Mortality rate increased from non-depressed to minor depressed and to major depressed patients (1/48 [2%], 2/21 [10%] and 3/13 [23%], respectively) (chi 2[trend] = 6.6, df = 1, p = 0.01). Patients who died had higher depression symptom scores (mean +/- SD) than survivors (17.7 +/- 6.0 versus 9.9 +/- 7.1) (p = 0.006). Non-survivors were more introverted (i.e. had lower extroversion scores) than survivors (1.7 +/- 1.4 versus 4.2 +2- 2.1) (p = 0.004).

            "abstract": "Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease are associated with a high incidence of depressive disorder. Despite this high level of co-morbidity, depressive disorders appear to go largely unrecognised and remain untreated. This may have serious consequences, as concomitant depression worsens the prognosis in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, increases medical costs, and delays return to work. Treatment with traditional tricyclic antidepressants is difficult in these patients because of the known cardiac effects. The favourable side-effect profiles of the 5-HT reuptake inhibitors suggest that they may offer therapeutic advantages, as they have little or no effect on cardiac conduction, do not cause orthostatic hypotension, and lack serious sequelae in overdose. The pharmacological profiles and the reduced potential of these newer antidepressant drugs to cause drug interaction show important differences that may be of clinical relevance in this patient population."

The depression scores in \" worrying about nothing \" were significantly lower than the depression scores in \" worrying about disease \" (t = -4.03, p =.03). (3) There was no significant correlation between the depression score and the Mini-Mental State Examination score, or the Barthel Index score. (4) Social support and depression were negatively correlated (r = -.306, p =.001). (5) Multiple regression analysis revealed that \" worrying about disease, \" \" worrying about family, \" and informational support from family, relatives and friends accounted for 22.1% of the variance in depression. The implications for clinical practice and further studies are suggested."

Aphasia is common consequence of left hemispheric lesion and most common neuropsychological consequence of stroke, with prevalence of one third of all stroke patients in acute phase although exist reports on greater frequency. Unilateral neglect is a disorder that mostly effects the patient after the lesion of the right hemisphere, mostly caused by a cerebrovascular insult (infarct or haemorrhage affecting a large area - up to two thirds of the right hemisphere), and in general the left-side neglect is the most widespread neuropsychological deficit after the lesion of the right cerebral hemisphere. Reports on the incidence of visual neglect vary and they range from 13 to 85%. Anosognosia is on the second place as neuropsychological syndrome of stroke in right hemisphere, characterized by the denial of the motor, visual or cognitive deficit. This syndrome, defined as denial of hemiparesis or hemianopsia, is a common disorder verified in 17-28% of all patents with acute brain stoke. There are different reports on frequency of delirium in acute stroke, from 24 to 48%, and it is more frequent in hemorrhagic then ischemic stoke. Post stroke depression (PSD) is one of the more frequent consequences on the stroke, and the prevalence of PSD has ranged from 5 to 63% of patients in several cross-sectional studies, peaking three to six months after a stroke."

We aim to evaluate sociodemographic and clinical predictors of cognitive level and depression in subjects with different lesion laterality. We assessed 153 right (n = 87) and left (n = 66) unilateral first-ever stroke patients within the first year of illness with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-Patient Edition, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the State Trait Anger Expression Inventory, the Barthel Index, and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Sociodemographic variables were also measured. Sixty-two (41 %) patients suffered from Major Depression (MDD), and 26 (17 %) suffered from Minor Depression (MIND). An univariate analysis of variance showed that MMSE scores were different throughout the groups of left and right stroke patients with MDD, MIND and without depression. Left stroke patients with MDD were more cognitively impaired than all the other groups. This result was valid after controlling for the effect of lesion location on cognitive level difference between the groups. A series of stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated that depression severity was a predictor of cognitive level and vice-versa in left hemispheric stroke patients only. Moreover, educational level in right hemispheric stroke patients and state-anger and number of regions affected in left hemispheric stroke patients were other predictors of cognitive level. The study confirms the hypothesis that predictors of cognitive level and depression severity are different in subjects with different laterality of lesion and that MDD is associated with cognitive impairment in left stroke patients."

Difficulties recalling specific autobiographical memories (overgeneral memory) have been identified as important psychological variables in depression and predictors of outcome (Williams and Scott 1988; Brittlebank et al., 1993). Intrusive autobiographical memories have also been found to be associated with depression and overgeneral memory in depressed women (Kuyken and Brewin, 1995) and depressed cancer patients (Brewin et al., 1998a).

In combined data (stroke and non-stroke) autobiographical memories (intrusive images of their illness, intrusive memories of other events and overgeneral memory recall variables) were significant predictors of depression in this cohort. This suggests that psychological intervention of memory processes may be a worthwhile target in psychological intervention for depression in these cohorts.

Thirty-six patients with geriatric depression were classified according to the age at onset into 16 who developed depression at the age of <50 years (early-onset group) and 20 who developed depression at the age of > or =50 years (late-onset group). The incidence of SCI assessed by subcortical hyperintensity on MRI images, office blood pressure (BP), nocturnal systolic BP fall pattern examined by 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring, and the severity of carotid atherosclerosis examined by B-mode ultrasonography were compared between the two groups. Furthermore, the association between the presence or absence of SCI and the nocturnal systolic BP fall pattern or the severity of carotid atherosclerosis was evaluated. The SCI complication rate was higher in the late-onset group (55.0%) than in the early-onset group (18.7%). The office BP and mean 24-hour BP did not differ significantly between the two groups. Abnormal nocturnal systolic BP fall patterns were observed in 85.0% (nondipper type showing a fall of <10% in 60.0%, extreme-dipper type showing a fall of > or =20% in 25.0%) in the late-onset group, which was significantly higher than the incidence in the early-onset group (18.7%). No significant difference was observed in any parameter of carotid atherosclerosis between the two groups.

Among the many studies presented in the review is one that indicates major depression following right hemisphere lesions is associated with a positive family history of psychiatric disorder and lesions involving the parietal cortex. The co-occurrence of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder is associated with cortical lesions, while depression alone is associated with subcortical lesions.

The prevalences of PSD and major depression in the subacute phase evaluated by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, were 20.0 and 5.0%, respectively. These values were lower than those reported in Caucasian studies. The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) did not underestimate the presence of PSD and was thus considered valuable for the initial screening of PSD.

            "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated that poststroke depression is associated with cognitive impairment, but have failed to show improvement in cognitive function when mood improves. A consecutive series of patients with (n=41) or without (n=135) major depression were evaluated for cognitive functioning during acute hospitalization and either 3 or 6 months later. Patients with poststroke major depression whose mood improved at follow-up had significantly greater recovery in cognitive functioning than patients whose mood did not improve. Furthermore, patients whose cognitive functioning improved at follow-up had significantly greater improvement in mood than comparable patients whose cognitive function did not improve, suggesting that poststroke major depression leads to cognitive impairment and not vice versa. The failure of previous treatment studies to show cognitive improvement in poststroke patients with depression was probably due to the inclusion of patients with minor depression (not associated with cognitive impairment) or the failure of patients with major depression to respond to treatment."

            "abstract": "Neuropsychological symptoms are probably among the most commonly ignored complications in stroke patients. Depression is a common yet often unrecognized neuropsychological consequence of stroke, having biological, psycho-behavioral, and social dimensions. The reported prevalence of depression following a stroke varies from 20% to 50% within the first year, with an apparent peak within the first 6 months of onset event. The disparity of reported prevalence rates significantly depends on study methodology, diagnostic assessment tools, and time elapsed after stroke onset. The etiology of depression after a stroke is complex; it is likely determined by multiple factors, including lesion location, social handicap, and family support. Depression impedes rehabilitation progress following stroke and is associated with impaired functional outcome, cognitive decline, and increased mortality. Similarly, depression has been linked to increased risk of stroke occurrence. Despite high prevalence and serious sequels, poststroke depression (PSD) remains undetected and untreated. Early diagnosis and successful intervention may improve clinical outcome and should be considered a key for better stroke care. In this article, we review the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and consequences of PSD and summarize current recommendations for therapeutic intervention."

            "abstract": "We present one case of Sjögren's syndrome (SS) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with predominant psychiatric manifestations, treated with success by cyclophosphamide. From this case, we review the psychiatric aspects of these two autoimmune diseases as described in the literature and we present the etiopathogenic hypothesis and treatment of the psychiatric disorders. Case report--In August 1996, a 38 year old man was admitted in our psychiatric department for agitation. Primary SS had been diagnosed in July 1996. He had previously attempted to suicide but was never hospitalized in a psychiatric department. During the hospitalization in our department, the patient had auditive hallucinations and felt persecuted. He received loxapine 400 mg/day and was remitted in a few days. He was discharged to a convalescent home with the diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder. In October 1996, he was readmitted to our department for agitation. He had shown agitated behavior and aggression in the convalescent home. There were no hallucinations and no affective disorders. He became calm rapidly and was discharged home a few days later. In November 1996, he was found in a coma by a neighbor. He was admitted to an intensive care unit. The lumbar punction revealed blood cells. Cerebral computer tomography showed subarachnoid hemorrhage. The diagnosis was meningeal hemorrhage due to vasculitis. After regaining consciousness, the patient complained of reduced visual acuity. This was believed to be due to retrobulbar neuritis and the patient's vision improved slightly with corticosteroids. The third hospitalization in our department occurred in February 1997 for depression. The patient had shut himself away for days in his apartment. He had suicidal ideas. His mood improved progressively under fluoxetine 40 mg/day. He was discharged to a convalescent home with the diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The fourth and last admission in our department occurred in June 1997. There were disturbances of memory and orientation. He felt sad and guilty about accusation of sexual abuse on his daughter. He presented typical histrionic symptoms: he had catatonic attitudes only in public areas such as the corridors. Cerebral computer tomography and electroencephalogram were normal. There was no biological abnormality. Signs of confusion rapidly disappeared. He felt better after reintroduction of fluoxetine 40 mg/day. Diagnosis was non-specified depressive disorder, but this episode could be retrospectively seen as delirium. After being hospitalized on these four occasions in one year in our psychiatric department, the diagnosis of his systemic disease was revised by rheumatologists. The patient was diagnosed as suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus associated with secondary Sjögren's syndrome. From September 1997, he received cyclophosphamide 2 g intraveinously per month during 6 months. His vision improved dramatically. His ocular dryness became milder. His mood is now stable. He has not suffered from hallucinations or delusion since. Psychiatric disorders in SLE--During the course of SLE, the occurrence of psychiatric manifestations varies widely from 5 to 83%. They include psychotic disorders, major depressive disorders, subtle cognitive disorders and personality disorders of histrionic type. Etiopathogenic hypothesis are: direct activity of the disease on the central nervous system by autoantibodies (antiphospholipide and antiribosome P autoantibodies) (18, 19) or cytokines (interleukin 2, interleukin 6, alpha interferon) (38, 59), side-effects of glucocorticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine (16) or anxious reaction to a chronic and potentially lethal illness (43, 54). Nevertheless, immunologic and cerebral imagery research suggests that psychiatric disorders are related to vasculitis and non-inflammatory vasculopathy of the small cerebral blood vessels. The management of the patients should include treatment of the disease itself and specific psychotropic treatment. Glucocorticosteroids and especially intravenous infusions of immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclophosphamide, are effective. Psychotropic drugs must be used, making sure to avoid SLE-inducing drugs, like chlorpromazine, carbamazepine and lithium carbonate (19, 20, 45). In addition, psychologic care is essential. Psychiatric disorders in SS--During the course of the primary SS, the occurrence of psychiatric disorders is large as well: from 20 to 70% (47, 61, 62). They are mainly major depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, cognitive disorders and dementia. Brief psychotic disorders and delirium are rare. Etiopathogenic hypotheses are similar as those in SLE, with some differences: antiphospholipide and antiribosome P autoantibodies are not usually found in SS and anti-Ro (SSA) autoantibodies in serum are associated with psychiatric disorders (3-11, 61). According to Drosos et al. (29, 30), psychiatric disorders are explained by psychological distress. This slowly progressive fluctuating disease creates constant discomfort from dysphagia, dyspareunia and functional disability. Some of these manifestations can be treated by corticosteroids and psychotropic drugs. Drugs with anticholinergic side-effects, like phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants and hydroxyzine which can enhance the oral dryness have to be avoided. Social and psychological support is important too.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The diversity of psychiatric morbidity in SLE and SS may be due to differences in patient selection and a lack of uniform clinical criteria. Studies which use standardized diagnostic criteria and control groups don't allow one to come to a conclusion about the relative prevalence of the psychiatric disorders in these autoimmune diseases. This will probably be resolved thanks to the recently published \"American College of Rheumatology nomenclature and case definitions for neuropsychiatric lupus syndromes\" (1). Finally, we can ask ourselves if there is a significant number of undiagnosed SLE and SS in psychiatric departments. Two studies report systematic search for SLE in psychiatric patients. In 1992, Hopkinson et al. (39) searched for several autoantibodies in serum samples of nearly 300 hospitalized psychiatric patients. In 1993, Van Dam et al. (65) did the same with more than 2,000 patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Hopkinson et al. found 1% undiagnosed SLE, which is much higher than in general population, and recommended to search SLE in every patient with a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate in psychiatric services. Results of the Van Dam et al. study suggest on the contrary, that SLE is not a common cause of admission to psychiatric hospitals. There is no study which report systematic search of Sjögren's syndrome in a psychiatric department. This is probably because most of patients receive or have recently received psychotropics with anticholinergic side-effects which is an exclusion criteria of SS.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Psychiatrists should keep in mind that SLE and primary SS are potential causes of psychiatric manifestations when examining patients with multiple unexplained somatic complaints and psychiatric symptoms. They should then search for autoantibodies in the serum after careful physical examination. Diagnosis of SLE or SS could lead to a better adapted prescription of corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive drugs and specific psychotropic drugs, making sure to avoid lupus-inducing drugs in SLE and drugs with anticholinergic effects in SS. The existence of psychiatric manifestations in SLE and SS constitutes an indisputable clinical reality that each practitioner must be able to recognize and treat."

Patients included adults with a new episode of depression that had been diagnosed during the period October 2006 through July 2007 (n = 1513). Prescription of antidepressant medication and doses of antidepressant medication were compared for patients with and without 6 comorbid conditions: diabetes, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      20.7% of patients had at least one medical comorbidity whereas 5.8% had multiple comorbidities.

Although this effort has generated considerable empirical support for the validity of the subtype, fundamental questions remain including how the illness is defined, whether cerebrovascular disease and executive dysfunction (ED) define two separate entities or one underlying subtype, and whether ED is responsible for poor response to antidepressant treatment. In this guest editorial, we explore these and other issues (i.e., the role of personality and social support, psychosocial treatments targeting cognitive abilities frequently impaired in LLD) using a number of important papers that are either directly or indirectly related to the vascular depression hypothesis. In so doing we highlight a range of critical problems facing the vascular depression hypothesis and the effort to establish the illness as a unique diagnostic entity in late-life."

Although standard and non-standard major depressions had some clinical correlates such as increased frequency of female gender and prior psychiatric history, standard major depression patients had a significantly higher frequency of left hemisphere lesions than the non-standard major depression patients. These results support the validity of 'observed' depression as a criteria for major depression but also suggest the possibility that failure to report depressed mood may identify a condition with a different etiology than depression that is recognized and acknowledged.

Two geropsychiatrists independently evaluated 33 patients for symptoms of depression and/or dementia and then assigned each patient to one of the three groups. Subjects in the demented/not depressed group had a significantly larger proportion of abnormal DSTs (P less than .01), and the mean postdexamethasone, 4 PM blood cortisol level of the demented/not depressed group was significantly greater than the means of the other two groups (P less than .005). In this sample, the DST was more likely to identify dementia than depression. Until further investigations clarify the parameters of DST use in the elderly, the diagnosis of depression and dementia should continue to be determined by sensitive interpretation of clinical findings, history, and other diagnostic tests."

They were able to identify patients who were becoming depressed and tried to help them to the best of their abilities. They felt constrained, however; mainly by lack of time, limited skills and lack of appropriate training. They themselves wanted to be able to meet the needs of depressed patients and thought that this could be achieved through better staff education and access to other health professionals experienced in providing psychological care. It is recommended that nurses have access to expert personnel both as a source of referral for patients and as a resource for support and guidance to staff.

The Italian multicenter observational study Destro was designed to help clarify in a large sample the frequency and clinical impact of PSD. A total of 53 centers consecutively admitted 1064 patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, assessing them periodically in the first 9 months after the event. Patients with depression were followed for two years. Depression was diagnosed on clinical examination, verbal (Beck Depression Inventory) and non-verbal rating systems (Visual Analog Mood Scale), identifying the nosographic condition attributable to the mental state. The patient's clinical history, residual independence, and post-ictus quality of life were also taken into account. PSD was detected in 383 patients (36 %), most of whom had minor depression (80.17 %), with dysthymia, rather than major depression and adaptation disorder. About 80% developed depression within three months of the stroke. Cases with later onset tended to have less severe symptoms. Risk factors were a history of depression, severe disability, previous stroke and female sex, but not the type and site of the vascular lesion. PSD was not correlated with any increase in mortality or cerebrovascular recurrences, but these patients had lower autonomy and quality of life ratings. In conclusion, patients should be close observed in the first few weeks after a stroke in order to check for depression,which is more likely in those with clear risk factors and may spoil their quality of life."

Data were drawn from the Midlife Development in the United States Study (MIDUS) (N = 3032), a nationally representative sample of adults age 25 to 74. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between stroke (past 12-month prevalence), depression (past 12-month prevalence), and functional health outcomes (past 12 months) and to determine whether there is an interaction between depression and stroke in predicting impairment in functioning. Almost one third (29.2%) of adults with stroke in the past year also had depression in the past year (odds ratio 3.5, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 8.9). The co-occurrence of stroke and depression was associated with significantly greater limitations in walking and climbing stairs and poorer general physical functioning than that associated with either without the other. There was evidence of interaction between depression and stroke in predicting limitations, specifically with a statistically significant effect in walking short distances (P = .045). These findings are consistent with previous clinical data and extend those data by suggesting that the co-occurrence of depression and stroke is associated with even poorer functional health outcomes, compared with each alone, and that there may be synergism between the two disorders related to this effect."

Four qualitative studies on how patients experience stroke were identified. The findings of these studies show that the stroke patient often has clear goals for himself in relation to functional abilities, against which he measures all success and forward progress in his rehabilitation. Even though the stroke patient accepts a lower level of functional ability, he is not willing to accept the rehabilitation professionals' prediction of his ultimate functional level if it is lower than his own goal. Furthermore, stroke patients see recovery as a return to the existence they had lived before the stroke, which is different from the health care providers' view. To the health care provider, recovery is measured in terms of isolated and discrete return of movement, whereas in the eyes of the patients, recovery is a return to previously valued activities. Further, studies on psychosocial function after stroke were reviewed. Recent studies show that the psychological impact of the stroke experience is immense and that stroke patients experience stress on a variety of levels. Also, depression exists in a large portion of the stroke population. The impact of stroke also influences the patient's social existence, as studies have shown that stroke patients do manifest diminished social function. However, the reviewed studies are not without limitations. Further studies, with a qualitative design, are needed to throw light on the patient's experience of being ill with stroke, and the process of his recovery."

            "abstract": "Depression is common after stroke. While several reports have been published on the use of antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclics for the treatment of post-stroke depression (PSD), no previous study has examined the use of a selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) for this condition. The present study investigated the efficacy and safety of milnacipran, a SNRI, for the treatment of PSD. A 6-week open study was conducted in 12 patients (two males and 10 females) aged 53-88 years. All patients were diagnosed with major or minor depressive disorder according to DSM-IV, where onset was subsequent to a cerebral infarction or haemorrhage (stroke). Severity of depression was assessed using the 21-item Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D). The maximum total daily dose of milnacipran was in the range of 30-75 mg b.i.d. Three patients experienced side-effects, but none of the side-effects were serious. Two patients dropped out of the study. At the end of the study, 58.3% (7/12) of the total patient population and 70% (7/10) of the patients completing the study were in remission (a final HAM-D score of less than 7 and no longer meeting criteria for major or minor depression). These results suggest that milnacipran may be an effective treatment for PSD."

A factor analysis was performed on the responses of all 980 subjects. The relationships between subscale scores on the identified factors and causes of deaths occurring over 7.5 years in 817 respondents with no physical disability at baseline were assessed using a proportional hazards model adjusted for age, gender, chronic conditions under treatment, regular physical activity, and availability of close or casual neighbors.\n## RESULTS\nThe factor analysis identified three clusters of psychiatric symptoms: depression, apathy/anergia, and anxiety. In the proportional hazards model, which included three GHQ subscales depicting these factors simultaneously, the depression subscale was associated with increased mortality from cerebrovascular disease (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio per unit increase in the standard score on the depression subscale=2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.17-3.55), and the apathy/anergia subscale was associated with increased mortality from noncancer and noncardiovascular causes (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio per unit increase in the standard score on the apathy/anergia subscale=1.71, 95% CI=1.25-2.34). The anxiety subscale was not associated with any cause of death.\n## CONCLUSION\nDepressive symptoms and symptoms indicating apathy/anergia have differential influences on subsequent causes of death in older persons living in the community. Identification of specific psychiatric symptom clusters may contribute to the prevention of deaths from specific causes in older populations.\n"

This study examined the effect of remission of poststroke depression on recovery in ADL in a double-blind randomized treatment study.

Functional physical (i.e., ADL) impairment was assessed using the Johns Hopkins Functioning Inventory (JHFI). Patients whose depressive disorder remitted at follow-up had significantly greater recovery in ADL functions compared with patients whose depression did not remit. There were no differences in demographic variables, lesion characteristics, and neurological symptoms between the two groups, which would explain the significantly greater improvement among the remitted patients. Because both major and minor depression patients who remitted showed greater improvement in ADL than nonremitted patients some of whom were treated with active and some with placebo medication, nonpharmacotherapeutic mechanisms related to recovery from depression appear to mediate this enhanced recovery."

Blood flow velocities were measured by transcranial doppler ultrasound.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A group of acutely depressed patients presented a significantly reduced CVR compared to controls. On follow-up 21months later after treatment and remission, CVR in the patient group had significantly improved, whereas CVR in the control group remained unchanged. Confounding factors had no significant influence.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      CVR is impaired during major depression. Since CVR seems to improve after treatment of depression, the contribution to an increased stroke risk among depressive patients may be true for a subgroup only and needs to be further investigated."

            "abstract": "Depression is a common but often unrecognized complication after cerebrovascular stroke. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) have been found to be effective in poststroke depression, but side effects such as orthostatic hypotension, arrhythmia limit their wider use. In this pilot study the effects of treatment with the specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (20 mg) in 10 severely depressed patients (HAM-D score between 27 and 35) after cerebrovascular stroke were investigated. Four patients dropped out of the study prematurely because of worsening of their condition (n = 4) and one patient discontinued the study because of transfer to a nursing home. After 3 weeks of fluoxetine treatment there was a significant amelioration in all the measured scores (HAM-D, Beck, CGI and Barthel: P < 0.05). At the end of the study one patient with recurrent cerebrovascular lesions still had an HAM-D score of 25, but the other four patients had HAM-D scores between 6 and 11. The physical rehabilitation scores measured with the Barthel Index showed negative correlations with the HAM-D, Beck and CGI scores for most items; this has to be interpreted with caution considering the number of patients involved in this investigation. The authors suggest that future double blind trials are warranted to test the efficacy of fluoxetin therapy for poststroke depression. Methodological problems in connection with pharmacological trials in these severely ill patients are discussed."

            "abstract": "The psychopathology of stroke encompasses several psychiatric and behavioral disorders that have high prevalence in the geriatric population, reduce the patient autonomy and increase the caregiver's burden. These disorders are usually associated with other cognitive and neurological deficits, and are labelled as neuropsychiatric when the whole clinical picture is consistent with the specific dysfunction of a neural system or brain region. Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes. The clinical profile of the subcortical vascular dementia also points to specific brain dysfunction (frontal-subcortical pathways) that manifests with behavioral (depression, emotionalism, irritability) and cognitive symptoms (psychomotor retardation, attention, executive and memory deficits). However, post-stroke depression and anxiety, which have a more variable clinical presentation and might be assimilated, for several aspects, to post-traumatic or adaptive disorders, are disorders less characterized in their neural correlates."

One hundred and twenty-three stroke patients consecutively admitted to a stroke clinic and their 123 family caregivers were recruited. The caregivers' HRQOLs were assessed with the Short Form 36 (SF-36). Two subscores of the SF-36, the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary Scores served as the dependent variables. Independent variables comprised patients and caregivers' demographic data and physical and psychological conditions in relation to caregivers' HRQOL. The severity of coexisting illnesses of both the patients and their caregivers was assessed using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was administered to rate both the patients and their caregivers' depressive symptoms. The extent of the patients' functional disability was assessed using the Barthel Index and the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Global cognition of the patients was measured using the Mini Mental State Examination. The level of social support and recent life events of the caregivers were rated using Lubben Social Network Scale and the Modified Life Event Scale, respectively. The multiple linear regression revealed caregivers' Cumulative Illness Rating Scale and GDS score were associated with Physical Component Summary Score of SF-36. The patients and caregivers' GDS score were associated with Mental Component Summary Score of SF-36. Severity of depressive symptoms in Chinese stroke patients and their caregivers is an important factor associated with the caregivers' HRQOL. Further studies evaluating interventions on caregivers' HRQOL should include the assessment and management of mood disorders."

Up to 3.6 million of these people are considered housebound and in need of home-based care. Although homebound status is not defined specifically, with a broad range of disability levels, it is evident that people who are homebound suffer from a multitude of medical and psychiatric illnesses. This review examines the current literature to identify the specific physical and psychiatric factors most responsible for older adults becoming and remaining housebound. Homebound older adults suffer from metabolic, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and musculoskeletal diseases, as well as from cognitive impairment, dementia, and depression, at higher rates than the general elderly population. The information in this review will explain the specific types of care the homebound population needs and discuss the care that could help ease their suffering and delay their entry into a nursing home or hospital."

The subjects studied were 56 patients 50 years of age or older with a depressive state who underwent MRI and who were hospitalized and treated at the Department of Psychiatry or the Department of Neurology of Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital. We made a diagnosis of depression in patients who fulfilled the criteria of DSM-III-R for major depression. Patients in whom apoplectic attacks had occurred, or who had local neurologic symptoms or a history of evident cerebrovascular disorders, were not included in the study. Silent cerebral infarction was observed with pre-senile onset in 60.3% of patients with a pre-senile depressive state, and the complication rate was significantly higher than for cases with juvenile onset (20%). For patients with a senile depressive state, the complication of silent cerebral infarction was found in 53.6% of cases of pre-senile onset and in 100% of cases of senile onset. These rates were remarkably higher than the age-related complication rate of silent cerebral infarction in normal persons reported hitherto, we therefore suspect that nearly half of patients with depressive state of pre-senile onset and most of patients with that of senile onset might have an organic-depressive state complicated by silent cerebral infarction. Both perforating-type infarcts and cortical-type infarcts were found, suggesting that infarct-related foci of depressive states were polyphyletic. When we divided the depressive states complicated by cerebral infarction into 2 subtypes, those complicated by a perforating-type infarct and those by a cortical-type infarct, and compared the 2 types, we found possible differences in clinical symptoms and course between the subtypes. These differences seem worthy of further study. Among cortical-type lesions, parietal lesions were predominant, followed by frontal and then temporal lesions in incidence. There were significantly more left frontal lesions than right frontal lesions. Infarcts of both the parietal lobe and left frontal lobe may be related to the depressive state. Compared with cases not complicated by cerebral infarction, those with perforating- and mixed-type cerebral infarction were complicated with PVH significantly more frequently, similarity in risk factors and pathology between perforating-type cerebral infarction and PVH was suggested by these results."

            "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies of major depression have identified neurophysiological abnormalities in multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the amygdala, and related parts of the striatum and thalamus. Some of these abnormalities are mood state-dependent, and appear in regions where cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases during other normal and pathological emotional states. These neurophysiological differences between depressives and non-depressed controls may thus locate areas where physiological activity changes to mediate or respond to the emotional, behavioral and cognitive manifestations of major depressive episodes (MDE). Other abnormalities persist following symptom remission, and are found in orbital and medial PFC areas where post mortem studies demonstrate reductions in cortex volume and/or histopathological changes in primary mood disorders. These orbital and medial PFC areas have been shown by other types of evidence to modulate emotional behavior and stress responses, suggesting that dysfunction involving these regions may be involved in the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms. Finally, physiological activity is decreased during MDE in dorsal PFC areas implicated in language, selective attention, visuospatial or mnemonic processing, but these abnormalities reverse with symptom remission. These areas of 'deactivation' during the depressed state may reflect neurophysiological interactions between cognitive and emotional processing, and may relate to the subtle cognitive impairments associated with MDE."

Elevated apathy scores unassociated with elevated depression were most frequent in Alzheimer's disease and right hemisphere stroke, and also occurred in a small number of left hemisphere stroke and normal subjects. In major depression, apathy was associated with high depression scores, although a substantial number of major depressives showed elevated depression without elevated apathy. In left hemisphere stroke, probable Alzheimer's disease, and major depression, there were significant positive correlations between apathy and depression. The slope of the regression of apathy on depression was greatest in probable Alzheimer's disease and major depression.

Clinical investigations have explored the strategy of augmenting SSRIs action by combination with a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. We investigated the relative importance of the effects on ischemia-stimulated neurogenesis and depressive-like behavior of WAY-100635 versus citalopram at different dose levels in PSD animals. Adult rats were exposed to a chronic mild stress paradigm after ischemic surgery. Decreased sucrose consumption was indicative of the core depressive syndrome anhedonia. Proliferating cells and their fate were monitored by bromodeoxyuridine labeling protocols up to 28 days after ischemia. Expression of the 5-HT1A receptor in DG was also examined. The current findings confirmed the ability of WAY-100635 to augment SSRIs pharmacological efficacy and SSRIs-induced elevation of post-stroke DG neurogenesis. Specifically, WAY-100635 and citalopram in different dose combinations display their relative importance in ischemia-stimulated neurogenesis probably through reinforcing serotonergic neurotransmission and/or density of 5-HT1A receptor in DG. The present data extend our understanding that increase of ischemia-induced DG neurogenesis can be interpreted as a valid index, to an extent, or even a prerequisite for an efficient co-treatment strategy."

            "abstract": "Recognition of picture absurdities was found to be significantly impaired in a group of patients with dementia of Alzheimer type compared to patients with dementia syndrome of depression and cerebrovascular dementia, even when matched for age, education, and dementia severity. None of the other neuropsychological measures investigated, including visual recent memory, Raven's progressive matrices, geographic orientation, and copying of geometric figures, resulted in a similar pattern. Although uncertainty remains as to what the picture absurdities test measures, normal performance likely depends on the integrity of many independently assessable variables, in addition to cognition and judgment utilizing visual data."

Measures of psychological symptoms (assessed using the 28-item General Health Questionnaire) and function (modified Barthel Index) were completed at each visit.

Neither was there evidence of a correlation between symptom score and proximity of the lesion to the anterior pole of the left cerebral hemisphere. Psychiatric symptom scores were however greater with larger volume brain lesions.

During an 18-months period all patients who underwent a CT-scan at the Central Institute of Mental Health and who had a single unilateral ischemic hemisphere infarct were initially included. Patients with severe aphasia or cognitive impairment who could not communicate well enough for the administration of depression rating scales were excluded. This led to a selection bias towards larger infarct sizes in the right hemisphere.

However, limitations for screening purposes and for the definitive detection of dementia were noted in view of only moderate predictive power of the tests with discriminant function analysis. Nevertheless, the potential clinical utility of the three tests in the general hospital and other primary care settings was apparent."

            "abstract": "Although a number of studies suggest an association between stroke and depression, few have examined the relation between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-identified lesions and depression among community-dwelling older adults. This cross-sectional study sought to assess the association between MRI infarcts in the basal ganglia and non-basal-ganglia areas, potential functional consequences of these lesions, and depressive symptomatology in 3,371 US men and women aged 65 years or older who participated in the Cardiovascular Health Study between 1992 and 1994. By using multiple linear regression models, the authors found that after adjustment for age, gender, and stroke history, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale scores were independently associated with non-basal-ganglia lesions (p = 0.04) but were not independently associated with basal ganglia lesions (p = 0.11). When measures of physical disability and cognitive impairment were added to the models, these measures displaced MRI-identified infarcts in their association with depressive symptoms. In additional models, hemispheric location and size of the basal ganglia lesion were found to have no relation to depression levels. These results suggest that the functional consequences of cerebrovascular disease may be the causal pathway by which basal ganglia and non-basal-ganglia lesions are associated with depressive symptomatology."

            "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with major depression following stroke have a greater degree of cognitive impairment than nondepressed patients with comparable lesions. The present study examined the longitudinal course of cognitive impairment related to depression. Patients were prospectively evaluated following an acute stroke (N = 309), using a structured psychiatric interview and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Longitudinal evaluations were obtained at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months follow-up in a subset of these patients. During the initial in-hospital evaluation, the frequency and severity of cognitive impairment was significantly greater in patients with major depression compared with nondepressed patients. This effect occurred predominantly in patients with major depression following left hemisphere stroke. The association of depression and cognitive function was strongest during the initial evaluation, but was present for up to 1 year. The year-long effect, however, was evident only in patients with left hemisphere stroke. Patients with both depression and cognitive impairment had a greater duration of depression than depressed patients without cognitive impairment. Depression with cognitive impairment appears to be a phenomenon produced by left hemisphere lesions. This suggests that left hemisphere stroke may produce depression through a different mechanism than lesions in other locations. In addition, the fact that the strongest influence of depression on cognitive function was seen during the initial evaluation suggests that this phenomenon may be mediated by acute or subacute physiological effects of the lesion."

Among various psychiatric disorders, the frequency of three psychiatric disorders, dementia, delirium, and major depression, was relatively high. One-year incidence rate of whole psychiatric disorders was 10.6% (7.1% in non-aged and 13.7% in aged). One-year incidence rate of dementia in aged patients was 4.2% (dementia of the Alzheimer's disease, 0.5%; multi-infarct dementia, 3.7%). One-year incidence rate of multi-infarct dementia in aged HD patients was 7.4 times as large as that in the elderly general populations, suggesting that aged HD patients tend to exhibit multi-infarct dementia. The high incidence rate may be closely related to advanced arteriosclerosis and other medical conditions. Psychiatric management is required for ESRD patients with three major psychiatric disorders, dementia, delirium, and major depression, in particular for aged patients with multi-infarct dementia who has received long-term HD therapy."

Ninety-four stroke inpatients were examined 8 weeks after stroke and reexamined 15 months later. Twenty-one (22%) of the 94 patients suffered from minor depression, 14 (15%) suffered from major depression, and 59 (63%) were not depressed. Minor depressed patients were twice as symptomatic as nondepressed patients but were only half as symptomatic as major depressed patients. Minor depressed patients were more likely than nondepressed patients to have a previous history of stroke and were more physically disabled. They were less likely than major depressed patients to have a family history of affective disorder. Depression symptom severity was associated with greater physical disability among minor but not major depressed patients. Fewer minor than major depressed patients were depressed at 15 months. These findings suggest that poststroke major and minor depression may be different depressive syndromes. Some cases of minor depression may be construed as an adjustment reaction to stroke disability."

Different etiological mechanisms may be involved, and there forms two major hypotheses: biological hypothesis and psychological hypothesis. Biological hypothesis included four mechanisms: lesion location mechanism, neurotransmitters mechanism, inflammatory cytokines mechanism and gene polymorphism mechanism. As for lesion location, the specific location of a lesion (e.g., basal ganglia or left frontal lobe lesions) played an important role in the etiology of PSD. For neurotransmitters, decreased serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain were associated with PSD. In inflammatory cytokines, increased cytokines [including interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor alpha] after stroke lead to depression. For gene polymorphism, there was significant association between serotonin transporter gene-linked promoter region short variant genotype and post-stroke major depression. Psychological hypothesis suggested that social and psychological stressors associated with stroke may be the primary cause of depression. Up to now, there is no definitive evidence to support or refute either a solely biological or solely psychosocial mechanism. It appears to be a kind of biopsychosocial multifactorial mental illness."

Stroke is a major source of long-term disablement and many aspects of life after stroke have been explored. Little attention has been paid to nutritional issues despite the cultural and hedonistic importance of food and eating, and the deleterious effects of malnutrition. The present study employed an epidemiological survey to investigate the contribution of dietary and nutritional factors in relation to QoL after stroke. The participants were 206 survivors of a cohort of acute stroke patients consecutively admitted to a National Health Service trust hospital in South London, UK, between March 1998 and April 1999. They were interviewed in their homes at 6 months post-stroke. Cognitively or communication-impaired patients were precluded from interview except where a live-in carer participated as a proxy (n = 10). The participation rate for those who were eligible and could be contacted was 206 out of 218 (94%). Participants were assessed using standardised, validated tools for functional abilities in activities of daily living and eating, cognition and mood state, social support and economic indices, nutritional status, dietary intake, and QoL. Overall group scores demonstrated relatively minor degrees of physical disablement; exclusion of those with limited cognition and communication precluded assessment of a small subgroup with greater disablement at hospital discharge. Nonetheless, the overall assessment results were not dissimilar to other reported groups. Indices of poor nutritional status and substantial dietary inadequacy were revealed, linked with reduced appetite and depression. Multiple regression analyses revealed the dominant impact of mood state in relation to QoL scores; additional significant effects were identified for social support, eating-related disabilities and age. The effects of mood and social support are well-recognised, whilst nutrition-related effects have previously received little attention. Intervention in these areas might achieve improvements in survivors' perceived QoL."

Treatments aimed at reducing intracranial pressure in patients with such infarcts are of unproven value. Mass-producing cerebellar infarction may lead to brainstem compression and obstructive hydrocephalus. These lesions often are treated surgically. Although anticonvulsants are not indicated for prophylaxis, the occurrence of epileptic seizures mandates treatment to prevent recurrences. Depression is common in the acute stage of stroke, but is probably not more prevalent after stroke than after myocardial infarction. Although dysphagia is common, it usually is a transient problem. Patients with a decrease of consciousness or brainstem dysfunction usually need tube feeding for a certain period of time. Medical complications, such as fever, infections, hyperglycemia, cardiac disorders, pressure sores, and deep venous thrombosis, are associated with a poor prognosis and should be treated as early as possible. Measures to prevent these complications are part of general care.

Here we describe a patient with depression and PTSD with panic attacks following a transient ischemic attack. Many non-psychiatric physicians learn about post-stroke depression so they are equipped to screen for it. However, to many physicians, PTSD with panic attacks usually conjures the image of an individual who experienced either trauma or rape. Therefore, it is important to increase the awareness of such complications after TIAs.

            "abstract": "Of the few studies published on poststroke emotional incontinence (PSEI), none has investigated a consecutive stroke cohort in a Chinese patient population. The objective of this study was to examine the frequency and the clinical and radiological correlates of PSEI in Chinese stroke patients in Hong Kong. Three months after their admission, a psychiatrist interviewed 127 stroke patients who were consecutively admitted to the medical wards of a university-affiliated regional hospital. The presence of PSEI was defined according to both Kim's and House's criteria. The frequency of PSEI was 17.9% according to Kim's criteria and 6.3% according to House's criteria. The kappa between the two sets of criteria was 0.34. Univariate analysis found that PSEI was associated with a younger age, previous history of depression, a higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale total score and cortical infarcts. Multivariate logistic regression suggested that past history of depression and cortical infarcts were independent predictors for PSEI. In conclusion, PSEI is relatively common among Chinese stroke survivors. A previous history of depression or cortical lesions were independent predictors for PSEI. There is a need for a revision of the diagnostic criteria for PSEI."

The diagnosis of PSD is based on clinical evaluation, supported by psychiatric scales, predominantly constructed to assess 'functional' depressive disorders, which can miss important clinical information about PSD. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Poststroke Depression Rating Scale (PSDRS), a diagnostic tool specifically devised to assess depression after stroke, in comparison to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      143 patients were enrolled at their first-ever stroke; 46 subjects received a diagnosis of major depression-like disorder (MDL) and 53 a diagnosis of mood disorder with depressive manifestations (MDDM).

Out of 120 stroke patients screened, 20 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The doses of the drugs were flexible, using side-effects as a guide during treatment. Both intention to treat analysis and efficacy data (excluding patients who had dropped out during the first 2 weeks of treatment) showed that imipramine (mean dose 75 mg daily) plus mianserin (mean dose 25 mg daily) was superior to desipramine (mean dose 66 mg daily) plus mianserin (27 mg daily). The MES was found to be more sensitive than the HAMD for measuring change in depressive states during treatment. The assessment of side-effects using the UKU scale showed good tolerance in general. The only difference between the two treatment groups was seen in micturition disturbances, where the imipramine treated patients had most complaints after 14 days of treatment, but the symptoms disappeared despite continuous treatment."

However, little is known about the role of depression in stroke mortality.\n## METHODS\nThis study examined the association between depressive symptoms and stroke mortality in a prospective study of behavioral, social, and psychological factors related to health and mortality in a community sample of 6676 initially stroke-free adults (45.8% male; 79.1% white; mean age at baseline, 43.4 years) from Alameda County, California. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the 18-item Human Population Laboratory Depression Scale. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the impact of depressive symptoms after controlling for age, sex, race, and other confounders.\n## RESULTS\nA total of 169 stroke deaths occurred during 29 years of follow-up. Reporting 5 or more depressive symptoms at baseline was associated with increased risk of stroke mortality, after adjusting for age, sex, and race (hazard ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.39; P<.006). This association remained significant after additional adjustments for education, alcohol consumption, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, and diabetes (hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.22; P<.02).

Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) may favor the development of LOD, and that the particular forms of vascular depression should be individualized. The Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 allele was shown to be a risk factor for AD. Its role in LOD is controversial, while it is still unknown in vascular depression. Our objective was to clarify the relationship between ApoE epsilon4 allele and LOD in patients with and without CVD. We examined the ApoE phenotypes in a sample of 311 subjects: 50 with vascular LOD, 24 with LOD without CVD, 115 with AD and 122 normal controls (NC). The study of the ApoE epsilon4 allele frequency showed significant differences between: AD group and the vascular LOD and NC groups; LOD group without CVD compared with NC group (p<0.05 to 0.001). The frequency of the epsilon4 allele in the LOD group without CVD did not differ significantly from the AD group, similarly the frequency of the epsilon4 allele in the vascular LOD group was not different from that in NC. The study suggests an association between the ApoE epsilon4 allele and the LOD without CVD. These patients could be at risk of developing AD by an epsilon4-dependent pathway. In contrast, the results show no association between the presence of ApoE epsilon4 allele and vascular depression and provide further evidence in support of the concept that ApoE epsilon4 allele is not associated with clinical CVD."

We have then surveyed and updated the debate between proponents of a neuroanatomical and a psychological interpretation of PSD. Our conclusions have been that the most recent evidence does not support Robinson's influential neuroanatomical model, assuming that a left frontal stroke could provoke a major PSD, indistinguishable from the functional forms of major depression. In the section devoted to the consequences of PSD, we have particularly taken into account the problem of the deleterious influence that PSD could have on functional recovery. The available evidence does not allow us to conclude if an improvement of PSD also leads to an improvement of the patient's functional status. As for the therapy of PSD, a pharmacological treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has proven effective and safe, whereas psychological methods of treatment of patients and their families have not yet given conclusive results."

            "abstract": "The phenotype and genotype of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy and subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) in Caucasians have been well characterized, but CADASIL is less recognized in Asian populations. Here we investigated the first known Taiwanese family affected by CADASIL and identified an uncommon NOTCH3 mutation. The family had clinical manifestations in affected members including recurrent strokes, early dementia, and depression, but not migraine. A skin biopsy in the proband patient showed characteristic pathological findings of CADASIL on electron microscopy. Afterward, genetic analysis found an Arg332Cys mutation at exon 6 of NOTCH3. Neuropsychological evaluation showed vascular dementia in two of four affected people. Head MRI showed multiple infarcts in bilateral basal ganglia, thalami, periventricular white matter, external capsules, and brainstem, but involvement of the anterior temporal pole was found only in two people with milder symptoms. To our knowledge, the Arg332Cys NOTCH3 mutation at exon 6, which was identified in the studied family, has not been reported in Asian populations. Our findings emphasize the importance of genetic analysis of NOTCH3 for Asians with a phenotype typical of CADASIL."

However, the differential effect of aphasic versus nonaphasic stroke on caregivers has not been well studied. This study compares selected outcomes (e.g., perceived task difficulty, depressive symptoms, and other negative stroke-related outcomes) among caregivers of aphasic (n = 46) and nonaphasic (n = 113) stroke survivors. Results indicated that caregivers of aphasic survivors perceived greater difficulty with tasks and had more negative stroke-related outcomes than caregivers of nonaphasic survivors. Communication with the survivor was rated as most upsetting and difficult by caregivers in the aphasic group, followed by managing behaviors. Lack of time for family and friends was evident. Female caregivers and caregivers of survivors with self-care deficits also perceived greater difficulty with tasks and negative outcomes. Comprehensive assessment of the unique needs of caregivers of aphasic survivors is suggested for more individualized nursing interventions."

Dietary folate is required for normal development of the nervous system, playing important roles regulating neurogenesis and programmed cell death. Recent epidemiological and experimental studies have linked folate deficiency and resultant increased homocysteine levels with several neurodegenerative conditions, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, genetic and clinical data suggest roles for folate and homocysteine in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. A better understanding of the roles of folate and homocysteine in neuronal homeostasis throughout life is revealing novel approaches for preventing and treating neurological disorders."

The second period was characterized by a rich pictorial production, with an excellent spatial organization of drawings; the style remained well recognizable and the favourite topics were unchanged: streets' scenes, country women, bunches of flowers. Shapes, drawings and volumes were well preserved. The neglect concerned not only the left hemispace but also the \"microspaces\" on the left side of which the painter's gaze attention had been fixed. Analysis of the production for this period supports the hypothesis according to which the neglect would be explained by a selective defect in automatic orientation of the attention on the left side.

There was enormous interest in the effects of rTMS and signs of therapeutic success in mainly small clinical trials.

Stroke survivors used combinations of multiple coping strategies. All stroke survivors used a higher number and frequency of adaptive rather than maladaptive strategies. Women used a higher number of adaptive strategies. Stroke survivors with depression used maladaptive coping strategies more frequently, whereas those presenting with a greater number and severity of comorbidities used adaptive coping strategies more frequently. Stroke survivors with higher levels of coping self-efficacy used the strategies of active coping and positive reframing more frequently.

On arrival to our hospital, she was found to have flaccid hemiplegia on the left side involving the face, arm, and leg (face and arm more than the leg involvement), severe dysarthria, and mild neglect syndrome (National Health Institute Stroke Scale of 14). Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no signs of early ischemia, and iodine contrast CT angiography revealed right middle cerebral artery (MCA) (distal M1 segment) clot. Patient received intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen (rt-PA) at 2.5 hours after the onset of symptoms, and then a total of 3.0 mg of intra-arterial (IA) rt-PA. Angiography at the end of the procedure showed successful recanalization of the M1 segment and normal vessel caliber with adequate distal flow. After the procedure, the patient made rapid improvements in all of her initial symptoms during the first 24 hours. An extensive stroke workup failed to reveal any cause of the stroke, including usual stroke and hypercoagulable risk factors. This was an acute embolic stroke immediately following an ECT, and without the aggressive thrombolytic therapy, the patient's outcome would have been poor because there was an M1 segment clot with a major MCA syndrome with relatively high National Institute of Health Stroke Scale.

Although overall prevalence of depression did not change significantly over time, the prognosis for individual patients, depending on diagnostic group, was different. All of the follow-up patients with major depression in-hospital were improved by 2 years, with a significant reduction in their mean depression scores and improvement in their activities of daily living, whereas only 30% of follow-up patients with dysthymic depression improved by this time. There was no significant improvement in their mean depression scores or mean activities of daily living score.

From a psychological perspective, depression, which is common in stroke patients, may influence functional recovery and possibly mortality after a stroke. Although somewhat controversial, the risk of poststroke depression may be related to lesion location, specifically left anterior or left basal ganglia lesions. Because poststroke depression can affect recovery, treatment with antidepressants may be warranted. Emerging evidence suggests that nortriptyline and fluoxetine may be effective; paroxetine, sertraline, and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have shown efficacy in treating a related phenomenon known as pathologic crying. The influence of depression on the risk of stroke has not been extensively studied; however, several epidemiologic studies raise the possibility that a relation exists. In one study of elderly individuals, higher depressive symptoms increased the risk of stroke. Many older individuals who have depression develop later in life have evidence of subtle cerebrovascular disease. Specifically, silent strokes that do not involve the sensory or motor parts of the brain are quite common in the elderly population. Vascular depression is depression that occurs in patients with cerebrovascular or ischemic changes in the brain. Preliminary evidence indicates that these vascular changes may be related to atherosclerosis, hypertension, or myocardial infarction. However, additional studies are needed to gain a better profile of these patients and to explore potential treatment modalities."

            "abstract": "Apathy and depression are discriminable but related dimensions of behavior. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the source of the overlap between measures of apathy and depression. We evaluated the intercorrelations between the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HamD) in 107 subjects, aged 53-85, who met research criteria for normal aging, left or right cerebral hemisphere stroke, probable Alzheimer's disease, or major depression. We determined the correlation between the individual items on the HamD and the total scores on the AES and the HamD. The HamD items having the strongest correlations with AES total score were diminished work/interest, psychomotor retardation, anergy, and lack of insight. The correlation between AES and HamD total scores was nonsignificant when major depression subjects and these variables most closely related to apathy were excluded from consideration. These findings indicate that the convergence between HamD and AES is attributable to (i) a subset of HamD items which are consistent with the syndrome of apathy and (ii) the fact that major depression is associated with both apathy and depression. Clinical and research applications of these results are discussed."

            "abstract": "The brain influences and controls the immunologic mechanisms involved in the maintenance of health and bodily integrity. The influence on immune functioning is more likely lateralized with left cerebral involvement than right-sided involvement. Depression, along with the accompanying neuroimmune changes, is found more frequently after left cerebral lesions than after right-sided lesions. Stress, particularly uncontrollable stress, produces hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) dysfunction as measured by elevations in plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone. These changes parallel those seen in many depressed patients. But caution is called for in assessing stress and depression. In everyday life, as opposed to the laboratory, the controllable versus uncontrollable paradigm is not as useful. Attitudes, spiritual resources, hopes, and ideals can neutralize the effects of an uncontrollable stress situation, such as prisoners of war and victims of religious or ethnic persecution might experience. Whether subjective differences in tolerance for such uncontrollable stresses are accompanied by distinguishing indicators of neuroimmune dysfunction has yet to be demonstrated."

It was the goal of the present study to develop a triage for bedside testing and outpatient services. In a prospective clinical cohort study at the outpatient Memory Clinic, University of Ulm, Germany, 232 subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease [AD; NINCDS-ADRDA criteria; n = 66; age 65.9 +/- 7.3 years (mean +/- SD); Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score 23.4 +/- 4.1], mild cognitive impairment (MCI; criteria of Petersen et al.; n = 48; age 66.4 +/- 7.1 years; MMSE score 28.3 +/- 1.5), and major depressive disorder (DSM-IV criteria; n = 61; age 63.4 +/- 8.0 years; MMSE score 28.6 +/- 1.6). Diagnosis was secured with extensive neuropsychological, clinical, radiological, and laboratory investigations. Six brief screening tests including the Memory Impairment Screen (MIS), Letter Sorting Test (LST), Verbal Fluency (VF), and Clock Drawing Test (CDT) were assessed independently from the diagnostic procedure. We compared single items and composite scores. LST yielded a diagnostic accuracy of 0.81 and 0.62 for AD and MCI patients versus controls, respectively. With the MIS, diagnostic accuracy was 0.89 and 0.71, respectively. With a combination of LST, MIS, VF, and CDT, a sensitivity for AD and MCI patients of 1.00 and 0.83 was achieved. Thus, single-item screening (e.g. LST, VF) taking little more than 1 min and suitable for bedside testing or brief screening in the general practitioner's office yields diagnostic accuracy comparable to standard laboratory tests for other diseases. A composite of screening tests suitable for application in general outpatient care in neurological and psychiatric services reliably detects patients with AD and MCI."

The severity of brain WMH was classified with the Fazekas scale. We used standardized scales to assess melancholic MDD, atypical MDD, and MDD with anger attacks. In logistic regression analyses, MDD with anger attacks was associated with higher severity of subcortical WMH and of total WMH, but not with periventricular WMH.

Treatment resistance may be associated with vascular-based lesions in the white matter and basal ganglia. Virchow-Robin spaces (VRS) are cerebrospinal fluid spaces associated with microangiopathy of small cerebral vessels. This study tested the hypothesis that dilation of Virchow-Robin spaces seen on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is associated with treatment resistance in elderly depressed individuals.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      50 patients with late-onset (age over 60 years) major depressive disorder (29 responders to monotherapy, 21 non-responders to monotherapy) and 35 normal volunteers were recruited. Assessment of deep white matter lesions [WML] and periventricular hyperintensities [PVH] (both with the Scheltens rating scale score, [Scheltens, P., Barkhof, F., Leys, D., et al.

A score of 2 or greater on the VRS score was 80% sensitive and 62% specific in predicting non-response to antidepressant monotherapy. The VRS score accounted for 38% of the variance in the multiple regression model and the PVH score, which was an independent predictor of outcome, contributed another 6%.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      Numbers are small and type II errors possible, especially for the Scheltens ratings.

The \"vascular depression\" hypothesis is supported by the comorbidity of depression, vascular disease, and vascular risk factors and the association of ischemic lesions to distinctive behavioral symptoms. Disruption of prefrontal systems or their modulating pathways by single lesions or by an accumulation of lesions exceeding a threshold are hypothesized to be central mechanisms in vascular depression. The vascular depression concept can generate studies of clinical and heuristic value. Drugs used for the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease may be shown to reduce the risk for vascular depression or improve its outcomes. The choice of antidepressants in vascular depression may depend on their effect on neurologic recovery from ischemic lesions. Research can clarify the pathways to vascular depression by focusing on the site of the lesion, the resultant brain dysfunction, the presentation of depression and time of onset, and the contribution of nonbiological factors."

Review of the patient literature suggests that such cerebrovascular events in the setting of ECT are extremely rare and possibly decreasing in frequency. Reasons for such a decrease may include improved screening for predisposing cardiovascular conditions and the widespread use of neuromuscular blockade, ventilatory support, and cardiovascular monitoring during the procedure.

In conclusion, we interpreted these depressive symptoms as the result of reactive coping strategies during the acute phase of cerebral ischemia. In contrast to this, the aspect of gender showed no significant relationship to the resulting depressive symptoms.

Despite the extensive literature on this topic, there is no agreement on causal mechanisms, risk factors and consequences of PSD. Stroke patients with PSD suffer higher mortality rates and show a minor improvement in rehabilitation programs in comparison to non depressed stroke patients. Consequently, they have worse functional outcomes and quality of life. The available evidence supports PSD as being multifactorial in origin, and consistent with the biopsychosocial model of mental illness. Nonetheless, the stroke itself poses the risk of depression. Stroke survivors are more predisposed to PSD compared to physically ill patients with similar levels of disability, even quite a long time after the stroke, regardless of other risk factors. Early effective treatment of depression may have a positive effect not only on depressive symptoms but also on the rehabilitation outcome of stroke patients. On the other hand, there is no definitive evidence that antidepressants or psychotherapy are useful to prevent depression.

The evidence for this is controversial but is important to any proposed organic model of depression in the elderly. Here, early- and late-onset depressions in later life are compared.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Fifty-seven depressed patients with a mean age of 74 were studied, 21 with an early onset (aged 59 or less) and 36 with a late onset. All were suffering from major depression according to DSM-III-R. The measures at entry included severity and symptoms, cognitive function, antecedent life events, physical health and vascular risk factors and/or vascular disease. We also recorded any family history of mood disorders, as well as the course of illness.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The anxiety item scores of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were significantly higher in those with an early onset, but otherwise symptoms differed little. Heritability was greater in the early-onset group. There was a striking association of vascular disease and/or risk with late-onset patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Vascular disease is associated with late-onset depression. This is consistent with the hypothesis that depression in later life is a more 'biological' disorder."

Moreover, depression following brainstem and/or cellebellar infarcts was of significantly shorter duration than depression following MCA lesions. These differences in the frequency and duration of depression following brainstem/cerebellar as compared with MCA lesions were not explained by differences in lesion volume, physical impairment, cognitive deficits or quality of social support.

Perceived expectations of others, perceived control and awareness of guidelines also differentiated those intending to screen from 'non-intenders'.

Proportional-hazards analysis was used to determine the independent effect of post-stroke depression on functional outcome. Comparisons between sitting balance and psychological status were performed using logistic multiple regression analysis. Cox multiple regression analysis showed that significant differences were obtained for the sitting balance (P < 0.0002) and Mini-Mental State Examination scores (P < 0.02) in all six ADL subscales, and for age in four of the six ADL subscales (Dressing-Upper Body and Dressing-Lower Body, Toileting, Walking).

            "abstract": "The hospital charts of elderly stroke patients with major depression, as determined by DSM-III-R criteria, who were treated with either methylphenidate (n = 28) or nortriptyline (n = 30) were retrospectively reviewed. Fifty-three percent of the methylphenidate patients experienced complete remission of depressive symptoms. Similarly, 43% of the patients in the nortriptyline group showed remission of depressive symptomatology. Whereas the response rates between the two treatment groups were not significantly different in the patients who did respond to treatment (chi 2 = .608, df = 1, p = NS), the speed of response was significantly better in the methylphenidate group (t[13] = 15.9, p < .001). The average peak response time for the methylphenidate patients was 2.4 days compared to 27 days for the nortriptyline group. This finding is consistent with previous reports suggesting a rapid response to methylphenidate and other psychostimulants, typically between 24 and 72 hours. Adverse side effects, such as cardiac changes, did not differ between groups, generally falling in the mild range of severity. These data suggest that the rapid effects of methylphenidate may be especially useful to speed recovery from depression so that patients can participate more fully in rehabilitation programs."

In an effort to address certain of those methodologic issues and further investigate the frequency and clinical determinants of depression after stroke, we administered the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (SIGH-D) and neurological, neuropsychological, and functional assessments to 421 patients (age = 71.5 +/- 8.0 years) 3 months after ischemic stroke and 249 stroke-free control subjects (age = 70.8 +/- 6.7 years). We required a SIGH-D total score > 11 for the identification of depression. We found that depression was less frequent (47/421 patients, or 11.2%, and 13/249 control subjects, or 5.2%), less severe, and less persistent in our stroke cohort than previously reported, possibly due to the underrepresentation of patients with a premorbid history of affective illness. Depression was associated with more severe stroke, particularly in vascular territories that supply limbic structures; dementia; and female sex. SIGH-D item analyses suggested that a reliance on nonsomatic rather than somatic symptoms would result in the most accurate diagnoses of depression after ischemic stroke."

We conceptualized memory impairment as a marker of preexisting cerebrovascular disease. We hypothesized that if depressive symptoms are causally related to stroke through mechanisms unrelated to cerebrovascular disease, depressive symptoms should predict stroke independently of memory impairment.\n## METHODS\nIncidence of first stroke was assessed with self or proxy reports from 19,087 participants in the Health and Retirement Study cohort (1,864 events). Elevated depressive symptoms (3+ on an 8-item Centers for the Epidemiologic Study of Depression scale) and memory impairment (score of ≤6 on a combined immediate and delayed recall of a 10-word list) were used as predictors of incident stroke in Cox survival models with adjustment for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors.\n## RESULTS\nAfter adjustment for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors, elevated depressive symptoms (hazard ratio = 1.25; 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.39) and memory impairment (hazard ratio = 1.26; 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.41) each predicted stroke incidence in separate models. Hazard ratios were nearly unchanged and remained significant (1.23 for elevated depressive symptoms and 1.25 for memory impairment) when models were simultaneously adjusted for both elevated depressive symptoms and memory impairment. Elevated depressive symptoms also predicted stroke when restricting analyses to individuals with median memory score or better.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nMemory impairments and depressive symptoms independently predict stroke incidence. Memory impairment may reflect undiagnosed cerebrovascular disease. These results suggest that depressive symptoms might be directly related to stroke rather than merely indicating preexisting cerebrovascular disease.\n"

            "abstract": "As we learn more about the relationships between depression and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), a complex picture is emerging in which the chain of causality seems to spiral on itself: progressive or focal brain damage, cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, dementia, and cardiovascular diseases, all seem to be liable to lead to one or another. Stroke may lead to depression, and the inverse may also be true. Depression may lead to cognitive impairment and cardiovascular diseases, which in turn may lead to subtle brain impairment, thereby causing more depression and cognitive impairments, and so on. In this presentation, we provide a rapid glance at the complexities of such issues."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) often occurs after stroke and has a negative impact on the rehabilitation process. Several studies focused either on short- or on long-term PSF and their relations with stroke characteristics. However, possible pre-stroke risk factors such as history of depression, pre-existent white matter lesions or brain atrophy were usually not taken into account. Therefore, the precise mechanisms underlying PSF remain still unclear. This study was aimed at assessing the possible contributions of (pre-)stroke factors to both short-term PSF and its course over time.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study pertains to 108 patients with an acute cerebral infarction. PSF was rated by the Checklist Individual Strength at 2 months and 1.5 year post-stroke. The relation between (pre-)stroke factors and PSF was assessed with multivariate regression analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of baseline PSF was 35% and at follow-up 33%. Older age had a protective effect on PSF at baseline (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.91-0.98), whereas post-stroke depressive symptoms and infratentorial infarctions were related to an increased risk for PSF (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.21-1.63 and OR 4.69; 95% CI 1.03-21.47, respectively). Baseline fatigue was related to an increased risk of PSF at follow-up (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.09-1.22).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Predictors for baseline fatigue were younger age, post-stroke depressive symptoms, and infratentorial infarctions. Baseline fatigue did predict fatigue outcome over time, suggesting that early interventions might be useful to prevent deteriorated PSF."

Eighty-two percent of the patients showed improvement after psychostimulant treatment. Forty-seven percent of all patients showed marked or moderate improvement in depressive symptoms. The authors saw no significant differences in efficacy between the two psychostimulants or across the diagnostic categories for depression. Patients improved quickly, usually within the first 2 days of treatment. Adverse reactions necessitating the termination of psychostimulant treatment occurred in three patients. Anorexia was not observed as a side effect of either dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate treatment. Psychostimulants appear to be a safe and rapidly effective alternative to tricyclic antidepressants in inpatients with post-stroke depression."

Although somatic symptoms of stroke may be mistaken for depression, DSM-III criteria for major depression are appropriate for use in this clinical setting. The etiology of poststroke depression can be viewed from a number of perspectives. Evidence from examining lesion characteristics and depression suggests that a disease model is suitable for some cases of poststroke depression. Alternatively, adequacy of social support and gender differences influence the occurrence of poststroke depression. Poststroke depression can be effectively treated with tricyclic antidepressants, and the use of these agents may also enhance physical and cognitive recovery."

The stress-vulnerability hypothesis predicts that the depressogenic effect of psychosocial risk is stronger in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs).

Vascular risk may increase one's vulnerability to depression by exacerbating the impact of stress on depression. One hypothesis for this finding is that vascular disease disrupts mood regulation circuits in the brain, which decrease its ability to respond to stressful events."
