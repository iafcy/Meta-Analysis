            "criteria": "Studies were selected if they (1) were randomized trials; (2) examined the efficacy of a psychosocial prevention program in reducing any type of sexual violence, such as sexual harassment, unwanted touching, or rape; (3) the program was compared with a control group, which could include no intervention, wait-list, or active controls (ie, minimal interventions, lectures on health, usual practice); and (4) was delivered to adolescents. Adolescents were defined as middle or high school students or individuals aged 10 to 19 years, as described by the World Health Organization.15 We excluded reviews, qualitative studies, nonrandomized studies, quasi-experimental studies, and articles that were not published in peer-reviewed journals. We also excluded studies or group comparisons that (1) were not psychosocial programs, such as those based only on cash transfers or on the legislation of sexual-related crimes; (2) did not follow up with the same cohort of participants; (3) compared different prevention programs with no control group; (4) targeted college or university students; (5) assessed sexual violence outcomes by behavioral counts or through official records; or (6) did not include enough information to compute effect sizes and raw data could not be retrieved after contacting the authors of the study.",
