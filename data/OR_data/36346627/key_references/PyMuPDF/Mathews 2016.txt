Abstract Young South Africans, especially women, are at
high risk of HIV. We evaluated the effects of PREPARE, a
multi-component, school-based HIV prevention interven-
tion to delay sexual debut, increase condom use and
decrease intimate partner violence (IPV) among young
adolescents. We conducted a cluster RCT among Grade
eights in 42 high schools. The intervention comprised
education sessions, a school health service and a school
sexual violence prevention programme. Participants com-
pleted
questionnaires
at
baseline,
6
and
12 months.
Regression was undertaken to provide ORs or coefﬁcients
adjusted for clustering. Of 6244 sampled adolescents,
55.3 % participated. At 12 months there were no differ-
ences between intervention and control arms in sexual risk
behaviours. Participants in the intervention arm were less
likely to report IPV victimisation (35.1 vs. 40.9 %; OR
0.77, 95 % CI 0.61–0.99; t(40) = 2.14) suggesting the
intervention shaped intimate partnerships into safer ones,
potentially lowering the risk for HIV.

Introduction
Globally, HIV is ranked second among the leading causes
of death among adolescents [1]. Among adolescents and
youth in South Africa, there has been little progress in
preventing new infections. Although declining somewhat,
the HIV prevalence and incidence among young South
Africans 15–24 years remains high, especially among
women [2–4]. In the Western Cape, South Africa, the
setting of this study, HIV is still the leading cause of pre-
mature mortality (http://www.mrc.ac.za/bod/WC2010Re
port.pdf), and adolescents commonly report an early sexual
debut and unprotected sex [5]. These behaviours increase
the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI) including
HIV.
In South Africa, adolescents’ intimate relationships are
marked by a high incidence of violence [6]. Sexual vio-
lence and intimate partner violence (IPV) increase the risk
of STIs including HIV among women [7]. This implies that
to be effective, HIV prevention interventions should
include a focus on preventing sexual violence and IPV. In
the Western Cape and Limpopo provinces of South Africa,
cluster RCTs of school-based HIV prevention interventions
without a focus on IPV, failed to demonstrate an impact on
the timing of sexual debut or condom use among the

younger adolescent participants (average age 13 years) and
also failed to impact on IPV [5]. However, in the Eastern
Cape, a community-based HIV and IPV prevention pro-
gramme for adolescents 16 years and older, which included
a substantial focus on IPV, showed a beneﬁcial impact on
STI incidence and male IPV perpetration [8].
In our cluster randomised controlled trial, PREPARE,
conducted
among
young
adolescents
(average
age
13 years) in the Western Cape, we evaluated an HIV pre-
vention programme that included a focus on IPV and
sexual violence reduction. In the current trial we tested the
hypothesis that the PREPARE programme would 1. delay
sexual debut; 2. increase the use of condoms; 3. decrease
the number of sexual partners among young adults. A
secondary objective was to assess the effect of the inter-
vention on IPV, and (not reported here) the three-year
incidence of conceptions among female participants.
Methods
Intervention
The intervention was multi-component, comprising an
educational programme, a school health service and a
school safety programme, and described in detail in
Table 1. The educational programme consisted of 21 ses-
sions delivered once a week, immediately when school
ended, in the school premises. The session duration ranged
from 1 to 1.5 h. Sessions included up to 25 participants,
and the education methods were interactive and skills-
based. The programme was built upon the Respect4U
programme, an IPV and HIV prevention intervention
which was developed based on the Jewkes conceptual
framework [9], and piloted-tested among Grade 8 students
in nine typical Western Cape high schools over 3 years
[10]. It was also informed by social cognition models
including the Reasoned Action Framework [11] and the
I-Change theoretical model [12]. Staff employed by the
PREPARE project, who had been screened for positive
gender norms and comfort with sexuality education and
condom demonstrations, facilitated groups of up to 25
participants. The facilitators received a two-week training
course and subsequent weekly training, supervision and
session preparation support.
The school health service (SHS) was implemented in
collaboration with the Western Cape Department of Health,
the City of Cape Town Health Department, and the Des-
mond Tutu HIV Foundation. A nurse from the public clinic
nearest to the school delivered the service in the school
premises, once a week immediately after school ended. The
service was modeled on the new South African Integrated
School Health Policy (http://www.health-e.org.za/2013/10/
24/integrated-school-health-policy/),
was
free,
and
involved SRH education, identiﬁcation of need for SRH
services or commodities and referral for such services or
commodities to the nearest community clinic, where they
were provided free of charge. Some clinics were also able
to send a health promoter to assist with health education.
There are no known randomized controlled trials of the
impact of SHS on adolescent SRH, however they are
considered to be an accessible and acceptable strategy [13].
The school safety programme comprised two initiatives.
School safety teams were invited to a two-day training at a
central venue, conducted by the PREPARE team with the
Centre for Justice and Crime Prevention (CJCP) (a non-
government organisation). We implemented ‘‘Photovoice’’,
a carefully piloted programme [14], for twenty, randomly
selected students at each school, facilitated by two PRE-
PARE researchers.
Control Condition
Participants in the control schools received school as usual,
which excluded the after-school programme, the school
health service and the safety programme.
Sampling
The study population comprised adolescents in Grade 8
(average age 13) in public high schools in the Western
Cape. The sample size was calculated to have the power to
show an intervention effect on the annual incidence of the
primary outcome of sexual debut. We estimated 83 % of
the participants would report they had not yet had their
sexual debut at baseline [5]; 17 % of participants in the
control arm would have their sexual debut during the
PREPARE follow-up period of 1 year [5]; an intra-class
correlation coefﬁcient (ICC) of 0.06; and 20 % participant
drop-out after 1 year. We used the Hayes and Bennett
formula [15] to estimate that we would need 19 schools in
each arm, with 62 of 75 participants pre-sexual debut at
baseline in each school, to show a 50 % relative reduction
in 1 year incidence of sexual debut (17 % in control
schools and 8.5 % in intervention schools) with 80 %
power for a 2-sided test with a signiﬁcance level of 5 %.
We sampled 40 schools to allow for one school per arm
to drop out of the study. They were randomly sampled
using the database of 359 public high schools in the
Western Cape Province. Of the 359 schools, before sam-
pling we excluded: 1 school with Grade 12 pass rates
below 40 % (indicating their inability to deliver on their
core educational mandate); 33 schools with pass rates
above 97 % (indicating well-resourced schools already
able to offer students the types of interventions proposed
by PREPARE); 67 schools in two of the eight districts

situated more than 3-h drive from Cape Town; and schools
participating in other HIV prevention trials. After sampling
40 schools, we found that some of them did not have the
required 75 Grade 8 students. We paired four small schools
to create two sampling units, and we randomly sampled
two more schools from the database, generating a total
sample of 42 schools (40 sampling units).
Randomisation and Masking
We stratiﬁed schools into two strata based on the Grade 12
pass rate which we assumed was an indication of how well
the school functioned and its potential ability to beneﬁt
from the PREPARE programme. We found that pass rate
was correlated with the amount of school fees charged,
indicating it is also a reﬂection of socioeconomic status.
Before allocating schools to conditions, we invited each of
the 42 schools to participate, and all accepted.
To ensure allocation sequence concealment, a statisti-
cian at the South African Medical Research Council who
did not have any knowledge of the schools, allocated them
within each stratum to intervention and control arms of the
study. Using a spreadsheet, he ordered the school names
randomly within each stratum and then used a random
number generator to give each school a number. Within
each stratum, he allocated the schools with the lowest
random numbers to the intervention arm, and the other half
to the control arm. We selected classes randomly so that we
would obtain a sample of at least 75 assenting students per
school with signed parental consent.
After allocation assignment, the director of one of the
Department of Health sub-districts requested that we
exclude three of the participating schools because they had
been identiﬁed for a Department of Health intervention.
One had been allocated to the comparison arm and two to
the intervention arm. We replaced these schools with ran-
domly selected schools from the database, and the statis-
tician randomly assigned one to the control arm and two to
the intervention arm. When we were making plans to
conduct the baseline survey, one school in the control arm
withdrew from the study because they were unable to ﬁnd
time for the survey. We did not replace this school (Fig. 1).
We were not able to mask intervention assignment.
Recruitment of Participants
We sampled all Grade 8 classes in the selected schools, or,
in large schools, we randomly selected Grade 8 classes to
ensure at least 75 participants. We invited 6244 Grade 8
students in the 41 schools to participate in the PREPARE

trial and 3451 (55.3 %) returned signed parental consent
forms, gave assent and participated in the baseline survey
in February and March 2013 (Fig. 1). In the intervention
schools, participants were given an invitation to the after-
school programme after they had completed the baseline
survey. To encourage attendance, we offered refreshments
at each session and small stationary gifts at selected ses-
sions. Each participant had a ‘‘loyalty card’’ which was
stamped at each session or nurse consultation. We gave
R50.00 (* US$5) supermarket gift voucher and a certiﬁ-
cate for those who attended at least 15 sessions.
Measures
The instrument comprised a paper, self-administered
questionnaire for each of the surveys (baseline and 6 and
12 months post-baseline) with a set of common questions
across time points. Each question was provided in the three
languages commonly spoken, and printed in full colour in
an adolescent-friendly format resembling a ‘‘teen maga-
zine’’. The questionnaire was informed by an instrument
used in a previous study [5] and formative qualitative
research we conducted with adolescents in six schools to
identify the salient attitudes, beliefs, and social norms that
served as barriers and facilitators to safe sexual behaviour.
It was piloted (including conducting group cognitive
interviews after students completed it in a classroom set-
ting) and revised during 2011 to ensure maximum face
validity and reliability of measures. The surveys were
conducted during school hours and completion of the
questionnaire took on average 45 min. At the 6- and
12-month surveys, we visited the school up to three times
in an attempt to increase retention of absent participants. In
the 12-month survey, we surveyed students who had left
the participating school at their new school, at their home
or at a convenient venue in the community in which they
lived. (We had obtained consent to make such arrange-
ments and had collected contact details of all participants).
The behavioural outcome variables and the variables
measuring theorized motivational determinants and their
psychometric properties are described in Table 2. The
items to measure IPV were adapted from the WHO multi-
country study [16].
We measured participants’ attendance at each of the 21
weekly after-school education sessions over 6 months
between February and September 2013, using a register of
participants, and roll calls at each session. School nurses
kept registers of the participants who consulted them and

individual patient records. Each participant’s attendance
records were linked with the data from their baseline
survey.
Process Evaluation
Process data were collected in the 6- and 12-month follow-
up questionnaires. To assess ﬁdelity to the intervention,
facilitators of the education sessions were observed at
random, unannounced times by two independent observers,
for a total of two sessions each in different schools. Their
performance was scored from 1 to 5 on 13 aspects of
session facilitation. A score of 1 indicated that aspect had
not been achieved, and a score of 5 indicated that aspect
had been excellent. The 13 aspects were grouped into
following three dimensions: interaction with learners (for
example, listened attentively); session ﬁdelity (for exam-
ple, implemented all activities); facilitation skills (for
example, encouraged learners’ involvement). Each of the
14 facilitator’s scores was summed and averaged for the 4
observations.
Analysis
We computed the dimensionality and internal consistency
of the scales measuring the motivational constructs and
then calculated mean scores per construct. We performed a
baseline descriptive analysis of the participants’ demo-
graphics, self-reported sexual risk behaviour and scores on
the motivational constructs in intervention and comparison
arms. At the 6 and 12 months follow-ups, we report the
estimates in the intervention and comparison groups for the
three primary sexual behaviour outcomes and ﬁve other
sexual behaviour outcomes; the two secondary IPV out-
comes and four other variables measuring sexual coercion;
and 17 motivational constructs related to the primary out-
comes. Regression was undertaken to provide outcomes at
6 and 12 months with odds ratios for dichotomous vari-
ables and coefﬁcients for continuous variables, adjusted for
baseline demographics (age, gender, socio-economic sta-
tus), the baseline measure in question, and clustering using
the complex samples approach in SPSS Version 20. These
analyses were carried out among the full sample, the sub-
sample that attended at least 1 session, and the subsample
that attended at least 10 sessions (50 %) in order to be able
to detect the effect of attendance rate on outcomes. In
addition to these complete case analyses, all analyses were
repeated on a data ﬁle that had missing values on latent
factors imputed by applying the expectation–maximisation
algorithm (EM). The EM algorithm uses maximum likeli-
hood estimators and is considered one of the most favoured
ways to impute missing data [17].
Results
Response Rate and Retention
We sampled 6244 adolescents in 41 schools, and 3451
(55.3 %) obtained signed parental consent and assented to
participate (Fig. 1). The non-responders included 69 stu-
dents and 281 parents who declined, and the remaining
were students who did not bring back signed parental
consent forms. Retention at 6 months was 94.1 % and at
12 months 87.9%.
Exposure at the School Level
We implemented the after-school educational programme
in all 20 intervention schools, but in two schools we were
unable to complete it. In one of the two, the programme
was interrupted by a religious fast. In the other, the school
could no longer ﬁnd a free afternoon for the sessions. We
trained nurses and health promoters for 17 of the 20
intervention schools, and the school health service operated
in 17 schools. The public health services did not have
capacity to provide school health nurses for two of the
remaining schools and in one, the school was not able to
allocate an afternoon session for the school health service.
The school safety teams of 18 of the 20 intervention
schools participated in the school safety training, and we
trained 53 school safety team delegates in total. None of
the schools implemented participatory safety audits or
develop safety plans during the 6 months following the
safety training. We implemented the Photovoice pro-
gramme in 10 of the 20 intervention schools. In two of
these schools we did not complete the implementation of
Photovoice because students did not feel safe taking pho-
tographs in the school premises (one school) and because
attendance had dwindled (one school). An overview of
exposure at the school level shows that seven schools were
exposed to all four components of the intervention (edu-
cational sessions, school health service, school safety
training and Photovoice); seven schools had all compo-
nents except Photovoice; two schools had all components
except the health service; two schools had all components
except the safety training; and two schools were exposed to
only the educational sessions and the school safety training.
Exposure at the Individual Participant Level
In intervention schools the mean (M) attendance of PRE-
PARE education sessions was 8.02 sessions (Standard
Deviation (DS): 7.44; range 0–21) and was higher among
girls (M: 8.8; SD 7.5) than boys (M: 6.9; SD 7.2). We
recorded 363 (40.8 %) females and 330 (51.2 %) males
AIDS Behav (2016) 20:1821–1840

attended fewer than 5 sessions; 272 females (30.6 %) and
141 males (21.9 %) attended more than 15 sessions. The
PREPARE school nurse was visited by 17.3 % of the trial
participants in intervention schools, (14.9 % of boys and
18.7 % of girls). Attendance of the 20 randomly selected
participants in Photovoice varied between 7 and 20
students.
Fidelity to Programme
The average facilitator performance scores ranged from
32.3 to 58.7 out of a maximum score of 65. Eleven of the
ﬁfteen facilitators scored above 50/65 indicating that the
sessions were conducted with a moderately high degree of
ﬁdelity by the majority of facilitators. Three facilitators
scored below 50. On closer inspection 2 of these 3 facili-
tators scored low on interaction with learners, yet had
acceptable scores on session ﬁdelity and facilitation skills.
The other facilitator had low scores on all 3 dimensions,
but none of the scores was below 25.
Acceptability to Students
The intervention was highly acceptable to the participants
in the intervention arm with three-quarters (1003; 75.1 %)
rating the PREPARE after-school sessions as ‘‘excellent’’
or ‘‘very good’’; 262 (19.5 %) rating ‘‘good’’ or ‘‘fair’’; and
32
(2.3 %)
rating
‘‘bad’’
to
‘‘extremely
bad’’.
The
remaining 39 (2.9 %) selected ‘‘I did not attend’’.
Effect Evaluation
At baseline there were no signiﬁcant differences between
participants in the intervention and comparison arms of the
study (Table 3). The adjusted outcomes at ﬁrst follow-up
(Table 4) showed no signiﬁcant differences by study arm in
sexual debut (10.5 vs. 9.3 %; AOR: 1.09; 95 % CI
0.82–1.45), self-reported condom use at last sex (79.2 vs.
83.0 %; AOR: 0.69; 95 % CI 0.34–1.37), number of sexual
partners in the past 6 months (0.56 vs. 0.31; B: 0.35; 95 %
CI -0.37–1.07). Participants in the intervention arm had
signiﬁcantly better condom and HIV/AIDS knowledge
scores compared with the control arm. The intracluster
correlations for the primary and secondary outcomes were:
sexual debut: 0.016; condom use at last sex: insufﬁcient
statistical power to calculate; number of sexual partners:
0.049; IPV victimization: 0.022; IPV perpetration: 0.024.
The adjusted outcomes at the 12-month follow-up
(Table 5) showed no differences between intervention and
control arms in 1-year incidence of self-reported sexual
debut (12.7 vs. 12.0 %; AOR: 1.07; 95 % CI 0.83–1.40),
self-reported condom use at last sex (80.6 vs. 83.5 %;
AOR: 0.64, 95 % CI 0.33–1.25), number of sexual partners
in the past 12 months (0.62 vs. 0.40; B: -0.03; 95 % CI
-0.71 to 0.64). Participants in the intervention arm
reported signiﬁcantly better condom knowledge scores and
lower rates of IPV in comparison to the control arm.
Baseline rates of past 6-month IPV victimization were
high, but these dropped in absolute terms, by over 10 % in
the intervention arm and 4.6 % in the control arm. Partic-
ipants in the intervention arm were more likely to report
using contraception (other than condoms) than those in the
control arm (28.1 vs. 22.1 %) but the difference was not
statistically signiﬁcant.
Effect of Rate of Session-Attendance on Outcomes
Since attendance was voluntary and attendance rates ran-
ged substantially among those in the intervention arm [18],
additional subgroup analyses were performed ﬁrstly among
participants who attended at least 1 intervention session,
and secondly among participants who attended at least 10
intervention sessions (Table 6). After 6 months, partici-
pants who attended at least 1 session reported better
knowledge of condoms and HIV and more positive atti-
tudes towards delaying sex in comparison to the control
arm. Participants, who attended more than 10 sessions,
reported better knowledge of condoms and HIV, more
positive attitudes towards condom use and delaying sex,
less IPV victimization, but also more sexual debut in
comparison to the control arm. After 12 months, partici-
pants who attended at least 1 session reported better
knowledge of condoms and HIV, and less IPV victimisa-
tion. Participants who attended more than 10 sessions
reported better knowledge of condoms and HIV, and more
positive attitudes towards condoms and delaying sex
(Table 6).
When all previously mentioned analyses were repeated
using the expectation-maximisation algorithm to impute
missing data, the results were similar: there were no
additional signiﬁcant effects or effects that ceased to exist
in comparison to the complete case analyses (results not
shown).
Discussion
This evaluation of the PREPARE after-school behavioural
HIV prevention programme, which included a focus on
IPV prevention, provided no evidence that it reduced
sexual
risk
behaviour.
Despite
beneﬁcial
effects
on
knowledge about HIV prevention, our evaluation gave no
indication that participants in the intervention arm of the
PREPARE trial were less likely to have their sexual debut,
were more likely to use condoms or had fewer sexual
partners than those in the comparison arm. There was also
1830
AIDS Behav (2016) 20:1821–1840
123

no indication that students who attended a greater number
of education sessions reported less sexual risk behaviour
than those in the control condition. Nor was there any
suggestion that the ‘‘quality’’ of sexual debut was superior
among the intervention participants: there were no differ-
ences between arms in an indicator of a ‘‘safe and good’’
sexual debut, deﬁned by use of condoms and contraception
at ﬁrst sex, absence of coercion at ﬁrst sex, and absence of
regret about ﬁrst sex (data not shown).
These ﬁndings are consistent with a previous trial of an
in-school HIV prevention intervention in the Western
Cape, the SATZ trial, which failed to impact sexual risk

behaviour [5]. They are also consistent with the SATZ trial
in Limpopo province [5]. However, they are not consistent
with the ﬁndings of a meta-analysis of South African
sexual risk reduction interventions among adolescents and
youth, which found the interventions delayed sexual
intercourse, increased condom use and reduced the number
of sex partners [19]. The meta analysis suggested that
features of interventions successful at delaying sexual
intercourse and increasing condom use relative to the
control condition were a focus on social norms, condom
skills, gender inequalities and alcohol [19]. (All these
factors were addressed in PREPARE).
One explanation for the failure of PREPARE in reduc-
ing sexual risk behavior is that, in the Western Cape set-
ting, the contextual constraints on safe sexual behaviour
might
mitigate
against
any
positive
impact

PREPARE intervention. Apart from IPV and sexual vio-
lence, there are numerous social and environmental factors
which undermine adolescent sexual and reproductive
health, which were not addressed in the PREPARE pro-
gramme, and which might be particularly relevant in the
study setting. For example, the PREPARE programme did
not include interventions to ensure adolescents had safe,
supportive homes, secure livelihoods, and social protec-
tion, factors important for adolescent sexual and repro-
ductive health [1, 20]. However, these structural barriers to
safe sexual behaviours apply to the other South African
settings in which effective sexual risk reduction interven-
tions have been demonstrated [19].
Another explanation for the absence of a beneﬁcial
effect on sexual behaviour is that adolescents might need to
have a much greater intensity of exposure to the compo-
nents of the PREPARE intervention, to achieve reductions
in sexual risk behaviour. We have shown that exposure to
the PREPARE after-school education sessions and school
health service was sub-optimal. The ﬁndings of an HIV
prevention trial in the Eastern Cape, South Africa suggest
that

facilitator-to-adolescent ratio are important factors in
reducing sexual risk. Young adolescents who received
intense exposure an in-school HIV/STI risk reduction
intervention comprising twelve 1-h modules in small-
groups, with very low participant-to-facilitator ratios (two
facilitators to between nine and 16 participants), reported
less unprotected sex over several subsequent years [21].
Further evidence in support of this explanation comes from
a meta-analysis of the effects of South African sexual risk
reduction interventions. It found that interventions were
successful in delaying sexual intercourse and increasing
condom use among youth when they used more facilitators
to deliver the intervention and participants received a
higher ‘‘dose’’ [19]. The most efﬁcient way to ensure
young adolescents have adequate exposure to HIV risk
reduction interventions is to embed such interventions in
the school curriculum. After-school programmes often do
not achieve high levels of exposure because it is difﬁcult to
obtain high attendance rates and such programmes tend to
selectively attract participants who are less vulnerable to
adverse outcomes [18].
Our study suggests that behavioural HIV prevention
programmes which include a focus on IPV prevention do
indeed reduce self-reported intimate partner violence. In
our evaluation, we found high baseline rates of IPV vic-
timisation, a reduction in rates in both intervention and
control arms over the course of the study but a signiﬁcantly
greater reduction in the intervention group. We observed an
even greater impact on IPV victimisation among those with
higher rates of education session attendance, compared
with the control arm. The PREPARE trial is one of several
adolescent IPV prevention programmes with evidence of
beneﬁcial effects on reported IPV [22, 23]. However, to our
knowledge PREPARE is one of only two that have been
trialled among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. The
other trial conducted in this region of the world was
Stepping Stones, conducted out of school, among older
adolescents than those in the PREPARE trial [8]. The
PREPARE study is one of several trials with a combined
IPV/ HIV prevention focus [8, 24–26], but only PREPARE
and Stepping Stones [8] were conducted predominantly
among adolescents. PREPARE is the only one of these
combination IPV/HIV trials that failed to impact both IPV
and HIV risk (measured either by self-reported sexual risk
behaviour or STI/HIV infection).
Given that the participants of the PREPARE trial had
sub-optimal exposure to the PREPARE intervention com-
ponents, how did the programme achieve a beneﬁcial effect
on IPV? We speculate that the explanation is that partici-
pants were more likely to be exposed to the PREPARE IPV
intervention components than components focussing on
sexual risk behaviour. The after-school education sessions
were ordered so that the sessions addressing gender
inequities and gender power came before the sessions
addressing condom use, delaying sex and number of part-
ners. Attendance was higher at the earlier sessions [18],
and consequently more participants received exposure to
the intervention content related to IPV, than content related
to sexual risk behaviour. Furthermore, the school-level
intervention (the school safety programme), focussed on
reducing IPV and sexual violence and did not have any
direct focus on sexual risk reduction.
Limitations
Self-report measures are prone to bias and and biological
measures provide the most convincing evidence of effects.
The biological measure included in our trial (3 years
incidence of conceptions among female participants) will
only be available in 2016. Students who had signed par-
ental consent and therefore participated in the study might
not have been those most in need of interventions such as
PREPARE. Therefore we might not have reached those
who would beneﬁt most from the programme. Our analyses
of participants who attended more than one, or more than
ten PREPARE education sessions compared with the
control arm, are not based on an intention-to-treat analysis
and are therefore potentially undermined by selection bias.
We do not have the statistical power to perform gender-
stratiﬁed analyses for the primary outcomes.
Conclusions
Recent evidence shows adolescents are the only age group
in which AIDS-related mortality is increasing, while in all
other age groups it is decreasing [27]. Preventing new
infections among adolescents and young people is a key
goal in reaching the target of ending the AIDS epidemic by
2030. The PREPARE study aimed to prevent HIV among
adolescents by reducing sexual risk behaviours and IPV.
Despite adolescents’ low participation rate in the PRE-
PARE intervention, we observed a reduction in IPV, which
suggests the intervention shaped intimate partnerships into
more safe and appropriate ones. Thus, we have demon-
strated the potential of interventions such as PREPARE to
have a beneﬁcial effect on one of the factors which strongly
affect adolescents’ risk of STIs and HIV. Reducing IPV is
regarded as a critical goal for HIV prevention [28]. Women
exposed to IPV have limited ability to assert their choices
about sexuality [29] and are at a higher risk of incident HIV
infection [28, 30]. Reducing IPV is thus likely to lower risk
for HIV/STIs in the longer term.
The PREPARE intervention did not lead to any reduc-
tions in sexual risk behaviours related to HIV prevention,

despite that the intervention focussed on, and had a bene-
ﬁcial effect on one of the key structural barriers to HIV
prevention, gender violence. Young adolescents probably
need more intense, sustained exposure to interventions
such as PREPARE to have an impact on sexual risk
behaviour. With after-school programmes, it is difﬁcult to
achieve such exposure. However, we believe our ﬁndings
probably also imply that reducing HIV risk among ado-
lescents requires interventions which address a greater
range of structural, social and environmental barriers to
behaviours that prevent HIV infection.
