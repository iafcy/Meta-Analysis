Abstract
Background: Globally, sexual violence is prevalent, particularly for adolescent women. This cluster-randomized
controlled implementation trial examines empowerment self-defense (ESD) for sexual assault risk reduction among
school-age women in Malawi.
Methods: The unit of randomization and analysis was the school (n = 141). Intervention participants received a 12-h
intervention over 6 weeks, with refreshers. Primary outcomes were past-year prevalence and incident rate of sexual
violence. Secondary outcomes included confidence, self-defense knowledge, and, for those victimized, violence
disclosure. Interaction effects on outcomes were evaluated with Poisson models with school-correlated robust
variance estimates for risk ratios and incident rate ratios (baseline n = 6644, follow-up n = 4278).
Results: Past-year sexual assault prevalence was reduced among intervention students (risk ratio [RR] 0.68, 95% CI
0.56, 0.82), but not control students (interaction effect p < 0.001). Significant increases in self-defense knowledge were
observed solely among intervention students (RR 3.33, 95% CI 2.76, 4.02; interaction effect p < 0.001). Significant
changes in sexual violence prevalence and knowledge were observed for both primary and secondary students.
Favorable reductions were also observed in sexual violence incident rate among students overall (interaction effect
p = 0.01).
Conclusions: This intervention reduced sexual violence victimization in both primary and secondary school settings.
Results support the effectiveness of ESD to address sexual violence, and approach the elimination of violence against
women and girls set forth with Sustainable Development Goal #5. Implementation within the education system can
enable sustainability and reach.

Background
Gender-based violence (GBV), i.e., violence perpetrated
based on sex or gender identity [1], has been recognized
as a public health and human rights issue since 1993 [2].
Globally, an estimated one in three women experiences
physical or sexual violence [3]. Physical, sexual and
mental health morbidities resulting from gender-based
violence are well-characterized [4, 5] and include unin-
tended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection in-
cluding HIV. Adolescents are at high risk for GBV [6];
accordingly, research priorities for adolescent sexual and
reproductive health in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) highlight GBV prevention [7]. Adolescents’
young age and relative inexperience can constrain their
relationship power and incur risk, particularly with older
partners [8–11]. Violence can set young women on a
trajectory for future violence [12, 13] and sexual risk
behavior [14].
Malawi is a critical setting for preventing and respond-
ing to GBV, particularly sexual violence against young
women, for whom the prevention evidence lags behind.
Recent
national
data
from
Malawi
reveal
that
an
estimated one in five (21.8%) young adult women
experienced sexual abuse prior to age 18, primarily per-
petrated by boyfriends, classmates and acquaintances
[15]. Other nationally representative data estimate that
one in four (25%) sexually experienced women ages 15–
19 characterize their sexual debut as forced, well above
estimates pooled across all available data globally (15%)
and within the region (21%) [6]. For youth, gender-based
power disparities can be exacerbated by age-based power
disparities; for almost half of female childhood (< 18
years) sexual abuse victims, perpetrators were five or
more years older [15]. The health and development im-
pact of sexual violence is profound. As in other settings,
sexual violence against young women in Malawi is asso-
ciated with poor outcomes across domains of sexual and
reproductive
health
[16],
and
mental
health
[16].
Victimization can also undermine school enrollment and
progress [17], thus compromising women’s future en-
gagement in political, business and economic sectors.
These patterns play out against pervasive gender-based
violence and stark gender disparities within the nation.
An estimated 40% of ever-married women in Malawi
have experienced intimate partner violence in their
lifetimes,
with
past-year
abuse
affecting
30%
[18].
National data also confirm the dominance of husbands
in decision-making over household spending and access
to health care [18]. The 2014 Gender Inequality Index,
which
reflects
gender
inequalities
in
reproductive
health, empowerment and economic activity, ranked
Malawi at 140 out of 154 countries, largely reflecting
maternal mortality and adolescent fertility indicators
as well as gender-based educational disparities [19].
These structural-level factors and adolescents’ experi-
ences of sexual violence create an entrenched, mutu-
ally reinforcing cycle whereby tolerance of abuse, and
structural gender inequalities perpetuate sexual vio-
lence. Simultaneously, sustained violence undermines
gender equality through conveying the notion that
young women are not valued, and by curtailing their
engagement in education, employment and mobility
based on safety concerns [20, 21].
Addressing sexual violence in Malawi and other en-
demic settings requires responding to structural forces,
including social norms that tolerate sexual violence and
expect silence and isolation in response, particularly for
young women. Empowerment self-defense (ESD) is an
interactive training experience that prepares participants
for mental, verbal and physical self-defense through bol-
stering verbal and physical safety skills, and imparts the
self-confidence to implement them. Safety promotion
can reduce danger, and shift power away from potential
abusers. Moreover, through preparation and practice,
participants cultivate use of their voice and personal
power in a striking contrast to social expectations of
silence and compliance that enable continued violence
perpetration with impunity. ESD provides active tools for
resistance, thus responding to structural forces that dis-
empower young women, blame them for victimization
and undermine safety.
While a comprehensive approach to sexual violence
prevention necessarily entails addressing perpetration,
there remains a sustained need to assist women in resist-
ing sexual violence, particularly in high-prevalence con-
texts such as Malawi. As leading scholars articulate,
such risk reduction interventions can and must be
implemented in a way that does not blame victims for
their experiences,
but rather strengthens resistance to
victim-blaming for such experiences [22]. Recent reviews
suggest ESD is a promising yet underutilized strategy for
violence risk reduction, though discourse and evaluation
to date has primarily focused on college and university
campuses, predominantly in higher income contexts [22,
23]. In college and university settings, sexual violence in-
terventions that
incorporate
self-defense
have been
shown to reduce sexual assault [24] including both com-
pleted and attempted rape [25]. These reductions in vio-
lence
may
reflect
the
increases
observed
in
both
confidence in resisting sexual violence [24, 26] and be-
havioral strategies for self-protection [26]. ESD has had
limited uptake in LMIC settings; one notable exception
is its implementation and evaluation in the densely pop-
ulated urban communities of Nairobi, Kenya, where it
was found to reduce sexual assault incidence among
young
women
[27,
28],
and
also
buffered
against
pregnancy-related school dropout, suggesting a cascade
impact on health and well-being [29].

This study sought to determine the effect of a stan-
dardized 6-week ESD program (IMPower) on sexual
violence
outcomes
among
primary
and
secondary
school girls in three distinct districts of Malawi, rela-
tive to a control condition who received life-skills
training. We also explore impact on proximal out-
comes including self-defense knowledge, and confi-
dence/ self-efficacy, and disclosure of violence. This
cluster-randomized
implementation
trial
was
con-
ducted in the context of the expansion of IMpower
into
Malawi
schools
through
the
UNICEF
Safe
Schools Initiative. It extends the limited knowledge
base on ESD in LMICs, and explores its value in
more diffuse and heterogeneous settings.
Methods
Setting, recruitment and data collection
This study was implemented in the Malawi districts of
Lilongwe, Dedza, and Salima, selected for heterogeneity
and based on designation as priority, high-need settings
for UNICEF’s Safe Schools Program. Lilongwe, the cap-
ital, is the most urbanized site. Dedza lies south of
Lilongwe, in the mountains on the Mozambique border.
Salima is located on the lake. Within districts, primary
and
secondary
schools
were
selected
for
stratified
randomization from a full listing of schools participating
in UNICEF’s Safe Schools program by UNICEF’s field as-
sessment team.
Within each selected school, research staff drew a sim-
ple random sample of students for activity participation
(intervention or control) with the goal of a 20:1 student
to instructor ratio. Based on instructor capacity in
Lilongwe and Dedza, approximately 60 female students
were selected for activity participation per school; in Sal-
ima where more staff were available, approximately 100
female students were selected per school. In most set-
tings, participating classes included primary school clas-
ses 5, 6, 7, 8 and secondary school forms 1, 2, 3, 4. In
Salima, Class 8 was not included in the selection pool
based on retention concerns as many Class 8 students
graduate. Sessions took place after school and were split
as necessary for larger groups. Students within partici-
pating schools were blinded to intervention or control
status. Within schools, simple random sampling was
achieved by gathering participating school classes out-
side for circulation of an opaque plastic tin contain-
ing a pre-determined mix of beads specific to the size
of each school. Students each selected a single bead;
bead color red indicated random selection into the
activities (intervention or control) underway at their
school.
In
several
schools,
administrator
concerns
emerged regarding the use of red beads for random
selection, and black instructor uniforms, which led to
color modification for these procedures.
Study population and retention
Baseline data was collected from February to June 2015
(See Fig. 1). Sample size was determined on the basis of
implementation capacity. Follow-up data collection oc-
curred from November 2015–May 2016. Follow-up data
collection was not attempted in ten schools (5 Lilongwe,
4 Dedza, 1 Salima) based on the aforementioned admin-
istrator concerns; additionally students in Class 8 and
Form 4 were not followed after completing school exam-
inations; yielding an effective baseline sample of 6644
students. Follow-up data was obtained for 3311 primary
school students and 967 secondary school students (total
n = 4278).
IMPower intervention activities
IMPower consists of weekly, 2-h sessions for 6 weeks for
a total of 12 h of interactive, empowerment self-defense
training. Because physical interventions can escalate sit-
uations of potential violence, IMPower emphasizes early
recognition of boundary testing, negotiation, diffusion
and distraction tactics, and verbal assertiveness over
physical self-defense, with the guidance that physical tac-
tics should only be used if they are the last and best op-
tion.
IMpower
teaches
boundary
recognition
and
boundary setting (e.g., name harmful behaviors, warn
about consequences), negotiation and diffusion tactics,
verbal assertiveness (e.g., yell if threatened), and physical
defense skills, with the self-efficacy to implement these
skills. The physical skills comprise closed target skills,
weapons and targets. After the six weeks, two-hour re-
fresher
courses
are
performed
every
3–6 months.
IMPower was developed by No Means No Worldwide
(NMNW), a US-based NGO. An extensive formative
phase was conducted to adapt IMPower for the Malawi
context. Following community sensitization and struc-
tured discussions with key stakeholders, program ad-
aptations
included
an
emphasis
on
verbal
and
negotiation skills, with clarification that a physical re-
sponse, including physical self-defense, is a last resort
in a situation of danger. IMPower instructors are
carefully selected with preference for experience with
youth and on issues of GBV, and capacity for teach-
ing and community organizing. All instructors attend
a 3-week, 126-h intensive training in Lilongwe. After
certification, instructors are deployed, most often to
their
home
districts,
for
a
6-month
period
of
co-teaching with an experienced instructor, followed
by independent teaching.
Control condition activities
Students randomized to the control condition received
the standard of care for youth in schools, specifically the
Lifeskills program. This standard 2-h Malawian school
program
covers
adolescent
health
topics
including

puberty, menstruation, hygiene, sex education, STIs/
HIV, and pregnancy prevention. These students also re-
ceived two-hour refresher classes at 3–6 months also fo-
cused on puberty and hygiene at 10.5 months, prior to
completing follow-up surveys.
Supporting sexual violence survivors: The SASA program
IMPower participants who disclosed sexual violence dur-
ing the program were referred to the Sexual Assault Sur-
vivors
Anonymous
(SASA)
support
program.
This
voluntary program offers weekly meetings with the goal
of healing. From the IMPower program, 56 students in
Lilongwe, 46 in Dedza, and 70 in Salima, were voluntar-
ily linked to SASA support services.
Randomization
The unit of randomization was the school, to minimize
risk of contamination given the intensity of the IMPower
intervention. Within district, primary and secondary
schools were grouped into blocks based on approximate
size, and randomized within block to intervention or
control conditions using SPSS (allocation ratio 1:1). Par-
ticipants were assigned to intervention or control condi-
tion based on school. For logistical purposes regarding
planning program duration, school administrators were
aware of assignment to intervention condition prior to
study implementation. While every effort was made to
blind students and teachers to intervention arm, inter-
vention status could have been inadvertently been re-
vealed to teachers or students.
Data collection procedures
Informed consent followed UNICEF guidelines. Teacher
consent was undergone during the formative phase to
allow classroom participation of students. Written con-
sent was obtained from parents and students prior to
participation in the program and evaluation research.
Data collection procedures were designed to maximize
confidentiality, in accordance with best practices for
violence-related research [30]. No names or identifiers
were collected. Participants self-administered baseline
and follow-up surveys, aided by two instructors present
in each class: one for reading the measures aloud and
the other for monitoring the class to ensure confidenti-
ality. Each question and answer choice was read aloud to
the entire class in both English and Chichewa. Instruc-
tors from the local district were present to ensure that
the district-specific dialect of Chichewa was used for
survey administration, as terms vary by district. The stu-
dents were given the opportunity to ask questions before

Decker et al. BMC Public Health         (2018) 18:1341 
Page 4 of 12

selecting their own answer choice. To minimize deduct-
ive disclosure related to speed of survey completion, a
response was required for each question, including
“never had sex” or “never experienced sexual violence.”
To maximize confidentiality, following survey comple-
tion, participants deposited their survey in a locked bal-
lot box [31] to be taken directly to the research office,
thus limiting the risk of instructors or data collectors in-
advertently viewing responses. Students in both study
arms had the option to self-refer to study staff and/or
teachers for violence-related support and connection to
local services.
Measures
All measures were self-reported. They were adapted
from prior evaluations of the IMPower program in
Kenya [27, 28, 32] for comparability, and piloted in
Malawian primary and secondary schools and with
Chichewa-speaking instructor groups for feasibility and
acceptability.
Survey
instruments
were
designed
to
maximize efficiency and feasibility for this demonstra-
tion study, as well as confidentiality. Primary outcomes
were past year prevalence and past year incident rate of
forced sex; for comparability with past evaluations. The
forced sex outcome was assessed with a single item used
for Kenya-based evaluations of IMPower [27, 28, 32],
specifically, “Since you took the No Means No survey or
in the past one year, have you ever been forced against
your will to have sex (penetration of your vagina, anus
or mouth with a man’s penis or another object)?” with a
follow-up question “If so, how many times?”. School-
level prevalence reflects the total number of participants
who reported any forced sex over the referent period, di-
vided by the total number of participants in the school.
Incident rate was computed as mean number of forced
sexual incidents per person-time within school, con-
verted to adjust for time frame differences between the
baseline
(12 months)
and
follow-up
period
(10.5
months). Prevalence and disclosure outcomes are pre-
sented as proportions for interpretability; statistical in-
ferences
were
robust
in
sensitivity
analysis
with
time-adjusted estimates (data not shown).
Intermediate outcomes were confidence, knowledge,
and sexual violence disclosure. Confidence measures
were developed specifically for IMPower, specifically, “If
I am attacked by a bigger man I feel confident that I can
defend myself” and “Is it okay to use force and even in-
jure anyone who is known to me if he is forcing me to
have sex and will not listen to me (e.g., brother, boy-
friend, father, cousin)?” Knowledge pertained to the
self-defense skills taught, specifically: “If I am grabbed by
an attacker what should I use to free myself?” and “The
main aim of self-defense is to?” Both confidence and
knowledge
were
then
transformed
into
scores—if
students answered both questions correctly, they were
considered to have “complete” knowledge or “high” con-
fidence, respectively, with those answering only one or
zero serving as the referent group. Disclosure of sexual
violence was measured among girls who had experi-
enced violence in the past year/since the baseline survey
from the question “Did you tell anyone about it?” and
analyzed
dichotomously.
Participants
with
past-year
forced sex were asked to indicate perpetrator(s), which
were aggregated into the following groups: boyfriend,
friend, relative (including stepfather/father and brother),
neighbor, known adult (comprising teacher, pastor, po-
lice, doctor, and imam), stranger (including gangster),
and other perpetrator. Formative research documented
presence of Chinamwali, a Malawian rite of passage that
can include forced sex, undergone by adolescent girls at
the start of puberty. Chinamwali experiences were
assessed via “In some communities in Malawi girls at-
tend/undergo chinamwali. Have you gone through chi-
namwali?” These items were the only measures unique
to Malawi.
Analysis
Data were entered by a single individual and independ-
ently reviewed for accuracy by a second individual. The
unit of analysis is the school level. We attempted an-
onymous matching of baseline and follow-up surveys for
individual-level
statistical
analysis;
participants
self-created an identification code based on responses to
questions for which only they would know the answer.
The elements of the self-created identification codes
proved suboptimal; for example, participants had limited
knowledge regarding month and year of birth, and
matching across time periods was poor. Individual-level
baseline characteristics of participants by school type
and intervention arm were compared using chi-squared
statistics. Subsequent matching analyses and compari-
sons across time points were all done at the school-level
given the suboptimal matching of individual-level data.
To support aggregate analysis at the school level, base-
line and follow-up data points were collapsed at the
school level to obtain means and counts. The primary
and intermediate endpoints included past-year sexual
violence prevalence, past-year sexual violence incident
rate (primary), disclosure of abuse, self-defense know-
ledge, and confidence (intermediate). Poisson regression
with cluster-correlated robust variance estimates was
used to estimate either risk ratios or incident rate ratios
per student-month comparing intervention arms by time
point. The model included arm, time point (baseline vs.
endline), and time-arm interaction to test within-arm
baseline to endline relative change. School size (or a
product of school size by time period) was used as an
offset term in the Poisson regression to constrain the

coefficient to one and use it as the denominator for the
risk and rates. Results were subsequently stratified by
type of school (primary/secondary) and district. Add-
itionally, perpetrator groups were compared between
baseline and follow-up; p-values were estimated using
generalized linear models with binomial distribution and
logit link and school-correlated variance, using each type
of perpetrator as the outcome. The sample size fluctu-
ates slightly to accommodate small amounts of missing
data.
All statistical analyses were conducted in STATA
14 (STATCORP. College Station, TX).
All procedures were approved by the Malawi National
Commission for Science and Technology (Ref. No.
NCST/RTT/2/6). Johns Hopkins conducted post-hoc
evaluation analysis with support from UNICEF, and
received a non-human subject IRB determination given
the anonymous nature of data. This trial was registered
with
Pan
African
Clinical
Trials
Registry
(PACTR
201702002028911) in February 2017; trial registry did
not occur in advance of participant enrollment due to
ambiguity on eligibility for trial registry given the applied
(rather than clinical) nature of the study. Resource con-
straints prevented data collection on the pregnancy-related
school dropouts initially proposed within the protocol as
well as implementation of the companion programming for
young men; thus the current analysis reports solely on sex-
ual assault outcomes. The intervention promotes boundary
setting through voice and action, with physical self-defense
as a last resort. There are possible harms that could result
from self-defense, including injury. No adverse events have
been reported in past trials [27, 32] of this intervention. For
this implementation trial, study staff were directed to im-
mediately report any adverse events to the Ujamaa office;
no adverse events were detected.

primary school students was 15.28 (SD = 2.06) and
mean age of secondary school students was 19.55
(SD = 2.70). Salima district comprised approximately
50% of primary school students, whereas approxi-
mately 70% of secondary school students were from
Lilongwe. Sixteen percent of primary school girls and
26% of secondary school girls had ever been forced to
have sex. Prevalence of previous year forced sex was
slightly lower than ever forced, with 10% of primary
school girls and 18% of secondary school girls report-
ing forced sex victimization in the past year. Of girls
who reported forced sex experiences at baseline, 49%
of primary school girls reported only one incident
within the past year, whereas 63% of secondary school
girls reported multiple incidents.
Primary outcomes
Across all students, baseline past-year sexual violence
was prevalent in both intervention (15.2%) and control
arms (13.8%; Table 2). By follow-up, prevalence in the
intervention arm dropped to 9.2%(Risk Ratio(RR)Interven-
tion 0.59 [95% CI 0.49–0.72]), while control arm preva-
lence
remained
approximately
steady
at
14.5%
(RRControl1.04[0.86–1.26]); interaction effect p-value <
0.001. Overall incident rates followed a similar trend;
they
were
comparable
at
baseline
(19.6
per
1000

cantly by follow-up in the intervention arm (16.3; Rate
RatioIntervention = 0.82 [0.67–1.00]), and increased in the
control arm (24.0; Rate RatioControl = 1.22[0.95–1.57].The
overall interaction effect favored the intervention arm
(p-value =0.01).
Secondary outcomes
Substantial differences in baseline self-defense confi-
dence were seen across intervention and control groups
(full confidence 41.2% vs. 26.2%, p < 0.001). Modest in-
creases in confidence were observed for both inter-
vention
(RR = 1.33
[1.17–1.50])
and
control
(RR =
1.26[1.06–1.49]) groups; the interaction effect was not
significant (p = 0.63). While baseline self-defense know-
ledge was slightly higher for the intervention than con-
trol group (full knowledge 15.0% vs. 7.0%, p < 0.001),

effect
p-value < 0.001.Among those who experienced sexual
violence in the past year, violence disclosure increased in
both intervention and control groups
(Intervention
73.0% vs 83.7%; RRIntervention = 1.14 [1.04–1.26], p =
0.007; Control 68.2% vs. 74.8%; RRControl = 1.10 [1.01–
1.19], p = 0.02; resulting in an insignificant interaction
effect (p = 0.50).
Stratification by primary vs. secondary school and district
In primary schools, past-year sexual violence prevalence
decreased significantly in the intervention arm (baseline
13.0% vs. follow-up 7.5%; RRIntervention 0.58 [95% CI
0.45–0.74]), and remained steady in the control arm
(12.1% vs. 11.8%; RRControl 0.97 [95% CI 0.78–1.20]); inter-
vention effect p-value = 0.002. In primary schools, differ-
ences
in
sexual
violence
incident
rates
were
not
statistically significant, but in the direction of a decrease
in the intervention arm and an increase in the control
arm (Rate RatioIntervention = 0.88[0.71–1.11]; Rate RatioCon-
trol = 1.20[0.88–1.62]; overall interaction effect p-value =
0.12. Significant interaction effects were observed for
self-defense knowledge (p < 0.001), while confidence and
disclosure increased for both intervention and control
arms with nonsignificant intervention interaction effects.
In secondary schools, where past-year sexual violence
was most prevalent at baseline (22.7% intervention, 20.1%
control), prevalence similarly decreased significantly in the
intervention
arm
(RRintervention = 0.70[0.54–0.91])
and
remained unchanged in the control arm (RRcontrol =
1.13[0.78–1.67]); intervention effect p-value = 0.04). Dif-
ferences in sexual violence incident rates were not statisti-
cally significant, though trended towards a reduction in
intervention schools and an increase in control schools
(Rate RatioIntervention = 0.82[0.56–1.19]; Rate RatioControl =
1.23[0.78–1.94]; overall interaction effect p-value = 0.18.
Similar to primary schools, an interaction effect was ob-
served for self-defense knowledge (p = 0.02), whereas con-
fidence and disclosure increased for both arms with
nonsignificant intervention interaction effects.
In district-stratified analysis (data not shown), signifi-
cant interaction effects (p < 0.05) were observed for sex-
ual violence prevalence in Lilongwe and Salima districts.
In Dedza, intervention impact was concentrated among
secondary students (interaction effect p = 0.03). The lack
of significant effect observed for primary students in
Dedza may reflect statistical power issues stemming
from the low baseline prevalence of sexual violence
among Dedza primary students (8.3% intervention arm;
11.5%
control
arm),
coupled
with
their
somewhat
smaller overall sample size.
Perpetrator mix
Overall, across intervention arms, time periods, and
school levels, most sexual violence perpetrators were
known to victims (Table 3). Boyfriends were the most
common perpetrators for primary (34.5–45.4%) and sec-
ondary students (41.0–68.6%) across both intervention
and control groups, followed by relatives, friends and
neighbors. Only 9–15% of primary students affected by
violence indicated strangers as perpetrators; < 1–9.5%
among secondary students. Amongst the intervention
group, the proportion of sexual assaults perpetrated by

relatives decreased significantly from 21.0% at baseline
to 9.8% at follow-up (p = 0.01). Perpetration by boy-
friends, other known adults, and strangers held steady.
Several changes in the control group were also noted
during this time, including decreases in the proportion
of assaults perpetrated by neighbors among those vic-
timized. When stratified by school level, the decrease in
relative-perpetrated violence was found concentrated
among primary school students in the intervention arm
(26.0 to 8.9%, p = 0.001). Among secondary school inter-
vention arm students, there were no significant changes
in sexual violence perpetrators, however in the control
arm, a higher proportion of relatives and strangers were
indicated as violence perpetrators at follow-up, while the
proportion of boyfriends as perpetrators decreased from
baseline to follow-up (68.6 to 41.0%; p = 0.004).
Skills mix
Within the intervention group, 43% of girls said that
they had used skills to stop forced sex since IMPower
ESD training. Of the girls that used the skills, 49% used
verbal only, 13% used physical only, and 38% used a
combination of verbal and physical skills. Of those, 52%
reported using the learned skills more than once to stop
forced sex. The skills learned within IMPower extended
beyond sexual violence prevention, with an additional
53% of girls reporting using the skills to stop harassment
and 52% reporting using the skills to stop physical vio-
lence since the ESD training (data not shown).
Disclosure
Those who disclosed sexual violence were most likely to
turn to friends (approximately 50% at both baseline and

follow up), with fewer than 7% reporting to law enforce-
ment (data not shown). While approximately 80% of girls
disclosed their violence experience to someone, they chose
to disclose to friends and other members of their informal
networks, instead of police or medical professionals.
Discussion
Results from this cluster-randomized controlled imple-
mentation
trial
support
the
effectiveness
of
school-based, empowerment self-defense training as a
promising strategy in reducing risk for sexual violence
for girls in both primary and secondary schools in
Malawi. Compared with control participants, students
assigned to IMPower intervention reported reductions
in past-year sexual violence from baseline to follow-up,
and
increases
in
self-defense-related
knowledge.
IMpower has been previously found effective in reducing
sexual violence in the densely-populated urban settle-
ments of Nairobi, Kenya [27, 28]; current findings pro-
vide a critical replication and extension of this work by
demonstrating similar reductions in sexual assault preva-
lence, as well as increases in knowledge in self-defense,
in the far more diffuse setting of Malawi (197.5 people/
kmsq; 2017) [33],across a heterogeneity of districts, and
across both primary and secondary school levels. Results
provide timely direction for addressing the epidemic of
sexual violence against young women in Malawi, where
an estimated one in four young women experience sex-
ual violence by the time of secondary school.
Several potential mechanisms may underlie the reduc-
tions observed in sexual violence among ESD participa-
tion in this study, and in past evaluations [27, 28, 32].
The observed increases in self-defense knowledge in the
intervention arm relative to controls, may in part explain
the reductions in sexual violence. Empowerment and so-
cial cognitive theory would suggest knowledge as neces-
sary but insufficient to change in health-related behavior,
and would suggest power, self-efficacy, or confidence as
necessary to implement change. Surprisingly, confidence
in responding to threatening situations increased in both
intervention and control arms with no significant inter-
vention effect observed. It is possible that our current
measures, while tailored to IMpower content, were in-
sufficiently sensitive to capture meaningful changes in
confidence and empowerment resulting from the pro-
gram. It is also possible that natural maturation is re-
sponsible for the observed increases in confidence across
both arms. Our findings should be interpreted with cau-
tion
given
measurement
limitations
in
assessing
self-confidence (2 items), particularly given recent evi-
dence
from
Nairobi,
which
showed
increases
in
self-efficacy as assessed on a generalized scale, when
IMpower was implemented in concert with program-
ming for young men [32]. Finally, it is possible that
IMpower shifted participants’ interpersonal power in
ways that were perceived by potential sexual violence
perpetrators and changed their behavior. Evaluating this
mechanism would require community-level research, in
addition to the participant data that has served as the
basis for this and related studies.
The vast majority of sexual violence perpetrators were
known to victims, with boyfriends the most commonly
reported perpetrators at baseline and follow-up, across
primary and secondary schools and intervention and
control groups. Results are consistent with past research
in Malawi and globally indicating boyfriends, intimate
partners and other acquaintances as leading perpetrators
of violence against women [15, 34]. In the control arm,
among secondary students, proportion of violence survi-
vors reporting boyfriends as perpetrators decreased
while proportion of survivors reporting relatives as per-
petrators increased by follow-up. Intervention arm pri-
mary
schools
saw
decreases
in
the
proportion
of
survivor reporting relatives as perpetrators by follow-up.
Further research, including qualitative inquiry, can help
inform the ways in which this intervention may function
differentially for different types of perpetrators. Differ-
ences observed in perpetrator mix at baseline and
follow-up, however results should be interpreted with
caution in that they represent the portion of survivors
reporting a given perpetrator type rather than prevalence
or incidents by perpetrator.
Results should be considered in light of several add-
itional limitations. As in past evaluations of this program
[27, 28, 32], the inability to link individual surveys across
baseline and follow-up constrains evaluation of mecha-
nisms responsible for changes observed, and discern-
ment of primary prevention (preventing new incidents
among unaffected individuals) vs secondary prevention
(reducing recurrent exposure among those who have ex-
perienced sexual violence). The evaluation’s emphasis on
efficient survey data collection for this demonstration
project prompted some measurement limitations. Most
notably, we lack data on demographic characteristics
that could be used to explore effects by specific group-
ings. Sexual violence assessment was limited to forced
sex,
which
offers
specificity
yet
overlooks
non-consensual sexual experiences resulting from coer-
cion, threats or pressure that did not rise to the level of
physical force, and thus may underestimate the extent of
sexual violence. Future research should also explore
intervention effects on sexual harassment and
physical
and emotional abuse, which were not assessed for time
considerations. The relatively short follow-up duration
limits our ability to understand the durability of findings.
The self-reported nature of data, single-blind design with
students, but not school or study staff, blind to interven-
tion assignment, and instructor-led survey administration
Decker et al. BMC Public Health         (2018) 18:1341 
Page 10 of 12

could introduce error or bias, despite the measures in
place to enhance confidentiality and comfort. Our use of a
past-year prevalence outcome for sexual violence is a limi-
tation in precision for follow-up estimates given the 10.5
month length to follow-up; this imprecision is evenly dis-
tributed across intervention and control arms and is not
likely to introduce bias. Statistical inferences were consist-
ent in sensitivity analysis converted to adjust for time dif-
ference.
While
the
IMpower
program
targets
girls
specifically, we note that sexual violence also affects young
men [15]. Finally we note that while IMPower is designed
to increase skills, confidence, and safety behavior in
responding to sexual violence and potentially threatening
situations, the ultimate behavioral responsibility for sexual
violence prevention rests with perpetrators, not victims, of
violence.
Conclusions
Our study adds to a limited evidence base on sexual vio-
lence prevention interventions that are effective across a
diversity of settings, and address the needs of younger
girls in particular. It is worth noting that this interven-
tion has now been piloted and evaluated in two African
countries, Kenya and Malawi, demonstrating efficacy
across a diversity of cultural and social systems.
Results support the effectiveness of ESD to address
sexual violence in this high prevalence setting. ESD may
aid Malawi and other signatory nations in meeting the
obligations set forth by the Convention on the Elimin-
ation of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women
(CEDAW), and approach the goal of elimination of vio-
lence against women and girls set forth with Sustainable
Development Goal #5. Implementation within the edu-
cation system can enable sustainability and reach.
