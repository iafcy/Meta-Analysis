Objectives. To examine the impacts of a government-implemented cash plus program on violence
experiences and perpetration among Tanzanian adolescents.
Methods. We used data from a cluster randomized controlled trial (n 5 130 communities) conducted in
the Mbeya and Iringa regions of Tanzania to isolate impacts of the “plus” components of the cash plus
intervention. The panel sample comprised 904 adolescents aged 14 to 19 years living in households
receiving a government cash transfer. We estimated intent-to-treat impacts on violence experiences,
violence perpetration, and pathways of impact.
Results. The plus intervention reduced female participants’ experiences of sexual violence by 5
percentage points and male participants’ perpetration of physical violence by 6 percentage points. There
were no intervention impacts on emotional violence, physical violence, or help seeking. Examining
pathways, we found positive impacts on self-esteem and participation in livestock tending and, among
female participants, a positive impact on sexual debut delays and a negative effect on school
attendance.
Conclusions. By addressing poverty and multidimensional vulnerability, integrated social protection can
reduce violence.
Public Health Implications. There is high potential for scale-up and sustainability, and this program
reaches some of the most vulnerable and marginalized adolescents. (Am J Public Health. 2021;111(12):
2227–2238. https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306509)

experiences and witnessing of violence
in childhood increase the risk of
experiencing and perpetrating violence
in adulthood.5,6
A consortium of international agen-
cies developed INSPIRE, a set of
strategies to reduce violence against
children (VAC); strategies include
income and economic strengthening
(such as cash transfers) and life and
social skills training.7
Poverty is a structural driver of vio-
lence, and there are several pathways
through which economic-strengthening
programs such as “cash plus,” deﬁned
as a combination of cash transfers with
additional complementary support or
linkages to services,8 may reduce the
risk of childhood violence. “Cash plus”
may also imact food security, ﬁnancial
empowerment and bargaining power,
changes in time use activities (including
schooling, labor, and domestic chores),
caregiving behaviors, psychosocial well-
being, child marriage, and time spent in
high-risk settings.9,10
More evidence is still needed on VAC
reduction interventions involving men
and boys and around economic
empowerment.3,11,12 A review of

noncontributory social safety net pro-
grams, including cash transfers, found
that social safety nets can contribute to
VAC reduction.10 More recently, studies
from Mali and Zimbabwe have demon-
strated that household-targeted cash
plus programs reduced violence expe-
rienced by children and youths.13,14
Violence impacts have also been
examined in bundled interventions
targeted to adolescents comprising
components related to economic
strengthening, life skills, and strength-
ening health capabilities, but the
evidence is mixed. Interventions in sub-
Saharan Africa show reductions in
forced sex in Uganda (Livelihood
Empowerment for Adolescents), physi-
cal or sexual violence in Zimbabwe
(Shaping the Health of Adolescents in
Zimbabwe) and Kenya (Adolescent Girls
Initiative), and reduced participation in
transactional sex in Zambia (Adolescent
Girls Empowerment Program).15–18
Nevertheless, in Zambia, the Adoles-
cent Girls Empowerment Program
found no impacts on physical violence,
intimate partner violence, or “unwanted
sex,” and an intervention implemented
in Kampala, Uganda, found that provid-
ing girls with a savings account but no
other life skills training increased the
risk of unwanted sexual touching and
harassment.15,19 When replicated in
Tanzania, the Livelihood Empowerment
for Adolescents intervention failed to
demonstrate protective impacts,20
while another intervention in Liberia
(Girl Empower) did not lead to reduc-
tions in violence.21
The aforementioned interventions
were implemented by nongovernmen-
tal organizations, and, thus, evidence is
needed on government-implemented
programs, which have greater potential
for sustainability and scale-up. Recent
studies have called for additional
research of at-scale programs to pre-
vent violence within households, as well
as programs tailored to reach adoles-
cent girls.22,23 We examined impacts of
the “plus” components from a
government-run, multisectoral cash
plus intervention on male and female
adolescents’ experiences and perpetra-
tion of violence.
METHODS
We used data from a longitudinal clus-
ter randomized controlled trial (n 5 130
communities), which was implemented
by United Nations Children’s Fund (UNI-
CEF) Ofﬁce of Research–Innocenti,
University at Buffalo, and EDI Global, in
collaboration with Tanzania Social
Action Fund (TASAF), Tanzania Commis-
sion for AIDS, and UNICEF Tanzania.
Participants
The cash plus intervention was piloted
in 4 districts and targeted adolescents
aged 14 to 19 years living in house-
holds participating in the Government
of the Republic of Tanzania’s ﬂagship
social protection program, the Produc-
tive Social Safety Net (PSSN). The PSSN
reaches 1 million households nation-
ally, providing a cash transfer every
other month, livelihoods enhancement,
and public works.24 Cash transfer pay-
ments were variable depending on
school enrollment and health-related
coresponsibilities, but these averaged
US $7.10 per month (maximum
US $21.70 per month), equivalent to
approximately 16% of household con-
sumption.24,25 All study households
(intervention and control arms) had
been enrolled in the PSSN since 2015
and received cash transfers. The inter-
vention that was randomized was the
“plus” components targeted to
adolescents. We used a sample size cal-
culation to determine the number of
clusters required (Appendix A, available
as a supplement to the online version
of this article at http://www.ajph.org).
Randomization
Random assignment of 130 villages
into study arms (65 intervention and 65
control) was conducted in July 2017,
after completion of the baseline sur-
veys, and was stratiﬁed by TASAF
administrative areas (program adminis-
trative areas, corresponding to Maﬁnga
and Muﬁndi districts in Iringa, and Run-
gwe and Busokelo districts in Mbeya)
and village size (large vs small villages).
Procedures
The “Ujana Salama” Cash Plus Model
for Safe Transitions to a Healthy and
Productive Adulthood intervention fol-
lowed a capabilities approach26,27 to
strengthen youth productive, human,
and health assets (Conceptual Frame-
work in Appendix B, available as a sup-
plement to the online version of this
article at http://www.ajph.org). Guiding
principles included government owner-
ship, implementation within the PSSN
livelihoods enhancement strategy and
existing government frameworks, link-
ages with other government services,
and age- and gender-sensitive liveli-
hoods interventions.
The intervention comprised (1) face-
to-face livelihoods and life skills training
delivered 2 hours per week over 12
weeks (January–May 2018); (2) mentor-
ing (occurring biweekly and then
monthly between July 2018 and March
2019) and a productive grant (totaling
US $80 disbursed in up to 2 payments
between March and June 2019), condi-
tional on having attended trainings and

developing an approved educational or
business plan; and (3) facilitated link-
ages to adolescent-friendly HIV and
sexual and reproductive health services
in government health facilities (July
2018–March 2019; Appendix C, avail-
able as a supplement to the online ver-
sion of this article at http://www.ajph.
org).
The training included sessions on
livelihoods, sexual and reproductive
health, and HIV prevention and treat-
ment, including a bundle of high-impact
behavior change communication
approaches and peer support groups
(topics summarized in Appendix C).
During mentoring, adolescents were
provided with linkages to training and
apprenticeship activities, input on busi-
ness plans, peer education, and link-
ages to health facilities (Activities in
Appendix D, available as a supplement
to the online version of this article at
http://www.ajph.org). Two mentors
(1 male, 1 female) were selected per vil-
lage. Addressing supply of health serv-
ices, UNICEF worked with the Ministry
of Health, Community Development,
Gender, Elderly, and Children to per-
form a training in July 2019 with staff at
government primary health care facili-
ties in treatment villages to strengthen
adolescent-friendly services.
We used TASAF administrative data
on PSSN enrollment (in 2015) to iden-
tify households that would have adoles-
cents aged 14 to 19 years in 2017. We
approached all of these households
and aimed to interview all eligible
youths (including new youths not regis-
tered in the household in 2015; Appen-
dix F, available as a supplement to the
online version of this article at http://
www.ajph.org). Three rounds of data
were collected: baseline (April–June
2017), round 2 (May–July 2018), and
round 3 (June–August 2019). We used
a split sample approach for modules
on violence victimization and perpetra-
tion for male and female participants
based on best practices guidance, in
which male participants answered the
violence module in one community and
female participants in another, to pro-
tect conﬁdentiality of participants and
reduce the chance that a perpetrator–-
victim pair would both be inter-
viewed.28 We provided anonymized
referral information to respondents
containing contact numbers for district
social welfare ofﬁcers.29
Interviews were conducted in Swahili
with same-sex enumerators in private
settings and data were entered into
SurveyBe version 5.10.210 (EDI Global
Limited, Gerrards Cross, UK) software
via tablets.
Measures
The primary outcomes were experi-
enced violence (emotional, physical,
sexual), help-seeking related to vio-
lence, and perpetration of physical and
emotional violence in the past 12
months. We assessed these by using
an adapted version of questionnaire
items used in the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) Multi-country Study on
Women’s Health and Domestic Vio-
lence,30 which draws on the Conﬂict
Tactics Scale.31 We adapted these
items to include any perpetrator (not
just intimate partners) for the current
study. Binary violence indicators for
emotional, physical, and sexual violence
were created from multiple items per
violence type (Appendix E, available as
a supplement to the online version of
this article at http://www.ajph.org). At
baseline, because of an error in a data-
entry skip pattern, sexual violence
questions were only asked of individu-
als who reported ever having had sex.
In subsequent rounds, sexual violence
questions were asked to all individuals
selected for the violence module.
Respondents experiencing any type
of violence were then asked whether
they had ever tried to seek help or tell
anyone about the violence. In line with
existing literature,32,33 we further cate-
gorized help seeking into formal and
informal sources (Appendix E).
We added questions on violence per-
petration at round 3. Binary perpetra-
tion indicators were created separately
for 12-month emotional and physical
violence based on items summarized in
Appendix D.
Intermediate pathways examined
included age at ﬁrst sexual intercourse,
entry into marriage or cohabitation,
engaging in an age-disparate sexual
relationship, self-perceived stress,
self-efﬁcacy, self-esteem, school atten-
dance, and time use (Appendix E).
Age-disparate sexual relationship was
deﬁned as having a sexual partner 5 or
more years older, in line with previous
studies.34 Self-perceived stress was
measured using the Enhanced Life Dis-
tress Inventory, which measures dis-
tress across multiple areas of social life
and functioning35 and results in an
overall scale ranging from 0 to 39 and 3
subscales (economic and health-
related well-being, risk and security,
relationships). We measured self-
efﬁcacy by using a locus-of-control
index36,37 and self-esteem by using 2
items from Rosenberg’s self-esteem
scale.38 For time use, we examined par-
ticipation in 5 types of economic activi-
ties performed in the past 7 days (farm
work, livestock herding, ﬁshing, nonagri-
cultural business, paid work outside the
household) and household chores per-
formed in the previous day (collecting
water; collecting ﬁrewood or other fuel
materials; collecting nuts or other tree

fruits; taking care of children, cooking,
or cleaning; and taking care of the
elderly or sick household members).
Activities were not mutually exclusive,
and multitasking was reported as sepa-
rate activities. An additional pathway
examined elsewhere was gender-
equitable attitudes.39
Statistical Analysis
As policymakers are interested in
understanding population impacts, we
used intention-to-treat analyses to
examine impacts of the program,
including all clusters and adolescents,
irrespective of program uptake (uptake
was 48.5% among those eligible),40
among participants who were inter-
viewed at all 3 rounds. We calculated
intervention effects with data sepa-
rately at each follow-up round by using
ordinary least squares for continuous
outcomes and linear probability models
for binary outcomes. For continuous
and binary outcomes, we reported b
coefﬁcients. We adjusted the regres-
sion models for age, sex, and stratum
(district and village size), and we
adjusted standard errors for clustering
and heteroskedasticity by using the
VCE (robust) command in Stata version
16 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
We further calculated average-treat-
ment-on-the-treated estimates by
using 2-stage least squares regressions
with linear probability models, in which
we predicted program take up in the
ﬁrst-stage regressions and treatment
impacts on the treated in the second
stage.
We tested program impacts on
potential pathways of impact at rounds
2 and 3, and then tested pathway
impacts by gender at round 3 only. We
describe perpetrators of violence
descriptively only, given low
proportions in the categories of perpe-
trators and limited power to estimate
program impacts.
RESULTS
Out of 3599 adolescents found eligible
at baseline, a total of 2458 completed
interviews (68%). Among this baseline
evaluation sample (n 5 2458), approxi-
mately half (n 5 1165) were interviewed
for the violence questions, and, among
these, 988 and 1033 were followed up
at rounds 2 and 3, respectively, repre-
senting the panel samples (Appendix
F). Among the panel sample inter-
viewed at all 3 rounds (n 5 904), no
adolescents had missing values for vari-
ables of interest. The average age of
the sample at baseline was 16 years,
47.4% of the sample were female, and
57% were attending school (Table 1).
All background characteristics were bal-
anced at baseline between study arms.
Outcomes
At baseline, 35%, 27%, and 1% of ado-
lescents reported having experienced
emotional, physical, and sexual vio-
lence, respectively (Table 1). Physical
and sexual violence outcomes were
balanced at baseline in the pooled
(male and female participants) sample,
while emotional violence was not (39%
of the treatment group vs 31% of con-
trols had experienced emotional
violence). Among those who had expe-
rienced physical or emotional violence
(n 5 404), 31.7% reported seeking help
or disclosing to someone (8.4% to for-
mal sources vs 24.5% to informal sour-
ces). Examining indicators by gender,
we found evidence for baseline balance
for all characteristics and outcomes,
except farm work for the household
excluding livestock among female
participants and experience of physical
violence and informal reporting of vio-
lence among male participants (Appen-
dix G, available as a supplement to the
online version of this article at http://
www.ajph.org). By round 3, experiences
of violence among the control (treat-
ment) group were 33% (29%) for emo-
tional violence, 13% (11.1%) for physical
violence, and 6% (2%) for sexual vio-
lence (Table 2).
Intervention Impacts
By round 3, treatment adolescents had
a 3-percentage-point reduction of
experiencing sexual violence as a result
of the intervention (b 5 20.03; 95%
conﬁdence interval [CI] 5 20.06, 20.00;
Table 2). The intervention had no
impact on emotional or physical vio-
lence experiences in the pooled sam-
ple, nor on help seeking (formal or
informal sources). When examining
impacts separately by gender, we saw
that the sexual violence impacts were
driven by the female sample, who expe-
rienced a 5-percentage-point reduction
in sexual violence (b 5 20.05; 95%
CI 5 20.10, 20.00; Table 3) as a result
of the program (there were no impacts
on this indicator among male partici-
pants, who reported low rates of sexual
violence; Table 3). Impacts at round 2
are presented in Appendix H (available
as a supplement to the online version
of this article at http://www.ajph.org).
In the pooled sample we found no
impacts on emotional and physical vio-
lence perpetration. However, when we
examined male and female participants
separately, we found that male partici-
pants were less likely to report physical
violence perpetration as a result of the
intervention (b 5 20.06; 95%
CI 5 20.10, 20.02; Table 3). There were
no impacts on emotional violence

nor on either outcome among female
participants.
There were no impacts on help seek-
ing among either gender (Table 3).
Pathways Analyses
We found positive impacts on participa-
tion in livestock herding for the house-
hold (b 5 0.09; 95% CI 5 0.02, 0.17;
Table 4) and self-esteem (b 5 0.19; 95%

vention impacts on self-perceived
stress, self-efﬁcacy (locus of control),
marriage or cohabitation, school atten-
dance, or age-disparate relationships.
When we examined pathway impacts
separately by gender (Appendix I, avail-
able as a supplement to the online ver-
sion of this article at http://www.ajph.
org), we saw that changes in livestock
herding were driven by female partici-
pants (b 5 0.14; 95% CI 5 0.03, 0.24),
while we observed increases in self-
esteem for both female (b 5 0.19; 95%
CI 5 0.05, 0.33) and male participants
(b 5 0.29; 95% CI 5 0.05, 0.36). In addi-
tion, among female participants, we
found a protective impact on delaying
age at ﬁrst sexual intercourse (b 5 20.
55; 95% CI 5 21.02, 20.09) and a nega-
tive impact on school attendance
(b 5 20.10; 95% CI 5 20.19, 0.00). This
delay in sexual debut translates to
approximately half a year (0.55 3

experience of sexual violence among
female participants and perpetration of
physical violence among male
participants.
With respect to pathways, we found
that the program increased self-esteem
and led to changes in time use—
namely, participation in livestock herd-
ing among female participants. We also
found that the program delayed age at
sexual debut by half a year and
reduced school attendance among
female participants. We found no
impacts on other pathways. By delaying
the window of exposure to sexual rela-
tionships, this may have prevented inti-
mate partner sexual violence. Increases
in self-esteem may have led to reduced
sexual violence via improved assertive-
ness, communication, and interper-
sonal skills learned in the trainings.
Previous research has found that a lack
of these skills may contribute to sexual
violence risk in southern Africa.41 This
may, in part, explain why we found pro-
tective effects for sexual violence but
no other forms of violence. Moreover,

previous evidence demonstrates a link
between low self-esteem and increased
risk of both experiencing and perpe-
trating dating violence among adoles-
cents,42 and given positive impacts on
self-esteem in our study, this is a poten-
tial pathway for the observed reduc-
tions in violence experiences and
perpetration.
In a context with limited formal
employment opportunities, when older
female participants were presented
with the opportunity to start a busi-
ness, they may have opted to do so,
possibly explaining negative school
attendance impacts. Changes in school
attendance could have affected expo-
sure to environments where adoles-
cents are at risk for violence, but our
data do not allow us to make more
detailed conclusions about this path-
way. Although we did not ask about
perpetrators of sexual violence
because of the sensitive nature of this
information, peers and authority ﬁg-
ures were common perpetrators of
emotional and physical violence. These
ﬁndings are supported by a global
meta-analysis that found that student
peers are the second-most-common
perpetrators of VAC.22
The observed impact on livestock
herding is likely a result of the training
around business planning and starting
a business, and some participants
invested in small livestock with the aim
of selling them for a proﬁt. Some pro-
gram mentors were agriculture exten-
sion workers, which may have also
inﬂuenced choices. Another study from
this sample found that engaging in paid
work outside the household was asso-
ciated with increased risk of experienc-
ing sexual violence and emotional vio-
lence, while livestock herding was
associated with increased risk of
experiencing emotional and physical
violence perpetrated by family mem-
bers (T. P., written communication, July
15, 2020). Thus, more participation in
livestock herding induced by the inter-
vention may be protective against sex-
ual violence when resulting from a
substitution from paid labor outside
the household. However, we found
no simultaneous decreases in the
latter.
The intervention led to an increase in
equitable gender attitudes (including
around violence) among male partici-
pants, examined elsewhere.39 This
pathway may partly explain decreases
in physical violence perpetration, as
attitudes about sex, gender, normative
behaviors, and hostile masculinity are
learned in adolescence,41,43 and, thus,
this is a key window to model equitable
gender norms and healthy relation-
ships.44 These ﬁndings may have impli-
cations for reducing future violence
perpetration.
Our ﬁndings are consistent with
those from an intervention in Uganda16
but are in contrast with studies from
Uganda, Zambia, and Liberia that did
not ﬁnd protective effects against vio-
lence.15,19,21 These mixed ﬁndings
underscore that context matters in
violence-reduction interventions, as do
program design and implementation.
Among the cited studies, there is
variation in program components,
implementing agencies, and dosage of
exposure to components. It is difﬁcult
to make conclusions about which com-
binations are most effective in reducing
VAC because few studies have tested
different combinations of components,
and there have been limited examples
of the same program being imple-
mented in multiple contexts. In our
own study, we were unable to distin-
guish impacts of the individual interven-
tion components because we could not
vary program components across
villages.
Studies that have evaluated impacts
of cash transfers (in contrast with our
study, which only evaluated the “plus”
components in cash plus) have found
positive impacts on school atten-
dance,45,46 reductions in intimate part-
ner violence among adolescents,34 and
reductions in other violence-related
outcomes among children and adoles-
cents.10 These studies are not in con-
trast with our ﬁndings, because the
interventions studied were different
(cash transfers vs “plus” components).
Other studies examining effects of cash
plus programs have found that these
reduced violence against adolescents
and youths,14 as well as harsh discipline
or corporal punishment among young
children.13,47,48
Limitations
Generalizability of the results to all
adolescents in Tanzania is limited. In
addition, the productive grant was dis-
bursed shortly before round 3, and,
thus, full impacts of the intervention
may not have fully materialized. During
round 3 ﬁeldwork, households experi-
enced a delay in PSSN payments for
the ﬁrst time, and this may have miti-
gated impacts of the cash plus pro-
gram. Underreporting of violence is not
expected to be correlated with treat-
ment status and therefore should not
bias impact estimates. Perpetration of
physical and emotional violence was
not assessed at baseline so we could
not assess balance between interven-
tion arms before program roll-out. Our
study design did not allow us to disen-
tangle effects of the different program
components, and, thus, we could not
conclude which components may have
contributed more to violence

reduction. Finally, it is possible that our
subanalyses were subject to type II
errors, as power is reduced as sample
sizes are reduced, and ability to make
conclusions about heterogeneous
treatment effects is limited.
A key factor in the successful imple-
mentation of this intervention was mul-
tisectoral coordination, including at the
district level, where staff were based
and activities were implemented. While
most program components were
administered through PSSN structures,
health facilities strengthening was car-
ried out by Ministry of Health, Commu-
nity Development, Gender, Elderly, and
Children, with technical support from
UNICEF.
Conclusions
Multisectoral approaches are increas-
ingly advocated to address the drivers
of violence. Our study showed that a
government-run, multisectoral cash
plus intervention reduced violence
experiences and perpetration. The
broad potential reach of similar scal-
able interventions has implications for
VAC reduction at the population level.
