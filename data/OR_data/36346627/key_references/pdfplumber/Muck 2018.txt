Abstract
Numerous school-based prevention programs have been developed by
scientists and practitioners to address sexual violence in adolescence.
However, such programs struggle with two major challenges. First, the
effectiveness of many well-established practitioner programs has not been
rigorously evaluated. Second, effective scientific programs may be hard
to implement into everyday school practice. Combining the knowledge
of scientists and practitioners in a scientist-practitioner program could
be a helpful compromise. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the
effects of a scientist-practitioner program and a practitioner program using
a cluster-randomized experimental design. Twenty-seven school classes
were randomly assigned to either one of two programs or a control
group. Outcome variables (knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and iatrogenic
effects) were assessed at pretest, posttest, and a 6-month follow-up for

453 adolescents (55% female, Mage = 14.18). Short-term effects were found
in both programs regarding general knowledge, knowledge of professional
help, and victim-blaming attitudes. Long-term effects were found in both
programs regarding general knowledge and knowledge of professional
help and, in the practitioner program, in a reduction of victimization. No
other effects were found on attitudes and behavior. No iatrogenic effects
in the form of increased anxiety were found. Both the scientist-practitioner
and the practitioner program show promise for the prevention of sexual
violence in adolescence; in particular, the practitioner program may be a
more cost-effective method.

Introduction
Sexual violence (SV) is a worldwide health problem that can occur at every
stage of life (Barth, Bermetz, Heim, Trelle, & Tonia, 2013; Krebs et al., 2016;
Leen et al., 2013; Pereda, Guilera, Forns, & Gómez-Benito, 2009). The nega-
tive consequences of SV have been thoroughly documented (Exner-Cortens,
Eckenrode, & Rothman, 2013; Foshee, Reyes, Gottfredson, Chang, & Ennett,
2013; Lormand et al., 2013; Oddone Paolucci, Genuis, & Violato, 2001;
Roberts, Klein, & Fisher, 2003; Smith, White, & Holland, 2003; Widom,
DuMont, & Czaja, 2007). While help services, such as therapy and counsel-
ing, aim to assist those who have already experienced SV, prevention offers
the opportunity to reduce the rates and consequences of SV in the first place.
Especially helpful may be school-based prevention programs, as they can
reach many students and therefore may help reduce SV through societal
impact. However, many SV prevention programs lack rigorous evaluation
and are based on practice experience and not on scientific evidence (Anderson
& Whiston, 2005; DeGue et al., 2014; Yeater & O’Donohue, 1999). In con-
trast, evidence-based programs for adolescents such as Safe Dates (Foshee
et al., 2005) and Shifting Boundaries (Taylor, Stein, Mumford, & Woods,
2013) show promising results in the reduction of SV. However, these pro-
grams require certain conditions that may be difficult to implement into
everyday school practice because many schools have limited time for extra-
curricular programs (Greytak, 2003). Therefore, the present study aims to
evaluate the effectiveness of (a) a well-established but not yet rigorously
evaluated practitioner program (PP), which takes into account the limitations
Muck et al. 3
of everyday school settings, and (b) a scientist-practitioner program (SPP),
which takes into account both the evidence of prevention research and the
practical time limitations in schools.
Basile, Smith, Breiding, Black, and Mahendra (2014) defined SV as “a
sexual act committed or attempted by another person without freely given
consent of the victim or against someone who is unable to consent or refuse”
(p. 11). This includes, for instance, forced or drug-facilitated penetration of a
victim, nonphysically pressured unwanted penetration, intentional sexual
touching, or nonphysical acts of a sexual nature. However, there is no com-
mon scientific definition of SV, which makes it difficult to give an accurate
overview of its prevalence (Leen et al., 2013).
SV can occur at every stage of life, but high rates of SV victimization and
perpetration have often been reported during adolescence (Leen et al., 2013;
Roberts et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2003; Stöckl, March, Pallitto, & Garcia-
Moreno, 2014; Williams et al., 2014; Young, Grey, & Boyd, 2009). Williams
and colleagues (2014) found in a U.S. sample that 22% of female and 13% of
male adolescents experienced some form of SV victimization. Also, SV victim-
ization in dating situations, such as in first romantic partnerships, have been
investigated more in recent years (Cutbush, Williams, & Miller, 2016; Garthe,
Sullivan, & McDaniel, 2017; Hamby, Finkelhor, & Turner, 2012; Lundgren &
Amin, 2015; Stöckl et al., 2014). In Germany, the Federal Centre for Health
Education (BZgA) found that 20% to 22% of female and 4% to 6% of male
adolescents have experienced some form of SV victimization in dating situa-
tions (Heßling & Bode, 2015). However, there is still limited data on the preva-
lence of SV during adolescence in Germany, and in general, prevalence data
need to be compared with caution, because frequency reports often use different
study designs. For example, Williams and colleagues (2014) used a 12-month
prevalence design, whereas the BZgA used lifetime prevalence (Heßling &
Bode, 2015). Although it is difficult to make an exact comparison between
countries and studies, the current data nevertheless suggest a high SV victimiza-
tion rate in Germany, which seems to be comparable with U.S. studies.
Because Krahé (2009) found that only a small proportion of SV derives
from dating violence, it is reasonable to take into account other forms of SV.
Furthermore, the high rates of SV victimization in adolescence call for effec-
tive prevention strategies, which could help reduce the rate of SV victimiza-
tion in dating and other situations. Currently, the only effective programs for
reducing SV victimization and perpetration have targeted adolescents, sug-
gesting that adolescence may be a critical and important time to intervene
(DeGue et al., 2014; Whitaker, Murphy, Eckhardt, Hodges, & Cowart, 2013).
Many prevention programs adopt universal prevention strategies, which
“can be advocated confidently for the general public” (Gordon, 1983, p. 108).
Furthermore, a lot of programs target specific age groups and can be
4 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 00(0)
conducted in the school setting (Fryda & Hulme, 2015; Topping & Barron,
2009). Also, school-based programs have the advantage of reaching students
more easily and thus can be implemented in a cost-efficient manner (Greytak,
2003; Topping & Barron, 2009). To give a brief overview of school-based
prevention of SV, we briefly describe the general conditions and evaluation
results of programs targeting adolescents.
General Conditions of School-Based Prevention
Certain general conditions, namely, student participation, number of ses-
sions, and gender of the audience, seem to have an impact on program effec-
tiveness (Anderson & Whiston, 2005; Davis & Gidycz, 2000; Vladutiu,
Martin, & Macy, 2011). In general, active participation in programs, for
instance, through role-playing, results in greater effect sizes (Davis & Gidycz,
2000). However, the extent of participation differs due to the mode of presen-
tation, which is most often didactic with a form of discussion (Morrison,
Hardison, Mathew, & O’Neil, 2004); some programs have featured video or
slide presentations (Hilton, Harris, Rice, Krans, & Lavigne, 1998; Lavoie,
Vézina, Piché, & Boivin, 1995; Pacifici, Stoolmiller, & Nelson, 2001), role-
playing (Pacifici et al., 2001; Wright, Akers, & Rita, 2000), and worksheets
(Hilton et al., 1998).
Prevention research has also shown that programs with several sessions
show greater effect sizes in contrast to programs with one brief session (Davis
& Gidycz, 2000). However, the number of sessions in evaluation studies var-
ies widely (DeGue et al., 2014), which makes it difficult to give an ideal
reference number. Also, many programs are implemented in one brief psy-
choeducational session (DeGue et al., 2014), which may be, in part, due to
everyday school restrictions that limit time for extracurricular programs
(Edwards & Hinsz, 2014; Greytak, 2003). Although it seems reasonable that
implementing several sessions may result in stronger outcomes, limitations
within everyday school practice call for prevention programs that are as brief
as possible.
Regarding audience, most programs targeting adolescents implement
mixed-gender groups (Morrison et al., 2004); however, research has shown
conflicting findings on whether mixed-gender or single-gender audiences
yield higher effects in SV outcomes (Espelage, Low, Polanin, & Brown,
2015; Vladutiu et al., 2011; Wolfe et al., 2009). A combination of mixed- and
single-gender aspects seems to be promising, as it includes advantages of
both approaches (Anderson & Whiston, 2005; Vladutiu et al., 2011).
In sum, although prevention research has shown the benefits of various
general conditions, such as several sessions, active participation by students,
Muck et al. 5
and maybe a combination of mixed-gender and single-genders aspects, these
conditions are difficult to implement into everyday school practice due to
time restrictions (Edwards & Hinsz, 2014; Greytak, 2003). Thus, a scientist-
practitioner approach that takes into account the results of previous preven-
tion research, and also, the limitations of school practice could be a realistic
and helpful compromise. Also, only a few studies have investigated differ-
ences in certain general conditions for prevention programs. For example,
Taylor and colleagues (2013) contrasted a classroom intervention with a
building-based intervention and found that only the building-based interven-
tion showed significant effects. It is nessescary to continue investigating cer-
tain general conditions that may affect program effectiveness.
Evaluation of Prevention Programs Targeting Adolescents
The overall findings from reviews show that school-based SV prevention
programs for adolescents are effective (DeGue et al., 2014; Fryda & Hulme,
2015; Morrison et al., 2004; Topping & Barron, 2009). Morrison and col-
leagues (2004) found seven distinct outcome variables in school-based SV
prevention programs aimed at adolescents including (a) enhanced general
knowledge about SV; (b) enhanced knowledge about professional help ser-
vices; (c) reduced attitudes in rape myths, such as victim-blaming attitudes;
(d) increased skills/strategies developed as a result of the program, such as
perceptions and appraisal of personal space; (e) altered dating behavior, such
as increased use of communication and conflict skills; (f) reduced victimiza-
tion; and (g) reduced perpetration.
Of these, the most commonly investigated outcome variables in adoles-
cent SV prevention are changes in knowledge and attitudes (Daigneault et al.,
2015; Ting, 2009). Ting (2009) found in a meta-analysis that effect sizes for
changes in knowledge (r = .35) and attitudes (r =.32) were similar in
magnitude.
Recently, some studies have focused more on behavioral outcomes
(Daigneault et al., 2015; Foshee et al., 2005 Taylor et al., 2013). For example,
evidence-based programs that have shown a positive impact on SV behav-
ioral outcomes are the Safe Dates program (Foshee et al., 2005) and the
Shifting Boundaries program (Taylor et al., 2013). The Safe Dates program
consists of nine mixed-gender sessions of 50 min, a 45-min theater play per-
formed by students, and a poster contest. The nine sessions include the fol-
lowing topics: (a) defining caring relationships; (b) defining dating abuse; (c)
why do people abuse? (d) how to help friends; (e) helping friends; (f) over-
coming gender stereotypes; (g) equal power through communication; (h)
how we feel, how we deal; and (i) preventing dating sexual abuse. Although
6 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 00(0)
the program focuses on dating violence, there are many overlaps to SV pre-
vention because they tackle similar risk-factors. Overall, Foshee and col-
leagues (2005) found that this program does indeed reduce SV
victimization.
The Shifting Boundaries program (Taylor et al., 2013) consists of a class-
room curriculum with six sessions including the following topics: (a) con-
struction of gender roles, (b) setting and communicating of boundaries in
interpersonal relationships, (c) healthy relationships, (d) the role of bystander
as intervener, (e) consequences of perpetrating, and (f) state and federal laws
related to dating violence and sexual harassment. The program focuses on
dating violence and sexual harassment and therefore integrates factors for
both forms of violence. The program also has a school-level intervention
affecting the entire school building. While Taylor and colleagues (2013) did
find that SV was reduced when the classroom curriculum was combined with
the school-level intervention, they did not find positive effects from the class-
room curriculum only.
Some studies have investigated the iatrogenic effects of prevention pro-
grams, such as an increase in anxiety about SV, but did not find any negative
outcomes (DeGue et al., 2014; Fryda & Hulme, 2015). However, it is still
important to control for possible iatrogenic findings such as anxiety, because
some have questioned whether the benefits of prevention programs actually
outweigh possible negative effects (Fryda & Hulme, 2015). In addition, many
SV prevention studies lack a follow-up measure, a control group, and/or
some form of controlled randomization (DeGue et al., 2014; Fryda & Hulme,
2015), which show the need for more rigorous prevention research.
Also, as Sears, Byers, Whelan, and Saint-Pierre (2006) pointed out, many
SV evaluation studies for adolescents have relied on measures that were ini-
tially designed for college students and do not particularly reflect adoles-
cents’ ideas of sexual and/or dating violence. Thus, several authors have
devised their own outcome measures or heavily adapted standardized tools
(Fryda & Hulme, 2015). Furthermore, many existing instruments are
expressed in a gender-stereotypical way. For example, the Illinois Rape Myth
Acceptance Scale (McMahon, 2010) consists mostly of items in which
females are possible victims and males are possible perpetrators. Although
female victimization rates are on average higher, many male adolescents
have experienced severe forms of SV, which is why we consider gender sen-
sitiveness in evaluation measures and program delivery to be very
important.
In Germany, SV prevention programs generally include the same compo-
nents documented by Anglo-American literature, but only a few prevention
programs have been rigorously evaluated (Krahé & Knappert, 2009). The
Muck et al. 7
first aim of the present study is to provide a systematic and rigorous evalua-
tion of a universal SV prevention program for adolescents. Although SV pre-
vention research has shown that certain adolescents are more at risk of SV
than others (e.g., Garthe et al., 2017), targeting specific subgroups during a
school curriculum in Germany could easily lead to stigmatization. This is
why we preferred a universal prevention programing approach targeting all
adolescents instead of a selective prevention approach. Based on the evalua-
tion model of Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick (2006), we included outcome vari-
ables at different evaluation levels, thus allowing for a more detailed
interpretation of program effectiveness. A second aim is to contrast two ver-
sions of the prevention program on their short- and long-term effectiveness.
Evaluation Model
To make accurate conclusions about the effectiveness of a prevention pro-
gram, we applied a utility-oriented evaluation model. In this model, as
described by Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick (2006), there are four distinct and
hierarchical levels for program evaluation. The first level, reaction, describes
the overall satisfaction with and acceptance of the prevention program.
Positive effects on the reaction level, namely, satisfaction, is an essential pre-
condition for effects on the other levels. The second level, learning, considers
effects with respect to knowledge, attitudes, and other nonbehavioral con-
structs. The third level, behavior, describes effects on concrete behavior, such
as victimization and perpetration. The fourth level, results, includes long-
term changes on a societal level. The present study examines the effects of
the prevention program on the first, second, and third levels. At the first level,
we investigated participants’ satisfaction with the program. At the second
level, we investigated general knowledge about SV, knowledge about profes-
sional help, victim-blaming attitudes, anxiety, and personal space perception
and appraisal. The third level, behavior, was examined by participants’ vic-
timization and perpetration.
Prevention Programs
Two school-based prevention programs were administered in cooperation
with a local counseling center, (Zartbitter Muenster), which offers profes-
sional help for female and male victims of SV and offers multiple forms of
SV prevention, for instance, through school-based programs or trainings for
professionals in social work. The school-based prevention programs were
delivered by a female and a male psychologist from the counseling center so
that students had an explicit contact person for professional help in case of
8 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 00(0)
victimization and also so that female and male students were addressed in a
gender-sensitive way. Both facilitators delivered all sessions and had several
years of experience in the practice of SV prevention and in SV prevention
research, as they conducted an evaluation of an SV prevention program prior
to the study. Both programs focus on SV in general, although aspects of dat-
ing violence are also explicitly discussed. Teachers did not participate to cre-
ate a private environment for adolescents. The programs were designed to be
administered in either the eighth or ninth grade to coincide with developmen-
tal aspects of adolescence, such as first dating or sexual experiences.
The prevention programs applied in this study—the PP and the SPP—dif-
fered in their duration, active participation by students, and the gender com-
position of the audience, but they did not differ with regard to content. While
both programs (PP and SPP) used a fixed curriculum to deliver the same
program topics in every class in the same way, the programs are not standard-
ized parts of an SV prevention program. The curriculum included the follow-
ing content: (a) general knowledge about SV: providing a definition and
general information about SV; (2) knowledge about professional help: pro-
viding information about local and online professional help services; (3) vic-
tim blaming: discussing rape myths, in particular, victim-blaming attitudes,
through various sample cases; and (4) personal space: raising the perception
and appraisal for one’s own and others’ personal space through practical
exercises.
The curriculum of the prevention programs included personal space
because Taylor, Stein, and Burden (2010) found that it was a dimension in a
factor analysis of SV attitudes. The authors also found that personal space
attitudes influenced the outcomes of a gender violence and sexual harassment
prevention program (Taylor et al., 2010). Furthermore, in Germany, exercises
for personal space (or boundaries) have also been implemented in many spe-
cialized counseling centers’ programs for SV. For example, in an exercise for
personal space where students actively participate, one of the program train-
ers walks slowly toward a student (who has consented to participate in the
exercise), and the student then has to say “stop” whenever his or her personal
space has been reached. With this exercise, trainers can highlight many dif-
ferent aspects of personal space perception and appraisal and also actively
involve the students in the program. Finally, we considered personal space
(and victim blaming) as an item that represent attitudes about SV, which
allowed us to include in our evaluation model (based on Kirkpatrick &
Kirkpatrick, 2006) several measures for the second level of learning (knowl-
edge and attitudes).
As mentioned above, the programs we evaluated (PP and SPP) did not
differ in content, but just in the way they were implemented (duration, active
Muck et al. 9
participation by students, and the gender of the audience). The PP, a combina-
tion of psychoeducational and active participation elements, was imple-
mented in a mixed-gender audience only. Content was delivered via input
presentations, worksheets, and quizzes. It consisted of one 90-min session;
therefore, the PP is likely easy to implement into everyday school practice.
For the SPP, the first SPP session was identical to the PP. The SPP also con-
sisted of a second 90-min session, where students were separated by gender
and dealt with the subject more actively through role-playing and group dis-
cussions. As previous prevention research has shown that active participa-
tion, the use of several sessions, and a combination of mixed- and single-gender
aspects yield greater effect sizes for knowlede acquisition and attitude
changes (Anderson & Whiston, 2005; Davis & Gidycz, 2000; DeGue et al.,
2014; Vladutiu et al., 2011), the SPP therefore integrated elements that should
facilitate the program’s effectiveness. Ideally, more sessions should be
included in the SPP, but in Germany, an SV prevention program with more
than two sessions would be hard to implement into everyday school practice
because of the limited time available for extracurricular programs.
We hypothesized that in comparison with the control group, both program
groups would (1) increase general knowledge of SV; (2) increase knowledge
of professional help services; (3) reduce victim-blaming attitudes; (4) show
no iatrogenic findings, namely, no increased anxiety regarding SV; (5)
increase personal space perception and appraisal; (6) reduce rates of SV vic-
timization; and (7) reduce rates of SV perpetration. As the SPP consisted of
an additional session with more active participation and role-playing, which
have been shown to be more effective regarding knowledge acquisition and
attitude changes (Anderson & Whiston, 2005; Davis & Gidycz, 2000; DeGue
et al., 2014; Vladutiu et al., 2011), we therefore hypothesized that the SPP
would be more effective than the PP for the following outcome variables: (a)
increasing general knowledge of SV, (b) increase knowledge of professional
help services, (c) reducing victim-blaming attitudes, and (d) increasing per-
sonal space perception and appraisal. Finally, we investigated gender effects
and short-term and long-term effects in a 6-month follow-up.
Method
Design and Procedure
Data were collected between May 2014 and June 2015 with a clustered ran-
domized controlled pre–post follow-up design with two intervention groups
and a control group. Classes were randomly assigned to either the SPP, the
PP, or the control group. The participants in the intervention groups and the
10 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 00(0)
control group received a follow-up measure 6 months after the intervention.
One week later, the control group received the PP. Thus, the control group
received the PP 6 months and 1 week after the intervention groups.
A paper-and-pencil questionnaire was administered 1 week before the pro-
grams began (T1), immediately after the programs finished (T2), and after a
6-month follow-up (T3). The temporal intervals between each measurement
were the same in the intervention groups and the control group. All measures
remained identical across the time points. Data from all time points were
matched using a personalized five-digit code that prevented personal identi-
fication. After matching the data, the code was deleted to ensure anonymity.
The study received approval from the local ethical committee of the
Institute of Psychology and Sports Sciences of the University of Muenster.
All participating schools, teachers, and students were given information on
the purpose and design of the study, and about active consent. For consent, a
research assistant verbally informed all possible participants about the study
aims and afterward handed them a written consent form for them and their
parents (or legal guardians) to sign. For study participation, active consent
was required from adolescents and their parents (or legal guardians). We
received active consent from 94.32% of all students (and their parents/legal
guardians) in the schools. Forty-one students did not participate in the study
because they did not give consent.
Both the PP and SPP were conducted in classes consisting of around 25
participants. Single-gender parts of the SPP were conducted in female-only
and male-only groups, each consisting of around 10 to 15 participants. The
two sessions of the SPP were separated by 1 week. For example, if a school
had four participating classes with one class receiving the PP, two classes
receiving the SPP, and one class in the control group, we delivered the PP and
first session of the SPP in one day during the school. The second session of
the SPP was then delivered a week after the first session. If there were several
classes receiving the PP in a school, we held the programs back to back on a
single day. Thus, contamination effects are possible, especially in the control
group.
Sample
We excluded n = 74 participants as they indicated (dichotomous: yes, no) that
they filled in the questionnaire “just for fun” in at least one of the measure-
ments and another n = 154 participants dropped out at either at T2 or T3,
resulting into complete data for N = 453 (55.0% female) participants.
Participants were between 12 and 16 years old (M = 14.18, SD = 0.71), and
attended the eighth (n = 174) and ninth (n = 279) grade. In total, 95% had
Muck et al. 11
German as their first language. Data were collected in 27 classes in five urban
secondary schools (German Gymnasiums). The SPP group consisted of 10
classes (n = 166, 53.0% female), the PP group consisted of eight classes (n =
130, 56.1% female), and the control group consisted of nine classes (n = 157,
56.1% female).
Measures
All measures were self-reported. Many existing instruments did not fit the
purpose of the study because they were written in a gender-specific way, that
is, they suggested only female victimization and male perpetration and not
vice versa. We therefore created new measures using gender-neutral item
wording based on the principles of psychological test construction (Kaplan &
Saccuzzo, 2012). To assure face validity, we generated items for each preven-
tion goal, and therefore, we developed a process model. This method can be
described as experience based, because we also used the opinions of SV pre-
vention experts in the generation of the instruments (Kaplan & Saccuzzo,
2012).
We further used the Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick (2006) model as a guide-
line for developing each of the first three levels of evaluation: (a) reaction, (b)
learning, and (c) behavior. As a measure for the first level, we generated
items for satisfaction. The second level, learning, relied on items for knowl-
edge (general knowledge, knowledge of professional help) and attitudes (vic-
tim blaming, personal space). The third level, behavior, was operationalized
via items on victimization (dating situations, other situations) and perpetra-
tion (dating situations, other situations).
Previous SV prevention measures also served for some instruments. We
used the Revised Version of the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale
(McMahon, 2010) to generate the victim-blaming items, and we used items
from the Shifting Boundaries evaluation measures on personal space (Taylor
et al., 2010) to develop the personal space items. We used the list of tactics by
Struckman-Johnson, Struckman-Johnson, and Anderson (2003) as the basis
for generating the items on victimization and perpetration. Finally, we con-
sulted with SV prevention experts and used SV research facts (i.e., preva-
lence of SV, strategies on SV perpetrators) and SV definitions from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (e.g., Basile et al., 2014) as the
basis for generating the items on general knowledge. All measures were first
tested in a pilot study.
Satisfaction. Students in the program groups rated their satisfaction for the
program with six items (for instance, “Overall I’m satisfied with the
12 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 00(0)
program”) on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (“completely dis-
agree”) to 5 (“completely agree”) at T2. Higher scores indicate more satisfac-
tion with the program. Cronbach’s alpha was α = .83.
General knowledge of sexual violence. A multiple-choice questionnaire was
developed to assess students’ general knowledge of SV (for instance, “Sexual
violence . . . A—can only happen if someone is physically forced to have sex,
B—happens most often through physical violence, C—can be verbal and/or
physical, D—cannot happen verbally”). The questionnaire was matched to
the content of the prevention programs, and each item was presented with
four alternative responses, out of which students had to mark the most appro-
priate one. The questionnaire consisted of 16 items. However, one item did
not meet the inclusion criteria (item difficulty over .85 at T1), and therefore,
the final questionnaire resulted in 15 items. Sum scores were calculated so
that a maximum score of 15 could be achieved. Higher scores indicate more
general knowledge about SV.
Knowledge of professional help. The knowledge of professional help services was
measured with two items concerning local and online help services (“I know of
professional local help services regarding sexual violence” and “I know of pro-
fessional online help services regarding sexual violence”) on a 5-point Likert-
type scale ranging from 1 (“completely disagree”) to 5 (“completely agree”).
Higher scores indicate more knowledge of professional help services.
Victim-blaming attitudes. Victim-blaming attitudes were measured using
adapted items from the “she asked for it” subscale of the Illinois Rape Myth
Acceptance Scale (revised version, McMahon, 2010) using six items (for
instance, “If a person gets raped while being drunk, it is his or her own
responsibility”) on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (“completely
disagree”) to 5 (“completely agree”). Cronbach’s alpha was α = .67 at T1, α
= .76 at T2, and α = .72 at T3.
Anxiety. Iatrogenic findings in the form of anxiety about SV were measured
using six items (for instance, “I am afraid that I could experience sexual
assault”) on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (“completely dis-
agree”) to 5 (“completely agree”). Cronbach’s alpha was α = .87 at T1, α =
.88 at T2, and α = .89 at T3.
Personal space perception. We measured the perception of one’s own and oth-
ers’ personal space using six items (for instance, “I clearly sense if someone
is getting uncomfortably close to me”) on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging
Muck et al. 13
from 1 (“completely disagree”) to 5 (“completely agree”). Cronbach’s alpha
was α = .69 at T1, α = .77 at T2, and α = .78 at T3.
Personal space appraisal. We measured the appraisal of one’s own and others’
personal space using five items (for instance, “It’s important for me that I’m
not getting uncomfortably close to someone else”) on a 5-point Likert-type
scale ranging from 1 (“completely disagree”) to 5 (“completely agree”).
Cronbach’s alpha was α = .66 at T1, α = .62 at T2, and α = .64 at T3.
Victimization. The 6-month prevalence of victimization was estimated based
on six separate statements, which were arranged in a hierarchy of severity of
victimization (for instance, “I have been kissed against my will”; “I have been
forced to do sexual acts against my will”) on a 4-point Likert-type scale rang-
ing from 1 (“never”) to 4 (“frequently”). Participants were instructed to rate
these items according to the past 6 months and to differentiate between victim-
ization in a dating situation (Cronbach’s alpha was α = .74 at T1, α = .83 at T2,
and α = .86 at T3) and other situations (Cronbach’s alpha was α = .69 at T1, α
= .79 at T2, and α = .81 at T3). Because the frequencies of such incidences
were reported to be low, we transformed the items into dichotomized responses
(“victimization” vs. “no victimization”) and computed two sum-score scales
ranging from 0 (“no experienced victimization during the past 6 months”) to 6
(“experienced every of the six forms of SV in the past 6 months”) for victim-
ization in dating situations and victimization in other situations.
Perpetration. The six statements for victimization were rephrased for perpetra-
tion (for instance, “I have kissed someone against his or her will”; “I have
forced someone else to do sexual acts against his or her will”). Participants
were instructed to rate these items according to the past 6 months and to dif-
ferentiate between perpetration in a dating situation (Cronbach’s alpha was α
= .84 at T1, α = .76 at T2, and α = .90 at T3) and other situations (Cronbach’s
alpha was α = .76 at T1, α = .73 at T2, and α = .86 at T3). Because the frequen-
cies of such incidences were reported to be low, we transformed the items into
dichotomized responses (“perpetration” vs. “no perpetration”) and computed
two sum-score scales ranging from 0 (“no perpetration during the past 6
months”) to 6 (“performed every of the six forms of SV in the past 6 months”)
for perpetration in dating situations and perpetration in other situations.
Statistical Methods
To test the effectiveness of the two intervention groups in comparison with
the control group, a series of mixed-effects linear regression models that
14 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 00(0)
included random effects for class and time and fixed effects for group and
gender were computed. By specifying class as a random effect, we controlled
for the clustered design of the data. Adjusted coefficients were estimated via
restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Main effects for time, group, and
gender and two-way interactions (i.e., Time × Group) were tested. Multilevel
modeling was conducted with R using the lme4 package (Finch, Bolin, &
Kelley, 2014). Effect sizes for the intervention effects in the form of Cohen’s
d were computed according to Morris (2008) using the mean scores and stan-
dard deviations.
Results
Baseline and Descriptive Analyses
There were no significant group differences for age, gender, general knowl-
edge, knowledge of professional help, victim blaming, anxiety, personal
space perception, and personal space appraisal at baseline (T1). Table 1
shows the means and standard deviations for the outcome variables at T1, T2,
and T3. At baseline (T1), students were able to correctly answer almost half
of the items from the general knowledge of SV test. Furthermore, at T1,
medium levels were found for knowledge of professional help and anxiety. In
addition, at baseline, low victim-blaming attitudes and high levels of per-
sonal space perception and appraisal were found.
Attrition Analyses
A total of 98 students were lost in the posttest measure and another 130 stu-
dents in the follow-up measure resulting in a total dropout rate of 33.48%.
Dropout analyses showed no significant differences in group affiliation, age,
school affiliation, victim blaming, anxiety of SV, victimization, and perpetra-
tion at T1. However, dropouts were significantly more often boys, χ2(1) =
13.13, p < .001, and dropouts had less general knowledge of SV (M = 5.80,
SD = 2.44) than those who participated in the posttest and follow-up mea-
surement (M = 6.89, SD = 2.66), t(501) = –3.50, p < .001 at T1.
Evaluation Level 1—Reaction
Program satisfaction. Participants in the SPP showed a mean satisfaction score
of M = 4.43 (SD = 0.51), whereas the PP showed a mean score of M = 4.35
(SD = 0.59) indicating participant satisfaction for both program groups. No
group differences on satisfaction were found.

Evaluation Level 2—Learning
Knowledge of sexual violence. Table 2 shows the fixed effects and relevant
interaction effects for general knowledge, knowledge of professional help,
victim blaming, anxiety, personal space perception, and personal space
appraisal with time (T2 and T3) in reference to T1 and with group (SPP and
PP) in reference to the control group. The results for general knowledge
about SV showed a significant interaction effect for the SPP at T2 (p < .001)
and for the PP at T2 (p < .001). This indicates immediate short-term effects
for both program groups in comparison with the control group. These gains
in knowledge were also apparent at T3 (SPP: p < .001; PP: p < .001). Results
for general knowledge also show a main effect for gender at T1 (p < .001),
indicating that at baseline, female participants had greater general knowledge
of SV. There were no other main or interaction effects.
Knowledge of professional help. The results for knowledge of professional help
revealed a significant interaction for both program groups with T2 (SPP: p <
.001; PP: p < .001) and T3 (SPP: p < .01; PP: p < .01), indicating short-term
and long-term effects for both program groups. No main effects or other
interactions were found.
Victim blaming. The results for victim blaming showed that both program
groups had a significant interaction effect with T2 (SPP: p < .05; PP: p < .01),
but not with T3, indicating only short-term effects for both programs in
reducing victim-blaming attitudes. A significant gender effect was found at
T1 (p < .001), indicating that at baseline, female participants showed lower
victim-blaming attitudes than males. No other main effects or other interac-
tions were found.
Anxiety. No significant effects were found for both intervention groups at T2
and T3. These findings suggest no iatrogenic effects on anxiety of SV related
to both programs. However, there was a significant main effect of time at T2
(p < .05) and T3 (p < .05), indicating that anxiety levels decreased over time
in the program groups and the control group. There was also a significant
gender effect at T1 (p < .001), indicating that at baseline, females had higher
levels of anxiety surrounding SV. No other main effects or other interactions
were found.
Personal space perception and appraisal. No effects for both intervention
groups were found regarding personal space perception and appraisal at T2
and T3. There was a significant main effect of gender in personal space

appraisal at T1 (p < .001), indicating that at baseline, female participants had
higher levels of personal space appraisal. No interaction effects for group,
time, and gender were found.
Evaluation of Level 3—Behavior
Victimization and perpetration. Table 3 shows the interaction and main effects
for victimization and perpetration in dating and other situations with time (T2
and T3) in reference to T1 and with group (SPP and PP) in reference to the
control group. We found a significant effect for the PP at T3 for victimization
(p < .05), indicating a small reduction of victimization in dating situations
over time. No other significant effects were found for victimization and per-
petration. Gender effects for victimization in dating situations at T1 (p < .05)
and victimization in other situations at T1 (p < .01) indicate that at baseline,
female participants had higher victimization rates than did male participants.
Gender effects for perpetrating SV in dating situations at T1 (p < .001) and in
other situations at T1 (p < .001) indicate that at baseline, male participants
had higher rates of perpetrating SV than did female participants. No interac-
tion effects for group, time, and gender were found.
Discussion
The present study evaluates the short-term and long-term effectiveness of a
SPP and PP for the prevention of SV in adolescence at three levels (Kirkpatrick
& Kirkpatrick, 2006). On the first evaluation level of reaction, results indi-
cate that participants were satisfied with both programs, which is an essential
precondition for further effects on other levels.
On the second evaluation level of learning, results show large short-term
and long-term effects on general knowledge for both programs, supporting
our first hypothesis. These results are in line with previous evaluation studies
indicating effectiveness of SV programs on general knowledge acquisition
(DeGue et al., 2014; Edwards & Hinsz, 2014; Ting, 2009). The large effects
found here are higher than the medium effect sizes found by Ting (2009).
However, it should be noted that changes in knowledge acquisition do not
necessarily reflect changes on the behavioral level, which may ultimately be
more important in the prevention of SV (Tharp et al., 2011). Effects for the
acquisition of knowledge about professional help were large in the short term
and medium in the long term for both programs, supporting our second
hypothesis. Both programs showed short-term but not long-term effects on
victim-blaming attitudes, which partially supported our third hypothesis. It is
important to note that victim-blaming rates were already low at baseline, and

therefore, there was little room for further reduction. No iatrogenic effects on
anxiety were found in any group, supporting the fourth hypothesis. Apparently,
the anxiety levels toward SV significantly declined in both intervention
groups and the control group. A possible explanation could be that due to
mere exposure of the paper-and-pencil questionnaire, anxiety levels dimin-
ished. No effects were found for the perception and appraisal of personal
space in both programs, indicating that the fifth hypothesis cannot be sup-
ported. However, scores for personal space were already high at baseline,
indicating a possible ceiling effect, which made further increases difficult.
On the third evaluation level of behavior, we found a marginal effect in the
reduction of SV victimization in dating situations in the PP, but no effects on
victimization in other situations in both programs, which only partially sup-
ported our sixth hypothesis. No program effects on SV perpetration in dating
or other situations were found for both programs, and thus, these results did
not support for the seventh hypothesis. However, the results on this level
should be interpreted with caution. First, the reduction in dating victimization
in the PP showed only a marginal significant effect and had a small effect
size. Second, as indicated by the intercept coefficients and means, the rates of
both victimization and perpetration were very low in general. Third, as with
the other outcome variables, social desirability may have had an impact on
students’ interpretations and statements of victimization and perpetration.
Students filled out the questionnaire in the classroom, and some may have
been intimidated because of the social circumstances under which the ques-
tionnaire was administrated. Future research on SV should take into account
the difficulty of measuring highly personal and potentially incriminatory
items, such as victimization and perpetration, in a classroom setting.
Main effects for gender were found in general knowledge of SV, knowl-
edge of professional help, victim blaming, anxiety, personal space appraisal,
victimization, and perpetration at T1. These results indicate that in general,
female adolescents have more general knowledge of SV and knowledge of
professional help for SV, higher rates of anxiety regarding SV, personal space
appraisal, and SV victimization. In general, female students also showed
lower rates of victim blaming and perpetration in comparison with male stu-
dents. However, we did not find any interaction effects of group, time, and
gender, indicating that both female and male adolescents similarly benefited
from the prevention programs. Information on gender differences at baseline
could be useful for adapting mixed- and single-gender aspects of prevention
programs. For example, female adolescents had more general knowledge and
more knowledge about professional help. In Germany, many specialized SV
counseling centers offer help for children, female adolescents, and
women. Male adolescents and men, on the contrary, have far fewer options
Muck et al. 21
for professional help, and thus, information on professional help for male
victims could be implemented into the single-gender sessions. Also, female
adolescents showed a higher rate of anxiety concerning SV, and male adoles-
cents showed higher rates of victim-blaming attitudes. These factors could
also be incorporated into the single-gender sessions, for example, by imple-
menting more risk-reduction strategies in the single-gender session for female
adolescents and more discussion on gender stereotypes and victim-blaming
attitudes in the single-gender session for male adolescents.
With the exception of victimization in dating situations, we found no dif-
ferences between the SPP and the PP. It is possible that the programs were not
different enough. In fact, the first session of the SPP and the PP was identical.
We hypothesized that the addition of a second session with more active par-
ticipation and separation into single-gender audiences would yield higher
effects on attitudinal and behavioral change, because students would have
more time for self-reflection and to discuss the topic with their classmates. It
could be that more than two sessions would be needed to achieve these
results.
These results should be interpreted with caution. Both programs included
psychoeducational and active participation elements, and it is possible that
the active participation elements in the first session had the most impact on
student learning. It could be that the elements of the second session did not
yield any “new” information, and thus, there were no advances in knowledge
or attitudinal changes in the SPP. Although DeGue and colleagues (2014)
stated that brief and psychoeducational-only oriented prevention programs
should be interpreted with caution, we found positive effects in the single-
session PP. However, the PP did include active participation by the students,
and this may be an important link to the effectiveness of a prevention pro-
gram. Although the PP program’s effects on reducing victimization in dating
situations were only marginally significant and showed a small effect size,
this program may be a cost-effective way to promote SV prevention in every-
day school practice.
Study Strengths and Limitations
The main strength of the study is the inclusion of a rigorous evaluation design
with multiple evaluation levels regarding short-term and long-term effects.
Another strength is the contrast of two prevention programs with different
general conditions. The SPP was designed based on the results of prevention
research, such that it included multiple sessions, mixed- and single-gender
aspects, more active participation of the adolescents, while incorporating
limitations of everyday school practice. The PP consisted of one session in a
22 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 00(0)
mixed-gender audience with active student participation, which was identical
to the first session of the SPP. Although research on SV prevention has shown
that student participation, number of sessions, and gender of the audience all
affect outcomes (see Weisz & Black, 2009, for an overview), few studies
have contrasted two prevention programs with differences in these condi-
tions. Our results did not show advantages of the two-session SPP in contrast
to the single-session PP. Another strength was our sample, which included
both female and male adolescents to address gender sensitivity in the study.
A further strength was the direct practical implication for school-based pre-
vention. Both prevention programs can be directly implemented into every-
day school practice, although the PP may be more cost effective. Also, all
students had the opportunity to disclose possible victimization experiences
with a female or male co-worker from the counseling center and thus result-
ing into a low threshold for seeking professional help services.
The present study had also several limitations. First, although we used a clus-
ter-randomized controlled design, we selected five urban secondary schools
(German Gymnasiums) for the intervention, which is not representative of the
general public because, on average, students achieve a higher educational degree
in these schools. Thus, the large effects on general knowledge acquisition may
also be due to the students’ generally high capacity for learning. Also, a more
diverse sample with multiple ethnic backgrounds could have yielded more het-
erogeneous views on gender-based stereotypes, date rape, and victim-blaming
attitudes, which could have explained more variance in the effectiveness of the
prevention programs (Geiger, Fischer, & Eshet, 2004). Second, the study
showed an attrition rate of 33.48% from T1 to T3, which is comparable with
other prevention studies using subject-generated identification codes (Daigneault
et al., 2015). However, dropouts were significantly more often boys and had less
knowledge of SV compared with other participants, which may be a high-risk
group for SV perpetration. Third, we created new measures especially for a
gender-sensitive approach without explicably framing a victim as female and a
perpetrator as male. These new measures resulted in fair to good reliability, but
they are not validated. Also, the study relied on a self-report questionnaire,
which could have several limitations such as recall problems, under-reporting or
exaggeration of behavioral outcomes, or social desirability. Another problem
might have been that students were not able to assess certain variables correctly.
For example, the items on knowledge of professional help only measured sub-
jective knowledge about where to find professional help on the Internet and via
local services. Also, it is not clear what exactly the students considered profes-
sional help when they completed the questionnaire at T1. In Germany, numer-
ous counseling centers offer various assistance services, but these should not be
automatically labeled as professional help for victims of SV. Both the PP and
Muck et al. 23
SPP gave much information about specialized counseling centers for victims of
SV, which are considered professional helping services in Germany. However,
the items we used for knowledge of professional help were not able to differenti-
ate students’ knowledge of these services, so these results should be interpreted
with caution. Future studies could use an open item format in which participants
should note which helping services they are familiar with, which would give a
more accurate estimate on knowledge of professional help.
Practical Implications and Future Developments
The present study showed promising results regarding the prevention of SV.
Both the SPP and the PP showed large effects on the acquisition of general
knowledge. More importantly, the PP showed small effects on the reduction
of SV victimization in dating situations after a 6-month follow-up. These
findings are noteworthy because, to date, only prevention programs that
involve several sessions have shown reductions in SV victimization in ado-
lescents (Foshee et al., 2005; Taylor et al., 2013). The single-session PP may
be a cost-effective way to prevent SV. The PP could also be used as a “treat-
ment as usual” program for future comparisons with other programs. Also,
future research should further investigate the relationship between certain
general program conditions and SV prevention to yield additional effects that
may also impact SV victimization and perpetration.
