reductionsinpeerviolence.Amoreplausibleexplanationfor
the increase in girls’ reports of sexual violence is that the
interventionhascreatedanenvironmentwheretheyfeelmore
able to disclose their experiences. The Toolkit is associated
with increased feelings of safety and well-being in school
(Devries et al. 2015), and it does contain activities which
supportschoolstoimprovetheirinternalsystemstodealwith
disclosures.
It remains unclear why there may be sex differences
in the effects of the Toolkit—the Toolkit explicitly en-
courages equal participation of girls and boys in student
activities, although there is no separate or dedicated
module on encouraging gender equality. The lesser ef-
fect in girls may reflect the degree to which they par-
ticipate in the intervention or could also reflect compet-
ing pressures and other experiences outside the school—
in this context, prevailing gender norms dictate that
girls bear responsibility for household duties and caring
for younger siblings (Evans 2012), which may take up a
large amount of time, possibly increasing absenteeism
and tiredness and concentration difficulties. This may
limit the ability of girls to effectively participate in in-
tervention activities. However, boys are also often re-
sponsible for household tasks such as fetching water
and carrying wood (Evans 2012), so this potential link
needs further investigation. Girls also may be more ex-
posed to other forms of violence outside the school
environment, which might interact with their exposure
to violence inside school (Devries et al. 2014a).
Corporal punishment takes place in schools for a va-
riety of reasons, including as discipline in response to
fighting between peers, non-compliance or misbehaviour
in class, lateness, poor grades, lack of attention or poor
performance in class (Breen et al. 2015; Malak et al.
