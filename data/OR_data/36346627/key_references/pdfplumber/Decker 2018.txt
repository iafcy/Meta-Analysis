Abstract
Background: Globally, sexual violence is prevalent,particularly for adolescent women. This cluster-randomized
controlled implementation trial examinesempowerment self-defense (ESD) for sexual assault risk reduction among
school-age women inMalawi.
Methods: The unitof randomization and analysis was the school (n=141). Interventionparticipants received a 12-h
intervention over 6weeks, withrefreshers.Primaryoutcomes were past-year prevalence and incident rate of sexual
violence. Secondary outcomes included confidence,self-defense knowledge, and, for thosevictimized,violence
disclosure. Interaction effects on outcomes were evaluated withPoissonmodelswith school-correlated robust
variance estimates for risk ratios and incident rate ratios (baseline n=6644,follow-upn=4278).
Results: Past-year sexual assault prevalence was reduced among intervention students (risk ratio [RR] 0.68, 95% CI
0.56,0.82),butnotcontrolstudents(interactioneffectp<0.001).Significantincreasesinself-defenseknowledgewere
