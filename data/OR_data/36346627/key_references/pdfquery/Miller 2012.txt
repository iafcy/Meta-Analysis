Purpose: Dating violence (DV)—physical, sexual, and psychological aggression in adolescent ro- 
mantic relationships—is prevalent among youth. Despite broad calls for primary prevention, few 
programs with demonstrated effectiveness exist. This cluster-randomized trial examined the effec- 
tiveness of a DV perpetration prevention program targeting coaches and high school male athletes. 
Methods: The unit of randomization was the high school (16 schools), and the unit of analysis was the 
athlete (N (cid:1) 2,006 students). Primary outcomes were intentions to intervene, recognition of abusive behav- 
iors, and gender-equitable attitudes. Secondary outcomes explored bystander behaviors and abuse perpe- 
tration. Regression models for clustered, longitudinal data assessed between-arm differences in over-time 
changes in mean levels of continuous outcomes in 1,798 athletes followed up at 3 months. 
Results: Intervention athletes’ changes in intentions to intervene were positive compared with 
control subjects, resulting in an estimated intervention effect of .12 (95% CI: .003, .24). Intervention 
athletes also reported higher levels of positive bystander intervention behavior than control 
.38). Changes in gender-equitable attitudes, recognition of abusive 
subjects (.25, 95% CI: .13, 
behaviors, and DV perpetration were not signiﬁcant. Secondary analyses estimated intervention 
impacts according to intensity of program implementation. Compared with control subjects, ath- 
letes exposed to full-intensity implementation of the intervention demonstrated improvements in 
intentions to intervene (.16, 95% CI: .04, .27), recognition of abusive behaviors (.13, 95% CI: .003, .25), 
and positive bystander intervention (.28, 95% CI: .14, .41). 
Conclusion: This cluster-randomized controlled trial supports the effectiveness of a school athlet- 
ics-based prevention program as one promising strategy to reduce DV perpetration.

Dating violence (DV)—physical, sexual, and psychological ag- 
gression in adolescent romantic relationships—is prevalent 
among youth, with one in three U.S. girls reporting physical, 
emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner [1]. Despite 
broad calls for primary DV prevention [2,3], few programs with 
demonstrated effectiveness exist.

IMPLICATIONS AND 
CONTRIBUTION 
DV is prevalent among ado- 
lescents. Recent prevention 
efforts target attitudes that 
legitimize violence perpe- 
tration by engaging men 
and boys to intervene when 
witnessing harmful behav- 
iors. Evaluation of this ath- 
letic coach-delivered vio- 
lence prevention program 
showed increases in high 
school male athletes’ inten- 
tions to intervene and ac- 
tual bystander intervention 
behaviors. 


Attitudes that legitimize DV perpetration have been identi- 
ﬁed as modiﬁable perpetration risk factors [4 –12]. Because DV 
perpetration often emerges in the context of male peers who 
demonstrate negative attitudes toward women and promote 
abuse perpetration [13–15], prevention requires addressing per- 
petrator attitudes and behaviors as well as the peer environment 
in which they are embedded. Studies suggest the utility of inter- 
ventions rooted in social norms theory, which posits that indi- 
vidual behavior is informed by perceptions and misperceptions 
of others’ attitudes and behaviors [13,16]. Engaging men and 
boys to promote nonviolent, gender-equitable attitudes is in- 
creasingly recognized by major global health organizations as a 
critical public health strategy to reduce violence against women 
[17–19]. 
Perceived peer tolerance for DV may reduce men’s and boys’ 
comfort and ability to intervene when witnessing such negative 
behaviors among their peers. The bystander approach—teaching 
individuals to intervene when faced with their peers’ DV-related 
behaviors, rather than respond with apathy or tolerance— could 
be a powerful component of such social change [20,21]. In a 
college sample, inclusion of a bystander education component 
facilitated greater modiﬁcation of harmful attitudes compared 
with standard sexual assault training [22]. Other sexual violence 
prevention programs have successfully engaged college students 
to intervene when witnessing peers’ abusive behaviors [14,23– 
26]. A bystander approach to address DV has not been rigorously 
evaluated among high school students. 
Male student athletes constitute an important target for DV 
prevention, given the relatively higher prevalence of DV perpe- 
tration and endorsement of attitudes supportive of violence 
against women among athletes [26,27]. Athletes also demon- 
strate greater leadership ability compared with nonathletes [28], 
suggesting that interventions with this population may diffuse 
through student populations [29 –31]. Coaches are a natural ally 
for such interventions; their role as inﬂuential, nonparental role 
models renders them uniquely poised to positively impact how 
young men think and behave [29]. Thus, training coaches to 
teach adolescent male athletes to prevent DV may be a promising 
strategy to increase knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors that 
reduce DV perpetration. Earlier successes of athletics-based DV 
interventions in college contexts [26], coupled with the high 
prevalence of such abuse among high school youth, point to the 
need for a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the 
impact of training coaches to participate in DV prevention. 


Five large urban school districts in Sacramento County, CA, 
were approached to participate in an evaluation of the “Coaching 
Boys into Men” (CBIM) program in October 2009; one district 
declined. Of the remaining four districts, three had 100% partic- 
ipation of their high schools, and 56% of high schools participated 
in the fourth district, for a total of 16 schools (i.e., clusters). 
Schools declined because of losing an athletics program owing to 
funding cuts, as well as focusing on other academic priorities. 
Each school’s athletic director approached all head coaches of 
male and co-educational sports to participate each season (win- 
ter 2009 –2010, spring 2010, and fall 2010). Of the coaches ap- 
proached, 87% agreed to participate. The primary participation 
barrier reported by coaches was lack of time. 
Student athletes received parental consent forms and an in- 
formational letter (available in multiple languages) from study 
staff about the study. Students who returned signed parental 
consent forms and completed youth assent forms were eligible 
to take the surveys. Girls were eligible, but completed a separate 
female-speciﬁc survey, not included in the present analyses. 
Fifteen-minute online surveys were collected at schools for in- 
tervention and control site student athletes (in grades 9 through 
12) at the start of each sports season (winter, spring, fall) (time 
1). Time 2 follow-up surveys were collected for these same ath- 
letes at the end of each sports season (approximately 12 weeks 
after time 1, following program implementation at the interven- 
tion sites). To facilitate anonymous matching of baseline and 
follow-up surveys for statistical analysis, youth self-created an 
identiﬁcation code by responding to questions for which only 
they would know the answer. Students received a $10 gift card 
for participating in each survey. Study methods were approved 
by the University of California Davis Human Subjects Research 
Committee and by each school district. 

CBIM is intended to alter norms that foster DV perpetration by 
engaging athletic coaches as positive role models to deliver vio- 
lence prevention messages to adolescent male athletes. The pro- 
gram consists of a 60-minute training for coaches led by a trained 
violence prevention advocate to introduce the Coaches Kit (avail- 
able at http://coachescorner.org), which provides strategies for 
opening conversation about violence against women with ath- 
letes. Eleven “Training Cards” guide coaches to lead brief (10 –15 
min) weekly discussions with athletes about respect and DV 
prevention throughout the sports season. The advocate is avail- 
able to assist coaches with concerns that arise during program 
delivery, including disclosures. Through this brief coach-led in- 
tervention, the CBIM program is intended to translate into mea- 
surable positive changes in athletes’ attitudes and behaviors 
related to DV (Figure 1). 
A parallel group of athletes in schools randomized to the 
control condition received coaching as usual, meaning the 
coaches were asked to interact with their athletes as they cus- 
tomarily do, without additional guidance. These students were 
assessed using identical surveys, measurement protocols, and 
research staff as for the intervention condition. 


1. Recognition of abusive behavior: A scale developed by Silver- 
man et al [32] to assess perceptions of the degree of abusive- 
ness of speciﬁed relationship behaviors, such as “telling them 
which friends they can or can’t see or talk to,” using a 5-point 
Likert-like scale ranging from “not abusive” to “extremely 
abusive” (Cronbach (cid:1)(cid:1) .93). Recognition of abusive behavior 
was modeled as a mean of responses to 12 items. 
2. Gender-equitable attitudes: This scale includes questions 
modiﬁed from Barker’s Gender-Equitable Norms Scale [33], 
such as “if a girl is raped it is often because she did not say no 
clearly enough.” Responses range from “strongly agree” to 
“strongly disagree” on a 5-point scale (Cronbach (cid:1) (cid:1) .80), 
modeled as a mean of responses to 11 items. 
3. Intentions to intervene when witnessing abusive behaviors: 
These investigator-developed items were pilot tested [34]. For 



each item representing abusive behaviors, participants report 
how likely they would be to do something to stop the behav- 
ior. Responses range from “very unlikely” to “very likely” 
(Cronbach (cid:1) (cid:1) .87), modeled as a mean of eight items. 

4 –5. Positive and negative bystander intervention: Similar to 
items assessing intentions to intervene, these investigator- 
developed items were piloted in a previous study intended to 
identify commonly witnessed behaviors among adolescent 
male athletes (Appendix 1). For each of nine abusive behav- 
iors witnessed among peers or friends in the past 3 months, 
participants reported how they responded to the behavior (if 
witnessed), by selecting all applicable responses from a list 
with two negative behaviors (“I didn’t say anything” and “I 
laughed or went along with it”) and four positive behaviors (“I 
told the person in public that acting like that was not okay”; “I 
told the person in private that acting like that was not okay”; 
“I talked to our coach about it privately”; “I talked to another 
adult [not coach].”). For each abusive behavior, separate bi- 
nary indicators (for any positive and for any negative inter- 
vention) were created. If an abusive behavior was not wit- 
nessed, both indicators were coded 0. The nine positive and 
nine negative indicators were summarized separately to cre- 
ate the positive and negative bystander intervention behavior 
scores. 
6. Abuse perpetration: Athletes who had ever dated a female 
were asked about perpetrating any of 10 abusive behaviors 
toward a female partner in the past 3 months, modiﬁed from 
the Conﬂict Tactics Scale 2 [35], with additional items tested 
during a separate pilot study [34]. A summary DV perpetra- 
tion score was created by adding together any “yes” 
responses. 

Power and sample size estimates were calculated from anal- 
yses of pilot study data, incorporating outcome-speciﬁc variance 
inﬂation factor estimates that accounted for cluster randomiza- 
tion design effects and nonresponse to translate the anticipated 
sample size of 1,500 athletes from 14 schools into outcome- 
speciﬁc effective sample sizes of 750, 395, and 221 for the pri- 
mary knowledge, attitudes, and behavior outcomes, respec- 
tively, sufﬁcient to achieve (cid:2)80% power (under two-sided 
testing with (cid:1) (cid:1) 5%) to detect minimum standardized effects of 
interest [36]. Actual sample size exceeded these targets, as more 
schools agreed to participate (16 clusters) and the study enrolled 
more than 2,000 athletes at baseline. 

After all schools were enrolled, the study statistician devel- 
oped the computer-generated random allocation schedule, en- 
suring that each school had an equal chance of being randomized 
to either arm. 


interactions 
among coaches, athletes, and nonathlete peers, the unit of 
randomization for this trial was the high school, and the unit 
of analysis was the athlete. To account for the clustered ran- 
domized study design and the hierarchical arrangement of our 
data (up to two measurements per athlete, nested within 
team, nested within school, the unit of randomization), a 
combination of survey data analysis methods and multilevel 
mixed-effects models in SAS/STAT software (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC) were used [36 –38]. Bivariate tests of association and 
differences in means were adjusted for design effects, speci- 
fying schools as clusters. Adjusted between-arm differences in 
over-time changes in mean levels of continuous outcomes 
were used to estimate intervention effects and to adjust for 
baseline differences in outcomes, race, grade, immigration 
status, and parental education. These were assessed using 
mixed-effects models for all outcomes except for the by- 
stander intervention outcomes, where clustered data regres- 
sion point and variance estimates were used, to account for 
heteroskedasticity. The primary assessment of intervention 
effects analyzed all available data from athletes who com- 
pleted follow-up. A secondary analysis was conducted to as- 
sess whether intervention effects were stronger with more 
intensive uptake of the intervention. Two-sided testing with a 
per-comparison (cid:1) of 5% was used for all study hypotheses, 
with corresponding single-inference 95% conﬁdence intervals 
reported for intervention effects on each outcome.

Two hundred eight athletes were lost to follow-up (10.4%), 
with more athletes lost to follow-up in the intervention schools. 
These athletes were more likely to be non-Hispanic black and 
less likely to be white, compared with athletes who completed 
the study. Those lost to follow-up were slightly less likely at 
baseline to recognize abusive behaviors than those retained; no 
differences were found regarding baseline values of other study 
outcomes. 
reﬂected the race/ethnicity composition of each school. Control 
athletes were more likely to be white and to have a parent who had 
completed college or graduate school. The sports included were 
basketball and wrestling (winter); baseball, golf, lacrosse, rugby, 
swimming, tennis, track-and-ﬁeld, and volleyball (spring); and 
cross-country, football, soccer, and water polo (fall). 
Eighteen percent of athletes reported any abuse perpetration 
against a female partner in the past 3 months. The mean sum- 
mary scores for past 3-month abuse perpetration were (cid:3)1 at 
baseline and similar in both intervention and control arms 
(where the highest possible score was 10), meaning that few 
athletes reported perpetrating more than one abusive behavior 
against a female partner. Emotional and verbal abuse were the 
most common DV perpetration reported (Table 2).

levels equally (Table 1). Self-reported race/ethnicity by the athletes

tervene, gender-equitable attitudes, and negative bystander in- 
tervention scales (p (cid:3) .05) (Table 3). Regarding “intentions to 
intervene,” control athletes’ adjusted mean scores decreased 
(i.e., worsened) somewhat over time (adjusted mean change (cid:1) 
(cid:4).08; p (cid:1) .07, not statistically signiﬁcant), whereas intervention 
athletes’ mean scores remained stable (adjusted mean change (cid:1) 
.04; p (cid:1) .29), resulting in an estimated intervention effect of .12 
(95% CI: .003–.24). Intervention effects on gender-equitable atti- 
tudes ((cid:4).01; 95% CI: (cid:4).09, .07) and on recognition of abuse (.06; 
95% CI: (cid:4).06, .17) were not statistically signiﬁcant. 

Intervention athletes showed a signiﬁcant increase in pos- 
itive bystander intervention behavior compared with control 
subjects (.25, 95% CI: .13, .38). Changes in DV perpetration and 
negative bystander behavior across intervention and control 
arms were not statistically signiﬁcant in adjusted analyses 
(Table 3). 

According to program guidelines, the minimum require- 
ments for completed intervention delivery (i.e., “full intensity”) 
are coaches’ discussions of at least 9 of the 11 training cards and 
these discussions being conducted across a minimum of one- 
third of the sports season (i.e., 4 weeks). Based on coaches’ 
biweekly phone or e-mail contact with the violence prevention 
advocate as well as a tracking sheet the coaches completed about 
which card was delivered on what date and for what length of 
time, 60.3% of the intervention coaches fulﬁlled these criteria and 
were scored “1.00” on intervention intensity. All the intervention 
coaches reported implementing at least some portion of CBIM, 
thus the remaining intervention coaches were given discounted 
scores between .5 and 1.0 to reﬂect the number of cards dis- 
cussed and weeks spent implementing the program. The primary 
reason coaches offered for not completing the cards in the in- 
tended sequence was not having time in their practice schedule 
to have these discussions with their athletes. In addition, owing 
to personal time constraints, some of the coaches were trained 
after the start of their sports season, and had fewer weeks in 
which to complete the series. 
Intensity-adjusted intervention effects were estimated by 
substituting the intervention intensity score in place of the 
binary intervention indicator used in the primary analysis (far 
right column, Table 3). In addition to the same outcomes 
with statistically signiﬁcant effects in the primary analyses,

Table 3 
Baseline and follow-up means and standard deviations for outcomes of interest among intervention and control participants and regression-adjusted intervention 
effects on mean improvements from baseline to follow-up 
For all scores, except for negative intervention behavior and abuse perpetration, higher scores denote more positive change, that is, higher score in “intentions to 
intervene” indicates athletes reporting greater likelihood to intervene. 
For negative intervention behavior and abuse perpetration, higher scores indicate more negative intervention behaviors and abuse perpetration reported. 
Analysis restricted to 1,798 athletes who completed follow-up. Adjusted intervention effects were estimated in multiple regression models that adjusted for race, grade, 
parental education, and immigrant status. Adjusted intervention effects represent the between-arm contrast in mean over-time changes in study outcomes. Secondary 
analyses estimate intervention effect for athletes exposed to programs with full implementation of the intervention (see text for details). Mixed-effects longitudinal 
models for a nested cohort design (with random effects for schools, for school changes over time, for teams nested within schools, and for athletes nested within teams) 
that used restricted maximum likelihood estimation were used for point estimates and conﬁdence intervals for all outcomes except for the two bystander intervention 
outcomes, for which survey data regression analysis methods for clustered data (with schools speciﬁed as clusters and with the athlete’s baseline value included as a 
covariate in models with follow-up values as the dependent variable) were used to provide heteroskedasticity-robust conﬁdence intervals. The estimated intracluster 
correlation coefﬁcients from the nested cohort analysis of our primary outcomes are computed as the ratio of the estimated variance component for the school-speciﬁc 
changes to the sum of this variance component and the estimated residual error variance component and equal .036, .028, and .024 for the intention to intervene, gender 
attitudes, and recognition of abuse scores, respectively. 
intensity-adjusted intervention effects were associated with 
increases in recognition of abuse. 


This cluster-randomized controlled trial supports the effec- 
tiveness of a school athletics-based prevention program as one 
promising strategy that may help reduce DV perpetration among 
male adolescents. Compared with control participants, athletes 
assigned to the CBIM intervention reported increased intentions 
to intervene and more positive bystander behavior. In secondary 
analyses that adjusted for the intensity of intervention delivery 
(at the program level), full implementation of the intervention 
was also associated with better recognition of abuse. 
This program builds on social norms change theory to in- 
crease bystander behavior related to DV prevention. It is encour- 
aging that this easy-to-implement, coach-delivered prevention 
program was able to achieve small-to-moderate effect sizes us- 
ing rigorous (and conservative) analyses for both intentions to 
intervene and positive bystander behavior. Even with limited 
time available for training coaches and short discussions with 
athletes (constrained by parameters set by coaches to integrate 
this program into busy athletic program schedules), the shifts in 
bystander behavior observed are congruent with the proposed 
conceptual model for this program (Figure 1). Among control 
athletes, the slight decline in intentions to intervene and positive 
bystander behaviors at follow-up might also reﬂect that in the 
absence of such speciﬁc DV education, the peer context of high 
school male athletes may increasingly dissuade youth from be- 
ing positive bystanders during this critical developmental pe- 
riod. Furthermore, emotional and verbal abuse perpetration to- 
ward a female partner appeared to increase among control 
athletes (Table 2), suggesting that the peer context may in fact 
encourage such behaviors. The overall increase in intentions to 
intervene and positive bystander intervention behaviors demon- 
strated among intervention athletes compared with control sub- 
jects suggests the program may protect against the negative 
effects of a social context that discourages bystander interven- 
tion, a hypothesis that merits further study. 
In the intensity-adjusted analyses, statistically signiﬁcant ef- 
fect estimates also emerged for recognition of abusive behaviors. 
Only 60% of the coaches delivered the intervention as intended, 
pointing to the need to better understand barriers in implement- 
ing this program and identifying strategies to assist coaches to 
deliver the entire program throughout the sports season, which 
may be helpful for increasing program effectiveness. 
Incidence of physical or sexual violence perpetrated by ath- 
letes who had ever dated was low, suggesting that the timing of 
this program, which targets high school-aged athletes, is appro- 
priate for primary prevention. There was no statistically signiﬁ- 
cant difference in overall recent DV perpetration comparing in- 
tervention and control athletes who had ever dated. Sexual 
violence prevention programs among college students, which 
used a bystander approach, have demonstrated not only im- 
provements in bystander intervention behaviors [23] but also 
reductions in sexual aggression perpetration [24]. Similarly, by- 
stander intervention approaches with elementary school stu- 
dents to reduce bullying behaviors [39] and with middle school 
students to reduce sexual harassment [40] have been demon- 
strated to be effective in reducing perpetration behaviors. Our 
intervention may not have detected signiﬁcant effects on self- 
reported abuse perpetration, as the outcome measured was DV 
perpetration toward a female partner only (not abusive behav- 
iors against any female more broadly). In addition, it is possible 
that, over time, the increased positive bystander behaviors may 
create a social context that discourages DV and sexual violence 
perpetration. Longitudinal research is needed to explore the 
longer-term impact of this program on overall perpetration be- 
haviors beyond just in romantic relationships. 
The CBIM program did not appear to have an effect on gender- 
equitable attitudes, which suggests that masculinity scripts, in- 
cluding attitudes that condone sexual violence, may be less ame-

nable to change. Instead, CBIM effects may operate through 
increasing recognition of what constitutes abusive behaviors and 
increasing youth self-efﬁcacy to intervene (i.e., strengthening 
the context for more positive bystanders to emerge), rather than 
fundamentally inﬂuencing gender attitudes. The theory that in- 
creasing bystander behaviors over time will result in shifts to- 
ward more gender-equitable attitudes and less violence perpe- 
tration remains to be tested. 

As a cluster-randomized trial located in urban, racially and 
economically diverse public school districts in California, the 
ﬁndings from this study may not generalize to students in private 
schools, suburban or rural areas. The study was restricted to 
youth who returned signed parental consents and were present 
in school to complete both baseline and follow-up surveys (i.e., 
athlete selection bias), and the engagement of willing coaches 
and athletic departments within intervention schools may have 
introduced additional selection bias. Although the cluster ran- 
domization at the school level was intended to address such 
biases, it is possible that the intervention arm differed from the 
control arm in unmeasured ways. In addition, the program con- 
tent speciﬁcally focuses on adolescent male behaviors toward 
females, and does not address DV among same-sex couples or 
sexual violence occurring outside of relationships. 

These ﬁndings should be considered in light of several limita- 
tions. First, reliance on self-report of abuse perpetration and 
bystander intervention may result in underestimates of these 
behaviors. The use of a self-generated anonymous code and com- 
puterized survey administration were intended to reduce under- 
reporting of sensitive items. Second, CBIM was presented to the 
coaches as a voluntary program, thus despite frequent contact 
with coaches to support ﬁdelity to intervention, some coaches 
delivered the program in ways that differed from original inten- 
tion. The secondary analyses, which incorporated an intensity 
score, were conducted to examine whether stronger effects of 
the program would emerge among athletes known to have been 
exposed to the program as intended. Third, control school ath- 
letes were exposed only to coaching as usual, without any addi- 
tional program. Although it is possible that the observed changes 
in the intervention arm were related to having a coach simply 
paying greater attention to their athletes, the changes in recog- 
nition of abusive behaviors indicate a change in knowledge re- 
lated to program content, suggesting that program effects extend 
beyond simple coach engagement with their athletes. In addi- 
tion, the nature of the sample and potential selection biases may 
temper the generalizability of these ﬁndings to diverse youth 
settings. Finally, whether intervention effects last beyond the 
immediate postseason remains to be seen. 

These limitations notwithstanding, this cluster-randomized 
controlled trial found that a brief athletic coach-led DV preven- 
tion program for high school-aged male athletes is associated 
with small-to-moderate increases in youth intentions to inter- 
vene in peer abuse perpetration, positive bystander behaviors, 
and recognition of abusive behaviors. CBIM offers several inno- 
vations to the ﬁeld of DV prevention: (1) engaging nontraditional 
allies, namely, coaches, as active participants in violence preven- 
tion; (2) translating the success of bystander programs among 
college students to a high school population; (3) focusing on 
shifting gender norms and bystander behaviors related to vio- 
lence against women; (4) ensuring relevance to the setting and 
population by using real-world examples where messages to 
athletes are tailored by coaches. The ease of implementation of 
CBIM, that is, short training time and straightforward weekly 
mini-sessions that are simple to deliver, may facilitate its 
uptake among coaches in diverse settings. CBIM may be a 
useful adjunct to school-based violence prevention efforts to 
reduce DV perpetration.
