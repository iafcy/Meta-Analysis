Objectives. To test the efﬁcacy of Me & You, a multilevel technology-enhanced ad- 
olescent dating violence (DV) intervention, in reducing DV perpetration and victimization 
among ethnic-minority early adolescent youths. We assessed secondary impact for 
speciﬁc DV types and psychosocial outcomes. 
Methods. We conducted a group-randomized controlled trial of 10 middle schools 
from a large urban school district in Southeast Texas in 2014 to 2015. We used multilevel 
regression modeling; the ﬁnal analytic sample comprised 709 sixth-grade students 
followed for 1 year. 
Results. Among the total sample, odds of DV perpetration were lower among 
intervention students than among control students (adjusted odds ratio = 0.46; 95% 
conﬁdence interval = 0.28, 0.74). Odds of DV victimization were not signiﬁcantly 
different. There were signiﬁcant effects on some speciﬁc DV types. 
Conclusions. Me & You is effective in reducing DV perpetration and decreasing some 
forms of DV victimization in early middle-school ethnic-minority students. (Am J Public 
Health. 2019;109:1419–1428. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2019.305218) 
ever having a boyfriend or girlfriend.16 
Middle-school dating coincides with puberty 
onset,17,18 when youths may lack cognitive 
skills (e.g., problem solving, managing 
emotions)19,20 for healthy dating.19 In sixth 
grade, almost half of urban dating youths (80% 
African American, 15% Hispanic) reported 
being physically or emotionally victimized by 
a dating partner during the past 3 months 
(race/ethnicity of their perpetrators was not 
reported); one third reported perpetrating 
DV.15 Furthermore, DV increased from sixth 
to eighth grade. Interventions that develop 
cognitive skills for maintaining healthy 


physical, psychological (including 
emotional), and sexual violence, and stalking. 
Some DV types (e.g., psychological, sexual) 
can happen in person or via technology.1 
Though likely underestimates,2 nationally, 
approximately 7% to 8% of high-school ad- 
olescents experience physical and sexual DV.3 
Some studies suggest African American and 
Hispanic youths are more likely to experience 
DV.4–6 Although more research is needed to 
explain these disparities, neighborhood eco- 
nomic disadvantage, as well as racial and 
gender discrimination, may be contributing 
factors.7–9 DV consequences include suicidal 
ideation, substance use, depression,10,11 and 
adult domestic violence,12 with physical, 
mental, and economic costs,13,14 emphasizing 
the need for prevention. 
Dating often begins in middle school (sixth 
to eighth grade, ages 11 to 14 years).15,16 In a 
recent study, almost 50% of predominantly 
urban ethnic-minority sixth graders reported 
dating relationships, particularly among 
ethnic-minority sixth graders, are needed. 
In addition, DV is inﬂuenced by multiple 
socioecological levels (e.g., students, parents, 
school), making multilevel interventions 
needed.21 
Some multilevel middle-school inter- 
ventions have demonstrated DV reduc- 
tions (e.g., Shifting Boundaries, Expect 
Respect, It’s Your Game . . . Keep It Real 
[IYG], Safe Dates, Families for Safe Dates),22–26 
including some among predominantly 
ethnic-minority youths. However, the ma- 
jority were developed for mixed middle- and 
high-school grades, so they may not be 
developmentally appropriate for early ado- 
lescents. In addition, only 1 intervention24 
utilizes technology beyond videos, a limi- 
tation because technology facilitates tai- 
lored education, greater enjoyment, and 
interactivity.27

developmentally appropriate for sixth graders, 
directly addresses determinants (e.g., conﬂict 
resolution skills and norms toward violence) 
of physical DV perpetration,5,30–32 and in- 
cludes DV prevention activities for parents 
and school personnel. We tested the efﬁ- 
cacy of Me & You in reducing DV perpe- 
tration and victimization among urban 
ethnic-minority youths. We hypothesized 
that odds of DV would be lower among 
students who received Me & You than 
among students who did not receive Me 
& You. 

We conducted a group-randomized con- 
trolled trial to evaluate the impact of Me & 
You in reducing DV in a large urban southeast 
Texas school district. We approached 13 
middle schools not currently receiving IYG. 
Ten agreed to participate. We randomized 5 
to intervention and 5 to comparison by using 
a multiattribute randomization protocol33 
accounting for school type (e.g., magnet), 
region, race/ethnicity, sixth-grade enroll- 
ment, percentages of economically disad- 
vantaged students, and students “at risk” for 
drop out. Schools identiﬁed a contact to help 
with logistics. 
All sixth graders who were enrolled in 
health or physical education, spoke English, 
and were not enrolled in special education 
were eligible. Staff described the project to 
youths in class; information was sent home 
to parents, with follow-up packets to non- 
respondents. Students received a $5 gift card 
for returning a parent consent regardless of 
consent status; additional $5 gift cards for 
completing the baseline and ﬁrst follow-up 
survey (immediate postintervention; 2.5 
months after baseline), respectively; and a $10 
gift card for completing the second follow-up 
survey (12 months after baseline). Parental 
consent and student assent were obtained 
before baseline. Students without parental 
consent participated in regular classroom 
activities. 
Of 1760 eligible students, 921 (52.3%) 
received parental consent (Figure 1). Of these, 
826 (89.7%) completed baseline surveys in 
early spring 2014. Of these, 736 (79.9%) 
completed ﬁrst follow-up surveys in late 
spring 2014, and 709 (77.0%) completed 
second follow-up surveys in spring 2015. 
Students in the follow-up sample were 
more likely to be male, younger, and His- 
panic. Attrition was nondifferential across 
conditions. 


tematic theory- and evidence-based in- 
structional design approach, to inform 
adaptation.34,35 As with IYG, Me & You is 
grounded in social–cognitive theories36,37 
and socioemotional learning,38 but also the 
socioecological model.39 We modiﬁed IYG 
objectives, which focused on promoting 
healthy relationships (in general) to explicitly 
address all unhealthy relationship behavior 
types (i.e., emotional, physical, sexual, cyber). 
Previous formative work28 and adolescent 
advisory board input informed program de- 
sign. To enhance relevance for the priority 
population, Me & You addressed surface- 
(e.g., music, settings, clothing) and deep- 
(e.g., respect for and inclusion of family, 
inclusion of ethnic-minority peer role models) 
structure cultural features.40 In addition, we 
included both genders as potential perpetra- 
tors and victims41 and gender-neutral names 
(when possible) to promote inclusivity. 
The student component comprises 13 
lessons that each last 25 minutes delivered by 
trained facilitators: 5 classroom (including 
interactive role plays, group discussion, and 
other skill-building activities), 5 individual 
computer only, and 3 classroom–computer 
blended (delivered in class, with some 
group-based computer activities). Computer 
activities included animations, peer video role 
modeling of skilled behaviors, interactive 
quizzes, and virtual role-play skills practice. 
Selected activities were tailored by user 
characteristics. For example, quizzes about 
communication provided tailored feedback 
based on users’ answers. During virtual 
role-plays, students selected their partner’s 
gender to increase relevance of activities to 
youths with same-gender partners. 

making paradigm (select, detect, 
protect),28,29,36,37 to promote healthy 
relationships in sixth grade. The goal was to 
increase skills for decision-making in re- 
lationships, understanding the consequences 
of one’s actions, and solving problems. 
Students were instructed to select personal 
rules to have healthy friendships and dating 
relationships, to detect signs and situations that 
could challenge rules, and to protect their rules. 
Additional topics (not included in IYG) 
covered modeling and skills practice for 
managing emotions and constructive com- 
munication skills, DV types and conse- 
quences, unfavorable norms toward violence, 
active consent, power differentials, gender- 
role stereotypes, general online safety, cyber 
DV, and sexting, and resources to leave un- 
healthy relationships. Lessons emphasized that 
skills could be applied to any current or future 
relationship (e.g., peers, dating partners, 
family) to ensure material was relevant to 
students not currently dating. The inter- 
vention emphasized perceived norms of 
students not needing a boyfriend or girlfriend. 
Sexual DV scenarios and activities were 
limited to age-appropriate presexual behav- 
iors (e.g., kissing, holding hands). 
Selected activities (e.g., managing emo- 
tions, consent, DV deﬁnitions, power dif- 
ferentials, cyber abuse) were pilot-tested with 
an adolescent advisory board comprising 15 
ethnically diverse (African American, Asian, 
and Hispanic) students (11 boys, 4 girls) to 
ensure language and scenarios were realistic 
and relevant to urban ethnic-minority 
youths.35 

child take-home activities and 2 parent 
newsletters. Take-home activities included 
interactive discussions to promote parent– 
child communication about dating expecta- 
tions, characteristics of healthy friendships and 
dating relationships, communication skills, 
and strategies for getting out of unhealthy 
relationships. Facilitators debriefed these 
take-home activities with students in class. 
Newsletters included tips, interactive games, 
and “ask-the-expert” Q&A. Topics included 
DV deﬁnitions, warning signs of unhealthy 
relationships, strategies for increasing DV 
awareness, enhancing parent–child commu- 
nication and connectedness, online safety, 
and linking parents to resources.

spring 2014. To ensure sufﬁcient teaching 
coverage, 8 research staff and 4 teachers were 
trained. The computer-based application was 
installed on intervention school computers. 
Research staff worked with school per- 
sonnel to identify subjects suitable for Me 
& You delivery (e.g., physical education, 
health, science). Before implementation, 
parents received passive consent forms. 
Comparison schools received their regular 
health education from the state-approved 
textbook; school contacts conﬁrmed that 
no comparison school received any 
evidence-based DV education. Inter- 
vention students received Me & You in- 
stead of regular health education when 
the curriculum was implemented in phys- 
ical education and health. 

Data were collected through computer- 
assisted self-interviews (no audio) on school 
computers during regular classes by using an 
Internet-based survey (Qualtrics, Qualtrics 
XM, Provo, Utah) hosted on a secure in- 
stitutional server. Data collectors were 
available for questions. 

We used the Conﬂict in Adolescent Da- 
ting and Relationship Inventory (CADRI)42 
to assess physical DV (4 items; e.g., “I threw 
something at him/her”), verbal or emo- 
tional DV (10 items; e.g., “I insulted him/ 
her with put-downs”), relational DV (3 
items; e.g., “I spread rumors about him/ 
her”), threatening behavior (4 items; e.g., 
“I threatened to hit him/her or throw 
something at him/her), and sexual DV (1 
item; “I kissed him/her when he/she did 
not want me to”). Per previous studies, 
“verbal/emotional DV” comprised verbal 
or emotional and relational DV subscales42 
and was labeled as “psychological” for this 
study. Only 1 sexual DV subscale item was 
used to match Me & You developmental 
content. The CADRI demonstrated ade- 
quate reliability (a > 0.70 for all subscales, 
with exception of threatening perpetration 
[a = 0.65]). Cyber DV perpetration and 
victimization were assessed with a 13-item 
scale (a > 0.80; e.g., “I posted embarras- 
sing photos or other images of him/her 
online”).43,44 
Participants were asked about lifetime 
exposure at baseline and past-12-months’ 
exposure at second follow-up. DV ques- 
tions were not asked at the ﬁrst follow-up, 
given insufﬁcient time for behavior 
change. DV questions were asked twice— 
related to perpetration and then victimi- 
zation—with dichotomous response op- 
tions (yes, no). Participants who indicated 
1 or more behaviors (i.e., physical, sexual, 
cyber) were classiﬁed as perpetrator or 
victim for that speciﬁc type. Because of its 
high prevalence, the threshold for psy- 
chological DV was higher (3 or more be- 
haviors).45 We created 2 DV composite 
variables (perpetration and victimization). 
Because the CADRI was originally tested 
among high-school students, items were 
pilot-tested with our adolescent advisory 
board to ensure comprehension with minor 
wording changes recommended (e.g., 
changing “deliberately” to “on purpose”). 
Primary dating violence outcomes. The pri- 
mary outcome measures were DV perpetra- 
tion and victimization in the total (dating and 
nondating) sample. DV was a dichotomous 
variable, categorized as participation in 1 or 
more DV types (physical, psychological, 
threatening, sexual, or cyber) versus no par- 
ticipation in any types. Only students who 
indicated ever having a boyfriend or girlfriend 
(deﬁned as “someone that you have dated, 
gone out with, or gone steady with”) an- 
swered DV questions. However, consistent 
with previous studies,46 and because the in- 
tervention emphasized perceived norms related 
to students (especially sixth graders) not needing 
a boyfriend or girlfriend, students who reported 
not ever having a boyfriend or girlfriend were 
coded as not having participated in any DV 
perpetration or victimization and were in- 
cluded in the primary outcome analysis. 
Secondary dating violence outcomes. Sec- 
ondary outcomes assessed impact on DV 
perpetration and victimization in the “dat- 
ing” sample, which comprised students who 
reported ever having a boyfriend or girl- 
friend. Furthermore, we assessed impact on 
each type (physical, emotional, threatening, 
cyber, or sexual) of DV perpetration and vic- 
timization for the total sample and dating sam- 
ple. We created dichotomous variables for 
each DV type (participation vs no participation). 

Using reliable and valid measures, we 
assessed theory-based36,39 determinants of 
DV including individual (norms toward boy- 
against-girl violence and girl-against-boy vi- 
olence,47,48 self-efﬁcacy to resolve conﬂict,49 
communication skills,47,50 attitudes toward 
sexting,51 belief in need for help,25 and cop- 
ing52,53), perceived peer DV, family (parent– 
child communication,54 closeness55), and 
community (social support56) psychosocial 
factors. Detailed measurement information is 
provided in the Appendix (available as a sup- 
plement to the online version of this article at 
http://www.ajph.org). 

To assess program coverage, facilitators 
completed attendance and ﬁdelity logs for 
each Me & You class to document imple- 
mentation, adaptations, and challenges. Stu- 
dents were asked to return a parental-signed 
activity slip following completion of each 
take-home activity. Attendance data were 
collected from 420 of 502 intervention stu- 
dents. Of these, approximately 70% received 
10 or more lessons (three quarters of all les- 
sons); 68% received at least 4 of 5 computer 
lessons. Fidelity logs indicated that ap- 
proximately 59% of lessons included all 
planned activities; 18% included some but 
not all planned activities, and 23% had in- 
complete ﬁdelity information. Low return 
rates for the take-home activity slips limited 
ﬁdelity data for this component. However, 
facilitator discussion of take-home activities 
occurred in 57% of appropriate lessons. Bud- 
getary constraints precluded process data col- 
lection from parents and school personnel.

Note. AOR = adjusted odds ratio; CI = conﬁdence interval; DV = dating violence. All models adjusted for baseline value of dependent variable, age, gender, race/ 
ethnicity, and time between assessments. DV was a dichotomous variable and categorized as participation in 1 or more DV types (physical, psychological, 
threatening, sexual, or cyber) versus no participation in any types. Dichotomous variables were created for each speciﬁc DV type (participation vs no 
participation).

bSample sizes reﬂect those used for the adjusted models and vary because of missing data. 
cUnadjusted percentages. 
adjusted for imbalances between study groups 
and potential confounding variables in all 
models. Student observations within the same 
school cannot be assumed to be independent. 
We used multilevel logistic and linear re- 
gression modeling to account for any intraclass 
correlation. Each model contained baseline 
measures of the dependent variable, where 
appropriate, adjusting for age, gender, race/ 
ethnicity, and time between assessments. We 
entered a dichotomous variable indicating 
treatment condition into each model to assess 
intervention effects. We used the Wald statistic 
(i.e., the ratio of the regression parameter to its 
standard error) to test for statistical signiﬁcance. 
Intraclass correlation coefﬁcients ranged from 
0.000 to 0.022 across outcomes. We analyzed 
primary and secondary DV outcomes at the 
second follow-up to allow time for behavior 
change; we analyzed psychosocial outcomes at 
ﬁrst and second follow-up. 

Table 1 describes baseline characteristics of 
the total and dating analytic samples. In the 
total sample, age, ever having a boyfriend or 
girlfriend, DV victimization, psychological DV 
perpetration and victimization, physical DV 
victimization, and 2 psychosocial variables were 
signiﬁcantly different across conditions. In the 
“dating” sample, age and 1 psychosocial variable 
were signiﬁcantly different. 

Among the total sample, odds of DV 
perpetration in the past 12 months were lower 
among intervention students than comparison 
students (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.46; 
95% conﬁdence interval [CI] = 0.28, 0.74; 
Table 2). However, odds of DV victimization 
were not signiﬁcantly different between con- 
ditions. Regarding speciﬁc DV types, odds of 
physical DV perpetration (AOR = 0.35; 95% 
CI = 0.19, 0.66), psychological DV perpetra- 
tion (OR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.41, 0.96), 
threatening DV perpetration (AOR = 0.33; 
95% CI = 0.15, 0.71) and victimization 
(AOR = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.17, 0.78), and sexual 
DV victimization (AOR = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.11, 
0.94) were lower among intervention 
students than comparison students. Among 
the dating sample, intervention effects were 
similar, except for psychological DV per- 
petration, threatening DV victimization, 
and sexual DV victimization. 

Among the total sample, at ﬁrst follow-up, 
intervention students reported less-favorable 
norms for boy-against-girl violence and girl- 
against-boy violence, greater constructive 
conﬂict-resolution skills, and more negative 
attitudes about sexting compared with com- 
parison students (Table 3). At second follow-up, 
intervention effects on norms toward boy- 
against-girl violence and girl-against-boy vio- 
lence remained statistically signiﬁcant. Among 
the dating sample, at ﬁrst follow-up, no psy- 
chosocial factors were statistically signiﬁcant; 
at second follow-up, norms for girl-against- 
boy violence were statistically signiﬁcant.

technology-enhanced DV prevention pro- 
gram for early middle-school students, in 
reducing DV perpetration and victimization. 
As hypothesized, odds of DV perpetration 
were signiﬁcantly lower among students who 
received Me & You than among students in 
the comparison group; however, odds of DV 
victimization were not signiﬁcantly different. 
Furthermore, there were signiﬁcant in- 
tervention effects on some speciﬁc types of 
DV perpetration and victimization, but no 
signiﬁcant effects on cyber DV perpetration 
and some other types of DV victimization. 
Moreover, there were signiﬁcant effects on 
several psychosocial variables. Collectively, 
these ﬁndings indicate Me & You as an ef- 
fective program to reduce DV, particularly 
perpetration and some types of victimization, 
among early adolescents. 
There are possible explanations for the 
positive effects of Me & You on DV per- 
petration and some types of DV victimization. 
First, Me & You includes 2 primary features 
from IYG—technology and a decision- 
making life-skills paradigm—that contrib- 
uted to the latter’s success.28,29 Systematic 
reviews have demonstrated the utility of 
technology-based programs for health edu- 
cation,57,58 suggesting that tailoring, simu- 
lated skills practice, and immediate feedback, 
all present in Me & You, are important 
technology components. To our knowledge, 
the only other effective technology-based 
DV program was developed for and evaluated 
among high-school students.59 In addition, 
Me & You uses a life-skills decision-making 
paradigm to enhance cognitive skills critical 
for developing healthy relationships.19 These 
skills also underlie the social–emotional 
learning framework, which has been shown 
to foster positive youth outcomes.38 Fur- 
thermore, most effects on DV perpetration 
were consistent across the total and dating 
samples reﬂecting the importance and rele- 
vance of teaching these skills for all students, 
regardless of dating status. 
Second, Me & You includes activities to 
reduce favorable norms toward violence and 
to improve conﬂict-resolution skills. Both 
factors, which are associated with reducing 
DV perpetration, particularly physical

You: Building Healthy Relationships, Southeast Texas, 2014 to 2015 

types,5,30–32 were affected by Me & You. 
Though we did not test mediation, it is 
possible these factors mediated the behavioral 
effects of Me & You, as reported for Safe 
Dates.25 Like Safe Dates, which also had an 
impact on physical DV perpetration, Me & 
You includes content related to managing 
emotions and reducing gender-role stereo- 
types. Deﬁcits in these skills have been linked 
to physical and combined (physical–emotional– 
sexual) DV perpetration.5,32,60 Furthermore, 
both boys and girls were presented as possible 
perpetrators, necessary messaging for DV 
prevention.61 
Third, Me & You includes parent–child 
activities designed to increase parent–child 
connectedness and communication, which 
are associated with reduced DV perpetration 
and victimization among youths,62 particu- 
larly Hispanic youths.63 It has been suggested 
that parents of early adolescents receive in- 
struction on effective communication to help 
their children prepare for dating.62 Although 
we do not know how many parents and 
children completed parent–child activities, 
ﬁdelity logs indicate that some students 
completed them with their parents. For those 
students, these activities would have afforded 
youths (and parents) the opportunity to 
practice communication and discuss how 
parents could support adolescents. Similar 
activities occur in Families for Safe Dates.26 
However, Me & You did not have an impact 
on parent–child communication and parental 
closeness; thus, the effect of this parental 
component merits further study. 
There are also possible explanations for the 
limited effects of Me & You on some speciﬁc 
DV types. Regarding cyber DV, Me & You 
deﬁned this DV type and included activities 
related to avoiding unsafe behaviors online. 
Although Me & You demonstrated positive 
short-term signiﬁcant effects on attitudes 
toward sexting, greater emphasis was placed 
on general safe technology use (e.g., sharing 
information online) than on avoiding unsafe 
technology behaviors with a dating partner. 
Given the prevalence of cyber DV,16 early 
adolescent DV programs should include 
skills-practice activities for avoiding cyber 
DV. 

were mixed: there was no impact on per- 
petration but a positive impact on victimi- 
zation. On the one hand, lack of impact on 
sexual DV perpetration may be attributable to 
limited emphasis on attitudes toward sexual 
aggression, which is associated with sexual 
DV perpetration.64 This omission was in- 
tentional because Me & You targets sixth 
graders. Thus, additional emphasis on these 
topics for early adolescents may be needed. 
On the other hand, impact on sexual DV 
victimization may result from inclusion of 
explicit discussion of active consent and skills 
training to help students ask for, and provide, 
active consent for intimate activities (e.g., 
holding hands, kissing).65,66 Furthermore, 
Me & You included activities that challenged 
traditional gender-role stereotypes, portray- 
ing both males and females as perpetrators 
and victims, which is necessary for reducing 
sexual DV victimization.25 Expect Respect, 
which also had an impact on sexual DV vic- 
timization (and perpetration), included similar 
activities.23 


First, generalizability may be limited to 
English-speaking students not enrolled in 
special education from a large urban school 
district. Second, though response rates are 
similar to those in other large urban samples,67 
the low response rate may have contributed 
some selection bias in that students who were 
more high-risk were less likely to return 
parental consent forms, also limiting gener- 
alizability. Third, although we used a widely 
used and validated measure of DV, measures 
are self-reported and, thus, may not capture all 
youth meanings of DV.68 Fourth, analyses 
revealed several pretreatment imbalances. 
However, we controlled for baseline values of 
all variables that were signiﬁcantly different 
between groups. Fifth, some missing and 
incomplete attendance and ﬁdelity data 
limited our ability to assess student exposure 
to all intervention components. Finally, we 
relied more on research staff compared with 
school teachers for program implementation. 
However, similar to other in-person facili- 
tator programs, this intervention could be 
scaled up with appropriate training and 
resources. 



experiencing DV. Subsequently, these youths 
need effective, innovative multilevel inter- 
ventions to develop cognitive skills neces- 
sary for the formation of healthy dating 
relationships. Our ﬁndings indicate that Me 
& You, a multilevel, technology-enhanced 
DV prevention program that provides these 
critical life skills, is effective in reducing DV 
perpetration and decreasing some forms of 
DV victimization in early middle-school 
ethnic-minority students. Future studies are 
needed to formally assess mediation pathways 
and moderating effects, particularly by gender 
and race/ethnicity.
