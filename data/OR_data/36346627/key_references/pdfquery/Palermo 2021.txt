Effects of Government-Implemented 
Cash Plus Model on Violence 
Experiences and Perpetration Among 
Adolescents in Tanzania, 2018–2019 




Methods. We used data from a cluster randomized controlled trial (n 5 130 communities) conducted in 
the Mbeya and Iringa regions of Tanzania to isolate impacts of the “plus” components of the cash plus 
intervention. The panel sample comprised 904 adolescents aged 14 to 19 years living in households 


Results. The plus intervention reduced female participants’ experiences of sexual violence by 5 
percentage points and male participants’ perpetration of physical violence by 6 percentage points. There 
were no intervention impacts on emotional violence, physical violence, or help seeking. Examining 






reaches some of the most vulnerable and marginalized adolescents. (Am J Public Health. 2021;111(12):

Intermediate pathways examined 
included age at ﬁrst sexual intercourse,

Age-disparate sexual relationship was 
deﬁned as having a sexual partner 5 or 
more years older, in line with previous 
studies.34 Self-perceived stress was 
measured using the Enhanced Life Dis- 


































zation (WHO) Multi-country Study on 
Women’s Health and Domestic Vio- 
lence,30 which draws on the Conﬂict 
Tactics Scale.31 We adapted these 
items to include any perpetrator (not 














tress across multiple areas of social life 
and functioning35 and results in an 
overall scale ranging from 0 to 39 and 3 


relationships). We measured self- 
efﬁcacy by using a locus-of-control 
index36,37 and self-esteem by using 2 
items from Rosenberg’s self-esteem 
scale.38 For time use, we examined par- 
ticipation in 5 types of economic activi- 
ties performed in the past 7 days (farm 
work, livestock herding, ﬁshing, nonagri- 
cultural business, paid work outside the

were collected: baseline (April–June

aThe sexual violence indicator included in this table differs from those used in impacts analyses in Tables 2 and 3 because of a skip pattern error at 
baseline, whereby only adolescents who reported having had sexual intercourse were asked questions about sexual violence. In subsequent waves, all 
youths in the violence module were asked questions about sexual violence, which may include other forced sexual acts.

namely, participation in livestock herd-

may, in part, explain why we found pro-

reductions in other violence-related 
outcomes among children and adoles- 
cents.10 These studies are not in con-

interventions studied were different 
(cash transfers vs “plus” components). 
Other studies examining effects of cash

this is a key window to model equitable

because of the sensitive nature of this

underscore that context matters in

round 3 ﬁeldwork, households experi- 
enced a delay in PSSN payments for 
the ﬁrst time, and this may have miti- 
gated impacts of the cash plus pro-

of selling them for a proﬁt. Some pro-

inﬂuenced choices. Another study from

Ethics approval for the study was granted by the 
National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR/ 
HQ/R.8a/Vol.IX/2784) and the Tanzania Commis- 
sion for Science and Technology. Informed assent 
and parental consent were obtained for all 
unmarried adolescents aged 14 to 17 years, and 
written informed consent was obtained directly 
for those aged 18 and 19 years and married ado- 
lescents aged 15 to 17 years. There were no mar- 
ried adolescents younger than 15 years, which 
was the legal age of marriage in Tanzania for girls.
