Abstract We aimed to investigate whether the Good School 
Toolkit reduced emotional violence, severe physical violence, 
sexual violence and injuries from school staff to students, as well 
as emotional, physical and sexual violence between peers, in 
Ugandan primary schools. We performed a two-arm cluster 
randomised controlled trial with parallel assignment. Forty-two 
schools in one district were allocated to intervention (n = 21) or 
wait-list control (n = 21) arms in 2012. We did cross-sectional 
baseline and endline surveys in 2012 and 2014, and the Good 
School Toolkit intervention was implemented for 18 months be- 
tween surveys. Analyses were by intention to treat and are ad- 
justed for clustering within schools and for baseline school-level 
proportions of outcomes. The Toolkit was associated with an 
overall reduction in any form of violence from staff and/or peers 
in the past week towards both male (aOR = 0.34, 95%CI 0.22– 
0.53) and female students (aOR = 0.55, 95%CI 0.36–0.84). 
Injuries as a result of violence from school staff were also lower 
in male (aOR = 0.36, 95%CI 0.20–0.65) and female students 
(aOR = 0.51, 95%CI 0.29–0.90). Although the Toolkit seems to 
be effective at reducing violence in both sexes, there is some 
suggestion that the Toolkit may have stronger effects in boys 
than girls. The Toolkit is a promising intervention to reduce a 
wide range of different forms of violence from school staff and

Violence is one of the most pervasive and serious public health 
problems facing children globally. Physical, sexual and emo- 
tional violence, as well as neglect, have a range of short and 
longer term health consequences, including increased risk of 
mental disorders (Norman et al. 2012), suicide (Devries et al. 
2014b), sexually transmitted infections (Norman et al. 2012) 
and poor educational attainment (Boden et al. 2007). In most 
contexts, girls and boys have different risks and experiences of 
these forms of violence, with boys in some settings being more 
likely to experience physical violence (Akmatov 2010), and 
girls being more likely to experience sexual violence 
(Stoltenborgh et al. 2011). In East Africa, the school environ- 
ment may be a main location where exposure to various forms 
of violence occurs, from both school staff and from peers 
(UNICEF Tanzania, Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, & Muhimbili University of Health and Allied 
Sciences 2011; United Nations Children’s Fund Kenya 


Country Office 2012). In Uganda, despite the prohibition of 
corporal punishment at school, anecdotal evidence indicates 
that most teachers continue to believe that pain is the only 
effective motivator for learning. This situation is exacerbated 
with large classroom sizes and inadequate training on how to 
engage attention of students. We previously found that more 
than 90% of students had experienced violence at school and 
more than 50% had experienced it last week (Devries et al. 
2014a). 
Relatively few interventions to prevent any form of child 
maltreatment have been tested in low- and middle-income coun- 
tries, and fewer still focus on the school environment. The Good 
School Toolkit, developed by Ugandan NGO Raising Voices, 
takes a whole school approach to violence prevention and aims 
to change culture at the school level to promote respect, partic- 
ipation and reflection on concepts and exercise of power. We 
recently reported that the Good Schools Toolkit can reduce phys- 
ical violence from school staff to primary school students 
(Devries et al. 2015). To our knowledge, no other interventions 
to prevent violence from school staff to students have been rig- 
orously evaluated. We also found evidence of a sex difference in 
the effect of the Toolkit—although it was effective for both 
sexes, our analysis suggests (Devries et al. 2015) that it was more 
effective reducing physical violence from school staff towards 
boys (OR = 0.34, 95%CI 0.21–0.56), than girls (OR = 0.46, 
95%CI 0.29–0.74), p value for interaction 0.043. 
In this paper, we took a more comprehensive look at the 
effects of the Good School Toolkit on other forms of violence 
in the school environment and explored whether the effects 
are different for boys and girls. Specifically, we explored the 
effects on (1) combined exposure to violence in the school 
environment from school staff and peers, (2) severe physical 
violence from school staff towards students, injuries among 
students inflicted by school staff, emotional and sexual vio- 
lence from school staff, and which specific acts of physical 
violence from school staff were impacted by the intervention, 
and (3) emotional, physical and sexual violence from peers 
towards students. We also examined reports of physical and 
emotional violence from school staff for evidence of replace- 
ment of one form of violence with another—that is, a reduc- 
tion in staff use of physical violence with a simultaneous in- 
crease in staff use of emotional violence against students. 

The Good Schools Study (Devries et al. 2013) is registered at 
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01678846) and was approved by the 
LSHTM Ethics Committee (6183) and the Uganda National 
Council for Science and Technology (SS2520). Further details 
about our methodology are published elsewhere (Devries et al. 
2013, 2015). 

Forty-two primary schools in Luwero District, Uganda, were 
included in the study. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted 
at schools in June/July 2012 and June/July 2014. The inter- 
vention was implemented over 18 months, between 
September/October 2012 and April/May 2014. 

We carried out a two-arm cluster-randomised controlled trial 
with parallel assignment. Using the official 2010 list of all 268 
primary schools in Luwero as our sampling frame, we exclud- 
ed 105 schools with fewer than 40 registered primary 5 stu- 
dents and 20 schools with existing governance interventions. 
Forty-two schools were randomly selected and all agreed to 
participate in the study. Schools did not receive any induce- 
ment or incentive for participation (other than receiving the 
Toolkit intervention). Parents were informed that the study 
would be taking place and could opt their children out. 
Children themselves provided consent. 
Current lists of all primary school grade 5, 6 and 7 students 
(aged about 11–14 years) were obtained from each school, and 
a simple random sample of up to 130 students from the lists 
was invited to participate. In schools with fewer than 130 P5– 
7 students, all students were invited for an interview. All those 
who could speak Luganda or English and who were deemed 
by interviewers to be able to understand the consent proce- 
dures were eligible. The flow of participants through the trial 
is described elsewhere (Devries et al. 2015). 

The Good School Toolkit is a complex intervention which 
aims to foster change of operational culture at the school level, 
developed by the Ugandan NGO Raising Voices (Devries 
et al. 2015). The Toolkit is publicly available at www. 
raisingvoices.org. Briefly, the Toolkit consists of six steps 
designed to be implemented in sequence and draws on the 
Transtheoetical Model of behaviour change (Prochaska and 
Velicer 1997). The steps contain more than 60 different activ- 
ities for staff, students and administration, focused around 
topics such as improving the school compound and creating 
a better learning environment, respect and understanding 
power relationships, improving teaching techniques, creating 
accountability, and learning non-violent methods of disci- 
pline. These are delivered by two staff and two student ‘pro- 
tagonists’, who are chosen at the outset of the intervention to 
lead processes at each school. The protagonists receive ongo- 
ing support from Raising Voices staff. The intervention activ- 
ities contain a number of established behaviour change tech- 
niques (Abraham and Michie 2008) such as setting goals, 
making action plans, rewards and reinforcement, and

crucially, because it works with multiple actors within the 
school setting simultaneously, it creates social support for 
change. Schools not receiving the Toolkit were wait-listed to 
do so. 
they could stop the interview at any time, and interviewers 
were trained to stop or take a break if a student became dis- 
tressed during the interview. All children were offered 
counselling regardless of what they disclosed. 


The 21 intervention schools completed the Good School 
Toolkit intervention during the 18-month implementation pe- 
riod. Appointed protagonists and head teachers from all 
schools participated in the Toolkit initiation training. 
Although the Toolkit six steps were completed in all schools, 
Raising Voices programme implementers reported that the 
quality and/or adoption of the steps did vary between schools. 
Raising Voices technical school support visits took place at the 
planned frequency in all schools, with an average of two sup- 
port visits per school term of Toolkit implementation. 

Measures are derived from the International Society for the 
Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Child Abuse 
Screening Tool-Child Institutional (ICAST-CI) (International 
Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect 2006) 
(reported in Table 1). The ICAST has been used extensively 
and validated in a variety of settings internationally. Measures 
were translated where necessary, and some items and time 
frames for recall added to capture the Ugandan context. All 
were pretested for understanding and piloted before the base- 
line survey (Devries et al. 2013). 

Interviewers collected data from students, during baseline and 
endline cross-sectional surveys, in one-on-one interviews con- 
ducted within sight but out of earshot of others at the school. 
As literacy levels were low in schools, questionnaires were 
programmed into mobile phones or tablet computers and read 
aloud to students; interviewers entered responses. Students 
could complete the interview in either Luganda or English. 
The survey took about 45 min. Students were advised that 
In this study, potential risks related to the intervention itself 
were minimal, but during survey data collection, we detected 
children in need of support from child protective services be- 
cause they had experienced abuse. Children were informed 
during the consent process that their details might be passed 
on to child protection officers. Referrals were based on 
predefined criteria agreed with service providers, related to 
the severity and timing of violence reported (Child et al. 
2014; Devries et al. 2015. 

Allowing for a loss to follow-up of two schools per arm, and 
conservatively assuming interviews with 60 students per 
school, with a prevalence of past week physical violence of 
50% and an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.06 (from 
our baseline survey) (Devries et al. 2014a), we had 80% 
power to detect a 13% difference in the prevalence of reported 
violence between the intervention and control arms with 5% 
statistical significance. 

Stratified block randomisation was done (Devries et al. 2015). 
Due to the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to 
mask participants. Given the nature of the intervention, inter- 
viewers should also be considered unmasked. 

We performed an intention to treat analysis using data from 
our cross-sectional follow-up survey. All analyses were per- 
formed in Intercooled Stata 13.1 (Stata Corp 2014). Data were 


collected using a survey programmed into tablet computers 
with algorithms designed to eliminate erroneous skips. 
Analysis was performed using individual-level student data, 
accounting for clustering of students within schools using 
mixed effects regression models. Adjusted analyses are pre- 
sented and control for baseline school-level means of the vio- 
lence outcome (modelled as a continuous variable), whether 
or not students had a disability, their school’s location (urban 
or rural). To explore possible sex differences in effects of the 
Toolkit on violence outcomes, interaction terms were fitted 
(sex with study arm), and adjusted models with and without 
interaction terms were compared using Likelihood ratio tests. 
Stratum specific odds ratios for boys and girls are calculated 
based on models with interaction terms. 

Student characteristics were evenly distributed across study 
arms at baseline (Table 2). At baseline, students were 13 years 
old, on average, about 7% had some form of disability (most 
commonly difficulties with sight, followed by hearing), and 
less than half had eaten three meals on the previous day. About 
19% of boys reported working more than 2 h a day outside of 
school, and about 15% of girls reported the same. Most stu- 
dents walked to school with someone they know. 

The prevalence of violence in school was very high, with 60% or 
more students reporting some form of violence in the past week 
(Table 2). Past week staff physical violence was far more com- 
monly reported than peer physical violence in this sample; for 
emotional violence, both boys and girls reported higher levels of 
peer perpetration. Between 25 and 30% of boys and girls report- 
ed some form of injury from school staff in the past week, with 
girls slightly more commonly reporting moderate injuries. 
Sexual violence was less commonly reported relative to other 
forms of violence, although case numbers are still very high 
considering the past week time frame of reporting. For boys, 
outcome variables were balanced across arms, but for girls, there 
was some suggestion that violence outcomes were more com- 
mon in the control versus intervention arms. 

Forty-two schools participated in the baseline and 
endline survey, and 92.3% (n = 3820) of sampled stu- 
dents were interviewed at endline. The flow of partici- 
pants through the trial is described in Fig. 1. The quan- 
tity of missing data was low (<3%) and similar across 
study groups for all measures presented. 
Intervention Effects on Combined Violence from Staff 
and Peers in the School Environment 
The intervention was associated with a reduction in overall 
levels of ‘any’ form of violence (physical, emotional, sexual 
combined) from school staff and/or peers, over both the past 
week and past term time frames (Table 3). The magnitude of 
the reduction was larger in boys than girls over both time 
frames, with strong evidence of a statistically significant inter- 
action effect by sex. Considering any form of violence from 
school staff, there was a reduction in intervention schools for 
both boys and girls over the past week and past term time 
frames; again, the magnitude of the reduction was larger for 
boys than for girls. Students in the Toolkit intervention 
schools displayed significantly lower peer violence over the 
past week and past term, but there was no evidence of a dif- 
ferential effect for boys relative to girls. 
Intervention Effects on Violence from Staff Towards 
Students 
In general, fewer students in the intervention arm relative to 
the control arm reported emotional violence; this association 
was not statistically significant over the past week, but was 
significant over the past term (Table 4). There was no evidence 
of a differential effect in boys and girls. The most commonly 
reported specific acts of emotional violence were being 
cursed, insulted, shouted at or humiliated. 
Students in the intervention arm reported less physical vi- 
olence from school staff over the past week and past term 
(Table 5). Statistically significant reductions were reported 
by both boys and girls, but the magnitude of the reduction 
was larger in boys than girls. This was mainly driven by a 
reduction in caning, which was the most common act of phys- 
ical violence from school staff reported by both boys and girls 
in the past week. There were also significant past week reduc- 
tions in being slapped on the face or head, and being hit by 
having an object thrown at you. 
There was a borderline significant reduction in severe physi- 
cal violence from school staff in the past week, which reached 
statistical significance over the past term time frame. This was 
mainly driven by a reduction in being ‘severely beaten up’. 
There was no evidence of a differential effect between girls 
and boys, but case numbers were relatively low. In terms of 
sexual violence, the number of reported cases where school staff 
were the perpetrators over the past week and past term was few 
in number, and no clear pattern of effect emerged (Table 6).

(Table 7). The magnitude of the reduction is higher in 
boys than girls over the past term time frame (signifi- 
cant interaction effect). Moderate injuries were also low- 
er in Toolkit intervention school students over the past 
week and past 
term, again with evidence of slightly 
higher effects in boys than girls. There was no evidence 
of a reduction in severe injuries in the intervention ver- 
sus control arm over the past term timeframe (and too 
few cases to estimate effects over the past week time 
frame). Reductions in injury were driven mainly by re- 
duced reporting of pain and swelling. 

Student reports of emotional violence from peers over 
the past week and past term were lower in the interven- 
tion arm, with no evidence of any difference in effect in 
boys and girls (Table 8). Peer physical violence over the 



past week was not statistically significantly different be- 
tween control and intervention arms; however, the asso- 
ciation approached borderline statistical significance 
over the past 
term time frame. There was also some 
suggestion of a potential interaction over the past term 
time frame, which did not reach statistical significance 
but where effects were more pronounced in boys than 
girls. Case numbers of peer sexual violence over the 
past week and past term were low, but results suggest 
the intervention was associated with a borderline 
that 
increase in reports of sexual violence for girls in partic- 
ular, over both time frames, although this did not reach 
statistical significance. 

Children who were in schools that used the Toolkit experi- 
enced reduced odds of a range of different forms of violence in 
the school environment—severe physical violence and injury 
from school staff, emotional violence from school staff, 
emotional violence from peers and probably for boys, physical 
violence from peers. Our exploratory analyses suggest that 
some of the effects on various forms of violence of the 
Toolkit are larger in boys versus girls. For sexual violence, 
there was some suggestion that the use of the Toolkit was 
associated with an increase in reports of cases of peer sexual 
violence among girls, but case numbers are low and this find- 
ing should be interpreted with caution. 
The Toolkit represents one of the first interventions that has 
shown promise to successfully reduce physical and emotional 
violence from both school staff and peers in the school envi- 
ronment. The Toolkit is designed to be a holistic, comprehen- 
sive intervention which changes school culture. Our results 
are consistent with the limited number of studies which have 
tested whole school interventions to reduce students’ aggres- 
sive behaviour and improving social interaction outcomes, 
reviewed by Bonnell et al. (Bonell et al. 2013). However, 
reviewed studies are from high-income contexts, and none 
of the interventions included in this review examined effects 
separately by sex, so it is unknown to what extent they were 
effectively reaching both boys and girls (Bonell et al. 2013). 
Ttofi and Farrington also reviewed school-based anti-bullying 
programs and found that more intensive programs, programs 
which included parent meetings, firm disciplinary methods 
and improved supervision of children, were more effective 
in reducing bullying versus those without and programs work- 
ing with peers were actually harmful (Ttofi and Farrington 
2011). Sex differences were also not examined in this review, 
so any differential effects for boys and girls are unclear (Ttofi 
and Farrington 2011). 
The suggestion of an increase in sexual violence reports by 
girls in intervention schools could have several interpretations 
and is an area where further exploration is required. A worry- 
ing but unlikely possibility is that the reduction in harsh pun- 
ishments from staff towards boys has removed a deterrent 
preventing sexual aggression from boys towards female stu- 
dents. However, if harsh punishment from staff was acting as a 
deterrent for peer violence which has now been removed as a 
result of the intervention, then we might reasonably expect an 
increase in all forms of peer violence. Instead, the data show 
reductions in peer violence. A more plausible explanation for 
the increase in girls’ reports of sexual violence is that the 
intervention has created an environment where they feel more 
able to disclose their experiences. The Toolkit is associated 
with increased feelings of safety and well-being in school 
(Devries et al. 2015), and it does contain activities which 
support schools to improve their internal systems to deal with 
disclosures. 
It remains unclear why there may be sex differences 
in the effects of the Toolkit—the Toolkit explicitly en- 
courages equal participation of girls and boys in student 
activities, although there is no separate or dedicated 
module on encouraging gender equality. The lesser ef- 
fect in girls may reflect the degree to which they par- 
ticipate in the intervention or could also reflect compet- 
ing pressures and other experiences outside the school— 
in this context, prevailing gender norms dictate that 
girls bear responsibility for household duties and caring 
for younger siblings (Evans 2012), which may take up a 
large amount of time, possibly increasing absenteeism 
and tiredness and concentration difficulties. This may 
limit the ability of girls to effectively participate in in- 
tervention activities. However, boys are also often re- 
sponsible for household tasks such as fetching water 
and carrying wood (Evans 2012), so this potential link 
needs further investigation. Girls also may be more ex- 
posed to other forms of violence outside the school 
environment, which might 
interact with their exposure 
to violence inside school (Devries et al. 2014a). 
Corporal punishment takes place in schools for a va- 
riety of reasons, including as discipline in response to 
fighting between peers, non-compliance or misbehaviour 
in class, lateness, poor grades, lack of attention or poor 
performance in class (Breen et al. 2015; Malak et al. 


























































































2015). Some of these ‘reasons’, for example, violence 
between peers, seem to have been reduced more in 
boys. This may have led to a knock-on effect of also 
further reducing staff violence against boys. If girls, on 
the other hand, are punished more often for inattention 
or lateness, these might be less amenable to a school- 
based intervention and more influenced by the social 
and economic realities faced by families in this context. 
Further investigation is needed. 

Our study has a number of strengths, and of course, some 
limitations. This analysis is exploratory, and we have limited 
power to detect sex differences in the effects of the Toolkit. The 
specific acts of violence reported are single-item measures and 
are therefore subject to limitations associated with use of 
single-item measures, such as unknown biases in interpretation 
and random measurement error. We have also conducted a 
large number of statistical tests, thus increasing the likelihood 
that some findings will be due to chance. Therefore, findings 
should be considered in terms of consistency of trends and 
plausibility of results. We used valid, reliable instruments to 
measure exposure to violence, which are widely used interna- 
tionally; we also pretested and piloted measures prior to use. 
Similar to other studies on violence, all of these measures are 
self-report. We intentionally chose student reports of experi- 
ence of violence, rather than staff reports of perpetration, as 
the more conservative measure of intervention effect. We 
trained interviewers extensively in non-judgemental data col- 
lection techniques; however, it is still likely that more 
stigmatised forms of violence, such as sexual violence, are 
under-reported. This represents some of the first rigorous data 
collected on this topic in Uganda and in the region, and adds to 
our understanding of how the only rigorously evaluated inter- 
vention to reduce violence from school staff towards students is 
working, and where it could be further strengthened. 

Despite the encouraging overall effects in both boys and girls, 
the overall levels of violence experienced by these primary 
school students remain extremely high. Further work is ur- 
gently needed to investigate ways to further reduce this vio- 
lence and to augment this intervention so that it is even more 
effective. The Toolkit is a promising intervention to reduce a 
range of forms of violence against children in schools and is 
seen to be effective for both boys and girls. Additional re- 
search is needed to understand why it is more effective in boys 
versus girls and to understand how it could be strengthened to 
further reduce school violence against girls in particular.
