The Safe Dates Project is a randomized trial for evaluating a school-based adolescent dating
violence prevention program. Five waves of data were used to examine the effects of Safe
Dates over time including primary and secondary prevention effects, moderators, and mediators of program effects. Using random coefficients models, with multiple imputation of
missing data, significant program effects were found at all four follow-up periods on psychological, moderate physical, and sexual dating violence perpetration and moderate physical
dating violence victimization. Marginal effects were found on sexual victimization. Effects on
severe physical perpetration at all four follow-up periods were moderated by prior involvement in that type of violence. Primary and secondary prevention effects were found and the
program was equally effective for males and females and for whites and non-whites. Program
effects were mediated by changes in dating violence norms, gender-role norms, and awareness of community services.

INTRODUCTION

Adolescent dating violence is prevalent and results in serious physical, psychological, and developmental consequences (Avery-Leaf et al., 1997;
Bergman, 1992; Coker et al., 2000; Foshee, 1996;
Malik et al., 1997; O’Keefe & Treister, 1998;
O’Keeffe et al., 1986; Silverman et al., 2001). The
Safe Dates Project is a randomized controlled trial
for testing the effects of a school-based interven

tion on the primary and secondary prevention of
adolescent dating violence victimization and perpetration. For the trial, 14 public schools in a
North Carolina county with eighth or ninth grades
were stratified by grade and matched on school
size. One member of each matched pair was randomly assigned to either receive Safe Dates or to
serve as a control. Adolescents in treatment and
control groups completed questionnaires in school
at baseline and then again in 1 month, 1 year,
2 years, 3 years, and 4 years after the program was
completed.
Findings reported earlier suggested that 1 month
after the intervention, Safe Dates prevented and
reduced psychological abuse perpetration, reduced
sexual dating violence perpetration, and positively
changed cognitive mediating variables that were
based on program content, such as dating violence norms, gender-role norms, conflict management skills, and awareness of community services
for dating violence (Foshee et al., 1998). One year

after the intervention, cognitive risk factor effects
were maintained, but behavioral effects disappeared
(Foshee et al., 2000). Additional analyses assessed
longer-term (4 years post-intervention) effects and
a booster intervention with a sub-sample of our respondents (Foshee et al., 2004).
The analyses assessing 1-month and 1-year
follow-up effects were limited by the analytical strategy used to assess program effects. Mean outcome
scores were calculated for each school by aggregating
adolescent responses. The nonparametric Wilcoxon
signed rank test was used to determine if the mean
outcome scores for the treatment and control schools
in each matched pair (N = 7) were significantly
different. That analytical approach had several drawbacks. One is that with only seven matched pairs,
there were few degrees of freedom for comparisons,
resulting in low power (Murray & Hannah, 1989).
Power was further limited because we assessed primary and secondary prevention effects by segmenting the sample into sub-samples based on the adolescent’s level of involvement in dating violence prior to
intervention. As a result, in some of the sub-samples,
especially the secondary prevention sub-samples,
school-level mean outcome scores were based on a
small number of respondent’s scores. Other limitations were the inability to directly control for covariates, making it impossible to determine if program
effects were mediated by the proposed theoretical
variables that were the foci of the program, and a loss
of information due to the aggregation of responses.
The analyses assessing the effects of Safe Dates 4years after the intervention showed positive program
effects on dating violence, but those analyses were restricted to the eighth grade cohort and did not assess
proposed mediators of program effects. Additionally, in all earlier analyses, missing data were dealt
with by listwise deletion, which can decrease power,
produce biased estimates, and inflate standard errors
(Patrician, 2002).
In this study, we extend our earlier work by
(1) using four waves of follow-up data, assessing
program effects up to 3 years post-intervention, (2)
employing a different analytical strategy—random
coefficient regression modeling, and (3) using
multiple imputation procedures (Rubin, 1987) to
account for missing data due to attrition. Using these
procedures we (1) examine the effects of Safe Dates
over time in preventing and reducing psychological,
moderate physical, severe physical, and sexual dating
violence victimization and perpetration, (2) determine if program effects over time are due to primary


or secondary prevention by testing whether program
effects are moderated by the adolescent’s involvement in dating violence prior to the intervention, (3)
determine if program effects over time are moderated by gender and race, and (4) determine whether
the relationships between treatment condition and
dating violence outcomes at each wave are explained by theoretically based, time-dependent,
mediating variables that were the program
foci.
Random coefficient modeling is appropriate for
addressing study purposes because it allows for (1)
assessing the effects of the intervention over time
while considering and controlling for variation within
individuals and correlated responses within schools
over time, and (2) simultaneous modeling of covariates, such as mediators and moderators, without segmenting the sample. Missing data, common
to longitudinal studies, can threaten both internal
and external validity of randomized trials (Figueredo
_et al., 2000). Recent computational advances allowed_
us to use multiple imputation procedures proposed
by Rubin (1987) for filling in missing data. Multiple imputation procedures allow researchers to use
available data to impute values that approximate
the “real” value, while preserving the uncertainty
of missing values and aspects of data distribution
(Patrician, 2002; Schafer, 1999). Simulation exercises
have demonstrated that the test statistics produced
from data sets with missing values filled in using multiple imputation procedures were closer to the test
statistics produced from complete data sets than were
the test statistics produced from data sets that dealt
with missing values with listwise deletion (Horton &
Lipsitz, 2001; Patrician, 2002). Also, multiple imputation procedures are not hampered by the disadvantages of commonly used single imputation procedures, such as mean or median substitution, that
can underestimate standard errors and bias parameter estimates (Patrician, 2002).
Despite the prevalence and negative consequences of adolescent dating violence and date
rape, only a few evaluations of prevention programs designed to reduce those behaviors have
been published. Nearly all used designs without
random assignment to experimental and control
groups (Avery-Leaf et al., 1997; Jaffe et al., 1992;
Jones, 1991; Krajewski et al., 1996; Lavoie et al.,
1995; Weisz & Black, 2001) and measured attitudes,
knowledge, and/or intentions, but not behavior
(Avery-Leaf et al., 1997; Jaffe et al., 1992; Jones, 1991;
Krajewski et al., 1996; Lavoie et al., 1995; Macgowan,

1997; Weisz & Black, 2001). The only study other
than ours to use a randomized design and measure
dating violence behaviors was conducted by Wolfe
and associates (2003). Their evaluation differs from
ours in that a community—rather than a schoolbased program was evaluated, teens with a history
of child maltreatment rather than the general population of adolescents were targeted, and intervention effects were assessed only through 2 years of
follow-up.

METHODS

Design

Adolescents were eligible for the study if they
were enrolled in the eighth or ninth grade in the
fall of 1994 in one of the 14 public schools in a
primarily rural county of North Carolina. The 14
schools were stratified by grade (eighth or ninth)
and then matched on school size. One school from
each matched pair was randomly assigned to treatment and the other to control conditions. Baseline
data (wave 1) were collected in schools by trained
research staff in October 1994 from 81% (n = 1885)
of eligible adolescents. The adolescents in the seven
treatment schools were exposed to Safe Dates program activities from November 1994 through March
1995. Safe Dates included a play performed by students, a curriculum of ten 45-minute sessions taught
by health and physical education teachers, and a
poster contest based on curriculum content. Based
on monitoring data, 97% of the students enrolled
in the Safe Dates schools were present for the play;
the teachers covered 90.7% of the curriculum activities; and classroom attendance across sessions
ranged from 95.0 to 97.0%. All students who were
in school on the day of their school’s poster contest
were exposed to the messages in the posters because
each student was required to vote for the three best
posters in the school.
Follow-up data were collected from treatment
and control adolescents 1 month (wave 2), 1 year
(wave 3), 2 years (wave 4), 3 years (wave 5), and 4
years (wave 6) after Safe Dates was completed using
the same procedures as for baseline data collection.
Students who were absent for school data collection, including those who had dropped out of school,
were mailed a questionnaire and 50% of those questionnaires were completed and returned. Across all
follow-up waves, between 4 and 9% of the students


completed questionnaires by mail. After wave 4, a
random half of the adolescents who had been in
the original treatment group were mailed a booster
newsletter followed by a telephone call from a health
educator.
The analyses for this paper are limited to adolescents who completed a baseline questionnaire and
who were in either the original control group or
the treatment group that received Safe Dates but
not the booster (n = 1566). We eliminated boostergroup adolescents because the focus of this paper
is on evaluating the effects of Safe Dates, and not
the booster, over-time. There were no significant differences on the baseline measures of dating abuse
victimization and perpetration between adolescents
who received Safe Dates only and those who received Safe Dates and the booster. For these analyses
we use data from waves 1 through 5. Wave 6 data are
not used because the ninth grade cohort had graduated from high school by then and therefore wave 6
data were not collected from them. Of the 1566 adolescents in our analyses, 1130 (72.2%) are white and
733 (46.8%) are males. The mean age at baseline was
13.9 years. Of the 1566, 636 (40.6%) are in the treatment group and 930 (59.4%) are in the control group.
The imbalance in treatment and control group numbers is due to exclusion of adolescents who received
the booster.

The Safe Dates Program

The Safe Dates program activities targeted behavioral outcomes through theoretically based mediating variables as shown in Fig. 1. Preventing the onset of dating violence victimization and perpetration
indicates primary prevention and promoting cessation of dating violence victimization and perpetration
indicates secondary prevention.
Changes in norms coupled with improvements
in conflict management skills served as the theoretical base for primary prevention activities. Norms are
instruments of social control and thus have a significant effect on behavior and conformity (Mizruchi &
Perrucci, 1962). Norms are indicated by perceptions
of the sanctions associated with a behavior (Solomon
& Harford, 1984). Observed sanctions have more
impact on an individual’s perceptions of the norms
when they are levied by someone important to the individual and for whom they have high motivation to
comply (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975). For adolescents,
peers are a primary source of normative influence.

Fig. 1. Safe Dates conceptual model.


Several studies suggest that adolescents perceive few
negative sanctions from their peers for dating violence (see Hotaling & Sugarman, 1986) and that
acceptance of dating violence, which may indicate
the norms associated with dating violence, is one of
the strongest correlates of dating violence (Bergman,
1992; Deal & Wampler, 1986; O’Keeffe et al., 1986).
Program activities were designed to alter dating violence norms by increasing the adolescent’s perception of negative consequences associated with dating
violence and altering peer responses to dating violence.
Norms related to gender-roles also provide a
framework for selecting future behaviors. According
to cognitive-developmental theories, children form
gender-role norms and then, as adolescents, they
strive to become like the categories they created
(Bem, 1981). Perceived gender-role norms have been
found to influence many different adolescent behaviors, including academic performance, later career
choices, and thus later income (Tallichet & Willits,
1986; Worell, 1982), likelihood of using contraceptives (Resnick & Blum, 1985), and sexual behavior
(Foshee & Bauman, 1992). Traditional gender role
norms put females in a submissive position relative to
males and males in positions of power and authority.
Acceptance of traditional gender-role expectations
has been associated with the use of violence by males
towards partners (Check & Malamuth, 1983; Finn,
1986) and with the likelihood of females remaining in
an abusive relationship (Finn, 1986). Program activities were designed to decrease adolescent acceptance
of traditional gender-role norms.
Violent couples report using faulty conflict management techniques (Lloyd, 1987). Negotiating tech

niques that leave a conflict unresolved are related to
the use of violence as the “ultimate” conflict management tactic (Lloyd et al., 1989). Weak conflict management skills have also been found to be associated
with youth aggression in general (Slaby & Guerra,
1988). Thus, several program activities were designed
to improve the adolescents’ skills for managing conflict with dating partners.
Changes in dating violence and gender-role
norms and conflict management skills also may influence adolescents in abusive relationships to leave
those relationships or to stop being violent. In addition, secondary prevention activities targeted cognitive factors, which Weinstein’s precaution adoption
theory (1988) suggests influences the decision to take
preventive action, in this case to seek help with leaving an abusive partner or to stop perpetrating dating
violence. Central to precaution adoption theory are
beliefs about the need for the preventive action and
beliefs about the potential success of a given action.
Program activities were designed to increase victims’
and perpetrators’ beliefs that they need help and to
increase their awareness of the community services
where they could seek help.

Measures

At each wave, eight behavioral outcomes (four
pairs of parallel perpetration and victimization outcomes) anchored to the previous year were measured. Psychological abuse perpetration was measured by asking the adolescent “During the last year,
how often have you done the following things to
someone you had a date with?” Fourteen acts were

listed (e.g. “damaged something that belonged to
them,” “insulted them in front of others”) and response options ranged from 0 for “never” to 3 for
“very often” (Foshee, 1996). Items were summed to
create a composite measure of psychological abuse
perpetration (baseline alpha = .89). A parallel set of
questions was used to assess psychological abuse victimization (baseline alpha = .91).
Moderate physical, severe physical, and sexual
dating violence perpetration were measured by asking “During the last year, how many times have you
done the following things to a person that you had
a date with? Only include when you did it to him/her
first. In other words, don’t count it if you did it in selfdefense.” Eighteen acts were listed and response options ranged from 0 for “never” to 3 for “10 or more
times.” Composite measures for moderate physical (baseline alpha = .92), severe physical (baseline
alpha = .89), and sexual dating violence perpetration (baseline alpha = .86) were created. Moderate
physical violence included scratching, slapping, biting, pushing, grabbing, kicking, and shoving the partner, twisting the partner’s arm, slamming the partner
against the wall, bending back the partner’s fingers,
dumping them out of a car, and throwing something
at the partner. Severe physical violence included
choking, burning, and beating up a partner, hitting
the partner with a fist or something else hard, and assaulting the partner with a knife or weapon. Sexual
perpetration included forcing someone to have sex
or to do something else sexual that the partner did
not want to do. Parallel questions were used to measure moderate physical (baseline alpha = .90), severe
physical (baseline alpha = .86) and sexual dating violence victimization (baseline alpha = .74).
The five mediating variables also were assessed
at each wave. Dating violence norms and genderrole norms were assessed by asking adolescents how
strongly they agreed or disagreed with a series of
statements. The dating violence norms items assessed the adolescent’s acceptance of dating violence
under certain situations. Eight items were listed,
such as “It is ok for a boy to hit his girlfriend if she
did something to make him mad,” “It is ok for a girl
to hit a boyfriend if he hit her first,” and “A girl who
makes her boyfriend jealous on purpose deserves
to be hit.” Responses to each item were averaged
to create a composite score such that the higher the
number the more accepting of dating violence under
certain circumstances (baseline alpha = .78). Eleven
items tapped acceptance of traditional gender-role
norms, such as “In a dating relationship, the boy


should be smarter than the girl,” and “In general, the
father should have greater authority than the mother
in making decisions.” Responses to the 11 items
were averaged to create a composite score with the
higher the score the more accepting of traditional
gender-role norms (baseline alpha = .69).
Conflict management skills were assessed by
asking, “During the last 6 months, when you had a
disagreement with someone, how much of the time
did you do the following things?” Seven skills that
were taught in the Safe Dates curriculum were listed,
such as “I told the person how I felt, “I tried to calm
down before I talked to them,” and “I asked lots of
questions so that I could get the whole story.” Response options ranged from 0 for “never” to 3 for
“most of the time.” The seven items were averaged
to create a composite variable, with the higher the
number indicating the better the conflict management skills (baseline alpha = .88).
Belief in need for help was assessed with
two items. Adolescents indicated how strongly they
agreed or disagreed with the statements “Teens who
are victims of dating violence need to get help from
others,” and “Teens who are violent to their dates
need to get help from others.” Awareness of community services was assessed with a dichotomous
variable that indicated whether the adolescent knew
about the services in their community for helping
teenagers involved in abusive dating relationships.

Missing Data

It is not uncommon to find 40–50% attrition in
longitudinal school-based studies for reasons such as
withdrawal of some schools, requirement that politically sensitive questionnaire items be omitted in
some schools, and changes in consent procedures
(Horton & Lipsitz, 2001). Our parental consent procedures had to be changed mid-study. We had obtained active parental consent at baseline for adolescents to complete multiple waves of data. For wave 4
we were required to repeat our active parental consent procedures, resulting in a drop in participation
at waves 4 and 5. Attrition from baseline by wave 3
was only 12.0%, but by wave 5 was about 50%. There
were no statistically significant treatment group differences in the amount of attrition at each follow-up
wave.
Multiple imputation procedures (Rubin, 1987)
are valuable under these circumstances because
they allow for the use of data that are available and
for the creation of plausible imputations of missing

data, so that complete-data methods of analysis can
be used. Even with substantial attrition, multiple
imputation procedures yield stable test statistics and
standard errors (Horton & Lipsitz, 2001). Multiple
imputation involves a three-step process. First, sets
of plausible values for missing observations are
created based on a specified missingness equation
and an algorithm that preserves uncertainty about
non-response. Second, each complete set of data is
analyzed. Finally, the results are combined across
sets in a way that allows for the uncertainty regarding
imputation to be taken into account to produce a
single set of test statistics, parameter estimates,
and standard errors (Horton & Lipsitz, 2001). It is
recommended that the missingness equation include
all of the independent and dependent variables to
be used in final analyses, variables that could be
predictive of missing information, variables that
describe special aspects of the sample, and factors
that explain a considerable amount of the variance
in the targeted variables (Allison, 2000; Schafer,
1999).
We used a within subjects multiple imputation
procedure to decrease the likelihood that our findings would be biased by missing data (Rubin, 1987).
The missingness equation specified for a particular
outcome included the perpetration and victimization
score on the particular outcome at all available
waves, all mediating variables at all available waves,
gender, race, mother’s education, family structure
(presence of two parents or not), and treatment
condition. Missing values on each mediating variable at each wave were computed with the same
equation. Two SAS procedures were used; Proc
MI (to impute missing data based on the specified
missingness equation) and PROC MIANALYZE
(to combine the results of the imputations and
derived parameter estimates and standard errors.
(SAS Version 8, 1999). Schafer (1999) suggested
that no more than 10 sets of imputations are usually
required to obtain final stable parameter estimates
and therefore, we specified 10 sets of imputations.
For all models tested to address study aims, we inspected the multiple imputation relative frequency,
which is useful for determining if the number of sets
of imputations that are specified for the multiple
imputation procedures is enough to achieve stable
parameter estimates (Horton & Lipsitz, 2001). The
potential values of relative frequency range from 0 to
1; the closer the value is to 1, the more stable the estimates. The relative efficiency was at least .93 in all
models.


Analysis Strategy

Study aims were addressed using random coefficient regression analysis, which is a subset of the
mixed model that is useful for longitudinal data. We
conducted our analyses using SAS PROC MIXED
(SAS Version 8, 1999). We used a nested error
structure, accounting for correlation within individual’s responses over time and of individual responses
within schools.
We first determined the pattern of growth of
each of the eight dating violence outcomes without consideration of covariates, such as treatment
condition, to determine if there was enough interindividual variability in the trajectories to conduct
the models necessary for addressing study aims. Results from Wald Z tests of the asymptotic covariance parameters indicate that there is significant
(p < .0001) inter-individual variability in the eight
trajectories over time.
Next, each of the eight outcome variables was
regressed on treatment condition (0 = control and
1 = treatment condition), time (waves 2–5), timesquared, the three potential moderator variables
(gender (0 = male, 1 = female), race (0 = white
and 1 = non-white), and prior involvement in dating violence (the baseline value of the outcome
variable)), the four-way interactions between timesquared, treatment condition, and each of the three
proposed moderator variables, the three-way interactions between time, treatment condition, and each
of the three proposed moderator variables, and all
interactions composing those four- and three-way interactions. In earlier analyses we observed that the
relationship between dating violence and time was
quadratic and therefore we include the time-squared
term in our models. We used a backwards elimination procedure to eliminate non-significant interactions.
The four-way interactions of treatment by time
by time by a moderator variable (i.e. race, gender, or
prior involvement in dating violence) and the threeway interactions of treatment by time by a moderator variable were tested to determine if program
effects vary over time by prior involvement in dating violence, race, and gender. If one of these interactions is significant, it indicates that the effects
of treatment vary over time depending on values of
the moderator variable and that the pattern of dating violence over time is either quadratic (in the
four-way interactions) or linear (in the three-way
interaction).


-----

Adolescent Dating Violence 251


Non-significant interactions including moderator variables were dropped from models and we proceeded to determine if program effects vary over
time. A significant treatment by time by time or a significant treatment by time interaction indicates that
the effects of treatment vary across follow-up periods
with the pattern of dating violence over time being
quadratic or linear, respectively. If the interactions of
treatment with time and time-squared are not significant and the treatment main effect is significant, this
would indicate that there are significant main effects
of treatment at all follow-up waves and the pattern of
dating violence over time would depend on whether
there were significant time or time-squared main effects. If the interactions of treatment with time and
time-squared are not significant and the treatment
main effect is not significant, this would indicate that
there are no significant treatment effects at any of the
follow-up waves with the pattern of dating violence
over time, again, depending on whether there were
significant time or time-squared main effects.
When statistically significant interactions remained in the reduced models, we probed the interactions as follows. We calculated the predicted
mean of the outcome at each wave for each treatment condition based on the parameters of the reduced models (keeping all other variables in the
model at the mean level). We then calculated the
difference in those predicted means at each wave at
each level of the moderator variable. For these analyses, prior involvement in dating violence was reduced to three strata: no prior involvement, the mean
level of involvement (average prior involvement),
and the mean level of involvement plus one standard deviation (high prior involvement). Statistical
tests were computed to determine if the differences
in predicted means at each wave between the treatment conditions for each level of the moderator were
statistically significant. Multiple testing effects were
accommodated by Bonferroni corrections to adjust
the significance levels.
After determining program effects and moderators of those effects, we conducted analyses to
determine whether the effects of treatment over
time are explained by time dependent mediating
variables. First we followed the same procedures as
above to determine if treatment effects on mediating
variables vary over time and if treatment effects
on mediating variables vary over time by race and
gender. Those analyses controlled for the baseline
value of the mediating variable. The results from
these models are purely descriptive. To determine


mediation, we compared the effects of treatment
condition on the dating violence outcomes over time
(from the reduced models described earlier) to the
effects of treatment condition on dating violence
outcomes over time controlling for the five mediating variables measured at the five time periods.
Mediation was indicated if previously significant
treatment effects decreased to non-significance with
controls for the time-dependent mediating variables
(MacKinnon et al., 2000).

RESULTS

Safe Dates Effects and Moderators of
Effects on Perpetration

The mean and standard deviation for each perpetration outcome at each of the five waves by treatment condition are presented in Table 1. Table 2
presents the results from the reduced models examining program effects and moderators of program
effects on the four perpetration outcomes. Because
neither race nor gender moderated program effects
on any of the perpetration outcomes at any of the
follow-up waves, these interactions are not considered further.
As shown in Table 2, there are significant main
effects of treatment condition on psychological abuse
perpetration (p = .0005), moderate physical violence
perpetration (p = .02), and sexual violence perpetration (p = .04). Those findings indicate that adolescents who received Safe Dates reported perpetrating
significantly less psychological, moderate physical,
and sexual dating violence perpetration at all four
follow-up periods than those in the control group.
The absence of any significant treatment condition
by baseline outcome interactions suggests that there
are both primary and secondary prevention effects
on those three outcomes; in other words, the treatment effects were the same for those who did and
did not report using those forms of violence against a
dating partner prior to intervention exposure.
When considering severe physical perpetration,
there was a significant two-way interaction between
treatment and baseline severe physical perpetration
(p = .04). Adolescents who reported at baseline no
severe physical perpetration (p = .001) or average
amounts of severe physical perpetration (p = .005)
reported significantly less severe physical perpetration than control group adolescents at each of the
four follow up waves. For adolescents who reported

high amounts of severe physical perpetration at baseline, there were no significant differences between
the treatment and control groups in severe physical perpetration at any of the four follow-up waves
(p = .80). Thus, there appears to be both primary


and secondary prevention effects on severe physical
violence perpetration, but secondary prevention effects were not observed for adolescents who were using high amounts of severe physical violence against
their dating partners prior to the intervention.

Safe Dates Effects and Moderators of Effects
on Victimization

The mean and standard deviation for each victimization outcome at each of the five waves by treatment condition are presented in Table 1. Table 3
presents the results from the reduced models examining program effects and moderators of program effects on the four victimization outcomes. Race, gender, and prior involvement in dating violence did not
moderate Safe Dates effects on any of the victimization outcomes and therefore those interactions are
not considered further.
As shown in Table 3, there are significant
main effects of treatment condition on moderate
physical violence victimization (p = .01). Compared
to controls, adolescents who received Safe Dates reported less victimization from moderate physical dating violence at all four follow-up waves. The absence
of a significant treatment condition by baseline outcome interaction suggests that there are both primary
and secondary prevention effects on that outcome.
There was a marginal program effect on sexual victimization (p = .07) in the expected direction. Treatment condition was not associated with psychological
abuse victimization (p = .17) or severe physical victimization (p = .14) at any of the four follow-ups.

Assessment of Mediation

As shown in Table 4, there are significant main
effects of treatment condition on dating violence
norms (p < .0001), gender-role norms (p < .0001),
and beliefs in need for help (p = .02). Those findings


indicate that adolescents who received Safe Dates reported less acceptance of prescribed dating violence
norms, less acceptance of traditional gender-role
norms, and greater belief in need for help at all four
follow-up periods than those in the control group.
When predicting awareness of community services,
there was a significant interaction between treatment
condition and time-squared (p < .0001). The significant interaction reflects the fact that treatment and
control differences were greatest at wave 2 and the
least at wave 4. However, there were statistically significant (p < .0001) treatment effects in the expected
direction at all four follow-up periods. There were
no effects of treatment on conflict resolution skills at
any of the follow-up waves (p = .09).
Table 5 presents a summary of our analyses for
determining mediation. In the table, we report the
beta coefficient and p-values associated with the significant program effects presented in Tables 3 and 4
and discussed above when (1) no mediating variables
were included in the reduced models, (2) when all
five mediating variables were included in the reduced
models, and (3) when each of the five mediating variables were entered into the reduced models one at a
time. In all cases, the addition of the five mediating
variables measured at the five waves decreased significant program effects to non-significance, providing evidence for mediation. However, as can be seen
from the models in which each mediator variable was
added one at a time, some variables accounted for
more of the attenuation in the beta coefficients and
_p-values for the treatment and dating violence asso-_
ciations than others. Dating violence norms mediated
all program effects. Gender-role norms mediated

DISCUSSION

In summary, adolescents who were exposed to
Safe Dates in the eighth or ninth grade, as compared
to those who were not, reported less psychological,
moderate physical, and sexual dating violence perpetration and less moderate physical dating violence
victimization at all four follow-up periods. Additionally, there was a marginal program effect (p = .07) on
sexual dating violence victimization at all four followup periods. Also, in comparison to controls, adolescents exposed to Safe Dates and who reported at
baseline no or average prior involvement in severe
physical perpetration reported less severe physical
perpetration at all four follow-up periods. Safe Dates
had both primary and secondary prevention effects
on all six of these outcomes and the program was
equally effective for males and females and for whites
and non-whites. Program effects were mediated primarily by changes in dating violence norms, genderrole norms, and awareness of community services.


The experimental design that was used controls
for most threats to internal validity. However, threats
imposed by differential attrition and/or differential
predictors of attrition by treatment condition are not
controlled by design. Even so, it is unlikely that our
favorable effects are due to those factors because
the amount of attrition was similar for the treatment
and control groups and because we used multiple
imputation procedures to fill in missing data, thus
eliminating the possibility of differential predictors
of attrition. Another potential explanation for the
favorable effects not controlled by design is that
adolescents in the treatment group as compared to
those in the control group provided more socially
desirable responses to the behavioral measures.
However, the consistency of findings across multiple
waves and the long time period (3 years) between
program exposure and the final follow-up period
would suggest that this is an unlikely explanation. A
likely remaining explanation for the favorable effects
is that Safe Dates caused the changes observed.
In the present study, we found positive program
effects at all four follow-up periods, with the final period being 3 years after program exposure. In earlier
analyses of the eighth grade cohort, we found positive program effects 4 years after exposure to Safe
Dates (Foshee et al., 2004). Evaluations of schoolbased prevention programs targeted at other adolescent problem behaviors, like substance use, rarely
show lasting effects; behavioral effects typically

fade while effects on cognitive risk factors persist
(Dusenbury et al., 1997). Consistent and long-term
effects may have been realized because Safe Dates
was offered at the beginning of the adolescent’s dating careers (eighth and ninth grades) and included information and skills that could be incorporated into
individual dating practices that continued through
the high school years.
Mediation is directly empirically assessed by examining the effect that the inclusion of the timedependent mediating variable has on the coefficient
and significance level associated with the program to
outcome relationships (MacKinnon et al., 2000). Assessment of mediation is essential for further development and refinement of programs and for guiding
clinical practice. In the present study, we found that
program effects were mediated by dating violence
norms, gender-role norms, and awareness of community services. These are the same mediators of program effects that we found in earlier analyses of the
1-month follow-up data when attrition was very low
(Foshee et al., 1998). Conflict management skills and
belief in need for help did not mediate program effects. These findings can be directly applied to revise
Safe Dates and to develop future dating violence prevention efforts.
Safe Dates did not prevent or reduce psychological victimization at any of the follow-up periods.
While the Safe Dates curriculum incorporated examples of psychological abuse, more examples and
emphasis were given to physical and sexual violence.
The play focused on the negative consequences of a
physically abusive relationship and sources of help
for those in physically abusive relationships. Thus,
Safe Dates might have inadvertently sent a message
to adolescents that the consequences of dating a psychologically abusive partner are not severe, decreasing the adolescent’s motivation to leave those kinds
of relationships. These findings have additional implications for revising the Safe Dates program.
Safe Dates also did not prevent or reduce severe
physical victimization at any of the follow-up periods
and it did not reduce severe physical perpetration at
any of the follow-up periods by those who had perpetrated many severe physical acts prior to program
exposure. Adolescents who are being victimized by
very abusive partners, such as those who frequently
use severe forms of violence, may feel too powerless,
afraid, and trapped to leave those relationships. Perpetrators who frequently use severe forms of physical
dating violence may have patterns of abuse that resist change. Victims and perpetrators of severe phys

ical violence may require more intensive one-on-one
types of intervention for change than the Safe Dates
program provides.
Although many strengths of multiple imputation procedures have been mentioned throughout
this paper, that approach to filling in missing data
is not without issues. Although the theory guiding
those procedures has been around for approximately
40 years, the computational capabilities are very recent. Thus, there have been relatively few practical
applications of the theory and, as a result, the body of
knowledge on problems encountered in practical applications and solutions to those problems is limited.
As one example, Horton and Lipsitz (2001) suggest
that if a missingness equation is mis-specified it can
bias study conclusions. As described earlier, there are
guidelines as to which types of variables should be
specified in the missingness equation (Allison, 2000;
Schafer, 1999) but those guidelines are general. Little
research has examined how variations in the missingness equation can influence study conclusions. Another issue with using multiple imputation procedures is that it is impossible to directly test its primary
assumption that missing values are not dependent on
the value itself (Horton & Lipsitz, 2001; Patrician,
2002) because there is no way of knowing the values
of the missing data. This is a common, if not automatic, assumption made in many statistical applications. In many intervention trials for preventing adolescent problem behaviors it is possible that data are
not missing at random. Additionally, studies have not
thoroughly investigated the impact that the amount
of missing data has on the stability of parameter estimates. Despite these issues, as discussed above, multiple imputation procedures have several advantages
over other approaches to dealing with missing data.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that Safe
Dates prevented and reduced dating violence among
adolescents. Program effects were evidenced as many
as 3 years post intervention, which is an unusually
long time for sustained program effects on an adolescent problem behavior. Program effects were not
moderated by gender or race but some effects were
moderated by prior involvement in dating violence.
Our findings suggest that implementation of the Safe
Dates program to reduce dating violence is warranted. Additionally, the results from the assessment
of mediator variables provide direct guidance for
the development of future dating violence prevention programs and for the modification of the Safe
Dates program. They suggest that efforts at changing dating violence norms, gender-role norms, and

awareness of community services hold promise for
preventing adolescent dating violence and that the
content from Safe Dates focused on teaching conflict
resolution skills and altering beliefs in the need for
help need to be modified.
