Abstract Many adolescents experience sexual harassment and victims of sexual harassment have higher risks
regarding well-being and health behaviors such as higher
risks of suicidal thoughts, suicidal ideation and feeling
unsafe at school. A peer-performed play and school lessons
on preventing sexual harassment behavior were presented
to secondary school students. We evaluated its effectiveness, using a cluster-randomized controlled design to
assign schools to an experimental condition [n = 14
schools; 431 students (51 % female)] and a control condition [n = 11 schools; 384 students (51 % female)]. To
measure the effects of the intervention at first post-test and

6-month follow-up, our multilevel analyses used a twolevel random intercept model. Outcome measures were
sexual harassment behaviors, behavioral determinants and
distal factors influencing these behaviors. At post-test,
students in the experimental group reported a reduced
intention to commit sexual harassment behavior and higher
self-efficacy in rejecting it. At post-test and follow-up there
was a significant positive effect on social norms for
rejecting sexual harassment behavior. At follow-up, sexual
self-esteem was higher in students in the experimental
group than in the control group. Effects on these determinants will benefit adolescents’ future sexual behaviors. In
combination, the play and lessons, possibly together with
continued sexual health education and skills programs on
social-emotional learning in subsequent school years, have
potential for preventing sexual harassment behavior.

### Introduction

Sexual harassment is defined as unwanted sexual attention.
Many adolescents experience it—as victims, perpetrators
or both. As well as physical contact such as kissing, hugging and touching, it can include non-physical contact such
as sexual remarks, jokes, gestures and looks, or showing
sexually explicit pictures, messages or notes or spreading
sexually related rumors (McMaster et al. 2002; Young
et al. 2009). By using this broad definition, high prevalence
rates among young people might be expected.

The estimated prevalence of sexual harassment behavior
varies according to the definition used (McMaster et al.
2002; Young et al. 2009), age (Hill and Kearl 2011),


-----

ethnicity (AAUW 2001), education (De Graaf et al. 2012)
and timeframe (Witkowska and Menckel 2005; De Bruijn
et al. 2006). In Western populations, the prevalence rates
for girls as victims lie between 45 and 56 % (vs. 40–55 %
for boys as victims). For girls as perpetrators, they lie
between 7 and 21 % (vs. 13–36 % for boys as perpetrators)
(McMaster et al. 2002; Hill and Kearl 2011; Yu Li et al.
2010). For adolescents of both sexes, these prevalence rates
change with age: while 12 to 13-year-old male students
reported more sexual harassment victimization than those
aged 17–18, older female students reported more sexual
harassment victimization than their younger counterparts
(Hill and Kearl 2011).
Research also has shown differences in sexual harassment between ethnic groups and the educational level of
students. With regard to ethnic differences, white adolescents are more often involved in non-physical sexual
harassment, whereas other ethnic groups in physical sexual
harassment (AAUW 2001). Relative to students with a
higher educational level (i.e. senior general secondary
education), those with a lower educational level (i.e. prevocational education) are more vulnerable to sexual
harassment (De Graaf et al. 2012).
Adolescent victims of sexual harassment have higher
risks of suicidal thoughts, suicidal ideation and feeling
unsafe at school (Chiodo et al. 2009; Exner-Cortens et al.
2013). In addition, female victims have higher risks of selfharm, eating problems, lower self-esteem, increased heavy
episodic drinking, depressive symptomatology, and smoking (Goldstein et al. 2007; Chiodo et al. 2009; ExnerCortens et al. 2013). Male victims of sexual harassment
have higher risks of antisocial behavior and marijuana use
(Exner-Cortens et al. 2013).
The behavioral determinants subjective norm and selfefficacy are significant predictors of behavioral intention
with regard to rejecting sexual harassment for boys and
girls alike (Yu Li et al. 2010). These determinants from the
Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen 1991) and Reasoned
Action Approach (Fishbein and Ajzen 2010) assume
decision making to be a reasoned and deliberative process
(Albarracı´n et al. 2001). The Prototype Willingness Model,
however, can help to explain non-intentional, but volitional
adolescent risk behavior (Gerrard et al. 2008). One of the
assumptions of the Prototype Willingness Model is that
children and adolescents have clear cognitive representations or social images (prototypes) of the type of person
their age who engages in specific risk behaviors (Gibbons
et al. 2004; Connor and Norman 2005). If we extrapolate
from Webb and Sheeran’s (2006) suggestion that attention
should be paid to non-intentional routes to adolescents’
action, it may thus be relevant to study adolescents’ images
of prototypes of victims and perpetrators of sexual


harassment. Effects of perceptions of prototype behavior
have been found earlier in studies on adolescent alcohol
use (Todd and Mullan 2011) and smoking behavior
(Hukkelberg and Dykstra 2009). Several studies also
showed that sexual harassment behavior is also influenced
by attitudes towards gender roles, attitudes towards media
influence, and the adolescents’ self-esteem (De Bruijn et al.
2006).
Research shows that students’ sexual harassment
behavior can be reduced by dedicated school lessons
(Wolfe et al. 2009). One example is the Safe Dates program for American schools. Consisting of a theatre production performed by peers that is followed up by a series
of lessons, this showed positive short and long-term effects
on conflict-management skills and sexual violence reported
by victims and perpetrators (Foshee et al. 2004; Foshee
et al. 1998). Similarly, modeling through peer-education
and theatre are suitable methods for changing students’
attitudes and images of prototypes (Hecht et al. 1993;
Stephenson et al. 2008; Mellanby et al. 2001). Other areas
of health behavior in which school theatre-based prevention programs were associated with positive effects include
drink driving and riding with a drunk driver (Quek et al.
2012), illicit drug use (Quek et al. 2012), and fruit and
vegetable consumption (Perry et al. 2002).

Current Study

This article evaluates the effectiveness of Benzies & Batchies (Felten and Janssens 2014), an interactive schoolbased program developed in the Netherlands to prevent
male and female adolescent sexual harassment behavior in
secondary school students by combining a play with skills
lessons and peer education. The name of the program was
derived from street slang for ‘‘pimp cars’’ and ‘‘scantily
dressed girls’’. Trained adolescent peer-educators serve as
models in the play and the ensuing group discussion.
Benzies & Batchies is based on the principles of the Theory
of Planned Behavior (Ajzen 1991), Reasoned Action
Approach (Fishbein and Ajzen 2010) and Prototype
Willingness Model (Gerrard et al. 2008) (see Fig. 1).
This study had three research objectives. The first was
to establish any effects of Benzies & Batchies on sexual
harassment behavior (victimization and perpetration) and
its five determinants: attitude, perceived social norm, selfefficacy, intention, and prototype. The second was to
establish any effects of Benzies & Batchies on three distal
factors: attitude towards gender roles, attitude towards
media influence and sexual self-esteem. The third was to
establish whether any effects found differed with regard
to the adolescents’ gender, educational level and
ethnicity.

### Methods

Intervention

Benzies & Batchies consisted of four complementary elements: (a) an introductory lesson, (b) an educational peerperformed play followed by a peer-led group discussion,
(c) three classroom lessons, each 100–150 min, to teach
skills and resilience regarding social and sexual behavior;
and (d) a closing lesson. The main objective of the intervention was to reduce the risk of sexual harassment
behavior among adolescents, both as victims and as perpetrators. Although such behavior was discussed mainly in
a heterosexual context, homophobic behaviors were dealt
with whenever the topic arose during the lessons.
The play was comprised of short scenes in which male
and female peer-educators performed examples of sexual
harassment (both victimization and perpetration) and of
reactions to them. The play lasted 30 min and was followed
by a 60-min discussion (Felten and Janssens 2014). The
introductory and closing lessons were given in the classroom by the students’ own teacher. The three lessons
addressing students’ skills and resilience were presented by
experienced and trained social-skills instructors from outside the school.
To change the determinants of the risk behavior and
desired behaviors, the designers of the Benzies & Batchies
program first identified appropriate behavior-change
methods (Bartholomew et al. 2011), basing their approach
on the understanding that peer-educators can use modeling
to influence students’ perception of other people’s behavior
(social normative behavior; Bandura 1986). To influence
the behavioral determinants of sexual harassment,

## 1 3


modeling, planning coping responses, resistance to social
pressure and guided practice are used during the skills
lessons (McAlister et al. 2008; Marlatt and Donovan 2005;
Evans et al. 1992). The application of the behavior-change
methods was further elaborated within the program into
worksheets, discussions, films, and role-play.
Benzies & Batchies was first implemented in 2011.
Since then, it has been carried out over a hundred times in
approximately 45 schools in urban areas across the
Netherlands.

Participants and Procedure

For participation in the study, we approached schools for
pre-vocational and senior general secondary education in
[urban areas in the Netherlands (https://www.government.](https://www.government.nl/topics/secondary-education)
[nl/topics/secondary-education). These schools were part of](https://www.government.nl/topics/secondary-education)
the mainstream regular Dutch school system that assigns
students at a relatively early age to schools with different
educational levels. The inclusion of lower educational level
pre-vocational schools was seen as particularly important,
given the higher prevalence of sexual harassment behavior
among the students (De Graaf et al. 2012). In all, 25
schools participated. Per school, between one and three
classes were involved.
We followed a cluster-randomized controlled design in
which schools were paired according to educational level
and the degree of urbanization of the school area. The
schools were then randomly assigned to the experimental
or control condition. The target group consisted of male
and female urban adolescents aged 12–16 years from various ethnic backgrounds.


-----

Fourteen schools in the experimental group received the
program (21 classes). Due to practicalities regarding the
number of days on which the play could be performed, the
intervention was carried out between January 2011 and June
2012. Per school, the duration of the program ranged from 4
to 6 weeks. Students in the experimental group filled out
paper-and-pencil questionnaires in the classroom at three
time points: before the presentation of the play (baseline;
T0); just after the end of the program (post-test; T1); and
6 months after the end of the program (follow-up; T2).
In the control group, 11 schools (18 classes) carried out
their usual school curriculum. These schools were put on a
waiting list and given the opportunity to receive the
intervention after all data collection in the school had finished. Students in the control group filled out the questionnaires parallel to the students in the experimental
condition.
During the measurements a research assistant was present. A passive-consent procedure was applied: all students
could object to filling out the questionnaire. The protocol
was approved by the Research Board of the Netherlands
Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO).

Measures

Table 1 shows a summary of the questionnaire scales and
items.

Sexual Harassment Behavior

The items used to assess sexual harassment behavior in the
past 6 months were based on questionnaires used in Dutch
research and adapted for this purpose (De Graaf et al. 2005;
Kuyper et al. 2009). Questions on non-physical and physical behaviors were presented from two perspectives: the
victim’s (e.g., letting a friend know you don’t want to
receive sexually explicit pictures; being forced to have
sex); and the perpetrator’s (e.g., promising someone
something in return for sex; watching someone getting
undressed, or being naked).

Attitude, Perceived Social Norm, Self-Efficacy
and Intention

Scales were based on determinants of behavior taken from
the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen 1991) and Social
Learning Theory (Bandura 1986). For each behavior,
questions were asked on the attitude and perceived social
norm, taking the victim’s and perpetrator’s perspectives on
sexual harassment behavior. Using four imaginary scenarios related to demonstrating or dealing with sexual
harassment, questions were presented to the respondents,
each targeting self-efficacy and intention on the parts of


perpetrator and victim. Per scenario, one question was
asked regarding self-efficacy and one regarding intention.

Prototype

Descriptions of two adolescent victims of sexual harassment

[a boy/a girl who allows sex (such as kissing, fondling or
having sexual intercourse) when he/she doesn’t want to] and
two adolescent perpetrators [a boy/a girl who wants to start
sexual activity (such as kissing, fondling or having sexual
intercourse) with someone who doesn’t want to] were presented on the basis of the Prototype Willingness Model
(Gibbons et al. 2004; Connor and Norman 2005). Respondents were asked to state their opinion with regard to each of
the prototypes depicted, i.e. whether they thought of the
victim as being either bad or good; and whether they thought
of the perpetrator as being either bad or good.

Distal Factors

There were three distal factors: attitude towards gender
roles, which was assessed on a 12-item scale (Hofstetter
et al. 2014); attitude towards media influence, which was
assessed on an 8-item scale (De Graaf et al. 2009; Nikken
2007); and sexual self-esteem, which was assessed on a
7-item scale (Rostosky et al. 2008).

Background Characteristics

As well as age, gender and educational level, we assessed
whether the participants had ever had sexual intercourse.
Ethnicity of the child was assessed by looking at the parents’ country of birth. Parents of native children were born
in the Netherlands, parents of non-native children were
born outside the Netherlands.
The questionnaire was pretested among students of
various educational levels and ethnic backgrounds.

Data Analysis

To describe and test students’ background characteristics
between the study groups at baseline, we performed
descriptive analyses, Student’s t tests and Chi square tests.
To validate the scales measuring behavioral determinants,
we carried out factor and reliability analyses on the baseline data. In case the factor analysis showed that items of a
scale loaded on different factors, subscales were created
(e.g., broken down by victim and perpetrator). To allow
higher scores to reflect a more desirable outcome, questionnaire items regarding the determinants of behavior
were re-coded. Items regarding behavior itself were summed, such that higher scores would reflect more sexual
harassment behavior in terms of frequency. Means and

sexual intercourse. The mean age of the students in the
experimental group was 14.62 years (SD = 0.82), compared with 14.14 years (SD = 0.70) in the control group.
Nearly half of the respondents in the experimental group
(48 %) had a non-native background, against 66 % of those
in the control group. Fifteen percent of respondents in the
experimental group reported having had sexual intercourse
once or more, against 7 % of those in the control group.
There were no statistical differences between the study
groups with regard to gender, educational level, having a
girlfriend or boyfriend, or sexual harassment behavior.
About 32 % of all respondents reported having been a
victim of some kind of sexual harassment once or more in
the past 6 months; 29 % reported having committed it, and
over a quarter of respondents (27 %) reported having
rejected it by saying ‘no’ (see Table 2). At the first posttest, the non-respondents were slightly younger and had a
higher educational level than the respondents. There were
more non-respondents in the control group than in the
experimental group at the first post-test. At follow-up, there
were no statistically significant differences between
respondents and non-respondents.

Main Effects at First Post-test

At the first post-test, significant main effects were found for
two determinants (social norm and self-efficacy) with
regard to rejecting sexual harassment (see Table 3). Students in the experimental group (exp) reported a more
positive social norm with regard to rejecting sexual
harassment than students in the control group (con)
(D[�]exp = .36, D[�]con = -.46 resp.; p \ .05). Relative to students in the control condition, those in the experimental
group also reported higher self-efficacy with regard to
successfully rejecting sexual harassment behavior by saying ‘no’ (D[�]exp = .33, D[�]con = -.12 resp.; p \ .05). With
regard to committing sexual harassment, a significant main
effect was found on one determinant: intention. Relative to
students in the control group, those in the experimental
group had less intention of committing sexual harassment
(D[�]exp = .44, D[�]con = -.21 resp.; p \ .01). At the first posttest, there were no significant main effects on the remaining determinants of sexual harassment behavior and on the
distal factors influencing it.

Main Effects at Six-Month Follow-Up

At 6-month follow-up we found no significant main effects
on undergoing, rejecting and committing sexual harassment
(see Table 3). However, the significant main effect on the
determinant social norm with regard to rejecting it was


-----

## 1 3


-----

maintained (D[�]exp = -.09, D[�]con = -.83 resp.; p \ .05).
This was due to the fact that the decrease in social norm for
students in the experimental condition was small, whereas
this decrease was large for students in the control group. A
significant main effect was also found on a distal factor,
sexual self-esteem, students in the experimental group
reporting higher sexual self-esteem than those in the control
group (D[�]exp = 1.36, D[�]con = -.43 resp.; p \ .01). No further
significant main effects were found on the remaining
determinants or distal factors influencing the behavior.

Interaction Effects


At the first post-test, an interaction effect on the determinant prototype of a victim of sexual harassment was found
between study group and gender. Relative to boys in the
control group, boys in the experimental group reported a
more negative image of this prototype (D[�]exp = -.16,
D�con = -.44; p = .01). An intervention effect on self-efficacy was also found between study group and ethnicity,
non-native students in the experimental group reporting a
higher self-efficacy with regard to not committing sexual
harassment than non-native students in the control group
(D[�]exp = .14, D[�]con = -.20; p \ .05).
At 6-month follow-up, significant interaction effects were
found between study group and educational level (see
Fig. 3) on the following three determinants: attitude towards
committing sexual harassment (D[�]exp = .55, D[�]con = -.58;
p \ .05); social norm with regard to committing sexual
harassment behavior (D[�]exp = .54, D[�]con = -.46; p \ .05);
and prototype of a perpetrator of sexual harassment
(D[�]exp = .11, D[�]con = -.33; p \ .05). Students with a higher
educational level in the experimental group reported a more
negative attitude towards committing sexual harassment and
also reported a more negative social norm with regard to
committing sexual harassment behavior than students with a
higher educational level in the control group. In addition,
students with a higher educational level in the experimental
group reported a more negative image of the prototype of a
perpetrator of sexual harassment than students with a higher
educational level in the control group. No further interaction
effects were found on the remaining determinants and distal
factors influencing the behavior.

### Discussion


There are two reasons why it is necessary to research the
effectiveness of programs preventing sexual harassment
behavior. First, many adolescents experience sexual
harassment. Second, adolescent victims of sexual harassment have higher risks regarding well-being and a number

Fig. 3 Interaction effects between study group and educational level
on (1) attitude towards committing sexual harassment, (2) social norm
with regard to committing sexual harassment and (3) attitude towards
prototype sexual harassment at 6 months follow-up (crude means)

of health behaviors. These reasons led to this study, which
assessed the effectiveness of Benzies & Batchies, a program that targets the prevention of sexual harassment
behavior through a peer-performed play, peer-led group
discussion and lessons for secondary school students given
by trained expert instructors. This study examined the
effects on sexual harassment behaviors (victimization and
perpetration), determinants of these behavior and distal
factors, and differences in subgroups of adolescents’ gender, educational level and ethnicity.


At 6-month follow-up, no significant effects were found
on sexual harassment behavior (victimization and perpetration). This is in line with other study results on the
prevention of adolescent sexual assault (Black et al. 2000)
and of sexual harassment in dating situations (Foshee et al.
1998; Foshee et al. 2000). Research has shown that sexual
harassment behaviors, such as making sexual comments or
gestures, showing sexy or sexually explicit pictures, and
touching someone in a sexual way are part of life within
this age group (Hill and Kearl 2011; Temple and Choi
2014). The lack of effects on behavior may be explained by
the relatively short interval between measurement, the low
frequency of self-reported sexual harassment behavior, and
students’ lack of awareness of the occurrence of sexual
harassment behavior.
With regard to determinants of the behavior, relative to
students in the control group, those in the experimental
group had less intention of committing sexual harassment
at first post-test and they reported a higher self-efficacy
with regard to successfully rejecting sexual harassment by
saying ‘‘no’’. At follow-up, the significant short-term effect
on perceived social norm with regard to rejecting sexual
harassment behavior had been sustained - students in the
experimental group reported a more positive social norm
with regard to rejecting sexual harassment than students in
the control group. At follow-up, however, the effects on the
other determinants had not. At 6-month follow-up a significant effect was also found on sexual self-esteem: students in the experimental group reported higher sexual selfesteem than students in the control group. All significant
effects had small effect sizes.
Although few effects differed with regard to adolescents’
gender, educational level and ethnicity, the interaction
effects that were found on the prototype image of a person
their age who engages in sexual harassment behavior complement earlier research on adolescents’ unintended behavior (Hukkelberg and Dykstra 2009). At follow-up, boys in the
experimental group were found to have a more negative
image of the prototype of a victim of sexual harassment.

Strengths and Limitations

Although many programs have been developed to address
the risks and protective factors for intimate partner violence or sexual violence among adolescents, most were
one-off pilots, had a weak research design or short followup periods (Lundgren and Amin 2015). The strengths of
our study are its cluster-randomized controlled design and
its 6-month follow-up period. Neither, after the start of the
intervention, were any of the participating schools lost to
follow-up. And, although the study results are relevant to
educating young urban students who engage in

## 1 3


-----

heterosexual contacts, the program also dealt with homophobic behaviors whenever the topic arose during the
lessons.
However, there are also limitations, some of which are
inherent to the challenges of conducting research in this
particular target group. Firstly, as not all students reported
having sexual experiences, they may not have been able to
imagine being in a situation of sexual harassment and/or
being interested in having a relationship or sex. Secondly,
some questionnaire scales were developed or adapted for
the purpose of this particular research. Their further validation is recommended. Thirdly, as we used students’ selfreports on a delicate subject, the prevalence rates may have
been underreported: students might have found it difficult
to report having committed sexual harassment, or having
been a victim of it. Finally, this study was conducted in
schools in an urban setting. Different results may be produced by research into the effectiveness of the Benzies &
Batchies intervention in schools in non-urban areas.

Implications for Practice

Two promising results of this combination of a play and
school lessons are the long-term effects on the perceived
social norm against sexual harassment and the improvement in sexual self-esteem. Prior research showed middle
adolescence (age 14–18) to be a significant period for the
development of the personality and of ability to resist peer
pressure (Steinberg and Monahan 2007). The development
of a firm, positive social norm in this developmental phase
may thus benefit adolescents’ future sexual behaviors.
If, in subsequent years, schools extend health education
on preventing sexual harassment behavior, tailoring it to
the needs of the students of various age groups, this may
reinforce the effects of the play and skills lessons we
evaluate above, which were given to students aged 13–14.
Older and more sexually experienced students may then
use the cognitions they gained in earlier lessons in previous
classes. It is recommended for different age groups that
theme-based lessons on sexual behavior are combined with
skills programs on social-emotional learning (Payton et al.
2008). Promising results on the effectiveness of transferoriented learning also suggest that the prevention of sexual
harassment behavior might also be positively influenced by
education on other sexual risk behaviors, such as the prevention of unprotected sexual intercourse and sexually
transmitted diseases (Peters et al. 2013; Kirby et al. 2007).
An intervention targeting a combination of these behaviors
might prove effective.
Students’ reactions to the program showed that they
acknowledged the deployment of peer-educators and
highlighted the importance of feeling safe in the group.
While research on peer-led education showed no effects or

## 1 3


only limited effects on behavior change (Stephenson et al.
2008; Mellanby et al. 2001), the present study and other
studies on the effectiveness of education programs on
sexual harassment and dating violence showed that the
combination of a peer-led play and skills lessons can have
an impact on the students’ cognitions regarding the targeted behavior (Foshee et al. 2004; Foshee et al. 1998).

Recommendations for Further Research

The findings of our study highlight the importance of
research on the prevention of adolescent sexual harassment. We recommend an evaluation study in which students’ behavior is followed up over a longer period. Since
we found students with a higher educational level in the
experimental group reported a more negative attitude and a
more negative social norm towards committing sexual
harassment, and they reported a more negative attitude
towards the prototype of a perpetrator as well, further
research is also necessary to examine whether Benzies &
Batchies suits the needs of those whose educational level is
lower. Further research is also recommended on how
intervention designers should address prototypes of victims
and perpetrators of sexual harassment in their programs.
More insight is needed into how students of all educational
levels can change their prototype beliefs, and into how
such change can affect their behavior over time.

### Conclusion

Many adolescents experience sexual harassment behavior—as victims, perpetrators or both. The prevention of this
behavior is important because adolescent victims have
higher risks regarding well-being and health behaviors such
as suicidal thoughts, suicidal ideation and feeling unsafe at
school. This study adds to the evidence on the effectiveness
of programs preventing sexual harassment behavior. The
Benzies & Batchies program targets the prevention of
sexual harassment behavior through a peer-performed play,
peer-led group discussion and lessons for secondary school
students given by trained expert instructors. Our research
into the effectiveness of the program showed that, in the
short term, students had less intention to commit sexual
harassment behavior. It also showed a short and longerterm change in their perceived social norm with regard to
rejecting this behavior and their sexual self-esteem. Effects
on these determinants will benefit adolescents’ future
sexual behaviors. We, therefore, conclude that combination
of the play and the lessons have the potential to prevent
sexual harassment behavior. These effects could be reinforced by combining continued health education on preventing sexual harassment behavior in subsequent school

years with education on other sexual risk behaviors or
skills programs on social-emotional learning.
