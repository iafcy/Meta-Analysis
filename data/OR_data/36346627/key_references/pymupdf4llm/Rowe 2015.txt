# Reducing Sexual Victimization Among Adolescent Girls: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial of My Voice, My Choice

### Lorelei Simpson Rowe Ernest N. Jouriles Renee McDonald Southern Methodist University


Despite extensive efforts to develop and implement programs to
prevent sexual violence, few programs have empiricallydemonstrated efficacy. The primary exceptions are programs
that emphasizerisk-reductionskills;yet eventhese programs are
not consistently effective. This study seeks to add to the
literature by evaluating the effects of My Voice, My Choice
(MVMC), a 90-minute assertive resistance training program
that emphasizes skill practice in an immersive virtual environment (IVE). We hypothesized that MVMC would reduce
male-to-female sexual victimization among adolescent girls
over a 3-month follow-up period. We also examined whether
these results would generalize to other forms of male-to-female
relationship violence and to girls’ psychological distress.
Eighty-three female students from an urban public high school
were randomized to MVMC (n = 47) or to a wait-list control
condition (n = 36); 78 provided data over the 3-month
follow-up period. Participants assigned to MVMC were less
likely than control participants to report sexual victimization
during the follow-up period. Our results also suggest that
MVMC reduced risk for psychological victimization and for
psychological distress among participants with greater prior
victimization at baseline. The promising results of this pilot trial
suggest that MVMC may help girls evade male-to-female
relationship violence.

ONE QUARTER TO ONE HALF OF WOMEN in the U.S. are
victims of sexual violence in their lifetime, most
commonly in their teens or early twenties (U.S.
Department of Justice, 2006) and most often
perpetrated by someone they know (Testa, VanZileTamsen, & Livingston, 2007). Sexual victimization
is associated with numerous immediate and long-term
deleterious effects (Baker & Sommers, 2008;
Campbell, Dworkin, & Cabral, 2009; Littleton,
Axsom, & Grills-Taquechel, 2009; Littleton &
Henderson, 2009). Moreover, experiencing any
type of interpersonal violence (e.g., sexual, physical,
psychological) dramatically increases the risk of
future revictimization (Finkelhor, Ormord, & Turner, 2007; Macy, 2008). As a result, preventing sexual
violence has become a high priority for high schools
and colleges. Unfortunately, although many sexual
violence prevention programs have been developed,
few have been rigorously evaluated, and even fewer
have been shown to actually reduce sexual victimization (Anderson & Whiston, 2005; Morrison,
Hardison, Mathew, & O’Neil, 2004).
One of the most common types of prevention
programs focuses on reducing risk for victimization
(in the criminology literature, this is often referred to
as target hardening; Hummer & Preston, 2006).
Risk-reduction programs are designed to raise awareness about sexual violence, challenge rape-supportive
beliefs, and teach skills for identifying and escaping
threatening situations, thereby helping individuals
protect themselves (Morrison et al., 2004). Such
programs are typically psycho-educational in nature,
and are usually targeted at females, primarily because
females are at greater risk than males for sexual
victimization (U.S. Department of Justice, 2006).
Unfortunately, risk-reduction programs, as a group,


-----

have only small-to-moderate effect sizes on victimization (mean weighted effect size of d = .10 across 13
studies) (Anderson & Whiston, 2005). However,
risk-reduction programs that have a more specific
(and typically more thorough) focus on self-protection
skills tend to have larger effect sizes, compared to
those that are broader in their coverage of topics or
focus primarily on raising awareness and/or changing
beliefs (Morrison et al., 2004). Still, not all programs
that focus on self-protection succeed in reducing
victimization (Anderson & Whiston, 2005; Morrison
et al., 2004). One possible reason is that, although
skills may be taught and demonstrated, there is
typically limited opportunity for participants to
practice skills or to receive feedback on their skill
mastery. The lack of practice and corrective feedback
may result in poor skill acquisition if the skills are
relatively new to participants or if they find self-protection behaviors challenging.
The current study builds upon the existing
literature on the prevention of sexual violence by
evaluating the efficacy of My Voice, My Choice
(MVMC), a program designed to reduce sexual
victimization by teaching adolescent girls a specific
set of self-protection skills—assertive resistance—and
providing them with multiple opportunities to
practice skills in realistic simulations. MVMC targets
assertive resistance because there is consistent evidence that girls and women who engage in such
behaviors (e.g., saying “no” firmly, yelling, or
physically fighting back) are more likely to escape a
sexually coercive situation without being raped,
compared to those who engage in more passive
(e.g., freezing or crying) or polite (e.g., explaining or
apologizing) resistance (Ullman, 2007). Moreover,
research with actual and potential perpetrators of
sexual violence indicates that girls and women with a
confident, assertive self-presentation are less likely to
be identified as potential victims (Book, Costello, &
Camilleri, 2013; Parks, Hequembourg, & Dearing,
2008; Sakaguchi & Hasegawa, 2006) and that
assertive resistance is more likely to be perceived as
true rather than “token” refusal (Garcia, 1998). In
addition, there is experimental evidence suggesting
that training in assertive resistance can reduce the
likelihood of sexual victimization (e.g., Gidycz et al.,
2001; Simpson Rowe, Jouriles, McDonald, Platt, &
Gomez, 2012). Thus, correlational and experimental
data are consistent with a theorized causal relation:
Assertive resistance in response to unwanted sexual
advances or sexual coercion may help girls and
women escape potentially dangerous interpersonal
situations and reduce likelihood of harm.
Extensive research on skill acquisition indicates
that skills learned under conditions similar to those in
which they are to be used are more likely to generalize


to the “real world” than skills learned under
dissimilar conditions (Eich, 1995; Forgas, 2008).
The real-world context for self-protection skills is that
of sexual coercion or unwanted sexual advances; thus
girls and women must be able to enact skills in
situations that commonly cause fear and anger, are
stressful, and are potentially dangerous (O’Sullivan,
Byers, & Finkelman, 1998). Simulation-based learning offers a mechanism to learn and practice skills
under circumstances that more closely approximate
situations in which they might be applied (Jouriles,
McDonald, et al., 2009). Simulations have been used
in commercial and military aviation (e.g., flight
simulators) for decades (de Winter, Dodou, &
Mulder, 2012), and are currently used in fields
ranging from the military to medicine (e.g., physicians
conduct clinical exams with “standardized patients”
who present with particular configurations of symptoms) (Lane, Hood, & Rollnick, 2008; Van Hasselt,
Romano, & Vecchi, 2008).
Based on research that supports the benefits
of behavioral practice for learning social skills
(Mueser & Bellack, 2007; Spranger, Schatz, &
Knopf, 2008), MVMC provides participants opportunities to practice assertive resistance and to receive
feedback on their use of these skills. This practice is
conducted in an immersive virtual environment
(IVE), using simulations of situations that pose
potential risk for sexual victimization. An IVE is a
computer-simulated environment, created using virtual-reality technology that is designed to help
participants suspend “normal” reality and experience
a “new” reality. In this research, coercive situations
that sometimes occur between teens (e.g., sitting next
to an adolescent boy in his bedroom when he is trying
to convince the participant to kiss him) are simulated
in the IVE, so that the participant experiences herself
as “in” the coercive situation. IVEs create a more
realistic and immersive “sexually coercive” situation
that elicits greater negative emotion than face-to-face
role plays (Jouriles et al., 2009, 2011) and have been
used successfully in research on sexual coercion and
physical violence (e.g., Jouriles, Simpson Rowe,
McDonald, & Kleinsasser, 2014; Slater et al., 2013).
Repeated practice of assertive resistance in simulated high-risk situations might be especially beneficial for girls and women who have suffered previous
sexual victimization, because they are less likely than
nonvictims to respond to sexually coercive behavior
with assertive resistance (e.g., Gidycz, Van Wynsberghe, & Edwards, 2008; Jouriles et al., 2011; Katz,
May, Sorenson, & DelTosta, 2010). One explanation for this finding is that previously victimized
women are at greater risk for trauma symptoms and/
or physiological arousal when faced with sexual
coercion, which can lead them to feel overwhelmed


-----

and unable to respond (e.g., Fortier et al., 2009;
Messman-Moore, Walsh, & DiLillo, 2010). If so,
repeated practice in simulated high-risk situations
may offer a form of exposure, reducing the potential
effects of trauma symptoms or arousal on future
behavioral responses. Practice also has the potential
to provide previously victimized girls or women with
successful experiences of resisting unwanted sexual
advances and to help them overcome feelings of
helplessness or powerlessness. The current study
evaluates whether the effects of MVMC are moderated by prior victimization.
The current study further extends the literature by
evaluating whether effects of a program focused on
reducing sexual violence through training and practice
in assertive resistance extend to other forms of
male-to-female violence. There is increasing evidence
that the various types of victimization in childhood
and adolescence are correlated (Hamby, Finkelhor, &
Turner, 2012). For example, victims ofsexual violence
also tend to be victims of physical and psychological
relationship violence. There is speculation that certain
characteristics of children and adolescents “act as
magnets for victimization” (Finkelhor, 2008, p. 56),
and a case can be made that difficulties with assertive
resistance (e.g., enforcing boundaries and stating
wishes in a clear, confident manner) is one of these
characteristics. Moreover, the ability to assertively
resist unwanted behaviors is considered an important
skill for fostering healthy teen relationships in general,
and for avoiding potentially dangerous relationships
during adolescence (e.g., Wolfe et al., 2003). In short,
there are reasons to believe that the development of
assertive resistance skills might have positive effects on
reducing other forms of interpersonal victimization.
We also explored the effects of MVMC on
psychological distress. Certain forms of interpersonal victimization, such as experiencing psychological aggression (e.g., being insulted, ridiculed,
the subject of malicious rumors) occur frequently in
teen relationships (Jouriles, Garrido, Rosenfield, &
McDonald, 2009), and all forms of interpersonal
violence victimization (sexual, physical, and psychological) are associated with emotional distress
(Ackard & Neumark-Sztainer, 2002; Callahan,
Tolman, & Saunders, 2003; Jouriles et al., 2009).
Moreover, the continual experience of unpleasant
events, even minor ones, over a period of time can
damage psychological health (Kanner, Coyne,
Schaefer, & Lazarus, 1981). We reasoned that an
intervention that reduces victimization may have
the added benefit of reducing distress.
In sum, MVMC was designed to reduce male-tofemale sexual victimization among adolescent girls by
providing them training and realistic practice with
assertive resistance skills. MVMC is distinct from


most other violence prevention programs in at least a
couple of important ways. First, the focus of MVMC
is on acquisition of one particular set of skills, assertive
resistance, as opposed to covering a broad array of
topics. Because of this focus, considerable time can be
spent on practicing skills, with feedback and coaching
to assist participants in mastering the skills and
gaining confidence in their ability to use them when
needed. Second, MVMC makes use of IVEs to allow
participants to practice skills in more realistic
situations, which is theorized to be important for
newly learned skills to generalize to situations outside
of the learning environment. It is also noteworthy that
MVMC is quite brief (one 90-minute session); it was
designed to be economically and logistically feasible
for schools to adopt and use as a stand-alone program
or as an adjunct to existing programs.
This pilot study is a randomized controlled trial
examining the effects of MVMC on sexual victimization and evaluating whether the effects generalize to other forms of male-to-female violence
victimization (i.e., psychological and physical) and
to psychological distress among adolescent girls.
We hypothesized that, compared to participants in
the control condition, those in the MVMC condition would be less likely to experience sexual
victimization, nonsexual victimization (i.e., physical and psychological), and psychological distress.
We also evaluated whether a history of previous
victimization moderated program effects. This is
important because sexual victimization prevention
efforts have frequently been less efficacious for girls
and women who had already been sexually
victimized (Morrison et al., 2004); however, as
suggested above, there are reasons to expect
MVMC to be effective with this group.

### Method
#### sample
Students were recruited from an all-girls urban public
high school serving a predominantly minority
population in a large Southwestern city. All students
(average yearly enrollment of 220 across 9th through
12th grades) enrolled at the high school were eligible
to participate. The study was advertised through
announcements in classes, posters distributed around
the school, and discussions with study staff, who
were regularly available during lunch periods.
Students who wished to participate were given a
letter describing the study and parental consent and
youth assent forms, printed in English and Spanish.
Students were instructed to return the signed parental
consent and youth assent forms to study staff if they
wished to participate. Eighty-five students returned
consent forms and 83 (38% of the students enrolled
at the school, 83/220) completed the baseline

assessment, which was conducted at school, usually
during lunch or a free period.
The 83 girls who completed the baseline assessment
were randomized to the MVMC condition (n = 47) or
to a wait-list control condition (n = 36). Participant
age ranged from 14 to 18 (M = 15.63, SE = .95).
There was fairly even distribution across the 9th (23/
83, 28%), 10th (28/83, 34%), and 11th grades (28/
83, 34%), but only 4 out of 83 participants (4%) were
in the 12th grade. The sample was predominantly
Hispanic (66/83, 80%), with 17% (14/83) African
American, 2% Non-Hispanic White (2/83), and 1%
Asian (1/83). Slightly over half of participants
reported ever having had a romantic relationship
(46/83, 55%) and slightly over one quarter were
currently in a dating relationship at the time of the
study (22/83, 27%), all with males. Current partners
ranged in age from 14 to 19 (M = 16.77, SD = 1.45)
and were, on average, one year older than the
participants (M = 1.05, SD = 1.36).

#### procedures
All procedures were approved by the Institutional
Review Boards of the participating school district and
the authors’ university. Using a random-numbers
table generated prior to initiating the study, partici

pants were randomized to either MVMC or to the
control condition immediately after completing the
baseline assessment. They were then informed of the
condition they were assigned to, and those assigned to
the MVMC condition were scheduled for their
MVMC session. MVMC sessions were scheduled
after school, based on student and facilitator availability, once at least 2 students assigned to the MVMC
condition were available for a particular session time
(so that the sessions could be conducted in groups of at
least 2). On average, students randomized to MVMC
attended the session approximately 1 week after the
baseline assessment (M = 8.5 days, SD = 5.9). A total
of 14 MVMC groups were conducted. Groups ranged
in size from 2 to 4 participants and had, on average,
3.3 participants (SD = 0.7).
Because repeated assessments of victimization
experiences covering shorter periods of time can
provide more valid data on victimization than a
single assessment of experiences over a longer period
of time (Jouriles, McDonald, Garrido, Rosenfield, &
Brown, 2005), follow-up assessments were completed monthly for 3 months after baseline, via a secure
website. Participants received a $10 gift card to a
local store for each assessment and for the MVMC
session to compensate them for their time (possible


-----

total of $50). Participants in the control group were
allowed to participate in MVMC upon completion of
the final assessment to ensure that all participants
received the same potential benefits.
Overall, attrition was low (see Figure 1 for a
CONSORT diagram [Schulz, Altman, & Moher,
2010] outlining participant flow). Seventy-five percent
(35/47) of participants in the MVMC condition and
83% (30/36) in the control condition completed all
three follow-up assessments; 13% (6/47) in MVMC
and 11% (4/36) in the control condition completed at
least two follow-up assessments; 2% (1/47) in
MVMC and 6% (2/36) in the control condition
completed only one follow-up; and 11% (5/47) in
MVMC and 0 in the control condition completed no
follow-up assessments. Two of the five in MVMC
who did not provide follow-up data also did not
participate in the MVMC session. This resulted in a
final sample of 78 (42 in the MVMC condition and 36
in the control condition) for which we had data for at
least one follow-up assessment. There were no
differences between participants who completed the
study and those who did not on any of the measured
demographic or study variables.
In the state in which this study was conducted,
actual or suspected sexual violence perpetrated by
someone 17 years of age or older against a child must
be reported to the child welfare system, unless the age
difference between the perpetrator and child is no
more than 3 years. There were no such incidents
reported in this study (participants were not explicitly asked about violence perpetrated by adults and
none reported such violence to study staff).

My Voice, My Choice
MVMC was administered as a single 90-minute
group session. Groups of 2 to 4 participants received
training in assertive resistance skills from a female
facilitator and practiced skills in IVE simulations of
sexually threatening situations. The participants
experienced the IVE through the use of a virtualreality headset. The virtual environment for all
simulations was a virtual bedroom, in which the
participant was seated on a couch to the right of a
male avatar. In real space, the male actor, who also
provided the verbal component of the simulations,
was seated to the left of the participant, so that his
speech would be consistent with the position of the
virtual avatar. The actor controlled the avatar’s
movements and facial expressions using the computer program to coincide with his speech.
MVMC sessions began with approximately
30 minutes of discussion and modeling of assertive
resistance skills. The female facilitator led the
discussion and demonstrated assertive and nonassertive resistance in (nonvirtual) role-play interac

tions with the male actor. Next, the facilitator
introduced the practice portion of the session,
which lasted approximately 60 minutes. Each
participant completed three virtual simulations, in
which the actor engaged in verbal sexual coercion
of increasing levels of severity. Participants were
informed prior to beginning the simulations that
they would never be touched and that they could
stop a simulation at any time. The first simulation
was relatively easy; the actor engaged in only mild
coercion and stopped his behavior as soon as the
participant used assertive resistance. This allowed
the participants to become accustomed to the IVE,
to introduce them to enacting a simulation in the
presence of the other group members, and to have
an initial success experience using assertive resistance. The second and third simulations were more
challenging: The actor became increasingly aggressive in his speech and was more persistent in the
face of assertive resistance. After each simulation,
the participant received constructive feedback from
the female facilitator and fellow group members
(each participant completed different simulations at
each of the three levels so that participants would
not simply imitate each other). Feedback emphasized both what the participant did well and ideas
for additional ways to engage in assertive resistance
for the next simulation (e.g., use a firmer voice tone,
refuse without apologizing, etc.). Simulations were
2 to 3 minutes long, but could be repeated until the
participant successfully demonstrated assertive
resistance. Upon completion of the final set of
simulations, the facilitator led a concluding conversation about the experience and about the
program as a whole.

Facilitators and Training
The four female facilitators were clinical psychology doctoral students with at least one year of
clinical training. The four male actors were either
advanced undergraduate students or recent college
graduates. Facilitators and actors underwent approximately 20 hours of training, which included
information about interpersonal violence and
assertive resistance, review of video recordings of
prior groups, completion of a MVMC group as a
participant (for facilitators only), completion of
practice groups as a facilitator/actor with study
staff acting as participants, and training in research
ethics. Actors received training in each of the
simulations, including the context of the situation
to be simulated, the type of language to use, when
to escalate and cease coercive behavior (e.g., when
the participant effectively used assertive resistance
skills), and how severe coercion should be. Facilitators and actors were all trained to be sensitive to


-----

participant distress and to stop a simulation and
help a participant to begin the practice again if she
appeared unable to utilize assertive resistance skills.
If a participant became too distressed to continue,
facilitators and actors were instructed to refer her to
the high-school guidance counselor (this was never
necessary). Once facilitators and actors completed
training, they participated in weekly video-supervision of groups.

#### measures
Sexual and Nonsexual Violence Victimization
Participants completed the 25 victimization items
from the Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory (CADRI) at each assessment;
positive relationship items were interspersed with
the violence items to reduce the negative impact of
the questionnaire (positive items were not included
in these analyses). The CADRI is a reliable and
well-validated measure (Wolfe et al., 2001) that is
frequently utilized to assess violence in adolescent
relationships and measures five categories of
victimization. The sexual victimization (e.g., “A
boy touched me sexually when I didn’t want him
to”) and physical victimization (e.g., “A boy
slapped me or pulled my hair”) subscales each
contain four items. The remaining three subscales
measure psychological victimization: threatening
behavior (4 items, e.g., “A boy deliberately tried to
frighten me”), relational abuse (3 items, e.g., “A
boy spread rumors about me”), and verbal abuse
(10 items, e.g., “A boy ridiculed me or made fun of
me in front of others”). Although the CADRI was
originally developed to refer to incidents that
occurred within a dating relationship, we asked
participants to consider things that any boy had
done (“This could be a boyfriend or a boy you were
dating, a boy who is just a friend, or even a boy that
you didn’t know”) as teen relationships are often
ambiguous in definition (Madsen & Collins, 2011),
and we wanted to cast a broad net in measuring
violence victimization. We focused on acts committed by males because the intervention targets
male-to-female violence.
Participants rated the frequency of each item in
the past month at each of the follow-up assessments; however, because few items occurred more
than once at any assessment, item scores were
re-coded as 0 = Did not occur or 1 = Occurred.
At the baseline assessment, participants were
also asked whether each item had occurred at
any time, not just in the past month; also coded as
0 = Did not occur or 1 = Occurred. Subscale scores
were generated by summing the number of items
endorsed at any given assessment. However,
because participants rarely reported multiple items


of sexual victimization or physical victimization,
these subscale scores were re-coded as dichotomous
values for sexual victimization and for physical
victimization in the past month: 0 = Did not occur
or 1 = Occurred.
For psychological victimization, the three subscales (threatening behavior, relational abuse, and
verbal abuse) were combined into a single, overall
subscale. In contrast to sexual and physical
victimization, participants often reported multiple
items of psychological victimization, making it
possible to examine psychological victimization as
a continuous variable (coefficient alpha ranged
from .75 to .82).
Finally, to control for previous victimization, we
summed the lifetime reports of all items (sexual,
physical, and psychological) at the baseline assessment (coefficient alpha .88).

Psychological Distress
Participants completed the Trauma Symptom
Checklist (TSC; Elliott & Briere, 1992) at each
assessment to measure psychological distress. The
TSC is a reliable and well-validated measure that
has been used extensively in evaluations of adolescent mental health. Items from the PTSD, depressive, and anger control symptom scales were
included. Because scores were highly correlated
across the 3 domains at each assessment (correlations ranged from .45 to .80, all ps b .001), we
averaged them to obtain an overall distress t-score
(for the combined scale, .80 ≤ α ≤ .87 across the 4
assessments).

Participant Satisfaction and Engagement in MVMC
Participants in the MVMC condition completed a
5-item questionnaire after the group session (How
much did you enjoy the program? Would you
recommend it to other girls? Do you think the
program will be helpful to you in the future? Will
you use the skills you learned? How involved were
you during the program?). Items were rated on a
5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 = Not at All to
4 = Extremely. Using the same 5-point Likert scale,
the facilitator and actor who administered each
group also rated the degree to which each participant was (a) engaged and (b) involved in the group
discussion and the skills practice. Facilitator and
actor ratings were averaged separately.

Intervention Fidelity
MVMC sessions were video-recorded, and facilitator and actor adherence to the MVMC protocol
was rated by trained observers. Observers coded
the coverage of 20 key aspects of the program (e.g.,
discussing the definition of assertiveness, when and
why it is important to be assertive, and barriers to
engaging in assertive resistance; completion of 3


-----

sets of simulations with feedback and coaching for
each group member). Each element was coded as
0 = Absent or 1 = Present. Due to technical difficulties (failure to record the entire session), the full
group session could not be rated for fidelity for 6 of
the 14 groups (43%). Since the elements of the
program were always administered in the same
order, the average score across all available items
(i.e., items for the elements that were recorded) was
calculated.

#### data analytic approach
Ideally, outcome data for all participants who were
randomized to a condition would be included in the
final analyses, regardless of whether they completed
the condition to which they were assigned (i.e.,
intention to treat). However, as with most randomized trials, some participants did not provide
outcome data (in this case, 5/83; 6%). Alshurafa
and colleagues (2012) outline several options for
addressing missing outcome data (MOD): (a)
Individuals with MOD not considered in the
analysis (complete/available case analysis); (b)
Imputation of MOD; or (c) A combination of the
first two approaches. We utilized the latter. First,
we examined the results for the 78 participants who
completed at least one follow-up assessment (the
unimputed sample); second, we utilized EM
imputation based on baseline data to impute
missing outcomes (data for 31/218 [12%] potential
assessments) and provide results for an imputed
sample of 83.
We utilized multi-level modeling (MLM) to test
our hypotheses (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). Maas
and Hox (2005) have demonstrated that multi-level
modeling (MLM) produces unbiased regression
coefficients (treatment effects) in samples as small
as 30. Thus, the study was sufficiently powered to
evaluate treatment effects using MLM. The three
follow-up assessments (Level 1) were nested within
individuals (Level 2). A grand-mean centered

Table 1
Baseline Descriptive Statistics


measure of time since the first follow-up assessment, in weeks, was included at Level 1 to control
for any temporal change in the dependent variables
during the follow-up period. Since sexual and
physical victimization were examined dichotomously (0 = Did Not Occur, 1 = Occurred), analyses with these dependent variables were conducted
using a Bernoulli distribution with population-average results. Given the greater number of acts of
psychological victimization reported, this variable
was examined continuously, as was the measure of
psychological distress. Robust standard errors are
reported throughout.
Following Singer and Willett (2003), we computed
effect sizes by calculating the percent of between-subjects (level 2) unexplained variability that was
accounted for by the main or interaction effect (that
is, the percent of individual differences in occurrence
of the dependent variable during the follow-up period
that can be explained by the main or interaction
effect). Due to evidence that age, relationship status,
race/ethnicity, and psychological distress are associated with violence victimization and assertive resistance
(Ackard & Neumark-Sztainer, 2002; U.S. Department of Justice, 2006; Yoshioka, 2000), all four
variables were controlled at Level 2. The independent
variables were intervention condition (0 = Control,
1 = MVMC), prior victimization, and the Condition ×
Prior Victimization interaction. All IVs were grandmean centered.

### Results
#### preliminary analyses
Descriptive statistics and baseline group comparisons are presented in Table 1. At baseline, 35% (29/
83) of participants reported at least one incident of
lifetime sexual victimization and 35% (29/83)
reported at least one incident of lifetime physical
victimization. Participants reported an average of
5.22 (SD = 3.91) items of lifetime psychological
victimization at baseline (range: 0–14). Average

baseline psychological distress was in the nonclinical range (t-score b 60), (M = 47.00, SD = 6.60),
but 19% (n = 16/83) of participants reported
symptoms in the clinical range (t-score ≥ 60) on
at least one of the three composite measures of
psychological distress. As expected, prior sexual
victimization was positively correlated with prior
physical (r = .26, p = .02) and psychological (r = .48,
p b .001) victimization, and baseline psychological
distress was positively correlated with prior sexual
(r = .47, p b .001), physical (r = .34, p b .001), and
psychological (r = .50, p b .001) victimization. The
intervention and control groups did not differ on any
of the demographic or study variables at baseline.
MVMC participants were quite satisfied with the
program, M = 3.72, SD = .29, and their engagement
was rated as moderate by facilitators, M = 2.89,
SD = .76, and actors, M = 2.68, SD = .63 (both on a
0–4 scale). Intervention fidelity was strong, M = .95,
SD = .06 (on a 0–1 scale).

#### intervention effects
Sexual Victimization
Utilizing the non-imputed sample, 15% (12/78) of
participants reported at least one incident of sexual
victimization during the 3-month follow-up period.
Within the MVMC condition, 10% (4/42) of
participants reported sexual victimization, compared
to 22% (8/36) in the control condition. MLM

MVMC Effects on Sexual and Nonsexual Victimization

Victimization Type


analyses (first two columns of Table 2) revealed a
main effect of condition: MVMC participants were
less likely to report sexual victimization during
follow-up than were participants in the control
group, b = − .77, OR = .47, t(70) = − 2.29, p b .05.
The percent of unexplained variability between
subjects accounted for by treatment condition was
35.4%. That is, approximately 35% of individual
differences in the occurrence of sexual victimization
over the 3-month follow-up period was explained by
assignment to condition. In addition, baseline psychological distress was positively associated with
sexual victimization during follow-up, b = .09,
OR = 1.10, t(70) = 3.87, p b .001.
Within the imputed sample, 16% (13/83) of
participants reported sexual victimization; 4/47
(9%) in the MVMC condition and 9/36 (25%) in
the control condition. Analysis of the imputed
sample (presented in italics below the non-imputed
sample in Table 2) yielded an identical pattern of
results as the analysis of the non-imputed sample.

Physical Victimization
Twenty-two percent (17/78) of participants in the
non-imputed sample reported physical victimization during the follow-up period; 21% (9/42) of
those in the MVMC condition and 22% (8/36) in
the control condition. As shown in the second two

was associated with occurrence of physical victimization during the follow-up period. The imputed
sample provided an estimate of 21% (17/83)
occurrence of physical victimization (19%, 9/47,
in the MVMC condition and 22%, 8/36, in the
control condition). Again, as shown in Table 2,
none of the Level-2 variables was associated with
the occurrence of physical victimization during the
follow-up period.

Psychological Victimization
The majority of participants in the non-imputed
sample (73%, 57/78) reported at least one item of
psychological victimization during follow-up, with a
mean of 1.67 items, SD = 1.94, range: 0–8. As shown
in the final column of Table 2, although there was no
main effect of condition, there was a main effect of
prior victimization, b = .13, t(70) = 3.52, p b .001
(9.1% of unexplained variability was accounted
for by prior victimization), and a Condition ×
Prior Victimization interaction effect, b = − .19,
t(70) = − 2.86, p b .01 (11.9% of unexplained
variability in psychological victimization). In the
imputed sample, 81% (67/83) of participants reported at least one incident of psychological victimization
(mean = 1.65, SD = 1.87, range: 0–8). MLM results
were nearly identical for the imputed sample.
The non-imputed interaction is presented graphically in Figure 2A; greater prior victimization was
associated with greater psychological victimization
during the follow-up period for those in the control
condition, but not for those in the MVMC
condition. That is, for participants at lower risk
for future victimization (those with lower prior
victimization), MVMC did not reduce risk for
victimization during follow-up. However, for those
participants at higher risk for future victimization,
MVMC was associated with less psychological
victimization during follow-up.

Psychological Distress
Average psychological distress during follow-up
was 43.15, SD = 5.76, range: 36–62; approximately 12% (n = 9/78) of participants reported clinically significant distress (t-score N 60) on one of the
three composite scales at least once during the
follow-up period. To examine effects of MVMC on
psychological distress, we repeated our analyses,
using psychological distress as the dependent
variable, and adding a Condition × Baseline
Psychological Distress interaction term to determine if MVMC had different effects depending on
initial distress. As expected, psychological distress
at baseline was positively associated with psychological distress at follow-up, b = .48, SE = .10,
t(69) = 4.87, p b .001. There was no main effect of
condition, b = .31, SE = .95, t(69) = .33, p = .74, or


previous victimization, b = .20, SE = .13, t(69) =
1.52, p = .13. However, prior victimization moderated the association between condition and psychological distress, b = − .55, SE = .28, t(69) = 1.96,
p = .05; the interaction accounted for 10.6% of
unexplained between-subjects variability in psychological distress. Baseline psychological distress did
not moderate the association between condition and
follow-up psychological distress, however, b = .31,
SE = .22, t(69) = 1.39, p = .17. In addition, the
average level of psychological distress declined
during follow-up, b = − .29, SE = .05, t(77) = 5.52,
p b .001. As shown in Figure 2B (based on
non-imputed sample), program effects on psychological distress paralleled those for psychological
victimization: There was no effect of MVMC for
participants with low prior victimization, but for
participants with greater prior victimization,
MVMC was associated with lower psychological
distress.
In the imputed sample, average psychological
distress was 43.03, SD = 5.53, range: 36–62. The
pattern of effects using the imputed sample was
almost identical for psychological distress at baseline,
b = .50, SE = .09, t(74) = 5.39, p b .001, condition,
b = .17, SE = .12, t(74) = 1.41, p = .16, previous
victimization, b = .17, SE = .12, t(74) = 1.41, p =.16,
Condition × Previous Victimization, = b = − .52,
SE = .27, t(74) = 1.96, p = .05, Condition × Psychological Distress at Baseline, b = .29, SE = .22, t(74) =
1.34, p = .18, and the longitudinal change in psychological distress during the follow-up period, b = −.29,
SE = .04, t(82) = 6.41, p b .001.

### Discussion
Our findings suggest that MVMC, which consists of a
single 90-minute session that teaches adolescent girls
how to assertively resist unwanted sexual advances
and gives them opportunities to practice these skills in
an IVE, can reduce risk of sexual victimization for a
3-month period following the intervention. We believe
this line of research provides important support for
prevention efforts that target risk-reduction by
training girls to use assertive resistance skills. Combined with previous work in this area (Gidycz et al.,
2001; Simpson Rowe et al., 2012), the results suggest
that providing the opportunity to practice and master
assertive resistance skills may help adolescent girls to
avoid and/or escape potentially threatening interpersonal situations. It is important to highlight, however,
that the number of girls who were sexually victimized
during the follow-up period was quite small (8 out of
36 participants in the waitlist condition and 4 out of
42 in the MVMC condition). Thus, although these
results arepromising, they are based on small numbers
and should be interpreted with caution.


-----

FIGURE 2 Effects of MVMC on psychological victimization and psychological distress during
the follow-up period.


Our results also suggest that MVMC can reduce
risk for psychological victimization and psychological distress, but only among those girls with
relatively higher levels of prior victimization. This
finding is particularly noteworthy because other
violence prevention programs have generally been
ineffective or less effective for previously victimized
young women (Morrison et al., 2004). It is not clear
from this study why MVMC had stronger effects on
psychological victimization and psychological distress among girls with higher levels of previous
victimization. One possibility is a floor effect; that
is, girls with lower prior victimization were less
vulnerable to future psychological victimization
and psychological distress to begin with, so
differences between MVMC and the control
condition could not be detected over a brief
follow-up period. Alternatively, the messages sent
by MVMC may have been particularly useful for


previously victimized girls. Specifically, MVMC
emphasizes that girls have a right to stand up for
themselves and that violent or coercive behavior is
never acceptable. Combined with enhanced feelings
of self-efficacy and empowerment as a result of
mastering the assertive resistance skills, this message may have been particularly valuable for more
vulnerable girls and may have had positive effects
on behavior across situations as well as on general
psychological well-being. It is also possible that
some of these positive outcomes were intertwined.
That is, reductions in victimization may have
contributed to reduced psychological distress simply by reducing the presence of a significant
stressor.
This study had a number of important strengths,
including the randomized controlled design and a
high participant retention rate. There were, however, several limitations. Specifically, the 3-month


-----

follow-up period was short, and the sample for this
pilot study was small, especially for examining
moderators of program effects. Indeed, the combination of a 3-month follow-up period and small
sample resulted in only 12 participants reporting
sexual victimization during the follow-up period.
Although the results of this study suggest positive
effects of MVMC, it will be important to replicate
these findings in a larger sample over a longer
period of time.
There were other limitations as well. The use of a
wait-list control group does not allow us to rule out
the possibility that observed effects were due to
nonspecific treatment factors or participant expectancies, as opposed to the assertive resistance skills
taught during MVMC sessions. Moreover, measurement of program effects focused on victimization
experiences, and did not include a direct assessment
of assertive resistance, or assessment of whether
participants successfully avoided sexually threatening situations (e.g., assertively resisted pressure to be
alone with a boy before he had a chance to engage in
sexual pressure). As a result, it is not clear why sexual
victimization rates decreased in the MVMC condition, compared to the control condition. Furthermore, findings were based solely on self-report data.
Confidence in our findings would be bolstered if we
were able to provide evidence of reduced victimization from other data sources as well (e.g., official
records). In addition, it is possible that aspects of
campus climate might influence program results, and
it is not clear if effects are generalizable across
different school environments (e.g., public schools
that include males and females).
It should be acknowledged that MVMC does not
differ from certain other programs in terms of the
primary message (i.e., sexual violence is prevalent
and dangerous, and assertive resistance is an effective
self-protection tool) (Anderson & Whiston, 2005;
Morrison et al., 2004). Where it does differ is in its
emphasis on the behavioral practice of assertive
resistance skills and the use of an IVE. Specifically,
participants were given multiple opportunities to
practice the skills in realistically simulated sexually
coercive situations, followed by feedback and the
opportunity to immediately apply that feedback in
subsequent practice. Such an approach is supported
by skill training in many other domains (de Winter et
al., 2012; Lane et al., 2008; Van Hasselt et al., 2008)
and seems likely to be an important area for future
violence prevention efforts.
In conclusion, if a 90-minute intervention can
indeed reduce violence victimization and psychological distress for adolescent girls, this line of research is
potentially of great significance. Important next steps
include evaluating MVMC with a larger sample and


over a longer period of time and examining potential
mediators of effects (i.e., we hypothesize that
assertive resistance skills mediate the effects of
MVMC on victimization, but were not able to test
that hypothesis in this sample). We also hope to
explore its efficacy with other age groups (e.g., before
younger girls begin dating and among young women
who already have an established pattern of dating
and sexual relationships) as well as with males. Boys
and men can be victims of sexual violence as well as
perpetrators (U.S. Department of Justice, 2006), and
training and practice of assertive resistance skills in
IVEs may help them to effectively resist sexual
pressure as well as to increase awareness of and
sensitivity to refusal cues from others.
