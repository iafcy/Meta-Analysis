**Abstract**
**Introduction Interpersonal violence is a critical public**
health concern in humanitarian contexts, but evidence
of effective violence prevention programmes targeting
adolescent girls is lacking. We investigated the efficacy
of a life skills and safe spaces programme to reduce
adolescent girls’ experiences of interpersonal violence in a
refugee setting.
**Methods In this two-arm, single-blinded, cluster**
randomised controlled trial, we recruited 919 Sudanese
and South Sudanese girls ages 13–19 years residing
in refugee camps in Ethiopia. Girls were divided into 31
clusters, with 457 and 462 participants assigned to the
intervention and control arms, respectively. Intervention
clusters received 30 life skills sessions delivered in safe
spaces and 8 complementary sessions for caregivers.
The primary outcome was exposure to sexual violence in
the previous 12 months. Secondary outcomes included
disaggregated forms of sexual violence, physical violence,
emotional violence, transactional sex, child marriage,
feelings of safety, attitudes around rites of passage and
perceptions of social support. Intent-to-treat analysis was
used.
**Results At 12-month follow-up, the intervention was**
not significantly associated with reduction in exposure to
sexual violence (adjusted OR =0.96, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.57),
other forms of violence, transactional sex or feelings of
safety. The intervention was associated with improvements
in attitudes around rites of passage and identified social
supports. Additionally, the intervention showed a decrease
in reported child marriage among girls who were married
at baseline.
**Conclusion While the intervention impacted key markers**
along the causal pathway to violence reduction, further
research and programmatic adaptations are needed to
prevent violence towards adolescents in humanitarian
contexts.
**Trial registration NCT02506543.**

**Introduction**
Throughout adolescence, individuals
face unique and critical threats to health,
well-being and security.[1] Globally, adolescence marks the period of greatest risk of


interpersonal violence victimisation for
girls.[2 3] Girls reaching reproductive age are
vulnerable to multiple forms of violence,
including child maltreatment, intimate
partner violence (IPV), child marriage, sexual
abuse and exploitation and female genital
mutilation/cutting.[4 5] Additionally, adolescent girls’ low position in many societies may
exacerbate risks of victimisation and impede
service access and utilisation. These risks may
be amplified by frequently occurring political
and social upheaval during emergencies.[6 7]

Experiencing violence during childhood and adolescence can disrupt development trajectories, with greater impact than


**Key questions**


**What is already known?**

- While life skills programming has been identified as
a promising intervention strategy to prevent gender-based violence in low-income and middle-income countries, it is currently unknown whether
this strategy’s potential extends to humanitarian
settings.

**What are the new findings?**

- While we found no evidence that the Creating
Opportunities through Mentorship, Parental
Involvement, and Safe Spaces intervention reduced girls’ exposure to sexual violence within the
12-month timeframe measured, findings indicate
positive impact of the intervention on attitudes
around rites of passage and social support indicators.

- Findings also showed a decrease in reports of child
marriage among girls in the intervention who reported being married or living with a man at baseline.

**What do the new findings imply?**

- Given the complexities of running randomised controlled trials in humanitarian contexts, outcome
measures may need to be tailored to align with realistic timelines and the realities of programming in
emergency settings.

exposure at other periods in the life course.[8 10] Indeed,
multiple forms of gender-based violence (GBV) experienced during childhood and adolescence are associated with long-term health consequences for females,
including poor sexual and reproductive health, increased
risk of HIV, physical injury and disability, poor mental
well-being and suicidal ideation.[11–15] Given that suicide
and depressive disorders are the leading global causes
of mortality and years lost to disability, respectively, for
adolescent girls ages 15–19 years, reducing exposure
to violence and promoting positive development may
decrease the burden of mental ill-health and improve
general health and well-being for adolescent girls.[16 17]

Life skills and education interventions have demonstrated promising changes in adolescent girls’ violence-related attitudes and behaviours in developing settings.[18 19]
These interventions have identified social norms related
to gender and violence, adolescent girl empowerment
and social networks, as pathways for reducing risk of
GBV. Interventions have included safe spaces and combinations of life skills training, awareness-raising around
girls’ rights and violence and social network building.[20]
A few interventions have also included influential adults
in girls’ lives, such as caregivers, or facilitated access to a
young female mentor.[19 21]

To date, programming to prevent violence against
adolescent girls in humanitarian settings has been
limited. A recent systematic review of approaches to
reducing GBV against adolescent girls in humanitarian
settings found only three evaluations in the academic
literature, all of which used weak pretest and post-test
designs.[22] Additionally, none of the 38 adolescent IPV
prevention interventions identified in a recent Cochrane
review were implemented in humanitarian settings.[23] As
suggested by these reviews, significant knowledge gaps
persist around effective strategies for reducing experiences of violence and promoting positive development
for adolescent girls in humanitarian settings.
To address this gap in evidence and practice, Columbia
University and the International Rescue Committee
(IRC) investigated the efficacy of the Creating Opportunities through Mentorship, Parental Involvement,
and Safe Spaces (COMPASS) adolescent life skills and
safe spaces programme for refugee adolescent girls. To
our knowledge, this study contributes the first rigorous
scientific learning of an intervention to reduce GBV and
support empowerment of adolescent girls in a humanitarian setting. This study presents the results of a cluster
randomised controlled trial to determine the impact of
the COMPASS programme on experiencing interpersonal violence, social support and psychosocial outcomes
for refugee adolescent girls living in Ethiopia.

**Methods**
**Study design and participants**
COMPASS is a programme implemented with refugees living in camps on the Sudan/Ethiopia border,


conflict-affected communities in eastern Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) and displaced populations
in northeast Pakistan. Columbia University evaluated
COMPASS in all three locations, each of which had a
different research objective and design. In Ethiopia, the
impact evaluation studied whether the core programme
components had an impact on girls’ experiences of
violence and social outcomes. The DRC study measured
the incremental impact of a caregiver curriculum on girls’
experiences of violence and social outcomes, along with
attitudes and characteristics of participating caregivers. In
Pakistan, the evaluation assessed the acceptability of the
programme to adolescent girls and parents/caregivers in
their context and measured changes in girls’ social and
health outcomes over the course of the programme.[24]
This article presents findings from the evaluation implemented in Ethiopia.
In this wait-list, cluster randomised controlled trial
[(see online supplementary file – CONSORT cluster trials](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2018-000825)
[checklist), adolescent girls ages 13–19 years were recruited](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2018-000825)
from three refugee camps in the Benishangul-Gumuz
regional state of Ethiopia. Ethiopia is a top asylum destination for refugees fleeing protracted conflicts in nearby
countries, and Benishangul-Gumuz camps host tens of
thousands of refugees from Sudan and South Sudan.
Adolescent refugees from Sudan have been repeatedly
found to exhibit elevated rates of depression, anxiety and
post-traumatic stress.[25] Additionally, a recent study from
other Ethiopian refugee camps revealed that adolescent
refugee girls are at risk of physical, emotional and sexual
violence victimisation in this setting.[26]

Adolescents who met inclusion criteria were enrolled
in the study from 29 July 2015 to 4 September 2016. Girls
were excluded if they lacked verbal proficiency in Funj,
Regarig, Engesena, or Maban. Language exclusion criteria
were based on the primary languages spoken by girls in
the research camps and data collectors’ language abilities. Individuals with significant cognitive impairments
or physical disabilities that would prevent independent
completion of interviews using Audio Computer-Assisted
Self-Interview (ACASI) were excluded for ethical reasons.
All study procedures were approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the Columbia University Medical Center
[(Protocol #AAAP6855; see online supplementary file](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2018-000825)
[– IRB protocol), the Administration for Refugee and](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2018-000825)
Returnee Affairs in Ethiopia and the IRC’s internal
review board (Protocol # WPE 1.00.003).

**Study procedures**
IRC staff introduced the intervention to adolescent
girls and their caregivers through home visits and
existing programming at IRC’s Women and Girls Wellness Centers. Girls who registered for the intervention
were invited to participate in the study by data collectors who were not affiliated with the IRC programme
and who were managed by Columbia University. Data
collection trainers were all affiliated with the Care and
Protection of Children Learning Network, and training


-----

included special attention to data collection with young
people derived from a series of guidance materials.[27–29]
All research staff participated in a training focused on
ensuring privacy and confidentiality and understanding
the basic elements of GBV as outlined in the WHO’s
guidelines on violence against women research. Data
collectors signed confidentiality agreements and developed protocols for data breaches.[30] In accordance with
ethical protocols for research in non-written languages,
data collectors obtained verbal consent in confidential spaces from guardians, adolescent girls over age 18
years, and married girls below age 18 years, and assent for
unmarried girls age 13–17 years. Adolescents self-administered the survey, using ACASI programming in a private
location.[30 31] Data collectors remained outside confidential spaces to respond to questions and to troubleshoot
any technological difficulties. Following the interview,
participants were provided with information on how to
access violence and psychosocial support services, and
referrals were made to service providers as needed.
Given that girls received the COMPASS intervention
in small programme groups, we used these groups to
cluster treatment assignments. Following completion of
baseline data collection, adolescents were divided into 62
programme clusters of 10–20 girls based on household
proximity, age (13–14 years or 15–19 years) and primary
language. Columbia University randomised clusters to
the treatment or wait-list control arm using a uniform
distribution in R. To reduce contamination potential,
siblings were randomised to the same treatment arm.
Given the nature of programming received in the intervention arm, randomisation was blinded to data collectors but not blinded for participants.
Participants in both treatment arms were tracked and
retained through strategies such as brief home visits
occurring 6 months after baseline data collection and
a visit 1 month prior to endline survey administration.
To ensure the girls completing the endline surveys were
the same as those from baseline, identifying information
was first checked against a master list from baseline. Girls
were then asked a series of questions about their baseline
interview, such as what materials were used and where
interviews were held. Adolescents completed the endline
survey approximately 1 year after completion of the baseline survey (July–September 2016). Nested qualitative
data were also collected and are presented elsewhere.[32 33]
All data collection took place in empty classrooms in local
schools.

**COMPASS intervention**
Previous IRC learning on programming for children and
adolescent girls informed intervention development.
Intervention components included weekly adolescent
girl life skills sessions in safe spaces, with 45–60 min of
facilitated content and 30 min of unstructured time.
Adolescents in clusters randomised to the treatment
arm received a total of 30 in-person group sessions.
Each girl’s life skills session focused on topics related to


improving key skills such as communication, friendship
building, and awareness of GBV and sexual and repro[ductive health (see online supplementary appendix A.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2018-000825)
Girls’ sessions were delivered by trained female refugee
mentors aged 18–30 years, who spoke the same languages
as participants. Groups were led by either one mentor or
a team of two or three mentors.
The intervention also included 8 monthly discussion
groups for enrolled girls’ caregivers, which covered
topics such as communication skills, supporting adolescent girls and understanding violence and abuse. Caregiver content was delivered by IRC staff with assistance
from translators. Safe spaces were accessible to all women
and girls living in the camps for unstructured activities in
between COMPASS sessions.[30]

The COMPASS theory of change hypothesised that
weekly discussion sessions for adolescent girls, access
to a trusted female mentor and provision of safe singlegender space would increase girls’ human, social, physical
and financial assets to protect themselves from a range
of potential risks, including IPV, community violence
and transactional sex, as well as respond to threats or
incidents of such violence (see figure 1). Building on
previous experience with the Parents Make a Difference
programme with younger children, it was also theorised
that including caregivers could increase their protective
role in girls’ lives both within and outside the home,
by raising their awareness about the risks of GBV faced
by adolescent girls in their care and the importance of
connecting girls with GBV response and health services.[28]

**Measures**
Primary outcomes
The primary outcome of interest was a binary composite
representing any form of sexual violence in the previous
12 months, which included self-reported forced sex,
unwanted sexual touching or coerced sex.

Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes included binary self-reported
12-month exposure to forced sex (having sex unwillingly), unwanted sexual touching and coerced sex in
the previous 12 months. These measures are the disaggregated components of the primary outcome and were
adapted from previously validated questionnaires.[34]
Other secondary outcomes included binary self-reported
12-month exposure to physical violence, emotional
violence, transactional sex, child marriage and feelings
of safety. Physical violence was operationalised as being
hit or beaten. Emotional violence was defined as being
screamed at loudly or aggressively. Engagement in transactional sex was operationalised as exchanging sex for
money, food or gifts. Child marriage was defined as
marrying or living with someone as if married prior to
18 years of age. Adolescents similarly provided binary
responses on their feelings of safety in their homes,
schools, friend’s homes and neighbour’s homes. Each of
these variables on self-reported safety was operationalised

as answering ‘yes’ to questions such as ‘Do you feel safe at
_home?’ and ‘Do you feel safe at school?’ and in a range of_
other settings where the IRC thought feelings of safety
might be increased as a result of programming.

Key causal pathway markers
Key markers thought to influence girls’ risk of experiencing interpersonal violence included social support
and attitudes regarding rites of passage. Perceived social
support was captured through dichotomous self-report of
having female friends of a similar age outside the family
and reports of having a trusted non-family female adult
in whom they could confide. Rites of passage included
adolescents’ beliefs about the highest grade girls should
complete in school, acceptability for girls to work outside
the home after marriage, appropriate age of marriage
and appropriate age of having one’s first child. Continuous measures for appropriate age of marriage and age
of first child were dichotomised as either under age 18
years or age 18 years and above. Adolescents also self-reported access to a safe place to spend time with other
girls.

Demographic variables
Age and years of completed education were continuous
variables. Cohabitation with biological parents was operationalised as a categorical variable: presence of only the
father, only the mother, both parents, or neither parent
in the home. Cohabitation with an intimate partner was


defined as living with a husband or living with someone
as if married.

**Statistical analysis**
The target sample size was originally calculated assuming
20 girls in each cluster; however, programme realities in
the field led to fewer girls being assigned to each group
and thus necessitated a recalculation of our sample size.
We assumed 30% incidence of past-year sexual violence
among the population at baseline and that this incidence
was likely to remain constant among the control group.
To calculate the target sample size, we assumed statistical
power of 80% and a two-sided alpha of 0.05 to detect
a 35% reduction in the incidence of past-year sexual
violence in the intervention arm compared with the waitlist arm. We estimated that each cluster would comprise
approximately 15 girls. We assumed an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.06 to account for clustering.
We could not find a previous study that measured sexual
violence among female adolescents in a sub-Saharan
African site. However, a study that assessed IPV perpetrated against females ages 15–49 years across multiple
sites, including Ethiopia, reported all ICCs were less than
0.06.[35] We required 62 clusters, 31 groups in each treatment arm. We expected a 10% loss to follow-up, necessitating a final sample size of at least 896 girls.
Ranges, frequencies, means and SD were assessed for

tests were used to examine the independence of continuous and dichotomous baseline characteristics, respectively, between treatment arms and between those who
were and were not lost to follow-up. Intent-to-treat analysis was conducted on all individuals surveyed at baseline. Per-protocol analysis is not presented due to the
fact that more than 95% of girls and 91% of caregivers
followed protocol, defined as attending at least 75%
of programme sessions. The intervention’s effects on
binary primary and secondary outcomes at endline were
assessed through mixed effects logistic regressions with
random intercepts to account for clustering; the intervention’s effect on a continuous secondary outcome was
assessed using a linear mixed model. After estimating the
first-order effect of the intervention on these outcomes,
models were adjusted for baseline age, previous engagement in a romantic relationship and presence of mother,
father or both parents in the home. These demographic
characteristics were previously found to be associated
with experiences of violence in baseline results of this
study sample.[36]

Given attrition between baseline and follow-up and the
self-reported and sensitive nature of many of the questions, outcomes were missing for approximately 10%–20%
of girls. Pearson χ[2] tests were used to assess whether missingness was associated with treatment assignment. We
also carried out a sensitivity analysis by performing the
analysis described above on imputed data. To account for
the missing predictors and outcomes, we used a multiple

imputation approach. A set of five imputations was generated in Stata with ‘mi impute’, after which the average
values represented a close estimate of a full dataset. All
analyses were completed using Stata V.14.

**Results**
Of the 986 adolescent girls approached between 29
July 2015 and 4 September 2015, 919 girls completed
the baseline survey (see figure 2). Adolescents were
divided into clusters based on age, common language
and geographic location, with an average of 15 girls per
cluster. Thirty-one clusters were randomised to the intervention (n=457) and 31 clusters were randomised to the
waitlist arm (n=462). Of these, 812 (88·36%) participants
completed the endline survey between 25 July 2016 and 2
September 2016, and all 62 clusters were included in the
analysis. The most frequently cited reason for non-completion of an endline survey was relocation out of the
camps (n=37). Additionally, 34 girls from the control
group mistakenly joined the intervention and, due to
an error in the field, endline data were not collected for
these girls.
The average participant was approximately 14.5 years
and had 2 years of schooling. At baseline, adolescents in
the intervention group were more likely to live with their
mother but not father and less likely to live with neither
parent at baseline, as compared with the control group
(table 1). Information on perpetrators of violence at
baseline has been reported separately.[36] The proportion

of adolescents speaking the four different languages also
differed between the intervention and control groups,
which was an expected effect of randomising siblings to
the same treatment condition. Adolescents in the intervention and control groups did not differ on any other
measured demographic characteristics or primary or
secondary violence outcomes.
Baseline data revealed high levels of exposure to any
form of past-year sexual violence: 28% of girls in the
intervention arm and 30% of girls in the control arm
reported experiencing any form of sexual violence in
the past year. Table 2 summarises primary and secondary
outcomes by treatment arm and time period of data
collection and treatment. There were no differences in
primary or secondary outcomes between the treatment
and wait-list control groups at baseline. Additionally, girls
were no more or less likely to have missing outcome data
at endline based on treatment arm.
Due to unforeseen challenges associated with
programme adaptation and implementation, the
COMPASS intervention roll-out was delayed, and the
reference period for the primary outcome thus extends to
the beginning of the programme. As such, the secondary
outcomes presented may be more relevant and appropriate, given the condensed timeline. While a third


round of data collection was sought to assess longer term
changes in violence reduction, this additional round of
data collection was ultimately not possible due to funding
limitations.
Analyses showed no significant effect of the intervention on reports of sexual violence (adjusted OR
(aOR)=0.96, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.57) in the previous 12
months, when adjusting for other covariates (see table 3).
The ICC for sexual violence in our sample was 0.009.
Analyses also showed no significant effect of the intervention on reports of specific forms of sexual violence,
physical violence, emotional violence or transactional
sex in the previous 12 months, as well as no effect on
perceived feelings of safety (see table 3). While there was
no difference in child marriage across treatment arms at
endline, exploratory analyses revealed the intervention
had an effect on child marriage for the subgroup of girls
already married at baseline; among those married or
living with someone as if married at baseline, girls in the
treatment arm had lower odds (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.34 to
0.95), p=0.032) of being married at endline as compared
with those in the control arm (results not presented in
table 3).
Adolescents in the intervention reported that they
believed girls should complete one additional year of

schooling as compared with those in the control group
(β=1.08, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.761), p=0.001). Girls in
the treatment arm also had greater odds than girls in
the control arm of believing a girl should get married
(aOR=1.88, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.28, p=0.027), and have
her first child after age 18 (aOR=2.04, 95% CI 1.25 to
3.34, p=0.005). Finally, girls in the intervention had 1.71
greater odds (95% CI (1.18 to 2.49, p=0.005) of reporting
having friends their own age and 1.997 greater odds (95%
CI 1.44 to 2.76, p<0.001) of having a trusted non-family
female adult in their life, when adjusting for other covariates. All findings are robust to sensitivity analyses (see
[online supplementary appendix B).](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2018-000825)

**Discussion**
The COMPASS intervention’s theory of change, built on
learnings from The Parents Make a Difference programme
and other studies, hypothesised that increasing girls’ knowledge of violence risk factors, reshaping attitudes about
gender roles, expanding social networks and improving
decision-making and negotiation skills would ultimately


equip girls to protect themselves against and respond to
violence.[30] While self-reported exposure to the primary
outcome of sexual violence did decrease in both the
control and intervention groups, we find no evidence that
this decline was due to the intervention. However, although
the programme did not impact girls’ likelihood of experiencing sexual, physical or emotional violence, or transactional sex within the timeframe measured, our results
suggest that the intervention did affect changes in gender
attitudes and social support networks, which lie earlier
along the causal pathway.
These results may reflect a need for a longer period of
follow-up to document changes in violence, or may reflect
a limited ability of the intervention to impact violence
outcomes. It may be unreasonable to expect these standalone interventions to impact outcomes at every stage of
the causal pathway, especially in a 12-month period, when
there are many other structural factors that influence a
girl’s risk of experiencing violence. Leveraging opportunities for policy change through work with local leaders
and other implementing organisations may expand the

intervention’s effectiveness.[29] Since caregivers and girls’
intimate partners are frequent perpetrators of violence,
including gender-transformative programming that
targets these two groups may also improve reach of the
intervention. Indeed, research indicates positive effects of
community-level advocacy and social norms interventions
on preventing IPV among women and parenting interventions targeting fathers on violence against children;
similar programme adaptations and expansions for adolescent girls may strengthen positive outcomes of life skills
programming like COMPASS.[37–39] Furthermore, given that
the inclusion of activities to target broader social norms
in the community may promote positive and sustainable
outcomes for girls and families, future evaluations of such
programme should consider including measures of change
at the community level, rather than just at the level of the
girl participants.
Additionally, future programme might benefit from
targeting social norms and behaviours among men in
the community. Qualitative research activities conducted
at baseline, including a participatory mapping exercise
in which female adolescents were asked to draw their


communities and identify ‘safe’ and ‘unsafe’ spaces,
revealed the perceived threat of spaces that are dominated
by male presence.[32] Furthermore, girls agreed that most
places are not inherently dangerous, but rather they pose a
threat to girls’ safety when occupied by men. However, this
activity masked the incidence of caregiver and domestic
violence in the private sphere as revealed through quantitative data collection, speaking to the importance of
mixed methods in understanding the complexities of girls’
experiences in these settings.[40] Similar qualitative research
should be conducted ahead of future programme in order
to elucidate a topology of unsafe spaces as well as girls’
perceived and real risks. Qualitative scenarios delivered
through in-depth interviews are also recommended.[33]

Additional exploratory analyses of these data showed
that the intervention was associated with a reduction in
child marriage among girls who were married or living
with someone as if married prior to age 18 years at baseline. These findings may indicate actual changes in adolescent girls’ marital status due to increased awareness about
the harms of child marriage or that social desirability bias
made girls less likely to report being married at endline.


-----

Anecdotal validation from IRC staff confirmed that many
girls who were living with partners as if married left these
relationships over the course of the intervention period,
underscoring that programme like COMPASS may offer
greater benefits to some girls than others and such subgroup
analyses are important in recognition that adolescent girls’
experiences in humanitarian settings are not uniform.
A previous _Lancet review of interventions to reduce_
violence against women and girls found insufficient
evidence to advocate for empowerment interventions
similar to COMPASS in high-income countries; however,
the review found these strategies to be promising in
low-income and middle-income countries.[31] Our findings
suggest that additional investigation is needed to explore
the evidence for these strategies in humanitarian settings.
Further research into the moderating and mediating role
of prior exposure to outcome variables at baseline may illuminate mixed results on programme impact for girls with
different vulnerabilities. Additionally, future analyses may
consider factors associated with positive outcomes, such
as improvements in social support, to discern associations
between prior exposure to violence and feelings of social
support after programme participation. Finally, previous
research posits that a range of safety and coping strategies
may support girls’ adaptive resilience in settings where
violence remains a salient threat.[30] More realistic targets,
given the theory of change, might have included reducing
the frequency of violence victimisation or addressing girls’
resilience in the face of violence, rather than primary
prevention outright.
Despite the lack of evidence supporting the intervention’s
impact on violence outcome for girls, the programme’s
effects on other aspects of well-being and the high rates
of programme adherence demonstrate the potential for
implementing similar programme in humanitarian settings.
Although there were few competing activities providing
support for adolescent girls in the refugee camps, diligent
outreach activities by programme staff contributed to nearly
all girl and caregiver participants attending at least 75%
of programme sessions. Additionally, future programme
in these settings might consider adopting COMPASS’
strategic approach to programme scheduling in order to
maximise participation. For example, in the study setting,
school sessions are divided, with approximately half of girls
attending school in the morning and half attending in the
afternoon; COMPASS staff worked with women and girls to
ensure programme sessions and safe spaces were accessible
at convenient times.
This study has a few limitations worth noting. First, all
outcomes are self-reported and thus subject to disclosure
bias. For example, we observe inconsistencies in reports of
_ever having had consensual or non-consensual sex between_
baseline and endline. However, these inconsistencies
were not associated with treatment status and thus we do
not believe they biased estimates of programme impacts.
Contextual insights provided by COMPASS programme
staff suggest presence of maturity bias, as willingness to
share intimate details decreases as girls age in this setting.


While we acknowledge potential bias in reporting on the
study’s outcomes, we believe utilisation of ACASI, which
has been shown to increase the disclosure of responses to
questions on sexual behaviours and violence, helped to
minimise such biases.[41 42] Second, as mentioned above, realities in the field associated with implementing an RCT in a
humanitarian setting led to programme delays, resulting
in overlap between the reference period for the primary
outcome and the period of intervention delivery. A longer
follow-up period may more clearly illuminate any changes
in violence reduction. Third, although we measure severity
of sexual violence by assessing various types of violence
from sexual touching to forced sex, a measure of frequency
would have been useful in evaluating the programme’s
impact in line with the theory of change. Finally, while
groups were randomised in separate geographic zones
of three camps, we cannot completely rule out potential
spillover or contamination between treatment and control
girls. Such contamination may partially explain the overall
decline in self-reported past-year sexual violence in the full
sample, and, if contamination did produce these reductions, it may have masked the overall effectiveness of the
intervention. Despite these limitations, this study demonstrates that programming and rigorous research can
successfully be conducted with adolescent girls in a refugee
setting, particularly given the limited attrition rate, and
contributes to the limited evidence base for adolescent girls
in humanitarian settings.

**Conclusion**
To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the impact
of a life skills and safe spaces intervention for adolescent
girls in a refugee setting, where physical, sexual, and
emotional violence, transactional sex and child marriage
are salient threats to well-being. Experiencing these events
during adolescence disrupts physical and mental development and contributes to long-term health problems, and
intervention at this stage in the life course remains critical.[8 11] Findings suggest life skills programming can influence secondary outcomes that promote healthy transitions
to adulthood, while further research and programmatic
adaptations may be needed to fully realise changes in risk
of violence.
