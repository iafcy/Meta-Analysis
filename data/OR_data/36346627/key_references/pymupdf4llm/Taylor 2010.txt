Abstract In this study, we randomly assigned 123 sixth and seventh grade
classrooms from seven middle schools in the greater Cleveland area to one of two
five-session curricula addressing gender violence/sexual harassment (GV/SH) or to a
no-treatment control group. A baseline survey and two follow-up surveys were
administered immediately after the treatment (Wave 2) and about six months posttreatment (Wave 3). In an earlier paper, we demonstrated the effectiveness of two
approaches to youth GV/SH prevention programming (a fact-based, law and justice
curriculum and an interaction-based curriculum). In this paper, we explored whether
these largely positive findings remain for both girls and boys, including whether
girls experience higher levels of GV/SH than boys. Most of our statistical models
proved to be non-statistically significant. However, in 2 of our 48 victimization/
perpetration (any violence, sexual violence and non-sexual violence) models (across
two post-intervention follow-up points), we observed that the interventions reduced
peer (male or female, non-dating partner) sexual violence victimization and reduced
peer perpetration, but another outcome model indicated that the interventions
increased dating perpetration. These mixed findings will need to be explored further
in future research. Regarding our primary research question, we observed no

statistically significant differences for the treatment multiplied by gender interaction
terms for any of the perpetration or victimization outcome models, suggesting that
the treatment had similar effects on girls and boys. However, we did observe that
boys are more involved in violence than girls: both as victims and perpetrators. Boys
experienced significantly more of three types of victimization from peers and dating
partners compared to what girls experienced at the hands of their peers and dating
partners. As perpetrators, boys committed more sexual victimization against peers
(immediately post-intervention only) and more sexual victimization against dating
partners than girls. The implications of these results are discussed.

Introduction

Teen dating[1] violence is no longer a problem only recognized by sexual assault
and domestic violence centers, as it was nearly 30 years ago. Now it is
acknowledged as a major problem; its frequency is surveyed, suggesting that it
is experienced by as many as 40–60% of teenagers (Foshee et al. 1996; Hickman
et al. 2004; Jouriles et al. 2009); and interventions have been created to reduce its
severity or prevent its inception by a coalition of stakeholders, including policy
makers, criminologists, educators, psychologists, and medical personnel (Mulford
and Giordano 2008). School-based programs to prevent and reduce the precursors
to teen dating violence have become one of the most popular modes of
intervention to disrupt the normalcy of teen dating violence.
In our research project funded by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) in seven
middle schools in the greater Cleveland area, students in 123 sixth and seventh grade
classrooms were randomly assigned to one of two five-session curricula addressing
gender violence/sexual harassment (GV/SH) or to a no-treatment control. Threestudent surveys were administered over a six-month period. In an earlier paper
(Taylor et al. 2010), students in one of the treatments (law and justice), compared to
the control group, had significantly improved outcomes in awareness of their
abusive behaviors, attitudes toward GV/SH and personal space, and knowledge.
Students in the second treatment (Interaction-focused) experienced lower rates of
victimization, increased awareness of abusive behaviors, and improved attitudes
towards personal space. Neither curricula affected perpetration or victimization of
sexual harassment. While the interventions appeared to reduce peer violence
victimization and perpetration, a conflicting finding emerged: the intervention may
have increased dating violence perpetration (or at least the reporting of it) but not
dating violence victimization. In this article, we will explore whether these effects of
our interventions vary for boys compared to girls.

1 We defined “dating” in the following manner: “girls or boys you are going with, dating, going steady
with, or have gone out with, dated, or gone steady with for at least one week. This group includes anyone
who is or was your boyfriend/girlfriend for at least one week.”

Research questions

Our primary research question relates to whether there is a difference in the effects of
the interventions by gender. That is, do the interventions help girls more than boys or
vice versa? This is an important question to address for there is a considerable
amount of evidence that girls have different rates of victimization and perpetration
than boys and experience violence differently (see “Literature review”). Given these
findings, it is critical for researchers to assess if universal primary prevention
interventions (like the interventions we tested) are able to help both girls and boys. If
there are differential effects, future research can assess whether changes are needed
in the interventions. This leads to our second question about whether there are
differences in the levels of violence experienced by girls compared to boys (as
victims or perpetrators). Our third question is whether our earlier reported findings
regarding the effects of our two treatment groups (Taylor et al. 2010) remain the
same when controlling for possible gender effects. Our paper is one of the few to
examine gender difference in terms of the effects of prevention programming. We
focus on the issue of gender because it has often not received due attention in
attempts to address dating violence and is a central feature of dating violence (Lesko
2000; Stein 1995).[2]

Literature review

Prevalence of teen gender violence and sexual harassment (GV/SH)

GV/SH among teenagers has serious health consequences, including significantly
poorer mental and physical health, and more trauma symptoms (Howard et al.
2007a, 2007b; Molidor and Tolman 1998). Prevalence rates vary, but research on
teen dating violence suggests that as many as 40–60% of teenagers experience
dating violence, including sexual, physical, and psychological abuse (Foshee et al.
1996; Hickman et al. 2004; Jouriles et al. 2009).
The most consistent, standardized source for examining differences in rates of
sexual and physical teen dating violence for girls compared to boys can be found
in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), a comprehensive nationally
representative survey about youth behaviors administered by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in conjunction with state departments of public
health. Unfortunately, the administration of this survey is limited to students in
grades 9–12, with some states or locales recently gathering data from eighth
graders. Nonetheless, the national results from 2007 YRBS showed that for the

2 While there are other potential demographic variables to examine (e.g., ethnicity), we focus on the topic
of gender differences. Gender and the greater physical strength of males over females is a key aspect of
dating violence (Stein 1995) and can be used by boys to control young girls. We believe the topic of
gender is too complex to present with other demographic variables and would interfere with our goal of a
parsimonious presentation. Given our use of a RCT design, we found that we have a balance across our
treatment/control groups on the issue of ethnicity and other demographic variables. Given this balance, we
are able to assess the independent effects of gender without simultaneously examining other demographic
variables.

question “hit, slapped or physically hurt on purpose by their boyfriend or
girlfriend during the last 12 months” the frequency was 8.8% for girls and 11.0%
for boys (victimization), and for the second of the two questions on TDV, “ever
physically forced to have sexual intercourse in the past 12 months,” frequency
was 11.3% of the girls, and 4.5% of the boys (however, this question does not

[HealthyYouth/yrbs/pdf/yrbs07_us_disparity_sex.pdf). Results from Ohio (the state](http://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/yrbs/pdf/yrbs07_us_disparity_sex.pdf)
of our research project) for the same questions in 2007 (whether your boyfriend or
girlfriend hit, slapped or physically hurt you on purpose during the past 12 months)
revealed a rate of 9.8% for males, and 9.7% for females; and for the question,
“Have you ever been physically forced to have sexual intercourse when you did
[not want to” was 7.2% for the males and 13.0% for the females (see www.odh.](http://www.odh.ohio.gov/odhPrograms/chss/ad_hlth/YouthRsk/youthrsk1.aspx)
[ohio.gov/odhPrograms/chss/ad_hlth/YouthRsk/youthrsk1.aspx).](http://www.odh.ohio.gov/odhPrograms/chss/ad_hlth/YouthRsk/youthrsk1.aspx)
One dimension of teen dating violence that is not captured by the YRBS is the
factor of fear of being hit by one’s partner, and the injury that might occur. Girls are
more likely than boys to report more fear related to GV/SH (Foshee 1996; O’Keefe
and Treister 1998; Molidor et al. 2000). By the same token, girls are more likely to
be injured by their male dating partner than boys are likely to be injured by their
female dating partner (Bennett and Fineran 1998; Sugarman and Hotaling 1989;
Wolfe et al. 2009).
It is also useful to look at data about peer sexual harassment which is more
ubiquitous and widespread than dating violence. Victims of sexual harassment, in
addition to suffering from poorer mental and physical health, also exhibit greater
school avoidance than those not sexually harassed (Fineran and Gruber 2004;
Gruber and Fineran 2008; Larkin 1994). In comparison with boys who reported
harassment, studies have found that girls fare consistently worse on such measures
(Fineran and Gruber 2004; Gruber and Fineran 2008; AAUW 1993, 2001). Data
from the most recent national study of 2,064 students in grades 8–11 indicate that
83% of females experience sexual harassment from their male peers while male
students also reveal high levels of sexual harassment in school (60–79%) (AAUW
2001). Interestingly, the male students charge their male counterparts with
perpetrating the majority of verbal harassment (AAUW 1993, 2001; Tolman et al.
2003). Findings from the females suggest that the onset of their sexual harassment
began in grade 6. Prevalence rates for sexual harassment suggest that it increases
throughout middle school, indicating a need for early intervention (McMaster et al.
2002; Pellegrini 2001).
While girls and boys both experience high rates of GV/SH, they experience, think
of, and react to GV/SH differently (O’Keefe and Treister 1998; Gruber and Fineran
2008). First, girls are more likely than boys to be sexually victimized (Foshee 1996;
Molidor et al. 2000; Wolitzky-Taylor et al. 2008), and sustain more relationship
violence-related injuries than their male counterparts (Howard et al. 2007a, 2007b;
Jackson et al. 2000; Makepeace 1987; Molidor and Tolman 1998; O’Keefe 1997).
These studies have also revealed that, while males and females both perpetrate GV/
SH at high levels, the motivations (O’Keefe 1997; Mulford and Giordano 2008),
attitudes (Jackson et al. 2000; LeJeune and Follette 1994) and consequences
(Molidor and Tolman 1998; Wolitzky-Taylor et al. 2008) are often very different,
with girls faring consistently worse on a number of physical (Foshee 1996; Malik

et al. 1997; O’Keefe 1997; Watson et al. 2001; Fineran and Gruber 2004; Gruber and
Fineran 2008; AAUW 1993, 2001) and emotional outcomes (Foshee 1996; O’Keefe
and Treister 1998; Molidor et al. 2000). Teenage girls are more often killed by male
dating partners (or ex-partners) than the reverse (Sousa 1999); data from the
American Bar Association between 1993 and 1999 found that 22% of all homicides
against females aged 16–19 were committed by an intimate partner (Blow 2009).
Moreover, sexual risk behaviors, pregnancy, and suicidality are also associated with
victimization in girls (Silverman et al. 2001; 2004).

Research on teen GV/SH prevention programs

Prevention efforts in most school districts focus on violence in general terms (e.g.,
gangs, delinquency, drugs) but largely neglect the gendered nature of school
violence (Stein 1995). Studies on teen GV/SH have focused on students in the
eighth grade and higher (Foshee et al. 1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2007, 2008;
Jaycox et al. 2006[3]). While there have been numerous studies on risk factors for
GV/SH perpetration over the past 20 years (see Mulford and Giordano 2008), GV/
SH data on sixth and seventh grades are sparse, with few teen GV/SH interventions
having been evaluated rigorously (CDC 1998; Chalk and King 1998; Cornelius
and Resseguie 2006; Hickman et al. 2004; Meyer and Stein 2004; Taylor et al.
2010; Whitaker et al. 2006). Of these, most document at least a short-term positive
change in knowledge and/or attitudes related to gender violence (Foshee et al.
1996, 1998; 2000; Avery-Leaf et al. 1997; Lavoie et al. 1995; Macgowan 1997;
Jaffe et al. 1992; Wolfe et al. 2009), while others show longer-term positive
program effects (Foshee et al. 2004a, b, 2005; Foshee and Reyes 2009).
In one of the more rigorously evaluated interventions, Wolfe et al.(2009)
experimentally examined the 4R: Skills for Youth Relationships program with
Canadian ninth graders. They found that after 21 sessions the program was able to
reduce physical dating violence in the intervention group as compared to the control
group. Safe Dates, a U.S.-based program for eighth and ninth graders designed and
evaluated by Foshee et al. (1996, 1998, 2000, 2005), has also experimentally shown
a reduction in long-term physical dating violence after only 10 sessions. Evidence of
GV/SH in the eighth grade suggests that students in younger grades, specifically
sixth and seventh grades, are important points of primary prevention before dating
patterns have been set (Lonsway 1996; Mulford and Giordano 2008).
In Foshee & Matthew’s (2007) review of GV/SH program evaluations, gender
differences from some high quality experimental studies were summarized. In one of
those studies, black male junior high students with high academic abilities showed
the greatest and most significant gains (Macgowan 1997; Kraizer and Larson 1993).
In the evaluation of Safe Dates, the researchers (Foshee and Langwick 2004) found
that the program was equally effective in prevention perpetration for males and
females and for white and minority adolescents (Foshee and Matthew 2007). Wolfe’s
cluster randomized trial of 21 sessions conducted in health classes for ninth graders
in 20 Canadian schools (1,722 students aged 14–15) on the topics of healthy

included three intervention sessions and was taught by lawyers.

relationships, sexual health and substance use showed promising results, especially
for boys (Wolfe et al. 2009). Physical dating violence (PDV) was lower in the
intervention compared to the control group (9.8% vs 7.4%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.42;
p = .05), and a significant group-to-sex interaction effect indicated that the
intervention effect was greater in boys (PDV: 7.1% in controls vs 2.7% in
intervention students) than in girls (12.1% vs 11.9%). However, the likelihood of
replication in the US might be minimal given the pressures of high stakes testing that
permeates U.S. schools and the corresponding constraints for implementing a 21session curriculum.
In an effort to curb the vast prevalence of GV/SH, as documented in the previous
section, we evaluated two substantively distinct curricula on GV/SH prevention. In a
prior analysis (Taylor et al. 2008, 2010), we found largely positive findings
regarding the effectiveness of our interventions in reducing GV/SH compared to a
control group. In this paper, we explore whether these largely positive findings
remain for both girls and boys or works better for one over the other, as suggested by
Wolfe et al. (2009). We had originally thought that girls would have experienced
more sexual violence and therefore would be more receptive to our interventions.
Moreover, we wondered if there were differences in the levels of violence
perpetrated or experienced by girls or by boys. In the sections that follow, we
describe our interventions and methods used in our study, followed by a review of
our data analytic results on gender differences and its possible interaction effects
with our interventions.

Description of the interventions

The two curricula were (1) an interaction-based curriculum and (2) a law and justice
curriculum. Also, a third set of classes served as the control condition that did not
receive either of the two curricula designed by our team. Instead, the control
condition received the standard health education offered by their respective school
districts, which did not include dating violence prevention material.
We developed the two treatments in close collaboration with the staff members
from the three participating school districts and a local rape crisis center. Both
curricula contained five lessons (designed to last 40 minutes each) and were taught
over about five consecutive weeks. The lessons were taught by an experienced
female educator from a local sexual assault center. This educator was the center’s
manager of education services, and had extensive experience teaching violence
prevention in schools. Since the lessons were written for middle school students, the
classroom pedagogy had to engage them and not rely on simply didactic lessons.
Although a longer program could have been developed, the project team decided to
develop lessons that could be implemented within the typical time constraints that
most schools faced.
Our lessons concentrated on the definitions and applications of “personal space”
and “boundaries”—notions that are synonymous with laws—distinguishing permissible behaviors from those that are not. From the obvious wall that serves as a
boundary of a room, to a border that delineates one state or nation from another, to a
more abstract use of boundaries employed in rule- and law-making, students have

various opportunities to apply these concepts in activities themed around precursors
to GV/SH. Both curricula began with the same lesson on the establishment of
relationship boundaries through an activity that measures “personal space.” The
distinctions between the two treatments (interaction-based, law and justice) were
reflected in the questions that followed the activity during the first lesson. The law
and justice curriculum prompted discussion about the consequences of not obeying
boundaries (e.g., rules, laws). The interaction-based treatment centered on the ways
in which one notices that boundaries have been crossed or violated, either in terms of
transmitting oneself or understanding the ways in which someone else might indicate
his or her boundaries had been crossed.
More broadly, the interaction-based curriculum addressed GV/SH by focusing on
setting and communicating boundaries in relationships; the formation of deliberate
relationships/friendships and the continuum between friendship and intimacy; the
determination of wanted/unwanted behaviors; and the role of the bystander as
intervener in GV/SH incidents. The law and justice curriculum focused on laws,
definitions, information, and data about penalties for sexual assault and sexual
harassment as well as imparting results from research about the consequences for
perpetrators of GV/SH. The law and justice intervention explored the concepts of
laws/boundaries, plotting the shifting nature of personal space, considering laws as
they apply by gender, and a final activity on myths and facts about sexual
harassment.
Very detailed instructions were included with each lesson. These instructions
covered items such as ground rules (e.g., “no swear words”) as well as the length of
time to devote to each activity within the class period. We carefully monitored the
curricula implementation. As pointed out by Durlak and Dupre (2008), an
assessment of implementation of an intervention is a critical aspect of a program
evaluation. Based on the student surveys, observations by our team, and tracking
logs maintained by the interventionist, the curricula were implemented as designed
and planned.[4]

The rationale for selecting these two curricula to test was based on the Theory of
Reasoned Action (TRA). TRA is based on research that demonstrates that intentions
to behave are immediate predecessors to specific actions, and proposes that attitudes
toward and perceived norms about the desired behavior facilitate the intention to
change, modify, or adopt a particular behavior (Ajzen and Fishbein 1980; Fishbein
1967). Our interaction-based curriculum was designed to address negative attitudes
and beliefs about dating violence, through interaction skill building, that in turn will
lead to behavioral change. However, the law and justice curriculum was designed to
change behavior more directly through a fact-based curriculum on the laws
pertaining to dating violence. Knowledge of these laws and penalties was then
expected to reduce violent behavior toward dating partners. Our use of TRA was
based on the explanatory power of this theory, as demonstrated in a variety of fields
for the past 30 years (Fores et al. 2002; O’Callaghan et al. 1997; McGahee et al.
2000; Budd et al. 1983; Conner et al. 1998; de Vroome et al. 2000).

partners are provided in the project final report (see Taylor et al. 2008).

Research methods

Study design

This experiment was conducted in 2006 and 2007 with students in sixth and seventh
grade classrooms from three suburban school districts in the Cleveland, Ohio area,
including: 80 science classes, 17 social studies classes, 12 health classes and 14
other classes. The 123 classrooms were drawn from three participating school
districts from Shaker Heights City School District, Berea City School District, and
Cleveland Heights-University Heights School District. All sixth and seventh grade
classrooms from these three school districts were selected and participated in the
random assignment process, and student survey process). We selected these school
districts because they had large numbers of sixth and seventh grade classes (n>100)
available for random assignment and the student body (n > 15,000) represented a
diversity of ethnic groups to study the interventions. In total, seven schools from
across these districts were included in the study (n=1,639 students across 123 study
classrooms).
With such a sample size, our study had a good degree of statistical power to find
small to medium effect sizes. According to Cohen (1988), effect sizes can be
classified in the following manner: Small effects =.25; medium effects =.75; large
effects=1.25. Using Optimal Design developed by Raudenbush and Liu (2000), it
was possible to calculate the statistical power of this HLM-based study (assuming an
alpha of .05, a two-sided test, and an intraclass correlation coefficient of .15). This
study had enough power to detect large, medium and small effect sizes, although the
power did not quite reach the .80 threshold for very small effect sizes (power just
below .7).[5]

While we had 1,639 students in the study, not all the participants completed
all of the questions on the study surveys across all the waves of the survey.
Nevertheless, we were able to achieve a fairly high participation rate. At Wave 1,
1,507 of 1,639 study eligible participants completed the survey (92%), at Wave
2, we retained an 89% participation rate (1,460 of the original 1,639), and at
Wave 3, we retained an 83% participation rate (1,356 of the original 1,639). As
displayed in Table 1, our attrition of students was relatively balanced across the
treatment and control groups. As reported in an earlier paper (Taylor et al. 2010),
we found no differences in the survey participation rates across the Control,
Interaction Treatment Group and Law and Justice Treatment Group for the three
survey waves.
We used a randomized control trial (RCT) design. RCTs are typically considered
the best method for eliminating threats to internal validity in evaluating social
policies and programs (Berk et al. 1985; Boruch et al. 1978; Campbell 1969;
Campbell and Stanley 1963; Dennis and Boruch 1989). RCTs provide a strong
counterfactual description of what would have happened to the treatment group if
they had not been exposed to the treatment (Rubin 1974; Holland 1986). Random

5 Due to resource constraints, our main interest was in detecting small to medium effect sizes, for anything
below that level (given the time and resources to implement the program) might possibly be considered
less meaningful for policy making purposes.

assignment was implemented at the classroom level,[6] and we worked carefully to
maintain the integrity of the assignment process (e.g., avoiding contamination). We
established procedures to monitor and maintain the integrity of the classroom
assignment process (and monitor for expectancy, novelty, disruption, and local
history events).
We used a stratified random allocation procedure (see Boruch 1997). Classes were
classified by two relevant stratifying criteria (grade level and school).[7] Also, given
that our main question was whether treatment was more effective than no treatment,
we randomly assigned about half of our classes (54%) to the control condition and
the other half to receive an intervention (either the interaction-based or law and
justice-based curriculum). Twenty-three percent of the classrooms (n=29) were
assigned to treatment 1 (an interaction-based curriculum) conducted over a fiveweek period. Twenty-three percent of the classrooms (n=29) were assigned to
treatment 2 (a law and justice-based curriculum) also conducted over a five-week
period. Fifty-four percent of the classrooms (n=65) were assigned to the control
condition.
All classes assigned to treatment received their appropriate treatment, and the
same held true for the control group (i.e., our study had no “overrides” or cases that
did not follow the random assignment protocol). Also, as reported in Taylor et al.
(2008), our RCT design produced largely equivalent treatment and control groups
prior to the delivery of the intervention. That is, we found no pre-treatment
differences between the Control, Interaction Treatment Group, and Law and Justice
Treatment Group for a whole series of baseline variables [demographics (including
gender), history of victimization or perpetration, experience with prevention
programs, and history of dating] (Taylor et al. 2008).

6 Logistically, it would not have been possible to take students out of their regular schedule and randomly
assign them on an individual basis to new classes. Also, the funding necessary to assign a large number of
schools (e.g., over 50 schools) randomly to our study conditions was not available.

7 Although not strictly necessary, pre-stratification helps ensure that groups start out with some identical
characteristics and assure that we have adequate numbers of classrooms in each of the cells for each
participating school (see Boruch 1997).

Measures

Student surveys were completed using paper and pencil, and were distributed by a
member of the research team: (1) immediately before the assignment to one of the
three study conditions, (2) immediately following after the treatment or control
condition were completed, and (3) five to six months[8] after their assignment to one
of the three study conditions. To participate in the survey, we required the active
written consent of the parents’ of the students, along with the verbal assent of the
students. There were no apparent differences in the survey participation rates across
the three comparison groups for the three survey waves. That is, all the groups
participated (both parents consented and child assented to completing a survey) at a
rate of about 75% for the baseline survey and 70% for the first and second follow-up
surveys. Below is a brief description of our survey measures. In Taylor et al. (2008),
we include a copy of the survey, and present a more detailed review of these
measures, along with reliability scores.

Sexual and non-sexual (physical) violence victimization and perpetration

The survey included prevalence (yes/no) and incidence (number of times) questions
on the experience of being a victim and/or perpetrator of sexual violence and nonsexual (physical) violence by/of peers,[9] and people that you have dated.[10] While the
intervention was focused on reducing violence among dating partners, we examine
this issue to assess if the intervention’s effect might extend to peers, as well as dating
partners. The items for this survey were adapted from CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior
Survey and from a study by Foshee et al. (1998). Physical violence items included:
slapping or scratching; physically twisting an arm or bending back fingers; pushing,
grabbing, shoving, or kicking somewhere on the body other than in the private parts;
hitting with a fist or with something hard besides a fist; and threatening with a knife
or gun. Sexual violence items included: pushing, grabbing, shoving, or kicking in
the private parts; and making you touch their private parts or touching yours when
you did not want them to. All of the victimization measures have Cronbach’s alpha
scores above .71, except for the frequency measure of dating victimization in Wave
2 which had a score of .60. All the violent perpetration measures have Cronbach’s
alpha scores above .70.

Analysis plan

In order to address any missing data from partially completed questionnaires, we
used multiple imputations in our analyses (Fichman and Cummings 2003). First, we

8 School scheduling precluded us from doing all of the surveys at the six-month follow-up point in time.

9 This was defined for students as, “People about the same age as you. They may be your classmates, kids

might not know them or think of them as your friends.”

have ‘gone out with,’ ‘dated,’ or ‘gone steady with’ for at least a week. This group also includes anyone
who is or was your boyfriend/girlfriend for at least a week.”

created five multiply imputed datasets in SAS 9.1 using the PROC MI procedure.
Secondly, we analyzed our datasets in HLM 6.0, which supports multiple
imputations. To address all of our quantitative study aims we used HLM 6 software
developed by Raudenbush et al. (2004). HLM provides a conceptual framework and
a flexible set of analytic tools to analyze the special requirements of our data (i.e.,
students are nested within classes that are nested within schools). We estimated
numerous HLM models examining the effects of GV/SH classes on our outcomes
immediately after the GV/SH classes and at a six-month follow up. We examined a
number of HLM models for the experience of being a victim and/or perpetrator of
sexual violence and non-sexual (physical) violence from/to “peers” and “people that
you have dated.”

Results

The first part of this section presents the background characteristics of our sample,
including descriptive statistics on the distribution of our outcome measures. The
subsequent section presents the substantive results of our multivariate HLMs for
each of our outcome measures.

Descriptive statistics

The students in our study were from the sixth and seventh grades and were generally
between the ages of 11 to 13 years old. Our study is unique in our use of such a
young group to study GV/SH. That is, most GV/SH studies are done with students in
the ninth grade through twelfth grades of high school. Next, we had slightly more
girls (52%, n=831) in our sample than boys (48%, n=761).[11] Approximately a
quarter of our student sample were African American (27% or n=392), about half
were Caucasian (52% or n=750), 3% were Asian (n=43), 3% were Hispanic (n=
40), 2% Native American (n=32), and 13% multi-racial or other ethnicities (n=187).
About a quarter of our sample (23% or n=288) also had prior experience with a
violence prevention educational program. The majority of our sample (56% or n=
705) had been in a dating relationship at least once in their lifetime (where the dating
lasted longer than at least one week); about half of these students had either one or
two dating partners (75% had five or fewer dating partners). Our sample consisted of
a relatively large number of students who had already experienced dating violence in
their lifetime prior to our study (28% or n=445). Also, 21% (n=334) of our sample
reported in the baseline survey perpetrating at least one act of dating violence in their
lifetime.
To provide an overview of the distribution of our outcome measures, we
present descriptive statistics for each of our main outcome measures for boys and
girls in Table 2 for our baseline (Wave 1), time 2 point immediately after the

11 As discussed earlier, not all the respondents completed all of the questions on the survey. For example,
47 students did not answer the gender question on the survey.

violence, and non-sexual (physical) violence we calculated prevalence and
frequency scores. Prevalence was calculated by looking at the survey items in
each domain and scoring student responses as “yes” and “no” and then summing
these responses into a count of the number of times a student responded yes to
each domain.[12] For example, a value of 1.26 for peer victimization (the upper lefthand corner value) means that, on average, male students face 1.26 out of 7 types
of victimization in Wave 2 [for the same measure girls experienced just under 1
(.95) out of 7 types of victimization]. Also, on average, male students face .15
sexual victimizations from their peers out of 2 types of sexual victimization. On
average, students face 1.1 non-sexual victimizations from their peers out of the 5
types of non-sexual victimization. Frequency was calculated by looking at the
survey items in each domain and scoring student responses as the number of times
they were victimized/ perpetrated violence, which means that the frequencies must
always be higher than the prevalence measures.[13] For example, a score of 1.83
(second row, upper left-hand column) means that on average male students were
victimized more than 3 times (1=1–3 victimizations) in Wave 2 (the period during
the intervention).
Overall, peer victimization is generally reported at the highest level by students
followed by peer perpetration, dating victimization and dating perpetration. Based on
Table 2, it can be seen that boys are experiencing higher level of victimization than
girls for all categories across Waves 1, 2 and 3. also, boys are perpetrating more
violence than girls in most of the categories from Table 2 (except for Wave 1 under
dating perpetration and some of the categories under dating perpetration for Waves 2
and 3). Our tests of whether these differences are statistically significant are
conducted in the context of our HLM models (see next section) which are well
suited to address the nested nature of our data.

Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM)

The student, classroom and school-level variables used in the analyses were selected
from the student surveys and included a level 1 classroom variable of a baseline
score for each respective outcome variable selected (e.g., when sexual violence at
time 2 follow-up is the outcome variable than we included a baseline measure of
sexual violence). Our level 2 student variables included: a variable noting the
treatment assignment (i.e., treatment 1, treatment 2 and control group), a gender
variable (0=male and 1=female), a gender × treatment interaction term, and a site

12 Prevalence of “any” violence was the sum of all student responses for one domain, with a possible score
of 7 for survey items a through g. Prevalence of sexual violence was the sum of all student responses for
sexual violence, with a possible score of 2 for items d and f. Prevalence of non-sexual (physical) violence
was the sum of all student responses for one domain, with a possible score of 5 for items a, b, c, e, and g.
Each outcome measure represents a sum of the different types of violence individuals face/perpetrate.

13 If a student scored “0”, they had 0 victimizations; 1=1-– victimizations; 2=4-– victimizations; 3=10+
victimizations. Each frequency measure represents a sum of the number of times students face violence on
those measures.

variable (coded as 1 to 7 for each school building).[14] For each covariate introduced
at the classroom level, it is centered at the grand mean for that variable.[15]

We ran 48 HLM models and used an alpha level of .05 (with a two-tailed test).
Table 3 (see Appendix 1) presents our HLM models, including covariates for
gender,[16] treatment assignment[17] and gender × treatment. The tables include
estimated beta coefficients, standard errors for each fitted model (the numbers in
parentheses), and asterisks for p values that convey the level of statistical
significance of the beta coefficients (*< .05, **< .01).

Victimization outcomes

We explored personal victimizations perpetrated by the respondent’s (1) peers and
(2) individuals the respondent have dated. For each of these types of personal
victimizations, we explored an overall victimization measure, sexual victimization,
and non-sexual victimization. Within each of these three victimization measures, we
explored prevalence post-intervention, and incidence/frequency post-intervention.
Our victimization variable represents a sum of the seven types of victimization asked
in our survey; therefore, a positive score is indicative of a greater level of
victimization, while a negative number would indicate decreased levels.

Wave 2

During the intervention period (Wave 2 within the interaction-based treatment
model), we found that girls experienced less sexual victimization from peers than
boys experienced from peers [β= −.044 (.021), p = .038], less “any” victimization
from dates than boys experienced from dates [β=−.078 (.039), p =.046], and less
non-sexual victimization prevalence [β=−.073 (.033), p =.026] from dates than boys
experienced from dates and less non-sexual victimization frequency [β=−.109
(.054), p <.05] from dates than boys experienced from dates. Over the same period,
no statistically significant differences were observed for any of the treatment to
control comparisons, nor were significant differences observed for the treatment
multiplied by gender interaction terms for the victimization variables.

Wave 3

Six months after the intervention (Wave 3), we found that girls experienced fewer
incidents of “any” victimization from peers than boys [law and justice model β= −.439

which served as the reference category.
15 That is, for each school, the intercept of the level 1 model is adjusted for the linear regression of the test
scores on that variable. In a sense, that puts all school means on an equal footing with respect to that
variable. In the HLM setting, the adjusted intercepts can be described as “adjusted school means.” The
variation among adjusted means will usually be less than the variation among the unadjusted means (see
Raudenbush and Bryk, chapter 5 [2002]).

p = .017; law and justice model β=−.172 (.059), p = .004], fewer incidents of nonsexual victimization from peers than boys (law and justice model β=−.321 (.159),
p = .044], less “any” victimization prevalence from dates than boys [interaction-based
treatment model β=−.131 (.053), p = .013; law and justice model β=−.106 (.052),

(.110), p = .007], fewer incidents of sexual victimization from dates than boys [law and
justice model β=−.074 (.037), p = .046], less non-sexual victimization prevalence from
dates than boys [interaction-based treatment model β=−.119 (.040), p = .003; law and
justice model β=−.096 (.040), p = .018], and fewer incidents of non-sexual
victimization from dates than boys [law and justice model β=−.241 (.082), p = .004].
Over the same period, significant differences were observed for the
interaction-based treatment compared to the control group for the prevalence

[β=−.071 (.035), p = .048] and frequency [β=−.144 (.065), p = .030] of peer
sexual violence victimization (indicating less sexual violence victimization for
those in the interaction-based treatment compared to the control group). However,
no significant differences were observed for the treatment multiplied by gender
interaction terms for the victimization variables.

Perpetrating violence outcomes.

We also explored violence perpetrated by respondents against their (1) peers and (2)
people the respondent dated, including an overall violence perpetration measure, a
sexual violence perpetration measure, and a non-sexual (physical) violence nonsexual (physical) violence perpetration measure.

Wave 2

Over this period, while no statistically significant variables were observed for the
peer perpetration dependent variable, a number of significant variables emerged for
the dating perpetration dependent variable. During the intervention period (Wave 2
within the interaction-based treatment model), we found that girls perpetrated less
sexual dating victimization (prevalence) than boys [β=−.022 (.009), p = .015], and
girls perpetrated fewer incidents of sexual dating victimization than boys (frequency)

[β=−.037 (.016), p = .022].
Over the same period, statistically significant differences were observed for the
interaction-based treatment [β = .071 (.030), p = .020] compared to the control group,
and the law and justice treatment [β = .064 (.032), p = .048] compared to the control
group for the prevalence of “any” violence against dating partners (suggesting that the
interventions increased the perpetration of dating violence). Also of concern is that
interaction-based treatment was associated with higher levels of the prevalence of
perpetrating dating sexual violence [β = .20 (.010), p = .039]. Of note, no significant
differences were observed for the treatment multiplied by gender interaction terms for
the perpetration variables (indicating the treatment affected the girls and boys similarly).


-----

Wave 3

Six months after the intervention (Wave 3 within the law and justice treatment
model), we found that girls perpetrated fewer incidents (frequency) of sexual
peer victimization than boys [β = −.081 (.036), p = .024], and that girls
perpetrated fewer incidents (frequency) of sexual dating victimization than boys

[β =−.079 (.029), p = .007].
Over the same period, statistically significant differences were observed for the
law and justice treatment [β=−.156 (.076), p = .043] compared to the control group
for the prevalence of “any” peer violence (suggesting that the interventions
decreased the perpetration of peer violence). Similarly, the law and justice treatment
was associated with lower levels of the prevalence of perpetrating peer non-sexual
(physical) violence [β=−.153 (.071), p = .034]. However, statistically significant
differences were observed for the law and justice treatment [β = .187 (.087),
p = .036] compared to the control group for the frequency of perpetrating “any”
dating violence and the frequency of perpetrating dating sexual violence [β = .072
(.032), p = .025]. These last two findings suggest that the interventions increased the
perpetration of dating violence and dating sexual violence. Of note, no significant
differences were observed for the treatment multiplied by gender interaction terms
for the perpetration variables in Wave 3 (indicating the treatment affected the girls
and boys similarly).

Discussion

In an earlier paper (see Taylor et al. 2010), we demonstrated the effectiveness of
two approaches to youth GV/SH prevention programming. While most research on
this topic has been on programs that target older middle/high school students, to
serve as a primary prevention effort, we geared our intervention towards studying
sixth and seventh grade students and found largely positive findings on
effectiveness. In this paper, we explored whether these largely positive findings
remain for both girls and boys, including whether girls experience higher levels of
peer or dating violence than boys. Based on our analyses presented in this paper,
the introduction of a gender variable substantively altered one of our original
findings regarding whether our interventions reduced the perpetration of some
forms of peer violence. Also, we found differences in levels of victimization and
perpetration of peer and dating violence for boys compared to girls. Below we
summarize our findings on whether treatment was more effective while controlling
for gender effects, whether our treatment multiplied by gender interaction was
statistically significant, and overall differences in rates of violence and perpetration
for girls compared to boys.

Victimization

As reported in our earlier paper (see Taylor et al. 2010), we also found that six
months after the intervention (Wave 3), statistically lower rates for the prevalence
and frequency of peer sexual violence victimization for the interaction-based

treatment. That is, we confirmed our earlier finding of less peer sexual violence
victimization for those in the interaction-based treatment (but not law and justicebased treatment) compared to the control group even when controlling for the
variable of gender, and gender multiplied by treatment interaction term. Regarding
our primary research question, we observed no statistically significant differences for
the treatment multiplied by gender interaction terms for any of the victimization
variables in Waves 2 or 3. Our results suggest that treatment was equally as effective
for girls and boys on this measure.[18] This positive finding is encouraging in our
efforts to reduce violence for all students, for our analyses identified that during the
intervention period (Wave 2 within the interaction-based treatment model) boys
experienced more sexual victimization from peers than girls experienced from
peers,[19] and more “any” victimization and non-sexual victimization from dates than
girls experienced from dates. Also, six months after the intervention (Wave 3), boys
were still experiencing more sexual victimization from peers than girls were
experiencing from peers, but were also now experiencing more “any” victimization
and non-sexual victimization from peers than girls. In terms of violence by dating
partners, six months after the intervention, boys were still experiencing more “any”
victimization and non-sexual victimization from dates than girls, but were also now
experiencing more sexual victimization from dates than girls.[20]

Perpetration

As reported in our earlier paper (see Taylor et al. 2010), we also found that during
the intervention period (Wave 2) statistically higher levels of prevalence of “any”
violence against a dating partner for both treatments compared to the control group,
and that the interaction-based treatment was associated with higher levels of the
prevalence of perpetrating sexual violence with dating partners (also at Wave 2).
Along the same lines, we found statistically higher levels of the frequency of
perpetrating “any” dating violence and sexual violence against dating partners six
months after the intervention for the law and justice treatment compared to the
control group. These findings suggest that the interventions increased the
perpetration of “any” dating violence and dating sexual violence. However, when
we introduce a gender variable and a treatment multiplied by gender interaction term
we now have an encouraging finding on our perpetration of peer violence measures.
That is, six months after the intervention, statistically significant reductions were
observed for the law and justice treatment compared to the control group for the
prevalence of perpetrating “any” peer violence and peer non-sexual violence.
Suggesting that the interventions decreased the perpetration of peer “any” violence
and non-sexual violence. Below, we discuss the implications of our finding that

18 Conversely, our findings also demonstrate our interventions to be equally as ineffective on all of our
other non-significant victimization outcome measures.
19 As stated in the measures section, our definition of sexual violence includes a range of very serious
forms of sexual assault plus behaviors such as “butt grabbing.”

20 Students were asked the following two questions regarding sexual violence: “Have any of your PEERS
ever done any of the following things to you? Pushed, grabbed, shoved, or kicked you in your private
parts? Made you touch their private parts or touched yours when you did not want them to?

dating violence perpetration increased with treatment but that peer violence
perpetration decreased with one of the treatments.
Regarding our primary research question, we observed no statistically significant
differences for the treatment multiplied by gender interaction terms for any of the
perpetration outcome variables in Waves 2 or 3. Our results suggest that the
treatment had similar effects on the girls and boys on all of our perpetration
measures. Despite this finding, we did observe that during the intervention period
(Wave 2 within the interaction-based treatment model), that boys perpetrated more
sexual dating victimization (prevalence and frequency) than girls. Six months after
the intervention (within the law and justice treatment model), we found that boys
also perpetrated more incidents (frequency) of sexual victimization against peers and
dating partners than girls.

Implications of treatment findings

Both interventions were designed to prevent GV/SH. Two of our measures indicate
that at least one of the interventions reduced peer sexual violence victimization or
reduced peer perpetration. However, another measure indicated that dating
perpetration increased. One possible explanation for the iatrogenic finding regarding
dating violence perpetration is that as students were exposed to these lessons, they
may have reflected on past behaviors associated with dating that had previously
seemed normal, and now after the treatment, they viewed as acts of violence.
However, the control group did not have any exposure to the interventions and likely
continued to fail to identify their dating behavior as GV/SH. In the context of dating,
students in the control group not exposed to the lessons might still have a hard time
recognizing their behavior with dating partners as GV/SH, perhaps even believing
that GV/SH is a normal part of a relationship. However, in the area of peer
victimization or peer perpetration, the control group has fewer problems recognizing
their behavior as GV/SH—leading to the result that one of the treatment groups has a
lower rate of peer victimization and a lower rate of peer perpetration than the control
group. Under this rationale, the interventions might have affected the student’s
sensitivity to the problem of GV/SH, and it made it more likely for them to identify
and report certain dating behaviors as GV/SH. It is possible that this iatrogenic
finding (increase in dating violence perpetration) is due to reporting issues as
opposed to actual behavioral changes in GV/SH levels. The fact that there was not
also an increase in dating victimization supports the possibility that some students
might have exaggerated their reporting of violence or were more sensitized to
recognizing certain behaviors as GV/SH. That is, if perpetration increased, we would
likely have seen an increase in victimization (but we did not). Future research will
need to consider this type of reporting problem, and design measurement strategies
to disentangle these issues (e.g., build in questions distinguishing between actual
behavioral changes and perceptual changes about behavior).
The other possibility is that this is just an anomalous finding. With two
measures indicating that peer victimization and peer perpetration decreased for
one of the treatment groups, and only one measure suggesting an increase in
dating violence associated with treatment, the iatrogenic finding could be a
spurious result.

Implications of gender findings

Overall, we observed in our study data that boys are more involved in violence than
girls: both as victims and perpetrators. Boys experienced significantly more of all
three types of victimization from peers and dating partners compared to what girls
experienced at the hands of their peers and dating partners.[21] As perpetrators, boys
committed more sexual victimization against peers (Wave 2 only) and more sexual
victimization against dating partners (Waves 2 and 3) than girls did as perpetrators.
Our findings on perpetration are congruent with findings showing that boys are more
physically aggressive than girls (Dodge et al. 2006; Foshee and Matthew 2007;
Wolfe et al. 2009). Our finding of greater involvement of boys in violence compared
to girls is also consistent with the general criminological literature of males more
likely to be both the perpetrators and victims of violence than females.[22] Girls may
be more concerned with conformity and following school rules, and care more about
“not getting in trouble.” Girls that perpetrate violence may get more noticed,
especially when they act in sex role atypical or sexually deviant behavior (Stein
1995; Brown et al. 2003, 2007; Chesney-Lind 2005).
We were surprised to observe that boys were more likely to be victims of sexual
violence than girls. One possibility is that schools are more geared to combat sexual
violence against girls but largely ignore boys that are sexually victimized by either girls
or boys. Schools may be inadvertently sending the wrong measure to boys. Boy victims
are told to “walk it off.” Boy perpetration of violence may be dismissed as “boys being
boys.” Another possibility relates to a limitation in our study measures of sexual
violence. Our measure of sexual violence includes a range of very serious forms of
sexual assault but also behaviors such as pushing, grabbing, shoving, or kicking
someone in their private parts. These items are all in one of our survey questions and
cannot be disentangled. Therefore, it may be that boys are experiencing more behaviors
such as “butt grabbing” as opposed to rape. Future research will need to consider
including more detailed measures of sexual violence in the student surveys.[23]

Future developments

The many non-significant findings and both positive and iatrogenic findings
suggests that there is likely a need for further refinements in our interventions.

21 More specifically, boys experienced more sexual victimization, “any” victimization (Wave 3 only) and
non-sexual victimization (Wave 3 only) from peers, and more “any” victimization, non-sexual
victimization, and sexual victimization (Wave 3 only) from dating partners than girls.

22 Based on data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) from 1973 to 2006, males have
experienced higher rates of victimization for violence than females for all types of violent crime except
[rape/sexual assault (see http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/glance/vsx2.htm). Also, males perpetrate much more](http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/glance/vsx2.htm)
crime than females regardless of whether the data analyzed are arrest rates, victimization reports on
characteristics of offenders, or self-reports of criminal behavior (Heimer 2000).

23 However, this will be a real challenge. Based on our experience working in schools, districts are very
concerned about including sexual assault measures on surveys due to the potential negative feedback they
may receive from parents. Researchers may need to work with parent groups to explain the rationale for
these measures and carefully work through the wording of these items on surveys to get approval for more
detailed items.

Future research should further investigate the interaction-based versus law and
justice based curricula to provide further information as to which components are
most successful or deleterious in reducing GV/SH. It would also be important to
learn if booster sessions might be needed to enhance the intervention or if the
curricula need to be longer than five sessions. We might also consider expanding
the target of our intervention to saturate the whole middle school environment to
include the 8th grade, as well as the sixth and seventh grades. Along with some
changes to the intervention, future research will also need to consider if the
effects detected at up to six months post intervention hold up after a year or
more post intervention. Longer longitudinal research might help us sort through
our mixed findings (e.g., perhaps the positive findings will continue to be
measured but the iatrogenic findings may dissipate). Future researchers might
also consider adding a qualitative component involving detailed interviews with
students receiving the intervention to explore any possible iatrogenic effects. For
example, is the intervention leading to real negative results or just increasing the
reporting of it by those in the intervention?

Concluding comments

On balance, we believe we have mixed findings regarding the efficacy of our
interventions in reducing perpetration. First, we have many non-statistically
significant findings. As discussed earlier, with a sample of 1,639 students across
123 study classrooms, we had a good degree of statistical power to find small to
medium effect sizes. Therefore, our absence of statistically significant findings
could be a reflection of the modest effects on behavior that this type of
prevention programming can have, as opposed to a by-product of one of our
study features. Next, while two of our measures indicate that at least one of the
interventions reduced peer sexual violence victimization or reduced peer
perpetration, another measure indicated that dating perpetration increased. To
sort through these mixed findings, more experimental research is needed to
provide greater clarity to our findings in additional cities. However, some
modifications may be needed in the tested interventions, as discussed above, to
address the possibility of iatrogenic results. Also, additional study measures
should be incorporated to address the possibility of iatrogenic results and help
document why they may be emerging.
Nevertheless, there is some encouraging news based on our results. We now
have an emerging sense of the types of lessons and pedagogy that can be helpful
for students in sixth and seventh grades, under certain circumstances, in the area
of reducing student-to-student violence. We also observed that the treatment had
similar effects on girls and boys. There are positive implications to this finding,
given our corresponding results that boys are more involved in violence than
girls (both as victims and perpetrators). That is, we are now hopeful that building
on our research, school districts will be in a better position to adopt interventions
and then observe reductions in student-to-student violence with both boys and
girls.
