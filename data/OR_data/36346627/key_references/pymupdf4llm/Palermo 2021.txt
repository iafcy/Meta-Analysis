Objectives. To examine the impacts of a government-implemented cash plus program on violence


experiences and perpetration among Tanzanian adolescents.

Methods. We used data from a cluster randomized controlled trial (n 5 130 communities) conducted in


the Mbeya and Iringa regions of Tanzania to isolate impacts of the “plus” components of the cash plus

intervention. The panel sample comprised 904 adolescents aged 14 to 19 years living in households

receiving a government cash transfer. We estimated intent-to-treat impacts on violence experiences,


violence perpetration, and pathways of impact.

Results. The plus intervention reduced female participants’ experiences of sexual violence by 5


percentage points and male participants’ perpetration of physical violence by 6 percentage points. There

were no intervention impacts on emotional violence, physical violence, or help seeking. Examining


pathways, we found positive impacts on self-esteem and participation in livestock tending and, among

female participants, a positive impact on sexual debut delays and a negative effect on school


attendance.

Conclusions. By addressing poverty and multidimensional vulnerability, integrated social protection can


reduce violence.

Public Health Implications. There is high potential for scale-up and sustainability, and this program

reaches some of the most vulnerable and marginalized adolescents. (Am J Public Health. 2021;111(12):

baseline, whereby only adolescents who reported having had sexual intercourse were asked questions about sexual violence. In subsequent waves, all
youths in the violence module were asked questions about sexual violence, which may include other forced sexual acts.

### Conclusions


Ethics approval for the study was granted by the
National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR/
HQ/R.8a/Vol.IX/2784) and the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology. Informed assent
and parental consent were obtained for all
unmarried adolescents aged 14 to 17 years, and
written informed consent was obtained directly
for those aged 18 and 19 years and married adolescents aged 15 to 17 years. There were no married adolescents younger than 15 years, which
was the legal age of marriage in Tanzania for girls.
The study was retrospectively registered with
the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry as
PACTR201804003008116.

Multisectoral approaches are increas

VAC reduction at the population level.
