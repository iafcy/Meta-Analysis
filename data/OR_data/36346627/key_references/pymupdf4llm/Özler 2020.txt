_Background: We evaluated Girl Empower – an intervention that aimed to equip adolescent girls with the skills to_
make healthy, strategic life choices and to stay safe from sexual abuse using a cluster-randomized controlled trial
with three arms: control, Girl Empower (GE), and GEþ.
_Methods: GE delivered a life skills curriculum to girls aged 13–14 in Liberia, facilitated by local female mentors._
In the GE þ variation, a cash incentive payment was offered to caregivers for girls’ participation in the program.
We evaluated the impact of the program on seven pre-specified domains using standardized indices: sexual
violence, schooling, sexual and reproductive health (SRH), psychosocial wellbeing, gender attitudes, life skills,
and protective factors.
_Findings:_ Participation rates in the program were high in both GE and GEþ, with the average participant
attending 28 out of 32 sessions. At 24 months, the standardized effects of both GE and GEþ, compared to control,
on sexual violence, schooling, psychosocial wellbeing, and protective factors were small (β, � 0.11 standard
deviations [SD]) and not statistically significant at the 95% level of confidence. However, we found positive
standardized effects on Gender Attitudes (GE: β, 0.206 SD, p<0.05; GEþ: β, 0.228 SD, p<0.05), Life Skills (GE: β,
0.224 SD, p<0.05; GEþ: β, 0.289 SD, p<0.01), and SRH (GE: β, 0.244 SD, p<0.01; GEþ: β, 0.372 SD, p<0.01; Ftest for GE ¼ GEþ: p ¼ 0.075).
_Interpretation: Girl Empower led to sustained improvements in several important domains, including SRH, but did_
not reduce sexual violence among the target population.


Violence against women (VAW) and children (VAC) are global epi­
demics that have lifelong impacts on the health and welfare of in­
dividuals, families, and communities. The epidemics are closely linked;
VAW and VAC tend co-occur within households and exposure to VAC
predicts female experience and male perpetration of intimate partner
violence (IPV) during adulthood (Guedes, Bott, Garcia-Moreno, &
Colombini, 2016). Because of their age, however, adolescents may not
have access to supportive interventions, most of which are aimed at
supporting either married adult females or younger children; adolescent
girls may therefore not have access to violence prevention or response
services (Ellsberg et al., 2017; Bruce & Hallman, 2008). Liberia, the

setting for this study, has a history of armed conflict during which
women suffered greatly (Swiss et al., 1998; Dziewanski, 2012); high
levels of interpersonal and sexual violence (SV) continue to occur,
particularly in areas that saw high conflict events and fatalities during
the civil war (Kelly, Colantuoni, Robinson, & Decker, 2018).
Programs designed to work specifically with adolescent girls as a
unique subpopulation began to appear in the early 1990s in the HIV field
and early 2000s more generally (Bruce & Hallman, 2008; Gibbs,
Jacobson, & Kerr Wilson, 2017). Some of these (reviewed by (Bruce &
Hallman, 2008; Marcus, Gupta-Archer, Darcy, & Page, 2017)) have
shown favorable impacts on sexual health behaviors, HIV and other

sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and child marriage. Few, how­
ever, have focused specifically on SV experienced by adolescents,
particularly among those younger than 15 years of age, out-of-school,
married, displaced or who have experienced multiple forms of
violence (Gibbs et al., 2017; Yount, Krause, & Miedema, 2017).
Girl-focused interventions designed to reduce SV mainly attempt to
address the accepted drivers of female disadvantage and victimization:
poverty, low earning power, social isolation, and/or harmful gender
norms. Although different categorizations have been employed in recent
reviews (Lundgren & Amin, 2015; Marcus et al., 2017), such programs
tend to include one or more of the following components: (a) a cash
transfer, frequently conditioned on income status or a behavior; (b)
economic skills strengthening without a cash transfer (vocational skills,
financial education, savings, and/or microcredit); and (c) gender
transformative content, usually delivered to girls by a mentor in a safe
space, to guardians or community members, or occasionally to both girls
and adults.
Several cash (or in-kind) transfer schemes have assessed impacts on
adolescent sexual behaviors (Cluver et al., 2013, 2014; Handa et al.,
2015; Heinrich, HJ, & Samson, 2017; Minnis et al., 2014; Rosenberg,
Pettifor, Thirumurthy, Halpern, & Handa, 2014); and/or HIV, herpes
simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
(Baird, Garfein, McIntosh, & Ozler, 2012; Bjorkman Nyqvist, Corno, de
Walque, & Svensson, 2018; Duflo, Dupas, & Kremer, 2015; Kohler &
Thornton, 2012; Pettifor et al., 2016; Walque et al., 2012, 2017). While
the impacts on child marriage and teen pregnancy are promising,
especially in the short-term, only two studies found reductions in HIV or
STI risk (Baird et al., 2012; Bjorkman Nyqvist et al., 2018), and the one
with a longer term follow-up revealed that the impacts of unconditional
cash transfers on pregnancy, marriage, and HIV largely evaporated after
the transfers stopped (Baird, McIntosh, & Ozler, 2019[€] ). Cash transfer
programs have also been demonstrated to reduce IPV reported by adult
women (Buller et al., 2016, 2018; Gibbs et al., 2018; Haushofer, Ringdal,
Shapiro, & Wang, 2019; Heath, Hidrobo, & Roy, 2018; Hidrobo,
Peterman, & Heise, 2016; Roy, Hidrobo, Hoddinott, & Ahmed, 2019). To
date, there is only one evaluated cash transfer program that assessed
impacts on SV experienced by adolescent girls (Kilburn et al., 2018) and
it reduced physical IPV among South African high school girls aged
13–20 by reducing their likelihood of being in a sexual relationship, but
did not have an effect on forced sex by intimate partners. IPV, physical
or forced sex, by non-intimate partners (such as family, teachers,
neighbors) was not included in the outcome. A review of social safety net
(SSN) programs on childhood violence used a broader definition of
sexual violence (sexual exploitation and/or sexual abuse) and found that
SSNs had a statistically significant protective impact on 40% of SV in­
dicators measured (Peterman, Neijhoft, Cook, & Palermo, 2017).
Another stream of interventions for adolescent girls combines
financial education and gender transformative content. This combina­
tion was inspired by an earlier wave of programs, which suggested that
providing micro-loans alone might put adolescents at greater risk for
experiencing SV, although the evidence for this hypothesis is based on
studies that are either non-experimental or rely on small samples
(Austrian & Muthengi, 2014; Dunbar et al., 2010). Financial education
(as distinct from livelihoods training and/or micro-loans) combined
with gender-transformative interventions, such as girls’ clubs, have
demonstrated favorable impacts on sexual and reproductive health
(SRH) behaviors (Dunbar et al., 2014; Jewkes et al., 2014; Bandiera,
Buehren, Burgess, &amp; et al, forthcoming), and SV (Austrian &
Muthengi, 2014; Dunbar et al., 2014; Jewkes et al., 2014; Bandiera
et al., forthcoming), but most studies focus on older adolescents up to
age 24, most of whom are already in sexual relationships.
This study examines the potential of adding a cash transfer compo­
nent to a gender transformative mentoring intervention, which aimed to
reduce sexual abuse among females in early adolescence. Although this
approach is unlikely to shift entrenched norms and practices around
sexual violence, providing girls with additional knowledge and skills via


a safe spaces’ platform could increase their supportive social connec­
tions (local adult female mentors and same-age female friends), and
provide protection within myriad unsafe situations of their environ­
ment. Monthly parenting sessions for caregivers were intended to bolster
adult supportive attitudes toward their girls. The cash incentive for girls’
attendance was primarily intended to boost program impacts by
increasing participation, but also hypothesized to enable girls avoid
sexual violence by delaying entry into unsafe sexual relationships
(Temin, Amin, Ngo, & Psaki, 2018). The program was implemented by
the International Rescue Committee (IRC) in rural Liberia and was
aimed at girls, aged 13–14. The target age range was chosen based on
the high rates of sexual debut (57%), school dropout (43%), pregnancy
(10%), and marriage (10%) already experienced by females aged 15–17
in the study region, as reported by the Demographic and Health Surveys
in 2007 (Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services
(LISGIS) [Liberia], 2007).

**Methods**

_The Girl Empower intervention in Liberia_

_Girl Empower_ was implemented by the IRC in 56 communities in
Nimba County, Liberia from February to November 2016. It aimed to
equip adolescent girls with the skills and experiences necessary to make
healthy, strategic life choices and to stay safe from sexual abuse.
Compared with the national average, the rate of ever experiencing
sexual violence in the North Central region (where Nimba County is
situated) was somewhat but not markedly higher (20.2 vs. 17.6% of
adult women); young women aged 20-24 married 1.5 years younger
(18.2 vs. 19.7 years); and primary school net attendance ratio for girls
was lower (28.2 vs. 38.6) (Liberia Institute of Statistics and
Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) [Liberia], 2007).
_Girl Empower was implemented in two treatment variations, called_
“GE” and “GEþ”. Both GE and GE þ consisted of 1) Girl Empower life
skills curriculum, facilitated by local female mentors; 2) Caregiver dis­
cussion groups, facilitated by IRC staff; 3) Individual savings start-up for
the girls; and 4) Capacity building for local health and psychosocial
service providers. In the GE þ variation, the IRC added an incentive
payment to caregivers tied to girls’ participation in weekly sessions.

_Life skills curriculum (GE and GEþ)_
_Girl Empower centered on a mentorship program where 65 groups of_
five to 20 adolescent girls, aged 13–14, met weekly with local trained
female mentors, aged 20 to 35, for a total of 39 weeks. The meetings took
place in safe spaces located in, and designated by, the communities. Two
mentors were assigned to each group (130 mentors in total) to facilitate
32 weekly sessions based on a life skills curriculum, which covered:
Sense of self; Feelings and emotions; Social networks; Protection and
safety; Financial literacy; Reproductive Health; Leadership and
Empowerment; and Setting life goals. The groups met for an additional
seven weeks to prepare a community action event as well as the grad­
uation ceremonies, which brought girls from intervention communities
to three central locations. During the graduation ceremonies, the Girl
Empower participants demonstrated the knowledge they acquired dur­
ing the program and advocated for support for their safety and protec­
tion in their homes, schools, and community at large. The mentors and
adolescent girls invited key stakeholders including community leaders,
government officials and international partners to these events.

_Caregiver sessions (GE and GEþ)_
IRC staff facilitated eight monthly sessions with 759 parents and
caregivers of the program participants. These sessions aimed at famil­
iarizing the parents and caregivers with the curriculum content, support
them in reinforcing the skills that the girls learned, and encourage them
to support and protect girls in their communities. The IRC provided
information on the challenges faced by adolescent girls, led discussions


-----

and reflections on how girls and boys are raised by their caregivers,
including ways in which these practices may directly or indirectly cause
harm, as well as on positive and supportive parenting strategies when
interacting with their daughters.

_Individual savings start-up (GE and GEþ)_
All participating girls received cash to help start their own savings
account, along with a savings book and a cash box. Each girl received $2
per month for a total of $16 during the eight-month implementation
period. IRC Liberia contracted a local NGO to implement the cash
transfer scheme, which announced the day the monthly transfers would
be made in each treatment community ahead of time. The savings
payments were provided directly to the participating girls as cash in
envelopes. An IRC assessment found that program areas did not have
ready access to formal banking institutions or good network coverage
for mobile transfers. As the savings payments were not tied to atten­
dance, girls who were absent on payment day accumulated their pay­
ments and received them on the next payment day they attended. The
envelopes for the girls were not given to their caregivers.

_Participation incentive payment (GE þ only)_
In the GE þ variation, caregivers of program participants received of
a payment of $1.25 for each of the 32 regular sessions that the adoles­
cent girl attended, for a maximum of $40. Once the previous month’s
attendance was known and confirmed for each participant, IRC Liberia
staff relayed this information to the same local NGO in charge of the cash
transfer scheme, which prepared envelopes containing the right amount
of cash to be given to the caregivers. To avoid multiple trips to the same
treatment community, the participation incentive payments to the care­
_givers were made at the same meeting as the savings payments to the girls._
Absent caregivers could similarly accumulate their payments and
receive them at the next payment meeting they attended. The envelopes
for the caregivers were not given to the girls. The implied transfer
amount of $40 for a girl with perfect _Girl Empower_ attendance was
determined by IRC Liberia as an estimate of the (financial and oppor­
tunity) cost of attending school for one year, an impact they hoped Girl
_Empower would have. This amount of approximately $6/month consti­_
tutes more than 10% of per capita consumption in Liberia (World Bank,
2018), and likely more in the study area, because Nimba is a poorer than
average rural county in Liberia.
The IRC also trained 56 local health and psychosocial service pro­
viders in the treatment communities to provide quality services to sur­
vivors of gender-based violence.

_Study procedures_

We conducted a parallel cluster-randomized controlled trial with
three arms: control, GE, and GEþ (allocation ratio: 1:1:1). In order to
reach the estimated required sample size, we used data from the 2008
census of the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services
to develop a list of 100 villages likely to have at least five eligible girls
aged 13 or 14. 10,930 households were listed in these 100 villages be­
tween July and September 2015 and 16 villages were found to contain
fewer than five eligible girls and removed from the study sample. In the
remaining 84 villages, we surveyed 1,216 eligible girls and 1,132
caregivers. Ex ante power calculations to detect a 10-percentage point
(pp) reduction in sexual debut and a 5-pp reduction in child marriages
(from expected control means of 57% and 10%, respectively, using the
Liberia Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2013[42](Liberia
Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services [LISGIS] Liberia,
2014)) were used to determine sample size. The data source used for
power calculations did not include data on sexual violence, which is why
the power calculations were based on these secondary outcomes.
Stratified randomization at the village level was conducted to assign
villages to the three study arms, where six strata were formed using the
number of eligible girls and the mean level of school enrollment in each


village. Within each stratum, villages were assigned randomly to con­
trol, GE, or GE þ conditions. A dofile was written in Stata 13.1 to
conduct the random assignment, which was overseen by the lead author.
Fig. 1 (Study Flow) describes the allocation of villages to the study arms.
The IRC team conducted registration for _Girl Empower_ in the 56
treatment villages in late 2015, during which 375 (396) of the 402 (415)
study participants in GE (GEþ) communities were found, all of whom
consented to participate in the program. In nine of the 56 treatment
villages, where the number of girls registered exceeded 20 (the
maximum number of girls in a group deemed manageable for the
mentors by the IRC staff), two groups were created, for a total of 65
groups in 56 villages. The IRC also identified, vetted, and trained 130
female mentors. Two female mentors led each group. Only registered
participants were allowed to attend Girl Empower sessions.
Follow-up data collection started in August 2017 and continued
through February 2018 with an extensive tracking effort to minimize
loss-to-follow-up, which was low (Fig. 1). We interviewed 96.7 percent
of the study participants at follow-up. Similarly, of the 1,136 caregivers
interviewed at baseline, 1,082 (or 95.9 percent) were successfully
interviewed at follow-up.
Institutional Review Boards at the Population Council and the Uni­
versity of Liberia approved the study procedures. Informed assent/
consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment in the
study. The trial is registered at the American Economic Association’s
AEA RCT Registry (AEARCTR-0002717) and at ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT03756467).

_Measures_

We collected data in seven domains at baseline and the 24-month
follow-up: SV (primary outcome), schooling, SRH, psychosocial well­
being, gender attitudes, life skills, and protective factors (secondary
outcomes). Within each of these domains, trained female enumerators
fluent in all local languages administered multiple questions or scales to
the study participants using tablets. The questionnaires used to collect
the data are under Supporting Documents and Materials in the AEA trial
registry.
To guard against over-rejection of the null hypothesis due to multiple
inference, we construct a standardized index for each of the seven do­
mains listed above. We construct each index using a weighted average of
the standardized index components, where the weights are determined
by the inverse covariance matrix of the components (Casey, Glennerster,
& Miguel, 2012). The analysis plan describing the exact regression
methods to analyze program impacts, along with the details regarding
the definitions and construction of the primary and secondary outcome
indices, can be found in Pre-Analysis Plan for Girl Empower under Sup­
_plementary Materials, which is also included under the Analysis Plan_
section of the AEA RCT registry.

_Analysis_

We compared the baseline values of the seven indices plus age be­
tween the three study arms to assess balance at baseline (Appendix
Table 1). For each variable, we report the mean in the control group, the
differences in GE and GEþ with the control group, the p-value of the
difference, and the number of observations, using a linear regression
(OLS) model with standard errors clustered at the village level. We also
report a “Chi-Squared Test for the Joint Orthogonality of all eight
baseline covariates,” using a multinomial logit regression with treat­
ment status as the dependent variable and the baseline covariates as the
independent variables. To assess whether loss to follow-up rates and the
characteristics of those lost to follow-up were similar across study arms,
we used the following regression model:

_Yij ¼ α þ βXij þ γ[2]T_ [2]j [þ][ γ][3][T] _j[3]_ [þ][ δ][2][T] _j[2][X][ij][ þ][ δ][3][T]_ _j[3][X][ij][ þ][ Z][j][ þ][ ε][ij][;]_

the mean rate of lost to follow-up in the control group at the 24-month
follow-up and joint F-tests for baseline covariates and their interactions
with each treatment arm are reported in Appendix Table 2.
To assess program impacts on each domain (and its components), we
conducted intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis using linear regression of the
following form for outcomes measured at the 24-month follow-up:

_Yij ¼ α þ γ[2]T_ [2]j [þ][ γ][3][T] _j[3]_ [þ][ βX][ij][ þ][ ε][ij][;]

where Yij is an outcome variable for individual i in cluster j; T[2]j [and ][T][3]j
are binary indicators for cluster-level interventions GE and GEþ,
respectively; and Xijis a vector of baseline covariates consisting only of
the lagged dependent variable and age of the individual in years. This is
equivalent to the well-known Analysis of Covariance (or ANCOVA)
estimation with additional covariate adjustment for age – when the
baseline value of the dependent variable is available. The regressions
also absorb the strata used for random assignment. The standard errors
_εij, clustered at the village level, account for both the design effect of the_
cluster-level treatment and heteroskedasticity inherent in the regression
model. We report coefficient estimates and p values in tables reporting
impacts (Tables 1–7) and in the text when discussing specific impact
findings. In the text under the **Results** section, we also report false
discovery rate-adjusted _q_ values for each pairwise comparison of the
seven outcome indices between study arms (Appendix Table 4), which is
the smallest level of statistical significance at which the null hypothesis
is rejected – using the Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) (Benjamini &
Hochberg, 1995) procedure as described in Anderson. (Anderson, 2008)

**Results**

_Description of the participants_

The baseline characteristics of the study sample have been described
elsewhere (Hallman et al., 2016), so we provide only a brief description
here. The average age in the control group was 13.7 at baseline. Most
girls (85.03%) had been enrolled in school during the 2014/15 year,

**Table 2**
Impacts on schooling - 24-month follow-up.


before the Ebola outbreak. Overall, 20.7% of girls reported that they had
had sex and, of those, 71.4% reported that their first sexual encounter
was consensual. Over one-third (37.3%) reported ever experiencing
sexual violence: 7.8% had been physically forced to have sex, 8.4% had
been non-physically pressured (coerced/persuaded) to have sex, 24.7%
had had someone unsuccessfully attempt to have sex with them, and
28.9% had been touched in a sexual way. Less than 2% of the study
participants had ever been pregnant or married/cohabitated with a
partner. These characteristics were balanced between the control group
and the two treatment arms (Hallman et al., 2016).
Baseline balance, loss to follow-up, and participation in Girl
Empower.
The vector of baseline characteristics that includes age and the seven
outcome indices is very similar across the three study arms, with none of
the chi-squared tests for the joint orthogonality of all eight baseline
variables producing a p value less than 0.425 (Appendix Table 1). To
avoid having an ad hoc vector of background characteristics being
included in the baseline balance table, we pre-specified only lagged
values of the outcome indicators and age for inclusion, as the latter can
be prognostic of many of the outcome indicators, such as sexual debut,
pregnancy, and marriage during adolescence.
The rate of loss-to-follow-up was small at 4% in the control group
(Appendix Table 2). The attrition analysis utilizes a regression model
with an indicator for lost-to-follow-up as the dependent variable and the
two treatment indicators along with the baseline characteristics
included in Appendix Table 1, which are fully interacted with each
treatment indicator, as independent variables. The coefficient estimates
for GE and GEþ in column (1) show that the rate of loss to follow-up was
similar to the control group in either intervention arm. The joint F-tests
of interactions at the bottom of the table under column (2) indicate that
the baseline characteristics of those lost to follow-up were not different
between GE and GEþ.
Attendance in Girl Empower sessions was high in both GE and GEþ,
with the average number of sessions attended being 27.8 and 28.4,
respectively, out of a total of 32 sessions (Appendix Table 3). Caregivers
in the GE þ arm attended a higher number of monthly caregiver sessions
than those in GE (7.45 vs. 6.80; p value < 0.01).

having never had sex assumed to be never pregnant, having no sexual partners, and assigned the highest score in the safe sex index. The number of partners in the past
12 months questions was administered using the random response method, in which the respondent rolls a die and adds the die roll to the answer and reports the sum to
the enumerator. This conceals the true answer from the enumerator who cannot see the roll of the die.

that did not experience any violence were assigned the maximum score of 40. Respondents with a score below 23 on our inverted scale (equivalent to above 17 in the

_Program impacts_

We assessed the causal effects of GE and GE þ on seven domains
(Fig. 2), which are presented in greater detail in Tables 1–7 Our primary
outcome was sexual violence, the self-reported rates of which are very
high in the study population: for example, 33.0% reported having been
raped during the 24-month period between baseline and endline data
collection (Table 1). Almost everyone (94.8%) reported having experi­
enced physical violence during the same period. Neither GE nor GE þ
had a statistically significant effect on the sexual violence index (or on


physical violence). The standardized effects of either program on the
schooling index were small (β, � 0.07) and not statistically significant at
the 95% level of confidence (Table 2). 16% of the study population of
15-16-year-old females at endline were not enrolled in school during the
2016-17 school year. Both programs caused significant improvements in
the standardized SRH index; the coefficient estimate of the ITT effect
was more than 50% higher in GE þ than GE (GE: 0.244 SDs, p<0.01;
GEþ: 0.372 SDs, p<0.01; F-test for GE ¼ GEþ: p ¼ 0.075). This benefit
was apparent in four of the five index components – never married,
never had sex, number of sexual partners in the past 12 months, and the

The gender norms and child rearing indices are based on questions administered to the primary caregiver of the adolescent female respondent. Please refer to the preanalysis plan in the appendix for index creation and the construction of index sub-components. 40 adolescent female respondents from baseline were lost to the 24month follow-up, leaving 1,176 individuals who were interviewed at endline. Of these 1,176 individuals, the primary caregivers of 1,078 were succesfully interviewed
at the 24-month follow-up. The sample is limited to only those observations with no item non-response for any of the index components or sub-components. Robustness
of impact findings to how item non-response was handled is presented in Appendix A. Missing baseline covariates were replaced with the sample mean. If more than
10% of a baseline covariate was missing, an indicator variable for missing baseline covariate was also included in the regression and reported in the table.


safe sex index (Table 3). The safe sex index includes questions on the
frequency of condom use during the past 12 months and whether a
condom was used the last time the respondent had sex. The effects on all
index components are meaningfully larger in GE þ than GE, but the
study is only powered to detect differences in the overall index between
GE and GEþ, and not for individual index components.
We also assessed program impacts on the health, gender attitudes,
and knowledge of the study participants. Both variants of GE raised the
psychosocial index by about 0.1 SD, but these effects were not statisti­
cally significant. Three quarters of the study population suffered
elevated levels of distress, based on their Children’s Revised Impact of
Event Scale (CRIES8) scores – a PTSD scale (Table 4). Consenting par­
ticipants with high CRIES8 scores received a visit from an IRC social
worker to provide them with counseling and referrals to health service
providers. Both programs had significantly higher standardized index
scores on Gender Attitudes compared to those in the control group (GE:
0.206 SD, p<0.05; GEþ: 0.228 SD, p<0.05). This benefit was seen for
both components of the index – gender equity and attitudes towards IPV
– with no statistically significant differences in impacts between GE and
GEþ (Table 5). We also found that girls in either program had higher
standardized index scores on Life Skills (GE: 0.224 SDs, p<0.05; GEþ:
0.289 SDs, p<0.01) and the benefit was apparent in three of the five
components of the index – knowledge of HIV, financial literacy, and
knowledge of condom effectiveness (Table 6). Finally, neither variant of
GE had a detectable effect on an index of protective factors for the
beneficiaries, which include their social capital, the attitudes of their
primary caregivers towards gender equity and their aspirations for their
daughters in terms of their education, age at first marriage and preg­
nancy, and labor market participation (Table 7).
Adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing, i.e. for the likelihood of
finding statistically significant treatment effects on the seven indices
when comparing the combined GE program to the control group by
chance, did not alter the main takeaways from Tables 1–7 discussed
above. For the three domains on which the program had statistically
significant effects, the False Discovery Rate-adjusted (FDR) q-values
were all below 0.05 (SRH: FDR q ¼ 0.004, Gender Attitudes: FDR q ¼
0.014, Life Skills: FDR q ¼ 0.014).


**Discussion**

The Girl Empower program was not successful in attaining its primary
goal, which was to reduce the incidence of sexual violence experienced
by adolescent females. As the program did not increase the protective
factors surrounding adolescent girls – the social network of program
beneficiaries was not affected, nor were the caregivers’ gender attitudes
or their aspirations for the girl children – it is perhaps not surprising that
the incidence of sexual violence experienced by program beneficiaries
did not decline (Yount et al., 2017). While Liberia has signed interna­
tional laws that protect women and girls, customary laws like early
marriage are still practiced in some communities, while at the same time
forbidding discussing sexual education openly or with children. It is also
possible that within the combined post-Ebola and post-conflict envi­
ronment, factors discussed by Kelly et al. (2018) (Kelly et al., 2018),
such as greater habituation to conflict, weakening of social support
structures, shifts in family roles and responsibilities, and disruption of
peaceful conflict resolution practices, prevented the hypothesized
impact. The Girl Empower program engaged with girls and parents, but
it did not have a systematic strategy to engage with community struc­
tures on these topics. In addition, while Girl Empower trained service
providers on gender-based violence response for adolescent girls, there
were few service providers in the area, often far from Girl Empower
implementation sites. The dearth of services also includes mental health
and psychosocial support for adolescent girls who experienced violence,
in order to help them heal and recover as well as cope with continued
risks of violence in their homes, schools, communities, play grounds,
and market places. While program effects on schooling and psycholog­
ical wellbeing were positive, the standardized effect sizes were small
(approximately 0.1 SD or less) and statistically non-significant. The
small effects on education (statistically non-significant in GE and only
significant at the 90% level of confidence in GEþ in Table 2) are
consistent with evaluations of similar “safe spaces” programs for
adolescent females (Bandiera et al., forthcoming; Buchmann et al.,
2018).
Both programs did, however, seem to have moderate and statistically
significant effects on three domains: Gender Attitudes, Life Skills, and
SRH. The effects of both GE and GEþ were above 0.2 SD for all three
indices, and as large as 0.37 SD for the SRH index in GEþ. Beneficiaries

of both programs were less likely to be accepting of IPV and they showed
a better understanding of condom effectiveness, HIV/AIDS, and finan­
cial matters, such as saving, budgeting, borrowing, etc. They were also
3.6 percentage points (or 46%) less likely to be married, had a lower
number of sexual partners (0.58 fewer partners, 43% lower), and were
more likely to practice safer sex compared with the control group.
GE and GE þ produced similar impacts in all but one domain. The
effect size on the SRH index, as well as each of its components, was
approximately 50% higher in GE þ than GE. GE þ reduced the likeli­
hood of marriage and the number of sexual partners in the past 12
months by more than 50%. Our ex ante hypothesis as to why GE þ may
be more effective than GE was that the small cash incentives for atten­
dance would increase program participation in the target population.
Attendance, however, was similarly high in both GE and GEþ. While the
cash incentives increased the likelihood of caregivers attending the
monthly sessions, we do not think that the modest increase in caregiver


attendance (6.80 vs. 7.45 out of a total of eight sessions) can explain the
differential effects on SRH. As mentioned above, the program had no
effect on caregivers’ gender attitudes or their aspirations for the girl
children. So, what explains the higher impacts on SRH in GE þ than GE?
A potential mechanism is a pure income effect. Previous studies have
shown that positive income shocks can reduce early marriages and teen
pregnancies in both developing (Baird et al., 2011, 2012; Robinson &
Yeh, 2011) and developed countries (Hankins & Hoekstra, 2011). Study
participants in both GE and GE þ received the US$2/month savings
payments, for a modest sum of US$16 during the Girl Empower program,
which were provided unconditionally, i.e. not tied to program partici­
pation. While the original study design envisioned the participation
incentives to be small (US$0.50 per session attended) in order to mini­
mize the possibility of a direct income effect on the outcomes of interest,
the actual incentive payment was US$1.25 per session attended – due to
a miscommunication between the study team and the IRC Liberia staff.


-----

As mentioned earlier, the implied transfer to the caregiver of a regular
program participant of approximately US$6/month constitutes more
than 10% of per capita consumption in Liberia (World Bank, 2018), and
likely more in the study area, because Nimba is a poorer than average
rural county in Liberia. As such, it represents a non-negligible increase to
household income during the 8-month program, which could have
directly affected child marriage and sexual behavior among GE þ ben­
eficiaries. However, the fact that the 24-month follow-up data was
collected approximately one year after the last cash transfer payment
also raises the possibility of an indirect income effect: perhaps, the
additional income provided the space for the GE þ participants to better
internalize the lessons from the mentoring program and to reinforce
their newly obtained knowledge and skills towards sustained behavior
change. All participating caregivers were engaged in sessions on the
effects of sexual abuse and early marriage on adolescent girls, their
families, and the community at large. While the caregivers in the GE þ
groups were free to use the cash transfers as they saw fit, they were
encouraged to use these funds in ways that would promote the adoles­
cent girls’ safety and well-being. In this scenario, a positive interaction
effect between the mentoring program and cash transfers would produce
a larger effect than either mentoring or cash transfers alone. However,
since we did not include a study arm providing cash transfers alone, we
cannot formally test this hypothesis.
Other trials that included a similar safe spaces, mentoring, or
empowerment intervention targeted to adolescent females do not seem
particularly helpful in providing further evidence on the relative roles of
program components. A trial that contrasted an empowerment program
with a incentives (in the form of cooking oil to the parents) conditional
on the adolescent female not getting married until the age of 18 found
that the conditional transfer program was effective in reducing child
marriage and teen fertility, but the empowerment program was not.
Both programs had small effects on school participation and attainment
and there were no complementarities between the two (Buchmann et al.,
2018). The nature of the in-kind transfer (conditional on not getting
married as a child) is quite different than complementing the empow­
erment program with small transfers conditional on attendance, limiting
the applicability of those findings to this study in Liberia. Another trial
evaluating the effects of providing vocational and life skills through
girls’ clubs in Uganda found that it was highly effective in reducing early
marriage, teen pregnancy, and nonconsensual sexual activity (Bandiera
et al., forthcoming). However, the authors are unable to comment on the
relative importance of vocational vs. life skills components of the
intervention (or that of simply having access to safe spaces to gather
and/or have access to an older mentor), but they do emphasize the
multi-faceted nature of the intervention as a possible factor behind its
success.
The study had some limitations. At baseline all interview questions
were face-to-face verbal. The same procedure was used at endline with
the exception of questions pertaining to violence, which were prerecorded in every local language so that the respondents could listen
to an audio recording of each question in the language of their choice
(with the tablet held to the ear, as if listening to a phone call), after
which their response was indicated to the female enumerator who
entered it in the tablet. This was done to ensure that the respondents
understood each question exactly, as the definitions for various types of
sexual violence experienced could be detailed and complex. While the
study was well powered to detect standardized effects of 0.1 to 0.2 SD for
any of the seven main indices in pairwise comparisons between any of
the three study arms, it was not well powered to detect impacts on in­
dividual index sub-components. Primary and secondary outcome indices
were constructed using self-reported data, which could have caused
spurious findings if there was differential misreporting between study
arms.
Girl Empower aimed to endow adolescent girls with life and financial
skills, expand their support networks, and provide them with safe spaces
to discuss topics relevant to their daily lives. The study showed that Girl


_Empower_ could equip adolescent females with important life skills,
positively influence their gender attitudes, and, perhaps most impor­
tantly, improve their sexual and reproductive health, all of which were
sustained 12 months after the end of the program. Small incentive
payments for regular attendance were effective in enhancing the impact
of the program on SRH. Future trials may experiment with comparing
_Girl Empower_ with cost-equivalent cash transfers, in addition to _Girl_
_Empower plus cash as we have done here. It is also important, however,_
to identify how programs like Girl Empower can be modified or enhanced
to reduce the sexual abuse of adolescent girls, the rates of which are
unacceptably high, especially in conflict and post-conflict settings like
the one studied here.
