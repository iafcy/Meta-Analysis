**Purpose: Dating violence (DV)—physical, sexual, and psychological aggression in adolescent ro-**
mantic relationships—is prevalent among youth. Despite broad calls for primary prevention, few
programs with demonstrated effectiveness exist. This cluster-randomized trial examined the effectiveness of a DV perpetration prevention program targeting coaches and high school male athletes.
**Methods: The unit of randomization was the high school (16 schools), and the unit of analysis was the**
athlete(N � 2,006students).Primaryoutcomeswereintentionstointervene,recognitionofabusivebehaviors, and gender-equitable attitudes. Secondary outcomes explored bystander behaviors and abuse perpetration. Regression models for clustered, longitudinal data assessed between-arm differences in over-time
changes in mean levels of continuous outcomes in 1,798 athletes followed up at 3 months.
**Results: Intervention athletes’ changes in intentions to intervene were positive compared with**
control subjects, resulting in an estimated intervention effect of .12 (95% CI: .003, .24). Intervention
athletes also reported higher levels of positive bystander intervention behavior than control
subjects (.25, 95% CI: .13, .38). Changes in gender-equitable attitudes, recognition of abusive
behaviors, and DV perpetration were not significant. Secondary analyses estimated intervention
impacts according to intensity of program implementation. Compared with control subjects, athletes exposed to full-intensity implementation of the intervention demonstrated improvements in
intentions to intervene (.16, 95% CI: .04, .27), recognition of abusive behaviors (.13, 95% CI: .003, .25),
and positive bystander intervention (.28, 95% CI: .14, .41).
**Conclusion: This cluster-randomized controlled trial supports the effectiveness of a school athlet-**
ics-based prevention program as one promising strategy to reduce DV perpetration.

**IMPLICATIONS AND**
**CONTRIBUTION**

DV is prevalent among adolescents. Recent prevention
efforts target attitudes that
legitimize violence perpetration by engaging men
and boys to intervene when
witnessing harmful behaviors. Evaluation of this athletic coach-delivered violence prevention program
showed increases in high
school male athletes’ intentions to intervene and actual bystander intervention
behaviors.

Dating violence (DV)—physical, sexual, and psychological aggression in adolescent romantic relationships—is prevalent
among youth, with one in three U.S. girls reporting physical,
emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner [1]. Despite
broad calls for primary DV prevention [2,3], few programs with
demonstrated effectiveness exist.

Attitudes that legitimize DV perpetration have been identified as modifiable perpetration risk factors [4–12]. Because DV
perpetration often emerges in the context of male peers who
demonstrate negative attitudes toward women and promote
abuse perpetration [13–15], prevention requires addressing perpetrator attitudes and behaviors as well as the peer environment
in which they are embedded. Studies suggest the utility of interventions rooted in social norms theory, which posits that individual behavior is informed by perceptions and misperceptions
of others’ attitudes and behaviors [13,16]. Engaging men and
boys to promote nonviolent, gender-equitable attitudes is increasingly recognized by major global health organizations as a
critical public health strategy to reduce violence against women

[17–19].
Perceived peer tolerance for DV may reduce men’s and boys’
comfort and ability to intervene when witnessing such negative
behaviors among their peers. The bystander approach—teaching
individuals to intervene when faced with their peers’ DV-related
behaviors, rather than respond with apathy or tolerance—could
be a powerful component of such social change [20,21]. In a
college sample, inclusion of a bystander education component
facilitated greater modification of harmful attitudes compared
with standard sexual assault training [22]. Other sexual violence
prevention programs have successfully engaged college students
to intervene when witnessing peers’ abusive behaviors [14,23–
26]. A bystander approach to address DV has not been rigorously
evaluated among high school students.
Male student athletes constitute an important target for DV
prevention, given the relatively higher prevalence of DV perpetration and endorsement of attitudes supportive of violence
against women among athletes [26,27]. Athletes also demonstrate greater leadership ability compared with nonathletes [28],
suggesting that interventions with this population may diffuse
through student populations [29–31]. Coaches are a natural ally
for such interventions; their role as influential, nonparental role
models renders them uniquely poised to positively impact how
young men think and behave [29]. Thus, training coaches to
teach adolescent male athletes to prevent DV may be a promising
strategy to increase knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors that
reduce DV perpetration. Earlier successes of athletics-based DV
interventions in college contexts [26], coupled with the high
prevalence of such abuse among high school youth, point to the
need for a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
impact of training coaches to participate in DV prevention.

**Methods**

_Recruitment and data collection_

Five large urban school districts in Sacramento County, CA,
were approached to participate in an evaluation of the “Coaching
Boys into Men” (CBIM) program in October 2009; one district
declined. Of the remaining four districts, three had 100% participation of their high schools, and 56% of high schools participated
in the fourth district, for a total of 16 schools (i.e., clusters).
Schools declined because of losing an athletics program owing to
funding cuts, as well as focusing on other academic priorities.
Each school’s athletic director approached all head coaches of
male and co-educational sports to participate each season (winter 2009–2010, spring 2010, and fall 2010). Of the coaches approached, 87% agreed to participate. The primary participation
barrier reported by coaches was lack of time.


Student athletes received parental consent forms and an informational letter (available in multiple languages) from study
staff about the study. Students who returned signed parental
consent forms and completed youth assent forms were eligible
to take the surveys. Girls were eligible, but completed a separate
female-specific survey, not included in the present analyses.
Fifteen-minute online surveys were collected at schools for intervention and control site student athletes (in grades 9 through
12) at the start of each sports season (winter, spring, fall) (time
1). Time 2 follow-up surveys were collected for these same athletes at the end of each sports season (approximately 12 weeks
after time 1, following program implementation at the intervention sites). To facilitate anonymous matching of baseline and
follow-up surveys for statistical analysis, youth self-created an
identification code by responding to questions for which only
they would know the answer. Students received a $10 gift card
for participating in each survey. Study methods were approved
by the University of California Davis Human Subjects Research
Committee and by each school district.

_Intervention and control conditions_

CBIM is intended to alter norms that foster DV perpetration by
engaging athletic coaches as positive role models to deliver violence prevention messages to adolescent male athletes. The program consists of a 60-minute training for coaches led by a trained
violence prevention advocate to introduce the Coaches Kit (avail[able at http://coachescorner.org), which provides strategies for](http://coachescorner.org)
opening conversation about violence against women with athletes. Eleven “Training Cards” guide coaches to lead brief (10–15
min) weekly discussions with athletes about respect and DV
prevention throughout the sports season. The advocate is available to assist coaches with concerns that arise during program
delivery, including disclosures. Through this brief coach-led intervention, the CBIM program is intended to translate into measurable positive changes in athletes’ attitudes and behaviors
related to DV (Figure 1).
A parallel group of athletes in schools randomized to the
control condition received coaching as usual, meaning the
coaches were asked to interact with their athletes as they customarily do, without additional guidance. These students were
assessed using identical surveys, measurement protocols, and
research staff as for the intervention condition.

_Outcomes_

_Primary knowledge, attitude, and behavior outcomes._

1. Recognition of abusive behavior: A scale developed by Silverman et al [32] to assess perceptions of the degree of abusiveness of specified relationship behaviors, such as “telling them
which friends they can or can’t see or talk to,” using a 5-point
Likert-like scale ranging from “not abusive” to “extremely
abusive” (Cronbach � � .93). Recognition of abusive behavior
was modeled as a mean of responses to 12 items.
2. Gender-equitable attitudes: This scale includes questions
modified from Barker’s Gender-Equitable Norms Scale [33],
such as “if a girl is raped it is often because she did not say no
clearly enough.” Responses range from “strongly agree” to
“strongly disagree” on a 5-point scale (Cronbach � � .80),
modeled as a mean of responses to 11 items.
3. Intentions to intervene when witnessing abusive behaviors:
These investigator-developed items were pilot tested [34]. For

each item representing abusive behaviors, participants report
how likely they would be to do something to stop the behavior. Responses range from “very unlikely” to “very likely”
(Cronbach � � .87), modeled as a mean of eight items.

_Secondary outcomes._

4–5. Positive and negative bystander intervention: Similar to
items assessing intentions to intervene, these investigatordeveloped items were piloted in a previous study intended to
identify commonly witnessed behaviors among adolescent
male athletes (Appendix 1). For each of nine abusive behaviors witnessed among peers or friends in the past 3 months,
participants reported how they responded to the behavior (if
witnessed), by selecting all applicable responses from a list
with two negative behaviors (“I didn’t say anything” and “I
laughed or went along with it”) and four positive behaviors (“I
told the person in public that acting like that was not okay”; “I
told the person in private that acting like that was not okay”;
“I talked to our coach about it privately”; “I talked to another
adult [not coach].”). For each abusive behavior, separate binary indicators (for any positive and for any negative intervention) were created. If an abusive behavior was not witnessed, both indicators were coded 0. The nine positive and
nine negative indicators were summarized separately to createthepositiveandnegativebystanderinterventionbehavior
scores.
6. Abuse perpetration: Athletes who had ever dated a female
were asked about perpetrating any of 10 abusive behaviors
toward a female partner in the past 3 months, modified from
the Conflict Tactics Scale 2 [35], with additional items tested
during a separate pilot study [34]. A summary DV perpetration score was created by adding together any “yes”
responses.

_Sample size_

Power and sample size estimates were calculated from analyses of pilot study data, incorporating outcome-specific variance
inflation factor estimates that accounted for cluster randomization design effects and nonresponse to translate the anticipated
sample size of 1,500 athletes from 14 schools into outcomespecific effective sample sizes of 750, 395, and 221 for the primary knowledge, attitudes, and behavior outcomes, respec

tively, sufficient to achieve �80% power (under two-sided
testing with � � 5%) to detect minimum standardized effects of
interest [36]. Actual sample size exceeded these targets, as more
schools agreed to participate (16 clusters) and the study enrolled
more than 2,000 athletes at baseline.

_Randomization_

After all schools were enrolled, the study statistician developed the computer-generated random allocation schedule, ensuring that each school had an equal chance of being randomized
to either arm.

_Statistical methods_

In light of the intensity of within-school interactions
among coaches, athletes, and nonathlete peers, the unit of
randomization for this trial was the high school, and the unit
of analysis was the athlete. To account for the clustered randomized study design and the hierarchical arrangement of our
data (up to two measurements per athlete, nested within
team, nested within school, the unit of randomization), a
combination of survey data analysis methods and multilevel
mixed-effects models in SAS/STAT software (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) were used [36–38]. Bivariate tests of association and
differences in means were adjusted for design effects, specifying schools as clusters. Adjusted between-arm differences in
over-time changes in mean levels of continuous outcomes
were used to estimate intervention effects and to adjust for
baseline differences in outcomes, race, grade, immigration
status, and parental education. These were assessed using
mixed-effects models for all outcomes except for the bystander intervention outcomes, where clustered data regression point and variance estimates were used, to account for
heteroskedasticity. The primary assessment of intervention
effects analyzed all available data from athletes who completed follow-up. A secondary analysis was conducted to assess whether intervention effects were stronger with more
intensive uptake of the intervention. Two-sided testing with a
per-comparison � of 5% was used for all study hypotheses,
with corresponding single-inference 95% confidence intervals
reported for intervention effects on each outcome.

**Results**

_Participant flow and attrition analysis_

Figure 2 illustrates the randomization of schools and flow of
athletes through the study.
Two hundred eight athletes were lost to follow-up (10.4%),
with more athletes lost to follow-up in the intervention schools.
These athletes were more likely to be non-Hispanic black and
less likely to be white, compared with athletes who completed
the study. Those lost to follow-up were slightly less likely at
baseline to recognize abusive behaviors than those retained; no
differences were found regarding baseline values of other study
outcomes.

_Baseline data_

The male high school athletes in this study included all grade
levels equally (Table 1). Self-reported race/ethnicity by the athletes


reflected the race/ethnicity composition of each school. Control
athletes were more likely to be white and to have a parent who had
completed college or graduate school. The sports included were
basketball and wrestling (winter); baseball, golf, lacrosse, rugby,
swimming, tennis, track-and-field, and volleyball (spring); and
cross-country, football, soccer, and water polo (fall).
Eighteen percent of athletes reported any abuse perpetration
against a female partner in the past 3 months. The mean summary scores for past 3-month abuse perpetration were �1 at
baseline and similar in both intervention and control arms
(where the highest possible score was 10), meaning that few
athletes reported perpetrating more than one abusive behavior
against a female partner. Emotional and verbal abuse were the
most common DV perpetration reported (Table 2).

tervene, gender-equitable attitudes, and negative bystander intervention scales (p � .05) (Table 3). Regarding “intentions to
intervene,” control athletes’ adjusted mean scores decreased
(i.e., worsened) somewhat over time (adjusted mean change �
�.08; p � .07, not statistically significant), whereas intervention
athletes’ mean scores remained stable (adjusted mean change �
.04; p � .29), resulting in an estimated intervention effect of .12


(95% CI: .003–.24). Intervention effects on gender-equitable attitudes (�.01; 95% CI: �.09, .07) and on recognition of abuse (.06;
95% CI: �.06, .17) were not statistically significant.

_Secondary outcomes_

Intervention athletes showed a significant increase in positive bystander intervention behavior compared with control
subjects (.25, 95% CI: .13, .38). Changes in DV perpetration and
negative bystander behavior across intervention and control
arms were not statistically significant in adjusted analyses
(Table 3).

_Post hoc analyses based on intervention intensity_

According to program guidelines, the minimum requirements for completed intervention delivery (i.e., “full intensity”)
are coaches’ discussions of at least 9 of the 11 training cards and
these discussions being conducted across a minimum of onethird of the sports season (i.e., 4 weeks). Based on coaches’
biweekly phone or e-mail contact with the violence prevention
advocate as well as a tracking sheet the coaches completed about
which card was delivered on what date and for what length of
time, 60.3% of the intervention coaches fulfilled these criteria and
were scored “1.00” on intervention intensity. All the intervention
coaches reported implementing at least some portion of CBIM,
thus the remaining intervention coaches were given discounted
scores between .5 and 1.0 to reflect the number of cards discussed and weeks spent implementing the program. The primary
reason coaches offered for not completing the cards in the intended sequence was not having time in their practice schedule
to have these discussions with their athletes. In addition, owing
to personal time constraints, some of the coaches were trained
after the start of their sports season, and had fewer weeks in
which to complete the series.
Intensity-adjusted intervention effects were estimated by
substituting the intervention intensity score in place of the
binary intervention indicator used in the primary analysis (far
right column, Table 3). In addition to the same outcomes
with statistically significant effects in the primary analyses,

For all scores, except for negative intervention behavior and abuse perpetration, higher scores denote more positive change, that is, higher score in “intentions to
intervene” indicates athletes reporting greater likelihood to intervene.
For negative intervention behavior and abuse perpetration, higher scores indicate more negative intervention behaviors and abuse perpetration reported.
Analysis restricted to 1,798 athletes who completed follow-up. Adjusted intervention effects were estimated in multiple regression models that adjusted for race, grade,
parental education, and immigrant status. Adjusted intervention effects represent the between-arm contrast in mean over-time changes in study outcomes. Secondary
analyses estimate intervention effect for athletes exposed to programs with full implementation of the intervention (see text for details). Mixed-effects longitudinal
models for a nested cohort design (with random effects for schools, for school changes over time, for teams nested within schools, and for athletes nested within teams)
that used restricted maximum likelihood estimation were used for point estimates and confidence intervals for all outcomes except for the two bystander intervention
outcomes, for which survey data regression analysis methods for clustered data (with schools specified as clusters and with the athlete’s baseline value included as a
covariate in models with follow-up values as the dependent variable) were used to provide heteroskedasticity-robust confidence intervals. The estimated intracluster
correlation coefficients from the nested cohort analysis of our primary outcomes are computed as the ratio of the estimated variance component for the school-specific
changes to the sum of this variance component and the estimated residual error variance component and equal .036, .028, and .024 for the intention to intervene, gender
attitudes, and recognition of abuse scores, respectively.


intensity-adjusted intervention effects were associated with
increases in recognition of abuse.

**Discussion**

_Interpretation_

This cluster-randomized controlled trial supports the effectiveness of a school athletics-based prevention program as one
promising strategy that may help reduce DV perpetration among
male adolescents. Compared with control participants, athletes
assigned to the CBIM intervention reported increased intentions
to intervene and more positive bystander behavior. In secondary
analyses that adjusted for the intensity of intervention delivery
(at the program level), full implementation of the intervention
was also associated with better recognition of abuse.
This program builds on social norms change theory to increase bystander behavior related to DV prevention. It is encouraging that this easy-to-implement, coach-delivered prevention
program was able to achieve small-to-moderate effect sizes using rigorous (and conservative) analyses for both intentions to
intervene and positive bystander behavior. Even with limited
time available for training coaches and short discussions with
athletes (constrained by parameters set by coaches to integrate
this program into busy athletic program schedules), the shifts in
bystander behavior observed are congruent with the proposed
conceptual model for this program (Figure 1). Among control
athletes, the slight decline in intentions to intervene and positive
bystander behaviors at follow-up might also reflect that in the
absence of such specific DV education, the peer context of high
school male athletes may increasingly dissuade youth from being positive bystanders during this critical developmental period. Furthermore, emotional and verbal abuse perpetration toward a female partner appeared to increase among control
athletes (Table 2), suggesting that the peer context may in fact
encourage such behaviors. The overall increase in intentions to
intervene and positive bystander intervention behaviors demon

strated among intervention athletes compared with control subjects suggests the program may protect against the negative
effects of a social context that discourages bystander intervention, a hypothesis that merits further study.
In the intensity-adjusted analyses, statistically significant effect estimates also emerged for recognition of abusive behaviors.
Only 60% of the coaches delivered the intervention as intended,
pointing to the need to better understand barriers in implementing this program and identifying strategies to assist coaches to
deliver the entire program throughout the sports season, which
may be helpful for increasing program effectiveness.
Incidence of physical or sexual violence perpetrated by athletes who had ever dated was low, suggesting that the timing of
this program, which targets high school-aged athletes, is appropriate for primary prevention. There was no statistically significant difference in overall recent DV perpetration comparing intervention and control athletes who had ever dated. Sexual
violence prevention programs among college students, which
used a bystander approach, have demonstrated not only improvements in bystander intervention behaviors [23] but also
reductions in sexual aggression perpetration [24]. Similarly, bystander intervention approaches with elementary school students to reduce bullying behaviors [39] and with middle school
students to reduce sexual harassment [40] have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing perpetration behaviors. Our
intervention may not have detected significant effects on selfreported abuse perpetration, as the outcome measured was DV
perpetration toward a female partner only (not abusive behaviors against any female more broadly). In addition, it is possible
that, over time, the increased positive bystander behaviors may
create a social context that discourages DV and sexual violence
perpetration. Longitudinal research is needed to explore the
longer-term impact of this program on overall perpetration behaviors beyond just in romantic relationships.
The CBIM program did not appear to have an effect on genderequitable attitudes, which suggests that masculinity scripts, including attitudes that condone sexual violence, may be less ame

nable to change. Instead, CBIM effects may operate through
increasing recognition of what constitutes abusive behaviors and
increasing youth self-efficacy to intervene (i.e., strengthening
the context for more positive bystanders to emerge), rather than
fundamentally influencing gender attitudes. The theory that increasing bystander behaviors over time will result in shifts toward more gender-equitable attitudes and less violence perpetration remains to be tested.

_Generalizability_

As a cluster-randomized trial located in urban, racially and
economically diverse public school districts in California, the
findings from this study may not generalize to students in private
schools, suburban or rural areas. The study was restricted to
youth who returned signed parental consents and were present
in school to complete both baseline and follow-up surveys (i.e.,
athlete selection bias), and the engagement of willing coaches
and athletic departments within intervention schools may have
introduced additional selection bias. Although the cluster randomization at the school level was intended to address such
biases, it is possible that the intervention arm differed from the
control arm in unmeasured ways. In addition, the program content specifically focuses on adolescent male behaviors toward
females, and does not address DV among same-sex couples or
sexual violence occurring outside of relationships.

_Limitations_

These findings should be considered in light of several limitations. First, reliance on self-report of abuse perpetration and
bystander intervention may result in underestimates of these
behaviors. The use of a self-generated anonymous code and computerized survey administration were intended to reduce underreporting of sensitive items. Second, CBIM was presented to the
coaches as a voluntary program, thus despite frequent contact
with coaches to support fidelity to intervention, some coaches
delivered the program in ways that differed from original intention. The secondary analyses, which incorporated an intensity
score, were conducted to examine whether stronger effects of
the program would emerge among athletes known to have been
exposed to the program as intended. Third, control school athletes were exposed only to coaching as usual, without any additional program. Although it is possible that the observed changes
in the intervention arm were related to having a coach simply
paying greater attention to their athletes, the changes in recognition of abusive behaviors indicate a change in knowledge related to program content, suggesting that program effects extend
beyond simple coach engagement with their athletes. In addition, the nature of the sample and potential selection biases may
temper the generalizability of these findings to diverse youth
settings. Finally, whether intervention effects last beyond the
immediate postseason remains to be seen.

_Overall evidence_

These limitations notwithstanding, this cluster-randomized
controlled trial found that a brief athletic coach-led DV prevention program for high school-aged male athletes is associated
with small-to-moderate increases in youth intentions to intervene in peer abuse perpetration, positive bystander behaviors,
and recognition of abusive behaviors. CBIM offers several inno

vations to the field of DV prevention: (1) engaging nontraditional
allies, namely, coaches, as active participants in violence prevention; (2) translating the success of bystander programs among
college students to a high school population; (3) focusing on
shifting gender norms and bystander behaviors related to violence against women; (4) ensuring relevance to the setting and
population by using real-world examples where messages to
athletes are tailored by coaches. The ease of implementation of
CBIM, that is, short training time and straightforward weekly
mini-sessions that are simple to deliver, may facilitate its
uptake among coaches in diverse settings. CBIM may be a
useful adjunct to school-based violence prevention efforts to
reduce DV perpetration.
