Abstract
Dating abuse (DA) is prevalent and consequential, yet there are no evidence-based interventions for the health care setting that
prevent perpetration. The current study’s purpose was to test a one-session brief motivational interview-style intervention to
decrease DA perpetration. We conducted a two-arm RCT of the Real Talk intervention with follow-up at 3 and 6 months.
Participants were 172 youth ages 15–19 years old, recruited from the pediatric emergency department or outpatient care services
of an urban hospital in the USA in 2014–2017. The primary outcome was change in self-reported DA perpetration, including
subtypes of DA such as physical, sexual, psychological, and cyber DA. Youth in both intervention and control arms reduced DA
perpetration over time. GEE models indicated no overall intervention effects for any, physical, sexual, or psychological DA.
There were overall effects for cyber DA (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27, 0.87). There were also effects at 3 months for psychological DA
(RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06, 0.93) and cyber DA (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19, 0.79). Analyses stratified by gender also found overall
effects for males for any DA (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07, 0.55), physical DA (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10, 0.89), and cyber DA (RR 0.04,
95% CI 0.01, 0.27). For males, intervention effects on any DA persisted to 6 months (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02, 1.01). This health
care-based one-session DA intervention is a potentially promising approach to reduce DA perpetration among adolescents.

Dating abuse (DA) is a prevalent and consequential problem.
Ten percent of US high school-attending boys and 21% of
girls who date experience physical or sexual DAvictimization
annually (Vagi et al. 2015). DA victimization can have substantial adverse consequences including depression,
suicidality, disordered eating, increased risk for being re-victimized, injuries, and even death (Ackard et al. 2007; Coker
et al. 2000; Exner-Cortens et al. 2013).

Psychological partner abuse, which may include threats,
insults, or coercive or intimidating behaviors (Baker et al.
2018), is a form of DA that often co-occurs with physical
and sexual DA (Sullivan et al. 2012), and carries a risk of even
more severe and long-lasting harms than physical abuse
(O’Leary 1999). Psychological DA is also more prevalent
than physical and sexual DA victimization among adolescents. According to a nationally representative survey of US
youth, as many as 66% of 12–18 year olds have experienced
psychological abuse in their lifetimes, while 18% have experienced lifetime physical DA victimization (Taylor and
Mumford 2016).
It is now accepted that providing help to victims, while
ignoring perpetration, is insufficient to make a populationlevel sea-change (US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention 2016). In the past decade, experts have encouraged
the development of prevention strategies designed to stop DA
perpetration with the hope of achieving more sizable reductions in the incidence than have been achieved to date (US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2016). This is a
logical step, as there appear to be nearly as many adolescents


-----

who have ever perpetrated DA as who have experienced it as
victims (63% vs. 69%, respectively), and only a small minority, 12% of boys and 9% of girls, report only ever experiencing
DA victimization and never engaging in perpetration (Taylor
and Mumford 2016).
Girls appear to be as likely as boys to report that they have
perpetrated physical DA in adolescence (Taylor and Mumford
2016), though the consequences of DA on female and male
victims may differ. Girls are more likely than boys to sustain
injuries or feel fear when victimized and to experience fatal
DA (Jaffe et al. 2018). Importantly, there have been calls for
interventions for young women who perpetrate DA, given that
no effective interventions have yet been identified (Leisring
2013). Some nationally representative studies have found that
Black and Hispanic youth are at heightened risk for DA
(Halpern et al. 2001; Raiford et al. 2007), though other studies
have found nearly equivalent rates by racial and ethnic subgroup (Ybarra et al. 2016). Regardless, there have been calls
for increased attention to reducing DA among Black and
Hispanic youth, and developing culturally informed DA prevention efforts, as part of the broader effort to decrease health
inequities overall (Bent-Goodley 2001).
To date, the main strategy for preventing DA has been
school-based primary prevention programs that teach teenagers about healthy relationships. While some of these programs appear to have modest effects on DA-related knowledge and attitudes, adolescents’ behavior is rarely influenced
substantially, with some exceptions (De La Rue et al. 2017).
As a result, there is an increasing interest in identifying secondary and tertiary prevention interventions designed to stop
perpetration (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
2016). There is also an interest in identifying interventions for
settings other than schools, given that historically some
schools have protested that they are over-saturated with prevention programming, and because not all youth attend or
graduate from high school (Institute of Medicine and
Committee on Comprehensive School Health Programs in
Grades K-12 1997).
Embedding a preventive intervention within primary care
could be ideal given the overwhelming majority of adolescents that visit their doctors annually (Sege 2011).
Importantly, the American Academy of Pediatrics now emphasizes that “Early anticipatory guidance about ...relationship dynamics and the risks of [DA] is paramount...” (Smith
et al. 2009). Despite this call to action, few pediatricians
screen patients for DA, perhaps because there are no
evidence-based interventions that are focused on healthy dating relationships and designed to be delivered in adolescent
health care settings (Cutter-Wilson and Richmond 2011).
Effects of interventions for DA perpetration in pediatric
care settings are limited to one prior study. A one-session
emergency department-based DA perpetration intervention
for adolescents called “SafERteens,” tested with 14–18-year


old youth was found to reduce youths’ peer aggression, but
not DA perpetration (Walton et al. 2010). Other studies have
tested the effects of one-session brief interventions (BIs) on
adult partner violence perpetration. These have found either
no effect (Rhodes et al. 2015), or a small, not statistically
significant effect (Crane and Eckhardt 2013). However, given
that one-session motivational interview BIs in pediatric settings have promoted healthier alcohol- and marijuana-related
outcomes in youth (Bernstein et al. 2010, 2017), we were
encouraged to use the BI model to attempt to change DA.
The Real Talk DA intervention is a one-session brief intervention. The intervention uses motivational interviewing (MI),
which is a type of counseling that can be provided by trained
non-clinician interventionists (Rollnick and Miller 1995). In
the hospital setting, interventionists can be social workers,
nurses, patient navigators, child life specialists, or substance
abuse treatment specialists, for example. The intervention is
highly structured and manual-based. Interventionists are
trained to follow a series of 10 steps. In brief, interventionists
establish rapport with the patient, elicit reasons why it might be
worthwhile for the patient to change their DA behavior, discuss
their readiness to make a change, review strategies for behaving
less aggressively, engage the patient in a dialog about barriers
to using those strategies, and create a plan for using the strategies in the future. The interventionists also attempt to contact
each intervention participant up to three times in the 6 weeks
after the intervention session to give them a booster, which is a
reminder about the intervention content and their plan for
change. Specifically, a booster-call typically lasts 10 min or less
and involves the interventionist asking “How are you doing?”,
“Have you been thinking about what we discussed?”, and “Do
you have any questions for me?” More details about the content
of the intervention, and a videotaped example intervention, are
[available elsewhere (video link http://sites.bu.edu/rothmanlab/](http://sites.bu.edu/rothmanlab/real-talk/)
[real-talk/). The intervention is rooted in the Theory of Planned](http://sites.bu.edu/rothmanlab/real-talk/)
Behavior, Stages of Change model, and the theory of MI
(Ajzen 1991; Norcross et al. 2011; Rollnick and Miller 1995)
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
Our hypothesis was that those in the intervention group
would experience greater reductions in DA perpetration at
3 months and at 6 months than those in the control group.

## Methods

### Study Sample

Participants were 172 adolescents, 15–19 years old, who sought
medical care from the emergency or adolescent outpatient department of a large, urban, Safety Net hospital in the Northeast and
were mostly Black or Hispanic (84%) and girls (85%). The study
sample race/ethnicity reflects the race/ethnicity of the patients at
the health care institution. Safety Net hospitals are in the top


-----

quartile of US hospitals that provide care to indigent, uninsured,
or underinsured patients (Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality 2016). Recruitment took place on January 2014–January
2017. Participants were recruited from waiting or treatment
rooms. They were told that while they were waiting to see the
doctor, they could participate in a research study about dating
relationships. Eligibility criteria included perpetrating ≥ 1 acts of
physical or sexual DA in the preceding 3 months based on the
23-item inventory (described under primary outcome)
(Supplementary Table 1), English proficiency, not seeking health
care because of dating or sexual assault victimization, and being
medically stable. Of the 984 youth who were in the appropriate
age range and approached for eligibility screening, 72% (n =
712) were found ineligible due to not having perpetrated DA in
the prior 3 months. Youth were also ineligible if they had been in
a batterer intervention program, or endorsed three or more items
on a five-item dangerousness assessment, because the IRB determined that such youth were too potentially volatile for participation in our research. The IRB concern was that our intervention could aggravate more dangerous adolescents and increase
their propensity for violence; the concern was mitigated by having our research team screen out the most dangerous adolescents
and not interact with them further. The five dangerousness items
were the following: have you ever injured a dating partner so
severely that he/she required medical attention, been subject to a
restraining order by the present dating partner, police even been
called due to an incident with a partner, ever used physical force
to have sex with a dating partner, or have a weapon or know
where to get one if one was needed. Because the dangerousness
screening questions pertain to ever having had the experiences, it
was possible for a person to both answer the questions affirmatively and also not be a present threat. One individual screened
endorsed three or more of the five dangerousness items and was
found to be ineligible. An assessment was made that he presented
no immediate threat of harm to himself or others, and he was
offered standard care, which includes the option to speak to a
behavioral health specialist.
When youth > 18 years were at the hospital with a parent or
guardian, both parental consent and youth assent were obtained. In cases when youth were > 18 years old, but attending
their health care appointment without a parent/guardian and
making their own health care-related decisions, they could
assent to study participation and no parent/guardian consent
was sought. Of the 272 individuals eligible for study participation, 81% provided informed assent/consent and were enrolled in the study. All procedures were approved by the first
author’s IRB.

### Randomization

Participants were assigned to the intervention treatment condition or the control condition using permuted block randomization via index cards in sequenced envelopes that were


opened by study staff after baseline assessments were completed (Lachin et al. 1988). Of the 220 patients that were
randomized, 50% were allocated to intervention (n = 110),
and 50% were allocated to control (n = 110) (Fig. 1). Four
participants in the intervention arm were withdrawn for administrative reasons (see Fig. 1). Of the 216, 44 (22%) did not
contribute any follow-up data at 3 months or 6 months and
were not included in the analyses. Thus, the analytic sample
was n = 172 at baseline.

Intervention and Control Conditions

Those assigned to the intervention participated in a 30–45-min
brief MI-style intervention conducted by a trained non-clinician. Detail about the development and pilot-testing of the
intervention is described elsewhere (Rothman and Wang
2016). Interventionists were local community members who
had prior experience in DA education with youth or were
Master in Public Health (MPH) students. All interventionists
went through a standardized 20-h training provided by the PI.
The training included didactic information about MI and brief
interventions, reading about MI, watching MI videos, and
roleplaying the intervention with the PI a minimum of three
times. Consistent with other MI interventions, the 10 steps of
Real Talk included (1) establishing a rapport; (2) eliciting
information about DA perpetration; (3) providing tailored
feedback; (4) assessing readiness to change; (5) reviewing
healthy relationship strategy choices; (6) contemplating the
pros and cons of behavior change; (7) identifying barriers to
change; (8) re-assessing readiness to change; (9) making referrals to desired resources; and (10) 1–3 supportive booster
calls in the 6 weeks following the intervention. Fidelity of
intervention delivery was assessed by scoring audio recordings of intervention sessions using a checklist that scored the
intervention on introduction and assessment (15 points), detailed assessment (20 points), feedback (20 points), eliciting a
change plan (15 points), strategies for addressing barriers (15
points), and reassessing readiness to change (15 points). All
intervention sessions scored in the 90–100% range. The PI
assessed the fidelity of 20% of the sessions and a trained RA
assessed the fidelity of the remaining 80%. Those assigned to
the control condition were given a booklet about DA perpetration and hotline numbers for domestic violence, sexual assault, runaway, and suicide.

### Outcomes

Youth outcome measures were collected immediately prior to
the intervention, 3 months after the intervention, and 6 months
after the intervention. Baseline outcomes were assessed via
self-report paper-based surveys which took approximately
15 min. Follow-up data were collected via surveys that were
emailed to participants (64% and 71% at 3 and 6 months,


-----

Fig. 1 CONSORT diagram; US
study 2014–2017

respectively) (Supplementary Table 2), paper-based surveys at
a location of participants’ choosing (e.g., the hospital, a local
library) (22% and 21% at 3 and 6 months respectively), or
over the phone (14% and 8% at 3 and 6 months, respectively).
Participants were remunerated $20 for completing baseline
surveys, $25 for 3 month surveys, and $30 for 6 month surveys. Approximately 78% of participants contributed data at
either 3 or 6 months (Fig. 1). There were some differences in
the demographics of those who were retained vs. lost to
follow-up; those lost to follow-up were less likely to be
Black than another race, more likely to have been recruited
from the outpatient setting instead of the emergency department, and to report DA victimization at baseline. However,
loss to follow-up patterns did not vary by study group assignment (Supplementary Table 2).

### Primary Outcome: Dating Abuse Perpetration

The primary outcome was DA perpetration which was categorized as any vs. no DA, and also as any vs. no physical DA,
sexual DA, psychological DA, and cyber DA. DA perpetration was assessed using a 23-item measure established as valid


and reliable, including subscales for physical, sexual, and psychological DA (Goncy and Rothman 2019). Respondents
were asked how frequently in the past 3 months they had done
any of a list of acts to a dating or sexual partner. Instructions
specified only to include acts that they did first, in other words,
not in self-defense, and not to include incidents when they
were joking around. Response options were 0 times, 1–3
times, 4–9 times, and ≥ 10 times. The Cronbach’s alpha was
α = 0.82 at baseline, 0.94 at time 1, and 0.96 at time 2.
Dummy variables indicating “any” versus “no” perpetration
were created for each time-point, where 0 represented no DA
perpetration and 1 represented any DA perpetration.
In addition to calculating an overall score for any DA perpetration, we also created dummy variables to indicate any or no
abuse for four DA subtypes: physical, sexual, psychological, and
cyber. Physical abuse included any of the following 16 acts:
scratched, slapped, physically twisted their arm, slammed them
or held them against a wall, kicked them, bent their fingers, bit
them, tried to choke them, gave them an injury (or hurt them so
that they needed medical attention), threw something at them that
hit them, burned them, hit them with a fist, hit them with something hard besides a fist, beat them up, assaulted them with a


-----

knife or gun, and pushed, grabbed or shoved them. The internal
consistency for the physical DA subscale was good (α = 0.83).
Sexual DAwas assessed via two items: forced them to have sex,
or forced them to do other sexual things that they did not want to
do. Psychological abuse was assessed via four items which included threatened to kill them, said that I would die, or kill
myself, if we broke up, spread nasty rumors about them, and
made them feel afraid. These four items had good internal consistency (α = 0.88). Cyber abuse was assessed via a single question about breaking into their email or cell phone.

### Covariate: Readiness to Change

Ten items from the University of Rhode Island Change
Assessment (URICA) were used to assess stage of change
(Pantalon et al. 2002). A scale score was calculated by adding
all 10 items and subtracting the two items that represent
precontemplation, consistent with the recommended scoring
for the original (Levesque et al. 2000). Research suggests that
shortened versions of the URICA, as used in the present study,
correlate highly with the full instrument (Amodei and Lamb
2004; Carey et al. 1999). The alpha for the scale in this sample
was 0.75 at baseline, 0.78 at time 1, and 0.81 at time 2.

### Statistical Approach

Our study was powered to detect an absolute difference of 15
percentage points between groups with 95% confidence and
80% power (60% vs. 45%) which required a sample of 171
participants. Baseline characteristics were investigated using t
tests for continuous distributed variables and chi-square and
Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables (Table 1). To examine the effects of the intervention, we used generalized
estimating equations (GEEs) log-binomial regression for longitudinal data with an unstructured correlation matrix to model the relative risk of DA perpetration at follow-up. Given our
eligibility criteria, all participants reported any abuse and
physical abuse perpetration at baseline, and analyses for these
outcomes examined differences between the intervention and
control groups at 3 and 6 months. We first fit a main effect
model with indicators for study group and time that estimates
a common intervention RR, pooling data from 3 and 6 months.
We then fit a multiplicative interaction model, with an interaction term between study group and time, to estimate differential intervention effects at 3 and 6 months. For sexual, psychological, and cyber abuse, analyses controlled for baseline
behavior by including data from baseline, 3, and 6 months in
the analysis. The intervention RR for these models represents
differential change from baseline to post-intervention in the
intervention vs. control group. With these outcomes, we also
first fit a model to estimate a common intervention RR
pooling data from 3 and 6 months. We then fit an interaction
model to estimate differential intervention effects at 3 and


6 months. We ran both unadjusted and adjusted models.
Adjusted analyses included contemplation stage of readiness
to change as a covariate because prior studies of the effect of
brief MI interventions have found that baseline stage of readiness to change is associated with outcome (Colby et al. 1998)
and because in this sample the stage of readiness to change
was associated with randomization group and outcomes of
interest.

## Results

### Preliminary Analyses

Data were collected from 220 individuals at baseline. Four
people were removed from the intervention group for administrative reasons (see Fig. 1). Of the 216, 44 (20%) did not
contribute any follow-up data at 3 months or 6 months and
were not included in the analyses. However, n = 141 contributed 3-month data, n = 157 contributed 6-month data, and n =
126 completed both follow-ups. For analytic purposes, the
baseline sample included individuals who contributed
follow-up data at either one or both of the follow-up points.
Thus, the analytic sample included n = 172 at baseline, n =
141 at 3 months, and n = 157 at 6 months (Fig. 1). We did not
observe differential patterns in loss to follow-up between the
two study groups (Supplementary Table 2). The n = 44 participants not followed were more likely to have reported dating
abuse victimization at baseline (82% vs. 65% of those followed) and more likely to have been recruited in the emergency
department (86% vs. 60%). For the analytic sample, all demographics were balanced between groups at baseline except
those in the intervention group were more likely to report
being in the “contemplation” stage of readiness to change
(Table 1).

### GEE Analyses

Overall Effects No intervention effect was observed for any,
physical, sexual, or psychological abuse in the genderunstratified main effects model that pools data from 3 and
6 months (Table 3). There was an overall effect on cyber abuse
(RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27, 0.87). There were also overall effects
for males for any abuse (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07, 0.55), physical abuse (0.30, 95% CI 0.10, 0.89), and cyber abuse (RR
0.04, 95% CI 0.01, 0.27) (Table 3).

Three Months Outcomes Differential intervention effects at 3
and 6 months, estimated through interaction models, are summarized in Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2, and parameter
estimates from these models are reported in Supplementary
Table 3. At 3 months, for all participants, no intervention
effect was observed for the any, physical, or sexual DA

perpetration categories (Table 3). However, there was an effect
on psychological DA perpetration and cyber DA perpetration
(Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 2). The relative risk of psychological DA perpetration at 3 months for the intervention
group, as compared with control group, given baseline perpetration, was RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.06, 0.93). The relative risk of
cyber DA perpetration at 3 months was RR 0.39 (95% CI
0.19, 0.79). At 3 months, the stratified analysis revealed that
the intervention was associated with a decrease in the category
of any DA perpetration for males RR 0.25 (95% CI 0.06,
0.97), but not females, and that the intervention was associated
with a medium-sized decrease in the category of cyber DA
perpetration for females adjRR 0.49 (95% CI 0.25, 1.00, p =
0.049) (Table 3). There were too few males to conduct analyses for males’ sexual, psychological, and cyber DA perpetration. The adjusted version of these analyses is presented in
Supplementary Table 3 and are virtually identical.


Six Months Outcomes At 6 months, there were no intervention
effects observed in the unstratified analysis or on females in
gender-stratified analysis (Table 3). However, there was a difference in the percentage of males who perpetrated any type of
DA by study group. At 6 months, the RR for any DA perpetration for males in the intervention group as compared with
the control group was RR 0.13 (95% CI 0.02, 1.01) (Table 3).
The adjusted analysis yielded an adjRR of 0.14 (95% CI 0.02,
0.97) (Supplementary Table 3).

## Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate any
positive effect of a one-session BI to reduce DA perpetration.
While the effects were modest and, for the whole sample,
limited to psychological and one specific form of cyber DA

abuse perpetration (i.e., breaking into a partner’s cell phone or
email), intervention effects were observed for the outcomes
any and physical DA perpetration for males specifically. The
findings represent a step forward for the field. With further
testing, and perhaps bolstering of the elements that produced
change, the intervention may prove to be one useful tool in the
array of evidence-based programs and interventions for adolescent health care settings. This one-session, brief intervention that can be delivered by non-clinicians is less resourceintensive than a multi-session group therapy or individual
cognitive behavior therapy. The intervention only takes 30–
45 min to deliver, and non-clinicians can be trained in approximately 20 h to become interventionists, so the relatively low
labor cost and resource investment is an advantage.
On the topic of BIs for substance use, the World Health
Organization has stated that “…brief interventions are not
intended as a stand-alone treatment for people who are dependent or at ‘high risk’” (Humeniuk 2010). BIs tend to generate
small effects that persist for only a few months (Platt et al.
2016; Saitz 2014), so the small and short-term effects of the
Real Talk intervention are not surprising. However, BIs have
been successful at improving participants’ readiness to accept
help for their behavioral problems and decrease a number of
risky behaviors in the short term, including HIV-related risk
behavior, alcohol and drug use–related risk behavior, and
gambling (Babor and Higgins-Biddle 2001; Bray et al.
2017; Celio and Lisman 2014). The Real Talk intervention


appears to have influenced selected DA outcomes and could
motivate high-risk adolescents to engage in other counseling
programs. For a discussion of reasons that youth in this sample
said they felt motivated to change their DA perpetration behavior, please see Blackburn et al. (2019).
Consistent with the vast majority of BI RCTs, we observed
a decrease in the target risk behavior in both the intervention
and control groups (Carter et al. 2016; Crane and Eckhardt
2013; Cunningham et al. 2012, 2013; Eckhardt et al. 2006;
Rhodes et al. 2015). There are several plausible explanations
for this. The control group could have been influenced by the
materials that they received at enrollment. However, it seems
unlikely that the pamphlet and palm-card were powerful
enough to effect change. Another possibility is that filling
out the data collection surveys was in itself a form of intervention, but prior tests of this type of survey reactivity in
partner violence research have found that it was not the cause
of behavior decreases in non-intervention groups (Rhodes
et al. 2015). It is possible that the participants in both groups
were unreliable reporters of their own behavior and underreported their perpetration behavior at follow-up, though they
had been honest at baseline. Finally, it is possible that DA
perpetration is a relatively low base rate behavior from which
people naturally desists without any intervention, particularly
if they change partners. This possibility, though, is at odds
with literature that finds that DA perpetrators tend to continue
to use aggression in their relationships (Knight et al. 2016).

Results are from longitudinal generalized estimating equations (GEEs) log-binomial regression that modeled the risk of DA perpetration. Separate
analyses were conducted for each type of DA perpetration. RR is the intervention RR, describing change in risk of perpetration in the Real Talk group
relative to the control group. RR less than 1.0 indicates that the risk of perpetration decreased in the Real Talk group relative to the control group

a Overall effects are based on main effect models pooling results from 3 and 6 months

b Effects at 3 and 6 months are from interaction models including multiplicative interaction terms between intervention and time that yield different
intervention effects at different times

c For any DA perpetration and physical DA perpetration models did not include baseline perpetration because 100% of respondents reported these
behaviors at baseline. Real Talk effects for these models are based on simple differences between intervention groups

d For sexual, psychological, and cyber DA models include baseline perpetration and Real Talk effects reflect differential change from baseline, based on
the interaction between intervention and time

e Cell sizes too small to conduct GEE analysis


The Real Talk intervention appeared to influence psychological abuse more than physical or sexual abuse. It has been
demonstrated that psychological DA victimization precedes
the acceptance of other forms of DA and poor mental health
in longitudinal studies of adolescents (Temple et al. 2016).
Not only does psychological DA have its own deleterious
effects on adolescents, it can be a precursor to more severe
forms of physical and sexual violence (Schumacher and
Leonard 2005). In general, psychological abuse and breaking
into a dating partner’s cell phone or email are more common
forms of DA than physical and sexual abuse, and there is a
subset of adolescents who engage only in these forms of abusive behaviors (Reidy et al. 2016). It may be that the psychological forms of DA that we assessed are less entrenched and
more amenable to change through this intervention. It may
also be that the content of the intervention was more useful
to participants in terms of changing their non-physical-contact


behaviors. Youth may have felt that they had more control
over whether or not they engaged in psychological DA perpetration as compared with physical DA, because physically
combative situations with partners may have escalated more
quickly and involved more mutuality (Taylor and Mumford
2016).
The Real Talk intervention was designed for youth of any
gender or sexual orientation. Because one of the principles of
MI is to use a supportive counseling style to “meet participants
where they are at,” flexibility is built into the content (Center
for Substance Abuse Treatment 1999). The intervention is
designed to be tailored, in the moment, to each individual
participant’s behavioral goals and safety concerns, so specific
versions of Real Talk for gender and/or sexual orientation
minority youth should not be necessary. More females than
males seek health care at the venues where we recruited patients, and more females expressed interest in being screened


-----

for eligibility for a study on relationships; thus, we had more
females enrolled in the study. The fact that we observed particular effects on males and on all participants, but not females, could mean that the opportunity to talk with a nonjudgmental adult about DA perpetration was particularly powerful for males, who may be more likely to lack such opportunities elsewhere. It may also mean that the males were either
more open to the idea of changing their behavior, or that they
had more efficacy to do so. There is some evidence to suggest
that females who perpetrate psychological DA are more likely
than males to lack self-control; they perpetrate impulsively,
which could be harder to correct, whereas males are more
likely to perpetrate psychological DA for specific reasons like
wanting to control their partners (Baker et al. 2018).
Notably, at baseline, almost two-thirds of the sample reported experiencing DA victimization in the preceding
3 months. Given that 66% of 12–18-year old youth in the
US report experiencing DA victimization at least once, it is
not entirely unexpected that the prevalence rate of victimization in this sample was as high as it was (Taylor and Mumford
2016). Because there is so much overlap between DA victimization and perpetration in adolescents, the MI style of intervention is a good choice for prevention because it is participant-centered, non-confrontational, and gentle. The clientdriven nature of the Real Talk MI-style intervention may be
particularly important given that so many youth both experience and use aggression in their dating relationships, and may
be recovering from trauma. The relative low-cost of training
non-clinician staff to deliver the Real Talk intervention in
health care settings, coupled with the prevalence of DA, is a
strong argument for continuing to evaluate its effects.

### Limitations

DA perpetration was self-reported and not verified with dating
partners or criminal records. Prior research suggests that both
males and females tend to underreport partner violence perpetration, and that males are slightly more likely to underreport
than females (Freeman et al. 2015). Consistent underreporting
of DA at each time point would not have influenced the results
of this RCT, though if underreporting became more or less
likely over time that might have attenuated or exaggerated
results. A second limitation was that this sample is not representative of all US youth. It is the strength of the study that the
sample was predominantly Black, Hispanic, and multi-racial
urban-residing youth, as the majority of existing DA research
has been conducted with White youth. However, there were
relatively few boys in this study because boys are less likely to
seek health care in this venue (Carroll et al. 2011) and thus are
less likely to be screened. Therefore, there is a need to replicate with a larger sample with a particular emphasis on the
recruitment of males. Attrition analyses indicate that participants lost to follow-up were more likely to have been recruited


from the outpatient setting instead of the emergency department, and to report DA victimization at baseline. Although
participant retention rates were on par with similar research
studies conducted in this same setting and with demographically similar populations (Bernstein et al. 2012; Walton et al.
2010), youth who were possibly at higher risk for aggression
were more likely to be lost to follow-up, and the direction of
the bias that this may have introduced is unknown. A final
limitation is that cyber abuse was measured through a sole
item. When the survey instrument was first drafted and the
psychometric properties were tested in 2010, the nuances of
cyber DA had not yet been fully explicated, and access to
smartphones was not widespread in the study population.
Increasingly, the ways in which the internet can be used to
cause harm have proliferated and an increasing number of
youth have access to smartphones and social media
(Marganski and Melander 2018). Thus, future tests of the
intervention should include multi-item measures of cyber
DA, of which there are now many (Brown and Hegarty
2018). Future tests might also test multi-session vs. single
sessions.

## Conclusions

This RCT study of a brief, motivational interview-style, intervention in an urban, hospital-based pediatric care setting
found small but positive effects for preventing psychological
and cyber DA perpetration. Further research to determine if
the effects can be increased, persist longer, and persist across
different implementation settings will be important for the
field.
