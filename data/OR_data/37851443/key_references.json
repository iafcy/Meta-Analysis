            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThe Caring for Children in the Community Study examined the prevalence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders and correlates of mental health service use in rural African American and white youth.\n## METHODS\nFour thousand five hundred youth aged 9 to 17 years from 4 North Carolina counties were randomly selected from school databases. Parents completed telephone questionnaires about their children's behavior problems. A second-stage sample of 1302 was identified for recruitment into the interview phase of the study, and 920 (70.7%) of these were successfully interviewed at home using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment and related measures of service use.\n## RESULTS\nWeighted back to general population estimates, 21.1% of youth had 1 or more DSM-IV psychiatric disorders in the past 3 months. Prevalence was similar in African American (20.5%) and white (21.9%) youth. The only ethnic difference was an excess of depressive disorders in white youth (4.6% vs 1.4%). Thirteen percent of participants (36.0% of those with a diagnosis) received mental health care in the past 3 months. White youth were more likely than African American youth to use specialty mental health services (6.1% vs 3.2%), but services provided by schools showed very little ethnic disparity (8.6% vs 9.2%). The effect of children's symptoms on their parents was the strongest correlate of specialty mental health care.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn this rural sample, African American and white youth were equally likely to have psychiatric disorders, but African Americans were less likely to use specialty mental health services. School services provided care to the largest number of youths of both ethnic groups.\n",

            "title": "Longitudinal mental health service and medication use for ADHD among Puerto Rican youth in two contexts.",
            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nThe study describes prevalence and rates of services and medication use and associated factors over time among Puerto Rican youths with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n## METHOD\nLongitudinal data are obtained on Puerto Rican children ages 5 through 13 years in the south Bronx in New York (n = 1,138) and two metropolitan areas in Puerto Rico (n = 1,353). The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-IV is the diagnostic tool. Five composite measures of risk factors: negative family influences, ineffective structuring, environmental risks, child risks, and maternal acceptance are constructed to relate services and medication use to risk variables.\n## RESULTS\nADHD prevalence is similar in Puerto Rico and the south Bronx. Overall mental health services, medication, and psychostimulant use is lower in Puerto Rico across three time points. Most participants never received treatment at any time point. More environmental risks, negative child traits, and low maternal warmth are associated with more services, even after adjusting for comorbidity. When risk variables are controlled, the effects of ADHD on services use decrease. Previous treatment is a strong predictor of subsequent treatment.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nRates of services and medication use are lower in Puerto Rico. Context seems to be more important than ethnicity in predicting mental health services and medication use among Puerto Rican children with ADHD. Other psychiatric diagnoses and general risk variables are important correlates of services and medication use.\n",

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nThis study describes the prevalence, adequacy and correlates of 12-month mental health service use among participants in the Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey.\n## METHODS\nThe authors conducted face-to-face household surveys of a probability sample of 3005 adolescents aged 12-17 years residing in the Mexico City metropolitan area during 2005. The prevalence of mental health disorders and the use of services were assessed with the computer-assisted adolescent version of the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Correlates of service use and adequate treatment were identified in logistic regression analyses that took into account the complex sample design and weighting process.\n## FINDINGS\nLess than one in seven respondents with psychiatric disorders used any mental health services during the previous year. Respondents with substance-use disorders reported the highest prevalence of service use and those with anxiety disorders the lowest. Approximately one in every two respondents receiving any services obtained treatment that could be considered minimally adequate.\n## CONCLUSION\nWe found large unmet needs for mental health services among adolescents with psychiatric disorders in Mexico City. Improvements in the mental health care of Mexican youth are urgently needed.\n## OBJECTIF\nLa pr\u00e9sente \u00e9tude d\u00e9crit la pr\u00e9valence, l\u2019ad\u00e9quation aux besoins et les corr\u00e9lats du recours aux services de sant\u00e9 mentale sur 12 mois chez les sujets de l\u2019Enqu\u00eate sur la sant\u00e9 mentale des adolescents de Mexico.\n## M\u00c9THODES\nLes auteurs ont men\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate en face-\u00e0-face dans les m\u00e9nages sur un \u00e9chantillon probabiliste de 3005 adolescents de 12 \u00e0 17 ans, r\u00e9sidant dans la zone m\u00e9tropolitaine de Mexico en 2005.

La prevalencia de trastornos de salud mental y el uso de los servicios correspondientes se evaluaron con la versi\u00f3n computadorizada para adolescentes de la Entrevista CIDI (Composite International Diagnostic Interview) sobre Salud Mental Mundial. Los factores correlacionados con la utilizaci\u00f3n de los servicios y el tratamiento adecuado se determinaron mediante an\u00e1lisis de regresi\u00f3n log\u00edstica adaptados al complejo proceso de dise\u00f1o y ponderaci\u00f3n de muestras.\n## RESULTADOS\nMenos de uno de cada siete encuestados con trastornos psiqui\u00e1tricos hab\u00edan usado alg\u00fan tipo de servicio de salud mental durante el a\u00f1o precedente. Los encuestados con trastornos de consumo de sustancias son los que declararon la m\u00e1xima prevalencia de uso de servicios, y la prevalencia m\u00e1s baja correspondi\u00f3 a los afectados por trastornos de ansiedad. Entre quienes usaron alg\u00fan tipo de servicio, alrededor de uno de cada dos encuestados recibieron un tratamiento m\u00ednimamente adecuado.\n## CONCLUSI\u00d3N\nSe han detectado importantes necesidades no atendidas de servicios de salud mental entre los adolescentes con trastornos psiqui\u00e1tricos de M\u00e9xico D.F. Es preciso mejorar urgentemente la atenci\u00f3n de salud mental de los j\u00f3venes mexicanos.\n## \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0636\n\u062a\u0648\u0636\u062d \u06d5\u0630\u06d5

            "abstract": "This study describes 4 help-seeking steps among children at high risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and identifies barriers to ADHD symptom detection and treatment. Using a district-wide stratified random sample of 1615 elementary school students screened for ADHD risk, predictors of 4 help-seeking steps among a high-risk group (n = 389) and parent-identified barriers to care among children with unmet need for ADHD care (n = 91) were assessed. Study findings indicate that although 88% of children were recognized as having a problem, only 39% had been evaluated, 32% received an ADHD diagnosis, and 23% received current treatment. Older children and those with more severe behavior problems were more likely to be perceived by their parents as having a problem. Additionally, gender and ethnic disparities in the subsequent help-seeking process emerged. Boys had over 5 times the odds than girls of receiving an evaluation, an ADHD diagnosis, and treatment. Compared to African American youth, Caucasian children had twice the odds of taking these help-seeking steps. For those children with unmet need for ADHD care, poverty predicted lower treatment rates and was associated with the most pervasive barriers. The gap between parental problem recognition and seeking services suggests that thresholds for parental recognition of a child behavior problem and for seeking ADHD services may be different. Future research examining the help-seeking process for ADHD should include a qualitative component to explore the potential mechanisms for gender and ethnic differences.\n",

            "abstract": "## PURPOSE\nThis study describes the perspectives of parents and adolescents regarding clinical need for and attitudes toward care for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In addition, it explores as to how these views relate to past year usage of mental health services.\n## METHODS\nParents and adolescents were interviewed 6 years after the school district was screened for ADHD. Using standardized measures, mental health service usage, adolescent and parent perceived clinical needs (ADHD symptoms, disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety and/or depression, functioning), and enabling attitudes (treatment receptivity, ADHD stigma), as well as parent factors (caregiver strain, distress, instrumental social support) were assessed. Nested logistic regression modeling was used to determine the hierarchical contribution of parent and adolescent perspectives on past year service usage, after adjusting for previous usage of mental health services. Stepwise regression was conducted to identify the variables that were most predictive of service usage.\n## RESULTS\nAmong the adolescents who were at a high risk for ADHD, 79% had a history of lifetime mental health service usage, but only 42% had received any kind of mental health services in the past year. In hierarchical modeling, only parent inattention ratings and medication receptivity and adolescent ADHD stigma perceptions contributed significantly toward improved model fit. Stepwise regression confirmed these three variables to be predictors (OR: 1.2, 3.8, and .2, respectively) and identified adolescents-reported functioning as an additional predictor of service usage (OR: 1.1).\n## CONCLUSION\nPerceptions of adolescents regarding the stigma related to ADHD are influential in treatment receipt. Quality improvement interventions for adolescents with ADHD should include psychoeducational interventions for adolescents and their parents that target medication receptivity and the stigma related to ADHD.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nFew prevalence studies in which DSM-IV criteria were used in children in representative community samples have been reported. We present prevalence data for the child and adolescent population of Puerto Rico and examine the relation of DSM-IV diagnoses to global impairment, demographic correlates, and service use in an island-wide representative sample.\n## METHODS\nWe sampled 1886 child-caretaker dyads in Puerto Rico by using a multistage sampling design. Children were aged 4 to 17 years. Response rate was 90.1%. Face-to-face interviews of children and their primary caretakers were performed by trained laypersons who administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, version IV (DISC-IV) in Spanish. Global impairment was measured by using the Children's Global Assessment Scale scored by the interviewer of the parent. Reports of service use were obtained by using the Service Assessment for Children and Adolescents.\n## RESULTS\nAlthough 19.8% of the sample met DSM-IV criteria without considering impairment, 16.4% of the population had 1 or more of the DSM-IV disorders when a measure of impairment specific to each diagnosis was considered. The overall prevalence was further reduced to 6.9% when a measure of global impairment was added to that definition. The most prevalent disorders were attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (8.0%) and oppositional defiant disorder (5.5%). Children in urban settings had higher rates than those in rural regions. Older age was related to higher rates of major depression and social phobia, and younger age was related to higher rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Both overall rates and rates of specific DSM-IV/DISC-IV disorders were related to service use. Children with impairment without diagnosis were more likely to use school services, whereas children with impairment with diagnosis were more likely to use the specialty mental health sector. Of those with both a diagnosis and global impairment, only half received services from any source.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBecause we used the DISC-IV to apply DSM-IV criteria, the study yielded prevalence rates that are generally comparable with those found in previous surveys. The inclusion of diagnosis-specific impairment criteria reduced rates slightly. When global impairment criteria were imposed, the rates were reduced by approximately half.\n",

Families were recruited from a pediatric patient list and 714 families participated in an initial study wherein they completed child anxiety questionnaires. According to parent and child self-report questionnaires (n=714), 22% and 20% of children, respectively, were above a suggested clinical cutoff on a brief anxiety screen; 19% and 14% of children exceeded clinical cutoffs on a separate social anxiety questionnaire. All families were invited to participate in a second study that included the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children-Parent Version and questions about treatment utilization; telephone interviews with 190 parents showed 1-year prevalence rates of DSM-IV child disorders to be 10.0% (se=2.2%) for specific phobia, 6.8% (se=1.8%) for social phobia, 3.2% (se=1.3%) for generalized anxiety disorder, 0.5% (se=.7%) for selective mutism, 1.6% (se=.9%) for major depressive disorder, 1.1% (se=.7%) for dysthymia, and 12.6% (se=2.4%) for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Among children with a current anxiety disorder, 31% had received counseling or medication treatment during their lifetime, compared to 40% of children with depression and 79% with ADHD. Adolescent age and being Caucasian were predictors of psychotherapy use; having an ADHD diagnosis was a predictor of both psychotherapy and medication use. The high prevalence of impairing anxiety disorders, in concert with the very low extent of treatment utilization, suggests a need for methods to identify and disseminate empirically validated treatments for these disorders in the primary care setting.\n",

Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine racial/ethnic differences in mental health care utilization.\n## RESULTS\nNine percent of parents reported that their child had ever used mental health care services; fewer black (6%) and Hispanic (8%) children had used services than white children (14%). Fewer black and Hispanic children with recent symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, and fewer black children with symptoms of depression had ever utilized services compared with white children. In multivariate analyses controlling for demographic factors, parental mental health, social support, and symptoms of the 4 mental health conditions, we found that black children were less likely than white children to have ever used services (Odds ratio [OR] 0.3, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.2-0.4, P < .001). The odds ratio for black children remained virtually unchanged when the analysis was restricted to children with symptoms of >/=1 mental health condition, and when the analysis was stratified by mental health condition. The difference in utilization for Hispanic compared with white children was fully explained by sociodemographics in all multivariate models.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDisparities exist in mental health care utilization for black and Hispanic children; the disparity for black children is independent of sociodemographics and child mental health need. Efforts to reduce this disparity may benefit from addressing not only access and diagnosis issues, but also parents' help-seeking preferences for mental health care for their children.\n",

Subgroups of subjects (n = 205, 84.7% of eligible subjects) were interviewed with a structured diagnostic schedule, and adolescents with major depression (n = 49), dysthymia (n = 21) and controls (n = 135) were compared.\n## RESULTS\nNearly 30% of controls had at least one current symptom of depression. Patterns of affective symptoms were similar in major depression and dysthymia, but significant differences emerged in comorbid conditions (more anxiety disorders, suicidal behaviors, and alcohol intoxications associated with major depression) and stressor at onset (more severe in major depression). Experiences of loss during the prior 12 months were associated with both forms of affective disorder, while poor family relationships were specific correlates of dysthymia. In contrast, peer relationships and pathological behaviors did not differ between depressed subjects and controls. Although psychosocial functioning was significantly impaired in both groups of depressed adolescents, treatment seeking was limited to 34.7% for major depressive subjects and 23.8% for dysthymic subjects.\n## CONCLUSION\nThe results provide evidence that major depression and dysthymia in adolescence are equally severe but may have distinct patterns in associated factors.

The at-risk teenagers and their parents were interviewed approximately 2 years after the initial screen to assess service use during the intervening period and identify barriers that may have interfered with seeking treatment.\n## RESULTS\nAt the time of the screening, 72% of the at-risk students were not receiving any type of mental health service. Of these students, 51% were deemed in need of services and subsequently referred by us to a mental health professional. Nearly 70% followed through with the screening's referral recommendations. The youths and their parents reported perceptions about mental health problems, specifically relating to the need for treatment, as the primary reasons for not seeking service.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nScreening seems to be effective in enhancing the likelihood that students at risk for suicidal behavior will get into treatment. Well-developed and systematic planning is needed to ensure that screening and referral services are coordinated so as to facilitate access for youths into timely treatment.\n",

We present methods and results from the first wave of the study, focusing on prevalence of disorders, associations with risk factors, and the use of services.\n## METHOD\nThe target population included all 9,430 children attending grades 2 to 4 in Bergen schools during the academic year 2002/2003. The main screening instrument was the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, whereas diagnoses were based on the Development and Well-Being Assessment. Information about child and family risk factors and service use was also obtained in this second stage.\n## RESULTS\nIn the first phase, the teacher Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was obtained for 9,155 (97%) of the target children and the matching parent Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for 6,297 (67%); 1,011 children (11%) were assessed with the Development and Well-Being Assessment in the second phase. The weighted prevalence for any DSM-IV psychiatric disorder was 7.0% (95% confidence interval 5.6%-8.5%). Disorders were associated with age, gender, learning difficulties, family type, and poverty. Although 75% of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder had been in contact with specialist mental health services, this was true for only 13% of those with pure emotional disorders.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe overall prevalence of psychiatric disorders in children is relatively low in this Norwegian sample, when assessed with the Development and Well-Being Assessment. Children with emotional disorders have limited access to specialist services.\n",

Youths aged 9 through 17 years and a parent/ caretaker were interviewed. Because the investigators had concerns about the capacities of the younger children in the study to describe their use of mental health services, more extensive questions were asked of parents than of youths.\n## RESULTS\nThe procedures developed by the MECA project identified patterns of service use that varied in the four communities surveyed. Agreement between reports of parents and youths regarding the use of mental health and substance abuse services showed substantial inconsistencies, similar to reports of psychiatric disorders. At three of the four sites, the majority of children meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder and scoring 60 or less on the Children's Global Assessment Scale reported some mental health-related service in the previous year, although at two of the sites fewer than 25% of these youths were seen in the mental health specialty sector.\n## CONCLUSION\nCommunity surveys show great promise for monitoring the need for mental health and substance abuse services and for identifying patterns of use.\n",

The modal treatment was outpatient, individual psychotherapy administered by a mental health provider. Inpatient treatment and medications were rare. Factors found to be related to treatment utilization were the severity of the depression, the existence of a comorbid nonaffective disorder, the number of previous episodes of depression, history of suicide attempt, academic problems, lack of intact family, and female gender.

Although Lebanon, a low-to-middle income country, has suffered from decades of war and political instability, the burden of psychiatric disorders among adolescents in Lebanon remains unclear. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among adolescents in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, and to study the correlates and treatment seeking behavior associated with these disorders.\n## METHODS\nThrough a multistage cluster sampling design, 510 adolescents, aged 11-17\u00a0years were recruited from a household sample in Beirut in 2012. Parents and adolescents completed a battery of self-reported questionnaires and interviews including the Development and Well-being Assessment (DAWBA), the Peer-Relations Questionnaire (PRQ), and a demographic/clinical information questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to study the correlates of psychiatric disorders.\n## RESULTS\nThe 30-day prevalence of psychiatric disorders was 26.1\u00a0%, with anxiety disorders (13.1\u00a0%) and ADHD (10.2\u00a0%) being the most prevalent disorders. Only 6\u00a0% of those with disorders reported seeking professional help. Parental marital status, not attending school, having a chronic medical condition, having a family history of psychiatric disorders, as well as propensity to bullying and to being victimized by peers emerged as correlates of having psychiatric disorders.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA clear treatment gap is evident with a high 30-day prevalence of psychiatric disorders among adolescents in Beirut coupled with a very low percentage seeking treatment. Scaling up mental health services and addressing potential barriers to seeking care would be important to close this gap.\n",

Despite the availability of evidence-based depression care, few teens receive it, even when recognized by primary care clinicians. Perceived barriers such as teen worry about what others think or parent concerns about cost and access to care may contribute to low rates of care. We sought to better understand perceived barriers and their impact on service use.\n## DESIGN\nAfter completing an eligibility and diagnostic telephone interview, all depressed teens and a matched sample of nondepressed teens recruited from 7 primary care practices were enrolled and completed telephone interviews at baseline and 6 months (August 2005-September 2006).\n## PARTICIPANTS\nThree hundred sixty-eight adolescent patients aged 13 to 17 (184 depressed and 184 nondepressed) and 338 of their parents.\n## MEASURES\nPerceived barriers to depression care and use of services for depression (psychotherapy and antidepressant medication).\n## RESULTS\nTeens with depression were significantly more likely to perceive barriers to care compared with nondepressed teens. Parents were less likely to report barriers than their teens; perceived stigma and concern about family member response were among the significant teen barriers. Teen perceived barriers scores were negatively associated with any use of antidepressants (P < 0.01), use of antidepressants for at least 1 month (P < 0.001), and any psychotherapy or antidepressant use (P < 0.05) at 6 months.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTo improve treatment for adolescent depression, interventions should address both teen and parent perceived barriers and primary care clinicians should elicit information from both adolescents and their parents.\n",

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nTo examine the relationship of depressive and disruptive disorders with patterns of mental health services utilization in a community sample of children and adolescents.\n## METHOD\nData were from the NIMH Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA) Study. The sample consisted of 1,285 child (ages 9-17 years) and parent/guardian pairs. Data included child psychopathology (assessed by the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children), impairment, child need and use of mental health services, and family socioeconomic status.\n## RESULTS\nAfter adjusting for potential confounding factors, disruptive disorder was significantly associated with children's use of mental health services, but depressive disorder was not. For school-based services, no difference was found between the 2 types of disorders. Parents perceived greater need for mental health services for children with disruptive disorders than for those with depression. Conversely, depression was more related to children's perception of mental health service need than was disruptive disorder.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe findings highlight the need for more effective ways to identify and refer depressed children to mental health professionals, the importance of improving school-based services to meet children's needs, and the necessity to better educate parents and teachers regarding the identification of psychiatric disorders, especially depression.\n",

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nThis study examined patterns of mental health service use among depressed children and adolescents and factors associated with help seeking and treatment modalities.\n## METHODS\nThe sample consisted of 206 children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years who were assessed as part of a larger survey of mental health service use in five service systems and in the community and who met DSM-III-R criteria for depressive disorders (major depression or dysthymia).\n## RESULTS\nAmong the 206 children, 75 (36 percent) never received professional help for depressive symptoms. Among the 131 children who received professional help for depression, antidepressants were prescribed for 40 (31 percent) in the year before the interview. The findings indicate possible undertreatment of depression among children and adolescents, especially among African Americans. Socioeconomic factors, such as the mother's education and the child's health insurance, were not associated with receiving professional help for depressive symptoms but were associated with receiving antidepressants. Parental perception of a child's mental health service need was associated with receiving professional help but not with receiving antidepressants. Also, depressed children were more likely to receive antidepressants when they had life-threatening or severe symptoms, such as a suicide attempt or drug abuse.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWhether a depressed child receives mental health services and the types of treatment received are influenced by different individual and family factors and by the type of symptoms exhibited. Better understanding of these factors will help in meeting the service needs of depressed children and adolescents.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nTo date, no one-phase survey of childhood depression has been performed in China that involves both urban and rural community children. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence, correlates, and mental health service utilization of depressive disorders (DDs) in a community-based sample of 6-14-year-old children in south-central China.\n## METHODS\nChildren (3,582) were approached through multistage sampling and interviewed using a Chinese version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents 5.0, which is a structured interview that is administered by trained psychiatrists to obtain information from children and their guardians.\n## RESULTS\nThe overall prevalence of all current DDs was found to be 2.8% (95%CI: 1.5-3.9). The risk factors for depression included being 9-14-year old, not attending school, having unmarried parents, living in a non-nuclear family (single parent or parentless family), being taken care of by people other than two parents (single parent, grandparent(s), other relatives, or others) during the past year, and not being breastfed prior to 1 year of age. Only 5.8% of the depressed children had received professional help prior to the interview.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe prevalence of DDs among children in this part of China is relatively high compared with most figures reported in other countries. Depression in this age group has been a major public health concern, but it is often underrecognized. There is an urgent need to develop efficacious interventions aimed at the prevention and early recognition of childhood depression.\n",

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nTo devise and test a model describing the process of help-seeking for child psychopathology in professional and informal service settings.\n## METHOD\nUsing structural equation modeling, associations between several help-seeking stages, and the influence of child, family, and context characteristics on these stages were investigated in 246 Dutch children (4-11 years old) between April 2000 and July 2002. Children were selected for having emotional or behavioral problems from a representative general practice sample; 68% of the selected children participated.\n## RESULTS\nSchool personnel played an important role in the process of help-seeking for child psychopathology, in both detecting service need and the provision of and the referral for help. Although Dutch general practitioners are supposed to be gatekeepers of mental health care, their role in help-seeking for child psychopathology was limited. Various family characteristics were shown to influence service need and informal or professional help-seeking. The influence of child characteristics on the help-seeking process was limited.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nEducating parents about child psychopathology and the availability and accessibility of care, improving general practitioners' skills in detecting child psychopathology, and direct contact of mental health professionals with general practitioners and schools may enhance access to care for children in need.\n",

            "abstract": "Depression has been increasing rapidly and is prevalent among youth. Inadequate mental health service utilization for youth and relevant racial/ethnic disparities are a growing concern. The current study used a nationally representative database to examine racial/ethnic disparities in youth depression prevalence, mental health services utilization, and psychotropic medication receipt. The sequential examination shows that depressed minority youth (22%-30%) were not only much less likely to use specialty mental health services than depressed Caucasian and multiracial youth (40%-43%, p < .001), they were also much less likely to receive psychotropic medications (22%-30%) than their Caucasian and multiracial counterparts (38%-44%, p = .048 to <.001) when using specialty mental health services. The findings reveal possibly two levels of racial/ethnic disparities at the decision points of accessing specialty mental health services and subsequent treatment methods choice. Implications for mental health policies and practices are also discussed.",
