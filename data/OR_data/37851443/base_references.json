            "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder in children, and the prevalence is increasing. Physicians should evaluate for ADHD in children with behavioral concerns (e.g., inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, oppositionality) or poor academic progress using validated assessment tools with observers from several settings (home, school, community) and self-observation, if possible. Physicians who inherit a patient with a previous ADHD diagnosis should review the diagnostic process, and current symptoms and treatment needs. Coexisting conditions (e.g., anxiety, learning, mood, or sleep disorders) should be identified and treated. Behavioral treatments are recommended for preschool-aged children and may be helpful at older ages. Effective behavioral therapies include parent training, classroom management, and peer interventions. Medications are recommended as first-line therapy for older children. Psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine, are most effective for the treatment of core ADHD symptoms and have generally acceptable adverse effect profiles. There are fewer supporting studies for atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine, and they are less effective than the psychostimulants. Height, weight, heart rate, blood pressure, symptoms, mood, and treatment adherence should be recorded at follow-up visits."

            "abstract": "Background: In the United States, the transition into adulthood begins in the late teens and continues through the mid-20s. This can be a stressful process be more difficult if young adults have a mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) or substance use disorder (SUD). Methods: This report uses combined data from the 2010 to 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). The NSDUH asks persons aged 12 to 17 about past year psychological symptoms to estimate if they had a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) in the past year. Adolescents were assessed as having MDE if they had a period of 2 weeks or longer during which there was either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, and at least four other symptoms that reflect a change in functioning, such as problems with sleep, eating, energy, concentration, and self-worth. Data are presented separately for adolescents aged 16 to 17 and young adults aged 18 to 25. Results: Combined 2010 to 2012 NSDUH data indicate that 1 in 10 older adolescents aged 16 to 17 had a MDE in the past year, while 18.7% young adults aged 18 to 25 had any mental illness (AMI) in the past year and 3.9% had a serious mental illness (SMI). In the past year, 3.1% of older adolescents had co-occurring MDE and SUD; 6.4% of young adults had co-occurring AMI and SUD, and 1.6% of young adults had co-occurring SMI and SUD. Among older adolescents with MDE, 60.1% did not receive treatment for depression in the past year. Among young adults with AMI, 66.6% did not receive mental health services in the past year. Among young adults with SMI, 47.0% did not receive treatment. Conclusion: The data in this report indicate that older adolescents with MDE are less likely than their peers without MDE to have the foundation needed to succeed as young adults. For example, compared with their peers without MDE, these youth were more likely to do poorly in school and to engage in delinquent behaviors. NSDUH data indicate that young adults with mental illness or co-occurring mental illness and SUD have poorer quality of life."

            "abstract": "Anxiety, depression and stress, often co-occurring, are the psychological problems for which university students most often seek help. Moreover there are many distressed students who cannot, or choose not to, access professional help. The present study evaluated the efficacy of an internet-based guided self-help program for moderate anxiety, depression and stress. The program was based on standard cognitive behavior therapy principles and included 5 core modules, some of which involved options for focusing on anxiety and/or depression and/or stress. Trained student coaches provided encouragement and advice about using the program via e-mail or brief weekly phone calls. Sixty-six distressed university students were randomly assigned to either Immediate Access or a 6-week Delayed Access condition. Sixty-one percent of Immediate Access participants completed all 5 core modules, and 80% of all participants completed the second assessment. On the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21, Immediate Access participants reported significantly greater reductions in depression (ηp(2)=. 07), anxiety (ηp(2)=. 08) and stress (ηp(2)=. 12) in comparison to participants waiting to do the program, and these improvements were maintained at a six month follow-up. The results suggest that the provision of individually-adaptable, internet-based, self-help programs can reduce psychological distress in university students."

Despite these difficulties adolescents with ADHD often demonstrate poor treatment compliance with traditional interventions (eg, psychostimulant medication). Virtual reality (VR) presents an innovative means of delivering engaging cognitive interventions for adolescents with ADHD and offers the potential to improve compliance with such interventions.

Participants will complete computerised assessments of inhibition and risk-taking preintervention and immediately postintervention. Parents/guardians will complete online questionnaires about their child's ADHD symptoms and social functioning at each of these timepoints. The primary outcome is change in inhibition performance in adolescents who received the intervention from preintervention to postintervention compared with adolescents in the control condition. Secondary outcomes include change in risk-taking, ADHD symptoms and social functioning in adolescents who received the intervention from preintervention to postintervention compared with adolescents in the control condition.

QoL is an important outcome measure in guiding healthcare and is held as a substantial parameter to evaluate the effectiveness of healthcare. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children might negatively influence the parents' QoL. Having a validated questionnaire to measure QoL for this population will therefore be a vital first step in guiding healthcare for parents of children with ADHD. We aimed to examine the reliability and validity of the Norwegian version of the MQLI in a sample of parents of children with ADHD. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 128 parents of children with ADHD were recruited from four outpatient clinics within the Child and Adolescents Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in Norway. They completed the MQLI along with an alternative well-being scale, the Five-item World Health Organization Well-being Index (WHO-5), and a form including demographic variables. Reliability and validity of the MQLI were examined. We conducted a factor analysis and calculated internal consistency and the correlation between the MQLI and the WHO-5. Results: Factor analysis of the parents reported MQLI yielded a one-factor solution. For the MQLI, Cronbach's alpha was 0.73. The correlation between the two measures of MQLI and WHO-5 was high (r = 0.84), reflecting convergent validity since the association between the two measures was strong. Conclusion: Results from this study support the reliability and validity of the Norwegian version of the MQLI for assessment of quality of life in parents of children with ADHD with good psychometric properties. Study findings support the use of the questionnaire in CAMHS."

Subjects who were over 18 and received a diagnosis of ADHD were included in the study. Chart review data of 102 subjects regarding demographics, medications, comorbidities, concomitant medications and domains of functional impairment were collected, and predictors were assessed using a binominal logistical regression model. One hundred and two patients (78.4 % male) with a mean age of 28.8 (SD = 9.8, range = 18-55) years were enrolled in the study. Childhood diagnosis of ADHD, agents used for treatment (MPH or atomoxetine), individual domains of dysfunction and use of additional psychotropic drugs were not found to be related to treatment adherence. Patients with a university education and those referred for family history of ADHD were more likely to adhere to treatment (p = 0.05 and 0.03, respectively). On the other hand, reasons for referral other than ADHD were significantly more frequently related to non-adherence (p = 0.02). Treatment noncompliance remains a significant problem despite therapeutic effects of medications. Identification of predictors of non-adherence can lead to heightened awareness of special populations at risk. We have found that prior awareness on ADHD (via past history/media/friends) leading to self/clinician referral to rule out ADHD and pervasiveness of symptoms across functional domains led to better compliance in our sample. Future research with prospective design utilizing objective tools for adherence is required."

The mechanism of action of fluoxetine; its metabolism; its efficacy in patients with various diagnostic subgroups of depression, patients with coincident medical disease, children and adolescents with depression, patients with eating disorders, and patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); its long-term (maintenance) efficacy; its side effects and toxicity; and pharmacoeconomic considerations are reviewed. Pharmacotherapy is currently the only proven method for treating major depressive disorder that is applicable to all levels of severity of major depressive illness. Since its introduction 10 years ago, fluoxetine has been available to psychiatrists, primary care physicians, and other nonpsychiatric physicians as full-dose effective pharmacotherapy for patients with depression. Fluoxetine has been widely prescribed by physicians knowledgeable in pharmacology and in the treatment of depression because of its proven efficacy (ie, equal to that of tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]), its ease of administration (with full therapeutic dosing usually starting from day 1), its generally benign side-effect profile, its remarkable safety in over-dose, and its proven effectiveness in the most common depressed patient population--anxious, agitated, depressed patients--as well as in patients with various subtypes and severities of depression. In more recent years it has also proved effective in the treatment of bulimia, an entity for which only limited or inadequate treatment options had been previously available. In OCD, fluoxetine, with its more acceptable side-effect profile and greater ease of dosing, presents a favorable alternative to previous drug therapy and is useful in treating both obsessions and compulsions. Fluoxetine is currently recognized among clinicians as efficacious in treating anxiety disorders and is being used successfully in special depressed populations such as patients with medical comorbidity, elderly patients, adolescents, and children. Rapid discontinuation or missed doses of short-half-life selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, TCAs, and heterocyclic antidepressants are associated with withdrawal symptoms of a somatic and psychological nature, which cannot only be disruptive, but can also be suggestive of relapse or recurrence of depression. In striking contrast to these short-half-life antidepressants, fluoxetine is rarely associated with such sequelae on sudden discontinuation or missed doses. This preventive effect against withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of fluoxetine is attributed to the unique extended half-life of this antidepressant. Current studies show that the overall increased effectiveness of fluoxetine in treating depression compensates for its higher cost, compared with older drugs, by reducing the need for physician contact because of increased compliance and less need of titration, and by reducing premature patient discontinuation, thereby yielding fewer relapses, less recurrence, and less reutilization of mental health services."

            "abstract": "Nonadherence in children who use long-term medication is a serious problem and assessing adherence is an important step to provide solutions to this problem. Medication adherence can be measured by several methods, including (a) self-report questionnaires or structured interviews, (b) therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), (c) electronic devices, and (d) pick-up/refill rates. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the literature about methods for the measurement of medication adherence in chronically ill children and adolescents. Therefore, we conducted a literature search by using multiple databases. Four methods of monitoring medication adherence are presented for the most described chronic diseases: asthma, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus and ADHD. First, 10 commonly used self-report questionnaires and structured interviews are described, including the main characteristics, (dis)advantages and their validation studies. Second, the use of TDM in pediatric trials for medication adherence measurement is discussed. New sampling methods (e.g. dried blood spot) and sampling matrices (e.g. hair, saliva and urine) have shown their benefits for TDM in children. Third, electronic devices to measure medication adherence in children are presented, being developed for several drug administration routes. Fourth, the analyses, advantages and disadvantages of pharmacy data are discussed. The usage of this data requires specific calculations and interpretations to assess adherence. As presented in this review, every adherence method has specific (dis)advantages. When deciding which adherence method is applicable, validity and generalizability should be taken into account. Combining multiple methods seems to offer the best solution in the daily clinical practice."

Regarding medication use, youth described 1) benefits, 2) changes in sense of self, 3) adverse effects, and 4) desire to discontinue use. Parents' beliefs were more homogeneous than youth beliefs, describing ADHD as a disorder requiring treatment. Most parents noted benefits from stimulant use. Themes were 1) medication as a last resort, 2) allowing the child to reach his or her potential; and 3) concerns about adverse and long-term effects. Families described how responsibility for treatment decisions is transferred from parent to adolescent over time.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Young adolescents can have different beliefs about ADHD and attitudes about medication use from their parents.

In the present study, we describe the implementation of a cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBI) to address grade 5 children's anxiety symptoms. The CBI arose from a long-standing partnership between University and Education Department stakeholders. The partnership integrates school-based, evidence-informed treatment delivery with clinical education, and also supports a school-based psychology clinic to provide assessment and treatment services to children attending schools within the catchment area and clinical training for university graduate students. Children in the active condition (N=74) completed the CBI during regular class time, while children in the control condition (N=77) received the standard classroom curriculum. Children's anxiety and depressive symptoms, threat interpretation biases (perceived danger and coping ability), and perceptions of their social skills were assessed before and after condition. Children in the active condition reported significant improvements in self-reported anxiety symptoms, and perceptions of their social skills and coping ability, whereas no significant differences were observed for children in the control condition from pre- to post-assessment. For a subset of children assessed 12 months after the CBI (n=76), symptom improvement remained stable over time and estimates of danger and coping ability showed even greater improvement. Results demonstrate the value of strong stakeholder partnerships in innovative youth mental health services, positive child outcomes, and clinical education."

This review aimed to identify the factors affecting the three phases of medication adherence in people with ADHD. Methods: Six electronic databases, including Medline, PubMed, IPA, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycINFO, were systematically searched from inception through October 2018 with the limitations of English language and human studies. The search strategy was based on three concepts (adherence, ADHD, and factors) and their relevant terminologies. Results: Considerable variability was observed with regards to the criteria used to define adherence in identified studies (n = 48). Most studies focused on the implementation phase of adherence (n = 27), while only a handful focused on the initiation (n = 6) and discontinuation (n = 5) phase of adherence. The remaining studies (n = 10) examined multiple phases of adherence. Conflicting information received about medication, medication frequency, and fears of medication's effect on growth were the unique factors impacting initiation, implementation, and discontinuation, respectively. Moreover, factors within each phase of adherence also differed with different populations such as parents, children, adolescents, and adults. Fear of addiction, medication effectiveness, psychiatric comorbidity, and medication side effects were the most common factors identified in all three phases of adherence. Conclusions: This review found some unique factors in each phase of adherence while some overlap was also noted. Future interventions to improve adherence should be phase- and group specific rather than consider adherence as a single variable."

Referring to our previous 2005 review, improved up-to-date data for the enlarged EU on a broader range of disorders than previously covered are needed for basic, clinical and public health research and policy decisions and to inform about the estimated number of persons affected in the EU.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Stepwise multi-method approach, consisting of systematic literature reviews, reanalyses of existing data sets, national surveys and expert consultations. Studies and data from all member states of the European Union (EU-27) plus Switzerland, Iceland and Norway were included. Supplementary information about neurological disorders is provided, although methodological constraints prohibited the derivation of overall prevalence estimates for mental and neurological disorders. Disease burden was measured by disability adjusted life years (DALY).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Prevalence: It is estimated that each year 38.2% of the EU population suffers from a mental disorder. Adjusted for age and comorbidity, this corresponds to 164.8million persons affected. Compared to 2005 (27.4%) this higher estimate is entirely due to the inclusion of 14 new disorders also covering childhood/adolescence as well as the elderly. The estimated higher number of persons affected (2011: 165m vs. 2005: 82m) is due to coverage of childhood and old age populations, new disorders and of new EU membership states. The most frequent disorders are anxiety disorders (14.0%), insomnia (7.0%), major depression (6.9%), somatoform (6.3%), alcohol and drug dependence (>4%), ADHD (5%) in the young, and dementia (1-30%, depending on age). Except for substance use disorders and mental retardation, there were no substantial cultural or country variations. Although many sources, including national health insurance programs, reveal increases in sick leave, early retirement and treatment rates due to mental disorders, rates in the community have not increased with a few exceptions (i.e. dementia). There were also no consistent indications of improvements with regard to low treatment rates, delayed treatment provision and grossly inadequate treatment. Disability: Disorders of the brain and mental disorders in particular, contribute 26.6% of the total all cause burden, thus a greater proportion as compared to other regions of the world. The rank order of the most disabling diseases differs markedly by gender and age group; overall, the four most disabling single conditions were: depression, dementias, alcohol use disorders and stroke.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In every year over a third of the total EU population suffers from mental disorders. The true size of \"disorders of the brain\" including neurological disorders is even considerably larger. Disorders of the brain are the largest contributor to the all cause morbidity burden as measured by DALY in the EU. No indications for increasing overall rates of mental disorders were found nor of improved care and treatment since 2005; less than one third of all cases receive any treatment, suggesting a considerable level of unmet needs. We conclude that the true size and burden of disorders of the brain in the EU was significantly underestimated in the past. Concerted priority action is needed at all levels, including substantially increased funding for basic, clinical and public health research in order to identify better strategies for improved prevention and treatment for disorders of the brain as the core health challenge of the 21st century."

Adolescents were invited to fill in an online questionnaire containing questions on sociodemographics, health status, illness perceptions, medication adherence, and medication beliefs.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We invited 1,200 adolescents of whom 181 adolescents (122 males, mean age 14.2 ± 1.7 years) completed the online questionnaire. They mostly used methylphenidate (n = 167; 92%) as a pharmacological treatment for ADHD. Half of the study population (n = 93; 51%) experienced side effects, such as decreased appetite and sleep problems. Most participants (n = 150; 83%) had an indifferent attitude (perceived low necessity and low concerns) toward their ADHD medication. More than half of the study population (n = 111; 61%) reported to be nonadherent based on the Medication Adherence Report Scale. The highest score of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire was on \"treatment control,\" suggesting that adolescents do think their medication is effective, despite their indifferent drug attitude.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Most adolescents using ADHD medication had an indifferent attitude toward their medication and reported low adherence rates. These findings should be taken into account when treating adolescents with ADHD; regular counseling and monitoring of the pharmacological treatment might be useful to optimize treatment."

ACT score was high and depression was low in patients with good treatment compliance. As the age of the first asthma symptoms/diagnosis increased, somatization, anxiety, hostility and general psychopathology scores increased, as did the somatization score of parents. Parental anxiety score was not related with adolescent BSI scores in the controls but in the study group when it was higher, the anxiety, depression, somatization, and general psychopathology scores were higher. PAQLQ showed that anxiety, negative self-esteem, somatization, depression, and general psychopathology were higher in patients concerned about asthma. Depression and somatization scores were higher in the parents of patients who perceived that \"Treatment does not contribute to asthma control.\" Somatization scores were higher among parents of patients who noted: \"Asthma will not pass in the long-term\" and \"I cannot control asthma.\"\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Higher scores of asthma patients who were anxious about the disease and families who were despondent about treatment demonstrate that health care providers should spend more time informing patients and caregivers. Increasing patient treatment compliance during early adolescence will lessen the psychological burden of the disease."

Main outcome measures were reported adherence to practices specified in the AAP guidelines; ADHD practice patterns; and other measures, including attitudes about parent, teacher, and community influences on ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess patient and physician factors associated with adherence to guideline components.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The overall response rate was 60%. The majority (77.4%) of primary care physicians were familiar with AAP guidelines on ADHD, and many (61.1%) reported incorporating the guidelines into their practice. Differences were apparent by specialty: 91.5% of pediatricians were familiar with the guidelines in contrast to 59.8% of family physicians. The majority of clinicians reported practices consistent with individual components of the diagnostic and treatment guidelines. However, when adherence to multiple components was analyzed together, only 25.8% of clinicians reported routine use of all 4 diagnostic components in the survey. In addition, some physicians continue to use diagnostic modalities that are currently not recommended for routine evaluation of school-aged children with ADHD--continuous performance testing, neuroimaging, and laboratory tests (eg, thyroid, lead, or iron testing). With regard to ADHD treatment, the majority (66.6%) of respondents reported routine recommendation of pharmacotherapy and titration of medications in the first month when prescribed (81.3%). However, just over half (53.1%) reported routine follow-up visits (3-4 times per year) for children who have ADHD and are taking medications. Most (53.4%) clinicians also recommended behavioral therapy for children who had a diagnosis of ADHD. Patterns of specialty differences were less consistent for treatment components: pediatricians were more likely to recommend medications, but family physicians reported more frequent follow-up evaluations for children who receive medications. There were no specialty differences in recommendations for behavioral therapy. In addition to physician specialty variations, differences in management were apparent by practice type and other demographic characteristics. There were few significant associations between adherence to guideline components and physician attitudes about parent, teacher, or community influences. However, these factors were noted by many respondents. Only 32.5% agreed that their community had adequate, accessible mental health resources. Half (50.1%) of the physicians reported that insurers limit coverage for assessment and treatment of ADHD.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Primary care physicians generally report awareness of pediatric ADHD guidelines and follow these clinical practice recommendations.

To do so, the report uses two tasks that assess implicit bias to negative-valence faces, the first by eye-gaze and the second by measuring body-movement parameters. The report contrasts task performance in 51 treatment-seeking, medication-free pediatric patients with anxiety disorders and 36 healthy peers. Among these youth, 53 completed an eye-gaze task, 74 completed a body-movement task, and 40 completed both tasks. On the eye-gaze task, patients displayed longer gaze duration on negative relative to non-negative valence faces than healthy peers, F(1, 174) = 8.27, p = .005. In contrast, on the body-movement task, patients displayed a greater tendency to behaviorally avoid negative-valence faces than healthy peers, F(1, 72) = 4.68, p = .033. Finally, implicit bias measures on the two tasks were correlated, r(38) = .31, p = .049. In sum, we found an association between pediatric anxiety disorders and implicit threat bias on two tasks, one measuring eye-gaze and the other measuring whole-body movements. Converging evidence for implicit threat bias encourages future research using multiple tasks in anxiety."

Despite convincing data on effectiveness, engagement to BPT, particularly for high-risk families, has been a long standing, yet understudied, issue. Data from a clinical trial of a comprehensive BPT approach to enhance engagement and outcomes (the Strategies to Enhance Positive Parenting [STEPP] program) are presented herein. The STEPP program was compared to a traditional group-based BPT program on propensity to attend treatment, propensity to complete homework over the course of treatment, and dropout from BPT. Additionally, factors empirically related to engagement to treatment and targeted by the STEPP program were analyzed to determine whether these factors were enhanced by participation in the STEPP program. In a randomized cohort of 80 single-mothers of school-age children with ADHD, analyses demonstrated that the STEPP program lead to greater propensity to attend treatment over time and a greater propensity to complete homework over the course of treatment. Furthermore, participation in the STEPP Program was associated with a lower rate of dropout. Finally, data suggested that parents assigned to the STEPP program reported significant improvements in factors empirically related to engagement that were targeted within the STEPP program (i.e., amount and quality of social support from their group members, expectations for treatment, and perceived barriers to treatment participation). Results of the study have implications for targeting engagement throughout the process of BPT, particularly for high-risk families."

            "abstract": "This preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the feasibility of dismantling cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for childhood anxiety disorders. Fourteen children (10 girls) ages 7 to 14 (m = 10.2) with social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, or panic disorder were randomized to receive 6 sessions of either a) the pre-exposure anxiety management strategies presented in traditional CBT, or b) parent-coached exposure therapy. The sample was selected from a treatment seeking population and is representative of children in clinical settings. Examination of fidelity ratings, dropouts, and satisfaction ratings indicated that the interventions were distinguishable, safe, and tolerable. The overall sample improved significantly with pre-post effect sizes generally in the large range for both conditions. Between-group effect sizes indicating greater improvement with parent-coached exposure therapy were moderate or large for ten of 12 variables (i.e., 0.53 to 1.52). Re-evaluation after three months of open treatment suggested that the intervention emphasizing exposure early maintained its superiority while requiring fewer appointments."

            "abstract": "Advances in HIV treatment through highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have led to a steady decline in HIV-related mortality rates. However, HAART requires adherence to strict and often complicated medication regimens, and nonadherence to HAART can significantly decrease its effectiveness. Depression has consistently shown a robust association with medication nonadherence; consequently, numerous psychological interventions have been developed to target depression and increase medication adherence among HIV-infected individuals. The length of these interventions, however, may be prohibitive for certain HIV-infected populations, such as patients in rural areas. Therefore, this study provides an initial investigation of a one-session behavioral activation treatment for depression designed specifically for HIV-infected patients (BATD-HIV) at a community infectious disease clinic serving a largely rural population. In this initial uncontrolled open trial, BATD-HIV was administered to 10 HIV-infected patients with elevated symptoms of depression following their clinic appointment. Depression, anxiety, and stress symptom severity; behavioral activation processes; medication adherence; and CD4 T-cell count were assessed pre- and 1 month postintervention. Participants exhibited significant reductions in anxiety symptom severity and avoidance of negative aversive states and rumination from pre- to 1 month posttreatment. Although nonsignificant, participants also showed medium effect size reductions in depression and stress symptoms and work/school and social impairment, and medium effect size improvements in medication adherence and CD4 T-cell counts. Despite the preliminary nature of this study, results suggest that BATD-HIV may have utility as a brief treatment for HIV-infected patients with depression and warrants further investigation in larger scale randomized controlled trials."

Using the World Health Organization World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (Adolescent Version), we estimated the prevalence, severity, and disability of IED in a national, probability sample of African American and Caribbean Black youth (ages 13–17) from the National Survey of American Life, Adolescent Supplement. Face-to-face surveys of 810 African American and 360 Caribbean Black youth were conducted between 2001 and 2003. We calculated lifetime and 12-month diagnoses of IED using diagnostic algorithms based on DSM–IV and assessed IED disability using a modified Sheehan Disability Scale. Overall findings indicated lifetime and 12-month IED prevalence rates of 9.2% and 7.0%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence rates of IED were 9.0% for African American and 12.4% for Caribbean Black teens. Within the past 12 months, 6.7% of African American and 11.5% of Caribbean Black adolescents met diagnostic criteria for IED. Lifetime and 12-month IED were associated with anxiety disorders. In addition, few teens with lifetime IED received any treatment. Findings are consistent with recent evidence that intermittent explosive disorder may be more common than previously considered, especially among adolescents. Significant acts of aggression and impairment are associated with IED, and low treatment rates indicate that more research on this disorder and intervention options is warranted."

Children's treatment history influenced parents' perceptions of pharmacotherapy, with parents of children with no treatment history perceiving medication treatment as less acceptable and believable than parents of children with a history of medication alone or in combination with behavior therapy. No effect of treatment history was found for perceptions of CBT. Significant positive correlations emerged between parents' perceived acceptance and believability for pharmacotherapy and child age and level of dysfunction due to their child's anxiety, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to track trends in mental health symptoms, use of services, and unmet need for services among US adults, and to delineate variation across demographic strata. Data were drawn from the 2020 US Household Pulse Survey from repeated cross-sectional online surveys collected between April 23 and November 23, 2020 from 1,302,455 US adults, weighted to represent the US population. Survey respondents self-reported their symptoms of anxiety and depression, use of medication and counseling services, and unmet need for services. Reports of probable anxiety and depression rose significantly through the study period, to prevalence rates of 37% and 29%, respectively, by November, 2020, rates more than four times higher than early 2019 US norms. Use of prescription medication, counseling services, and unmet need for mental health services also rose significantly. Prevalence rates of probable mental health disorders were highest among young, less educated, single parent, female, Black and multi-racial respondents, with some vacillation in such disparities over cohorts. Young, female, and moderately educated respondents also reported higher unmet needs for services. Disparities in estimates of mental health disorders and mental health treatment indicate a striking disequilibrium between the potential need for and the use of mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising mental health challenges are being borne largely by young, less advantaged people of color and women, with the potential for expanded interruptions to optimal functioning and societal recovery from COVID-19."

We have also provided a brief review of the current gross inadequacies in access and quality of care available in Canada.

Negative affectivity had expected direct positive effects on all of the specific anxiety and depression manifestations, with the exception of health anxiety, which showed a negative relationship, and OCD symptoms, which showed no relationship. Positive affectivity was found to be a specific risk factor for depression, while intolerance of uncertainty was found to be a specific risk factor for worry and depression.

Any use (referent: nonuse) at 18 years of age was associated with lower odds of sexually transmitted infections among females (AOR: .39, 95% CI: .19-.83), pregnancies (AOR: .26, 95% CI: .13-.50), emergency department visits (AOR: .69, 95% CI: .55-.85), and greater odds of injuries (AOR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.02-1.32). Adherence at 19 years of age was associated with lower odds of pregnancy (AOR: .13, 95% CI: .02-.95). Any use at 19 years of age was associated with lower odds of injury in females (AOR: .77, 95% CI: .60-.99) pregnancy (AOR: .35, 95% CI: .16-.78), and, in both sexes, substance use (AOR: .71, 95% CI: .55-.92).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Late adolescence is associated with decline in ADHD medication use and adherence.

            "title": "Assessing Changes in Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety During Four Weeks of Cannabis Abstinence Among Adolescents.",
            "abstract": "Background: Cannabis use is prevalent among adolescents, and many report using in attempts to alleviate negative mood and anxiety. Abstinence from substances such as alcohol and tobacco has been reported to improve symptoms of anxiety and depression. Few studies have examined the effect of cannabis abstinence on symptoms of anxiety and depression. Objective: To test the effect of 4 weeks of continuous cannabis abstinence on depressive and anxious symptoms. Methods: Healthy, non-treatment seeking adolescents who used cannabis at least weekly (n = 179) were randomized to either 4 weeks of cannabis abstinence achieved through a contingency management paradigm (CB-Abst) or cannabis use monitoring without an abstinence requirement (CB-Mon). Abstinence was assessed by self-report verified with quantitative assay of urine for cannabinoids. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed weekly with the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ). Results: Symptoms of depression and anxiety decreased throughout the study for all participants (MASQ-AA: stnd beta = -0.08, p = 0.01, MASQ-GDA: stnd beta = -0.11, p = 0.003, MASQ-GDD: stnd beta = -0.08, p = 0.02) and did not differ significantly between randomization groups (p's > 0.46). Exploratory analyses revealed a trend that abstinence may be associated with greater improvement in symptoms of anxiety and depression among those using cannabis to cope with negative affect and those with potentially hazardous levels of cannabis use. Conclusions: Among adolescents who use cannabis at least weekly, 4 weeks of cannabis abstinence was not associated with a significant change in anxiety or depressive symptoms compared to continued use. For recreational cannabis users who may be concerned about reducing their use for fear of increased symptoms of anxiety and depression, findings suggest that significant symptom worsening may not occur within the first 4 weeks of abstinence. Further studies are needed in clinical populations where anxiety and depression symptoms are measured more frequently and for a longer period of abstinence. Future studies are also needed to determine whether there are subgroups of adolescents who are uniquely impacted by sustained cannabis abstinence."

However, teachers, social workers and a helpline were less likely to be considered as helpful. With regard to medications, vitamins received more positive views than psychotropics. Some interventions were frequently rated as likely to be helpful, whereas for others there was a lack of knowledge about their effectiveness. A positive finding is that alcohol and tobacco consumption were seen as harmful. When asked about mental health first aid strategies, participants supported the value of listening to the person in the vignette and advising professional help, but some unhelpful strategies were commonly endorsed as well.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Deficits were found in some aspects of depression literacy in Portuguese youth.

            "abstract": "Objective: Mental health treatment today incorporates neurobiology, genetics, neuro-imaging, and pharmacologic mechanisms, offering more options to patients. For some, these modern approaches are not viable choices due to reasons such as limited access to care, cost, intolerable side effects, and, in the pediatric population, fears of potential long-term effects. With the growing prevalence of chronic health conditions, concerns for age of onset, (McGorry, Purcell, Goldstone, & Amminger, 2011) and a growing population of mental health patients, cost-effective and evidence-based treatment options should be evaluated. Integrative treatments, also known as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), may offer interventions that meet today's clinical needs. Method: To evaluate evidence-based treatment options, we initiated the school-based integrative health program (IHP) in January 2011 at three high schools located in Massachusetts. Our goal was two-fold: first, to design a holistic treatment program and evaluate several integrative modalities, and; second, to determine the feasibility of providing a CAM health program through school clinics. Our protocol utilized three integrative treatments that addressed stress and anxiety conditions. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness affecting over 40 million adults in the US (Anxiety and Depression Association of America). Results: The program has been successfully implemented. Preliminary results indicate that this intervention decreased anxiety in these youth. Conclusion: Providing integrative techniques to students in the school setting has the potential to decrease barriers to accessing care, lowering treatment costs and decreasing school absenteeism by instituting care on-site. Offering a holistic approach to treatment in schools is feasible. Because utilizing these approaches involves their active participation, adolescents can acquire life-long skills that improve their ability to cope and confront inevitable life stressors."

The global pandemic has taken an enormous toll on the mental health and well-being of youth and their families and has exacerbated preexisting needs.2 The rapid expansion of telehealth capacity, providing services via text, telephone, or video, has provided access to a spectrum of services for individuals and expert consultation for partners in low-resource communities. Telehealth has demonstrated effectiveness for lowering the barriers to seeking treatment in rural communities for youth with suicidality, depression, and anxiety.3 However, disenfranchised, low-income populations lacking sufficient in-person care or internet broadband to support telepsychiatry services or who encounter other barriers, such as underinsurance or no insurance and limited cultural and linguistic matched services, continue to have poor access to care and are at risk for disparate outcomes.4 In the midst of a pandemic and an accelerated child and adolescent mental health emergency in the United States, disparities in access to services presents a crisis within a crisis.

Racial/ethnic minority youths face greater risks for developing anxiety and depression and experience higher burden as they are less likely to receive adequate mental health services for these conditions or to have their needs met. Further, standard evidence-based interventions for youth anxiety and depression may show diminished effects with racial/ethnic minority youths and with families of lower socioeconomic status. While community-level interventions to combat structural racism and reduce population-level risk are sorely needed, many youths will continue to require acute treatment services for anxiety and depression and interventionists must understand how to bring equity to the forefront of care. In this review, we adopt a health system framework to examine racial/ethnic disparities in system-, intervention-, provider-, and patient-level factors for psychosocial treatment of pediatric anxiety and depression. Current evidence on disparities in access and in efficacy of psychosocial intervention for anxious and depressed youths is summarized, and we use our work in primary care as a case example of adapting an intervention to mitigate disparities and increase equity.

Objective: This study proposed to analyze depression's incidence in children with JIA. We also monitored the evolution of depression with the improvement of the disease under treatment. Material and methods: We followed 145 patients suffering from JIA according to ILAR and Edmonton classification in 2001. The study was conducted over three years between 2015 and 2017. The assessment of depression was made using the Hamilton scale adapted for children by us. This scale consists of 11 fields with multiple questions, the evaluation was made by counting the score. The scale assesses overall depression intensity. It has a maximum score of 28 points, and one with eight points defines depression. Results: The results obtained using the Hamilton scale showed that, from the total of 145 patients suffering from JIA, 35 (24%) experienced mild depression, 10 (7%) moderate depression and 26 were borderline; 74 children did not experience the depressive syndrome. In the control group, depression was found in only 5% of subjects. After administering the most appropriate treatment, symptoms of depression have been improved and the depression score has decreased. Conclusion: The Hamilton questionnaire adapted for children is easy to apply and it is an important tool for assessing depression. Depression has been present in one-third of patients with JIA selected for this study. The symptoms of depression have been correlated with disease activity. Depression does not influence the disease, but the disease induces depression."

IU has been conceptualized as a vulnerability factor for excessive worry and anxiety, but the historical absence of a supported measure of IU in young children has hampered longitudinal research needed to evaluate temporal relationships between IU and anxiety and the differential developmental pathways of IU leading to different anxiety disorders and depression. The present study evaluated the psychometric properties of a newly developed 17-item parent-report measure of younger children's Responses to Uncertainty and Low Environmental Structure (i.e., the RULES questionnaire). We examined the preliminary structure, reliability, and validity of the RULES within a treatment-seeking sample of children aged 3-10 (N=160) with anxiety. Findings from an exploratory factor analysis supported a one-factor model that retained all 17 items. The RULES demonstrated strong internal consistency, and predictive, convergent, and divergent validity. In this early childhood sample, the RULES also showed stronger associations with anxiety than did a previously supported measure of IU developed for older youth, and showed preliminary sensitivity to treatment-related change. Findings provide preliminary psychometric support for the RULES as a parent-report measure of children's responses to uncertainty and low environmental structure that may inform etiologic models of anxiety."

One thousand one hundred and three children participated in the study, mean age 14 years (sd 0.35 years), and the prevalence of high dental anxiety was 7.1 percent (95 percent CI = 5.6 percent, 8.6 percent). In examining the hypothesis that anxious children are more likely to have 'cleaner' mouths in an attempt to avoid future dental treatment, it was found that children with high dental anxiety or general fear had similar overall oral cleanliness (mean debris score and CPITN) to their contemporaries. However, dentally anxious children have less contact with the dental team; that is, they were more likely to defer or cancel dental appointments. Gender and social class were more significant variables in the presence and absence of disease with regard to CPITN than were either dental or general anxiety. It is concluded that no difference could be detected regarding the periodontal treatment needs between those children who have or have not a self reported high dental anxiety. In addition the periodontal needs of the majority of this age-group (64 percent) and those with high dental anxiety (74 percent) can be treated with simple non-invasive dental procedures, which can be carried outside the context of a dental surgery."

This review aims to identify preventive post settlement influences, including living arrangements, access to mental health services, and effective treatments that may improve mental health outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic literature review was conducted of published papers in any language for children (<18 years) entering a host country, unaccompanied and seeking asylum. Specific studies were eligible if they examined any treatment or nontreatment influences on mental health or psychological resilience for the URM. Thirteen published quantitative studies were identified.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      URMs in more supportive living arrangements including foster care had lower risk of PTSD and lower depressive symptoms compared with those in semi-independent care arrangements. URMs living in reception settings that restricted freedom had more anxiety symptoms. Regarding help seeking, one study found only 30% of URMs had foster parents or guardians who could detect a mental health need. Two papers found the URMs had low levels of contact with mental health services despite the high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms. URMs were less likely than accompanied children to receive trauma-focused interventions, cognitive therapy, or even practical assistance with basic social needs. With regard to treatment evaluation, only case series were identified. Three studies found cognitive behavioural therapy improved PTSD symptoms and mental health outcomes. A less structured approach (mental health counselling alone) did not improve functional health outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Higher support living arrangements with low restrictions are associated with lower psychological distress. Most URMs are not receiving psychological interventions, and there is a dearth of studies evaluating treatment effectiveness for this group. There is an urgent need for more research to investigate pathways to mental health services and treatment efficacy in this vulnerable group."

            "abstract": "The United States is in the midst of a children's mental health crisis, with rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide increasing precipitously. Evidence produced by children's mental health services research can help address this crisis by informing public policy decisions about service delivery, system design, and investments in the social determinants of mental health. Unfortunately, the policy impact of children's mental health services research is limited because evidence often fails to reach policy makers, be responsive to their needs, resonate with their worldview, or reflect the contexts in which they make decisions. Dissemination strategies-defined as the development and targeted distribution of messages and materials about research evidence pertaining to a specific issue or intervention-can help address these challenges. Yet, limited integrated guidance exists to inform the design of such strategies. This article addresses this need by synthesizing the results of empirical studies to provide guidance about how to enhance the dissemination of children's mental health services research to policy makers. The article provides four recommendations about the content of policy maker-focused dissemination materials, discusses how strategic framing and message tailoring can increase the chances that evidence is persuasive to policy makers, and highlights strategies to ensure that evidence reaches policy makers."

            "abstract": "We evaluated the association between those symptoms/behaviours of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that were present at diagnosis and outcomes of treatment in children and adolescents in six European countries. Physicians abstracted clinical records from patients (6-17 years) diagnosed with ADHD between 2004 and 2007 and treated for ≥2 years. Physicians scored the severity of impairment for core ADHD symptoms and additional (non-core) ADHD symptoms/behaviours at diagnosis and estimated treatment adherence (defined as an estimated >80 % adherence on weekdays and >50 % adherence on weekends). Treatment modalities included pharmacological treatment, behavioural therapy, or both. Pharmacological treatment was further subclassified by medication class. The outcome, optimal treatment success (OTS), was defined as complete symptom control with high satisfaction with treatment. Multivariate logistic regression modelling examined the relationship between OTS and symptom impairment. Of 730 patients, 200 (27 %) achieved OTS. These patients were more likely to demonstrate lower impairment in non-core ADHD symptoms/behaviours and have fewer pre-existing comorbidities. They were also more likely to be adherent and engaged with treatment, with an explicit treatment goal to improve inattention/school performance. Neither core symptoms' severity nor treatment types were associated with OTS. OTS rates were low, with patients having less impairment of non-core ADHD symptoms/behaviours and fewer comorbidities more likely to achieve OTS. Potentially modifiable factors affecting OTS were as follows: treatment adherence, treatment engagement, and a treatment goal to improve inattention/school performance. These data suggest that there may be opportunities to optimize current treatment use, and develop new treatment strategies to improve core and non-core ADHD symptoms/behaviours."

Children of ethnic minority status continue to lag well behind their non-minority counterparts in the rate of diagnosis and treatment for the disorder. Racial/ethnic disparities in service use are the result of a combination of access barriers and individual, cultural, and societal factors. The ADHD Help-Seeking Behavior Model is proposed as a framework for understanding factors that may be predictive of service use. Variables specific to ADHD and ethnic-minority populations are integrated within the framework of a four-stage pathway model encompassing problem recognition, decision to seek help, service selection, and service use. The authors argue that by systematically addressing factors related to service use for each ethnic minority group, more effective intervention initiatives can be developed to improve identification and treatment for ADHD among underserved children."

We characterized the cognitive and emotional profile of NPS/polydrug users using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and EMOTICOM test battery in adult male (aged 20-49 years) recreational users without psychiatric comorbidities (n = 27; \"psychonauts\"), service users attending a UK specialist \"Club Drug\" Clinic for problematic use (n = 20) and healthy control volunteers without significant drug-taking histories (n = 35). Tasks were selected to distinguish \"hot\" cognitive processes that are highly influenced by emotion from \"cold\" cognitive processes that are largely independent of emotional influence. Both user groups reported significantly higher sensation-seeking traits compared with non-users. Recreational NPS users demonstrated more risk-taking behavior compared with controls and treatment-seeking NPS users showed poorer learning, episodic memory and response inhibition compared with the other two groups. These effects persisted, when controlling for age, intelligence, alcohol and cannabis use severity, nicotine dependence, trait anxiety, depression, childhood adversity, impulsivity, and sensation seeking. Overall, recreational NPS users showed elevated \"hot\" (emotion-laden) cognition in the absence of \"cold\" (non-emotional) cognitive deficits, whereas \"cold\" cognitive dysfunction was pronounced in individuals seeking treatment for problematic NPS use. High trait impulsivity and poor self-control may confer additional risk to NPS/polydrug use severity and separate those seeking treatment from those using NPS recreationally."

            "abstract": "The current study examined the effectiveness of a life skills training intervention on the psychological health of adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes. This quasi-randomized controlled trial recruited 80 individuals from the West Azerbaijan Diabetes Community in Urmia, Iran. Participants were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 40) or control (n = 40) groups. The intervention group received nine sessions of life skills training, and the control group received routine care only. Data collection tools included a demographics questionnaire and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. Compared to the control group, intervention group participants achieved statistically significant improvements in their physiological health, including stress (p < 0.04), anxiety (p < 0.04), and depression (p < 0.03). Nurses, including diabetes educators, should assess patients with diabetes for psychological complications and consider empowering adolescents and young adults with diabetes through life skills training, which can be incorporated into diabetes management plans to promote health and well-being.

            "abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common chronic conditions of childhood, with adverse consequences that persist through adolescence into adulthood. Thus, the burden of illness associated with ADHD is high for affected individuals, their families, and society at large. This article reviews available information about ADHD-associated utilisation of healthcare resources, direct medical costs, and the costs or cost effectiveness of pharmacological interventions. Published estimates suggest that direct medical costs for youth with ADHD are approximately double those for youth without ADHD. Cross-sectional studies suggest that ADHD-associated incremental costs are highest for mental health services and pharmaceutical costs, and are greatest for youth with comorbid psychiatric conditions and for those being treated with stimulant medication. To guide relevant clinical and health policy, additional research is warranted on the following: source of increased costs observed among persons with ADHD; patient characteristics of those accruing high medical costs; and the long-term effect of ADHD treatment on direct and indirect costs."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several recent studies of child outpatient mental health service use in the US have shown that having private insurance has no effect on the propensity to use services. Some studies also find that public coverage has no beneficial effect relative to no insurance. AIMS: This study explores several potential explanations, including inadequate measurement of mental health status, bandwagon effects, unobservable heterogeneity and public sector substitution for private services, for the lack of an effect of private insurance on service use. METHODS: We use secondary analysis of data from the three mainland US sites of NIMH's 1992 field trial of the Cooperative Agreement for Methodological Research for Multi-Site Surveys of Mental Disorders in Child and Adolescent Populations (MECA) Study. We examine whether or not a subject used any mental health service, school-based mental health services or outpatient mental health services, and the number of outpatient visits among users. We also examine use of general medical services as a check on our results. We conduct regression analysis; instrumental variables analysis, using instruments based on employment and parental history of mental health problems to identify insurance choice, and bivariate probit analysis to examine multiservice use. RESULTS: We find evidence that children with private health insurance have fewer observable (measured) mental health problems. They also appear to have a lower unobservable (latent) propensity to use mental health services than do children without coverage and those with Medicaid coverage. Unobserved differences in mental health status that relate to insurance choice are found to contribute to the absence of a positive effect for private insurance relative to no coverage in service use regressions. We find no evidence to suggest that differences in attitudes or differences in service availability in children's census tracts of residence explain the non-effect of insurance. Finally, we find that the lack of a difference is not a consequence of substitution of school-based for office-based services. School-based and office-based specialty mental health services are complements rather than substitutes. School-based services are used by the same children who use office-based services, even after controlling for mental health status. DISCUSSION: Our results are consistent with at least two explanations. First, limits on coverage under private insurance may discourage families who anticipate a need for child mental health services from purchasing such insurance. Second, publicly funded services may be readily available substitutes for private services, so that lack of insurance is not a barrier to adequate care. Despite the richness of data in the MECA dataset, cross-sectional data based on epidemiological surveys do not appear to be sufficient to fully understand the surprising result that insurance does not enable access to care. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND RESEARCH: Limits on coverage under private mental health insurance combined with a relatively extensive system of public mental health coverage have apparently generated a situation where there is no observed advantage to the marginal family of obtaining private mental health insurance coverage. Further research using longitudinal data is needed to better understand the nature of selection in the child mental health insurance market. Further research using better measures of the nature of treatment provided in different settings is needed to better understand how the private and public mental health systems operate."

Young people often stop taking ADHD medication during adolescence despite evidence that continuation would be beneficial. Increasingly, young people are restarting medication in early adulthood suggesting that cessation was premature. In this paper we explore the reasons given by young people for discontinuing ADHD medication.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Qualitative data from the Children and Adolescents with ADHD in Transition between Children's and Adult Services (CATCh-uS) project was analysed to look for reasons for stopping medication.

In the case of adolescents on long-term medicine prescription, more knowledge is needed regarding adherence and factors influencing adherence, which was the purpose of this study. Adolescents (n = 101) on ADHD medication ≥6 months were administrated questionnaires at a monitoring appointment: Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS), beliefs about medicines (BMQ) and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ). Adherence was high, the mean value was 88% of the maximum MARS score, and correlated positively with the \"BMQ-necessity-concerns differential\" but negatively with \"BMQ-concerns\" and \"BMQ-side effects\". Adolescents with more belief in the necessity of the medication, less concerns and less experience of side effects tended to be more adherent to medication prescription (\"intentional non-adherence\"), while \"unintentional non-adherence\" (forgetfulness) was associated with how much they perceived that their ADHD affected their lives. In a multiple regression model, the variance of MARS total (R 2 = 0.21) and \"intentional non-adherence\" (R 2 = 0.24) was explained by the \"BMQ-necessity-concern differential\" and \"BMQ-experienced side effects\". The variance of \"unintentional non-adherence\" (R 2 = 0.12) was explained by the \"BMQ-necessity-concern differential\" and \"B-IPQ-consequences of ADHD\". In conclusion, adolescents on long-term medication reported good adherence, mainly influenced by more beliefs in the necessity versus concerns of the medications, less experienced side effects and more perceived consequences of ADHD. BMQ could be useful to identify risks of low adherence, which should be counteracted by partially gender-specific interventions."

In this longitudinal study we set out to test the predictive ability of a number of cognitive, affective, and social factors in the early development of paranoia in a clinical adolescent population. Thirty four help-seeking adolescents, aged 11-16 years, reporting paranoid thoughts and attending mental health services were recruited. Self-report and interview assessments of paranoia were conducted at baseline. Measures relating to a cognitive model of persecutory delusions were completed. Paranoia was reassessed after three months with thirty three participants. Significant predictors of paranoia persistence were anxiety, depression, worry, negative self-beliefs, perceptual anomalies, insomnia, affective reactivity, bullying, and cyber victimization. No effect was found for reasoning bias or negative perceptions of academic ability, social competence, and physical appearance. In conclusion, many of the maintenance factors implicated in adult paranoia are likely to prove important in the early development of paranoia in young people. Further experimental and treatment studies are now needed to examine the causal role of these factors in the occurrence of paranoia in adolescents."

            "abstract": "Aim:\n        \n      \n      Mood and anxiety disorders typically begin during adolescence or early adulthood. Yet services targeting this population are frequently lacking. This study implemented an outreach, access and assessment programme for youth with these concerns. The data reported constitute an evaluation of this mental healthcare delivery approach.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This evaluation included specification of both programme and implementation theories through causal and programme logic models and formative (process) evaluation. Outreach focused on access points for youth such as schools and family physicians' offices. Concerned youth were encouraged to self-refer. Participants completed a semi-structured clinical interview and symptom and function questionnaire package.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Engagement sessions were conducted and results involved 93 youth. The majority of youth self-referred, a process not possible in traditional physician-referral healthcare systems. Interestingly, almost half had received prior treatment and over half had tried a psychiatric medication. Yet participants had significant symptomatology: 81% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 95% reported high levels of trait-anxiety. Functional impairment was substantial: on average, participants missed 2.6 days of school/work and functioned at reduced levels on 4.2 days in the week prior to assessment. Demographic details are presented.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This study evaluated a mental healthcare delivery system that identified individuals with significant distress and functional impairment from mood/anxiety concerns and previous unsuccessful treatment attempts, verifying that they were in need of mental health services. This approach provides a model for outreach and assessment in this population, where earlier intervention has the potential to prevent chronic mental illness and disability."

            "abstract": "To enhance the prevention and intervention efforts of childhood obesity, there is a strong need for the early detection of psychological factors contributing to its development and maintenance. Rather than a stable condition, childhood obesity represents a dynamic process, in which behavior, cognition and emotional regulation interact mutually with each other. Family structure and context, that is, parental and familial attitudes, activity, nutritional patterns as well as familial stress, have an important role with respect to the onset and maintenance of overweight and obesity. Behavioral and emotional problems are found in many, though not all, obese children, with a higher prevalence in clinical, treatment-seeking samples. The interrelatedness between obesity and psychological problems seems to be twofold, in that clinically meaningful psychological distress might foster weight gain and obesity may lead to psychosocial problems. The most frequently implicated psychosocial factors are externalizing (impulsivity and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) and internalizing (depression and anxiety) behavioral problems and uncontrolled eating behavior. These findings strengthen the need to further explore the interrelatedness between psychological problems and childhood obesity."

In this study, we interviewed 15 adolescents to examine how the views and behaviours of others influence teens' decisions about seeking care for depression. Using a grounded theory approach, we found that teens' families, peers, and siblings contributed uniquely to teens' decisions in seeking care for depression. Families may disclose a \"heritage\" of depression, and their choices about disclosing family mental health issues, previous treatment, and coping strategies affected teens' understanding of depression. Peer \"depression guides,\" who had themselves experienced depression, provided teens with advice on recognizing depression, managing stigma, and seeking care. Siblings bridged the roles of peer and family, influencing teens' choices about accessing treatment.

The present study is the first report in Japan evaluating the proportion of comorbidity in ADHD cases presenting in the clinical setting, aiming at clarifying the picture of ADHD in Japan. The subjects consisted of 68 child and adolescent cases meeting criteria for ADHD (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edn) under treatment at a child psychiatry clinic (IQ > 50, mental age >or= 4 years old). Disorders evaluated as comorbid disorders were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, elimination disorders, sleep disorders, tic disorders, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), school refusal, and epilepsy. Comorbidity with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, ODD, and CD, were found to be lower than the high rates conventionally reported in North America. The lower age of the present subjects, primarily in infancy and elementary school age with few adolescent cases, and a bias towards milder cases from an outpatient clinic without inpatient facilities are believed to be factors accounting for this disparity. Furthermore, it was a notable fact that mentally delayed cases (IQ: 51-84) amounted to 34% of the cases, indicating the necessity to consider intelligence level when formulating a treatment strategy for ADHD."

Findings reported by this cohort of 60 adolescent women included: medication adherence, 64.3% reporting adherence at baseline and 45.0% at 12 months; HIV stigma score of 57.60 (standard deviation [SD], 11.83; range, 25-86). HIV stigma was not found to be a significant predictor when binary logit regression was run with medication adherence at 1 year. Using moderational analysis, factors that could moderate stigma's effect on medication adherence was still pursued and identified the following to be significant at 12 months: health care satisfaction (B = -0.020, standard error [SE] = 0.010, p < .05); and Coping (proactive coping strategies [B = 0.012, SE = 0.005, p < .05]; turning to family [B = 0.012, SE = 0.016, p < 0.05]; spiritual coping [B = 0.021, SE = 0.010, p < 0.05]; professional help [B = 0.021, SE = 0.010, p < 0.05]; physical diversions [B = 0.016, SE = 0.007, p < 0.05]).

Transition refers to a transfer to an adult mental health service (AMHS), to private care or other mental health community services. A transition plan can also lead to a managed end of specialized care with involvement of a general practitioner or social services. For young people with a diagnosis of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) or ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), two disorders that persist into adulthood, an optimal transition would ensure continuity of care or facilitate access to specialized care in the case of a discharge. Transition typically occurs during adolescence, a known sensitive period when young people may experience major changes at several levels: physiological, psychological and social. Any barrier in the transition process resulting in discontinuity of care may worsen the symptoms of ADHD or ASD and can ultimately adversely affect the global mental health of young people with such neurodevelopmental disorders.

The participants were presented with the 'friend in need' questionnaire designed to elicit the participants' recognition of the disorder depicted in two vignettes and their recommendation about the appropriate source of help-seeking. One vignette was of a clinically depressed case while the other vignette was about a girl undergoing normal life crisis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Out of the 285 students recruited into the study, 277 questionnaires were adequately completed indicating a response rate of 97.2%. A total of 4.8% (n = 13) participants correctly identified and labelled the depression vignette. Only four respondents (1.5%) recommended professional help from a Psychiatrist or Psychologist. Insomnia was the most identified symptom of distress for depression (17.1%). Females demonstrated higher mental health literacy, in terms of their ability to correctly label the depression vignettes, their expression of greater concern over a depressed peer than males, their expectation that depression requires a longer recovery than normal teenage problems and in their ability to identify individual symptoms of depression. Family and friends were the most recommended source of help.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Mental health literacy was abysmally low amongst the adolescents surveyed.

            "abstract": "To understand whether changes exist in the types of youths mental health problems addressed in emergency in a context of increasing demand, we conducted a retrospective chart review in an emergency care outpatient unit. Data from children and adolescents admitted at four different time periods (years 1981, 1992, 2002, and 2017) were compared to determine trends in terms of patients' characteristics, nature of the mental health problems and final care decisions. Between 1981 and 2017 there was a 3.85 times increase in the annual number of patients presenting to the emergency consultations. The proportion of youths being referred for anxiety or depressive symptoms sharply increased over time, while no differences were found for the proportion of aggressive behaviors and suicidal attempts. Anxiety disorders became the most frequent discharge psychiatric disorder in youths admitted in the emergency unit, rising from 5% in 1981 to 34% in 2017. Significant changes were also observed in the source of referral to the emergency unit; in particular emergency consultations in 2017 were about twice as likely as in 1981 to be requested directly by the family. This data suggested that the increased use of emergency services observed over the last decades is associated with significant changes in the patient and his/her family's demands about mental health difficulties. Such findings are worth considering for mental health interventions that aim to address the emergency overcrowding issue."

While these three disasters caused tremendous physical damage, their psychological impact remains unclear. The present study evaluated traumatic responses, internalizing (i.e., anxiety and depression), and externalizing (i.e., anger) symptoms among Japanese young people in the immediate aftermath and 2.5 years later. A total of 435 undergraduates were recruited from universities in three differentially exposed regions: Fukushima, Tokyo, and Kyoto. They completed a set of questionnaires retrospectively (i.e., September to December 2013) to measure their traumatic responses, anxiety and depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and anger immediately after the disaster and 2.5 years later. Participants in Tokyo had the highest level of traumatic response and internalizing symptoms immediately after the earthquake, whereas those in Fukushima had significantly higher levels of trait anger, anger-in (holding one's anger in), and anger-out (expressing one's anger externally). In Kyoto, the levels of anxiety and depression after 2.5 years were significantly higher than they were immediately after the disasters. In conclusion, anger symptoms were high among young people who lived at or near the center of the disasters, while anxiety and depression were high among those who lived far away from the disasters. These findings suggest the importance of providing mental health services to young people who did not live near the disaster area as well as to those living in the directly affected area."

We had three goals: (1) to explore the performance of a new lifetime version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS-Lifetime) to assess lifetime prevalence of PND; (2) to assess prevalence of lifetime PND in women with prior histories of major depressive episode (MDE); and (3) to evaluate risk factors for PND. Subjects were from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). The EPDS was modified by adding lifetime PND screening questions, assessing worst episode, and symptom timing of onset. Of 682 women with lifetime MDD and a live birth, 276 (40.4 %) had a positive EPDS score of ≥12 consistent with PND. Women with PND more often sought professional help (p < 0.001) and received treatment (p = 0.001). Independent risk indicators for PND included younger age, higher education, high neuroticism, childhood trauma, and sexual abuse. We found that two in five parous women with a history of MDD had lifetime PND and that the PND episodes were more severe than MDD occurring outside of the perinatal period.

It is difficult to develop clinical skills in the management of residual adult manifestations of developmental disorders without clinical experience with their presentation in childhood. Adult patients are increasingly seeking treatment for the symptoms of ADHD, and physicians need practice guidelines. Adult ADHD often presents differently from childhood ADHD. Because adult ADHD can be comorbid with other disorders and has symptoms similar to those of other disorders, it is important to understand differential diagnoses. Physicians should work with patients to provide feedback about their symptoms, to educate them about ADHD, and to set treatment goals. Treatment for ADHD in adults should include a medication trial, restructuring of the patient's environment to make it more compatible with the symptoms of ADHD, and ongoing supportive management to address any residual impairment and to facilitate functional and developmental improvements."

            "abstract": "Mental health encompasses a range of mental, emotional, social, and behavioral functioning and occurs along a continuum from good to poor. Previous research has documented that mental health among children and adolescents is associated with immediate and long-term physical health and chronic disease, health risk behaviors, social relationships, education, and employment. Public health surveillance of children's mental health can be used to monitor trends in prevalence across populations, increase knowledge about demographic and geographic differences, and support decision-making about prevention and intervention. Numerous federal data systems collect data on various indicators of children's mental health, particularly mental disorders. The 2013-2019 data from these data systems show that mental disorders begin in early childhood and affect children with a range of sociodemographic characteristics. During this period, the most prevalent disorders diagnosed among U.S. children and adolescents aged 3-17 years were attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and anxiety, each affecting approximately one in 11 (9.4%-9.8%) children. Among children and adolescents aged 12-17 years, one fifth (20.9%) had ever experienced a major depressive episode. Among high school students in 2019, 36.7% reported persistently feeling sad or hopeless in the past year, and 18.8% had seriously considered attempting suicide. Approximately seven in 100,000 persons aged 10-19 years died by suicide in 2018 and 2019. Among children and adolescents aged 3-17 years, 9.6%-10.1% had received mental health services, and 7.8% of all children and adolescents aged 3-17 years had taken medication for mental health problems during the past year, based on parent report. Approximately one in four children and adolescents aged 12-17 years reported having received mental health services during the past year. In federal data systems, data on positive indicators of mental health (e.g., resilience) are limited. Although no comprehensive surveillance system for children's mental health exists and no single indicator can be used to define the mental health of children or to identify the overall number of children with mental disorders, these data confirm that mental disorders among children continue to be a substantial public health concern. These findings can be used by public health professionals, health care providers, state health officials, policymakers, and educators to understand the prevalence of specific mental disorders and other indicators of mental health and the challenges related to mental health surveillance."

Theoretical accounts of illness perception suggest that it is multi-dimensional, consisting of at least five core constructs (see the common-sense model of illness representations or CSM: Leventhal et al., in: Rachman (ed) Medical psychology, Pergamon, New York, vol 2, pp 7-30, 1980, in: Baum, Taylor, Singer (eds) Handbook of psychology and health: social psychological aspects of health, Earlbaum, Hillsdale, vol 4, pp 219-252, 1984). We suggest that the application of CSM in children/adolescents with ADHD and their parents may play an important role in understanding their coping behavior, treatment adherence, and emotional well-being. A systematic search identified 101 eligible studies that investigated the perception of ADHD among diagnosed children/adolescents and their parents. In general, these studies support the existence of the multiple facets of illness representations proposed by the CSM in both diagnosed youngsters and parents indicating substantial variability among both parents and youngsters on each of these facets. The comprehensive assessment of the representations of ADHD indicates imbalance attention to the different representations of ADHD in the literature; disproportional research attention has been paid to the perceived effectiveness of treatment (i.e., treatment control dimension) compared to other illness representations (e.g., timeline, consequence, and coherence), despite research showing their relevance to treatment adherence among other implications. The review identifies the limitation of existing relevant research, needed foci for future studies, specific testable hypotheses, and potential clinical implications of the multifaceted representations of ADHD among youngsters and carers alike."

However, the prevalence of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents, combined with the practical and psychological obstacles that often prevent families from accessing professional help, mean that alternative ways of reaching prospective clients must be explored. This pilot study aims to compare the relative efficacy of two different modes of delivering a family-focused, cognitive-behavioral intervention for children with an anxiety disorder. The two modalities compared were: a parent-delivered program (bibliotherapy) and a clinician-delivered program (individual therapy). Twenty-seven children aged between 7 and 14, together with their parents, were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions listed above. Results at post-treatment showed a significant improvement for children in both treatment conditions in terms of diagnostic status, number of diagnoses and severity of primary diagnosis at follow-up. Children in the bibliotherapy condition demonstrated a significant improvement over time in terms of child- and parent-reported anxiety levels. No differences were found between the two treatment conditions on any outcome measure. These results were maintained at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Although a pilot study, these data suggest that a bibliotherapy format of the intervention described may have potential merit.

            "abstract": "The process of transitioning youth from child to adult mental health services is poorly managed, and many adolescents disengage from services during transfer. The waxing and waning of symptoms over time means that some youth who are asymptomatic prior to transfer (15-17 years) will be at high risk for recurrence during the transition period. There are no clear, evidence-based guidelines about who should transfer to adult care. Objectives were to propose: (1) criteria to define anxious or depressed youth (16-21 years) that should transfer and (2) levels of service needed in young adulthood. Natural history of psychopathology and treatment response for depression and anxiety was reviewed. Risk factors for recurrence and persistence, such as initial severity, comorbidity, and family functioning, can help to identify youth requiring transfer. Few controlled treatment studies have examined predictors of long-term course. Recommendations for follow-up care and ongoing monitoring during young adulthood are discussed."

Standardized instruments measured: (1) children/adolescent characteristics [(1.1) Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS-PL)-psychiatric disorders; (1.2) Ten Questions Screen-neurodevelopment problems; (1.3) two subtests of WISC-III-estimated IQ; (1.4) Academic Performance Test-school performance)], (2) factors related to mothers/main caregivers (Self-Reporting Questionnaire-anxiety/depression), (3) family (Brazilian Research-Companies-Association's Questionnaire-SES).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Only 19.8% of children/adolescents with psychiatric disorder have used mental health services in the previous 12 months.

The decision can be considered as a result of information exchange between the different actors involved. The process of making a decision is equally important as the decision itself, especially when the decision considers minors with mental disorders. The presence and the type of interaction determine the information available to the juvenile judges to make their final decision. The overall aim of this study is to gain insight into the role of all actors, including the juvenile judge, in the juvenile judge's decision-making process in cases relating to minors with mental disorders. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with professional actors (n=32), minors (n=31) and parents (n=17). The findings indicated that the judge's decision is overall the result of an interaction between the juvenile judge, the social services investigator and the youth psychiatrist. The other professional actors, the minors and the parents had only a limited role in the decision-making process. The research concludes that the judge's decision-making process should be based on dialogue, and requires enhanced collaboration between the juvenile court and youth psychiatrists from mental health services. Future decision-making research should pay more attention to the interactions of the actors that guide a juvenile judge's decision."

In addition, we assessed whether the perception of social support is correlated to psychological well-being. The study recruited a non-probability sample of 143 mothers of children with ASD and a comparison group of 143 mothers of children with typical development. For data collection, an online questionnaire was used to investigate the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress using the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and examine social support for mothers using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Results No significant difference was observed in the levels of depression and anxiety between both groups. Nevertheless, extremely severe levels of depression and anxiety were observed in 23.1% and 27.3% of mothers in the ASD group compared with 11.9% and 16.8% for the control group, respectively.

One of the ways to bring these people into treatment is through telephonic helplines.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Following a large number of suicides in the city of Chandigarh in 2003, The department of Psychiatry, GMCH, Chandigarh was designated as nodal center for the prevention of suicide. A 24-hour suicide prevention helpline was set up as an immediate measure to help persons in crisis. Apart from providing telephonic counseling to persons in crisis, the helpline coordinated with police, media, schools, radio stations etc., to reduce the number of suicides in the city.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Majority of the callers were males (65.93%), between 20 to 39 years old (56.34%), married (79.50%), had less than 12 years of formal education (60.68%), and were earning less than Rs. 5000/month (56.80%). 72.96% callers had contacted the mental health services for the first time. A significant number of persons (434, 13.26%) called the helpline for marital, academic, stress-related problems. Majority of the calls were received between 8 A.M. and 2 P.M. The number of suicides in the city of Chandigarh showed a decline in the following years since the helpline was set up.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The telephonic helpline seems to be a very effective way of getting persons into contact with health services.

            "abstract": "We present prevalence and treatment utilization rates for child anxiety disorders in a university-affiliated primary care clinic. Families were recruited from a pediatric patient list and 714 families participated in an initial study wherein they completed child anxiety questionnaires. According to parent and child self-report questionnaires (n=714), 22% and 20% of children, respectively, were above a suggested clinical cutoff on a brief anxiety screen; 19% and 14% of children exceeded clinical cutoffs on a separate social anxiety questionnaire. All families were invited to participate in a second study that included the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children-Parent Version and questions about treatment utilization; telephone interviews with 190 parents showed 1-year prevalence rates of DSM-IV child disorders to be 10.0% (se=2.2%) for specific phobia, 6.8% (se=1.8%) for social phobia, 3.2% (se=1.3%) for generalized anxiety disorder, 0.5% (se=.7%) for selective mutism, 1.6% (se=.9%) for major depressive disorder, 1.1% (se=.7%) for dysthymia, and 12.6% (se=2.4%) for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Among children with a current anxiety disorder, 31% had received counseling or medication treatment during their lifetime, compared to 40% of children with depression and 79% with ADHD. Adolescent age and being Caucasian were predictors of psychotherapy use; having an ADHD diagnosis was a predictor of both psychotherapy and medication use. The high prevalence of impairing anxiety disorders, in concert with the very low extent of treatment utilization, suggests a need for methods to identify and disseminate empirically validated treatments for these disorders in the primary care setting.\n"

            "abstract": "ADHD is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder presenting to child and adolescent mental health, paediatric, and primary care services. Timely and effective interventions to address core ADHD symptoms and co-occurring problems are a high priority for healthcare and society more widely. While much research has reported on the benefits and adverse effects of different interventions for ADHD, these individual research reports and the reviews, meta-analyses and guidelines summarizing their findings are sometimes inconsistent and difficult to interpret. We have summarized the current evidence and identified several methodological issues and gaps in the current evidence that we believe are important for clinicians to consider when evaluating the evidence and making treatment decisions. These include understanding potential impact of bias such as inadequate blinding and selection bias on study outcomes; the relative lack of high-quality data comparing different treatments and assessing long-term effectiveness, adverse effects and safety for both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments; and the problems associated with observational studies, including those based on large national registries and comparing treatments with each other. We highlight key similarities across current international clinical guidelines and discuss the reasons for divergence where these occur. We discuss the integration of these different perspective into a framework for person/family-centered evidence-based practice approach to care that aims to achieve optimal outcomes that prioritize individual strengths and impairments, as well as the personal treatment targets of children and their families. Finally, we consider how access to care for this common and impairing disorder can be improved in different healthcare systems."

Since parents are the key decision makers regarding their child's health care, their thoughts regarding medication use are crucial to whether children take prescribed stimulants. To develop an understanding of what parents think about using stimulants to treat their children's ADHD symptoms we consulted groups of parents about their experiences.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using qualitative methods informed by phenomenology, three focus groups of parents were asked to describe their experiences parenting a child with ADHD and using stimulant medications for treatment.

Studies have begun to explore experiences of bullying and the associated psychological distress in TGD youth; however, they often fail to distinguish among the separate groups within LGBT samples. This study sought to explore the prevalence, nature, and outcomes of bullying in TGD youth attending a transgender health service in the United Kingdom, taking into account birth-assigned sex and out and social transition status. Methods: Before their first appointment at a specialist gender clinic, participants completed a brief sociodemographic questionnaire, a questionnaire assessing experiences and outcomes of bullying, and a clinically validated measure of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Results: A total of 274 TGD people aged 16-25 years participated in the study. The majority of participants (86.5%) reported having experienced bullying, predominantly in school. Bullying was more prevalent in birth-assigned females and in out individuals, and commonly consisted of homophobic/transphobic (particularly in socially transitioned individuals) or appearance-related (particularly in out individuals) name calling. Individuals who reported having experienced bullying showed greater anxiety symptomology and also self-reported anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem as effects of bullying. Birth-assigned females also reported greater effects on family relationships and social life. Conclusion: These findings indicate very high levels of bullying within the young TGD population attending a transgender health service in the United Kingdom, which affects wellbeing significantly. More intervention work and education need to be introduced in schools to reduce bullying."

The immigrant sample also responded to questions about acculturation orientation using the Vancouver Index of Acculturation Scale.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Significant differences were found in the endorsement of traditional (e.g., religious leader), informal (e.g., family), and semiformal (e.g., internet forum) help-sources between immigrant groups, and between immigrant groups and the Norwegian respondent group. Immigrants from Pakistan and Somalia endorsed traditional help sources to a greater extent than immigrants from Russia and Poland, and the Norwegian student sample. There were no ethnic differences in endorsement of formal mental help sources (e.g., a medical doctor). Maintenance of the culture of origin as the acculturation orientation was associated with preferences for traditional and informal help sources, while the adoption of mainstream culture was associated with semiformal and formal help-seeking sources.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Ethnic differences in help-seeking sources need to be considered when designing and implementing mental health services."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Peripheral facial nerve palsy is characterized by unilateral facial paresis due to ipsilateral facial nerve dysfunction. Most cases are idiopathic; however, some have specific etiologies, such as herpesvirus infection, immunological disorders, and hypertension. Atomoxetine is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This drug is known to cause adverse effects, such as nausea, appetite loss, headache, insomnia, and hypertension.\n    \n\n\n          Case description:\n        \n      \n      We herein describe a case of sudden-onset right peripheral facial palsy in a 9-year-old Japanese boy. The patient's systolic blood pressure was as high as 200 mmHg, and he was therefore admitted to our hospital for investigation. Extensive surveillance including blood examination; endocrinological testing; imaging studies such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and renography; and renal biopsy did not reveal any abnormalities. The patient had ADHD and was under treatment with atomoxetine. We discontinued treatment with atomoxetine; the patient showed gradual improvement. His hypertension and facial palsy resolved. We therefore diagnosed the patient with peripheral facial palsy associated with atomoxetine-induced hypertension.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Although peripheral facial nerve palsy is usually benign and self-limiting, blood pressure should be monitored in children under treatment with atomoxetine and the possibility of drug-induced hypertension should be considered in order to prevent palsy associated with hypertension."

Hence, the present study aimed to investigate predictors of stigmatizing attitudes towards different mental disorders (including less researched ones) in a representative sample of adolescents and young adults.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data from the Swiss Youth Mental Health Literacy and Stigma Survey were used (analytical sample: n = 4,932). Each participant was randomly presented with one of five vignettes (depression; alcohol abuse; depression and alcohol abuse combined; schizophrenia; social anxiety). The structure of stigmatizing attitudes was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. Regression models, implemented within a structural equation framework, were used to study predictors for the identified latent variables.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A three-factor model for stigmatizing attitudes-consisting of 'dangerous/unpredictable', 'weak-no-sick', and 'social distance' factors-best fitted the data. Female gender was associated with less stigmatizing attitudes. Associations in opposite directions with different latent factors were found for educational and migration background. Exposure to mental disorders (being personally affected, personally having received professional help or knowing someone close who has received treatment for a mental disorder) was either not or was negatively associated with stigmatizing attitudes. In contrast, current mental health symptoms (heightened levels of psychological distress, problematic alcohol use) were generally not or were positively associated with stigmatizing attitudes. Even though the included predictors had some predictive value, the variance explained by the models was rather small (the adjusted R2 varied between 0.03 and 0.26).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The current study indicates that contact with someone who has received treatment for a mental disorder might be an important component of programs aiming to decrease stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental disorders, since this exposure variable predicted lower levels of stigmatizing attitudes. Furthermore, the findings suggest that target-group interventions for specific subgroups need to be considered, as the process leading to stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental disorders appears to differ between specific sociodemographic subgroups."

Patients ages 14-24 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, juvenile dermatomyositis, or systemic lupus erythematous, and parents of patients ages 8-24 with these diseases were eligible (not required to participate in pairs).

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being and health-compromising behaviors of adolescents (12-18 years) previously referred for mental health services. Data were collected (pre-pandemic n = 3712; pandemic n = 3197) from mental health agencies across Ontario, Canada using the interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health assessment. Our findings revealed no increased incidence of witnessing domestic violence nor experiencing physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. Further, there were no increases in the risk of self-harm and suicide, anxiety, or depression among our sample of clinically referred youth. Finally, results demonstrated no increase in problematic videogaming/internet use, disordered eating, or alcohol intoxication, and a decrease in cannabis use. Our findings add to the growing body of knowledge as to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and youth. Further, findings underscore the importance of understanding the nuanced impact of the pandemic on various subgroups of children, youth, and families and highlight the need for continued monitoring of outcomes for these children and youth."

The survey showed that children and young people (CYP) with neurodevelopmental conditions presented more frequently to paediatrics than to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). In addition, a sizeable proportion of CYP with emotional difficulties presented to paediatricians (eg, 29.5% for anxiety/obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and 12.8% for depression)-mainly due to difficulty with accessing CAMHS. More than half of the community paediatricians are involved in the care of CYP with anxiety and OCD, while 32.3% are involved in the care of those with depression.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There is significant involvement of community paediatricians in the care of CYP with mental health conditions. Involvement is highest for neurodevelopmental conditions, but also significant for CYP with emotional difficulties. The implication of the findings for surveillance case ascertainment is that joint BPSU and CAPSS is recommended for surveillance studies of neurodevelopmental conditions. However, for emotional disorders, single or joint surveillance should be made based on the specific research question and the relative trade-offs between case ascertainment, and the additional cost and reporting burden of joint surveillance. Single CAPSS studies remain appropriate for psychosis and bipolar disorder."

The 674 participants (52.8 % African Americans, 47.2 % Puerto Ricans; 60.1 % women) in this study were first seen in 1990 when the participants attended schools serving the East Harlem area of New York City. A structural equation model controlling for the participants' gender, educational level in emerging adulthood, and age at the most recent data collection showed significant standardized pathways from both ethnicity (β = -0.28; z = -4.82; p < 0.001) and psychological symptoms (β = 0.15; z = 2.41; p < 0.05), both measured in emerging adulthood, to smoking in the early 30s. That, in turn, was associated with certain physical diseases and symptoms (i.e., respiratory) in the mid-30s (β = 0.16; z = 2.59; p < 0.05). These physical diseases and symptoms had a cross-sectional association with family financial difficulty in the mid-30s (β = 0.21; z = 4.53; p < 0.001), which in turn also had a cross-sectional association with psychiatric disorders (β = 0.30; z = 5.30; p < 0.001). Psychiatric disorders had a cross-sectional association with mental health services utilization (β = 0.65; z = 13.25; p < 0.001). Additional pathways from the other domains to mental health services utilization in the mid-30s were also supported by the mediating role of psychiatric disorders. Results obtained from this research offer theoretical and practical information regarding the processes leading to the use of mental health services."

It is common, a risk factor for suicide and is associated with adverse psychosocial consequences. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend that children and young people with moderate-to-severe depression should be seen within Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and receive specific psychological interventions, possibly in combination with antidepressant medication. Cognitive behavioural therapy (in some studies) and interpersonal psychotherapy have been demonstrated to be more effective than active control treatments for depressed adolescents. For children with depression, there is some evidence that family focused approaches are more effective than individual therapy. Fluoxetine is the antidepressant with the greatest evidence for effectiveness compared with placebo. Treatment with antidepressants and/or psychological therapy is likely to reduce suicidality, although in some young people, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors lead to increased suicidality. There is limited evidence that combination of specific psychological therapy and antidepressant medication is better than treatment with monotherapy. There are methodological limitations in the published literature that make it difficult to relate study findings to the more severely ill clinical population in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. Young people should have access to both evidence-based psychological interventions and antidepressants for paediatric depression. Collaborative decisions on treatment should be made jointly by young people, their carers and clinicians, taking into account individual circumstances and potential benefits, risks and availability of treatment."

            "abstract": "Experiencing sexual violence in childhood or adolescence is highly prevalent among some women living with HIV, often resulting in anxiety and depression symptoms in adulthood. Anxiety and depression have been associated with HIV medication nonadherence, yet little research has assessed distinct components of anxiety and depression as risk factors of HIV medication nonadherence. The current study examined distinct symptom components of anxiety and depression as predictors of HIV medication non-adherence among women living with HIV and childhood sexual abuse enrolled in a coping intervention. This secondary analysis included a sample of 85 women living with HIV and childhood sexual abuse and being prescribed antiretroviral medication who completed measures on anxiety, depression, and medication adherence. Results from a logistic regression analysis suggest that distinct components of anxiety may be related to medication nonadherence among this population. Targeted mental health interventions for this population may increase adherence to antiretroviral medication."

The epidemiologic part of this work consists in a case-control comparison of socio-demographic characteristics among subjects with panic disturbance and others unaffected with it. It allows to conclude that panic disturbance is two times more frequent in women than in men and most often in young people. The results of the therapeutic with Clomipramine at low dosage (40 mg) objective a complete removal of panic attacks in 21.5% and 64% of patients after a respectively 15 days treatment. Other criteria of evaluation (Hamilton Depression Rating scale--HDRS), Montgomery and Asberg Depression Scale--MADRS--, clinician's global assessment) evolve favorably also. It is however interesting to note that though it is not in originally more depressed patients that panic disturbance is most improved by treatment, there is on the other hand a correlation between scores from MADRS and HDRS and the number of panic attacks under treatment. These results corroborate the hypothesis that Clomipramine can be effective at low dosage in some patients with panic disturbance--here, slightly less than 2/3 of the cases--while for other patients higher dosages are necessary."

This qualitative investigation into the experiences of Black high school students with ADHD, their caregivers, teachers, and school mental health providers (SMHPs) aimed to understand this community's experiences with ADHD across development and to explore the barriers/facilitators to adequate services. Through focus group interviews with stakeholders (i.e., 6 adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD, 5 caregivers of adolescents with ADHD, 6 teachers, 5 school mental health providers), themes emerged related to (1) developmental changes observed in ADHD presentation in high school students and (2) contextual factors (including barriers/facilitators to optimal school and home functioning).

New clinical services for children and young people aged 0 to 25 years may represent a radical transformation of mental healthcare. Method: Critical, non-systematic review of the PubMed literature up to 3rd January 2019. Results: Rationale: the youngest age group has an increased risk of developing mental disorders and 75% of mental disorders begin by the age of 24 and prodromal features may start even earlier. Most of the risk factors for mental disorders exert their role before the age of 25, profound maturational brain changes occur from mid-childhood through puberty to the mid-20s, and mental disorders that persist in adulthood have poor long-term outcomes. The optimal window of opportunity to improve the outcomes of mental disorders is the prevention or early treatment in individuals aged 0 to 25 within a clinical staging model framework. Unmet needs: children and young people face barriers to primary and secondary care access, delays in receiving appropriate treatments, poor engagement, cracks between child and adult mental health services, poor involvement in the design of mental health services, and lack of evidence-based treatments. Evidence: the most established paradigm for reforming youth mental services focuses on people aged 12-25 who experienced early stages of psychosis. Future advancements may include early stages of depression and bipolar disorders. Broader youth mental health services have been implemented worldwide, but no single example constitutes best practice. These services seem to improve access, symptomatic and functional outcomes, and satisfaction of children and young people aged 12-25. However, there are no robust controlled trials demonstrating their impact. Very limited evidence is available for integrated mental health services that focus on people aged 0-12. Conclusions: Children and young people aged 12-25 need youth-friendly mental health services that are sensitive to their unique stage of clinical, neurobiological, and psychosocial development. Early intervention for psychosis services may represent the starting platform to refine the next generation of integrated youth mental health services."

The study relied on a novel definition of medication adherence as a timely renewal of an index prescription determined using the electronically recorded issuance of a stimulant prescription in the EMR (\"refill\").\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Prescription and sociodemographic data were extracted from the Partners HealthCare Research Patient Data Registry to calculate adherence to stimulant medication treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the EMR, 2,206 patients with prescriptions for central nervous system stimulant medication were identified. Results showed that 46% of the index prescriptions were refilled within the timeframe necessary for the patient to be considered consistently medicated. A multivariable logistic regression model predicting medication adherence from patient demographic and treatment characteristics yielded an area-under-the-curve statistic of 0.57, indicating that these characteristics predicted adherence only modestly better than chance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      EMR data from a large health care organization showed that 46% of pediatric patients were adherent to treatment with stimulants. Rates of medication adherence were worse among patients receiving care from a primary care provider than among those receiving care from a psychiatrist, in older patients, and in female patients and did not appear to be influenced by racial-ethnic group, economic class, stimulant type, or medication formulation (short or long acting). These findings, which show low rates of medication adherence among children and adolescents with ADHD, suggest the need for efforts to improve these rates."

            "abstract": "Asthma is among the most common medical conditions affecting children and young people, with adolescence a recognised period of increased risk, overrepresented in analyses examining recent increasing asthma mortality rates. Asthma may change significantly during this period and management also occurs in the context of patients seeking increased autonomy and self-governance whilst navigating increasing academic and social demands. A number of disease factors can destabilise asthma during adolescence including: increased rates of anaphylaxis, anxiety, depression, obesity, and, in females, an emerging resistance to corticosteroids and the pro-inflammatory effects of oestrogen. Patient factors such as smoking, vaping, poor symptom recognition, treatment non-adherence and variable engagement with health services contribute to difficult to treat asthma. Significant deficiencies in the current approach to transition have been identified by a recent EAACI task force, and subsequent asthma-specific recommendations, published in 2020 provide an important framework moving forward. As with other chronic conditions, effective transition programmes plan ahead, engage with adolescents and their families to identify the patients' management priorities and the current challenges they are experiencing with treatment. Transition needs may vary significantly across asthma patients and for more complex asthma may include dedicated transition clinics involving multidisciplinary care requiring input including, amongst others, allergy and immunology, psychological medicine, respiratory physicians and scientists and nurse specialists. Across different global regions, barriers to treatment may vary but need to be elicited and an individualised approach taken to optimising asthma care which is sustainable within the local adult healthcare system."

            "abstract": "Increasing numbers of young adults need continued support for their attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) beyond the age-boundary for children's services. The sparse literature on transition in general suggests patchy provision and huge gaps in transitional care, but also that young people with ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders fair particularly badly. Transition in health care coincides with many other important life-transitions while the difficulties associated with ADHD may make these challenges particularly hard to cope with. Parents or other advocates therefore often need to be involved, which can present problems in adult mental health services given that they tend to be less family oriented than children's services. Importantly, young people need help negotiating the transition from passive recipient of care to active self-management, and in building relationships with the adult team.In addition to patchy provision of adult ADHD services, transition is currently hampered by poor understanding of ADHD as a long term condition and uncertain knowledge of what services are available among young people and parents as well as the clinicians working with them. Guidelines recommend, and more importantly young people want, access to psycho-social interventions as well as medication. However, available evidence suggests poor quality transitional care and adult services that are highly focused on medication.Adult ADHD services need to undergo similar development to that experienced by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and community paediatrics over the last few decades. While we debate the relative merits of dedicated or specialist v. generic adult mental health services, for young adults with ADHD the training, experience and availability of professionals are more important than their qualifications or setting."

Incidence of focal seizures was 23.2 to 47.1 per 100,000 children per year; prevalence was 2.0 per 1,000 children, and ranged from 1.6 - 2.6 per 1,000 in patients of any age. Life expectancy was 47.3-61.8 years among children 3-12 years old. Patients took several antiepileptic drugs and experienced frequent seizures, sleep disorders, mood disorders, migraine, and seizure-related injuries (eg, bone fractures, sprains, open wounds). Children with focal seizures scored below average on cognitive assessments and up to 42%, 16%, and 19% had depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit disorder, respectively. Patients of any age had about 10 outpatient visits (2 epilepsy-related), 2 inpatient visits (less than 1 epilepsy-related), and 24 procedures (1 epilepsy-related) per year. Medication adherence was low: only half of pediatric patients maintained ≥90% adherence over 6 months.

About one in five teenage respondents to the Boston Youth Survey said they were frequently depressed. While females were more likely to report depression, males were more likely to report isolation and less likely to consider counseling. Medicaid claims data revealed differences by gender and age, with males using psychiatric emergency and Medicaid mental health services more than females, and 10- to 15-year-olds using these services more than other age groups. Emergency room injury surveillance and death certificate data indicated that among children and adolescents, females were twice as likely to attempt suicide as males, although males were more likely to complete a suicide.

Inversely, one in three (34.8%) young people reported meaningful goal progress but no reliable symptom improvement. Monitoring systems that focus exclusively on symptom change risk over- or under-estimating actual impact, while aggregating different outcomes into a single metric can mask informative differences in the number and type of outcomes showing improvement.

Twelve-month and lifetime diagnosis of abuse and dependence (cannabis, alcohol, cocaine/crack) (DSM-IV), current and lifetime mood disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and psychotic disorders were assessed (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview). Logistic regression analyses identified adjusted odds ratios associated with the gender and the health care seeking (P=0.01).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One hundred and forty-seven men (71%) and 60 women (29%), 29.3±8.6 years (15.2-51.6 years). Most of the outpatients ask for health care themselves (59.7%), whereas 19.4% are asked to seek health care by relatives (19.4%) or because of an academic, health or justice injunction (20.4%). In total, 49.3% of the outpatients are single, 35.7% are cohabitating, 9.3% are married and 6.3% are separated/divorced. About 20.4% of the outpatients are students, 35.7% have a professional activity, 19% are jobless, 2.4% are impaired, 0.5% are retired, at home and 12.1% do not have an official income. Twelve-month and lifetime prevalence of abuse/dependence are: cannabis (10.1/82.1% and 8.7/88.4%), alcohol (9.7/8.7% and 19.3/18.8%), cocaine/crack (2.4/3.4% and 4.8/11.6%). The mean duration of cannabis dependence for the current dependent users is 8.4±5.8 years. The mean number of \"joints\" during the last 6 months is 6±4.3, the mean amount of cannabis per week is 12.5±11.3g. About 51.3% of the dependent users report externalized and/or internalized disorders at school during childhood and adolescence. In total, 19.4% of the dependent users have a suicide attempt history and 18.9% have a psychiatric hospitalisation history, more frequently women (P<0.01 and P=0.02). About 73.8% have a psychologist or psychiatrist care history. In total, 38.1% of users have at least one current mood disorder, females more frequently than males (P<0.001). Current and lifetime prevalence of mood disorders are: major depressive disorder (MDD) (29.1% and 57.1%); current dysthymia (20.3%); hypomania (1.9 and 6.7%); mania (2.9 and 12.8%). Females have more frequently than males current and lifetime MDD (P<0.001). About 53.2% of users have at least one current anxiety disorder, females more frequently than males (P<0.001). Current and lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders are: panic disorder (10 and 16.4%); agoraphobia (13.9 and 17.4%); social phobia (26.9 and 32.8%); obsessive-compulsive disorder (9.5 and 12.9%); post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (6.5 and 16.4%); current generalized anxiety disorder (26.8%).

Caregivers and youths completed nomothetic (standardized checklist) and idiographic (free response) measures at intake. Irritability was identified as a top problem (TP) in 58% of cases, commonly reported by caregivers (38%), youths (42%), or both (23%)-rates that were significantly greater than those of other TP domains (depression, anxiety, ADHD, conduct, and defiance). Further analyses identified clinical correlates of irritability TPs, with results supporting the incremental utility of multiple informants and methods.

We estimated the odds of receiving professional mental health treatment in the previous year given results from different mental health screening batteries: the CES-D 10 battery for depression screening, the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders, and the Primary Care Posttraumatic Stress Disorder screen. Overall, students with higher scores on screening instruments for depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and combinations of screening instruments were more likely to have sought past-year professional mental health treatment than non-symptomatic youth. However, the proportion of students screening positive and receiving professional treatment was low, ranging from 11 to 16 %.

There is increasing evidence that psychological therapies are efficacious in treating self-harm in adolescents. However, studies so far have predominantly focused on highly selective groups of adolescents and have investigated interventions that require intensive training and considerable expense. Methods: We conducted a pilot study of a novel psychological therapy package, Specialized Therapeutic Assessment-Based Recovery-Focused Treatment (START) that consists of Therapeutic Assessment followed by treatment in one of three modules, depending on adolescents' needs and preferences: Solution Focused Brief Therapy, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), or Mentalization Based Treatment. Adolescents (12-17) with at least one self-harm episode in the previous 6 months referred for community treatment, who had no intellectual disability, psychosis or autism were eligible for START. The primary outcome measure was the number of self-harm (regardless of suicidal intent) episodes 6 months before and 6 months after commencing START. Secondary outcomes included measures of psychopathology, functional impairment and family satisfaction. Results: Twenty-one consecutively referred adolescents were recruited and 15 received a therapeutic module of START: three received Solution Focused Brief Therapy, nine CBT, and three Mentalization Based Treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in the number of self-harm episodes from a mean of 7.93 (SD = 12.26) to 1.00 (SD = 1.47), p < 0.02 following START. There was also a significant reduction in self-harm episodes, Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale scores and a statistically significant improvement in Children Global Assessment Scale scores for the CBT group alone. There were no significant differences in any other outcomes. Most families were somewhat or very much satisfied with the intervention. Conclusion: The results show that START was associated with a reduction in self-harm and depression and anxiety symptoms, which could indicate that START should be rigorously studied in a randomized control trial (RCT). However, the model had difficulties in its implementation, with CBT being only module that was offered to enough young people to allow before and after analysis. CBT appears to be the most promising module in treating adolescents with self-harm referred to community mental health services."

Results showed that SAD symptoms typically caused very little impairment but demonstrated significant continuity over time. Older youth had significantly more persistent symptoms than younger children. Prior symptom level independently predicted future symptom level and diagnostic symptom threshold, with and without impairment.

Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) could help increase accessibility but needs further rigorous assessment. We aimed to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ICBT in the treatment of paediatric anxiety disorders.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We did a single-blind randomised controlled trial in a clinical research unit within the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in Stockholm (Sweden). Eligible participants were children aged 8-12 years with a diagnosis of a principal anxiety disorder (seperation anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, or panic disorder) of at least moderate severity. We randomly allocated participants (1:1) to ICBT or internet-delivered child-directed play, an active comparator aimed to improve parent-child relationships and increase a child's self-esteem without directly targeting anxiety. Block sizes for the randomisation varied between four and six and were generated using a computer random-number generator, and the allocation was concealed from the researchers by opaque sealed envelopes. Both treatment programmes comprised 12 modules presented over 12 weeks with weekly asynchronous online therapist support, and consisted of texts, films, illustrations, and exercises. The primary outcome was severity rating of the principal anxiety disorder 12-weeks post-treatment, via the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (a rating of at least 4 corresponds to meeting the criteria for the principal diagnosis), assessed by clinicians masked to treatment allocation. All participants were included in the primary analysis (intention-to-treat).

This study assessed stigmatizing attitudes and help-seeking intentions and helpfulness beliefs via a national telephone survey of 3021 youths aged 15-25. Five stigma scales were used: social distance, personally held weak-not-sick and dangerousness beliefs, and weak-not-sick and dangerousness beliefs perceived in others. Respondents were presented with a vignette of a young person portraying depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, depression with alcohol abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia, or psychosis. Beliefs that mental illness is a sign of personal weakness and preference for social distance were associated with less intention to seek professional help and less endorsement of their helpfulness. In contrast, dangerousness/unpredictability beliefs were associated with more intention to seek professional help and more endorsement of their helpfulness.

            "abstract": "ADHD and Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a core component of paediatricians case work in the U.K. and U.S., but the situation in Ireland is less clear. Due to significant underdevelopment of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in Ireland, long waiting lists may delay identification and treatment. The aim of our study was to explore the views of a group of paediatricians in relation to their current and future practice of assessing and managing ADHD and ASD. The outcome of our study indicated that more than half of the paediatricians surveyed are directly involved in the assessment or treatment of ADHD and ASD. Eighty five per cent (85%) of paediatricians believed that they should have a role in the assessment of ADHD and ASD and over half had thought that they should be involved in managing ADHD and ASD. These results suggest that there is potential to develop alternative specialist services in Ireland for the identification and treatment of children with ADHD and ASD. The development of a well coordinated integrated care pathway may reduce waiting times for families and lead to easier access to services."

Those that have, typically combine youth with comorbid conduct problem and those with comorbid ADHD, despite likely differences in the etiology and course of these conditions. This study compared the profile of children with a primary anxiety disorder without comorbidity to those with different comorbidity profiles in a treatment-seeking sample of 111 children recruited from community mental health settings. Anxiety severity and depressive symptomatology did not vary by comorbidity profile. Anxious children without comorbidity had lower levels of attention problems, rule breaking, aggressive and externalizing behaviors compared to the comorbid ADHD and comorbid conduct problems groups, as well as lower levels of functional impairment and social problems. There were some differences in clinical phenomenology and psychosocial functioning between the comorbid ADHD and comorbid conduct problems groups, with the conduct problems group having higher levels of rule breaking, aggressive and externalizing behaviors, as well as higher levels of functional impairment, providing preliminary evidence of separate clinical profiles."

One of the most common psychiatric disorders in childhood is ADHD, with an estimated prevalence of 3-5% in Sweden. Previous studies have shown a similar prevalence of ADHD in minority and majority children in Sweden and the UK. However, clinical studies demonstrated that children from immigrant families living in Sweden received less psychiatric care than those of native-born parents. We tested the hypothesis that the consumption of child psychiatric care in immigrant families would be determined by the availability of such treatment in the parents' country of origin. Patterns of medication for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were studied as a proxy for child psychiatric care.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a register study of dispensed stimulant medication during 2013-2014 in Swedish national birth cohorts from 1995-2009. The study population, consisting of nearly 1.4 million children, was divided by national income of the parental country of origin and whether the parents were native Swedes, European immigrants, non-European immigrants or a mixture. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios of having been dispensed at least one ADHD drug during 2013, with adjustments for gender, family status indicating whether the child is living with both parents, household income and area of residence.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Having parents born in low-income (OR [95% confidence interval] 0.27 [0.24-0.29]) or middle-income (European: OR 0.23 [0.20-0.26], non-European: OR 0.39 [0.34-0.41]) countries was associated with lower ADHD treatment levels than having parents born in high-income countries (European: OR 0.60 [0.54-0.66], non-European: OR 0.68 [0.59-0.79]), when compared to children of parents born in Sweden. In families with a background in low or middle income countries, there was no significant association between household income and ADHD medication, while in children with Swedish and mixed backgrounds high level of disposable income was associated with lower levels of ADHD medication.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The use of child psychiatric care by immigrant families in Sweden was largely associated with the income level of the country of origin."

Psychosocial treatments include classroom, family, and child-focused interventions that teach caregivers and teachers how to implement contingencies to shape behavior and provide children with skills to compensate for ADHD deficits. Such programs have a growing evidence-base and can be implemented alone or in conjunction with pharmacological treatments. The most efficacious psychosocial treatments for children with ADHD include Behavioral Parent Training, Behavioral Classroom Management, and Behavioral Peer Interventions, which all focus on contingency management by adults. Training interventions are increasingly used to teach organizational and interpersonal skills to children and adolescents. These treatments are found to improve functional outcomes associated with ADHD, including on-task behavior, compliance, academic performance, social relationships, and family functioning. Clinicians play an important role in educating families about psychosocial treatments for ADHD, increasing family motivation and engagement, and including these interventions in multimodal treatment plans for youth with ADHD across development.

To identify factors associated with single and repeat visits, and the average length of time between visits. To compare the number of parent-reported visits with visits recorded in the Medicare Benefits Schedule.\n## METHOD\nThe study used data from the national survey of the mental health and wellbeing of 4-17 year olds conducted in 2013-2014 ( n = 6310). Participants were randomly selected from all 4 to 17 year olds in Australia. Information about visits was available from face-to-face interviews with parents, the Medicare Benefits Schedule and self-reports from 13 to 17 year olds. Mental disorders were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV completed by parents.\n## RESULTS\nParents reported that 51.1% of 4-17 year olds with mental disorders had attended a health professional during the previous 12 months. However, 13.6% of these children had attended on only a single occasion, most commonly with a general practitioner. With the exception of occupational therapists, 2-4 visits was the most common number of repeat visits. Children with comorbid disorders and severe functional impairment and those aged 12-17 years were more likely to have repeat visits. Among those with linked Medicare Benefits Schedule data, more children were reported by parents to have attended Medicare Benefits Schedule-funded health professionals (47.9%) than were recorded in Medicare Benefits Schedule data (38.0%).\n## CONCLUSION\nThe typical number of visits to health professionals by children with mental disorders during a 12-month period is relatively small. Furthermore, parent-reports may overestimate the number of visits during this time. It seems unlikely that current patterns of attendance are of sufficient duration and frequency to allow full implementation of evidence-based treatment programmes for child and adolescent mental disorders.\n"

Yet there is a paucity of evidence on the value of mental health programs in these contexts, and of the chronology of psychological sequelae, especially in prolonged conflicts with repeated cycles of extreme violence. Here, we describe changes in the psychological profile of new patients in a mental health program after the military offensive Cast Lead, in the context of the prolonged armed conflict involving the Gaza Strip.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study analyses routinely collected program data from a Médecins Sans Frontières mental health program in the Gaza Strip spanning 2007-2011.

Noted changes proximal to Operation Cast Lead were: a doubling in patient case load with a broader socio-economic background, shorter interval from an identified traumatic event to seeking care, and a rise in diagnoses of acute and posttraumatic stress disorders. Sustained changes included: high case load, more distal triggering events, and increase in diagnoses of other anxiety disorders (especially for children 15 years and younger) and depression (especially for patients 16 years and older).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Evolving changes in patient volume, diagnoses and recall period to triggering events suggest a lengthy and durable effect of an intensified exposure to violence in a context of prolonged conflict.

Popular culture propagates the myth that ADHD recedes with age; this is not the case. Although it is common, <20% of adults with ADHD are diagnosed or treated. Adults with ADHD show significant comorbidities with depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use, oppositional defiant disorder, personality disorders, sleep problems, and learning disabilities. However, symptoms that result from ADHD, such as mood symptoms or lability, are often mistaken for comorbid disorders. Comorbidity with ADHD impacts treatment compliance, treatment response, and patient insight. Insufficient data on the interaction between ADHD and comorbidities impedes proper diagnosis and treatment. Better clinical tools for assessing these conditions are needed. Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacologic treatments for adult ADHD include stimulants, dexmethylphenidate, and the nonstimulant atomoxetine. Effect sizes of approved medicines at approved doses are half those seen in children. Adults may also need longer duration of medication effects than children. Short-acting stimulants are likely to result in poorer adherence and have a higher risk for diversion or abuse. Risk of abuse is a major concern; stimulant treatments are controlled substances, and children with ADHD show increased risk of substance abuse. Psychosocial interventions may be beneficial in treating both ADHD and comorbidities.In this expert roundtable supplement, Margaret Weiss, MD, PhD, presents a comprehensive overview of complications surrounding differential diagnosis in adults with ADHD. Next, Mark A. Stein, PhD, reviews evaluation, comorbidity, and development of a treatment plan in this population. Finally, Jeffrey H. Newcorn, MD, provides a discussion on the pharmacologic options available for adults with ADHD, considering dosages specific to adults and common comorbidities."

            "abstract": "Recent research has examined the contribution of parental anxiety sensitivity to child anxiety, suggesting only a modest relationship between these two variables. No study to date, however, has examined the role of parental anxiety sensitivity in parent reports of the child's anxiety. It was hypothesized that anxiety sensitivity, a cognitive risk factor for the development of anxiety, would be significantly correlated with parents' reports of their child's anxiety, specifically with respect to panic and separation anxiety. The present study employed a sample of 56 treatment-seeking children and their parents. Parent and child reports of the child's anxiety were obtained, and self-reports of anxiety sensitivity were obtained from parent and child. Parent reports of their child's panic and separation anxiety symptoms were significantly related to not only parental anxiety sensitivity (r = .39 and r = .29, respectively) but also the child's self-reported level of anxiety sensitivity (r = .35 and r = .37, respectively). These findings suggest that anxiety sensitivity, a significant predictor of panic symptomatology amongst both adults and children, might be related to parents' perceptions of their child's symptoms of panic and separation anxiety. These findings further suggest taking into consideration parental levels of anxiety sensitivity when interpreting parent reports of child anxiety in clinical settings."

The current study was performed using data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment claims database from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2013. Our study sample consisted of 10,343 children and adolescents with ADHD who were not given their newly prescribed medication in 360 days before the initial claim in 2010. Data were followed up from the initiation of treatment with ADHD medications in 2010 to December 31, 2013. Discontinuation rates for 4 ADHD medications in our sample ranged from 97.7% for immediate-release methylphenidate to 99.4% for atomoxetine using refill gap more than 30 days and from 56.7% for immediate-release methylphenidate to 62.3% for extended-release methylphenidate using refill gap more than 60 days. In the number of discontinued, we found significant differences among medications using refill gap more than 30 days. Among 4 ADHD medications, extended-release methylphenidate and atomoxetine had more days than immediate-release methylphenidate and osmotic-controlled oral delivery system methylphenidate. In logistic regression analyses, extended-release methylphenidate, osmotic-controlled oral delivery system methylphenidate, and atomoxetine showed less discontinuation compared to immediate-release methylphenidate group when a refill gap more than 30 days was used. In logistic regression analysis of adherence, we could not find any differences among 4 medication types. We suggest that the utilization patterns should be assessed regularly in order to improve future outcomes in children and adolescents with ADHD."

Many are instead seeking support and information regarding their mental health via the Web, especially via social networking sites (SNSs), and hence, there is a promising opportunity to use SNSs to deliver or integrate with youth-focused online mental health interventions. Previous reviews have evaluated the effectiveness of SNSs for specific disorders in young people; however, none of the reviews have covered the breadth of SNS-based youth mental health interventions available across all mental health issues.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This review aimed to systematically identify available evidence regarding the use of SNS-based interventions to support the mental health of young people aged up to 25 years, to evaluate their effectiveness, suitability, and safety, and identify gaps and opportunities for future research.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched using Medical Subject Headings terms and exploded keywords and phrases. Retrieved abstracts (n=974) were double screened, yielding 235 articles for screening at the full-text level. Of these, 9 articles met the review inclusion criteria. Given the small number of studies, and the variety of outcome measures used, a quantitative meta-analysis was not possible.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The 9 articles (quantitative studies, qualitative studies, and descriptions of the iterative design process) covered 5 separate interventions. Of the 5 interventions, 2 interventions used purpose-built platforms based on the moderated online social therapy (MOST) model, 2 used Facebook, and 1 evaluated a purpose-built mobile app. The 2 MOST interventions targeted specific mental health issues (depression and psychosis), whereas the others focused on improving mental health literacy, social support, and general well-being. Only 3 quantitative studies were identified, and all used a pre-post design (without a control group) to establish proof of concept. Of the outcome variables assessed, there were significant improvements in mental health knowledge and number of depressive symptoms but no improvement in anxiety or psychosis symptoms. Acceptability of and engagement with the SNS platforms were generally high, as were perceptions of usefulness and safety. Moderation by clinical experts was identified as a key component of the more successful interventions. When offered a choice, users showed a preference for mobile apps over Web-based interfaces.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The evidence reviewed suggests young people find SNS-based interventions highly usable, engaging, and supportive. However, future studies need to address the current lack of high-quality evidence for their efficacy in reducing mental health symptoms. Given young people are already turning to SNSs to engage in knowledge seeking and peer-to-peer support, SNS-based youth mental health interventions provide an opportunity to address some of the barriers young people face in accessing qualified mental health support and information."

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is leading to mental health problems due to disease experience, physical distancing, stigma and discrimination, and job losses in many of the settings hardest hit by the pandemic. Health care workers, patients with COVID-19 and other illnesses, children, women, youth, and the elderly are experiencing post-traumatic stress disorders, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Virtual mental health services have been established in many settings and social media is being used to impart mental health education and communication resources. This rapid review highlights mental health services across countries hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. More needs to be done to take these services to scale and ensure equity and efficiency. The impact of COVID-19 on mental health in sub-Saharan Africa could be immense, given the weak health care systems. Similar to the Ebola epidemic of 2014-2016, COVID-19 is expected to cause anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorders. Uptake of mental health care services is generally low, and communities rely on social resources. Hence, efforts to control the disease transmission should be contextualized. Low digital literacy, low smartphone penetration and limited internet connection make online mental health services a limited option for service delivery. Safeguarding social and cultural resilience factors and coping mechanisms is critical in the sub-Saharan African context. Mass media is a feasible way of providing social resources. Community health workers can be trained quickly to provide mental health education, screening and counselling services. Toll-free mental health helplines can be used to provide services to health care workers and those needing customized care. Mental health and psychosocial support services need to be integrated into the pandemic response and coordinated nationally. It is critical for these services to continue during and after the epidemic."

Drumming is a non-verbal, universal activity that builds upon a collectivistic aspect of diverse cultures and does not bear the stigma of therapy. A pretest-post-test non-equivalent control group design was used to assess the effects of 12 weeks of school counselor-led drumming on social-emotional behavior in two fifth-grade intervention classrooms versus two standard education control classrooms. The weekly intervention integrated rhythmic and group counseling activities to build skills, such as emotion management, focus and listening. The Teacher's Report Form was used to assess each of 101 participants (n = 54 experimental, n = 47 control, 90% Latino, 53.5% female, mean age 10.5 years, range 10-12 years). There was 100% retention. ANOVA testing showed that intervention classrooms improved significantly compared to the control group in broad-band scales (total problems (P < .01), internalizing problems (P < .02)), narrow-band syndrome scales (withdrawn/depression (P < .02), attention problems (P < .01), inattention subscale (P < .001)), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-oriented scales (anxiety problems (P < .01), attention deficit/hyperactivity problems (P < .01), inattention subscale (P < .001), oppositional defiant problems (P < .03)), and other scales (post-traumatic stress problems (P < .01), sluggish cognitive tempo (P < .001)). Participation in group drumming led to significant improvements in multiple domains of social-emotional behavior. This sustainable intervention can foster positive youth development and increase student-counselor interaction. These findings underscore the potential value of the arts as a therapeutic tool."

It is generally assumed that DHIs will be preferred by children and young people (CYP) given their ubiquitous digital activity. However, it remains uncertain whether: DHIs for CYP are clinically and cost-effective, CYP prefer DHIs to traditional services, DHIs widen access and how they should be evaluated and adopted by mental health services. This review evaluates the evidence-base for DHIs and considers the key research questions and approaches to evaluation and implementation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a meta-review of scoping, narrative, systematic or meta-analytical reviews investigating the effectiveness of DHIs for mental health problems in CYP.

The therapy was conducted over four weeks and was supplemented with brief, weekly videoconference calls with a therapist. A non-concurrent multiple baseline design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment in a sample of seven children between four and seven years of age. Significant reductions in specific phobia diagnostic severity, parent and child fear ratings, and child avoidance during a behavioral approach task were all observed. Additionally, treatment adherence, retention, and satisfaction were all high. Future research is needed to replicate the findings in larger, more heterogeneous samples and to explore possible predictive variables; however, this study provides initial support for bibliotherapy as a non-intensive, first-line intervention for specific phobias in young children."

            "abstract": "While attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been extensively studied in the past decades, the role of social and cultural practices in its assessment, diagnosis, and treatment has been often overlooked. This selective review provides an overview of research that explores social and cultural influences on help-seeking behavior in ethnic minority children with ADHD. Studies were selected that address cultural diversity in three areas of ADHD help-seeking: problem recognition, access to mental health services, and treatment. Special attention was given to studies of treatment selection and adherence in minority groups. Findings suggested that cultural disparities in ADHD care among ethnic minority children occur in the early stages of problem recognition, through service selection, and in the quality of treatment. Ethnic minority children were less likely than their nonminority counterparts to be diagnosed with ADHD and its comorbid conditions and less likely to be prescribed and adhere to stimulant drug treatment. These differences reflect cultural diversity in norms and attitudes towards mental health issues (e.g., fear of social stigma) as well as limited access to qualified health care. Paradoxically, cultural, racial, and language bias may also lead to the overidentification of ethnic minority children as disabled and to higher ratings of ADHD symptoms. This review highlights the importance of sociocultural factors in understanding developmental psychopathology and help-seeking behavior. In addition, it further supports calls for increasing cultural competence in communications during clinical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment in minority communities. Clinical, theoretical, and methodological considerations for future research are discussed."

There is insufficient knowledge about sleep among adolescents within child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in comparison to the general population. The data are drawn from the youth@hordaland study, a large population-based study conducted in 2012, linked to the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR) (n = 9077). Psychiatric disorders were based on clinical diagnoses from the NPR, while insomnia, delayed sleep-wake-phase disorder (DSWPD), and other sleep problems/patterns were assessed by self-report questionnaires from youth@hordaland. The prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders among adolescents seeking mental health services was 0.6%, yielding an estimated prevalence of 0.07% of the population. However, questionnaire-based measurement of insomnia from the youth@hordaland study indicated that insomnia was highly prevalent across disorders in comparison to a reference group of adolescents who were not within mental health care. Insomnia ranged from 29% among adolescents diagnosed with ADHD (PR = 1.79; 95% CI 1.41-2.29) to 48% among adolescents diagnosed with depression (PR = 2.53, 95% CI 2.19-2.92). All diagnostic groups had a mean sleep efficiency below (85%), indicating poor sleep quality. Insomnia, delayed sleep-phase wake disorder, and poor sleep efficiency were confirmed as transdiagnostic sleep problems across psychiatric disorders. In addition, some disorder-specific patterns emerged, such as a higher prevalence of insomnia among adolescents with depression, and DSWPS among adolescents with conduct disorder. This underscores the need for treating sleep problems in CAMHS, and transdiagnostic treatment approaches are warranted."

Because of their wide range of clinical presentation and comorbidity with other disorders such as depression, they are frequently under-recognized. These factors, coupled with lack of physician confidence in their ability to treat these conditions, leads to under-treatment. Treatment of anxiety disorders is further complicated by a significant lag time between first onset and initial contact with a treatment provider. Even for those anxiety disorders characterized by relatively early treatment contact (i.e. panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder), <50% of patients are treated at first onset of symptoms. Following treatment, approximately 50% of patients significantly improve over 6-16 months, but complete recovery is uncommon. To help remedy this situation, the British Association for Pharmacology (BAP) has issued comprehensive evidence-based guidelines (developed from a consensus meeting 20-21 May 2004 involving clinical experts and representatives of user groups) to aid clinicians in diagnosing and treating anxiety disorders. The guidelines focus on pharmacological interventions for all primary anxiety disorders in adults (18-65 years), and are intended for doctors in primary care, as well as specialist practice. Importantly, the guidelines cover the difficult topic of treatment non-response. The BAP guidelines link treatment recommendations with quality of evidence, allowing clinicians to judge the confidence they might place in particular recommendations."

Study participants were 573 veterinary medical students currently enrolled in accredited programs in the United States. Participants reported being most willing to seek mental health services for issues regarding substance abuse, traumatic experiences, and anxiety. They also tended to perceive other students were less willing to seek mental health services for most presenting issues than they actually were. As expected, self-stigma and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help serially mediated the relationship between public stigma and willingness to seek mental health services. Public stigma was positively related to self-stigma, self-stigma was negatively related to attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help, and attitudes toward seeking help were positively related to willingness to seek mental health services.

The current report expands those previous findings to the 20 nationally or regionally representative WMH surveys that have now collected data on adult ADHD. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was administered to 26,744 respondents in these surveys in high-, upper-middle-, and low-/lower-middle-income countries (68.5% mean response rate). Current DSM-IV/CIDI adult ADHD prevalence averaged 2.8% across surveys and was higher in high (3.6%)- and upper-middle (3.0%)- than low-/lower-middle (1.4%)-income countries. Conditional prevalence of current ADHD averaged 57.0% among childhood cases and 41.1% among childhood subthreshold cases. Adult ADHD was significantly related to being male, previously married, and low education. Adult ADHD was highly comorbid with DSM-IV/CIDI anxiety, mood, behavior, and substance disorders and significantly associated with role impairments (days out of role, impaired cognition, and social interactions) when controlling for comorbidities. Treatment seeking was low in all countries and targeted largely to comorbid conditions rather than to ADHD. These results show that adult ADHD is prevalent, seriously impairing, and highly comorbid but vastly under-recognized and undertreated across countries and cultures."

            "abstract": "Depression and suicidal ideation have substantially increased among college students, yet many students with clinically significant symptoms do not perceive their distress as warranting mental health services. Personalized feedback (PF) interventions deliver objective data, often electronically, comparing an individual's reported symptoms or behaviors to a group norm. Several studies have shown promise for PF interventions in the context of mood and depression, yet little is known regarding how, and for whom, mood-focused PF interventions might be best deployed. The primary aim of this study was to examine the sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment-seeking factors associated with reviewing PF reports on emotional distress among college students (N = 1,673) screening positive for elevated suicide risk and not receiving mental health treatment. Results indicated that PF engagement was greatest among those with higher depression scores, and those reporting privacy/stigma concerns as barriers to treatment. Sexual minority students were more likely to review their PF than heterosexual students. Taken together, PF interventions may be a useful tool for engaging those with greater clinical acuity, and those hesitant to seek in-person care. Further research is warranted to examine the circumstances in which PF interventions might be used in isolation, or as part of a multitiered intervention strategy."

Studies show that mothers of adolescents belonging to the Arab minority have much lower help-seeking rates than Jewish mothers. This paper examines mothers' structural and cultural barriers to help-seeking.\n## METHODS\nAll 9th grade students living in 5 towns representative of Muslim and Druze localities in northern Israel, were eligible for the study and 1639 (69.3%) obtained parental agreement and participated. Emotional or behavioral problem were assessed in the classroom using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. A total of 704 adolescent-mother dyads participated in the follow-up, and were interviewed at home, using the Development and Well Being Assessment inventory, the Composite Barriers to Help-Seeking Questionnaire, the General Health Questionnaire - 12, the Subjective Feelings of Discrimination Index and socio-demographic questions.

Cultural barriers such as stigma were considered of secondary importance. Structural barriers could be reduced by increasing the number of accessible public mental health clinics in the minority localities, a responsibility of the Ministry of Health and the HMOs. Information campaigns and psychoeducation for parents would help reduce other barriers to mental health treatment.\n"

            "abstract": "The link between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use disorders (SUDs) has been largely demonstrated. Some scholars have hypothesized that self-regulation mechanisms might play a key role in explaining this association. Objective(s): The current study tested the hypothesis that retrospective childhood ADHD symptoms might lead to more severe SUDs and this association should be mediated by current self-ratings of behavioral disinhibition, inattention, and emotional dysregulation among 204 treatment-seeking adults (male: 67.3%; female: 32.7%) with a primary diagnosis of alcohol use disorder and other SUDs. Methods: The mediational model was estimated through self-report measures of childhood ADHD symptoms (independent variable; WURS), current self-regulation mechanisms (mediators)-behavioral disinhibition (BIS-11 motor subscale), difficulties with attention regulation (MAAS) and emotion regulation (DERS)-and severity of SUDs (dependent variable; SPQ alcohol, illicit and prescribed drugs). Results: The analysis showed that alterations in the self-regulation system fully mediated the association between the severity of childhood ADHD symptoms and SUDs in adulthood. Behavioral disinhibition and difficulties in attention regulation were the most representative alterations in self-regulation processes that explained this association. Conclusions: These findings suggest it is useful to implement several therapeutic approaches (e.g. behavioral, mindfulness-based, and pharmacological) to increase the self-regulation abilities of children and adolescents with ADHD in order to reduce the probability of SUD onset in adulthood. However, future longitudinal neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies are needed to further support the role of self-regulation mechanisms in explaining the prospective association between childhood ADHD symptoms and SUDs in adulthood."

            "abstract": "Pediatricians understand their role as promoting both the physical and mental health of children from birth until adulthood. Within the context of this long-term relationship, parents approach clinicians to address a full range of behavioral concerns ranging from variations of normal development to major mental illness. In this commentary that builds upon the earlier manuscripts in this collection, we explore the pediatrician's role in mental health care through the example of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD is an ideal prototype for the exploration of partnership in mental health care because ADHD is the most common neurobehavioral disorder in childhood, it is commonly treated in primary care settings, multiple evidence-based treatments exist, personal values strongly influence the acceptability of treatment, treatment adherence is often poor, and effective treatment relies on the collaboration of pediatricians with families, schools, and the mental health system. Through the use of the Chronic Care Model for Child Health that emphasizes the importance of optimizing and coordinating systems of care for effective partnership, the following manuscript reviews the challenges and opportunities for pediatricians partnering with families and schools to address mental health problems. Strategies highlighted in the preceding papers are discussed within the context of this model."

            "abstract": "Although a host of evidence-based treatments exist for youth with anxiety disorders, less than 30% of youth and their families receive these treatments. One of the main barriers to receiving these treatments is the lack of access to care, due largely to the absence of mental health professionals who have expertise in the delivery of these treatments in certain geographic locales. The current study examined whether a brief intensive treatment for specific phobias (SPs), Augmented One-Session Treatment (OST-A), would result in comparable treatment gains for families who traveled a considerable distance to receive this treatment when compared to families who resided in our local community. Participants included 76 youth with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of SP (38 local families and an age- and sex-matched sample of 38 nonlocal families). Although SP severity at pretreatment was significantly greater for the nonlocal youth than the local youth, both nonlocal and local youth showed commensurate improvement and maintenance of treatment gains over a 6-month period across several clinical outcome measures. Findings from this study show that OST-A is effective when families choose to travel for treatment, addressing at least one of the barriers to use of this evidence-based treatment."

However, treatment rates for anxiety are very low, causing a sizeable treatment gap. There is an immediate need to identify treatment interventions that are effective, affordable, and can be delivered easily to the youth population. Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) is one potentially effective intervention that could reach youth on a large scale, especially when self-administered at home. Thus, we aim to assess the benefit of CBM to treat youth anxiety. Further, we aim to test whether adding an adherence promotion (AP) component to the CBM intervention can improve outcomes, and whether CBM delivered both with and without the AP component is cost effective.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This is a 12-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted within an existing healthcare system.

We aim to enroll 498 participants and randomize them 1:1:1 to one of three arms: Arm 1 is a Low-Ratio version of the CBM program (nearly identical to the other CBM versions, but minimally effective); Arm 2 is a High-Ratio \"active\" CBM program; and Arm 3 is the High-Ratio CBM program with an added AP component. Participants will complete assessments at baseline, 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months post-baseline. Youth in all three arms will self-administer the CBM program at home and will be asked to complete twelve intervention sessions over a four-week period.

Using a district-wide stratified random sample of 1615 elementary school students screened for ADHD risk, predictors of 4 help-seeking steps among a high-risk group (n = 389) and parent-identified barriers to care among children with unmet need for ADHD care (n = 91) were assessed. Study findings indicate that although 88% of children were recognized as having a problem, only 39% had been evaluated, 32% received an ADHD diagnosis, and 23% received current treatment. Older children and those with more severe behavior problems were more likely to be perceived by their parents as having a problem. Additionally, gender and ethnic disparities in the subsequent help-seeking process emerged. Boys had over 5 times the odds than girls of receiving an evaluation, an ADHD diagnosis, and treatment. Compared to African American youth, Caucasian children had twice the odds of taking these help-seeking steps. For those children with unmet need for ADHD care, poverty predicted lower treatment rates and was associated with the most pervasive barriers. The gap between parental problem recognition and seeking services suggests that thresholds for parental recognition of a child behavior problem and for seeking ADHD services may be different. Future research examining the help-seeking process for ADHD should include a qualitative component to explore the potential mechanisms for gender and ethnic differences.\n"

Despite an increasing prevalence of chronic childhood conditions and heightened concerns for the quality of life of the chronically ill, population-based studies of behavior problems among children with chronic physical conditions are rare. Findings on the epidemiology of behavior problems in a nationally representative sample of 11,699 children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years in the United States are reported. Data included a 32-item parent-reported behavior problem index, measures of chronic childhood conditions, measures of school placement and performance, and sociodemographic variables. Analyses confirmed that chronic physical conditions were a significant risk factor for behavior problems, independent of sociodemographic variables. Among children these differences were observed across all subscales; among adolescents the largest differences were found for the Depression/Anxiety and Peer Conflict/Social Withdrawal subscales. Rates of extreme behavior problem scores (those in the top 10th percentile) were 1.55 times higher among children with a chronic health condition compared with children without a chronic condition (95% confidence interval 1.29 to 1.86). These independent odds were lowered to 1.44 when covariates for confounding were introduced via a multivariate logistic regression.

Chronic health conditions were also a major risk factor for placement in special education classes and having to repeat grades.

The questionnaire can support the diagnostic classification, measure symptom-load and evaluate outcome of treatment of ADHD."

            "abstract": "More than 10% of fathers experience depression and anxiety during the perinatal period, but paternal perinatal depression (PPND) and anxiety have received less attention than maternal perinatal mental health problems. Few mainstream treatment options are available for men with PPND and anxiety. The aim of this literature review was to summarize the current understanding of PPND and the treatment programs specifically designed for fathers with perinatal depression. Eight electronic databases were searched using a predefined strategy, and reference lists were also hand searched. PPND and anxiety were identified to have a negative impact on family relationships, as well as the health of mothers and children. Evidence suggests a lack of support and tailored treatment options for men having trouble adjusting to the transition to fatherhood. Of the limited options available, cognitive behavioral therapy, group work, and blended delivery programs, including e-support approaches appear to be most effective in helping fathers with perinatal depression and anxiety. The review findings have important implications for the understanding of PPND and anxiety. Future research is needed to address the adoption of father-inclusive and father-specific models of care to encourage fathers' help-seeking behavior. Inclusion of male-specific requirements into support and treatment options can improve the ability of services to engage new fathers. Psychotherapeutic intervention could assist to address the cognitive differences and dissonance for men adjusting to the role of father, including male identity and role expectations."

Youth suicide rates declined gradually over the past two decades, but it is alarming to see that self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and attempts are quite common among junior secondary students. Local studies identify psychopathology (especially depression) and family relationship issues as the most common risk factors of suicide and self-harm, and impulsive control issues are an additional factor contributing to self-harm. In the second part, this paper reviews the evidence for six types of universal and selective prevention strategies identified from local and overseas literature: (1) restriction of access to means of suicide; (2) guidelines for responsible media reporting of suicides; (3) provision of quality mental healthcare to at-risk populations; (4) school-based screening and prevention programs; (5) online prevention, monitoring, and support programs; and (6) life skills training programs. Research evidence supports that the provision of high-quality mental health services to at-risk populations and some school-based prevention programs (awareness and screening, and gatekeeper training) are effective in suicide prevention. Further research efforts are needed to verify the impact of the other four strategies. Practitioners could make better use of new prevention programs through the internet and instant messaging platforms, which have the potential to alter attitude toward suicide and self-harm as well as promoting help seeking behavior among young people."

In states that granted access to Medicaid, the increase was driven by an increase in public insurance take-up. Where public coverage was not available, DACA eligibility increased individually purchased insurance. Despite the increase in insurance coverage, we find small or non-significant increases in health care use. There is some evidence that DACA increased demand for mental health services. After 2012, DACA-eligible individuals were also more likely to report a usual place of care and less likely to delay care because of financial restrictions.

Hyperactivity has been reported to decrease during transition into adulthood, although some motor dysfunction might persist. As one underlying neurophysiological process, a development-dependent normalization of motor cortical excitability might be postulated. In order to test this hypothesis, we measured the iSP in 21 adult ADHD patients and twenty-one sex- and age-matched healthy controls. In 16 of these patients, a second TMS was performed under treatment with MPH. Our results indicate a persistence of impaired transcallosally mediated motor cortical inhibition (shortened duration) in ADHD adults, which was correlated with clinical characteristics of hyperactivity and restlessness, and was restored by MPH. In contrast to ADHD in childhood, the iSP latency was not impaired, suggesting a partial development-dependent normalization of motor cortical excitability in ADHD adults.

Logistic regression results show children's likelihood of being bullied to be associated positively with racial discrimination; child mental health problem (either attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety, behavioral/conduct problem, or Tourette Syndrome); family substance use; being female; being age 6-10; being age 11-13; and parent education level. Likelihood of being bullied was associated negatively with safe neighborhood; being Black; being Asian; family cohesiveness; neighbor support; parent mental health; being a first- or second-generation immigrant; and parent age. The results imply the usefulness of interventions promoting racial harmony and family support."

The objectives of this investigation were to examine the rates and sociodemographic correlates of lifetime mental health service use by severity, type, and number of DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement.\n## METHOD\nFace-to-face survey of mental disorders from 2002 to 2004 using a modified version of the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview in a nationally representative sample of 6,483 adolescents 13 to 18 years old for whom information on service use was available from an adolescent and a parent report. Total and sector-specific mental health service use was also assessed.\n## RESULTS\nApproximately one third of adolescents with mental disorders received services for their illness (36.2%). Although disorder severity was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of receiving treatment, half of adolescents with severely impairing mental disorders had never received mental health treatment for their symptoms. Service rates were highest in those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (59.8%) and behavior disorders (45.4%), but fewer than one in five affected adolescents received services for anxiety, eating, or substance use disorders. Comorbidity and severe impairment were strongly associated with service utilization, particularly in youth with behavior disorders. Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black adolescents were less likely than their White counterparts to receive services for mood and anxiety disorders, even when such disorders were associated with severe impairment.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDespite advances in public awareness of mental disorders in youth, a substantial proportion of young people with severe mental disorders have never received specialty mental health care. Marked racial disparities in lifetime rates of mental health treatment highlight the urgent need to identify and combat barriers to the recognition and treatment of these conditions.\n"

Thus, health services are faced with a new challenge in providing a 'smooth' transition to adult services appropriate for young people with ADHD. This scoping review sought to identify the literature addressing transition for young people with ADHD to adult mental health services (AMHS). A scoping review, in which the search terms 'ADHD' and 'Transition' or 'Transfer' were entered into eight healthcare publication databases facilitated by NHS Evidence to identify both published and unpublished papers between 2000 and June 2013. Additional informal searches were also undertaken. Twenty-three papers were selected for this review. This review confirms the lack of research explicitly tracking transition from Paediatrics/Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) to AMHS for young people with ADHD. Only four papers directly studying transition for ADHD patients were identified. Three further studies surveyed clinician perspectives. Taken together, the studies address a number of issues in relation to transition, including the developmental course of ADHD symptoms, appropriate adult care, knowledge and communication, unmet need, comorbidities, environmental demands and medication cessation/dosage during the transition period. While literature surrounding transition exists, the scope of the evidence showing successful and unsuccessful transition activity from Paediatric and CAMHS to AMHS for young people with ADHD is limited. Future quality research in the form of audits, longitudinal tracking studies and service evaluations are required if we are truly to understand and identify what is needed and currently available for successful transition to an appropriate adult service for ADHD patients."

This study utilized mediation and moderation models to elucidate the nature of risk factors for suicide by examining the effect emotion dysregulation (of anger, sadness, and worry) has on the relation between ADHD symptoms (hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention) and suicidal outcomes (suicidal behavior and risk for suicide) in children ages 6 to 12. When accounting for sex, age, depressive symptoms, and emotion dysregulation, hyperactivity/impulsivity was positively associated with suicidal behavior; however, inattention was negatively associated with suicidal behavior. After accounting for the variance associated with sex, age, and depressive symptoms, two interaction effects were evident. At low levels of sadness and worry dysregulation, hyperactivity was positively associated with suicide risk. However, at high levels of sadness and worry dysregulation, hyperactivity was not related to suicide risk. Findings support moderation over mediation."

Despite this high burden, adolescents and young adults are the least likely population group to seek help or to access professional care for mental health problems. This issue is particularly problematic given that untreated, or poorly treated, mental disorders are associated with both short- and long-term functional impairment, including poorer education and employment opportunities, potential comorbidity, including drug and alcohol problems, and a greater risk for antisocial behavior, including violence and aggression. This cycle of poor mental health creates a significant burden for the young person, their family and friends, and society as a whole. Australia is enviably positioned to substantially enhance the well-being of young people, to improve their engagement with mental health services, and - ultimately - to improve mental health.

From multivariate models, service use was higher in sole carer families, but also among those living in the least socially and economically disadvantaged compared to the most disadvantaged areas.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Rates of service use for mental disorders in Australia's children and adolescents appear to have increased substantially.

Data were returned for 2358 inpatients (response rate, 65%) and 23,167 outpatients (response rate, 60%). Substance use was measured based on substance use disorder diagnosis or reported substance use in the last 4 weeks (alcohol 2-4 days a week or more frequently/illicit drug use).

Among inpatients, the prevalence of substance use was highest in patients with schizophrenia, personality disorders and anxiety disorders. Among outpatients, the prevalence was highest in patients with schizophrenia and other psychoses. Inpatients with anxiety disorders and outpatients with schizophrenia and other psychoses had a significantly higher risk of substance use than other patients. In both samples, the prevalence of substance use was higher among males, 24 to 29-year-olds and the most socially deprived.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study provides further knowledge about patients at risk for co-morbid substance abuse and poor treatment outcomes.

The concept's applicability to young people's mental health experience has been neglected, and no measures yet exist. Aim The aim of this work is to develop measures of recovery for use in specialist child and adolescent mental health services.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      On the basis of 21 semi-structured interviews, three recovery measures were devised, one for completion by the young person and two for completion by the parent/carer. Two parent/carer measures were devised in order to assess both their perspective on their child's recovery and their own recovery process. The questionnaires were administered to a UK sample of 47 young people (10-18 years old) with anxiety and depression and their parents, along with a measure used to routinely assess treatment progress and outcome and a measure of self-esteem.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All three measures had high internal consistency (alpha ≥ 0.89). Young people's recovery scores were correlated negatively with scores on a measure used to routinely assess treatment progress and outcome (r = -0.75) and positively with self-esteem (r = 0.84). Parent and young persons' reports of the young person's recovery were positively correlated (r = 0.61).

The measures provide a novel way of capturing the parental/caregiver perspective on recovery and caregivers' own wellbeing.\n    \n\n\n          Key practitioner message:\n        \n      \n      No tools exist to evaluate recovery-relevant processes in young people treated in specialist mental health services. This study reports on the development and psychometric evaluation of three self-report recovery-relevant assessments for young people and their caregivers. Findings indicate a high degree of correspondence between young person and caregiver reports of recovery in the former. The recovery assessments correlate inversely with a standardized symptom-focused measure and positively with self-esteem."

Given the association between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and poor health, the goal of this study was to examine the contribution of ACEs in undergraduates to seeking help for problems related to health. An online survey of students (N = 321, 76% female, 72% Caucasian) in a large public university showed that respondents with more ACEs were more likely to seek help, including both professional and informal types of help. However, they were less likely to find interventions helpful and more likely to quit prematurely. Common reasons for seeking help were anxiety, stress, and depression, with depression more prevalent in the high-ACEs group. More ACEs were associated with more unmet needs and greater likelihood of obtaining health information from school, another professional, or the media. More research is needed on how to harness the power of informal sources of help to improve the health of students with more ACEs, how to tailor health-related messages to fit their needs, and why students with more ACEs find interventions less helpful. Finally results suggest that ACEs shape not only lifelong health but also behaviors related to seeking help in young adults."

Such patients commonly present with physical symptoms suggestive of systemic diseases but examination and investigations often fail to substantiate organic basis of these so-called unexplained somatic symptoms (USSs). Several studies have shown that patients with USSs suffer from anxiety and depression. But these USSs are mostly misinterpreted or ignored by clinicians resulting in poor rates of diagnosis. The study objective was to devise algorithm for better and early diagnosis of. mental diseases in a specialist clinic practice setting. Common USSs were interpreted as regards their symptom-correlates both physical and mental and documented while taking detailed history, physical examination and needed investigations to diagnose systemic diseases. The study was in phases during three years and included 1297 patients in four cohorts which included one group of 154 patients with common USSs, treated with long term antidepressants. Data of all patients were recorded in microsoft excel spread-sheets for analysis. Commonest presenting USSs were so-called \"gas\", \"acidity\" and \"dysentery\" expressed in vernacular terms.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be treated with stimulant medication such as methylphenidate. Although effective, methylphenidate can cause serious side-effects, including suppressed appetite, growth retardation and sleep problems. A drug holiday is a deliberate interruption of pharmacotherapy for a defined period of time and for a specific clinical purpose, for example for appeasing side-effects. While some international guidelines recommend introducing drug holidays in ADHD treatment, this is not practised routinely. Our aim was to examine the views and experiences of planned drug holidays from methylphenidate with adults who have responsibility for treatment decisions in children and adolescents with ADHD.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      In-depth interviews were carried out. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services practitioners (n = 8), General practitioners (n = 8), teachers (n = 5) and mothers of children with ADHD (n = 4) were interviewed in a UK setting. Interview transcripts were analysed using grounded theory.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Methylphenidate eases the experience of the child amid problems at home and at school and once started is mostly continued long term. Some families do practise short-term drug holidays at weekends and longer term ones during school holidays. The decision to introduce drug holidays is influenced by the child's academic progress, the parents' ability to cope with the child, as well as medication beliefs. Trialling a drug holiday is thought to allow older children to self-assess their ability to manage without medication when they show signs of wanting to discontinue treatment prematurely.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Planned drug holidays could address premature treatment cessation by enabling adolescents to assess repercussions under medical supervision."

Initial diagnostic assessments of 49 adolescent-caregiver dyads seeking treatment at an urban pediatric hospital eating disorder clinic were utilized to examine differences between youth and caregiver reports of youth anxiety and depression symptoms. Caregivers reported significantly higher scores of major depression and generalized anxiety than adolescents (p=.000). Caregivers of youth with more severe ED symptoms exhibited more congruence with youth's own reports of their depression and anxiety. Our results suggest that agreement within families regarding comorbid psychological concerns may be beneficial in promoting treatment uptake for those who desire a reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms, regardless of motivation to change eating behaviors."

Participants included children and adolescents seeking treatment at a university-based research clinic. One group was comprised of 28 children (ages 10-17 years) who met diagnostic criteria for OCD but had no comorbid depressive disorders, whereas the second group consisted of 28 children matched for age and gender who met diagnostic criteria for OCD and co-occurring depressive disorder. The two groups were compared on measures of broad-band psychopathology, internalizing problems, social difficulties, and family characteristics. As anticipated, findings revealed comorbid depression and OCD was associated with more severe internalizing problems, more extensive obsessive-compulsive symptomatology, and more social problems. Youth with comorbid depression and OCD also had higher family conflict and lower family organization compared to those with OCD and no depression.

Furthermore, individuals with cannabis dependence have high rates of comorbid substance use disorders and depression. A significant proportion of individuals with addictive disorders develop withdrawal symptoms, cannot control their drug use despite substantial adverse psychosocial consequences, and frequently have a coexisting psychiatric disorder. Nevertheless, only a minority of persons with cannabis dependence ever seek treatment. We were unable to locate epidemiological reports regarding treatment seeking behavior among persons with cannabis dependence. Epidemiological studies of populations with substance disorders have observed that employment, higher educational level, previous use of treatment, major depression, and a co-occurring substance dependency increased the probability of seeking treatment for alcohol dependence. Thus we hypothesized that the same variables would predict service use among persons with cannabis dependence. The main findings of this study were that persons with cannabis dependence were more likely to contact a professional during the past year if they previously sought treatment and had alcohol dependence with major depression. Prospective, longitudinal studies of adolescents would increase our understanding of the processes by which individuals identify themselves as having problems related to their habitual use of marijuana, and why some seek help while others do not."

Subjects with childhood ADHD were likely to be male (78%), meet Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for conduct disorder (93%) and antisocial personality disorder (47%), and report a history of conduct disorder in first-degree relatives. With respect to those without the disorder and regardless of co-occurrence with sociopathy, cocaine abusers with childhood ADHD were younger at presentation for treatment and reported more severe substance use, earlier onset of cocaine abuse, more frequent and intense cocaine use, intranasal rather than freebase or intravenous use of cocaine, higher rates of alcoholism, and more previous treatment. This pattern of cocaine use is consistent with clinical descriptions of self-medication of residual symptoms of ADHD in cocaine abusers. Data from this study suggest that there may be more cocaine abusers with a history of ADHD than previously recognized in clinical samples of cocaine users, and that these individuals may differ in clinically meaningful ways from those without childhood ADHD.

DSM-IV-TR mental disorders were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID) and included mood (major depressive episode), anxiety (generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia, specific phobia), and behaviour disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disorder).The MINI-KID was administered independently to the primary caregiver and youth aged 12 to 17 years in the family's home.\n## RESULTS\nPast 6-month prevalence of any mental disorder ranged from 18.2% to 21.8% depending on age and informant. Behaviour disorders were the most common among children, and anxiety disorders were the most common among youth. Among children and youth with a parent-identified mental disorder, 25.6% of children and 33.7% of youth had contact with a mental health provider.

These findings provide support for strengthening prevention and early intervention efforts and enhancing service capacity to meet the mental health needs of children and youth in Ontario.\n## OBJECTIFS :\nPrésenter la prévalence de six mois et les corrélats sociodémographiques des troubles mentaux et des contacts avec les services liés à la santé mentale dans un échantillon d’enfants (de 4 à 11 ans) et d’adolescents (de 12 à 17 ans) en Ontario.\n## MÉTHODES :\nL’Étude sur la santé des jeunes Ontariens 2014 est une étude représentative à l’échelle provinciale de 6 537 familles d’enfants de 4 à 17 ans de l’Ontario. Les troubles mentaux du DSM-IV-TR ont été évalués à l’aide de la Mini-entrevue neuropsychiatrique internationale pour enfants et adolescents (MINI KID) et comprenaient des troubles de l’humeur (épisode dépressif majeur), anxieux (anxiété généralisée, anxiété de séparation, phobie sociale, phobie spécifique) et des troubles du comportement (trouble de déficit de l’attention avec hyperactivité, trouble oppositionnel avec provocation, trouble des conduites). La MINI-KID a été administrée indépendamment au principal soignant et aux adolescents de 12 à 17 ans, au domicile familial.\n## RÉSULTATS :\nLa prévalence des 6 mois précédents pour tout trouble mental allait de 18,2% à 21,8%, en fonction de l’âge et du répondant. Les troubles du comportement étaient les plus répandus chez les enfants et les troubles anxieux étaient les plus communs chez les adolescents.

            "abstract": "Mental health disorders often develop during childhood and adolescence, causing long term and debilitating impacts at individual and societal levels. Local, early, and precise assessment and evidence-based treatment are key to achieve positive mental health outcomes and to avoid long-term care. Technological advancements, such as computerized Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs), can support practitioners in providing evidence-based care. While previous studies have found CDSS implementation helps to improve aspects of medical care, evidence is limited on its use for child and adolescent mental health care. This paper presents challenges and opportunities for adapting CDSS design and implementation to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). To highlight the complexity of incorporating CDSSs within local CAMHS, we have structured the paper around four components to consider before designing and implementing the CDSS: supporting collaboration among multiple stakeholders involved in care; optimally using health data; accounting for comorbidities; and addressing the temporality of patient care. The proposed perspective is presented within the context of the child and adolescent mental health services in Norway and an ongoing Norwegian innovative research project, the Individualized Digital DEcision Assist System (IDDEAS), for child and adolescent mental health disorders. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among children and adolescents serves as the case example. The integration of IDDEAS in Norway intends to yield significantly improved outcomes for children and adolescents with enduring mental health disorders, and ultimately serve as an educational opportunity for future international approaches to such CDSS design and implementation."

            "abstract": "Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed neurobehavioral disorder in children and adolescents, and in about half of these patients, significant symptomology continues into adulthood. Although impulsivity and hyperactivity are the most salient features of ADHD, cognitive deficits, particularly impairments in attention and executive function, are an important component, particularly in adolescents and adults, with over 90% of adults seeking treatment for ADHD manifesting cognitive dysfunction. Currently available medications treat the core ADHD symptoms but typically do not adequately address cognitive aspects of ADHD, underscoring the need for new therapeutics. Dopamine and norepinephrine are hypothesized to be particularly important in ADHD, but there is emerging evidence that cholinergic neurotransmission, particularly involving neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), may play a role in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Nicotine has demonstrated procognitive effects in both humans and experimental animals and has produced signals of efficacy in small proof-of-concept adult ADHD trials. Although adverse effects associated with nicotine preclude its development as a therapeutic, a number of novel nAChR agonists with improved safety/tolerability profiles have been discovered. Of these, ABT-418 and ABT-089 have both demonstrated signals of efficacy in adults with ADHD. Notably, tolerability issues that might be expected of a nAChR agonist, such as nausea and emesis, were not observed at efficacious doses of ABT-089. Further understanding of the effects of novel neuronal nAChR agonists on specific aspects of cognitive functioning in ADHD is required to assess the full potential of this approach."

Financial stressors, course workload, peer pressure, and other personal, family, and societal stressors contribute to the high incidence of mental disorders among college students. Despite the high prevalence of mental disorders in college students, barriers such as lack of mental health literacy, stigma of mental health, inadequate numbers of mental health counselors and clinical psychologists supporting students in colleges in both low- and high-income countries, and financial and geographical barriers often hinder college students from accessing the needed mental supports. There is increasing evidence on the effectiveness and feasibility of mobile technology in health promotion and closing psychological treatment gaps. College students are well adapted to the use of mobile technology, particularly text and email messaging daily, which presents a unique opportunity for an innovative way to offer support for their mental health. In this article, we provide a perspective on the ResilienceNHope program, an evidence-based text and email messaging innovation, to close the psychological treatment gap and improve the mental health literacy of college students."

We aimed to assess the acceptability, safety, and use of BlueIce and to explore the effects on the primary outcome of self-harm and the secondary outcomes of psychological functioning.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We undertook an open trial where we recruited young people aged 12 to 17 years attending specialist child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) who were currently self-harming or had a history of self-harm. Eligible participants were assessed at baseline and then given BlueIce. They were assessed 2 weeks later (post familiarization) and again at 12 weeks (post use). A behavior-screening questionnaire (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) was completed along with standardized measures of depression (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire or MFQ) and anxiety (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale or RCADS), taking into account self-reports of self-harm, app helpfulness, and safety.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All core CAMHS professional groups referred at least 1 young person. Out of 40 young people recruited, 37 (93%) elected to use BlueIce after familiarization, with 29 out of 33 (88%) wanting to keep it at the end of the study. No young person called the emergency numbers during the 12-week trial, and no one was withdrawn by his or her clinician due to increased risk of suicide. Almost three-quarters (73%) of those who had recently self-harmed reported reductions in self-harm after using BlueIce for 12 weeks. There was a statistically significant mean difference of 4.91 (t31=2.11; P=.04; 95% CI 0.17-9.64) on postuse symptoms of depression (MFQ) and 13.53 on symptoms of anxiety (RCADS) (t30=3.76; P=.001; 95% CI 6.17-20.90), which was evident across all anxiety subscales. Ratings of app acceptability and usefulness were high.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our study has a number of methodological limitations, particularly the absence of a comparison group and a prospective way of assessing self-harm.

Compared with subjects without a history of migraine, those with such a history had significantly more physical symptoms and were more likely to report job absenteeism, assess their general health as fair or poor, and use mental health services. Follow-up data, gathered 14 months after the baseline interview, revealed that subjects with a history of migraine at the baseline had significantly increased rates of first incidence major depression and panic disorder during the interval period (odds ratio (OR) for major depression = 4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-9.2; and OR for panic disorder = 12.8, 95% CI 4.1-39.8).

Yet, in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), where 90% of adolescents reside, mental health services are extremely limited, and the majority do not have access to treatment. Integration of mental health services within primary care of LMICs has been proposed as an efficient and sustainable way to close the adolescent mental health treatment gap. However, there is limited research on how to effectively implement integrated mental health care in LMIC. In the present study, we employed Implementation Mapping to develop a multilevel strategy for integrating adolescent depression services within primary care clinics of Maputo, Mozambique. Both in-person and virtual approaches for Implementation Mapping activities were used to support an international implementation planning partnership and promote the engagement of multilevel stakeholders. We identified determinants to implementation of mental health services for adolescents in LMIC across all levels of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, of which of 25% were unique to adolescent-specific services. Through a series of stakeholder workshops focused on implementation strategy selection, prioritization, and specification, we then developed an implementation plan comprising 33 unique strategies that target determinants at the intervention, patient, provider, policy, and community levels. The implementation plan developed in this study will be evaluated for delivering adolescent depression services in Mozambican primary care and may serve as a model for other low-resource settings."

            "abstract": "Research indicates that depression and anxiety are highly comorbid in youth. Little is known, however, about the clinical and family characteristics of youth with principal anxiety disorders and comorbid depressive diagnoses. The present study examined the demographic, clinical, and family characteristics of 200 anxiety-disordered children and adolescents (aged 7-17) with and without comorbid depressive disorders (major depressive disorder or dysthymic disorder), seeking treatment at a university-based anxiety clinic. All participants met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for a principal anxiety disorder (generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, or social phobia). Of these, twelve percent (n = 24) also met criteria for a comorbid depressive disorder. Results suggest that anxiety-disordered youth with comorbid depressive disorders (AD-DD) were older at intake, had more severe anxious and depressive symptomatology, and were more impaired than anxiety-disordered youth without comorbid depressive disorders (AD-NDD). AD-DD youth also reported significantly more family dysfunction than AD-NDD youth. Future research should examine how this diagnostic and family profile may impact treatment for AD-DD youth."

Methods: Data for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (N = 95,856) who participated in the annual, cross-sectional National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2011 to 2016 were pooled and analyzed. Time trends and predictors of adolescents' depression and treatment were examined using Pearson's χ² test and multivariable logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of adolescents' 12-month depression increased steadily from 8.3% to 12.9% over the years, but their use of mental health services remained largely stable. Higher rates of depression were observed in females, older adolescents, and those from single-mother households. Having less authoritative parents and negative school experiences significantly predicted adolescent depression. Lower rates of treatment and medication use were found among racial/ethnic minorities and adolescents without any insurance. Whereas having less authoritative parents decreased adolescents' likelihood of using healthcare services, negative school experiences significantly increased their chances of using treatments and medication. Conclusions: A growing number of adolescents with untreated depression were noted over time. Enhanced psychoeducation, continued policy efforts, and expanded service capacity are warranted."

            "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a frequently diagnosed disorder in child- and adulthood with a high impact affecting multiple facets of social life. Therefore, patients suffering from ADHD are at high risk to be confronted with stigma, prejudices, and discrimination. A review of the empirical research in the field of ADHD with regard to stigma was performed. The findings of investigations in this field were clustered in different categories, including stigma in children with ADHD, stigma in adults with ADHD, stigma in relatives or in people close to a patient with ADHD, and the influence of stigma on authorities' attitudes toward patients with ADHD. Variables identified to contribute to stigma in ADHD are public's uncertainty concerning the reliability/validity of an ADHD diagnosis and the related diagnostic assessment, public's perceived dangerousness of individuals with ADHD, socio-demographical factors as age, gender, and ethnicity of the respondent or the target individual with ADHD, stigmatization of ADHD treatment, for example public's skepticism toward ADHD medication and disclosure of diagnostic status as well as medication status of the individual with ADHD. The contribution of stigma associated with ADHD can be conceptualized as an underestimated risk factor, affecting treatment adherence, treatment efficacy, symptom aggravation, life satisfaction, and mentally well-being of individuals affected by ADHD. Public as well as health professionals' concepts about ADHD are highly diverse, setting individuals with an ADHD diagnosis at greater risk to get stigmatized."

This descriptive study examines the complexity of psychiatric comorbidity in treatment-seeking youth with ASD and anxiety symptoms. Forty-two parents of 8- to 14-year-old children with ASD and anxiety symptoms completed a structured psychiatric interview (K-SADS) and provided information about the child's past and current psychological functioning as part of a screening process to enter an anxiety intervention program. Overall, comorbidity was very complex, with children obtaining an average of 4 psychiatric diagnoses (including anxiety disorders) on a structured clinical interview (range = 0-9). Onset and course differed by psychiatric disorder. Complexity of comorbidity did not differ significantly by age, sex, or autism severity. Despite clinical significance of the symptoms reported, few children were currently (or ever) engaged in mental health treatment or group psychosocial intervention. Although the specificity of the current sample limits the generalizability of these results, findings suggest that treatment-seeking children with ASD and anxiety often present with additional psychiatric symptoms, which supports a transdiagnostic approach to research and intervention in this area. Accurate assessment of comorbidity may provide valuable information for families and clinicians regarding individualized treatment approaches."

We found that children with ADHD and psychiatric comorbidity were less likely to use psychostimulants (odds ratio [OR] = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.55-0.93, p = 0.01) but more likely to use antidepressants (OR = 2.74, 95% CI = 1.95-3.86, p < 0.01), alpha adrenergic agonists (OR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.93-3.57, p < 0.01), and other psychotropic medications (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.27-4.50, p < 0.01) than children with uncomplicated ADHD (who were more likely to use stimulants only). Additionally, children with psychiatric comorbidity were more likely to use multiple psychotropic drugs (p < 0.01).

The migration experience of these youth may be subjectively different depending on a wide range of factors. The complexities of migration are explored as a traumatic, tripartite process. These three salient components of migration may act as precursors, often resulting in psychological sequelae such as: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. Of all migrant groups, URM are more likely to develop psychiatric symptoms. Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS), and Mental Health for Immigrants Program (MHIP) are among the most effective interventions in the treatment of PTSD, anxiety, and depression in refugee minors. Social workers in schools are in unique positions to provide mental health services to URM. A case example illustrating a cultural adaptation of TF-CBT in an urban public high school is included. Clinical implications of culturally responsive and trauma-informed treatment of URM in schools will be discussed.

We present prevalence data for the child and adolescent population of Puerto Rico and examine the relation of DSM-IV diagnoses to global impairment, demographic correlates, and service use in an island-wide representative sample.\n## METHODS\nWe sampled 1886 child-caretaker dyads in Puerto Rico by using a multistage sampling design. Children were aged 4 to 17 years. Response rate was 90.1%. Face-to-face interviews of children and their primary caretakers were performed by trained laypersons who administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, version IV (DISC-IV) in Spanish. Global impairment was measured by using the Children's Global Assessment Scale scored by the interviewer of the parent. Reports of service use were obtained by using the Service Assessment for Children and Adolescents.\n## RESULTS\nAlthough 19.8% of the sample met DSM-IV criteria without considering impairment, 16.4% of the population had 1 or more of the DSM-IV disorders when a measure of impairment specific to each diagnosis was considered. The overall prevalence was further reduced to 6.9% when a measure of global impairment was added to that definition. The most prevalent disorders were attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (8.0%) and oppositional defiant disorder (5.5%). Children in urban settings had higher rates than those in rural regions. Older age was related to higher rates of major depression and social phobia, and younger age was related to higher rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Both overall rates and rates of specific DSM-IV/DISC-IV disorders were related to service use. Children with impairment without diagnosis were more likely to use school services, whereas children with impairment with diagnosis were more likely to use the specialty mental health sector. Of those with both a diagnosis and global impairment, only half received services from any source.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBecause we used the DISC-IV to apply DSM-IV criteria, the study yielded prevalence rates that are generally comparable with those found in previous surveys. The inclusion of diagnosis-specific impairment criteria reduced rates slightly. When global impairment criteria were imposed, the rates were reduced by approximately half.\n"

However, reliability and validity of brief screeners for anxiety and depression have not been assessed in college students. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess in a sample of college students the psychometric properties of PHQ-4, a brief screening tool for depression and anxiety. Undergraduate students were recruited from general education classes at a Midwestern university. Students were given a questionnaire that asked them whether they had been diagnosed by a doctor or health professional with anxiety or depression. Next, they were asked to respond to the items on the PHQ-4 scale. A total of 934 students responded to the survey (response rate=72%). Majority of the participants were females (63%) and Whites (80%). The internal reliability of PHQ-4 was found to be high (α=0.81). Those who were diagnosed with depression or anxiety had statistically significantly higher scores on PHQ-4 (p<0.01). Corrected item total correlations for PHQ-4 were between r=0.66 and r=0.80. PHQ-4 operating characteristics were estimated and area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.835 and 0.787, respectively for anxiety and depression. The PHQ-4 is a reliable and valid tool that can serve as a mass screener for depression and anxiety in young adults.

Having a sibling currently in the military increases the likelihood of having a lifetime and a past-year major depressive episode (MDE), but not a past-year MDE with severe role impairment or use of mental health services. Having a parent in the military is not associated with any measure of MDE, but increases use of specialty outpatient, specialty inpatient/residential, and non-specialty mental health services net of MDE and sociodemographic controls.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Considerable attention has focused on risk and resilience among the dependent children of current service members. A better understanding of how the current military service experiences of siblings, as well as parents, influences related adolescents' mental health, mental health care service use, substance use, and health behaviors has the potential to contribute to programs and interventions that can enhance the well-being of youth with intra-generational, as well as inter-generational, connections to the military. Adolescents who have a sibling currently serving in the military are an at-risk population for MDE and potentially other mental and behavioral health problems."

High quantitative and categorical stability was found for cross-informant syndromes within samples of younger and older subjects. Throughout childhood and into young adulthood, parent ratings of most syndromes at the time of referral predicted the counterpart cross-informant syndrome construct at follow-up, controlling for other types of problems at referral. There were multiple additional independent predictors of many syndromes, including Delinquent Behavior, Aggressive Behavior, and Shows Off for young adult males. Time 1 Social Problems and Attention Problems independently predicted diverse problems at Time 2 for younger males. A wide variety of problems also predicted younger males' self-ratings of withdrawal, anxiety, and depression. The stability of problems for the referred sample was similar to that found for demographically matched nonreferred subjects drawn from a national sample."

We identified 31 articles that met all inclusion and exclusion criteria. The findings from this review indicate that persistence and adherence to atomoxetine treatment were generally high. Factors found to influence adherence and nonadherence to atomoxetine treatment in ADHD in this review include age, sex, the definition of response used, length of treatment, initial dose of treatment, comorbid conditions, and reimbursement. Tolerability was cited as an important reason for treatment discontinuation. More research is needed to understand those factors that can help to identify patients at risk for poor adherence and interventions that could improve treatment adherence early in the stage of this illness to secure a better long-term prognosis."

Initial positive results have also been found in relation to parental knowledge, children's emotional, social and academic functioning - although most studies have not used blinded outcomes. Generic and specialised ADHD parent training approaches - delivered either individually or in groups - have reported beneficial effects. High-quality training, supervision of therapists and practice with the child, may improve outcomes but further evidence is required. Evidence for who benefits the most from behavioural interventions is scant. There is no evidence to limit behavioural treatments to parents with parenting difficulties or children with conduct problems.

Despite high rates of medication use and co-morbid mental health difficulties, there appears to be a complete absence of referral to publicly available AMHS for ADHD youth transitioning from CAMHS in Ireland. More understanding of obstacles and optimum service configuration is essential to ensure that care is both available and accessible to young people with ADHD."

Yet, little is known about outpatient CPCMs. This pilot study describes an outpatient CPCM for 22 PCPs in a large Northeast Florida county. PCPs referred 81 patients, of which 60 were appropriate for collaborative management and 49 were subsequently seen for outpatient psychiatric consultation. The most common psychiatric diagnoses following consultation were anxiety (57%), ADHD (53%), and depression (39%). Over half (57%) of the patients seen for consultation were discharged to their PCP with appropriate treatment recommendations, and only a small minority (10%) of patients required long-term care by a psychiatrist. This CPCM helped child psychiatrists collaborate with PCPs to deliver mental health services for youth. The CPCM should be considered for adaptation and dissemination."

            "abstract": "Major depressive disorders (MDD) and anxiety disorders fall within a spectrum of psychiatric disorders that are characterized by severe and/or persistent symptoms of sadness and irritability that can cause considerable distress and interfere with daily activities. Untreated, they may lead to serious developmental, personal and societal difficulties that may prejudice school success, work productivity, adult development and the forming of relationships. In Canada, it is estimated that approximately 5% of male youth and 12% of female youth have experienced a major depressive episode during their childhood or adolescent years.\n    \n\n      \n      Patients suffering from such conditions may require psychological (i.e. cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)) and/or pharmacological treatment such as second generation antidepressants (i.e., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRI] and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRI]). Early studies on second generation antidepressants suggest that they are well tolerated in young people, although it remains a controversial issue as some studies have suggested an unfavorable risk-benefit profile due to higher risks of suicidality (i.e., worsening suicidal thoughts and self-harm behavior). In 2003, Health Canada issued warnings and placed ‘black box’ labels on the monographs of antidepressants given these concerns. Despite marked reductions in the volume of antidepressant prescriptions by Canadian youths since these warnings, subsequent studies have noted lowered utilization of psychotherapy and mental health services in addition to an increased suicide rate among youths. Both the 2008 revised Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guideline (co-sponsored by CANMAT and the Canadian Psychiatric Association) and a 2008 position paper on SSRI use (endorsed by the Canadian Psychiatric Association and the College of Family Physicians of Canada) have since suggested that there is evidence supporting a modest efficacy for SSRI and SNRI for the treatment of depression and anxiety in pediatric patients. If applied properly and monitored closely, patients may stand to benefit substantially with a small risk of increased suicidality. It is uncertain the extent to which new evidence reporting the clinical effectiveness and safety of second generation antidepressants has become available in the time since these guidelines were published.\n    \n\n      \n      The purpose of this Rapid Response report is therefore to assess the available evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness of second generation antidepressants in a pediatric population. This summary and review of recent clinical evidence may be useful towards supporting the development of evidence-based recommendations on the role and optimal prescribing of these second-generation antidepressants for pediatrics."

The response of Latinx youth to treatment for depression and anxiety in Brent and colleagues' studies is promising and can help explain why previous studies of Hispanic youth found lower rates of receiving depression care. Brent and colleagues' results of brief behavioral therapy (BBT) at 32 weeks are mostly in line with results of their original study2: BBT was superior to assisted referral to care (ARC) regarding treatment response and functioning. Like the original study, at week 32, ethnicity continued to moderate the effect of BBT on anxiety (but not depression), due to a lower response rate of Hispanics to assisted referrals to care than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Findings demonstrated that Hispanics had a stronger response to BBT than assisted referral to outpatient care in comparison to non-Hispanic whites; however, at 32 weeks, ethnicity did not moderate BBT impact on functioning, suggesting that the treatment worked the same for non-Hispanic whites as for Hispanics. Such findings suggest that availability of services, identification of need, and easy navigation to mental health services might be some of the reasons for the persistent mental health access disparities among youth of color."

These two disorders are linked to one another in a variety of ways.

Individuals with ADHD may demonstrate earlier onset of the substance abuse and a pattern of more frequent or intense use. ADHD symptoms were explored as possible antecedents of opioid dependence. A total of 109 adult opioid-dependent, treatment-seeking male and female outpatients were investigated with an extended clinical semistructured interview to collect sociodemographic, drug-related, and clinical data. The results indicate that ADHD alone does not predispose the development of opioid dependence in our sample. Childhood ADHD symptoms may nevertheless be found more frequently related to school performance problems and difficulties in social adaptation, which was identified in more than half of our population. Patients with ADHD history seemed to experience a drug abuse career with more complications which need to be recognized with focused attention in order to start earlier treatment strategies."

Research suggests that single-session \"growth mind-set\" interventions (GM-SSIs)-which teach the belief that personal traits are malleable through effort-may reduce internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescents. However, GM-SSIs have not been evaluated among rural youth, and their effects on internalizing and externalizing problems have not been assessed within a single trial, rendering their relative benefits for different problem types unclear. We examined whether a computerized GM-SSI could reduce depressive symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, and conduct problems in female adolescents from rural areas of the United States. Tenth-grade female adolescents (N = 222, M age = 15.2, 38% White, 25% Black, 29% Hispanic) from 4 rural, low-income high schools in the southeastern United States were randomized to receive a 45-min GM-SSI or a computer-based active control program, teaching healthy sexual behaviors. Young women self-reported depression symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, and conduct problem behaviors at baseline and 4-month follow-up. Relative to the female students in the control group, the students receiving the GM-SSI reported modest but significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms (d= .23) and likelihood of reporting elevated depressive symptoms (d= .29) from baseline to follow-up. GM-SSI effects were nonsignificant for social anxiety symptoms, although a small effect size emerged in the hypothesized direction (d= .21), and nonsignificant for change in conduct problems (d= .01). A free-of-charge 45-min GM-SSI may help reduce internalizing distress, especially depression-but not conduct problems-in rural female adolescents."

This is especially true for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is one of the most common chronic pediatric conditions and often involves children with a variety of overlapping physical, psychological, or neurodevelopmental disorders. A special challenge for developing alternative dosage forms for ADHD treatment is the incorporation of a once-daily long-acting formulation. Traditional ADHD medication formulations have been limited, and issues surrounding prescribed dosing regimens-including poor medication adherence, difficulty swallowing, and the lack of dosing titration options-persist in ADHD treatment. In other disease areas, the development of alternative formulations has provided options for patients who have issues with consuming solid dosage forms, particularly children and individuals with developmental disorders. In the light of these new developments, several alternative formulations for ADHD medications are under development or have recently become available. This article reviews the various strategies for developing alternative dosage forms in other disease areas and discusses the application of these strategies in ADHD treatment.

However, anxiety disorders often remain undetected and untreated in older adults. This discrepancy may be accounted for by a combination of patient variables (eg, a lack of help-seeking behavior and long duration of illness) and variables related to current clinical practice (eg, a lack of knowledge regarding late-life anxiety and ageism). Because anxiety disorders usually have an age at onset earlier in life, patients and mental health professionals may be inclined to attribute the anxiety and avoidance symptoms to personality factors instead of a treatable syndrome. Comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, such as depressive disorder, may complicate the appropriate diagnosis. Identification may be further obscured because the phenomenology of anxiety disorders in older adults tends to differ from the phenomenology in younger adults. Randomized controlled trials have yielded support for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy and serotonergic antidepressants. However, both treatments seem hampered by relatively high dropout rates, and the available data are based primarily on a relatively healthy, well-educated, and \"young\" older population.

            "abstract": "One of the challenges facing modern psychiatry is to determine to what extent the diagnostic categories clinicians have represent valid constructs. Epidemiologic studies are helpful in this regard when their findings are consistent across various cultural or geographic settings or with those of clinical studies. The cross-national epidemiologic data on OCD reviewed in this article are remarkable for their consistency in rates, age at onset, and comorbidity across diverse countries, a fact which lends additional support to the validity of the diagnosis of OCD. The variability in symptom presentation across national sites suggests that cultural factors may affect the symptom expression; however, why the rates of OCD and other psychiatric disorders are so much lower in Taiwan than in other sites, including another Asian site, is unclear. Epidemiologic studies of adolescents and of adults have shown similar prevalence of OCD and substantial comorbidity with major depression and other anxiety disorders. Studies of adolescent populations indicate that OCD symptoms are fairly common among adolescents but not necessarily predictive of developing the full disorder within 1 year of follow-up. Family studies have suggested an association between OCD and TS and other CMT disorders. Clinical studies have suggested an association between Sydenham's chorea and OCD. These various studies provide a growing body of knowledge regarding the nature of OCD. Together with evidence of the substantial demand on mental health services by those afflicted with OCD, the epidemiologic data make a compelling case for additional efforts to improve the understanding and treatment of this troubling disorder."

Semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted to explore in depth perceptions of facilitators of and barriers to the help-seeking behavior and academic achievement of student pharmacists who had received a D or F grade in any year. A 4-part survey instrument was developed and administered to all student pharmacists and included sections for (1) attitudes and academic help-seeking behavior, (2) health status, (3) demographics, and (4) open comments. A structural equation modeling approach was used to assess relationships among domains of interest.Results. Three student focus groups noted that helpfulness of faculty members and school administrators were 2 prominent facilitators of help-seeking behavior and academic achievement. Diminished quality of life caused by stress and depression was the primary barrier to help-seeking and achievement. Three hundred four (68.6%) student pharmacists completed the survey instrument. Academic help-seeking behavior was influenced mostly by perceived academic competence and perceived faculty helpfulness. In contrast, ambivalence and perception of help-seeking as threatening were 2 factors that were negatively associated with academic help-seeking behavior.Conclusions. Academic help-seeking behavior was positively related to greater perceived academic competence and positive relationships among student pharmacists and faculty members."

Discriminant function analysis was used to identify the items in the standardized assessment package that best discriminated between children with ADHD and children with RAD. Clinicians' ratings of RAD symptoms were reliable, particularly when focusing on eight core DSM-IV symptoms of RAD. Certain parent-report symptoms were highly discriminatory between children with ADHD and children with RAD. These symptoms included \"cuddliness with strangers\" and \"comfort-seeking with strangers\". A semi-structured interview with parents, observation of the child in the waiting room and teacher report of RAD symptoms aided diagnostic discrimination between the groups.

The average rates of non-adherence in children and adults ranged between 15 and 87%. Factors predicting increased adherence/persistence included the use of long-acting formulations, younger age, Caucasian background, family structure and the presence and treatment of comorbidities. Decreased adherence/persistence were predicted by multiple daily dosing, family history of ADHD, experiences of adverse effects, stigma and treatment inefficacy.

We further tested whether parental anxiety and rearing approaches (as perceived by parents and children) predicted children's longitudinal outcomes of internalizing problems and severity of the SP over time, above and beyond the effects of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) for the treatment of the SP.

We conducted eight separate focus groups involving patients, their families and their therapists from three CMHCs. A total of 52 persons were involved. The groups explored patients' and family's explanatory model of depression, perceptions about the course of the disease, the role of medication and other treatments, the main causes of non-adherence, and interventions which would help increase it. Patients and families had a complex cognitive model of depression, which combined intrinsic vulnerability, psychological suffering during childhood and adolescence, and adverse life events. Drugs as well as other treatments were considered helpful, more so by patients than by family members. Denial of the disease and need to test its continuing presence were the main causes of non-adherence for patients, while adverse reactions did not play a relevant role. Mental health professionals tended to underestimate non-adherence in depressed patients, and did not question their patients about medication adherence. Family members needed more information on depression, on how to manage their relatives, as well as psychological and social support for themselves. The study allowed for the identification of a number of specific interventions aimed at facilitating treatment adherence, such as providing more information to patients and families, and training doctors and nurses in effective prevention and management of non-adherence."

            "abstract": "Youth with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) frequently experience academic impairment, including lower grades than their peers and elevated risk for grade retention and school dropout. Medication is the most commonly used treatment for youth with ADHD, and it is therefore essential to understand the extent to which medication use improves long-term academic functioning. This paper reviews the literature on the relation between long-term medication use and the academic outcomes of youth with ADHD. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify pertinent studies published since 2000 that followed youth with ADHD for 3 or more years. Academic outcomes of interest included school grades, achievement test scores, and grade retention. Nine studies were identified reporting on eight distinct longitudinal samples (N across studies = 8,721). These studies demonstrate that long-term medication use is associated with improvements in standardized achievement scores. However, the magnitude of these improvements is small and the clinical or educational significance is questionable. Evidence for long-term improvements in school grades and grade retention is less compelling. This review highlights methodological considerations in providing directions for future research. The importance of using multiple sources to gather information about medication adherence is discussed, including use of methodologies such as electronic monitors, rather than relying solely on parent report or chart review. Future research should also examine a range of medication adherence definitions in order to determine whether age of onset, duration of use, dose, and/or consistency of use moderates the relation between long-term medication use and academic outcomes."

However, most children do not adhere to their pharmacotherapy regimen, and have no contact with their physician during the first month of pharmacotherapy. A mobile health (mHealth) approach may bridge the gap between physicians and patients, allowing for more frequent communications as well as better monitoring of adherence to the prescribed treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      The study sample included 39 children with ADHD (27 boys), aged 9.56±2.41 years.

            "abstract": "There is limited availability of mental health services in Nigeria, and indeed most of Africa. Available services are also often under-utilized because of widespread ignorance and supernatural beliefs about the etiology of mental illnesses. The consequence, therefore, is a long and tedious pathway to care for the mentally ill, especially children and adolescents. This was a study of all new patients, aged 18 years and below, presenting over a 6 month period in 2009 (January - June) at the outpatient clinic of a tertiary psychiatric facility in northern Nigeria. A socio-demographic questionnaire was utilized, along with a record of the clinician's assessment of diagnosis for 242 patients. Subjects who had been withdrawn from school, or any previously engaged-in activity for longer than 4 weeks on account of the illness, were recorded as having disability from the illness. The children were aged 1-18 years (mean=12.3; SD=5.2) with males accounting for 51.7% (125) while 14.5% of the females (n=117) were married. Two thirds (64.5%) of the patients had been ill for longer than 6 months prior to presentation. One hundred and forty four subjects (59.5%) had received no care at all, while 36.4% had received treatment from traditional/religious healers prior to presentation. The most disabling conditions were ADHD (80%), mental retardation (77.8%), epilepsy (64.1%) and psychotic disorders (50%). There is urgent need for extending mental health services into the community in order to improve access to care and increase awareness about effective and affordable treatments."

            "abstract": "Anxiety and depressive disorders are the most common mental health disorders in adolescents, yet only a minority of young people with these disorders access professional help. This study aims to address this treatment gap by improving our understanding of barriers and facilitators to seeking/accessing professional help as perceived by adolescents with anxiety/depressive disorders identified in the community. Twenty-two adolescents, aged 11-17 years, who met diagnostic criteria for a current anxiety and/or depressive disorder were identified through school-based screening. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted one-to-one with each adolescent and adolescents' parents were interviewed separately for the purpose of data triangulation. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. We identified four themes capturing adolescent perceived barriers and facilitators to seeking/accessing professional help for anxiety and depressive disorders: (1) making sense of difficulties, (2) problem disclosure, (3) ambivalence to seeking help, and (4) the instrumental role of others. Barriers/facilitators identified within each theme reflect important developmental characteristics of adolescence, such as a growing need for autonomy and concerns around negative social evaluation. At the same time, the results highlight adolescents' dependency on other people, mainly their parents and school staff, when it comes to successfully accessing professional help for their mental health difficulties. This study identifies a number of barriers/facilitators that influence help-seeking behaviour of adolescents with anxiety and/or depressive disorders. These factors need to be addressed when targeting treatment utilisation rates in this particular group of young people."

For the two groups of cases involving a child older than one year, filicidal mothers were more affected by circumstantial factors such as health problems of the child or severe marital discord. These problems may then have caused a reactive mental disorder among these mothers. The risk of fatal abuse or neglect was higher for handicapped preschool children.

The diagnostic classes examined were ADHD (39%), depression (31%) and anxiety (13%). This prospective cohort design study collected medical records of 329 children referred to TCPS by 139 PCPs. To detect the likelihood of return to referring pediatricians for follow-up care at discharge from TCPS, we employed logistic regression models. Mean age was 12.3 (SD = 4.0); 43% were female. Ninety-three percent of parents complied with pediatricians' recommendations to have their child assessed by a child psychiatrist. A total of 28.0% of referrals returned to PCPs for follow-up care; the remainder were followed in mental health. Regression findings indicated that children with major depression (OR = 7.5) or anxiety disorders (OR = 5.1) were less likely to return to PCPs compared to ADHD even though severity of psychiatric illness and functional levels did not differ across diagnostic groups. Families widely accepted pediatricians' recommendations for referral to child psychiatrists. Depression and anxiety were strong correlates of retention in mental health settings at discharge from TCPS though children with these disorders appeared to be no more severely ill or functionally limited than peers with ADHD. These children possibly could be managed in a less intensive and expensive primary care treatment setting that could access mental health specialty services as needed in a collaborative model of care. TCPS is contrasted with the well-known collaborative model for adult depression in primary care. TCPS could serve as a feasible model of care that addresses the daunting barriers in accessing pediatric mental health services."

Although South Africa's paediatric population that is infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the largest worldwide, little research has been conducted on their mental health challenges. However, attributing high levels of mental health problems solely to their HIV status can be problematic as there may be other contributory factors. This research explored the mental health problems of HIV-infected children and compared these to the mental health problems of their HIV-unaffected peers from similar backgrounds. Data was gathered from two samples of child and caregiver pairs. HIV-infected children (aged 6-12 years) and their caregivers/mothers (n = 54) were recruited from the Kalafong paediatric clinic where they received medical treatment and routine ART. A comparison group of 113 HIV-uninfected children and their uninfected mothers were recruited from primary care clinics in the same community. Caregivers completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) to assess children's mental health. Children completed the Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ-I) and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). The scores of the psychometric sub-scales of the two groups were compared using parametric and non-parametric statistics. HIV-infected children experienced more somatic and affective problems, physiological anxiety, less ADHD and lower self-esteem than HIV-uninfected children in the comparison group, while controlling for age differences. The high levels of mental health problems of both groups of children may be attributed to similar difficult socio-economic circumstances. The fact that most infected children were not aware of their HIV-status could have influenced the results. Mental health services should not be limited to HIV-infected children but should form part of all health care services."

            "abstract": "A group of 3,287 French school pupils between the age of 12 to 20 years, of whom 14.4% had sought consultation for depression, were investigated in order to analyse the factors related to the type of medical help obtained. Multivariate analyses showed that severe emotional distress alone did not explain the help-seeking behavior. Thus, among those adolescents with the same anxio-depressive level, girls, older adolescents, adolescents with parents living apart, with health worries, and adolescents often absent from school more often sought help for depression. Socio economic status, however, did not correlate with a higher level of consultation for depression. Adolescents attending medical services for depression had a higher consultation rate, for any reason, with general practitioners and with school nurses, in whom they confided more often than their counterparts. Nonmedical professionals also seemed to contribute to accessing to medical help for depression. Overall, those who consulted for depression, in very limited numbers turned to mental health services (8.4%)."

            "abstract": "Researchers believe that almost 20% of children and adolescents struggle with chronic and persistent mental health concerns. Mental health is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Youth can struggle with several impairing mental health disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mood disorders, psychotic disorders, and autism spectrum disorder. Inadequately treated chronic mental illnesses can adversely affect the growing brain profoundly, including academic decline, early school dropout, cognitive deficits, interpersonal relationship concerns, aggression, suicide attempts or completion, substance use disorders, frequent hospital admissions, and inability to maintain employment. Even if diagnosed early in their course of illness, many of these individuals struggle to continue medications as prescribed. The factors predicting adherence to medications are underresearched in children and adolescents. Psychotropic medication compliance is a complicated issue that is tied to various aspects of caring for a minor individual. Hence, it is relevant to discuss factors that are predicted to contribute to noncompliance in this age group. The purpose of this review is to carefully consider the gaps in knowledge, suggesting interventions by using established instruments and clinical strategies to resolve the identified barriers for improving medication adherence. Compliance should be targeted at various levels, including the entire family tree and the treatment team."

We report the findings of the first systematic survey of leaders of psychiatry in nearly 60 countries on the strategies for reducing the treatment gap. We sought to elicit the views of these representatives on the roles of different human resources and health care settings in delivering care and on the importance of a range of strategies to increase the coverage of evidence-based treatments for priority mental disorders for each demographic stage (childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age). Our findings clearly indicate three strategies for reducing the treatment gap: increasing the numbers of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals; increasing the involvement of a range of appropriately trained non-specialist providers; and the active involvement of people affected by mental disorders. This is true for both high income and low/middle income countries, though relatively of more importance in the latter. We view this survey as a critically important first step in ascertaining the position of psychiatrists, one of the most influential stakeholder communities in global mental health, in addressing the global challenge of scaling up mental health services to reduce the treatment gap."

We conducted the first meta-analysis to estimate the rate of ADHD pharmacological treatment in both diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals. Based on a pre-registered protocol (CRD42018085233), we searched a broad set of electronic databases and grey literature. After screening 25,676 abstracts, we retained 36 studies including 104,305 subjects, from which 18 studies met our main analysis criteria. The pooled pharmacological treatment rates were 19.1 % and 0.9 % in school-age children/adolescents with and without ADHD, respectively. We estimated that for each individual using medication without a formal ADHD diagnosis, there are three patients with a formal diagnosis who might benefit from medication but do not receive it in the US. Our results indicate both overtreatment/misuse of medication in individuals without ADHD and pharmacological undertreatment in youths with the disorder. Our findings reinforce the need for public health policies improving education on ADHD and discussions on the benefits and limitations of ADHD medications."

In Indonesia, treatment rates are low among university students because of the high cost of treatment, stigma and the limited availability of mental care services. Internet-based interventions have been found to be effective in treating anxiety and depression in Western countries. However, little is known about the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as Indonesia.

This study sought to audit the value of two self-report measures within the inpatient adolescent setting. An admission sample of 67 young people completed the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) and Young Person's Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (YP CORE), with clinicians completing the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) and Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA). A follow-up dataset consisted of 20 young people who completed the measures on two occasions, with clinician ratings completed on admission and discharge. The RCADS and YP CORE measures showed discriminant and convergent reliability and appeared to index change in the current inpatient sample of adolescents. Self-report of symptoms and general functioning were closely related. There was little relationship between self-report and clinician ratings, emphasising the importance of collating self-report in addition to clinician ratings."

Three focus groups were conducted with parents (n = 23) of children with ADHD, and 2 with adolescents diagnosed with ADHD (n = 11). Parents and adolescents independently discussed the complexities surrounding their decisions to adhere to ADHD medication. Parents' negative beliefs about medication (fear of side effects) discouraged them from initiating therapy. Once initiated, parents struggled in balancing the need to medicate (improvements in learning and behavior) and concerns (weight loss, perceived delayed development) about the medication. Parents who had more concerns about the medication were more in favor of discontinuation. For adolescents, the desire for self-expression without being medicated was the primary factor determining nonadherence and/or discontinuation of the medication. Adolescents' medication-related concerns were relatively different from the parents. Phase- and group-specific interventions are required to improve medication adherence in people with ADHD."

Children had a physical examination, oral glucose tolerance tests with insulins, fasting lipid profiles and liver function tests.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Data from 283 children are presented (6.1-13.4 years, mean 9.8 years). There were no differences in birth data, family composition, parental age or socio-economic status between groups. Overweight and obese children were more likely to complain of musculoskeletal pain, depression, anxiety and bullying, and had more adverse examination findings than control children. They also had more abnormal investigations: overweight children: impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) 1.3%, hyperinsulinism 19.5%, dyslipidaemia 63.8%, raised alanine transaminase (ALT) 9.0%; obese children: IGT 5.3%, hyperinsulinism 38.9%, dyslipidaemia 73.7%, raised ALT 31.6%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Overweight and obese primary school-aged children have significant medical complications of their weight status. Overweight children, in addition to obese children, should be screened for complications. A secondary finding is a high proportion of normal weight children with lipid levels outside desirable healthy ranges."

Perceptions of pediatricians and mental health specialists regarding the role that pediatricians should have in diagnosing and managing children's mental health problems have not been studied.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To examine whether primary care pediatricians (PCPs) and child and adolescent psychiatrists (CAPs) agree about: (1) the pediatrician's role in identification, referral, and treatment of childhood mental health (MH) disorders; and (2) barriers to the identification, referral, and treatment of childhood MH disorders.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Surveys were mailed in 2005 to 338 PCPs and 75 CAPs in 7 counties surrounding Cleveland, Ohio. Each group was asked whether they agreed that PCPs should be responsible for identifying, treating, or referring 7 prevalent childhood MH problems. Barriers that PCPs face in identification, referral, and treatment of MH problems were also assessed. Analyses were weighted for nonresponse; group differences were assessed via Rao-Scott chi test and weighted regression analyses.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Approximately half of PCPs and CAPs returned the survey. With the exception of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the majority of PCPs and CAPs agreed that pediatricians should be responsible for identifying and referring, but not treating child MH conditions. For ADHD, PCPs were more likely than CAPs to agree that pediatricians should identify and treat affected children. PCPs were more likely than CAPs to agree that pediatricians should be responsible for identifying child/adolescent depression and anxiety disorders; the majority of both groups agree that PCPs should be responsible for referring, but not treating these conditions. Both groups agree that lack of MH services is a barrier to identification, treatment, and referral of child MH problems for PCPs. CAPs were more likely to agree that pediatrician's lack of training in identifying child mental health problems was a barrier, whereas PCPs were more likely to endorse lack of confidence in their ability to treat child MH problems with counseling, long waiting periods to see MH providers, family failure to follow through on referrals, and billing/reimbursement issues as barriers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Most PCPs and CAPs believe it is pediatricians' responsibility to identify and refer, but not treat, the majority of children's mental health problems. Both groups agree that mental health services are not readily available. Future efforts are needed to support PCPs and CAPs in their combined effort to address the mental health needs of children."

Fifty consecutive consenting children aged 5-15 years were screened and diagnosed for ADHD using Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition text revision criteria, and Kiddie Schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to study the pathway of care, using the WHO template.

            "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of mental health disorders and psychosocial distress among young people exceeds the capacity of mental health services. Social and systemic factors determine mental health as much as individual factors. To determine how best to address multi-level risk factors, we must first understand the distribution of risk. Previously, we have used psychometric methods applied to two epidemiologically-principled samples of people aged 14-24 to establish a robust, latent common mental distress (CMD) factor of depression and anxiety normally distributed across the population. This was linearly associated with suicidal thoughts and non-suicidal self-harm such that effective interventions to reduce CMD across the whole population could have a greater total benefit than those that focus on the minority with the most severe scores. In a randomised trial of mindfulness interventions in university students (the Mindful Student Study), we demonstrated a population-shift effect whereby the intervention group appeared resilient to a universal stressor. Given these findings, and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we argue that population-based interventions to reduce CMD are urgently required. To target all types of mental health determinants, these interventions must be multi-level. Careful design and evaluation, interdisciplinary work, and extensive local stakeholder involvement are crucial for these interventions to be effective."

Traumatized individuals are typically resistant to seeking treatment, so treatment must be taken to the survivors, at locations within their communities. Most helpful is to train and support mental health workers from the affected communities.

COMPLY was a prospective 12-month, observational, open-label study that included children and adolescents, aged 6-17 years, with ADHD. Medication adherence (i.e. compliance) was measured using the Pediatric Compliance Self-Rating (PCSR) instrument and using items 1-4 of the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS).

To do so, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Childhood Diagnoses were used to obtain DSM-IV diagnoses, while a modified Timeline Followback interview and self-reports were used to measure cannabis use, cannabis-related problems, and impairment. Most individuals had at least two Axis I disorders in addition to cannabis dependence. Anxiety disorders were common, with posttraumatic stress disorder, social phobia, and generalised anxiety disorder accounting for the majority of these diagnoses. On average, young people reported a moderate degree of dependence and functional impairment, and a substantial number of cannabis-related problems. Although both males and females reported using similar quantities of cannabis per month, females reported using cannabis more frequently than males. The current data suggest that young people who present for cannabis use treatment in the context of a mental health issue may have a variety of psychiatric problems that need addressed and that males and females may have slightly different profiles. If cannabis use treatments are to advance for this population, more attention needs to be paid to the complex issues that young people present to treatment with."

Parent interviews included assessments of psychiatric disorders with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-R), parental depression/anxiety, possible child abuse, stress, support, and the use of mental health services.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of any DISC disorder was 16.8%. Parental depression/anxiety and possible child abuse were associated independently with 2- to 3-times higher rates of disorder. Many parents (55%) who reported any disorder did not report discussing behavioral/emotional concerns with their pediatrician. Factors associated with discussing behavioral/emotional issues were the presence of any disorder and financial stress. Factors related to seeing a mental health professional were discussing behavioral/emotional issues with the pediatrician, single parenthood, and stressful life events.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence rates of disorders in this setting suggest that pediatricians are well-placed to identify and refer children with psychiatric disorders.

However, no prior study has investigated how much within-country geographic variation in ADHD diagnoses is explained by variation in ADHD symptom levels. We examine whether ADHD symptom levels explain variation in ADHD diagnoses among children and adolescents using nationwide survey and register data in Norway. Geographical variation in incidence of ADHD diagnosis was measured using Norwegian registry data from the child and adolescent mental health services for 2011-2016. Geographical variation in ADHD symptom levels in clinics' catchment areas was measured using data from the Norwegian mother, father and child cohort study for 2011-2016 (n = 39,850). Cross-sectional associations between ADHD symptom levels and the incidence of ADHD diagnoses were assessed with fractional response models. Geographical variation in ADHD diagnosis rates is much larger than what can be explained by geographical variation in ADHD symptoms levels. Treatment in the Norwegian child and adolescent mental health services is free, universally available upon referral, and practically without competition from the private sector. Factors beyond health care access and unequal symptom levels seem responsible for the geographical variation in ADHD diagnosis."

            "abstract": "Social recovery has become a prominent aspect of mental health service design and delivery in the past decade. Much of the literature on social recovery is derived from first-person accounts or primary research with adult service users experiencing severe mental illness. There is a lack of both theoretical and empirical work that could inform consideration of how the concept of social recovery might apply to adolescents experiencing common (non-psychotic) mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. The current study was conducted to understand the process of experiencing anxiety and depression in young people. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine adolescents with anxiety and depression (seven girls and two boys aged 14-16 years) and 12 mothers who were recruited from a specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service in the South of England. Thematic analysis indicated that young people do experience a process of 'recovery'; the processes participants described have some congruence with the earlier stages of adult recovery models involving biographical disruption and the development of new meanings, in this case of anxiety or depression, and changes in sense of identity. The accounts diverge with regard to later stages of adult models involving the development of hope and responsibility. The findings suggest that services should attend to social isolation and emphasise support for positive aspirations for future selves whilst also attending to young people's and parents' expectations about change. Methodological challenges face enquiry about 'recovery' given its connotations with cure in everyday language.\n    \n\n\n          Key practitioner message:\n        \n      \n      Theoretical and empirical work on social recovery in young people and families is lacking. Using interviews, this study sought to understand the relevance of social recovery for adolescents with anxiety and depression and their mothers. Findings suggest some congruence with the earlier stages of adult recovery models involving meaning and identity. Findings diverge with regard to later stages of adult recovery models involving hope and responsibility. Social recovery in mental health services for young people needs significant empirical attention and critical debate."

Little information is available, however, about services and interventions being received by children whose mental health benefits are carved out. Using claims data, this study explores the treatment of children with a common child psychiatric disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Children being treated for ADHD see a variety of provider combinations. Children diagnosed with comorbid mood or anxiety disorders are more likely to see a psychiatrist than a primary care physician or therapist, and they are more likely to be in treatment with both a psychiatrist and a therapist than with just one mental health professional. After controlling for severity indicators, costs were significantly lower for patients being treated by just a psychiatrist than for patients seeing both a psychiatrist and therapist. This finding raises the possibility that attempts to save money by \"splitting treatment\" may not be cost-effective."

Moreover, in this study, among the five provinces, Tehran and Mashhad allocated the highest rates of ODD; Isfahan and Shiraz had the highest rates of ADHD; and Tabriz had the highest rates of social phobia. Therefore, these percentage of psychiatric disorders in Iran lead us toward a greater use of consultation and mental health services."

Although some adults with ADHD were diagnosed as children, many are first diagnosed as adults. This poses particular challenges given the limited familiarity with ADHD of many adult mental health services. As a result, several organizations, including the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the National Institutes of Health, and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, have developed practice guidelines for the assessment and treatment of adults with ADHD. This article reviews those guidelines in order to examine current best practices in adult ADHD. There is considerable agreement among these guidelines, which should be a critical part of moving from emerging knowledge to patient care, although both empirical evaluation and ongoing updates as new knowledge emerges will be important for their future development."

Latent class models were fit to summary measures of psychotherapy and antidepressant use in the 12 months following the index diagnosis. We examined variation in baseline health, health care utilization, and health outcomes across classes with similar patterns of psychotherapy and antidepressant use. Data analysis took place between June 2016 and March 2017.\n    \n\n\n          Main outcomes and measures:\n        \n      \n      Psychotherapy and antidepressant use.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The cohort included 84 909 individuals with a mean (SD) age at index diagnosis of 15.0 (2.6) years, of whom 49 995 (59%) were female.

            "abstract": "Aim:\n        \n      \n      There is increasing concern regarding the use of cannabis among adolescents, especially given recent evidence highlighting its link with later mental disorders. Encouraging young people with mental health or drug issues to seek professional help is an important early intervention strategy; however, adolescents are typically reluctant to do so and instead turn to their peers for help. Peers may not have the skills or knowledge required to assist their friends to access professional help. This paper describes the development and evaluation of MAKINGtheLINK, a school-based health promotion programme that promotes help-seeking behaviour for mental health and cannabis use issues among young people.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The MAKINGtheLINK programme was piloted with 182 Year 10 students at a secondary school in Melbourne, Australia. Forty teachers received the MAKINGtheLINK staff professional development session.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The delivery of the MAKINGtheLINK programme was found to be both acceptable and feasible within a school setting. Students and teachers described it as a fun, engaging, helpful and important programme. Students reported increased confidence and awareness of how to seek help for themselves or a friend, and teachers indicated increased confidence and awareness of how to assist students to seek help for cannabis use and/or mental health problems.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      MAKINGtheLINK was successfully implemented within the school curriculum.

Despite the known efficacy of treatment and the substantial costs of untreated attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), access to healthcare and treatment is not a given for many patients in South Africa (SA). In SA, there is poor identification and treatment of common mental disorders at primary healthcare level and limited access to specialist resources with a service delivery and treatment gap of up to 75%. Medication options are also often limited in emerging markets and in SA psychiatrists, and patients do not have access to the medication armamentarium available in established markets. Furthermore, the majority of South Africans currently utilise the public healthcare sector and may not have access to treatment options referred to in these guidelines. These guidelines should therefore not be seen as a policy document.\n    \n\n\n          The process:\n        \n      \n      The South African Society of Psychiatrists' Special Interest Group (SIG) for adult ADHD was launched on 25 September 2015, with doctors Rykie Liebenberg and Renata Schoeman as convenor and co-convenor, respectively. The overall objective of the ADHD SIG is to improve the basket of care available to patients with ADHD. This is only possible through a combined and concerted effort of individuals with a special interest in and passion for ADHD to improve knowledge about and funding for the care of individuals with the disorder. One of the specific aims of the ADHD SIG was to develop South African guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adult ADHD specifically and update guidelines for the treatment of child, adolescent and adult ADHD. Dr Schoeman has recently completed her MBA at the University of Stellenbosch Business School with a thesis entitled 'A funding model proposal for private health insurance for adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the South African context'. This is first South African study exploring the situation with regard to the prevalence and treatment of adult ADHD. Dr Schoeman was tasked by the SIG with the drafting of guidelines. Dr Liebenberg provided valuable input. The guidelines were then circulated to the SIG members, as well as the Chair of the Public Sector SIG, for written feedback and evidence-based suggestions which were then incorporated into the guidelines. The final guidelines were circulated for written approval by the SIG members, followed by formal approval at a SIG meeting held on 14 August 2016, after which it was submitted to the South African Society of Psychiatrists (SASOP) and Psychiatry Management Group (PsychMG) boards for recommendation and ratification."

Among treatment-seeking youth, the SCARED showed good diagnostic utility and specificity, differentiating healthy, comorbid, and non-comorbid anxious youth. Child-parent agreement was modest: healthy child self-reports were higher than parent-reports whereas anxious child self-reports were similar or lower than parent-reports. Less consistent results emerged for diagnostic utility, specificity, and informant agreement among non-treatment-seeking youth. Given the number of non-treatment seeking anxious youth (N=33), generalizability of these findings may be limited.

This study examined associations between recent (past year) and distal (past 2-4 years) residential transience and past year major depressive episode (MDE) and mental health treatment in a nationally representative sample of US adolescents aged 12-17.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data are from the 2010-2014 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (n = ~107 300 adolescents).

Whilst some treatments exist for adults and school children, treatment options for young adults, at a particularly vulnerable time of life, are scarce. Understanding success mechanisms of existing youth mental health interventions is vital for informed development and scaling of interventions to address this critical gap. This rapid review identifies 27 recent health interventions addressing common youth mental disorders in Southern Africa. Eight studies that quantitatively measured success found significant mental health improvements as an intervention result. Studies that identified success via non-statistical means also found, albeit self-reported, generally favourable outcomes. No single best-practice intervention was identified to replicate throughout the region. Our review instead highlights three important mechanisms for intervention success: including youth in intervention design and delivery; indirectly addressing mental health; and developing multi-modal interventions. We recommend collaborative, ecological approaches to youth mental health interventions in Southern Africa."

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nThe study describes prevalence and rates of services and medication use and associated factors over time among Puerto Rican youths with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n## METHOD\nLongitudinal data are obtained on Puerto Rican children ages 5 through 13 years in the south Bronx in New York (n = 1,138) and two metropolitan areas in Puerto Rico (n = 1,353). The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-IV is the diagnostic tool. Five composite measures of risk factors: negative family influences, ineffective structuring, environmental risks, child risks, and maternal acceptance are constructed to relate services and medication use to risk variables.\n## RESULTS\nADHD prevalence is similar in Puerto Rico and the south Bronx. Overall mental health services, medication, and psychostimulant use is lower in Puerto Rico across three time points. Most participants never received treatment at any time point. More environmental risks, negative child traits, and low maternal warmth are associated with more services, even after adjusting for comorbidity. When risk variables are controlled, the effects of ADHD on services use decrease. Previous treatment is a strong predictor of subsequent treatment.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nRates of services and medication use are lower in Puerto Rico. Context seems to be more important than ethnicity in predicting mental health services and medication use among Puerto Rican children with ADHD. Other psychiatric diagnoses and general risk variables are important correlates of services and medication use.\n"

            "abstract": "Mobile health platforms have shown promise in the management of various mental health conditions (including stress, anxiety, and depression) and cognitive behavioral strategies emerged as a popular and effective option offered by the platforms. This paper presents the protocol of a study aimed to test the effectiveness of a mobile platform that uses cognitive-behavioral strategies for stress self-management in the Tuscany region (Italy). The mobile app is adapted to the specific needs of each vulnerable population for which it is designed: young and older people, healthcare professionals, entrepreneurs. The app will be evaluated on the following outcomes: (i) perceived susceptibility and severity of the pandemic situation, perceived benefits, and costs of preventive health behaviors, (ii) knowledge about Covid-19 preventive behaviors and negative consequences of social distancing, (iii) stress and psychopathological symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms) and cognitive distortions. If successful, we expect that the platform could give various groups clinical benefits by providing symptom self-monitoring and early intervention, consolidating the number of mental health programs available, and decreasing barriers to treatment-seeking. This population-level approach has the potential to improve mental health outcomes in pandemic periods for many people."

This topic is an extremely important one because the top three reasons teens die or get injured are related to accidents (3.7 per 100,000 for those ages 5-14 years and 28.5 per 100,000 for those ages 15-24 years), suicide (1 per 100,000 in the younger age group, and 12.5 deaths per 100,000 in those ages 5-14 years), and homicide (0.7 per 100,000 in those age 5-14 years, and 10.8 per 100,000 in those age 15-24 years). Each year, 21% of children ages 9 to 17 years are diagnosed with a mental or addictive disorder associated with at least minimum impairment, with 11% of these children having significant functional impairment and another 5% demonstrating extreme functional impairment. We know that one-half of all lifetime cases of mental health disorders start by age 14 years. This includes serious adult psychiatric illnesses such as major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse. Three-quarters are present by age 24 years; therefore, interventions aimed at prevention or early treatment need to focus on youth. [Pediatr Ann. 2018;47(7):e261-e265.]."

Prevention research should also focus largely on children and adolescents, with interventions targeted through sequential assessment at pivotal stages. The current problem of access to mental health care for youth in the adult mental health service system could be improved with additional funding and culture change - it is not necessary to create a new service system. Indeed, there are dangers in establishing new services for 12-25-year-olds, as the 12-17-year-old population has different needs from 18-25-year-olds. In particular, the younger group are at risk of 'adultification' by being grouped together with young adults, and this risk needs to be actively managed. Health service planning must pay attention to developmental differences. Several suggestions are proposed for addressing the mental health needs of young adults."

But how effective is remote care? To find out, PsycINFO and PubMed were searched from 1960 through 2020, supplemented by journal searches and reference trails, to identify randomized controlled trials of youth psychotherapy for anxiety (including obsessive-compulsive disorder and trauma), depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or conduct problems, in which all therapeutic contact occurred remotely. Articles (N = 37) published from 1988 through 2020, reporting 43 treatment-control group comparisons, were identified. Robust variance estimation was used to account for effect size dependencies and to synthesize overall effects and test candidate moderators. Pooled effect size was .47 (95% confidence interval [CI: .26, .67], p < .001) at posttreatment, .44 (95% CI [.12, .76], p < .05) at follow-up-comparable to effects reported in meta-analyses of in-person youth psychotherapy. Effects were significantly (a) larger for remote psychotherapies supported by therapeutic provider contact (.64) than for those accessed by youths, with only logistical support (.22), (b) larger for treatments with phone contact (.65) than for those without (.25), (c) larger for treatment of anxiety (.62) and conduct problems (.78) than ADHD (-.03), and (d) smaller for therapies involving attention/working memory training (-.18) than for those without (.60). Among studies with therapeutic contact, effects were significantly larger when therapists facilitated skill-building (e.g., practicing exposures or problem solving [.68]) than when therapists did not (.18). These findings support the effectiveness of remote psychotherapies for youths, and they highlight moderators of treatment benefit that warrant attention in future research.

Following Andersen's (1968; A behavioral model of families' use of health service, Center for Health Administration Studies) behavioral health model, predisposing (age, gender, marital status and education), need (anxiety and depressive symptoms) and enabling (acculturation, health insurance coverage and personal experience and beliefs) variables were considered. In the mean-level assessment, younger and older adults were found to hold a similar level of positive attitudes toward mental health services. In the multivariate analysis, culture-influenced beliefs were shown to have a substantial contribution to the model of attitudes toward mental health services in both age groups. The belief that depression is a medical condition was found to be a common predictor of positive attitudes across the groups. In the older adult sample, more negative attitudes were observed among those who believed that depression is a sign of personal weakness and that having a mentally ill family member brings shame to the whole family. Our findings show that older adults are not only more subject to cultural misconceptions and stigma related to mental disorders, but also their attitudes toward service use are negatively influenced by the cultural stigma. The findings provide important implications for interventions targeted to improve access to mental health care among minority populations. Based on the similarities and differences found between young and old, both general and age-specific strategies need to be developed in order to increase effectiveness of these programs."

Thus, although psychopathology is fairly common in this sample, many children with 22q11DS may not be receiving needed psychiatric care. These results have significant implications for these children and their families, as well as for the health care providers who treat them. In particular, the results may suggest a need for careful screening of psychiatric disorders that are likely to affect this population as well, as making appropriate treatment recommendations to remedy childhood mental health problems. Since these children face an extraordinarily high risk of psychoses in late adolescence/adulthood, treatment of childhood psychopathology could be crucial in mitigating the risk/consequences of major psychiatric illnesses in later life."

            "abstract": "The relationship between attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and white matter connectivity has not been well established yet, specially for children under 10 years of age. In addition, the effects of treatment on brain structure have not been sufficiently explored from a Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) perspective. In this study, the influence of treatment with methylphenidate in the white matter of children with ADHD was investigated using two different and complementary DTI analysis methods: Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and a robust tractography selection method. No significant differences were found in Fractional Anisotropy (FA) between medicated, drug-naïve patients and healthy controls, but a reduced Mean Diffusivity (MD) was found in ADHD patients under treatment with respect to both healthy controls and drug-naïve ADHD patients. Also, correlations were found between MD increases and performance indicators of ADHD. These findings may help elucidate the nature of white matter alterations in ADHD, their relationship with symptoms and the effects of treatment with psychostimulants."

This study examines explanatory models of treatment among 40 second-generation Cambodian children aged 8-18 and their parents in the US. Comparisons of perceptions of intervention for an externalizing problem (gang-related behavior) and an internalizing problem (depression) are made in a group of children who have received mental health services, their parents, and a matched community sample. A significant interaction between respondent and group membership was present in the perception that these problems could be helped, and contrary to past findings among Asian Americans, both children and parents generally endorsed the use of mental health services. Data about actual experiences with mental health services are used to help explain the findings and suggest implications for treatment of Cambodian-American youth."

In order to define more appropriate targets for innovative pharmacological therapies for disruptive/conduct disorders, the European Commission within the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) funded the MATRICS project (Multidisciplinary Approaches to Translational Research in Conduct Syndromes) to identify neural, genetic, and molecular factors underpinning the pathogenesis of aggression/antisocial behavior in preclinical models and clinical samples. Within the program, a multicentre case-control study, followed by a single-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, randomized acute single-dose medication challenge, was conducted at two Italian sites. Aggressive children and adolescents with conduct disorder (CD) or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) were compared to the same age (10-17 y) typically developing controls (TDC) on a neuropsychological tasks battery that included both \"cold\" (e.g., inhibitory control, decision making) and \"hot\" executive functions (e.g., moral judgment, emotion processing, risk assessment). Selected autonomic measures (heart rate variability, skin conductance, salivary cortisol) were recorded before/during/after neuropsychological testing sessions. The acute response to different drugs (methylphenidate/atomoxetine, risperidone/aripiprazole, or placebo) was also examined in the ODD/CD cohort in order to identify potential neuropsychological/physiological mechanisms underlying aggression.

Overall, considering that around 65% of young adults with childhood ADHD present with impairing ADHD symptoms and up to 90% of individuals with ADHD may benefit from ADHD medications, the study by Price et al shows that the rate of appropriate treatment for youngsters in the transition period varies from low to very low across the UK. As such, there is a continuous need for education and training for patients, their families, mental health professionals and commissioners, to eradicate the misconception that, in the majority of the cases, ADHD remits during adolescence and to support the devolvement of appropriate services for the evidence-based management of adult ADHD across the UK."

However, little is known about treatment adherence in teenage and young adult (TYA) patients with cancer. To increase awareness of the adherence challenges faced by these patients, we have reviewed the published work. The available evidence suggests that a substantial proportion of TYA patients with cancer do have difficulties, with reports that up to 63% of patients do not adhere to their treatment regimens. However, with inconsistent findings across studies, the true extent of non-adherence for these young patients is still unclear. Furthermore, it is apparent that there are many components of the cancer treatment regimen that have yet to be assessed in relation to patient adherence. Factors that have been shown to affect treatment adherence in TYA patients include patient emotional functioning (depression and self-esteem), patient health beliefs (perceived illness severity and vulnerability), and family environment (parental support and parent-child concordance). Strategies that foster greater patient adherence are also identified. These strategies are multifactorial, targeting not only the patient, but the health professional, family, and treatment regimen. This review highlights the lack of interventional studies addressing treatment adherence in TYA patients with cancer, with only one such intervention being identified: a video game intervention focusing on behavioural issues related to cancer treatment and care. Methodological issues in measuring adherence are addressed and suggestions for improving the design of future adherence studies highlighted, of which there is a great need."

A high prevalence of morbidity and comorbidity is associated with dysthymia: major depression, alcoholism, anxiety and personality disorders are present in the vast majority of sufferers. It is also very unusual for people with dysthymia to not develop superimposed episodes of major depressive disorder, resulting in a longer time to recover and high rates of recurrence and chronicity. Approximately 3.1% of the population have dysthymia including children and adolescents who, like adults, exhibit a higher risk for new episodes of depressive illness if they have this disorder. Children and adolescents with depressive illnesses have higher rates of scholastic failure and school-related problems. Dysthymia can affect every aspect of a person's quality of life including relationships with significant others, earning potential and, most importantly, mental and physical well-being. Available data is not yet sufficient to differentiate dysthymia as a disease entity from the other depressive disorders such as major depression or double depression, or to conclude to what extent dysthymia should be thought of as a personality disorder. However, the DSM-IV Mood Disorders Field Trial results help identify new criteria for the DSM-IV Appendix.

However, psychometric studies of the most commonly used measure of IU have typically used undergraduate students, and the factor structure has been highly inconsistent.

The first aim of this study was to test the latent structure of a commonly used measure of IU in a treatment-seeking sample with anxiety and depression (n=463). The second aim was to examine psychometric properties of the best fitting solution, including internal reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to compare the goodness of fit of five models previously found with undergraduate and community samples. A two-factor solution, comprising of prospective anxiety and inhibitory anxiety, was the best fitting model. The total scale and subscales demonstrated excellent internal reliability. Convergent validity was demonstrated by the scales correlating with symptoms associated with five anxiety disorders and depression, as well as neuroticism, distress and disability. IU explained unique variance in all symptom measures, even after controlling for neuroticism and other symptom measures. Evidence of discriminant validity was also found for each IU subscale. Findings support reliability and validity of the two-factor solution, and are consistent with IU being a transdiagnostic maintaining factor."

Nine of the 16 women with PMDD and a past PPD had either a past major depressive episode (MDE) or subsyndromal anxiety disorder. Thirty-three women (15.3%) had a past history of an Axis I anxiety disorder. A total of 40 women (18.6%) met criteria for past alcohol or drug abuse, 3 (1.4%) met criteria for bulimia nervosa, and 2 (0.9%) met criteria for anorexia nervosa.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our data demonstrate that PMDD and PPD do not frequently co-occur. These data do not suggest that PMDD and PPD share similar pathophysiology beyond being ovarian-steroid-triggered mood disorders. The high comorbidity of past MDE could contribute to the increased risk both for future MDE and for PPD in some women with PMDD."

            "abstract": "Objective: Despite the association between childhood ADHD and long-term negative outcomes, there is a significant delay to treatment and a low rate of lifetime treatment contact for individuals with ADHD. Method: The current study examined (a) variables associated with parental treatment-seeking attitudes and information-seeking behaviors and (b) the relationship between these attitudes and behaviors in 87 non-treatment-seeking parents whose children had elevated ADHD symptoms. Results: Regressions indicated that attitudes toward ADHD treatment were associated with ADHD knowledge and misconceptions (ps < .01), susceptibility to ADHD stigma (p < .001), and satisfaction with past providers (ps < .01). Experience with past providers was significantly associated with information-seeking behavior (ps < .01). Conclusion: Parental knowledge of ADHD, low levels of stigma, and positive experiences with past providers were the strongest predictors of positive attitudes about ADHD treatment. Experience with past providers was the only factor related to treatment-seeking behavior. These results offer avenues to decreasing barriers to treatment in pediatric ADHD."

            "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the resumption of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) prescriptions in early adulthood in young people whose ADHD prescriptions stopped in adolescence. Whilst prescribing studies indicate that the proportion of those with ADHD stopping treatment in late adolescence remains in excess of the proportion expected to be symptom free, very few studies have examined patterns of resumption amongst young adults previously prescribed medication. Primary care records from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink from 2008 to 2013 were used to examine the outcome of resumption of ADHD prescriptions from age 20 years in a sample of cases with ADHD whose prescriptions stopped aged 14-18 years. A Cox regression model was fitted to explore variables that could theoretically be associated with resumption of prescriptions. Of 1440 cases, 109 (7.6%) had their ADHD prescriptions resumed. Characteristics associated with an increased probability of resumption included female gender, learning disability, referral to adult mental health services, and prescription of antipsychotic medication. In this study, only a small proportion of adolescents who stopped ADHD medication subsequently resumed their prescriptions in primary care. Those that did resume were a more complex group. As many vulnerable individuals with ongoing ADHD symptoms may not have the resources required to surmount the barriers to re-enter services, the implication is that not all those who could benefit from resuming medication are able to do so. The findings raise questions around whether current care models are flexible enough and whether primary care services are adequately supported in managing this group."

We conducted focus groups with caregivers of Medicaid-enrolled children with ADHD and semi-structured interviews with providers and administrators at four safety net clinics that provided mental health care to these youth. Stakeholders reported that prior authorization policies for psychosocial services, restrictiveness of preferred drug lists, and changes in preferred drug lists in Medicaid plans created barriers to treatment continuity and quality for youth with ADHD and led to more administrative burden for safety-net clinics serving these youth."

            "abstract": "Children with conduct disorders (CD) and their families are in contact with multiple agencies, but there is limited evidence on their patterns of service utilization. The aim of this study was to establish the patterns, barriers and correlates of service use by analysing the cohort of the 2004 Great Britain child mental health survey (N = 7,977). Use of social services was significantly higher by children with CD than emotional disorders (ED) in the absence of co-morbidity, while use of specialist child mental health and paediatric was significantly higher by children with hyperkinetic disorders (HD) than CD. Children who had comorbid physical disorders used more primary healthcare services compared to those without physical disorders. Utilization of specialist child mental heath and social services was significantly higher among children with unsocialized CD than socialized CD and oppositional defiant disorders. Services utilization and its correlates varied with the type of service. Overall, specialist services use was associated with co-morbidity with learning disabilities, physical and psychiatric disorders. Several correlates of services use in CD appeared non-specific, i.e. associated with use of different services indicating the possibility of indiscriminate use of different types of services. The findings led to the conclusion that there is the need for effective organization and co-ordination of services, and clear care pathways. Involvement of specialist child mental health services should be requested in the presence of mental health co-morbidity."

Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine racial/ethnic differences in mental health care utilization.\n## RESULTS\nNine percent of parents reported that their child had ever used mental health care services; fewer black (6%) and Hispanic (8%) children had used services than white children (14%). Fewer black and Hispanic children with recent symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, and fewer black children with symptoms of depression had ever utilized services compared with white children. In multivariate analyses controlling for demographic factors, parental mental health, social support, and symptoms of the 4 mental health conditions, we found that black children were less likely than white children to have ever used services (Odds ratio [OR] 0.3, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.2-0.4, P < .001). The odds ratio for black children remained virtually unchanged when the analysis was restricted to children with symptoms of >/=1 mental health condition, and when the analysis was stratified by mental health condition. The difference in utilization for Hispanic compared with white children was fully explained by sociodemographics in all multivariate models.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDisparities exist in mental health care utilization for black and Hispanic children; the disparity for black children is independent of sociodemographics and child mental health need. Efforts to reduce this disparity may benefit from addressing not only access and diagnosis issues, but also parents' help-seeking preferences for mental health care for their children.\n"

Forty-two HIV-positive youth (25 males, 17 females; age range 16 - 24) currently taking antiretroviral medications were recruited to participate in a one-hour interview. Using the time-line follow-back calendar method, 66% of participants had missed a dose of medicine in the past week while 42% missed a dose 'yesterday'. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that both depression and age of first marijuana use were statistically significant predictors of non-adherence (p < .01, R2 = .326). Specifically, higher rates of depressive symptoms and younger age of first marijuana use predicted higher rates of non-adherence. Developmentally, 69% of the sample had yet to begin the transition from concrete thinking to formal or abstract reasoning. The results from this project demonstrate that adherence to antiretroviral medications continues to be a problem with HIV-infected youth.

Pre-post effect sizes showed medium-to-large improvements in adherence, lasting through a 12-week follow-up assessment. There were also small-to-medium changes in adherence barriers, social support, and depression. However, acceptability and feasibility were limited, due to a low rate of enrollment by eligible male participants.

            "abstract": "Lower income mothers who bring their children for mental health services also have high rates of depression and anxiety, yet few seek help. Maternal and child mental health are intimately intertwined; thus, the distress of both is likely to continue if the mother's needs are unaddressed. Because mothers overcome numerous instrumental challenges to help their children, the authors identify potential perceptual barriers to mothers' help seeking. An ethnographic analysis of in-depth qualitative interviews with 127 distressed mothers suggests several critical perceptual factors. For example, mothers attributed their distress to external causes (e.g., poverty, negative life stressors), which they believed individually focused mental health services could not affect. Interviewees also anticipated negative ramifications for seeking care, including being labeled unfit mothers, and thus potentially losing custody of their children. The authors discuss the implications of these and other key themes for engaging lower income mothers and their children."

This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a minimally monitored transdiagnostic iCBT program translated from English to French and offered in Canada for the treatment of anxiety and depression among young adults. The impact of the program on resilience was also assessed. Twenty-five participants from community and university samples were included in the analyses in two separate single-group feasibility trials with a 3-month follow-up. Feasibility outcomes were attrition, adherence, treatment acceptability and treatment gains. Outcome measures included the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). In Trial 1 (N = 10), recruiting among the general population proved to be challenging. Low adherence (20%) and high attrition (80%) rates were observed. Methodological changes to recruitment were made and a second trial was conducted among university students using incentives (N = 15). About half of the participants completed treatment (55%, n = 8/15), 12/15 provided post-treatment data and 8/15 provided 3-month follow-up data. All study completers (100%; n = 14) reported they would recommend the program. Mixed effects model analyses revealed significant and large pre-post treatment reductions on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 (Cohen's d = 1.09 and 1.64 respectively) with treatment gains maintained at follow-up. Moderate improvements were found on the CD-RISC post-treatment with further gains at follow-up (ds = 0.55 and 1.10 respectively). These finding suggest that future research on this French-Canadian version of the Mood Mechanic Course is feasible with appropriate attention to recruitment. Translating existing iCBT interventions and using minimal monitoring may be an optimal first step to initiate the cross-cultural dissemination of iCBT while increasing access to treatments among young adults.

Parental education was associated with treatment utilization.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These high prevalence estimates coupled with low service utilization rates suggest that a greater priority should be given to adolescent mental health in Mexico and to public health policy that both expands the availability of mental health services directed at the adolescent population and reduces barriers to the utilization of existing services."

            "abstract": "This paper presents findings from a UK mixed-method study that aimed to understand parents/carers' views and experiences of support received from health services for primary school age (4-11) gender diverse children and their families. Data was collected via an e-survey including 10 open-ended questions with 75 parents/carers addressing experiences with (i) primary health services, including general practice (GP) clinics and child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) (ii) specialist gender identity development services (GIDS) (iii) non-health related support including transgender groups and online resources. Findings are organised into four themes: 'journey to health service provision', 'view on health services used', 'waiting' and 'isolation'. Discourses about gender diversity, childhood and the validity of trans healthcare shape parental experiences, including their desire for better information, more certainty in healthcare pathways and more expedient access to support services to reduce anxiety, distress and isolation. The emotional costs of waiting are compounded by the material costs of accessing the limited number of specialist services. Experiences could be improved through ensuring GPs and CAMHS are better prepared, expanding access to trans-specific support groups for those caring for children and young people, and exploring the provision of school-based support for gender diverse primary-age children."

            "abstract": "The diagnosis of ADHD among teens and young adults has been associated with a higher likelihood of motor vehicle crashes. Some studies suggest a beneficial effect of ADHD medication but the exact efficacy is still being debated. Further, medication adherence, which is low in this age group, can further reduce effectiveness. Our long-term objective is to reduce unsafe driving among drivers with ADHD by detecting medication non-adherence through driver behavior modeling and monitoring. As a first step, we developed the described lab study protocol to obtain reliable driver behavior data that will then be used to design and train behavior models built through machine learning. This experimental study protocol was developed to systematically compare driving behaviors under two medication conditions (before and after intake of medication) among young adults with ADHD and a control group of non-ADHD. A driving simulator was used to examine driving behaviors and interactions with traffic. The primary outcome was speed management for two comparisons (ADHD vs. non-ADHD and before vs. after medication), and secondary objectives involved understanding differences among the participants utilizing self-reported surveys about ADHD symptoms, drivers' knowledge, and perception about safety. The study protocol was designed to maximize participant safety and efficiency of data collection, as multiple measures were collected over two 2-h study visits. The sampled ADHD drivers were demographically and psychosocially similar but clinically different from the non-ADHD group. Overall, this protocol was effective in participant recruitment and retention, allowed staggered data collection, and can be incorporated in a subsequent clinical trial that examines the efficacy of a machine-learning based driver monitoring intervention."

This article presents results from a national survey of 36 mental health National Health Service (NHS) trusts across England, the findings indicate a lack of accurate data on the number of young people with ADHD transitioning to, and being seen by, adult services. Less than half of the trusts had a specialist adult ADHD service and in only a third of the trusts were there specific commissioning arrangements for adult ADHD. Half of the trusts reported that young people with ADHD were prematurely discharged from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) because there were no suitable adult services. There was also a lack of written transition protocols, care pathways, commissioned services for adults with ADHD and inadequate information sharing between services. The findings advocate the need to provide a better transition service underpinned by clear, structured guidelines and protocols, routine data collection and information sharing across child and adult services. An increase in the commission of specialist adult ADHD clinics is needed to ensure individuals have access to appropriate support and care."

This review aims to determine the prevalence of mental health problems among university students in six ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries (Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam) and to identify the determinants of mental health. A systematic database search (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubPsych, and Scopus) for peer-reviewed, English language articles, published 2010-2020, reporting prevalence data based on standardized screening instruments resulted in 335 articles; 108 were eligible for full-text analysis, of which 34 could be included in the review. Median point prevalence was 29.4% for depression, 42.4% for anxiety, 16.4% for stress, and 13.9% for disordered eating. Current suicidality was present in 7% to 8% of students. There was a high rate of psychiatric comorbidity. Despite the high prevalence of mental health problems, the willingness to seek professional help was comparatively low.

However, the prevalence of mental health problems such as depression among children and young people with autism is high. One in 10 children and young people who use Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) has autism. Recent research by The National Autistic Society (NAS) into the effectiveness of these services has revealed a serious lack of understanding and support, with some families reporting that they have had to wait for years to receive help. The research involved a survey of 455 parents of children and young people with autism, together with qualitative findings from parental and young people's focus groups, a survey of CAMHS professionals and visits to CAMHS sites. Responses from parents, young people and professionals indicated that CAMHS did not have the knowledge or the skills to identify or treat mental health problems in children with autism.This can have profound consequences for the health and well-being of the whole family. Autism is a complex disability that can make it harder to diagnose concomitant mental health problems. It is a condition that can make it more difficult for professionals to develop successful, trusting relationships with children, and requires services to be adapted to the individual child. Mainstream interventions and treatments, if unadjusted, will usually fail to improve the mental health of a child with autism and may even make things worse.This article explores how CAMHS services might better meet the needs of children with autism and their families, including improvements in the transition to adult mental health services. In June 2010 NAS launched You Need to Know, a campaign calling on the Government to give priority to improving CAMHS services for children with autism and to support loca areas in delivering the changes that families and front-line professionals are calling for."

Yet, the connection between cannabis use and trait anger remains poorly characterized. The present study sought to investigate the relationship between cannabis use and self-reported trait anger in youth seeking substance use treatment. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted on youth (n=168) aged 14-26 presenting for an initial evaluation at an outpatient substance use treatment program. Patients self-reported trait anger score (TAS) and lifetime, recent, and Diagnostic and Statistics Manual-5th Edition diagnostic status of cannabis use were assessed. Clinician-coded psychiatric and substance use patterns were collected, along with urine carboxy delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration levels. Additional measures of anxiety, depression, and demographic variables were assessed. Results: Higher self-reported TAS were associated with cannabis use, cannabis use disorder (CUD), and more recent and frequent cannabis use. The presence of a CUD was independently associated with TAS after controlling for the presence of other substance use disorders and co-occurring depression and anxiety disorders. Higher urine THC concentration levels were associated with higher TAS. Conclusions: Findings support an association between heavy, chronic cannabis use and elevated self-reported trait anger at intake. There may be important neurological consequences of heavy, chronic cannabis use that impact anger regulation. It is also plausible that trait anger maybe a predisposing factor for elevated cannabis use. Better controlled prospective research is needed to help determine directionality.

            "abstract": "Remarkable progress has been made in developing psychosocial interventions for a broad range of psychiatric disorders for children, adolescents, and adults. In addition many efforts are well underway to address the research-practice gap, which refers to the dissemination evidence-based treatments from controlled settings to clinical care. The present article focuses on the treatment gap, which refers to the discrepancy in the proportion of the population in need of services and the proportion that actually receives them. Currently, in the United States (and worldwide), the vast majority of individuals in need of mental health services receive no treatment. Although there are many reasons, the dominant model of delivering psychosocial interventions in both research and clinical practice makes it difficult to scale treatment to reach the large swaths of individuals in need. That model includes one-to-one, in person treatment, with a trained mental health professional, and provided in clinical setting (e.g., clinic, private practice office, health-care facility). The article discusses the development of delivery models that would permit reaching more individuals in need, highlights criteria for developing such models, and illustrates novel models already available. The article proposes that our next challenge is to reach individuals in need with the many excellent interventions we have developed but through a diversified set of delivery models."

            "abstract": "Depression is one of the highest prevalent mental illnesses and is one of the common illnesses that can have its onset during childhood or adolescence. It is estimated that up to 20% of children experience mental illness worldwide. Preventing the onset of depression in children and adolescents should be a vital public health goal that will improve public health and decrease health care costs. We reviewed literature that described school-based interventions to prevent the onset of depression, reduce the severity of depressive symptoms, and enhance global functioning in adolescents. Our research also provides strategies for school-based intervention programs that are mainly categorized into three main subtypes. We also discussed each subtype and its advantages and limitations. The goal is to bring the readers an understanding of the importance of preventing depression on a community level, beginning at schools."

This study assessed trends in mental health among Canadian youth, 12-24 years old.

Prevalence of mental health outcomes was calculated from each survey, and meta-regression was used to assess trends over time. In the absence of a significant trend over time, the eight cycles were pooled together using meta-analysis techniques to gain precision. Trends in prevalence were assessed for the overall sample of youth (12-24 years) and separately for male and female adolescents (12-18 years) and young adults (19-24 years).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of poor/fair perceived mental health, diagnosed mood and anxiety disorders, and past-year mental health consultations increased from 2011 to 2018, most strongly among young adult females.

Notably, the prevalence of binge drinking decreased by 2.4% per year for young adult males, 1.0% for young adult females and 0.7% per year for adolescent males, while staying relatively stable for adolescent females. Prevalence of cannabis use declined among adolescents before legalisation (2011-2017); however, this trend did not persist in 2018. Instead, the 2018 prevalence was 5.6% higher than the 2017 prevalence (16.3 v. 10.7%).

This study examined addiction severity in patients with co-occurring addictive disorders and ADHD controlling for the potential influence of associated psychiatric comorbidity. Data were collected in French outpatient addiction treatment centers. A total of 217 patients seeking treatment for substance or gambling addiction were included. At treatment entry, participants were interviewed with the Addiction Severity Index, the Conners Adult ADHD Diagnosis Interview for the DSM-IV (CAADID), the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II for borderline personality disorder (SCID II). History of ADHD was associated with an earlier onset of addiction, poly-dependence (defined by presence of at least two current substance dependence diagnoses in addition to tobacco dependence if present) and borderline personality disorder. Persistence of ADHD during adulthood was associated with a higher prevalence of poly-dependence. This study highlights the need for early implementation of preventive interventions for substance use or behavioral addiction in children/adolescents with ADHD and the need to consider ADHD in the treatment of addictive disorders."

The present commentary focuses on treatment strategies that might improve effects of ADHD medication treatment by improving adherence in adolescents with ADHD and/or optimise behavioural interventions for ADHD in adolescence. Most treatment strategies in adolescents with ADHD are merely copied from treatments offered to children. Instead however treatment should be focused on what makes adolescents special and vulnerable, such as poor insight into own functioning and poor decision making. Techniques that offer promise for adolescents are motivational interviewing, use of ecological momentary assessments and interventions, mindfulness-based training and serious games. Systematic studies into the effects of these techniques alone and in combination with medication are lacking."

Need factors: There was consistent evidence of an association between service utilisation and self-evaluated health status; duration of symptoms; disability; comorbidity; and panic symptoms. Associations with symptom severity were frequently but less consistently reported. Enabling factors: The evidence did not support an association with income or rural residence.

Yet, very little is known about the current situation of depression and its associated stigma in this region. The purpose of this pilot study was to obtain preliminary data examining clinically significant depressive symptoms, depression stigma, and attitudes towards seeking professional help for depression among a sample of Arab adolescents from Jordan. Cross-sectional data were collected from 88 adolescents attending public schools in Jordan using self-report questionnaires that were available in, or translated into, Arabic. Among the 88 adolescents, 22% reported scores suggesting mild depression and 19% reported scores suggesting moderate depression, while 24% reported scores suggesting severe depression. The most frequently reported depressive symptoms were changes in sleep patterns (76%), changes in appetite (63%), agitation (62%), and crying (61%). The majority (73%) had moderate depression stigma, and 43% had negative attitudes towards seeking professional help. Yet, 67% believed they would find relief in psychotherapy if they ever had a serious emotional crisis. Findings suggest that the prevalence of depressive symptoms may be high among Jordanian adolescents. Further, many of these adolescents may experience depression-related stigma that affects their attitudes and willingness to seek professional help. To determine the true scope of these issues, including the prevalence of depression among Jordanian adolescents, future research should obtain data from a nationally representative sample."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Mental disorders are more common in young adults than at any other life stage. Despite this, young people have low rates of seeking professional help for mental health problems. Young elite athletes have less positive attitudes toward seeking help than nonathletes and thus may be particularly unlikely to seek help. Interventions aimed at increasing help-seeking in young elite athletes are warranted.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To test the feasibility and efficacy of three Internet-based interventions designed to increase mental health help-seeking attitudes, intentions, and behavior in young elite athletes compared with a control condition.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of three brief fully automated Internet-based mental health help-seeking interventions with 59 young elite athletes recruited online in a closed trial in Australia. The interventions consisted of a mental health literacy and destigmatization condition, a feedback condition providing symptom levels, and a minimal content condition comprising a list of help-seeking resources, compared with a control condition (no intervention). We measured help-seeking attitudes, intentions and behavior using self-assessed surveys. Participation was open to elite athletes regardless of their mental health status or risk of mental illness.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 120 athletes initially agreeing to participate, 59 (49%) submitted a preintervention or postintervention survey, or both, and were included in the present study. Adherence was satisfactory, with 48 (81%) participants visiting both weeks of assigned intervention material. None of the interventions yielded a significant increase in help-seeking attitudes, intentions, or behavior relative to control. However, at postintervention, there was a trend toward a greater increase in help-seeking behavior from formal sources for the mental health literacy/destigmatization condition compared with control (P = .06). This intervention was also associated with increased depression literacy (P = .003, P = .005) and anxiety literacy (P = .002, P = .001) relative to control at postintervention and 3-month follow-up, respectively, and a reduction in depression stigma relative to control at postintervention (P = .01, P = .12) and anxiety stigma at 3-month follow-up (P = .18, P = .02). The feedback and help-seeking list interventions did not improve depression or anxiety literacy or decrease stigmatizing attitudes to these conditions. However, the study findings should be treated with caution. Due to recruitment challenges, the achieved sample size fell significantly short of the target size and the study was underpowered. Accordingly, the results should be considered as providing preliminary pilot data only.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This is the first RCT of an Internet-based mental health help-seeking intervention for young elite athletes. The results suggest that brief mental health literacy and destigmatization improves knowledge and may decrease stigma but does not increase help-seeking.

            "abstract": "Supporting children and young people (CYP) who self-harm (SH) is an important work of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). This theme is reflected in three papers in this issue. Starting with risk factors, Marraccini and colleagues found that compared with adolescents, preadolescent children with suicidal behavior were more likely to be male, from a Black ethnic background, or to have a neurodevelopmental disorder such as autism spectrum condition (ASC) or ADHD. These authors' finding of increased school-related stressors emphasizes the importance of educational adjustments in reducing the risk of SH among CYP with ASC and ADHD. Ward and Curran's study suggests that screening for ADHD symptoms among CYP who present with SH may improve early identification of those affected by ADHD-especially among females. Finally, Ramsey and colleagues found that coupling dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) with a specific intervention targeting self-criticism reduced episodes of SH more than standard DBT alone. Given the link between SH and suicide, improving understanding of the risk factors, early identification, and new treatment options for SH remain important."

            "abstract": "It is known that youth engaged in the juvenile justice system show high rates of psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about the course of those disorders over time, or about mental health service use on the part of children and families during justice system involvement. Boys and girls recruited from their first contact with juvenile court (n=75), at a mean age of 13.6 years, completed three waves of interviews, each consisting of a structured clinical interview and questionnaires regarding service use, family functioning, parental burden, parental psychopathology. High rates of psychiatric disorders were evident. Three quarters (n = 56) met criteria for a mood, anxiety or behavioral disorder by parent or child report. Despite the high prevalence of mental health concerns, relatively few youth (approximately 20%) were involved in mental health services in follow-up waves. The presence of ODD and higher levels of family communication problems were associated with involvement in mental health services. Although parents experienced burden associated with their child's mental health problems, burden was not a strong correlate of help-seeking. Mental health problems declined from the point of initial involvement with juvenile justice; only ODD symptoms showed stability over time. Low rates of engagement in mental health services are found for juveniles subsequent to their first contact with juvenile justice. ODD and family communication problems most influenced service engagement, while burden due to mental health problems did not. The results provide potential targets for efforts to enhance parental motivation towards service engagement."

PMAD are a global health issue that can have devastating effects on the mental, physical, emotional, developmental health, and social life of the mother, infant, and family. Adolescents present with similar symptoms of PMAD as their adult counterparts, but also experience isolation from their peer group and lack of resources and coping strategies, as well as difficulty sleeping and lack of concentration and ability to focus. Nurses and nurse practitioners are in an ideal position to assess preexisting risk factors for PMAD. The current applied evidence-based article addresses the diagnosis of PMAD, provides a conceptual framework for understanding the intra- and interpersonal dynamics affecting teens with PMAD, and suggests a new screening tool to guide diagnosis. An easy to recall mnemonic for diagnosis and referral (SAIL AHEAD) is proposed. By using the SAIL AHEAD mnemonic, providers will impact adolescents' parenting success and resiliency, thereby enhancing their future success in life.

Despite this recognition, adult ADHD remains underdiagnosed. This narrative review describes the negative impact of ADHD across multiple functional domains, diagnostic guidelines for adult ADHD and its clinical features, the importance of screening tools and clinical interviews to help evaluate adults for ADHD, and adult ADHD treatment options. Diagnostic guidelines for ADHD now incorporate adult-specific symptoms and behavioral manifestations, which may aid in diagnosing adult ADHD. However, diagnosis of ADHD is complicated by symptom overlap between ADHD and psychiatric disorders that might be comorbid with ADHD. Screening tools, such as the Adult ADHD Self-Report Screening Scale for DSM-5, can identify adults requiring evaluation for ADHD. However, clinical interviews and longitudinal family histories provide critical information that diagnoses ADHD and differentiates ADHD from psychiatric comorbidities. Various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments are available for adults diagnosed with ADHD. First-line pharmacologic treatment of ADHD usually consists of treatment with a psychostimulant, and a variety of short-acting and long-acting formulations are available for use in adults. When developing a treatment plan for adults with ADHD, it is important to recognize that the demands of adult life, both at work and at home, necessitate symptom control throughout the entire day and into the evening and indicate that a long-acting medication formulation is often preferable. Furthermore, there are important safety concerns, including the potential for drug dependence and serious cardiovascular events, which must be considered before prescribing stimulants.​."

Parents' opinions were compared with an orthodontist's assessment of treatment need. Parents' anxiety about their child's dentition coincided in 60 per cent with the orthodontist's assessment, agreement being stronger for malocclusions affecting the anterior teeth.

A 5-point Likert scale was used. The ADHD group was 49, and the general students group was 245. The data were compared using the chi-squared test. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 24, with statistical significance at P < 0.05.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The ADHD group was significantly high who reported severely beating other people than the general group. Likewise, ADHD group who reported threatening other people was significantly higher than in the general group. However, for the remaining items, there was no significant difference between the ADHD group and the general student group.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Previous studies suggested that ADHD symptoms are major causes of both bullying and being the victim of bullying. However, in this study, ADHD patients have more being the victim of bullying experiences than general students. Further, a well-designed study will be needed to accurately evaluate the relationship between school violence and ADHD."

            "abstract": "The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is widely used to assess behavioral and emotional problems in youth. The CBCL Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-Oriented Anxiety Problems subscale (CBCL-AP) was developed for the identification of DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Using data from 298 youth aged 6- to 18, the CBCL-AP scale was examined to determine its ability to differentially predict, via Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis, the presence of (a) generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), (b) separation anxiety disorder (SAD), (c) specific phobia (SPPH), or (d) the presence of any of these disorders. Independent Evaluators (IEs) administered the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children (ADIS-C/P) to determine the presence of an anxiety disorder. The ability of the CBCL-AP to predict to anxiety disorders was compared to the ability of the CBCL Anxious/Depressed (CBCL-A/D) scale and the seven empirically derived CBCL syndrome subscales and five DSM-Oriented subscales to predict anxiety disorder diagnoses. Results revealed that CBCL-AP scores significantly predicted all diagnoses. CBCL-A/D scores significantly predicted SAD (AUC = 0.67), GAD (AUC = 0.69), and the presence of any of the three disorders (AUC = 0.72), but not the presence of SPPH (AUC = 0.52). Although the CBCL-AP scale may not be a substitute for extensive diagnostics, it has demonstrated utility as an instrument for assessing anxiety and can serve to identify anxious youth in need of mental health services."

More maltreating caregivers received mental health services than did their children, but this still only accounted for half of the parents.

Unfortunately, these systems of care are poorly connected, which may result in care that is fragmented and suboptimal. This article describes the development and implementation of an electronic health record portal, known as the ADHD Care Assistant, to facilitate the sharing of information between schools and primary care offices to promote the use of evidence-based practices for managing children with behavioral health conditions. A feasibility study was conducted across 19 diverse primary care practices with 105 participating providers. Across the practices, 67% of providers activated the system for at least one patient and 32% activated it for five or more cases. Care Assistant use was lower in practices with a relatively high percentage of Medicaid patients (≥ 25%).

Yet, whereas alexithymia has been extensively studied in adults with a substance misuse, only one study has reported data on cannabis abusers from the general population. Hence, our main objective was to explore alexithymia in a clinical sample of treatment-seeking young outpatients with a DSM-IV cannabis dependence or abuse diagnosis compared to controls.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      120 young patients (95 males - mean age 17.9years (SD=2.8; 14 to 25)) with a cannabis dependence or abuse (DSM-IV-TR criteria evaluated with the MINI), seeking treatment in an addiction unit, and 110 healthy control subjects (77 males - mean age 18.2years (SD=3.4; 14 to 25)) participated in the study.

This article reports on the characteristics of anxiety symptoms in young children with autism spectrum disorder using a parent-completed rating scale. One hundred and eighty children (age 3-7 years) participated in a clinical trial of parent training for disruptive behaviors. Anxiety was measured as part of pre-treatment subject characterization with 16 items from the Early Childhood Inventory, a parent-completed scale on child psychiatric symptoms. Parents also completed other measures of behavioral problems. Sixty-seven percent of children were rated by their parents as having two or more clinically significant symptoms of anxiety. There were no differences in the Early Childhood Inventory anxiety severity scores of children with IQ < 70 and those with ⩾70. Higher levels of anxiety were associated with severity of oppositional defiant behavior and social disability. Anxiety symptoms are common in preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder. These findings are consistent with earlier work in school-age children with autism spectrum disorder. There were no differences in anxiety between children with IQ below 70 and those with IQ of 70 and above.

This study describes the mental health of 1,336 treatment-seeking deployed U.S. military personnel and interventions recommended by military mental health providers in Iraq from January 2006 to January 2007. Cases were primarily young enlisted men, most of whom were on their first combat deployment. Marines made up the majority of the cases (60%), but there were also large numbers of Army and Navy personnel. The most common psychiatric diagnoses were anxiety disorders (31%, including 11% with posttraumatic stress disorder), followed by adjustment (27%) and mood disorders (25%, including 22% with depression). Medication was the most commonly prescribed treatment for patients with psychiatric diagnoses but was often combined with recommendations for psychotherapy/counseling and/or behavioral modifications. The findings illustrate the distribution of mental health conditions seen among treatment-seeking troops while actively serving in a combat environment and the interventions recommended for them.

This cross-sectional study investigated whether self-reported and parent-reported functioning in youth with SoP changes with age in social, academic, and home/family domains. Baseline anxiety impairment data from 488 treatment-seeking anxiety-disordered youth (ages 7-17, N = 400 with a SoP diagnosis) and their parents were gathered using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale and were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. According to youth with SoP and their parents, overall difficulties, social difficulties, and academic difficulties increased with age, even when controlling for SoP severity. These effects significantly differed for youth with anxiety disorders other than SoP. Adolescents may avoid social situations as parental involvement in their social lives decreases, and their withdrawn behavior may result in increasing difficulty in the social domain. Their avoidance of class participation and oral presentations may increasingly impact their academic performance as school becomes more demanding. Implications are discussed for the early detection and intervention of SoP to prevent increased impairment over the course of development."

This article aims to address the treatment gap for child mental disorders through synthesising three bodies of evidence: the global evidence base on the treatment of these priority disorders; the barriers to implementation of this knowledge; and the innovative approaches taken to address these barriers and improve access to care. Our focus is on low-resource settings, which are mostly found in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Despite the evidence base on the burden of child mental disorders and their long-term consequences, and the recent mental health Gap Action Programme guidelines which testify to the effectiveness of a range of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for these disorders, the vast majority of children in LMIC do not have access to these interventions. We identify three major barriers for the implementation of efficacious treatments: the lack of evidence on delivery of the treatments, the low levels of detection of child mental disorders and the shortage of skilled child mental health professionals. The evidence based on implementation, although weak, supports the use of screening measures for detection of probable disorders, coupled with a second-stage diagnostic assessment and the use of non-specialist workers in community and school settings for the delivery of psychosocial interventions. The most viable strategy to address the treatment gap is through the empowerment of existing human resources who are most intimately concerned with child care, including parents, through innovative technologies, such as mobile health, with the necessary skills for the detection and treatment of child mental disorders."

Statistical analysis was done in STATA and percentage of participants with adequate MHL in various domains was calculated, and difference between various groups was examined using chi-square test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 491 adolescents participated (response rate of 87.2%) of whom a 50.3% were girls and 57.8% were 15 to 17 years of age. Only 50 (10.2%) participants identified depression vignette as that of depression and 51 (10.4%) identified vignette of anxiety disorder as the same. No statistically significant gender differential in MHL was seen (p value = .8). The stigmatizing attitude, assessed by asking a series of questions suggesting stigma toward the particular illness, was observed among almost all participants (depression -99.4%, and anxiety disorders -96.1%). 18.3% and 18.7% of participants reported correct knowledge about the prevention of depression and anxiety respectively. Four hundred and twenty-two (86%) identified the need to seek help for symptoms reported in vignettes. Of these, 234 (55%) preferred parents, and 62 (14.7%) look after friends for any help.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Adolescents residing in Delhi reported poor MHL for Common Mental Disorders. High stigma and poor help-seeking behavior was also observed among the participants toward CMDs."

            "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are the most common class of psychopathology among youth, yet many of these youngsters do not receive treatment. This is particularly concerning given the chronic course of anxiety disorders, which often lead to mood disorders, substance abuse, and serious impairment. Schools are an optimal venue for identifying anxious students and delivering mental health treatment given access to youth and ability to overcome various barriers to treatment. This article reviews four school-based treatments for anxiety disorders that have been evaluated in controlled trials. Discussion centers on feasibility, challenges to school-based implementation, and future research directions for this critical area."

We searched Cochrane, MEDLINE, ProQuest, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL (English), CNKI and SINOMED (Chinese) and CiNii (Japanese) for studies published between January 2000 and May 2022. Following a pre-specified protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42020206424), conditional linear growth curve models and ANOVA analyses were conducted. The search identified 77,891 papers, with a final sample of 234: 206 English, 24 Chinese, and 4 Japanese-language papers. PTSS rates improved for all ages (p = .018, eta2 = 0.035). In contrast, depression and anxiety prevalence remained elevated for years following exposure (p = .424, eta2 = 0.019 and p = .051, eta2 = 0.064, respectively), with significantly higher rates for children and adolescents (p < .005, eta2 > 0.056). Earthquakes and pandemics were associated with higher prevalence of PTSS (p < .019, eta2 > 0.019). Multi-level risk and protective factors were identified.

Perceived psychosocial treatment need was assessed using a single item. The prevalence of psychosocial distress did not differ between SPCa and FPCa survivors (cancer-specific distress: 16.2 vs. 16.7 %; depression: 5.8 vs. 6.4 %; anxiety: 6.6 vs. 5.8 %; ps ≥ .397). Similarly, psychosocial treatment need did not differ between SPCa (11.8 %) and FPCa (13.1 %) cases (p = .303). However, family history moderated the effect of cancer-specific distress on treatment need (OR 2.67, 95 % CI 1.43-4.96, p = .002).

The number of symptom areas was highly predictive of service use, showing a dose-response relationship for all services. Children scoring on ≥4 problem areas had a more than hundredfold risk of being in contact with CAMH services compared to children without problems. The mean number of problem areas for children in CAMH and SPS was 6.1 and 4.4 respectively, strongly supporting the ESSENCE model predicting multisymptomatology in children in specialized services.

Here, we describe our process of conducting school-based youth mental health work in Kenya over the last several years. We focus on five key lessons we learned that could guide future global mental health work with youth: (a) reducing stigma with strengths-focused interventions, (b) expanding access by working in schools, (c) generating buy-in from local stakeholders, (d) adapting the intervention via multicultural collaboration, and (e) applying insights from low- and middle-income countries to serve young people in high-income countries.

Although brief and intensive treatments are evidence-based interventions (Davis III et al. Annual Review of Clinical Psychology, 15, 233-256, 2019), up to one-third of youth do not show significant change in their symptoms following these interventions. Hence, consideration of additional factors influencing treatment response is necessary. Child-factors such as temperament and parent-factors such as parenting behaviors both contribute to the development of specific phobias and their maintenance over time. Specifically, we addressed child temperament (negative affectivity) and parenting behaviors (overprotection) that could uniquely predict clinical outcomes for specific phobias and that might interact to inform goodness-of-fit in the context of these interventions. We also considered whether child- and/or parent-gender shaped the effects of temperament or parenting on clinical outcomes. Participants were 125 treatment-seeking youth (M age = 8.80 years; age range = 6-15 years; 51.5% girls) who met criteria for specific phobia and their mothers and fathers. Mothers' reports of children's negative affectivity uniquely predicted poorer specific phobia symptom severity and global clinical adjustment at post-treatment. Interaction effects were supported between parental overprotection and child negative affectivity for post-treatment fearfulness. The direction of these effects differed between fathers and mothers, suggesting that goodness-of-fit is important to consider, and that parent gender may provide additional nuance to considerations of parent-child fit indices."

Both ADHD groups had significantly less education, were less likely to have graduated from college, and were more likely to have received special educational placement in high school. Both groups also presented with a greater likelihood of dysthymia, alcohol dependence/abuse, cannabis dependence/abuse, and learning disorders, as well as greater psychological distress on all scales of the SCL-90-R than the control group. Both ADHD groups were more likely to have received psychiatric medication and other mental health services than control adults.

Couples (N = 219) participated 6, 13, and 20 months postloss. Use of multilevel regression analyses enabled assessment of the impact of several predictors and facilitated analysis of factors that were either shared by parents or individual. Grief was predicted mainly by shared parent factors: child's age, cause and unexpectedness of death, and number of remaining children. By contrast, depression was predicted by individual parent factors: gender, religious affiliation, and professional help seeking. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed."

Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and odds ratios (aORs) were calculated to determine associations between physician-diagnosed mental disorders in childhood or adolescence and a range of adverse early adulthood (ages 18 to 35) outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Diagnoses of mood/anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance use disorder, conduct disorder, psychotic disorder, personality disorders in childhood or adolescence were associated with having the same diagnoses in adulthood. These mental disorder diagnoses in childhood/adolescence were strongly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviors and adverse adult social outcomes in adulthood. Similarly, suicide attempts in adolescence conferred an increased risk in adulthood of suicide death (aHR: 3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9-6.9), suicide attempts (aHR: 6.2; CI: 5.0-7.6), social housing use (aHR: 1.7; CI 1.4-2.1), income assistance (aHR: 1.8; CI 1.6-2.1), criminal accusation (aHR: 2.2; CI 2.0-2.5), criminal victimization (aHR:2.5; CI 2.2-2.7), and not completing high school (aOR: 3.1; CI: 2.5-3.9).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Mental disorders diagnosed in childhood and adolescence are important risk factors not only for mental disorders in adulthood but also for a range of early adult adversity.

            "abstract": "Background: The Multicenter Youth Flexible ACT Study is an ongoing observational prospective cohort study that examines the effects of Youth Flexible ACT (Assertive Community Treatment) on young people with complex care needs who are difficult to engage in traditional (office-based) mental health services. However, a clear and detailed description of this patient group is lacking. In the current paper, we present baseline characteristics and psychosocial outcomes of the Youth Flexible ACT target group and explore the existence of underlying specific patient subgroups. Methods: Sixteen Youth Flexible ACT teams from seven mental healthcare institutes in the Netherlands participated in the study. Research participants were monitored for 18 months and administered questionnaires measuring psychiatric- and social functioning every 6 months, yielding four measurements. Baseline data were obtained from 199 adolescents, their mental health workers, and parents/carers. Latent Class Analysis based on HoNOSCA scores (measuring psychosocial and daily functioning) was conducted to identify underlying subgroups. Results: The target group of Youth Flexible ACT mainly consisted of patients older than 15 years of age with a history of (specialized) mental healthcare. They face many complex problems, including trauma; developmental, mood, and anxiety disorders; and problems with school attendance, family life, and peer relationships. Other frequently reported difficulties were substance misuse, the involvement of the legal system or police, problems with intellectual functioning, and personal finance. Patients were classified into four distinct classes: the \"internalizing,\" \"externalizing,\" \"non-specific,\" and the \"overly impulsive\" subgroup. Each subgroup had its unique pattern of difficulties and focus, respectively, high levels of depression and anxiety, disruptive behavior, unspecific difficulties, and substance misuse. Conclusions: As expected, patients in Youth Flexible ACT experienced many severe problems, rendering them vulnerable to fragmented and, thus, ineffective care. Our findings underscore the need for an integrated care approach with a multidisciplinary team of skilled professionals that can bridge these wide-ranging psychosocial problems, as each class of participants experienced a different set of difficulties. Youth Flexible ACT teams need to adjust their care services accordingly."

Most people who experience such events recover from it; however, people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) continue to be severely depressed and anxious for several months or even years following the event. Palestinians are particularly at a higher risk for developing anxiety disorders and PTSD due to the continuous exposure to political violence, prolonged displacement, and other limitation on professional, educational, financial opportunities, and mental health services.

Method: Eighty problem gamblers (20% female) were examined using a standardized interview (PG: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [4th ed.; DSM-IV] criteria, Gambling Attitudes and Beliefs Survey; ADHD: Wender Utah Rating Scale-deutsche Kurzform, Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale; comorbidities: Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview). Results: Forty-three percentage of patients screened positive for childhood ADHD, and in 11%, ADHD persisted in adulthood. Patients with adult ADHD had more severe gambling problems (p = .009, d = 1.03) and a higher number of psychiatric comorbidities (p < .001, d = 1.62) compared with those without ADHD. Substance abuse/dependence constituted a predictor for having a history of ADHD (odds ratio [OR] = 4.07, p = .025). Conclusion: ADHD-PG comorbidity is linked to factors that worsen the prognosis.

Watson's (1991) tripartite model groups the symptoms of depression and anxiety into 3 components: nonspecific symptoms of general distress, which do not distinguish depression and anxiety; physiologic arousal, which is relatively unique to anxiety; and anhedonia (or low positive affect), which is unique to depression. Structural equation modeling was used to test this model with self-report data from 3 different samples: outpatients seeking treatment for mood disorder, anxiety disorder, or both (n = 483) outpatients seeking treatment for substance abuse (n = 453), and college students (n = 516). The tripartite model did not fit any of the sample covariance matrices, because the nonspecific symptoms of depression and anxiety could not be adequately represented by a single General Distress factor. An alternative model, in which the Anhedonia and Nonspecific Depression factors loaded on a second-order Depression factor, while the Somatic Arousal and Nonspecific Anxiety factors loaded on a second-order Anxiety factor, produced an excellent fit in all the groups. The Nonspecific Depression and Nonspecific Anxiety factors were the most valid and specific indicators of depression and anxiety, respectively.

The present study utilized assessment information from treatment seeking youth with histories of sexual abuse to explore specific risk indicators for revictimization-risk taking, social problems, maladaptive cognitions, and posttraumatic stress-that may be indicated by self-reported distress. The relationship between initial levels of distress and change in symptoms over a 12-week course of treatment was also explored. Participants were 101 youth referred to a child-focused therapeutic group for victims of sexual abuse, 65 youth referred to an adolescent-focused group, and their non-offending caregivers. Results revealed that when combined into a distress score, depression and anxiety were associated with delinquent behaviors, interpersonal difficulties, maladaptive cognitions, and posttraumatic stress symptoms for child and adolescent group participants at presentation to treatment. Children exhibited improvement on measures of interpersonal difficulties, maladaptive cognitions, and self-reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Adolescents exhibited less change over time, with significant improvement on self-reported social problems and PTSD only. Higher psychological distress was associated with less improvement in regard to negative expectations of abuse impact for child group participants. The findings suggest that distress indicates the presence of specific revictimization risk indicators, helping to identify targetable symptoms for intervention. Therefore, screening for psychological distress after discovery of sexual abuse may help detect youth at higher risk for revictimization and guide treatment."

The prevalence is reported to be higher for rural young people and barriers to treatment exist. Current evidence suggests that 40% of young people experiencing depression or anxiety disorders are not completing secondary school. Further evidence shows that over 50% of individuals who experience FEP do not finish secondary school. Current mental health promotion strategies employed in secondary schools have not been shown to reduce rates of depression or anxiety in adolescence nor identify prodromal or acute FEP. These strategies have not led to interventions that assist young people with mental ill health to finish school.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Not completing secondary school can limit employment options, lead to severe levels of disadvantage and increased burden on welfare and healthcare systems. All young people, including those in rural areas, have the right to education and should not be disadvantaged in their educational aspirations because they have an emerging or current mental illness."

            "abstract": "This study tested a hypothesized model of the relationship between maternal depression and child psychological and physical dysfunction mediated by parenting and medication adherence. A sample of 242 children with asthma, aged 7 to 17, participated with their mothers. Maternal depression was assessed by self-report, and parenting was observed during family interaction tasks. Internalizing symptoms were assessed by self- and clinician reports. Asthma disease activity was assessed according to National Heart Lung and Blood Institute guidelines, and medication adherence was evaluated with a 24-hr recall method. Structural equation modeling indicated that negative parenting partially mediated the relationship between maternal depression and child internalizing symptoms. Child internalizing symptoms, in turn, mediated the associations between both maternal depression and negative parenting and asthma disease activity. Medication adherence did not mediate the link from maternal depression to disease activity. Thus, maternal depression was linked to child psychological dysfunction both directly and indirectly via negative parenting but linked to physical dysfunction only indirectly through psychological dysfunction. These findings suggest that diagnosing and treating depression in mothers of children with asthma would enhance child well-being both psychologically and physically."

Until recently there was a tendency for young Australians to fall between the gap of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and Adult Mental Health Services, and this has contributed to low rates of service use for young people. In 2006, the Australian Government sought to redress this gap in service delivery with its establishment of the Australian National Youth Mental Health Foundation, headspace. This paper presents demographic data collected at headspace Gosford over a 5.5-year period.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The data presented indicates that headspace Gosford has been successful in improving early access to mental health treatment for young people on the Central Coast, in particular for young people aged 14-18. Headspace Gosford has attracted young people of both sexes, with a higher proportion of females. The majority of young people access headspace for mental health problems, predominantly depression and anxiety; however, a significant proportion report physical health or alcohol and drug-related reasons. The likelihood of these referral reasons is informed by gender and age."

Yet, among children diagnosed with serious mental health problems, a majority receive no treatment. Improving access to mental health services for children with behavioral and emotional disorders constitutes an important policy concern.\n    \n\n\n          Aims of the study:\n        \n      \n      To study whether living in a state that has implemented a mental health parity law affects a child's use of outpatient mental health services.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We use the National Survey of America's Families (NSAF) 1997 to 2002 to study whether enacting a state parity law increases the probability that a privately insured child receives mental health treatment (N=26,916). Using a differences-in-differences model, we control for detailed information on a child's health and functioning, and compare mental health care use before and after state parity implementation with non-parity states serving as a comparison group.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Regression results indicate that state parity laws do not affect the likelihood of a child receiving outpatient mental health services. Among the subset of children identified with a greater need for mental health care, the effect of parity appears to be somewhat larger in magnitude but remains insignificant.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      State mental health parity policies aim to improve equity in private insurance coverage for mental health care and could provide a mechanism for reducing unmet need among children with mental health care disorders. Yet, our results suggest these policies do little to affect rates of use. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVISION AND UTILIZATION: Parity policies do not appear to represent a sufficient strategy for addressing access to mental health care among children and adolescents.\n    \n\n\n          Implications for health policies:\n        \n      \n      Developing new approaches to encourage the receipt of high value mental health care in youth constitutes a persisting challenge under both public and private insurance arrangements.\n    \n\n\n          Implications for further research:\n        \n      \n      Since other research has shown that state parity laws are helpful in reducing the family financial burden of caring for a mentally ill child and do not drive up total health care costs, these policies serve a vital function. However, given persistent access problems in the child population, research aimed at increasing rates of mental health services use is needed. In addition, future research on parity laws should consider whether, conditional on having a visit, children in parity states are likely to have more visits compared with other children."

            "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that over 60% of adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) experience diabetes-related stigma (DRS). DRS may affect their emotional self-efficacy (ESE), behavior, and self-care while increasing barriers to comply with physical and mental health treatment. We examined differences in ESE, aggressiveness, self-care, and barriers to comply with treatment among 51 T1D youths (aged 12-17 years) with (G1; n = 35) and without (G2; n = 16) any history of DRS enrolled in a depression treatment study. Using a MANOVA followed by individual univariate analyses, we compared groups in continuous variables, and to conduct comparisons in categorical variables, we used Chi-square tests. MANOVA results were significant, F(5, 45) = 3.20, p = .015. G1 reported lower scores than G2 on ESE, perception of the potential therapeutic impact of group sessions, and family support to comply with insulin treatment. G1 caregivers perceived their offspring as more aggressive and affected by barriers to treatment adherence than their counterparts. G1 members showed a higher proportion of cases with body mass index problems, non-compliance with their meal plan, and multiple episodes of hypoglycemia. Compared to G2, a lower percentage of adolescents in G1 met the recommended glycemic control levels. Our findings support the relationship of DRS with a lower ESE, more behavioral problems, difficulties in food-related self-care, and more barriers to comply with the treatment of diabetes and emotional problems in adolescents. They suggest the need for large-scale education to prevent DRS and psychosocial interventions to combat its impact in adolescents."

To meet the demand for treatment for adolescent depression, there is a need for evidence-based interventions suitable for delivery outside of specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Interpersonal Counselling for Adolescents (IPC-A) is a brief manualised intervention for adolescent depression suitable for delivery by staff who are not qualified health professionals following participation in a brief training course. While initial piloting within Local Authority services has generated promising results, the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of IPC-A has yet to be established.

We also compared predictors between children, adolescents, adults, and older adults (ie, ≥55 years). A persistent course was primarily predicted by clinical and psychological characteristics, including having panic attacks, co-occurring personality disorders, treatment seeking, poor clinical status after treatment, higher severity and longer duration of avoidance behaviour, low extraversion, higher anxiety sensitivity, and higher behavioural inhibition. Unlike disorder onset, sociodemographic characteristics did not predict persistence. Our results outline a profile of patients with specific clinical and psychological characteristics who are particularly vulnerable to anxiety disorder persistence.

Comorbidity is associated with greater impairment, more treatment seeking, and worse outcome among persons with GAD compared with pure GAD. Likewise, patients with panic disorder and MDD who have coexisting GAD tend to have more severe symptoms and less favorable outcome. The relationship between GAD and MDD seems especially close, and data from twin studies suggest that these conditions share a genetic diathesis. Patients with GAD and coexisting conditions respond less well to psychological and pharmacologic treatment, but, for those who do respond, treatment for the primary disorder often also produces improvement in comorbid conditions.

It is based on the global burden of disease research program and on the existence of a large \"treatment gap\" between the need and availability of mental health services, displaying individual and social costs of undiagnosed and untreated mental disorders, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Few academic publications in Brazil dialogue directly with the field of GMH, although several issues drawn from its agenda have been the subject of mental health policies in the country. Brazil can be classified as a middle-income country with a well-structured national health system. This system is oriented toward primary health care, which integrates both community mental health services and the broader health care network. The debate between GMH advocates and critics has unearthed old controversies in psychiatry such as universality or cultural specificity of mental disorders, their expressions, and their relationship with social and economic factors. We intend to examine how these controversies reverberate in the Brazilian mental health scenario, taking as an illustration the debates around Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in the country. ADHD discussions oppose those who argue that the condition is underdiagnosed and undertreated, and those who claim that there is overdiagnosis and overtreatment and thus, medicalization of childhood. This article presents the current status of the Brazilian mental health literature on ADHD, with emphasis on tensions around diagnosis, prevalence and interventions. Our aim is to highlight how the differential in discourse shapes the debate on ADHD in Brazil and how this may contribute to the GMH agenda. This goal will be undertaken in three steps. First, we will briefly examine studies around GMH and ADHD. Secondly, we address Brazilian studies on this theme, considering the specificities regarding the constitution of the mental health field. Finally, we will examine the debate of treatment gap vs. medicalization in the country in order to underscore the potentials and limitations of each perspective."

Trained observers rated tapes of therapy sessions for treatment adherence and child-therapist alliance in a sample of 52 children (aged 8 to 12) with anxiety disorders.

            "abstract": "Although there are efficacious, evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders, youth often experience delays in seeking therapy. Myriad reasons may contribute to this lag in treatment initiation, with some youth possessing concerns about therapy. Treatment concerns are broadly characterized by worries/ambivalence about seeking treatment, including concerns about the negative reactions, consequences, and inconvenience of treatment. As no studies exist for youth with anxiety disorders, this study examined the phenomenology of treatment concerns in 119 treatment-seeking, anxious youth and utilized a structural equation model to examine the relationship between child anxiety, depressive symptoms, treatment concerns, and anxiety-related functional impairment. Over 90 % of the children positively endorsed some type of treatment-related fear, with the most frequently expressed concern being that therapy would take too much time (50.4 %). Based on the model, both child anxiety and depressive symptoms predicted functional impairment, and treatment concerns mediated the relationship between child anxiety and functional impairment."

Participants were asked to review 11 vignettes, which described primary care management of child/youth mental health problems, and rate them on an integer-based ordinal scale for the overall amount of work involved compared to a 12th reference vignette describing an uncomplicated case of ADHD. Respondents were also asked to indicate factors (time, effort, stress) accounting for their ratings. Vignettes presented combinations of three diagnoses (ADHD, anxiety, and depression) and three factors (medical co-morbidity, psychiatric co-morbidity, and difficult families) reported to complicate mental health care. The reference case was pre-assigned a work value of 2. Estimates of the relationship of diagnosis and complicating factors with workload were obtained using linear regression, with random effects at the respondent level.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The 58 pediatricians gave 593 vignette responses.

Although all three complicating factors increased work ratings compared with the reference case, family complexity and psychiatric co-morbidity did so the most (.87 and 1.07 units, respectively, P < .001) while medical co-morbidity increased it the least (.44 units, p < .001). Factors most strongly associated with increased overall work were physician time, physician mental effort, and stress; those least strongly associated were staff time, physician physical effort, and malpractice risk.

CAMHS transitions are often poorly managed with negative outcomes for young people. Better preparation may improve outcomes and experience. This study aimed to co-produce, with young people who had transitioned or were facing transition from CAMHS, a CAMHS Transition Preparation Programme (TPP), deliverable in routine NHS settings.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Eighteen young people, aged 17-22, from three UK National Health Service (NHS) mental health foundation trusts participated in creative, participatory research workshops.

Participants outlined transition procedures and drafted a range of preparation activities, centred around dedicated Transition Peer Support and a transition booklet, which should be offered to all CAMHS leavers, irrespective of discharge or transfer to an adult service. Preparation should aim to build confidence to help young people take responsibility for themselves and flourish in the adult world: coping or getting through it was not enough. Some clinicians also felt anxious at transition and recognised the potential impact on young people of poor communication and lack of understanding between services. Parents would appreciate help to support their offspring during the transition period. Clinicians cited lack of funding and inflexible NHS procedures and policies as potential barriers to the implementation of young people's ideas.

Methylphenidate (MPH) is one of the most commonly used pharmacological treatments for ADHD. The osmotic-release oral system (OROS) formulation of MPH is an extended-release pharmaceutical form that delivers MPH in a controlled manner over a 12-h period, allowing management of symptoms for a full day. OROS-MPH has many advantages over immediate-release MPH, such as avoiding clinical rebound, being easy to take, increasing treatment adherence and reducing the risk of abuse. OROS-MPH has been approved in the USA and Europe for the treatment of ADHD in children, but it has only been approved for the treatment of adults in the USA and Canada. This review summarizes evidence from various clinical studies assessing the efficacy and safety of OROS-MPH in different clinical samples of adults with ADHD, including samples with the most common comorbidities found in ADHD patients. The studies are classified according to their design characteristics as randomized, controlled trials or open trials. Data on dosing, treatment adherence and other clinical parameters relevant for the use of OROS-MPH in adults with ADHD are also reported and discussed."

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been established as the gold-standard treatment for anxiety disorders among typically developing youth and adults, and demonstrates similar efficacy among youth with high-functioning autism (HFA). Many CBT interventions utilize a \"full-package\" treatment approach to treat co-occurring anxiety in youth with ASD. However, these service delivery systems are often therapist-intensive, costly, and impractical, thereby compromising full engagement and treatment adherence. This paper describes the design, rationale, and methodology of a study examining stepped-care CBT for youth with HFA and co-occurring anxiety - a clinical trial examining the efficacy of low-intensity, parent-led CBT as the first line of treatment and utilizing a more intensive, therapist-led intervention for nonresponders. The study will evaluate the potential benefits of stepped-care and parent-led therapist-assisted interventions, predictors of treatment response, and the economic value of using a stepped-care model.

Like Canada, the Australia has a federal system of Government with 5 States and two territories. Each State and territory has its own legislation on mental health. The federal (Commonwealth) Government is responsible for health care planning. In addition, the federal Government subsidizes an insurance program (Medicare) that covers visits to specialists and family physicians, while provincial governments are involved in the provision of hospital care and community mental health services. The Commonwealth government also subsidises the cost of medication through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. These funds are supplemented by private health insurance. Mental health costs account for 6.5 per cent of all health care costs. Primary care treats the majority of common psychological disorders such as anxiety or depression, while specialist mental health services concentrate on those with severe mental illness. There have been 4 national mental health plans since 1992 with the long term aims of promoting mental health, increasing the quality and responsiveness of services, and creating a consistent approach to mental health service system reform among Australian states and territories. These systematic cycles of planning have first allowed a shift from psychiatric hospitals to community services, from reliance on psychiatric hospitals as pivotal to psychiatric care system. Community care budgets have increased, but overall have decreased with money not following patients; but recent deployment of federally funded through Medicare access to psychotherapy by psychologists for common mental disorders in primary care have increased overall budget. Concerns remain that shift to youth first onset psychosis clinics may come from older long-term psychotic patients, a form of discrimination whilst evidence amount of excess mortality by cardio-vascular diseases and cancers, and due to poverty, poor health prevention and primary health care for these patients. From a system perspective, Australia has been inspired by Canada and created in 2012 its own mental health commission with a similar leading role for patients and families, aboriginal people representatives, but also a surveillance of the system with its own yearly report, like the Quebec Health Commissioner 2012 mental health system performance report."

The experiment sequence in each run consisted of three phases, which included the Adaptation phase (1 min) after oxygen administration, the Control phase (2 min) that maintained a stable condition before the task, and the Task phase (2 min) that performed 2-back task. SpO(2) and HR were measured during each phase. The analysis of cognitive performance with 92% oxygen administration when compared to 21% oxygen revealed that the response time decreased. When 92% oxygen in the air was supplied, the blood oxygen saturation increased while the heart rate decreased compared to those under the 21% oxygen condition. The response time also decreased for the subjects with a high SpO(2) during the Task phase. This showed that due to sufficient oxygen supply necessary for cognitive processing, SpO(2) increased and heart rate decreased. Therefore, an increase in cognitive ability such as a decrease in response time was observed in a transient period for ADHD children."

However, little is known about the association between PLEs and PIU among adolescents. The present study examined the associations between PLEs and PIU and negative life events among adolescents. Methods: In total, 1,678 adolescents attending high school were recruited for a cross-sectional survey. They completed self-reported assessments of PLEs using the Prodromal Questionnaire-16 (PQ-16) and measures of depression, anxiety, self-esteem, internet use, and negative life events using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), the Korean Scale for Internet Addiction (K-scale), and the Lifetime Incidence of Traumatic Events for Children (LITE-C), including cybersexual harassment and school violence. Results: A total of 1,239 subjects (73.8%) scored at least 1 on the PQ-16. The mean total and distress PQ-16 scores were significantly higher in students who used mental health services. The total and distress prodromal questionnaire-16 (PQ-16) scores were positively correlated with the CES-D, STAI-S, STAI-T, LITE-C, and K-scale scores but negatively correlated with the RSES score. Hierarchical linear regression analysis revealed that PLEs were significantly associated with a high K-scale score and the incidence of negative life events, such as LITE-C, cybersexual harassment, and bully-victims. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that PIU and negative life experiences were significantly associated with PLEs in adolescents. Assessment and therapeutic intervention with regard to internet use as a coping strategy for stress are needed to prevent the development of clinical psychotic symptoms."

The effectiveness of current pharmacologic treatments is often reduced, due to low treatment adherence and medication discontinuation. This current systematic literature review analyzes the current state of knowledge surrounding ADHD medication discontinuation, focusing on: 1) the extent of patient persistence; 2) adherence; and 3) the underlying reasons for patients' treatment discontinuation and how discontinuation rates and reasons vary across patient subgroups. We selected 91 original studies (67 with persistence/discontinuation results, 26 with adherence results, and 41 with reasons for discontinuation, switching, or nonadherence) and 36 expert opinion reviews on ADHD medication discontinuation, published from 1990 to 2013. Treatment persistence on stimulants, measured by treatment duration during the 12-month follow-up periods, averaged 136 days for children and adolescents and 230 days for adults. Owing to substantial study heterogeneity, comparisons across age or medication type subgroups were generally inconclusive; however, long-acting formulations and amphetamines were associated with longer treatment duration than short-acting formulations and methylphenidates. The medication possession ratio, used to measure adherence, was <0.7 for all age groups and medication classes during a 12-month period. Adverse effects were the most commonly cited reason for discontinuation in all studies. Original research studies reported the lack of symptom control as a common discontinuation reason, followed by dosing inconvenience, social stigma associated with ADHD medication, and the patient's attitude. In summary, although there was a lack of consistency in the measurement of adherence and persistence, these findings indicate that drug adherence and persistence are generally poor among patients with ADHD. Clinicians may be able to help improve adherence and persistence to ADHD treatment by educating caregivers and patients on treatment goals, administering long-acting medications, and following-up with patients to verify if medication is still effective and well-tolerated."

More recently, there is growing recognition that Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) may persist into adulthood requiring services beyond age 18. However, despite National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Guidance which recommends specialist services for adults with ADHD, there is currently a lack of such services in the UK. The aim of the current study is to explore the experiences of young people with ADHD during transition from CAMHS to AMHS.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Semi-structured qualitative interviews with ADHD patients accessing CAMHS clinics in Nottinghamshire were analysed using thematic analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Ten semi-structured interviews were transcribed and analysed.

Nature and severity of problems are perceived to impede or facilitate transition, with predominantly more 'complex presentations' with associated mental health problems more familiar to AMHS (e.g. self-harm, depression) making for smoother transitions to adult services. Transitions to AMHS were more difficult when ADHD was viewed as the main or sole clinical problem.

Beiser, principal investigator) to examine more closely the relationship between self-reported depressive symptoms and parent/teacher reported conduct symptoms. Such a relationship has been consistently found in a number of studies. Children aged 7 to 10 were found to show more academic and social problems when rated as having high conduct symptoms. Children in the co-morbid group were found to have the highest rates of family stress and help-seeking behavior. Suicidal ideation was as high in the conduct and co-morbid groups as it was in the high depression group. More First Nations children were found in the high conduct-low depression group. The significance of these findings is discussed."

            "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      Children of parents with a mental illness and/or addiction are at high risk for developing a mental illness themselves. Parental mental illness is highly prevalent leading to a serious number of children at high risk. The aim of this review is to give an up-to-date overview of psychopathology in children of parents with various mental illnesses and/or addiction, based on recent literature.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Worldwide, 15-23% of children live with a parent with a mental illness. These children have up to 50% chance of developing a mental illness. Parental anxiety disorder sets children at a more specific risk for developing anxiety disorder themselves, where children of parents with other mental illnesses are at high risk of a large variety of mental illnesses. Although preventive interventions in children of mentally ill parents may decrease the risk of problem development by 40%; currently, these children are not automatically identified and offered help.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      This knowledge should encourage mental health services to address the needs of these children which requires strong collaboration between Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and Adult Mental Health Services. Directions for further research would be to include both parents, allow for comorbidity and to look deeper into a broader variety of mental illnesses such as autism and personality disorder other than borderline."

Countries were categorized as having high versus low mental health resources. The sample comprised 4,894 schoolchildren in seven countries.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Across Europe, only 25.6% of children with a mental disorder had received mental health services in the previous 12 months, including 31.5% in high-resources countries and 18.9% in low-resources countries (p=.001) (N=4,867). The presence of any mental disorder, maternal psychological distress, gender, living in a single-parent home, and low academic performance were determinants of service use. The effect of resources group on the likelihood of receiving services remained significant when the analyses controlled for all predictors (odds ratio=1.41, p<.01). Determinants differed between groups-maternal psychological distress was associated with service use in high-resources countries, and gender was associated with service use in low-resources countries.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The findings point to a substantial portion of unmet need across Europe and to major differences in access to care in low- versus high-resources countries.

Experiences of loss during the prior 12 months were associated with both forms of affective disorder, while poor family relationships were specific correlates of dysthymia. In contrast, peer relationships and pathological behaviors did not differ between depressed subjects and controls. Although psychosocial functioning was significantly impaired in both groups of depressed adolescents, treatment seeking was limited to 34.7% for major depressive subjects and 23.8% for dysthymic subjects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The results provide evidence that major depression and dysthymia in adolescence are equally severe but may have distinct patterns in associated factors.

Recent research indicates that adults with ADHD experience more severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms than those without ADHD. However, little is known about nicotine withdrawal in adolescent smokers with history of ADHD. Among a sample of 134 nicotine-dependent adolescents entering a smoking cessation research study, participants completed the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS) and lifetime diagnostic assessment for ADHD during the baseline visit. Responses on individual items and MNWS total score were compared between participants with and without history of ADHD. In addition, correlations between MNWS responses and current ADHD symptoms were investigated among participants with history of ADHD. Forty-eight participants (36%) met lifetime ADHD criteria. Adolescent smokers with history of ADHD scored significantly higher on MNWS than those without history of ADHD. Among participants with history of ADHD, responses on the MNWS difficulty concentrating, restlessness/impatience, and anxiety/nervousness items each correlated positively with several current ADHD symptoms. Treatment-seeking adolescent smokers with history of ADHD are more likely to endorse nicotine withdrawal symptoms than those without history of ADHD. However, it does not appear that the symptoms reported in this sample represent a valid \"withdrawal syndrome,\" particularly because these smokers had not yet formally attempted to quit. Rather, the data likely reflect common features between ADHD and nicotine withdrawal. Smoking research, particularly among adolescents in whom ADHD is so common, should carefully consider the complex issue of comorbid ADHD and nicotine dependence."

The sample was divided into thirds, with 37 who had a previous diagnosis of depression, 33 who had self-perceived emotional distress, and 35 controls. The participants were interviewed in depth about their reasons for avoiding professional mental health care services, and the interview results were analyzed using both qualitative and cultural domain techniques and corroborated through comparison with the results of three focus groups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participants' reasons for avoidance varied both by gender and according to prior experience with health services. Male study participants and female controls mainly understood depressive symptoms as normal and therefore not requiring treatment. Female participants with self-perceived distress were more likely to cite problems of access to treatment and fear of speaking to an unknown person about their problems. Females with a diagnosis expressed lack of trust in the benefits of treatment and fear of the social consequences of help-seeking. In their recommendations for best practices, the study participants suggested educational initiatives, as well as changes in the organization of mental health care services.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A better understanding of the views of young people and a greater effort to involve them as active participants is important for facilitating help-seeking in this age group, and for adapting mental health care services to adolescent users and their social context."

The Family Symptom Inventory was used to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety in pediatric patients with cancer and their caregivers. Separate hierarchical linear regression models examined the relationship between demographic variables, cancer characteristics, socioeconomic status, and access to care and patient or caregiver depression/anxiety. Participants included 196 pediatric patients with cancer (mean age, 11.21 y; 49% African American) and their caregivers. On average, caregivers reported low levels of depression/anxiety. Symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients were correlated with poorer mental health in caregivers (r=0.62; P<0.01). Self-reported financial difficulty (β=0.49; P<0.001) and brain cancer diagnosis for their child (β=0.42; P=0.008) were significantly associated with depression and anxiety in caregivers. Analysis did not reveal significant associations between race, household income, or access to care and patient or caregiver depression/anxiety. Perception of financial hardship can adversely impact mental health in caregivers of children with cancer. Psychosocial assessment and interventions may be especially important for caregivers of patients with brain tumors and caregivers who report feeling financial difficulty."

            "abstract": "Research into the causes and outcomes of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been extensive, yet little is known about the perception of ADHD as a disorder and its related outcomes among diagnosed youth. The present study applied the Common-Sense Model of Illness Representations (CSM) to examine the perception of ADHD and its association with quality of life (QoL), coping strategies, and treatment adherence among 63 diagnosed adolescents (10-18 years). Adolescents recruited from clinics, parent support groups, and an educational service completed self-report measures of the key constructs. Results indicated that adolescents generally perceive their ADHD as mildly threatening; four illness beliefs (perceived impact, personal control, timeline, and coherence) are significant predictors of coping and four (perceived impact, causes, personal control, and treatment control) are that of QoL. Adolescents who perceived minimal impact, expected longer duration, had strong sense of coherence, and believed in personal control of ADHD coped with the disorder more actively. Those who made weaker attribution to psychological and environmental causes, believed in personal control and the effectiveness of behavioral treatment enjoyed better QoL. In addition, female adolescents seem to experience more difficulties in the management of ADHD than male counterparts. These findings have potentially important clinical implications, suggesting that perceptions of ADHD related to the disorder's impact, duration, coherence, and personal control, may be important for clinicians to address when caring for adolescents with the disorder."

This Chilean survey is the first national representative survey in the Latin American region to examine the prevalence of diagnostic and statistical manual-IV (DSM-IV) psychiatric disorders in the region in children and adolescents.\n## METHODS\n Subjects aged 4-18 were selected using a stratified multistage design. The diagnostic interview schedule for children version IV (DISC-IV) was used to obtain 12-month DSM-IV diagnoses of affective, anxiety, conduct and substance use disorders, and supplemented with questionnaires examining family risk factors, family income, and service utilization. The parent or the primary caretaker was interviewed for children, aged 4-11, using the DISC-IV; however, adolescents, aged 12-18, were directly interviewed.\n## RESULTS\nA sample of 1558 children and adolescents was evaluated. Using the most stringent DISC-IV impairment algorithm, the prevalence rate for any psychiatric disorders was 22.5% (19.3% for boys and 25.8% for girls). The prevalence rate was higher among the children, aged 4-11, in comparison with adolescents, aged 12-18 (27.8% and 16.5%, respectively). Less than half of the subjects in need of services sought some form of assistance. Nearly a quarter of those using services did not present with a psychiatric diagnosis in the past year. Comorbidity was found in 24.8% of those with a disorder, but only 6.3% had three or more diagnoses.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe prevalence of psychiatric disorders in Chile is high among children and adolescents. This study highlights the increasing need to reevaluate mental health services provided to children and adolescents in Latin America.\n"

However, these studies have failed to distinguish between transgender people who identify within the gender binary and those who identify as non-binary. Aims : This study aimed to compare levels of mental health symptomatology (anxiety, depression, and non-suicidal self-injury behavior) and social support of treatment seeking non-binary transgender young individuals with those self-identified as binary transgender young individuals. All participants attended a national transgender health service in the UK during a 2-year period. Measures : Age and gender identity descriptors were collected, as well as clinical measures of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), self-esteem (The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), non-suicidal self-injury (Non-Suicidal Self-Injury: Treatment Related), and social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support). Results : A total of 388 young people, aged 16-25 years, agreed participation; 331 (85.3%) identified as binary and 57 (14.7%) as non-binary. Analysis of the data showed the non-binary group experienced significantly more anxiety and depression and had significantly lower self-esteem than the binary group. There were no significant differences between groups in the likelihood of engaging in non-suicidal self-injury behavior or levels of social support. Conclusions : Non-binary identifying treatment seeking transgender youth are at increased risk of developing anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem compared to binary transgender youth. This may reflect the even greater barriers and feelings of discrimination that may be faced by those whose identity does not fit the notion of binary gender that is pervasive in how society views both cis- and transgender populations."

The most common comorbid pattern was that of depressive and anxiety disorders. Among adolescents with anxiety and depression, 72% and 62% of those in the community and clinical settings, respectively, reported the occurrence of anxiety before that of depression. Depressed adolescents with comorbid disorders used significantly more mental health services than adolescents with depression only.

Among these, there were 64 autistic girls and 125 autistic boys. We wanted to know more about differences in problems between autistic and typical developing adolescents in crisis, both to prevent crisis and to improve services. The percentage of adolescents with autism increased over the years studied. Autistic adolescents experienced more severe impairment in functioning compared to typically developing adolescents. Compared to other adolescents, both boys and girls on the autism spectrum were diagnosed less frequently with mood disorders, behavioral disorders, relational problems, and abuse. Autistic girls had a higher suicide risk and suffered more often from anxiety disorders than autistic boys, while autistic boys had a longer history of problems. Outpatient care for children with autism should include easy access to specialized professionals who aim to reduce anxiety and help young people with autism to cope with the challenges of adolescence.

Left untreated, further clinical distress and impairment in important life domains may arise. Yet, the treatment gap remains large. Prior research has shown that individuals with depressive disorders prefer seeking help from informal sources such as family and friends ahead of formal sources. However, this preference has its disadvantages such as experiencing actual, perceived and internalized stigmatizing responses from them which may delay or deter help-seeking.

In adjusted models, younger birth cohorts (vs. born <1960), greater childhood maltreatment and later AAO of first heroin use were associated with more rapid transitions from heroin use to dependence. Living independently, parental violence, and alcohol dependence were associated with slower transitions. Earlier treatment-seeking was associated with younger birth cohorts, having dependent children and later AOO of dependence.

            "abstract": "Childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a risk factor for the development of substance abuse and substance use disorders (SUD) in adolescence and (early) adulthood. ADHD and SUD also frequently co-occur in treatment-seeking adolescents, which complicates diagnosis and treatment, and is associated with poor treatment outcomes. In this study, we provide a systematic review of controlled studies on the effectiveness of pharmacological, psychosocial, and complementary treatments of ADHD in adolescents with and without comorbid SUD. In addition, we review the longitudinal association between pharmacotherapy for childhood ADHD and the development of SUD in adolescence and early adulthood. We conducted a systematic review of the research literature published since 2000 using Medline, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases to select randomized clinical trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence from each study was rated using the SIGN grading system. Based on the limited evidence available, strong clinical recommendations are not justified, but provisionally, we conclude that stimulant treatment in children with ADHD may prevent the development of SUD in adolescence or young adulthood, that high-dose stimulant treatment could be an effective treatment for adolescents with ADHD and SUD comorbidity, that cognitive behavior therapy might have a small beneficial effect in these patients, and that alternative treatments are probably not effective. More studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions that will allow for strong clinical recommendations."

However, less than half of young people with mental health problems seek professional help and hence innovative approaches to support this group are needed. To this end Coping with Anxiety and Depression shows promise. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the implementation of Coping with Anxiety and Depression for young people aged 15-25 years showing symptoms of anxiety and/or depression in a Danish community setting.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The programme was implemented in 39 Danish municipalities. To evaluate the implementation of the programme, we collected quantitative and qualitative data simultaneously and subsequently we triangulated it in the data analysis. The qualitative data collection comprised semi-structured interviews in seven case municipalities. In each municipality we conducted interviews with a local municipality coordinator of the program, a group interview with two voluntary instructors facilitating the program and a group interview with two to seven participants in the programme. In total, seven local coordinators, 14 voluntary instructors and 23 participants (8 men and 15 women) were interviewed. We also carried out a baseline and post-intervention survey. Interview data was coded via an inductive and deductive analysis approach. Survey data was analysed via descriptive statistics in the statistical software programme STATA 16.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The evaluation showed that the implementation of the programme is feasible, and that most participants (83%) were satisfied with the programme to a high/very high extent. In total, 84% of the participants strongly agreed/agreed that it was advantageous that instructors themselves had experience with anxiety and depression. Qualitative data showed that the participants were very positive about the group format. It also showed that recruitment and retention of participants and especially young instructors were challenging but doable. Thus our findings suggest that the programme can be implemented in a way that is perceived as useful and satisfying to young people.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Coping with Anxiety and Depression constitutes a feasible peer-to-peer, group-based community programme that is well-received by its target group.

Before telehealth, children and families may wait weeks for psychiatric evaluation. Introduction: Increasing numbers of pediatric patients are reporting the need for mental health care when they present to region's rural emergency departments (EDs). Outcomes of telemental health services were evaluated, with a focus on treatment throughput and referral. Materials and Methods: Observational 18-month program evaluation of outcomes for children age <18 years (N = 87) who received physical and mental health assessment by an ED physician. Children who subsequently received a mental health diagnosis were treated by a psychiatrist via telemental health visits (September 2017-May 2019) in 4 rural EDs. Results: The majority of children (ages 5-17) presented with depression- or anxiety-related disorders (49%) or suicidal ideation/attempt or self-harm (46%), with substance abuse accounting for 5% of cases. Mean ED wait times were 29 min [95% CI: 6-52 min] for children admitted to inpatient (IP) care compared with 33 min [95% CI: 22-43 min] for those discharged to outpatient (OP) care. Mean length of stay (LOS) of 8 h 56 min [95% CI: 166-906 min] was observed for children admitted to IP care compared with mean LOS of 6 h 58 min [95% CI: 382-454 min] for those discharged to OP care (p = 0.072). For suicidality cases, children who were subsequently admitted to IP care experienced a significantly longer mean LOS of 12 h 30 min [95% CI: 279-1221 min] compared with a mean LOS of 7 h 13 min [95% CI: 346-520 min; p = 0.015] for children discharged to OP care. Mean total payor reimbursements were significantly lower than actual ED costs (p < 0.001). Discussion: ED wait times and LOS were lengthy overall. Future evaluation of an evidence-based peds mental health triage screening tool is needed to support rural ED providers in peds mental health treatment. Conclusion: Additional resources and strategic policy supports are needed to bridge the mental health care treatment gap for rural children to address critical prevention, screening, and reimbursement needs."

Specifically, the study aims addressed whether African American (n = 44) versus Caucasian (n = 359) children varied on (1) baseline clinical characteristics, (2) treatment process variables, and (3) treatment outcomes. Participants were ages 7-17 and met DSM-IV-TR criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and/or separation anxiety disorder. Baseline data, as well as outcome data at 12 and 24 weeks, were obtained by independent evaluators. Weekly treatment process variables were collected by therapists. Results indicated no racial differences on baseline clinical characteristics. However, African American participants attended fewer psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy sessions, and were rated by therapists as less involved and compliant, in addition to showing lower mastery of CBT. Once these and other demographic factors were accounted for, race was not a significant predictor of response, remission, or relapse. Implications of these findings suggest African American and Caucasian youth are more similar than different with respect to the manifestations of anxiety and differences in outcomes are likely due to treatment barriers to session attendance and therapist engagement."

            "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often considered a childhood disorder. However, in those diagnosed with ADHD as children, inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity can persist into adulthood, causing significant functional impairment and emotional distress, even if the condition no longer meets diagnostic criteria. This review examines the developmental and psychosocial factors to consider in adolescents with ADHD and the strategies that facilitate the transition from pediatric to adult care. Our findings are based on PubMed database searches conducted on November 29, 2011, that identified articles pertaining to ADHD and continuity or transition in medical care for adolescents published in English within the 5-year period preceding this date. Adolescents with ADHD face specific burdens associated with transitioning into adulthood that can impede the achievement of academic and occupational goals. The main finding of the literature review was that ADHD treatment rates decline sharply from childhood through young adulthood, despite the fact that functional impairment often persists. Moreover, although psychosocial therapy can play an important role in resolving functional difficulties and encouraging patient adherence to pharmacotherapy, the existing literature focuses mainly on pharmacotherapy as first-line treatment for ADHD. Therefore, careful, advanced planning to ensure continuity of medical and psychiatric care is essential. This planning involves the pediatric service that has been providing care, the adult service that will assume the responsibility of providing care, the young person with ADHD, and the family. Although recommendations for planning initiatives have been developed by a variety of professional organizations, they do not seem to be routinely implemented for the transition of ADHD care. Such careful advanced transition planning can ensure continuity of treatment, encourage treatment adherence, and help young individuals adjust to new life circumstances and avoid negative educational, social, and vocational results. Guidelines designed to facilitate this transition of care may be helpful."

It is already evident that the direct and indirect psychological and social effects of the COVID‑19 pandemic are insidious and affect the mental health of young children and adolescents now and will in the future. The aim and objectives of this knowledge-synthesis study were to identify the impact of the pandemic on children's and adolescent's mental health and to evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions employed during previous and the current pandemic to promote children's and adolescents' mental health. Methodology: We conducted the systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included experimental randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, observational studies, and qualitative studies. Results: Of the 5828 articles that we retrieved, 18 articles met the inclusion criteria. We thematically analyzed them and put the major findings under the thematic areas of impact of the pandemic on children's and adolescents' mental health. These studies reported that pandemics cause stress, worry, helplessness, and social and risky behavioral problems among children and adolescents (e.g., substance abuse, suicide, relationship problems, academic issues, and absenteeism from work). Interventions such as art-based programs, support services, and clinician-led mental health and psychosocial services effectively decrease mental health issues among children and adolescents. Conclusion: Children and adolescents are more likely to experience high rates of depression and anxiety during and after a pandemic. It is critical that future researchers explore effective mental health strategies that are tailored to the needs of children and adolescents. Explorations of effective channels regarding the development and delivery of evidenced-based, age-appropriate services are vital to lessen the effects and improve long-term capacities for mental health services for children and adolescents. Key Practitioner Message: The COVID-19 pandemic's physical restrictions and social distancing measures have affected each and every domain of life. Although the number of children and adolescents affected by the disease is small, the disease and the containment measures such as social distancing, school closure, and isolation have negatively impacted the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents. The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children and adolescents is of great concern. Anxiety, depression, disturbances in sleep and appetite, as well as impairment in social interactions are the most common presentations. It has been indicated that compared to adults, this pandemic may continue to have increased long term adverse consequences on children's and adolescents' mental health. As the pandemic continues, it is important to monitor the impact on children's and adolescents' mental health status and how to help them to improve their mental health outcomes in the time of the current or future pandemics."

Internationally, one-fifth of children and adolescents have serious mental health problems, yet services catering to them are scarce. Locally, traditional mental health services are associated with much stigma. In 2009, the Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT), a youth-focused outreach and assessment service, was set up to address service gaps and care barriers.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      CHAT's key offering is a free and confidential mental health assessment service to facilitate help-seeking individuals between the ages of 16 and 30 gain access to early treatment.

            "abstract": "Assessing anxiety in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is inherently challenging due to overlapping (e.g., social avoidance) and ambiguous symptoms (e.g., fears of change). An ASD addendum to the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Child/Parent, Parent Version (ADIS/ASA) was developed to provide a systematic approach for differentiating traditional anxiety disorders from symptoms of ASD and more ambiguous, ASD-related anxiety symptoms. Interrater reliability and convergent and discriminant validity were examined in a sample of 69 youth with ASD (8-13 years, 75% male, IQ = 68-143) seeking treatment for anxiety. The parents of participants completed the ADIS/ASA and a battery of behavioral measures. A second rater independently observed and scored recordings of the original interviews. Findings suggest reliable measurement of comorbid (intraclass correlation = 0.85-0.98, κ = 0.67-0.91) as well as ambiguous anxiety-like symptoms (intraclass correlation = 0.87-95, κ = 0.77-0.90) in children with ASD. Convergent and discriminant validity were supported for the traditional anxiety symptoms on the ADIS/ASA, whereas convergent and discriminant validity were partially supported for the ambiguous anxiety-like symptoms. Results provide evidence for the reliability and validity of the ADIS/ASA as a measure of traditional anxiety categories in youth with ASD, with partial support for the validity of the ambiguous anxiety-like categories. Unlike other measures, the ADIS/ASA differentiates comorbid anxiety disorders from overlapping and ambiguous anxiety-like symptoms in ASD, allowing for more precise measurement and clinical conceptualization. Ambiguous anxiety-like symptoms appear phenomenologically distinct from comorbid anxiety disorders and may reflect either symptoms of ASD or a novel variant of anxiety in ASD."

            "abstract": "Major depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders and the number one cause of disability worldwide. Once a person experiences a major depressive episode (MDE), the likelihood of recurrence is very high. The prevention of first onset, as well as the protection against recurrence after recovery, are therefore essential goals for the mental health field. By the end of the 20th century, however, most depression research efforts had focused on either acute or prophylactic treatment. In this article, we review USA and international studies that have attempted to reduce incidence of MDE, either 1) to prevent onset in populations of children and adults (including women during the postpartum period) not currently meeting diagnostic criteria for depression, or 2) to prevent a new episode in individuals who have recovered after treatment through protective, but not prophylactic interventions. We identified twelve randomized controlled trials focused on preventing the onset of major depression (both MDE and postpartum depression (PPD)), five randomized controlled trials focusing on preventing relapse, and no randomized controlled trials focused exclusively on preventing recurrent episodes through protective interventions. The review is limited in scope given that depression prevention trials focused on infants, young children, and older adults were not included in the review. The research to date suggests that the prevention of major depression is a feasible goal for the 21st century. If depression prevention interventions become a standard part of mental health services, unnecessary suffering due to depression will be greatly reduced. This review concludes with suggestions for the future direction of depression prevention research."

Evidence is needed about the effectiveness of interventions for children affected by AIDS in rural areas. This article describes an intervention study aimed at developing, implementing, and evaluating a community-based counseling program for the AIDS orphans of Fuyang, Anhui Province, an area of central China where a tainted blood donation scheme infected countless farmers and left many children orphaned by AIDS. In China these children live in rural settings with no access to mental health services. The authors trained a group of community-based counselors to provide group counseling sessions focusing on self-awareness and communication and to provide a basic therapeutic approach for depression and anxiety. The authors conducted a baseline and two follow-up surveys of 39 children who met the clinical diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression. There was a statistically significant improvement for the children on anxiety, but there was no statistically significant improvement on depression, with greatest gains immediately following the intervention. We demonstrated the feasibility of task shifting for mental health services in this setting."

The researchers assessed the psychological functioning of the children using age appropriate Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) forms, and compared the scores of children with NP status with population-based data. The results indicate that in this rural sample, the prevalence of internalizing and externalizing disorders in children from NP homes was higher than in population-based norms. Specifically, the preschoolers showed a higher rate of depression, and the school-age children had higher rates of anxiety, depression, and atypical behaviors than their population-based peers.

To inform early intervention for adolescents, we investigated the effect of gender and education type on perception of barriers to help seeking, mental health literacy, and the awareness and use of mental health services. Method: A web-based survey using vignettes, open-ended and multiple choice items was administered to upper secondary school students in two counties in Norway. Results: The survey was completed by 1249 students (88% response rate) with an average age of 17.6 years and 56% were female. Compared to males, the females were better in identifying psychological problems of anxiety and trauma, awareness of mental health services (p < 0.001) and perceived more barriers for seeking help (cost and waiting time; p < 0.001). For use of all mental health services, the effect of education type was greater than the effect of gender. Conclusion: For adolescents, gender appears to play a significant, but not exclusive, role in the inclination to seek professional help for mental health problems.

            "abstract": "Adolescents with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience significant impairment in functioning. There are multiple clinic-based interventions that address these impairments (e.g., behavioral parent training). However, clinic-based interventions are often associated with barriers to care (e.g., transportation and financial resources), which can limit access based upon social determinants of health (e.g., parental income). School-based interventions have been developed to address the impairments adolescents with ADHD experience, with the goal of also improving access to care and limiting the impact social determinants of health. Despite this, to date, there has been almost no research evaluating the role of social determinants of health on the efficacy of school-based ADHD interventions. In a sample of 222 adolescents with ADHD randomly assigned to receive two different interventions, the present study evaluates the impact of income, maternal education, single-parent status, and race, on intervention efficacy. Single-parent status had the greatest impact on intervention efficacy, resulting in diminished improvements for two of the three outcomes. There was also a significant moderation effect for income, but only for parent-rated homework performance. In addition, main effects were found for single-parent status and race that represent disparities present at baseline that remained post-intervention. Overall, this study suggests that although school-based models of service delivery have the potential to significantly improve access to care, social determinants of health, and single-parent status, in particular, still need to be considered and addressed."

Among ADNOS presentations resembling GAD, those failing to meet the \"worries more days than not\" or \"worries across multiple domains\" criteria showed lower internalizing symptoms than GAD youth, but comparable anxious/depressed symptoms, somatic symptoms, social problems, externalizing problems, and total problems as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Childhood ADNOS cases are prevalent and warrant clinical attention.

            "abstract": "Despite growing evidence that bipolar disorder often emerges in adolescence, there are limited data regarding treatment patterns of youth with bipolar disorder in community samples. Our objective was to present the prevalence and clinical correlates of treatment utilization for a nationally representative sample of US adolescents with bipolar disorder. Analyses are based on data from the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement, a face-to-face survey of 10,123 adolescents (ages 13-18) identified in household and school settings. We found that of adolescents meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I or II disorder (N = 250), 49 % were treated for depression or mania, 13 % were treated for conditions other than depression or mania, and 38 % did not report receiving treatment. Treatment for depression or mania was associated with increased rates of suicide attempts, as well as greater role disability and more comorbid alcohol use relative to those who had not received treatment. Treated adolescents had triple the rate of ADHD and double the rates of behavior disorders than those without treatment. Our findings demonstrate that a substantial proportion of youth with bipolar disorder do not receive treatment, and of those who do, many receive treatment for comorbid conditions rather than for their mood-related symptoms. Treatment was more common among youth with severe manifestations and consequences of bipolar disorder and those with behavior problems. These trends highlight the need to identify barriers to treatment for adolescents with bipolar disorder and demonstrate that those in treatment are not representative of youth with bipolar disorder in the general population."

Universal mental health screening is a potential strategy to increase problem detection and reduce disparities in care provision. However, no study has experimentally tested the effect of universal screening on patterns of service utilization across racial groups and the potential to reduce disparities. Using a cluster randomized design, we compared service linkage patterns among 7th- and 8th-grade Asian American and Latino students (N = 2,494; Mage = 13.65) in schools that either conducted or did not conduct universal depression screening. Multilevel analyses showed that enrollment in a universal screening school, Latino ethnicity, and low academic performance were associated with greater likelihood of referral. However, these factors were not related to caregiver consent or treatment initiation. Screening-triggered referrals were less likely to result in caregiver consent compared to routine referrals. Furthermore, universal screening did not result in a statistically significant reduction in racial/ethnic disparities in treatment referral. Implications for engaging ethnic minority families beyond the point of problem recognition and referral are discussed."

            "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has become a major aspect of the work of child and adolescent psychiatrists and paediatricians in the UK. In Scotland, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services were required to address an increase in referral rates and changes in evidence-based medicine and guidelines without additional funding. In response to this, clinicians in Dundee have, over the past 15 years, pioneered the use of integrated psychiatric, paediatric, nursing, occupational therapy, dietetic and psychological care with the development of a clearly structured, evidence-based assessment and treatment pathway to provide effective therapy for children and adolescents with ADHD. The Dundee ADHD Clinical Care Pathway (DACCP) uses standard protocols for assessment, titration and routine monitoring of clinical care and treatment outcomes, with much of the clinical work being nurse led. The DACCP has received international attention and has been used as a template for service development in many countries. This review describes the four key stages of the clinical care pathway (referral and pre-assessment; assessment, diagnosis and treatment planning; initiating treatment; and continuing care) and discusses translation of the DACCP into other healthcare systems. Tools for healthcare professionals to use or adapt according to their own clinical settings are also provided."

            "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder affecting up to 5% of children and adults and is underdiagnosed in many European countries. The process of access to care for this disorder is complex and variable across countries. In general, those affected, or their caregiver, will seek help through their primary care practitioners who are then often responsible for referral to other professionals for diagnosis and provision of treatment. Previous studies have highlighted that many barriers to recognition exist in primary care settings (such as misconceptions, lack of education or lack of resources), preventing access to care for this population and potentially affecting diagnosis rate. This systematic review aims to establish the barriers and facilitators with regard to attitudes, beliefs and experiences of ADHD within primary care. Electronic searches of multiple databases identified 3898 articles of which 48 met our inclusion criteria-primary care professionals from any country, understanding, knowledge, awareness, attitude and recognition of ADHD. Four main themes were identified: (1) need for education, (2) misconceptions and stigma, (3) constraints with recognition, management and treatment, and (4) multidisciplinary approach. The findings suggest many interacting factors are at play in the recognition of ADHD by primary care practitioners with a strong recurring theme of a significant need for better education on ADHD. Implications for research and practice are discussed, suggesting that educational interventions for primary care practitioners could improve the recognition of ADHD in this setting."

It is unclear, however, why some disturbed children are brought for treatment while others are not. To examine this issue in one community, children aged 7 through 11 were screened for behavioral problems using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL); 89 treated and 126 nontreated children, all of whom scored in the clinical range (above the 90th percentile) on the CBCL, were compared on measures of psychopathology, environmental factors and adaptive functioning. All the children were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children. There was no difference between the groups in the proportions receiving a psychiatric diagnosis, or in the proportions with more than one psychiatric disorder. The nontreated disturbed children were as likely as the treated ones to have attention deficit disorders, anxiety, and oppositional disorders, and to be failing in school. The treated children had more cases of conduct disorder and depressive disorders, and were more likely to be poor, male and black. Teachers reported twice as many behavioral problems in treated as in untreated children, suggesting that adults' discomfort with children's behavior may have been a more potent precipitator of referral than the children's failure to perform well at school. The findings suggest that many nontreated children may be no less impaired than those who receive treatment, and that other factors than severity of psychopathology may dictate which disturbed children receive mental health services."

Because students experiencing more barriers had lower quality of life, interventions are needed to improve students' overall illness management experience."

Adjusting for demographic variables, logistic regression analyses revealed that unmet need was significantly associated with: indicators of economic disadvantage, such as being on public assistance and not being covered by health insurance; opinions of the parents and children or adolescents that the latter had poor mental health; parental psychopathology; poor school grades; and parent-reported access barriers such as concern that the child would want to solve the problem unassisted, would refuse to attend mental health services, or would be hospitalized or taken away against the parent's will. No youth-reported access barriers were significantly associated with unmet need.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The economic correlates of unmet need may attain increased importance in the light of current reform in health care financing in the USA.

A total of 41 monozygotic (MZ) twins and 35 dizygotic twins were recruited. The psychological attributes and environmental information of children were evaluated. A significant correlation was found between twins in the diagnostic categories of any psychiatric disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)/hyperkinesis based on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire scale in MZ twins. Furthermore, fathers' authoritarian parenting style was positively correlated with the probability of any psychiatric disorders and oppositional/conduct disorders, whereas mothers' authoritative parenting style was negatively correlated with the probability of any psychiatric disorders and ADHD/hyperkinesis. The probability of emotional disorders was negatively correlated with scores on the Stressful Life Events Scale. These results collectively suggest that genetic and environmental elements, such as parental rearing style and stressful life events, may influence children's mental health.

Military personnel (n=11,527) were surveyed from May to August 2007 using a multistage whole cohort probability sampling method. A Chinese version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used for assessment, and a military-related socio-demographic questionnaire was used to describe the prevalence distribution. A unified survey was performed to investigate 11 different social situations. The short-form health survey was used to assess role impairment. The 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of social anxiety disorder were 3.34% (95% CI: 3.25-3.42%) and 6.22% (95% CI: 6.11-6.32%), respectively. Social anxiety disorder was associated with increased odds of depression, substance abuse, panic attacks/disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Childhood foster, female, stressful life events, younger age, and being divorced/widowed increase the incidence of social anxiety disorder. Treatment-seeking was relatively rare. Social anxiety disorder is a common disorder in military personnel in China, and it is a risk factor for subsequent depressive illness, substance abuse and other mental disorder. Early detection and treatment of social anxiety disorder are important because of the low rate of treatment-seeking."

Observed children's anxiety was assessed using modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale and compliant behaviours with modified form of Induction Compliance Checklist. Children in the first condition (complete intervention - contextual games and psychological accompaniment) were less anxious and more cooperative in the preoperative period and during the induction of anaesthesia than in the other three conditions. In particular, contextual activities (second condition) were found to be more efficient than psychological accompaniment (fourth condition), whereas the worst condition was proposing only distracting activities (third condition).

However, 80% of affected young people do not obtain professional help for depression and other mental health issues. Therefore, a key challenge is to find innovative and appealing ways to engage young people in learning to manage their mental health. Research suggests that young people prefer to access anonymous Web-based programs rather than get face-to-face help, which has led to the development of numerous smartphone apps.

Understanding the difficulties parents face seeking support for child anxiety disorders could inform targeted interventions to improve treatment access. The aims of the study were to identify barriers and facilitators to seeking and accessing professional support for child anxiety disorders, and ways to minimise these barriers. A qualitative interview study was conducted with parents of 16 children (aged 7-11 years) with anxiety disorders identified through screening in schools. Barriers and facilitators were identified in relation to four distinct stages in the help-seeking process: parents recognising the anxiety difficulty, parents recognising the need for professional support, parents contacting professionals, and families receiving professional support. Barriers and facilitators at each stage related to the child's difficulties, the role of the parent, and parent perceptions of professionals and services. Findings illustrate the need (1) for readily available tools to help parents and professionals identify clinically significant anxiety in children, (2) to ensure that families and professionals can easily access guidance on the help-seeking process and available support, and (3) to ensure existing services offer sufficient provision for less severe difficulties that incorporates direct support for parents."

Subgroups were identified on baseline multi-informant measures of variables most consistently associated with outcome (youth anxiety/diagnosis, impairment, family psychopathology/functioning). Subgroup membership was examined as a predictor/moderator of outcome across the four treatment conditions (CBT, Sertraline, CBT+Sertraline, pill placebo) at posttreatment (12 weeks) and open-extension follow-up (24 weeks). Four subgroups emerged: mild symptoms/impairment, moderate symptoms/impairment, moderate symptoms/impairment with family dysfunction/parental psychopathology, and severe symptoms/impairment. There were significant between-class differences on socioeconomic status (SES; lower reported SES in the moderate with family dysfunction/parental psychopathology class compared to the mild and moderate class) and age (older age in the severe symptoms class compared to the other three classes). Youth in the mild symptoms/impairment class showed lower posttreatment anxiety across conditions but reported significantly lower symptom severity at baseline. Controlling for demographic differences, response to treatment type did not differ across classes. Analyses indicate that elevated family dysfunction/parental psychopathology clusters primarily within one subgroup of anxious youth rather than mapping onto symptom severity, highlighting the utility of LPA for clarifying within-person combinations of predictor/moderator variables.

The most commonly reported reasons not to seek treatment among students who failed to report that they would definitely seek help were the preference to handle the problem alone (56.4%) and wanting to talk with friends or relatives instead (48.0%). Preference to handle the problem alone and feeling too embarrassed were also associated with significantly reduced odds of having at least some intention to seek help among students who failed to report that they would definitely seek help.

Attitudinal barriers and not structural barriers were found to be the most important reported reasons for this hesitation. Experimental research is needed to determine whether intention to seek help and, more importantly, actual help-seeking behavior could be increased with the extent to which intervention strategies need to be tailored to particular student characteristics. Given that the preference to handle problems alone and stigma and appear to be critical, there could be value in determining if internet-based psychological treatments, which can be accessed privately and are often build as self-help approaches, would be more acceptable than other types of treatments to student who report hesitation about seeking treatment."

            "abstract": "The aggregation of psychiatric disorders within families is well-known. The relative role of biological, psychogenic and socialization-related factors varies with the individual case. Another well-known fact is that parents play a very important role in influencing whether their child gets the right treatment when it is necessary. In this paper we highlight the complex links between childhood and adulthood through the presentation of three psychiatric cases. The first story starts with a lactation psychosis of a mother and ends when the daughter who became psychotic at the age of 15 enters adulthood. During these 18 years several psychiatrically relevant episodes happened in the family. During our care, step by step, in relation to emerging psychological problems, the family revealed more and more secrets, explaining past events, and offering a possibility for psychoeducation and psychotherapy. Knowledge concerning the life and psychiatric history of parents, in spite of the fears of the family, largely contributed to evaluating the symptoms of the daughter, reaching a diagnosis, initiating and maintaining therapy and achieving the present balanced state. The next two cases present the stories of two boys with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). One of the children was 6 years old when the family sought professional help, and now he is 11, the other child was 8 years old when the parents sought help and he is 15 now. The two families reacted differently to the offered treatment, but in both cases the family stayed continuously in touch with their child psychiatrists. With these two different stories on ADHD we would like to present several issues and successes which may surface during the long-term treatment of ADHD."

Tackling the myths and misinformation surrounding ADHD in the African American community can be one of the most difficult issues in mental illness circles. There is a lot of conflicting information about how African Americans are diagnosed, examined, and treated. This article clarifies some of the misconceptions and offers some comprehensibility to the issue of ADHD in African American youth. The incidence of ADHD is probably similar in African Americans and Caucasians. However, fewer African Americans are diagnosed with and treated for ADHD. That reality flies in the face of some perceptions in many African American communities. Reasons for this disparity have not been fully clarified and are most likely complex and numerous. Some barriers to treatment are driven by the beliefs of patients and their families, while others are the result of limitations in the health care system. Patient-driven obstacles to care include inadequate knowledge of symptoms, treatment, and consequences of untreated ADHD and fear of overdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. System-driven limitations include a lack of culturally competent health care providers, stereotyping or biases, and failure of clinicians to evaluate the child in multiple settings before diagnosis."

Barriers to service utilization were examined by prior depression severity status and college student status. Participants included a subsample of young adults ages 18-23 at time of recruitment who were participating in a longitudinal monthly study who completed both baseline and a 15-month follow-up assessment (N = 622, 80% of larger study). At month 15, 23% of young adults reported receiving mental health services in the past 12 months; 26% of young adults reported a perceived unmet need for mental health services at some point in the past 12 months. There were differences in demographic and mental health predictors of service utilization and perceived unmet need for services. Women, sexual minorities, those with moderate depression, those with more impairment from depression, and perceived past year poor mental health were associated with greater likelihood of receiving services. Similar demographic characteristics were associated with greater likelihood of perceiving unmet need for services. Barriers to service utilization differed by severity of depression symptoms and student status. Young adults have distinct reasons for not accessing mental health services; addressing these to improve accessibility to care remains critical."

            "abstract": "Severe irritability is one of the commonest reasons prompting referral to mental health services. It is frequently seen in neurodevelopmental disorders that manifest early in development, especially attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, irritability can also be conceptualized as a mood problem because of its links with anxiety/depressive disorders; notably DSM-5 currently classifies severe, childhood-onset irritability as a mood disorder. Investigations into the genetic nature of irritability are lacking although twin studies suggest it shares genetic risks with both ADHD and depression. We investigated the genetic underpinnings of irritability using a molecular genetic approach, testing the hypothesis that early irritability (in childhood/adolescence) is associated with genetic risk for ADHD, as indexed by polygenic risk scores (PRS). As a secondary aim we investigated associations between irritability and PRS for major depressive disorder (MDD). Three UK samples were utilized: two longitudinal population-based cohorts with irritability data from childhood (7 years) to adolescence (15-16 years), and one ADHD patient sample (6-18 years). Irritability was defined using parent reports. PRS were derived from large genome-wide association meta-analyses. We observed associations between ADHD PRS and early irritability in our clinical ADHD sample and one of the population samples. This suggests that early irritability traits share genetic risk with ADHD in the general population and are a marker of higher genetic loading in individuals with an ADHD diagnosis. Associations with MDD PRS were not observed. This suggests that early-onset irritability could be conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental difficulty, behaving more like disorders such as ADHD than mood disorders."

To provide insight into the distribution of depressive symptoms among children in rural Taiwan and measure the correlation between academic performance, we conducted a survey of 1655 randomly selected fourth and fifth-grade students at 92 sample schools in four relatively low-income counties or municipalities. Using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) we assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms in this sample, in addition to collecting other data, such as performance on a standardized math test as well as information on a number of individual and household characteristics. We demonstrate that the share of children with clinically significant symptoms is high: 38% of the students were at risk of general depression (depression score ≥ 16) and 8% of the students were at risk of major depression (depression score > 28). The results of the multivariate regression and heterogeneous analysis suggest that poor academic performance is closely associated with a high prevalence of depressive symptoms. Among low-performing students, certain groups were disproportionately affected, including girls and students whose parents have migrated away for work. Results also suggest that, overall, students who had a parent who was an immigrant from another country were at greater risk of depression. These findings highlight the need for greater resource allocation toward mental health services for elementary school students in rural Taiwan, particularly for at-risk groups."

Most evidence exists for the benefit of methylphenidate-IR with a few reports on other agents, including clonidine, atomoxetine, and lisdexamfetamine. Methylphenidate is the most common agent to treat ADHD in youth in LMICs.

Pharmacological treatments were generally more available than psychological interventions. Several barriers including stigma, cost, and lack of resources were reported to impact treatment acceptance. More research in LMICs is needed to improve and expand mental health services in these regions."

            "abstract": "Depression, depression stigma, and attitude toward psychiatric help are associated factors of suicide in adolescents. As parents are the main decision-makers of receiving professional help for their children's depression and suicide, parental factors influencing their children's suicide should be examined. Moreover, parents' help-seeking attitude for their own mental health problems could affect their children's mental health problems. Therefore, this study examined the serial mediation of adolescents' depression, depression stigma, and attitude toward psychiatric help in the relationship between parental attitude toward psychiatric help and the suicidal ideation of their children, using data of 103 parent-child pairs. A cross-sectional study was conducted by employing a self-administered survey. A serial mediation analysis was performed using Amos 25.0. Parental attitude toward psychiatric help directly and indirectly influenced children's suicidal ideation. Children's depression stigma, attitude toward psychiatric help, and depression mediated the relationship of parental attitude toward psychiatric help and their children's suicidal ideation. When parents have a more positive attitude toward psychiatric help, their children's suicidal ideation become more decreased. Enhancing only parental attitude toward psychiatric help may make a positive change on their children's suicidal ideation. The study findings imply that when developing and applying youth suicide prevention programs, how parents affect their children's suicidal ideation should be considered as well as adolescents' depression stigma, attitude toward psychiatric help, and depression. Given the results of this study, healthcare providers may better evaluate the effectiveness of their intervention programs for preventing adolescents' suicide."

Yet, 1.5 million each year do not receive needed mental health services and are unlikely, in general, to seek formal mental healthcare. We aimed to inform the development of a novel programme for young adult mental health by first eliciting their positive and negative prior experiences with mental health providers. Four focus groups with 19 young adults (aged 19-26 years) recruited from the community and with moderate to severe depression and/or anxiety were conducted in 2018 in a western US state. Participants' prior experiences with services/providers were elicited along six pre-defined recovery-related concepts: feeling listened to and validated, inclusivity, full information and consent, hope and optimism, connectedness, and change. Focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and uploaded into NVivo version 12 software. Two independent coders used deductive thematic analysis to identify patterned responses. Feeling listened to and validated appeared as a cornerstone of other recovery concepts. Participants discussed past negative experiences with psychiatrists and regret for being put on medications in their teenage years without information or options. Hope and optimism were low because of a general focus by professionals to address immediate symptom-based issues, rather than on improving their overall lives. Service providers' focus on medication-taking, and other one-size-fits-all tools, was interpreted as lacking a sincere desire to help. Young adults were particularly sensitive to inauthentic interactions and superficial strategies, which left them craving care that incorporated their whole lives, acknowledged biopsychosocial interconnections and prioritised improving their lives over 'feeling better' in a given moment. Mental health providers should consider developing programmes that shift focus away from an exclusively medical understanding of distress and towards holistic, educational or relational approaches that value body, mind, self-exploration and authentic connection."

Prolonged use of illicit drugs causes different psychiatric symptoms, but usage of short duration has also been reported to induce similar symptoms. It is less known how these psychiatric symptoms caused by occasional intake of illicit drugs are managed. The present study examined to which extent students in senior high school (third grade) have experienced psychiatric symptoms due to intake of illicit drugs, and to which extent they sought support in their nearby environment or professional help for these problems. The result shows that out of 104 18-year old students, 25 percent had tested illicit drugs, with no significant gender difference. 38 percent of the users reported psychiatric symptoms. In most of these cases either amphetamine or ecstasy had been used. The most common negative feelings reported were worry/anxiety, low spiritedness/depression, and feelings of unreality. The majority had not sought help for their problems among friends or adults. No one sought professional help. The frequency of adolescents that have tried drugs is on a level with other national surveys. Therefore it is most likely that the results regarding students who had experienced drug related psychiatric symptoms, and how they handled this experience, are representative for other eighteen-year-olds as well. It is of great concern that schools, medical services and social services have the knowledge that one fourth of the adolescents are trying illicit drugs, and almost four out of ten experience drug related psychiatric symptoms but most of them do not seek support or treatment for these symptoms."

Both pharmacological and nonpharmacological (behavioural) therapies are used to treat individuals with ADHD. Treatment with stimulant medications, which include methylphenidate and amphetamine, typically requires multiple daily doses to maintain efficacy. The frequency of treatment, coupled with the importance of timing of doses and the long-term nature of treatment, make noncompliance a particular issue in the treatment of ADHD. Studies report noncompliance rates of 20-65% with stimulant treatment, although there are only limited published studies and these show considerable individual variation. Noncompliance can arise through inadequate supervision of those receiving medication, leading to delayed or missed doses, or through the reluctance of individuals to take medication, which is influenced by a number of factors (e.g. social attitudes, pressures or worries surrounding medication use and the inconvenience of multiple daily doses). Two approaches are likely to increase compliance with stimulant treatment: effective once-daily formulations of medication and improved treatment information. The development of effective once-daily formulations for stimulant treatments removes the need for multiple daily doses, with the associated problems of ensuring adequate treatment supervision and personal privacy. Improved provision of education and information for individuals with ADHD, as well as their families and teachers, should help them address the issues surrounding stimulant medication and allow full participation in the treatment process. Together, these strategies should improve treatment compliance for individuals with ADHD."

The challenge for psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioners is to identify the modifiable symptoms and diagnosable disorders and develop a comprehensive treatment plan that reduces risk factors and promotes improved functioning. The current article presents an overview of evidence-based treatment strategies for co-occurring conditions. A child- and family-based collaborative approach with clear treatment goals in the context of an inter-professional care team, which includes the primary care provider, therapists, other relevant specialists, and teachers, has been shown to support children with ASD in becoming more successful in managing everyday stressors and regulating emotions and behaviors.

            "abstract": "Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at high risk of clinically significant anxiety, which can be related to lower treatment adherence and poorer health outcomes. Additionally, up to half of the parents/caregivers of children with CF experience clinically significant anxiety. Research has focussed on CF youth aged 13 years and older, leaving anxiety among school-aged children (aged 6-12 years) largely unstudied. This review aimed to synthesize research on anxiety among children with CF and their parents, examining prevalence, risk factors, and relationships between parent and child factors. Four electronic databases were searched, and publications were included if participants were children (or parents of children) with CF with a mean age between 6 and 12 years, and a standardized anxiety measure was used. Data from fourteen studies were extracted for descriptive synthesis; however, no studies focussed exclusively on the age range of 6-12 years. Results generally indicated that anxiety is highly prevalent in both child and parent populations; anxiety was the most prevalent mental health condition among children with CF, and anxiety was higher among CF populations than control populations among both children and parents. However, there were disparities, with some papers finding low rates of anxiety, and results on the relationship between anxiety and health outcomes varying greatly. Several risk factors were identified, but few were corroborated. There is an overall deficiency of research in this area, particularly examining the relationships between parent and child anxiety, and anxiety and health outcomes. Further research on suitable screening and intervention practices is also required."

Treatment-seeking African-American (n = 30) and white children (n = 139), with a current DSM-III-R anxiety disorder, were compared on sociodemographic background variables, clinical characteristics, and lifetime rates of specific DSM-III-R anxiety disorders. Overall, results suggested that the anxiety-disordered African-American and white children who sought treatment from an outpatient mental health facility were more similar than different. The two groups did, however, differ somewhat on several variables (trend only), including rates of school refusal, severity of primary anxiety disorder, lifetime prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder, and total scores on the Fear Survey Schedule for Children-Revised. More specifically, white children were more likely to present with school refusal and higher severity ratings, while African American children were more likely to have a history of posttraumatic stress disorder and score higher on the FSSC-R. The impact of these findings and the need for additional research are discussed."

Nearly half (48%) of the mothers reported high to very high psychological distress. Although 75% of mothers perceived a need for professional support, only 58% attempted to access this. Key barriers to accessing support were caregiving duties making it difficult to schedule appointments (45%) and not perceiving the mental health problem as serious enough to require help (36%). Individual counselling was the preferred type of support (66%) followed by professionally guided relaxation (49%) and education about mental health (47%).

The primary objective was to identify factors associated with worsening in ADHD severity during a 2-year follow-up period for subjects aged 6-17 years, who were receiving the same pharmacotherapy for 3-8 months before enrollment and had a Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-ADHD-Severity score of mild/lower and a CGI-ADHD-Improvement score of improved/very much improved. Multivariate logistic regression examined the association of factors with worsening in ADHD. Mixed-model repeated measures regression analyzed QoL in terms of change from baseline in CHIP-CE PRF scores. There were 704 subjects analyzed. Variables associated with worsening ADHD severity were parental occupation, poorer school outcomes, and use of psychoeducation; baseline treatment was not significant. Among the secondary objectives, initial use of atomoxetine (vs. stimulants) was associated with a significant improvement on the CHIP-CE PRF total score, with an adjusted treatment difference of -6.0 (95 % CI -7.9, -4.1) at 24 months. Additionally, the odds of stability (CGI-ADHD-S ≤ 3 over the 2-year period) were significantly lower for subjects initially responding to stimulants compared with atomoxetine (OR 0.5; 95 % CI 0.3, 0.8).

Despite these findings, the psychometric properties of the DASS remain untested in older adults, for whom the identification of efficient measures of these constructs is especially important. To determine the psychometric properties of the DASS 21-item version in older adults, we analyzed data from 222 medical patients seeking treatment to manage worry. Consistent with younger samples, a three-factor structure best fit the data. Results also indicated good internal consistency, excellent convergent validity, and good discriminative validity, especially for the Depression scale. Receiver operating curve analyses indicated that the DASS-21 predicted the diagnostic presence of generalized anxiety disorder and depression as well as other commonly used measures. These data suggest that the DASS may be used with older adults in lieu of multiple scales designed to measure similar constructs, thereby reducing participant burden and facilitating assessment in settings with limited assessment resources."

However, it is still unclear how to best implement it in routine clinical care. 123 children (8-12 years) with anxiety disorders underwent a 12-week ICBT programme with limited therapist support. Participants were assessed 3- and 12-month post-ICBT (3MFU and 12MFU, respectively). Non-remitters who still fulfilled diagnostic criteria for their principal anxiety disorder at 3MFU were offered additional manualised \"face-to-face\" (F2F) CBT. The aim of the study was to emulate a stepped-care model of health care delivery, where the long-term treatment gains of ICBT as well as the potential benefit of proving addition treatment to non-remitters of ICBT were evaluated. Remitters of ICBT (n = 73) continued to improve throughout the study period (pre-ICBT to 12MFU; Cohen's d = 2.42). At 12MFU, 89% (n = 65) were free from their principal anxiety disorder. Of all the participants classed as non-remitters at 3MFU (n = 37), 48.6% (n = 18) accepted the offer to receive additional F2F CBT. These participants also improved with a large effect from pre-ICBT to 12MFU (Cohen's d = 2.27), with the largest effect occurring during F2F CBT. At 12MFU, 83% (n = 15) were free from their principal anxiety disorders. The majority of non-remitters declining additional F2F CBT (63.2%; n = 12) did so due to already receiving treatment at their local CAMHS, prior to 3MFU. The effects of ICBT for anxiety disorders are durable at least up to 1 year after the end of treatment. Patients who fail to fully benefit from ICBT improved further with additional F2F sessions at our clinic, suggesting that it may be feasible to implement ICBT within a stepped-care model of health care delivery."

This study evaluated PK and PD genetic variation and the clinical use of such testing in treatment seeking patients with bipolar disorder (BP) and major depressive disorder (MDD) and history of multiple drug failures/treatment resistance. Methods: Consecutive depressed patients evaluated at the Mayo Clinic Depression Center over a 10-year study time frame (2003-2013) were included in this retrospective analysis. Diagnoses of BP or MDD were confirmed using a semi-structured diagnostic interview. Clinical rating scales included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD24), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Questionnaire. Clinically selected patients underwent genotyping of cytochrome P450 CYP2D6/CYP2C19 and the serotonin transporter SLC6A4. PK and PD differences and whether clinicians incorporated test results in providing recommendations were compared between the two patient groups. Results: Of the 1795 patients, 167/523 (31.9%) with BP and 446/1272 (35.1%) with MDD were genotyped. Genotyped patients had significantly higher self-report measures of depression and anxiety compared to non-genotyped patients. There were significantly more CYP2C19 poor metabolizer (PM) phenotypes in BP (9.3%) vs. MDD patients (1.7%, p = 0.003); among participants with an S-allele, the rate of CYP2C19 PM phenotype was even higher in the BP (9.8%) vs. MDD (0.6%, p = 0.003). There was a significant difference in the distribution of SLC6A4 genotypes between BP (l/l = 28.1%, s/l = 59.3%, s/s = 12.6%) and MDD (l/l = 31.4%, s/l = 46.1%, s/s = 22.7%) patients (p < 0.01). Conclusion: There may be underlying pharmacogenomic differences in treatment seeking depressed patients that potentially have impact on serum levels of CYP2C19 metabolized antidepressants (i.e., citalopram / escitalopram) contributing to rates of efficacy vs. side effect burden with additional potential risk of antidepressant response vs. induced mania. The evidence for utilizing pharmacogenomics-guided therapy in MDD and BP is still developing with a much needed focus on drug safety, side effect burden, and treatment adherence."

Both teacher's and parent's questionnaires by Rutter were utilized. Two pediatricians carried out semi-structured interviews of 10-12 minutes for every child and diagnosed their mental state. In part 1 (previously reported), the Japanese version of Rutter's questionnaires was found to be satisfactory for screening, and the diagnostic interview used in this survey was shown to be a reliable tool for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders of the adolescent. In part 2, the prevalence of psychiatric disorders was studied in the 592 school children who were the subject of the preliminary survey. In the present study, a total of 1,992 children from 5 junior high schools in Gunma prefecture were surveyed cross-sectionally of whom 1,672 (84.3%) screened negative, and 312 (15.7%) positive. The positives and a part of the negatives were randomly selected for interviews, and were diagnosed as to whether they have psychiatric disorders or not by the criteria of Rutter. The overall prevalence rate of diagnosed psychiatric disorders in these school children was 14.8%, (20.1% for males and 8.3% for females). The prevalence rate is significantly higher in males than in females. Disorders diagnosed were classified into emotional, conduct, and mixed disorder, based on Rutter's classification. No cases of schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa were found here as well as in the preliminary survey. The ratio of emotional to conduct disorders was 1.9. Prevalence of conduct disorder in females was one seventh that in males. This study also revealed that the questionnaire method is effective for screening for psychiatric disorders in children, but is not sufficient for differentiating types of disorders. Therefore the diagnostic interview was shown to be useful not only for epidemiological surveys but also for mental health services."

The aims of the study were to identify the Italian mental health services for ADHD in adults, describe the diagnostic and treatment procedures they follow, and compare this offer with the recommendations of the German and English guidelines. The centres, that adopt a clinical and assessment protocol for adult ADHD diagnosis (carried out by specifically trained personnel) and prescribe pharmacological treatment for adult ADHD, were selected from the list of accredited services provided by the Appendix B.2 of the ISTISAN 16/37 Reports of the ISS. An ad-hoc survey including open-ended and close-ended questions was sent to each selected centre in February 2020. The overall picture resulting from the data analysis was compared with the recommendations of the German and English guidelines. The present survey shows that only a few centres are specialised in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in adults in Italy. Furthermore, there are no national guidelines for adult ADHD in Italy. The collected data also suggest that there is no a unified practice shared by the Centres both for the patient's transition from child and adolescent to adult mental health services and for the diagnostic-therapeutic process. It is therefore crucial to create specific protocols and develop national guidelines to better identify and diagnose ADHD in adults and provide targeted and more efficient multimodal treatments."

            "abstract": "Research reveals veterinary medical students and professionals are at increased risk for mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and suicidality, yet many individuals in distress do not seek professional mental health services. Although some barriers to accessing services have been identified, other factors, including how professional culture influences service underutilization, are poorly understood. In this study, we used a mixed-methods approach to investigate 573 veterinary students' perceptions of barriers to seeking mental health services and potential mechanisms to lessen them. We identified four barrier themes: stigma, veterinary medical culture and identities, services, and personal factors. Participants' suggestions for reducing barriers to seeking help related to three themes: culture, services, and programmatic factors. We compared perceptions of barriers based on the severity of participants' self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety and found that participants with severe depression, compared with participants with mild depression, were more likely to perceive barriers related to veterinary medical culture. The results of this study provide a deeper understanding of veterinary students' barriers to seeking mental health services and, in particular, how these barriers, as both individual and sociocultural phenomena, are often interrelated and mutually reinforcing."

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) was added to the DSM-5 in recognition of this public health need. Currently there are no well-established, evidence-based pharmacological or psychosocial treatments specifically for DMDD. Here, we focus on psychosocial interventions. In addition to reviewing published research, we present preliminary, open trial data on a novel exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting severe irritability, as is present in DMDD.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      In the published literature, parent management training (PMT) comprises parent-based interventions designed to treat youth disruptive behavior. Child-based interventions for disruptive behavior include CBT focused on social cognition and problem-solving. Based on identified treatment gaps for severe irritability in children and adolescents, novel psychosocial interventions are being developed. We have developed a CBT for severe irritability that integrates exposure techniques, drawn from anxiety treatment, with selected PMT techniques. Data from an open pilot trial (N=10) suggest feasibility.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Promising psychosocial treatments are being developed for DMDD.

Analyzing stressors and \"internalizing\" symptoms offers a more balanced picture of the type of social and mental health services that may be needed for this population. The present study aims to: 1) estimate the prevalence of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Haitian immigrant students; and 2) examine factors associated with depression and PTSD to identify potential areas of intervention that may enhance psychosocial health outcomes among immigrant youth from Haiti in the U.S.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A stratified random sample of Haitian immigrant students enrolled in Boston public high schools was selected for participation; 84% agreed to be interviewed with a standardized questionnaire.

            "abstract": "A number of evidence-based treatments are available for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including pharmacological, psychosocial, or a combination of the two treatments. For a significant number of children diagnosed with ADHD, however, these treatments are not utilized or adhered to for the recommended time period. Given that adherence to treatment regimens is necessary for reducing the symptoms of ADHD, it is crucial to develop a comprehensive understanding of why adherence rates are so low. The current review examines the literature to date that has directly explored utilization and adherence issues related to the treatment of ADHD in order to identify the key barriers to treatment. This review focused on four main factors that could account for the poor rates of treatment utilization and adherence: personal characteristics (socio-demographic characteristics and diagnostic issues), structural barriers, barriers related to the perception of ADHD, and barriers related to perceptions of treatment for ADHD. This review included 63 papers and covered a variety of barriers to treatment that have been found in research to have an impact on treatment adherence. Based on this review, we conclude that there are complex and interactive relationships among a variety of factors that influence treatment utilization and adherence. Four main gaps in the literature were identified: (1) there is limited information about barriers to psychosocial interventions, compared to pharmacological interventions; (2) there is a limited variety of research methodology being utilized; (3) treatment barrier knowledge is mostly from parents' perspectives; and (4) treatment utilization and treatment adherence are often studied jointly. Information from this review can help practitioners to identify potential barriers to their clients being adherent to treatment recommendations."

            "abstract": "Children with autism commonly suffer from comorbid functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) and anxiety. The raised prevalence of both conditions in autism suggests complex reciprocal relationships, which are seldom explored in non-treatment-seeking FGID. The relationships between subtypes of FGID and anxiety are also unclear. This study recruited boys with autism and age-matched typically developing (TD) boys, aged 4-11 years, who were not actively seeking help for gastrointestinal problems. Their parents completed the Rome IV Diagnostic Questionnaires for Pediatric FGID. Four groups of children with and without autism/FGID were identified and compared on their anxiety level using the Spence children's anxiety scale. In 69 boys with autism and 69 age-matched TD boys, FGID were identified in 22 and 16 boys, respectively. ANCOVA demonstrated a significant interaction effect of autism and FGID on anxiety (F[1, 129] = 5.43, p = 0.021), while conditional logistic regression identified an interaction effect of autism and anxiety on the odds of FGID (OR 1.038, 95% CI 1.002-1.075, p = 0.038). Explorative post hoc analysis showed higher anxiety in functional nausea and vomiting disorder (p = 0.033) and functional abdominal pain disorder (p = 0.029) among boys with autism than TD boys with the same respective subtypes of FGID. In summary, among prepubertal boys with autism, the presence of FGID that are non-treatment-seeking in nature, has a significantly stronger association with higher levels of anxiety than TD boys. The strength of association may be more prominent in subtypes of FGID. Possible pathomechanisms including the underlying microbiota spectra and inflammatory paths should be explored in future studies. LAY SUMMARY: Anxiety and gastrointestinal problems are common symptoms in autism. Given that gut health could be linked to emotions, their association in young boys with autism was studied. The presence of nausea vomiting, or abdominal pain were associated with raised anxiety among boys with autism, yet this was not observed in typically developing boys. This suggests that anxiety among autistic children could be partly explained by the presence of FGID."

            "abstract": "Children and young people are vulnerable to developing mental health problems. In South Africa, this vulnerability is compounded by contextual risk factors such as community violence and poverty. However, mental health services are scarce and costly, which precludes access for many. Universal school-based mental health programmes can prevent the onset of mental health problems in children and young people and have been implemented to good effect in high-income settings. We sought to understand stakeholder perspectives on what such a programme should focus on and how it could be implemented in practice within the South African context. We interviewed children and young people (n = 22), parents (n = 21), teachers (n = 17), and school mental health counsellors (n = 6) recruited from two schools in the Western Cape, South Africa. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. We generated three overarching themes: 'the value of a mental health and well-being programme', 'content and delivery', and 'practicalities and logistics'. Participants were optimistic about the potential value of such a programme. Developing content that was appropriate for group delivery, flexible and timed to fit within the school schedule was important. Finding ways to make activities meaningful for large classes was important logistically, as was determining to what extent leaners would feel comfortable participating alongside their peers. Participants felt that outsiders, as opposed to school staff, should deliver the programme and that parents should be involved where possible. Developing a mental health programme for children and young people in the South African context requires careful understanding of who the key role players in such an intervention will be and how exactly they want to be involved and, how the challenges associated with practicalities and logistics can be overcome."

Accessing services and the challenges associated with securing a definitive diagnosis of ADHD in adulthood was an 'uphill struggle', often due to sceptical and negative attitudes towards ADHD by healthcare professionals. ADHD-related impairment had an overwhelmingly chaotic impact on every aspect of patients' lives and many felt ill equipped to cope. A persistent sense of failure and missed potential from living with the impact of ADHD impairment had led to an accumulated psychosocial burden, especially among those diagnosed from late adolescence onwards. In contrast, positive adjustment was facilitated by a younger age at diagnosis. Although medication was perceived as necessary in alleviating impairment, many felt strongly that by itself, it was inadequate. Additional support in the form of psychological therapies or psycho-education was strongly desired. However, few patients had access to non-pharmacological treatment. In some, medication use was often inadequately monitored with little or no follow-up by healthcare professionals, leading to poor adherence and a sense of abandonment from the healthcare system.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The findings suggest that the unmet needs of adults with ADHD are substantial and that there is a wide gap between policy and current practice in England."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The notion of a second-generation or 'children of survivors' syndrome was studied by obtaining information about the extent to which psychological complaints of postwar children seeking treatment could be compared to their non-treatment-seeking brothers and sisters of roughly the same age.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      46 treatment-seeking subjects, postwar children of Dutch World War II victims, and 22 brothers and sisters, who had not applied for treatment, answered psychological questionnaires about symptoms, psychological traits, coping styles, life events and impact of events. Mean score differences are tested for significance with the t test (two-tailed).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Statistically significant higher mean scores for several treatment-seeking client groups were consistently obtained on nearly all symptom subscales of the SCL-90, the traits of neuroticism, anxiety, depression, pessimism, and inward expression of negative emotions, as well as the coping style of depressive reaction and PTSD-related characteristics of intrusion and denial of experiences. These differences also remained when the data for the two sexes were separately analyzed or, alternatively, a sibling and sex match were included in the between-groups comparison.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our findings tend to corroborate those of others, expressing doubts as to the ubiquity of enduring pernicious effects of parental traumatic wartime experiences on their offspring. Some members of the second generation seem to be adversely affected, others apparently are not. This conclusion may even be extended to members within the same families, which would seriously call into question the generality of intrafamilial transmission routes. These routes act selectively upon members of the same family."

            "abstract": "Parental attitudes, religious beliefs, and other sociocultural factors have all been recognized to influence help-seeking patterns in relation to child psychiatric morbidity. But few systematic studies have addressed this issue in the Arab region. In this study, we investigated the help-seeking preferences for mental health problems in a community sample. 325 parents contacted as part of a community-based study of child psychiatric disorders were surveyed using a semistructured interview schedule. Only 38% of those surveyed indicated they would seek help from mental health specialists in the event of psychiatric problems developing in a family member, including their children. Main reasons given for nonconsultation were reluctance to acknowledge that a member of their family has a mental illness, stigma attached to attending mental health services, and the skepticism about the usefulness of mental health services. Willingness to utilize psychiatric services was associated with better parental education, occupation, and socioeconomic status. Our results suggest that sociocultural factors and parental perceptions may have a major effect on whether children with psychiatric disturbance receive professional help."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity are highly prevalent, impairing, and costly conditions, affecting about 10% of children each. Research indicates heightened prevalence of childhood obesity among youth with ADHD. However, more research is needed, examining comorbid ADHD among youth with overweight/obesity (OV/OB) from diverse demographic backgrounds and effects on medically relevant behaviors. The aim of the current study was to examine the prevalence of ADHD in a racially diverse sample of youth in a weight management clinic. Furthermore, we examined the effects of race, rurality, and ADHD on weight status and health behaviors in this under-researched population.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Participants included 1003 patients (Mage = 12.55; 58% female; 67% Black/African American; MBMI Z-Score = 2.54; 98.6% with obesity) in a pediatric weight management clinic serving a rural and urban/suburban area in the southern United States. Parent-reported demographics, ADHD diagnosis, and child health behaviors were recorded.\n    \n\n\n          Result:\n        \n      \n      In total, 17.6% (n = 177) of the sample had an ADHD diagnosis. ADHD status interacted with race to predict standardized body mass index (BMIz), and rurality predicted higher BMIz. Children with comorbid ADHD had significantly more meals per day and fewer active days compared with children with OV/OB without ADHD.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      ADHD prevalence was higher in this diverse sample of children seeking obesity treatment (17.6%) compared with the prevalence nationally (9%-10%) and in other obesity samples. Comorbid ADHD was related to higher weight status among racial minority youth and increased engagement in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors often targeted in weight management treatment. It is critical to screen for ADHD in pediatric specialty clinics and assess healthy lifestyle behaviors."

Beliefs about putative etiologies for epilepsy were not uniform as some considered environmental and external factors such as high environmental temperatures, electric shocks, loud music, and fever as causes of seizures while others listed bad experiences, stress, trauma, and fear as possible causes. Epilepsy was seen by some as a divine punishment or resulting from black magic. Most considered epilepsy shameful and an obstacle to children attending school. Despite local differences, there was a uniform belief that epilepsy is incurable by Western medicine and people usually resort to traditional healers. A variety of rituals performed by local healers to treat epilepsy were described.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Misconceptions about epilepsy may contribute to stigmatization in this population; this may in turn contribute to a high treatment gap in this group. As a result, the majority of Roma children with epilepsy are likely to leave school early, are greatly limited in their choice of spouse (particularly girls), and marriages often occur between people with epilepsy or those with a family history of epilepsy."

            "abstract": "In this study, we consecutively recruited treatment-seeking young autistic adults without intellectual impairment aged 16-30 years who presented to a mental health service and evaluated general health (distress, quality of life, and disability), functioning (work loss days and social functioning), and mood symptoms (depression, anxiety, and stress) in those diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (n = 96). This group was compared to young adults presenting to the same service with primary mental health disorders (depression, n = 343; bipolar, n = 132; psychosis, n = 166; and anxiety, n = 303). This study also investigated the influence of mood symptoms on general health and functioning in the autism spectrum disorder group. Young autistic adults reported significant general health and functioning impairments that were of similar degree to those presenting with primary mental health disorders. Interestingly, the autistic group also reported similarly high levels of mood symptoms to those with primary depressive and anxiety disorders. In the autistic group, depressive symptoms were strongly associated with distress, quality of life, and work loss days, while stress symptoms were strongly associated with disability. This study highlights further research, and mental health services are required specifically targeting young autistic adults to address their significant unmet needs."

            "abstract": "Screening for adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) can help prevent and reduce adverse outcomes on child development, including increased risk for anxiety disorders. Emerging studies strongly support the inclusion of community-level adversities in ACE screeners to consider diverse contexts and populations. Recent studies suggest that community violence exposure (CVE) may have a distinct impact on youth mental health. Although recent studies have examined the association between ACEs, CVE, and mental health in primary care settings, this association has not been examined on treatment-seeking children in urban mental health settings. The present study employs a mediation model using the PROCESS macro to examine community violence exposure mediating the effect on the association between ACEs and somatic symptoms (SS) on a sample of anxious treatment-seeking children. A total of 98 participants (Mage = 11.7, SD = 3.79, 51.6% males, 54.1% ethnic minority children) who sought services at a specialized anxiety clinic completed self-report measures. Results indicated that exposure to ACEs is associated with endorsement of somatic symptoms as a result of reporting hearing, witnessing, or experiencing CVE. Evidence of mediation was found in a statistically significant indirect effect of ACEs on SS through CREV (Effect = .17, 95% CI = .069-.294). These findings support recent evidence that CVE is a distinct ACE as it contributes to toxic stress similar to individual-level ACEs. The use of a comprehensive ACE screening that includes CVE is warranted, particularly when working with culturally and socioeconomically diverse populations, as it would better capture a broader range of adversities across demographic groups."

            "abstract": "The authors sought to identify the correlates of mental health services utilization and unmet need for these services among a sample of adolescent males. We hypothesized that our findings would replicate and extend those of the recent Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA) study, which found that parental factors play a major role in their children's unmet mental health care needs. Our study involved an evaluation of mental health service utilization and unmet need during the prior 2 years, as reported by the subjects at a follow-up assessment at age 16. Four factors were found to predict increased mental health services utilization, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) among the adolescent males, the father's alcohol use disorder, and the mother's amphetamine use disorder. One factor was found to predict decreased utilization, the father's cannabis use disorder. Four factors significantly predicted unmet treatment need, including conduct disorder, the mother's amphetamine use disorder, a higher number of siblings, and a parental history of having had a childhood anxiety disorder. The results of this study suggest that parental psychopathology, parental substance abuse, the presence of conduct disorder, and an increased number of siblings act as barriers to adequate mental health treatment among adolescents. These findings confirm the crucial role that parental factors play in the treatment utilization and the unmet treatment need of their children, and also suggest that an increased number of siblings can also be associated with unmet treatment need."
