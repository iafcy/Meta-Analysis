ABSTRACT
Objective: The Bergen Child Study is a longitudinal study of child mental health from the city of Bergen, Norway. We
present methods and results from the first wave of the study, focusing on prevalence of disorders, associations with risk
factors, and the use of services. Method: The target population included all 9,430 children attending grades 2 to 4 in
Bergen schools during the academic year 2002/2003. The main screening instrument was the Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire, whereas diagnoses were based on the Development and Well-Being Assessment. Information about child
and family risk factors and service use was also obtained in this second stage. Results: In the first phase, the teacher
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was obtained for 9,155 (97%) of the target children and the matching parent
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for 6,297 (67%); 1,011 children (11%) were assessed with the Development and
Well-Being Assessment in the second phase. The weighted prevalence for any DSM-IV psychiatric disorder was 7.0%
(95% confidence interval 5.6%Y8.5%). Disorders were associated with age, gender, learning difficulties, family type, and
poverty. Although 75% of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder had been in contact with specialist mental
health services, this was true for only 13% of those with pure emotional disorders. Conclusions: The overall prevalence of
psychiatric disorders in children is relatively low in this Norwegian sample, when assessed with the Development and Well-
Being Assessment. Children with emotional disorders have limited access to specialist services. J. Am. Acad. Child
Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2007;46(4):438Y447. Key Words: mental health, prevalence, risk factors, service use.
Population surveys have shown that mental disorders
are common and often of early onset. Lifetime risk is
close to 50%, with half of all cases starting before 14
years of age (Kessler et al., 2005). Most cases receive no
treatment, and for treated cases, the delay before
treatment may be decades (Wang et al., 2005). These
findings represent major challenges for societies to
provide effective treatment and prevention.

Prior epidemiological surveys have sometimes reported
extremely high prevalence rates for mental disorders in
children and adolescents (Bird et al., 1988). Stricter
impairment criteria in recent versions of the diagnostic
systems as well as improved methodology may be the
main reasons for a greater agreement and generally
lower prevalence estimates in more recent surveys
(Costello et al., 2003; Roberts et al., 1998). For adult
surveys, a common set of methods has been intro-
duced by the World Health Organization (Kessler and
Ustun, 2004), but this is not the case for child and
adolescent surveys. However, one recent methodo-
logical approach used in a range of settings and
countries is the Development and Well-Being Assess-
ment (DAWBA; Goodman et al., 2000). This
structured multi-informant interview, which can be
administered by lay interviewers but is scored by
experienced clinical raters, has hitherto been used in
completed or ongoing studies from 12 countries.
Published prevalence estimates of youth mental
disorders according to the DAWBA have varied
from 7% in a rural Brazilian setting (Goodman
et al., 2005a) to 15% for studies from Bangladesh
(Mullick and Goodman, 2005) and Russia (Goodman
et al., 2005b).
Not only prevalence for disorders but also risk factors
may differ across countries. Recent studies have largely
confirmed associations with child factors such as gender
and age, with a higher rate of behavioral problems in
younger boys and a higher rate of emotional problems
in older girls (Canino et al., 2004; Costello et al., 2003;
Ford et al., 2004). Learning disorders in the child also
increases the risk of emotional and behavioral disorders
(Ford et al., 2004; Goodman et al., 2005b). For family
factors, however, recent findings are more ambiguous.
Children from single-parent families appear to be at
greater risk, but not in all studies (Canino et al., 2004;
Goodman et al., 2005b). For traditional socioeconomic
markers including low parent education and income,
no increased risk was found in several recent studies
(Canino et al., 2004; Goodman et al., 2005b).
However, an important finding emerging from this
literature seems to be that risk factors for mental
disorders vary not only between cultures and societies
but also with type of disorder, as suggested 25 years ago
by Gillberg (1983).
The Nordic countries are generally characterized by
high living standards and low economic and social
stratification. However, given the multitude and
complexity of risk factors for mental disorders, this
guarantees neither generally good mental health in
children nor the availability of effective services. In this
article, we present the first large-scale survey of DSM-IV
and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders in the Nordic
countries, focusing on prevalence, risk factors, and
rates of service use.
METHOD
Sample
The target population of the Bergen Child Study of mental health
(BCS) consisted of all children in the city of Bergen, Norway,
attending primary school grades 2 to 4 (7Y9 years of age) in the fall
of 2002. The total number of children attending these grades was
9,430. It is not considered appropriate to ask about race or ethnicity
in Norway, but the population is predominantly white. In 2002
6.4% of the Norwegian population were immigrants, and 66%
were from non-Western countries. In the present sample, 6.7%
of children spoke a foreign language at home, and 12% had an
immigrant parent.
Setting
Bergen is the second largest city of Norway, with a total
population of around 235,000. All 79 primary schools in Bergen
took part in the study; all were mainstream public schools except for
four special education public schools and 7 private schools. The
special education schools are restricted to children with mental
retardation. The private schools are based on religious or ideological
orientation, except for an international school in which the teaching
language is English. Each community has a public school
psychology service as well as medical staff (nurse and doctor)
working part time in schools. Bergen has four public specialist child
and adolescent outpatient mental health clinics offering assessment
and treatment at no cost to youths and their families. Referrals to
specialist mental health services are usually provided by school
services or family doctors. Parental consent is required for referral to
school or specialist services.
Study Design
In the first screening phase, a four-page questionnaire was
administered to parents and teachers through the schools in fall
2002. This questionnaire covered a wide range of symptoms as well
as associated functional impairment. The second parent interview
phase started during spring 2003 (mean age of child, 8.8 years [SD
0.9]) and included a structured psychiatric interview with parents of
screen-positive children and parents of a random sample of screen-
negative children (see below). Information on family type, socio-
demographic variables, and service use for mental health problems
was also obtained in this second stage. The present report is based
on findings from these first two phases. A third direct assessment
phase included assessment of cognitive and motor function, specific
symptoms, and physical tests in selected subgroups of children from
the second phase. The third phase will deal with aspects of disorders
not central to themes presented here and will be detailed in other
publications from the Bergen Child Study. Repeated assessments are

planned at 3-year intervals until adulthood, collecting longitudinal
data on mental health for this cohort. The study was approved by
the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics, West-
Norway, and the Norwegian Data Inspectorate.
Screening Phase
The screening questionnaire covered a wide range of emotional
and behavioral symptoms as well as associated functional impair-
ment. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ;
Goodman, 1999, 2001) was chosen as the main instrument for the
most frequent problem areas. Here, a total difficulties score is calcu-
lated by combining four problem subscale scores (emotional, con-
duct, hyperactivity-inattention, and peer problems), each containing
five items. The SDQ also includes an impact supplement tapping
functional impairment, in which informants are asked about severity
and duration of symptoms, distress, interference with daily activities,
and burden of the child_s symptoms to others. Additional scales
focusing on specific problem areas were included in the screening
questionnaire. As a measure of concurrent validity of the SDQ, all
oppositional defiant disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) items from the DSM-IV and ICD-10 classifica-
tions, consistent with the SNAP questionnaire (Swanson et al.,
2001), were included in the screening questionnaire. Autistic
symptoms were covered by the Autism Spectrum Screening
Questionnaire (Ehlers and Gillberg, 1993; Posserud et al., 2006).
Five specific items were added for obsessive-compulsive symptoms
(Thomsen, 1998) and another five items tapping tic symptoms were
also included (Apter et al., 1993). The parent version also contained
five items covering eating problems, adapted from the Great
Ormond Street Criteria (Nicholls et al., 2000), and one item on sleep
problems. The teacher questionnaire also included two items
on sluggish cognitive tempo. It took parents and teachers about
20 minutes to complete the four-page questionnaire, which was
administered along with the informed consent form through
the schools.
Teacher questionnaires were obtained for 9,155 children (97.1%
of the target population). This represents the BTeacher Ques-
tionnaire[ sample. Parents were contacted via school and asked
permission for the teacher data to be stored on an Bidentified child[
basis and to complete questionnaires themselves. For those who did
not have parental permission, teacher data were stored without
personal identification. Matching teacher and parent questionnaires
were obtained for 6,297 identified children. This represents the
BCombined Questionnaire[ sample
Children were defined as screen positives if (1) the SDQ total
difficulties score was above the 90th percentile cutoff according to
parents or teachers, (2) there was severe impairment according to
parents or teachers on the SDQ impact section (regardless of
symptom scores), or (3) if the score on Bnarrow-band[ scales
exceeded the 98th percentile cutoff.
Interview Phase
From the Combined Questionnaire sample, the parents of all
screen-positive children and the parents of a random sample of
screen-negative children (see below) were invited to take part in the
interview phase. This diagnostic phase consisted of the DAWBA, a
psychiatric interview originally developed for the 1999 British Child
and Adolescent Mental Health Survey (Goodman et al., 2000). The
DAWBA is fully structured, but includes open-ended questions
whenever a certain amount of symptoms and impact has been
reported to allow for the respondent_s own description of the
problem. The version of the DAWBA used here covers in detail the
common problem areas such as anxiety, depression, ADHD, and
behavior problems as well as less frequent areas such as autism, tics,
and eating disorders (DAWBA Interviews and Questionnaires,
2006). After a 2-day training course on the administration of the
interview, 10 interviewers (mainly social sciences graduates) made
arrangements with parents for interviews mainly at local community
health clinics. An electronic format allowed local storage on laptops
before transfer of data to a computer scoring program where data
and text from all sections are presented to the clinical rater.
Questionnaire data from teachers were included for the scoring of
the oppositional defiant disorder and ADHD sections, allowing
raters to combine information from parents and teachers when
rating these sections. At the interview, parents were asked whether
the child had learning difficulties or any physical disability. If they
answered Byes,[ then they were asked about impact on a 4-point
scale. Parents were also asked about family type, parental education,
and household income. Finally, parents were asked whether the
child had experienced problems leading to contact with relevant
child services.
All of the interviews were scored by two experienced child
psychiatrists (E.H. and an independent psychiatrist) who had
completed the online training available for the DAWBA as well as a
2-day training session for raters. When in doubt, cases were flagged
and discussed between raters. All diagnoses were finally reviewed
and discussed with a third child psychiatrist (R.G.) who developed
this instrument to ensure that rating thresholds were comparable
to those of previous DAWBA studies. Interrater . values were 0.91
for any disorder, 0.93 for emotional and conduct disorders, and 1.0
for ADHD.
Participation in the Interview Phase
From the Combined Questionnaire sample, 1,446 children were
screen positive, and their parents were mailed invitation letters, with
up to one written reminder being allowed by the ethics committee
(but no telephone or personal contact). The final number of
completed interviews for screen-positive children was 645 (44.6%
of invited). A random 15% of screen-negative children were also
invited to the interview phase (n = 732), resulting in 364 completed
interviews for this group (49.7% of invited). Parents of two screen-
negative children took part in the interview phase at their own
instigation; these two children were given a weight of 1 (see below)
for the analyses of the second phase data. Figure 1 presents a
flowchart of the two phases.
Statistical Analyses
To estimate diagnostic characteristics of the screened popula-
tion, we calculated probability weights for the sample participating
in the second diagnostic phase. These probabilities were derived
from a logistic regression model with participation in the
diagnostic phase as the dependent variable, and total SDQ scores
for teacher and parent as independent variables. The weights
reflect the number of individuals in the first phase whom each
record in the second phase represents. Weights were calculated
both for the Combined Questionnaire sample (N = 6,297) and for
the Teacher Questionnaire sample (N = 9,155). The latter group
included children for whom a parent questionnaire with an ID
matching a teacher questionnaire could not be found. For the
calculation of weights for the Teacher Questionnaire sample,

missing values for parent scores were replaced using a linear
regression model. Full data on correlates were available for 996 of
the 1,011 children (98.5%) with DAWBA assessments. To
facilitate the comparison of adjusted and unadjusted analyses, all
analyses for associations between risk factors and diagnoses were
restricted to these 996 subjects. The prevalence of the main
diagnostic groups was calculated by weighting back both to the
Combined Questionnaire sample and the Teacher Questionnaire
sample. Other analyses were weighted back to the Teacher
Questionnaire sample alone because this represented 97% of the
target population. Weighting was carried out using the survey
(svy) commands of the Statistics/Data Analysis Program (STATA
9.1, Stata Corp., College Station, TX). Unadjusted, simple,
logistic regression analyses were performed using each diagnosis
(0 = no, 1 = yes) as the dependent variable, and risk factors as
independent variables. Adjusted multiple analyses were done by
including all of the risk factors that were statistically significant in
the unadjusted analyses. Furthermore, we used logistic regression
to determine the odds of comorbidity between any two of the
main diagnostic groups (emotional disorders, behavior disorders,
and ADHD) while adjusting for the third group. We examined
associations with risk factors for the main diagnostic categories
using x2 for trend.
RESULTS
Parent Response Bias
Whereas 97% of the target population was assessed
by teacher questionnaires, only two thirds of these
children_s parents also completed questionnaires.
Comparing the 6,297 children having questionnaire
data from both informants with the 2,858 children
with teacher data only, the latter group had significantly
higher levels of teacher-reported psychopathology
(mean teacher SDQ total score 5.37 [SD 5.4] versus
4.13 [SD 4.8]; t = 10.56, df = 9,153, p < .001).
Allowing for this effect, there was no link between
parental nonparticipation and the gender or age of
the child.
A substantial number of parents invited to take part
in the second phase did not reply even though they
had participated in the first phase. This nonparticipa-
tion did not seem to be influenced by their child_s
level of psychopathology as judged by teacher and
parent questionnaires. Among the screen-positive
children whose parents were invited into the second
phase, mean parent SDQ total score was 10.9 (SD
6.1) for the 801 nonparticipants as compared with
11.3 (SD 6.2) for the 645 participants (t = 1.3, df =
144, p = .18). The corresponding mean teacher SDQ
scores were 9.6 (SD 6.7) and 9.2 (SD 6.3; t = 1.2, df =
144, p = .23). For the screen-negative children whose
parents were invited, mean parent SDQ total scores
were 4.2 (SD 3.0) for the 368 nonparticipants and 4.2
(SD 2.7) for the 364 participants (t = 0.1, df = 730,
p = .89). The corresponding mean teacher SDQ scores
were 2.6 (SD 2.5) and 2.4 (SD 2.6; t = 1.0, df = 730,
p = .31). There were also no significant differences
between participants and nonparticipants in age or
gender for either screen-positive or screen-negative
children.
Prevalence
Weighted prevalence estimates for the main diag-
nostic groups are presented separately for DSM-IV and
ICD-10 (Table 1). In two-phase studies, diagnostic
data from the second phase are weighted back to the
sample participating in the screening phase. In
Table 1, diagnostic data are weighted back to two
different samples: the Combined Questionnaire sample
and the Teacher Questionnaire sample. Weighting back
to the Combined Questionnaire sample is more akin to
the majority of two-phase studies, in which typically no
information on psychopathology is collected on the
children of nonparticipating parents. By contrast,
weighting back to the Teacher Questionnaire sample
allows for the fact that parental nonresponse is
associated with higher teacher-reported psychopatholo-
gy and hence generates higher prevalence rates (most
markedly for externalizing disorders). Given this
advantage, all further analyses were weighted back
to the Teacher Questionnaire sample. Thus, as shown
in Table 1, the final best estimate of the prevalence
of any DSM-IV psychiatric disorder is 7% for 8- to

10-year-olds in Bergen. Emotional disorders (anxiety
and depressive disorders) and behavior disorders
(oppositional and conduct disorders) were the most
common groups, followed by ADHD. The Bother
disorders[ category included autism spectrum, tic,
eating, and attachment disorders.
Comorbidity
The degree of overlap across two main diagnostic
groups adjusting for gender and association with the
third diagnostic group is illustrated in Figure 2. There
was a strong association between behavior disorders
and ADHD (odds ratio [OR] 75.1, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 32.3Y174.9; p < .001). The association
between behavior and emotional disorders was weaker
(OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.3Y16.0; p = .02), whereas there
was no statistically significant association between
ADHD and emotional disorders (OR 2.2, 95%
CI 0.5Y10.6; p = .5). Twenty-six percent had one or
more comorbid disorders, varying from 18% for
emotional disorders to 48% for behavior disorders
and 78% for ADHD.
Prevalence of specific DSM-IV disorders are pre-
sented in Table 2, although caution should be exercised
because of the wider confidence intervals when broken
down to this level.
Risk Factors
Preliminary analyses showed no significant associa-
tion between child mental disorders and maternal
education, once paternal education was allowed for.
Also, there was no association with physical disorders
once learning difficulties were allowed for. Therefore,
these variables are not presented here. Details from
unadjusted analyses are presented in Table 3.
All six variables shown in Table 3 were subsequently
entered into a multiple analysis (logistic regression).
Although age was nonsignificant in the simple analyses,
it was retained in the multiple analyses because of
opposing trends for increasing rates of behavior
disorders and decreasing rates of emotional disorders
and ADHD with age. Hence, there is the possibility
that age effects may become significant in an analysis
adjusting for comorbidity. Age, learning difficulties
(level of impairment), and parental education were
entered as continuous variables, whereas family type
and household income were dichotomized in line with

unadjusted findings, distinguishing traditional from
nontraditional families and defining poverty as the
lowest income band. No associations with paternal
education remained statistically significant, and this
variable was therefore removed, and the logistic
regression repeated. Because all of the remaining risk
factors were significantly associated with at least one
type of disorder, no further risk factors were dropped.
Details of the final adjusted analysis are shown in
Table 4. For behavior disorders, statistically significant
associations were found for male gender, learning
difficulties, and nontraditional family. Emotional
disorders were significantly associated with learning
difficulties and nontraditional family type. ADHD was
significantly associated with learning difficulties and
being younger.
Service Use
Table 5 shows the proportion of children for whom
parents reported contact (previous or current) with
services because of mental health problems.
The ADHD group includes children whose ADHD
was comorbid with emotional or behavior disorders.
The behavior disorder group includes children with
comorbid emotional disorders, but not children with
comorbid ADHD. The emotional disorders group did
not include children who also had ADHD or behavior
disorders. This hierarchical system ensured that the
ADHD, behavior disorders, and emotional disorders
rows in Table 5 were based on nonoverlapping groups
of children. Most children with ADHD had been in
contact with school psychology, special education, and
mental health services. Most children with behavior
disorders had been seen by the school psychology
service, but less than half by specialist mental health
services. Children with emotional disorders had less
often been in contact with services.
DISCUSSION
Overall Prevalence
This first Nordic large-scale survey of DSM-IV and
ICD-10 disorders in a child population suggests an
overall prevalence of mental disorders of about 7%.
Although this is at the lower end of the range com-
pared with studies from other parts of the world, it is
in no way unique. A prospective population survey
from North Carolina reported a prevalence of 6.8%
for DSM-IV disorders in 9- to 16-year-olds, when
Bsignificant functional impairment[ was required
for diagnosis (Costello et al., 2003). The correspond-
ing figure from a recent study in Puerto Rican 4- to
17-year-olds was 6.9% (Canino et al., 2004). How-
ever, for both of these studies, assessment methods
differed from those of the present study.
In the first study with the DAWBA (the British
survey from 1999), an overall prevalence of 9.5% in
5- to 15-year-olds was reported for both DSM-IV and
ICD-10 disorders (Ford et al., 2003; Meltzer et al.,
2000, 2003). For 8- to 10-year-olds (comparable to
the study reported here), a somewhat lower prevalence
of 8.6% was reported. Other surveys using the SDQ and
the DAWBA have mostly reported higher rates; 12.7%
for 7- to 14-year-olds in Taubate, Brazil (Fleitlich-Bilyk
and Goodman, 2004), 15.2% for 5- to 10-year-olds in
Dhaka, Bangladesh (Mullick and Goodman, 2005),
and 15.3% for 7- to 14-year-olds in Novosibirsk, Russia
(Goodman et al., 2005b). An exception was a study of
a rural island community in northeast Brazil, where

here too, screening and diagnostic measures differed
from those used in the present study, and the study had
a low response rate for the screening phase (51%).
A number of factors may have contributed to the
relatively low overall rate for DSM-IV and ICD-10
disorders reported here. First, the diagnostic procedure
used in the DAWBA allows the use of open-ended
questions and transcripts to assess whether the
respondent has understood the questions and whether
the severity seems to indicate a need for clinical
intervention. Each problem section also incorporates a
structured assessment of domain-specific impact on
everyday functioning. The range of disorders covered
by the DAWBA is somewhat limited compared with
some other measures and does not specifically address
elimination, somatization, psychotic, or substance
abuse disorders. It is possible that the use of other
methods for diagnosis, such as child interview or direct
observation procedures, may have produced higher
prevalence rates.
Second, the age range included here was limited to
8- to 10-year-olds, who probably represent a group
with a lower rate of disorders than in the adolescent
period (Canino et al., 2004; Costello et al., 2003; Ford
et al., 2003). For specific disorders, however, the
interaction with age is more complex; ADHD, specific
phobia, and separation anxiety are more common
before than during adolescence, whereas depression,
social phobia, panic disorder, psychotic disorders,
eating disorders, and substance abuse become more
common in adolescence. Future waves of the study will
address the offset and onset of specific disorders for
this cohort.
Third, the relatively low prevalence reported here
could also reflect less poverty and social stratification in
the Nordic countries compared with other economic
and political systems. An association with socio-
economic factors was evident for emotional and
behavior disorders, which were the most common
groups in this as in many previous surveys. Although
an effect of income remained in the adjusted analyses,
this was restricted to the lowest income band
representing only 7% of the sample. A higher poverty
rate and greater social inequality in other countries may
have contributed to higher rates of disorders in other
studies (Fleitlich-Bilyk and Goodman, 2004; Mullick
and Goodman, 2005). However, it is also conceivable
that a lower prevalence may reflect genetic differences
between populations.
Type of Disorder and Comorbidity
The overall pattern of disorders was similar to other
recent surveys focusing on child and adolescent mental
health. Emotional and behavior disorders were the most
frequent, followed by ADHD/hyperkinetic disorder
(Canino et al., 2004; Costello et al., 2003; Fleitlich-
Bilyk and Goodman, 2004; Ford et al., 2003). There
was overall a close correspondence between DSM-IV
and ICD-10 rates of disorders.
The reported prevalence of 1.7% for ADHD is low
compared with most previous studies; however, the
other two recent large-scale DSM-IV population
surveys also report more conservative prevalence
estimates. The total ADHD prevalence was 2.5% for
8- to 10-year-olds in the British national survey (Ford
et al., 2003) and 2.2% for 9- to 10-year-olds in a U.S.-
based survey (Costello et al., 2003). These lower
prevalence estimates cannot be explained only by the
diagnostic instruments because these differ across the
studies mentioned here. Rather, impairment criteria

included in recent versions of the diagnostic classifica-
tions may be of importance, especially when evaluated
from the respondent_s examples from everyday life.
Clearly, the possibility of ADHD being less prevalent
than previously believed is important to address in
future surveys because treatments offered show great
variations between countries and clearly involve risks as
well as benefits to children.
An overall comorbidity rate of 29% is also very much
in line with recent reports in youths, ranging from 24%
to 29% (Costello et al., 2003; Fleitlich-Bilyk and
Goodman, 2004; Ford et al., 2003). However, as
shown here, comorbidity rates differ markedly between
disorders (ranging from 18% to 78%).
The striking association between ADHD and
behavior disorders and the lack of association between
ADHD and emotional disorders corresponds to other
surveys in which the association with the third group of
disorders was properly controlled for in the analysis
(Costello et al., 2003; Fleitlich-Bilyk and Goodman,
2004; Ford et al., 2003).
Risk Factors
The observed associations with male gender and
learning disabilities have been confirmed in other recent
surveys of child mental disorders across different
economic and cultural settings (Canino et al., 2004;
Costello et al., 2003; Ford et al., 2003; Goodman et al.,
2005b). In spite of the narrow age range in this first
wave of the study, mental disorders were associated with
being younger, primarily resulting from an association
between ADHD and younger age. Emotional and
behavior disorders showed associations with family
type, suggesting that these disorders may be influenced
more by social factors than is ADHD. Similar findings
were reported also in the British 1999 survey (Ford
et al., 2003). However, because of the cross-sectional
design of these studies, causality cannot be inferred, and
correlates may therefore best be used to identify risk
groups toward whom prevention and early intervention
for mental disorders may be targeted. We hope to
expand the assessment of risk and protective factors in
future waves of this longitudinal study.
Service Use
Most children with behavior disorders and ADHD
had been in contact with school services. Although
most children with ADHD also had been in contact
with specialist services, this was rarely the case for
children with pure emotional disorders. This could
reflect a milder nature of emotional disorders, but
also the fact that internalizing problems are less
disruptive and less likely to come to the attention of
parents and teachers. These findings are in line with
the adult literature in which a particularly long delay
between onset and treatment has been demonstrated
for emotional disorders (Wang et al., 2005). This
may indicate a need for a more integrated system for
detection and effective treatment for emotional
disorders in particular.
Limitations
The considerable attrition at the interview phase
could be seen to be a major drawback of the study.
However, through regression analysis, we were able to
adjust for differences in reported problem levels between
participant and nonparticipants. We therefore believe
that the sizable attrition at this phase has not rendered
the current data unreliable or unrepresentative.
Although this study was not designed to be nationally
representative, a comparison of questionnaire data with
the SDQ from other regions of Norway, as well as other
Nordic countries, showed similar levels of emotional
and behavioral problems reported by teachers, parents,
and youths (Obel et al., 2004). This may reflect the
relative uniformity (cultural, economic, and political)
within and between the Nordic countries. Thus, it is
likely that our prevalence rates are relatively representa-
tive for Norway as well as for the Nordic countries in
general.
Clinical Implications
The relatively low prevalence of child mental
disorders reported here may reflect less social inequality
in Norway than in many other countries. Risk factors
vary between disorders, and family factors were
especially important for emotional and conduct dis-
orders. The pattern of disorders and comorbidity was
similar to what has been reported from other countries.
Service use differed strikingly across disorders. Many
children with ADHD but few with pure emotional
disorders had been referred to specialist mental health
services. Based on the presented findings, it seems to be
an important goal to increase the availability of effective
detection and interventions for emotional problems in
school-age children.

Objective: Our objective with this study was to identify the nature and the role of spirituality from the parents_ perspective at
the end of life in the PICU and to discern clinical implications. Methods: A qualitative study based on parental responses to
open-ended questions on anonymous, self-administered questionnaires was conducted at 3 PICUs in Boston, Massachusetts.
Fifty-six parents whose children had died in PICUs after the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies participated. Results:
Overall, spiritual/religious themes were included in the responses of 73% (41 of 56) of parents to questions about what had been
most helpful to them and what advice they would offer to others at the end of life. Four explicitly spiritual/religious themes
emerged: prayer, faith, access to and care from clergy, and belief in the transcendent quality of the parent-child relationship that
endures beyond death. Parents also identified several implicitly spiritual/religious themes, including insight and wisdom; reliance
on values; and virtues such as hope, trust, and love. Conclusions: Many parents drew on and relied on their spirituality to guide
them in end-of-life decision-making, to make meaning of the loss, and to sustain them emotionally. Despite the dominance of
technology and medical discourse in the ICU, many parents experienced their child_s end of life as a spiritual journey. Staff
members, hospital chaplains, and community clergy are encouraged to be explicit in their hospitality to parents_ spirituality and
religious faith, to foster a culture of acceptance and integration of spiritual perspectives, and to work collaboratively to deliver
spiritual care. Pediatrics 2006;118:e719Ye729.
