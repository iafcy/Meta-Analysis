health programs in similar communities 
(St. Louis, Buffalo, and New Orleans). The consol- 
idated services are specifically designed to offer a 
full range of mental and physical health services to 
adolescents. In contrast, the traditional health ser- 
vices provide care based on medical needs such as 
gynecology, pediatrics, and dentistry, and provide 
care for all age ranges from child to adult. 
The two-wave design will allow evaluation of the 
clinics’ awareness and treatment 
of the problems 
reported by adolescents in the first wave, and of the 
impact of these different types of health services on 
their parents’ mental and physical 
th in the sec- 
ond wave. This paper, based on data from the first 
wave, reports patterns of health problems and help

The adolescents participating were selected for in- 
terviews by the research team in the order that they 
presented to the clinics for care. The adolescents 
understood 
that these interviews were totally in- 
dependent of their health care. Whenever possible, 
interviews were completed on site immediately be- 
fore or after a clinic visit. Otherwise, an appointment 
for a future interview was arranged. Postponed in- 
terviews were usually completed within a few days 
of the clinic visit either on site or at a location mu- 
tually convenient for i

was made to stratify by age. The clinic patients were 
predominantly 
female (77%), black (70%), and age 
15 years or older (35%) (Table 1). Only 3.6% of the 
adolescents selected for interviews refused to par- 
ticipate; no reasons were specified.

The modified version of the DIS used for our study 
allows lifetime and current 
diagnoses 
of major 
depression, 
dysthymia, 
and drug and/or 
alcohol 
abuse and dependence. 
The DIS depression section 
also provides information about swicide ideation and 
behavior. Youths whom we consider suicide idea- 
tors had one or more of the following symptoms: 
frequent thoughts 
of death, 2 weeks or more of 
wanting to die, thiig 
of committing 
suicide, or 
a history of attempting 
suicide. 
The diagnosis of conduct disorder is based on 
questions from the Diagnostic Interview for Chil- 
dren and Adolescents (DICA). The DICA is a struc- 
tured 
interview 
protocol 
designed 
to diagnose 
psychiatric disorders occurring in individuals under 
the age of 18 years according to DSM-III criteria.

clustered together in time duri;\g the last year. Yet 
less than half of these patients sought or received 
help for their depression. 
Suicide Iderotion and Be/&&r. tithough 
there is an 
association between 
depression 
and suicide, the 
overlap is far from complete. Many depressed ad- 
olescents are not suicidal, and some, suicidal ado- 
lescents do not have symptoms 
of depression. 
Of 
youths who reported suicide idea- 
tion, only i$% met the criteria for a diagnosis of 
major depression. 
One fourth of all patients reported 
having had 
suicide thoughts or behaviors within the last year. 
Nevertheless, 
the treatment gap was substantial as 
only one third of the patients with suicide ideation 
or behavior had sought help during the year. 
Conducr L&r&r. 
Eleven percent of the patients 
met criteria for a DSM-ILI diagnosis of a conduct 
disorder within the last year. Nevertheless, 
only 
26% of those conduct-disordered 
youths sought or 
received help for their behavior problems. Thus, less 
than one in three of the patients displaying behav- 
iors directly related to high community rates of mor- 
bidity and mortality received an intervention 
for 
those behaviors. 
Substance Abuse or Dependency. Much of the mor- 
bidity and mortality 
in inner-city 
communities 
may be associated with high rates of alcohol or 
drug abuse and dependence. 
Although 
there was 
a heavy use of alcohol and drugs (Table 2) in our 
population, 
the number of patients 
with alcohol 
or drug abuse or dependence 
(by DSM-III diag- 
nostic criteria) tias too low for separate analyses. 
The overlap was considerable. 
Only 61 youths 
had a diagnosis of alcohol abuti 
or dependence, 
and only 11 had a diagnosis of substance abuse or 
dependence. 
Therefore, the youths with a diagno- 
sis of alcdhol abuse/dependence 
and illicit drug 
abuse/dependence 
were combined. 
Six percent of 
the patients had substance abuse behavior in the 
year, but only one in five sought or received help 
for their substana: &use. 
The problems that we have singled out for discus- 
sion are important because they put youth at a high 
risk for death. Depression and suicide ideas increase 
the risk for suicide; conduct disorder and substance 
abuse increase the risk for homicide and accidental 
death. 
These causes claim many more lives of 
yomgsters 
than do physical illness or unwanted 
pregnancy. It seems clear that the health clinics have 
the opportunity 
to provide help for these problems 
because the frequency is high among theu patients. 
However, our findings suggest that high-risk ado- 
lescents typically do not seek help for these prob- 
lems. The highest rate of help seeking occurred for 
the physical care needs of sexually active females, 
as securing a contraceptive, 
but even then it 
ot exceed tie thirds. Thus, even in the current 
national climate in which considerable attention is 
being given to the prevention 
of adolescent 
preg- 
nancy, a substantial number of sexually active girls 
who are in contact with a medical clinic are not ask- 
ing for or being offered contraceptive 
help. Al- 
though considerable variation in help seeking for the 
other four mental health conditions was found, in 
each case less ?han half of those identified by the 
interview as having a high-risk condition sought or 
received help. The rates of care for suicide ideation, 
conduct disorder, and substance abuse were partic- 
ularly low, with less than a third of those youths 
identified by the research interview as having the 
problem seeking or receiving help. 
These less than satisfactory rates of help seeking 
are important, 
given that the sample youths had 
already elected to visit a clinic for some type of help, 
and at least some of them had had multiple clinic 
contacts. This finding suggests that, during intake 
procedures with adolescents, 
clinic staff may need 
to increase the amount of probing or questioning, 
particularly in the area of mental health problems, 
which adolescents tend to perceive as inappropriate 
oroblems to discuss with health care professionals 
m this setting. It can be reasonably assumed that 
nonpatients, 
or nonclinic attenders, may have even 
lower rates of help seeking. The relatively low pro- 
portion of help seekers suggests that much work is 
still needed in the arta of outreach to youths not 
using health services, as well as to youths who are 
using health clinics but are not seeking care for the 
types of conditions 
we examined. 
The predomi- 
nance of females at our clinics further illustrates that 
a major problem exists in attracting at-risk males.
