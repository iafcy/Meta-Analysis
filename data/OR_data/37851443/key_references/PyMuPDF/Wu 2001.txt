ational studies have indicated
increasing rates of depression
and a shift to a younger age of
onset (1–4). Depression is one of the
leading risk factors for suicide among
children and adolescents (5,6). 
The Epidemiologic Catchment
Area study (7) found that about one-
third of adults who suffered from a
major depressive disorder had not
sought treatment. In a review of stud-
ies of adult depression, Hirshfeld and
associates (8) found serious under-
treatment of persons with depression,
even though effective treatments
have been available for several
decades. They concluded that pa-
tient-associated reasons for under-
treatment include failure to recognize
symptoms, limited access to services,
lack of insurance, fear of being stig-
matized, and noncompliance with
treatment. A further conclusion was
that inadequate training of health
care providers and barriers created by
mental health care delivery systems
also contribute to undertreatment.
The cost to individuals, families, and
society of undertreatment is substan-
tial (8–10).
The situation of children who need
mental health services is no different
from that of adults: many children re-
ceive inappropriate services (11) or
no services at all (12–14). Children
with depressive disorders are less

Objective: This study examined patterns of mental health service use
among depressed children and adolescents and factors associated with
help seeking and treatment modalities. Methods: The sample consist-
ed of 206 children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years who were as-
sessed as part of a larger survey of mental health service use in five
service systems and in the community and who met DSM-III-R criteria
for depressive disorders (major depression or dysthymia). Results:
Among the 206 children, 75 (36 percent) never received professional
help for depressive symptoms. Among the 131 children who received
professional help for depression, antidepressants were prescribed for
40 (31 percent) in the year before the interview. The findings indicate
possible undertreatment of depression among children and adoles-
cents, especially among African Americans. Socioeconomic factors,
such as the mother’s education and the child’s health insurance, were
not associated with receiving professional help for depressive symp-
toms but were associated with receiving antidepressants. Parental per-
ception of a child’s mental health service need was associated with re-
ceiving professional help but not with receiving antidepressants. Also,
depressed children were more likely to receive antidepressants when
they had life-threatening or severe symptoms, such as a suicide at-
tempt or drug abuse. Conclusions: Whether a depressed child receives
mental health services and the types of treatment received are influ-
enced by different individual and family factors and by the type of
symptoms exhibited. Better understanding of these factors will help in
meeting the service needs of depressed children and adolescents.

likely to receive mental health servic-
es than children with disruptive disor-
ders (15–17). 
Individual characteristics found to
affect child mental health service uti-
lization include the child’s age (18–
20), gender (18,20–22), ethnicity (19–
21,23), physical illness (24), and level
of functioning (17,25,26). Family
characteristics include socioeconomic
status (19,22,24) and the parents’ use
of mental health services (22), their
perception of the child’s need for
mental health services and whether
the need was met (17), and their per-
ceived burden (27). All these factors,
with the exception of perceived
parental burden, were taken into ac-
count in this study.
Most studies of child and adoles-
cent mental health service need and
service use have not examined the as-
sociation between service use and
specific psychiatric disorders. Little
is known about the factors that affect
mental health service use for depres-
sion or the types of treatment re-
ceived by children with depression.
In this context, our study addressed
three questions: What are the factors
associated with receiving profession-
al help for childhood depression?
What are the factors associated with
receiving antidepressants for depres-
sion? Are there shared and unique
factors associated with receiving pro-
fessional help and receiving antide-
pressants? 
Methods
Sample and data 
Our analysis used data from a group
of 206 children and adolescents aged
9 to 17 years who met DSM-III-R cri-
teria for depressive disorders (major
depression or dysthymic disorder).
This group is a subsample of a survey
of mental health service need and
service utilization among children
and adolescents from nonresidential
child service systems and the commu-
nity in Westchester County, New
York (28). The group comprises all
the subjects in the Westchester study
who met criteria for depressive disor-
ders. 
The Westchester study included
763 children and adolescents ran-
domly selected from five child serv-
ice systems: mental health, substance
use, child welfare, special education,
and probation. The study also includ-
ed 533 children and adolescents re-
cruited from the community, includ-
ing 360 children from the Westch-
ester site of the Methods for the Epi-
demiology of Child and Adolescent
Mental Disorders (MECA) study by
the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH) (29–32), selected
from the same sampling frame and
assessed with identical measures of
child psychopathology, impairment,
and service use. 
The child and one parent or
guardian in each household were in-
terviewed for approximately three
hours by trained interviewers about
childhood psychopathology, mental
health service use, and a wide array
of risk factors (29,32). 
Measures of psychopathology 
and impairment
Depression and other mental dis-
orders. Children’s depression and
other mental disorders in the six
months preceding the interview were
assessed by the NIMH Diagnostic In-
terview Schedule for Children (DISC)
(DSM-III-R) or DISC 2.3 (30). The
validity and reliability of the measures
have 
been 
reported 
elsewhere
(30–31). A diagnostic criterion was
considered to be positive if reported
by either the parent or the child (30).
Depressive disorders included major
depression and dysthymia. The num-
ber of depressive symptoms was also
included in the analysis as an indica-
tor of severity. Other mental disor-
ders included anxiety disorders, dis-
ruptive disorders, and substance use
disorders.
Impairment.
Impairment was
measured by the Child Global Assess-
ment Scale (CGAS). The CGAS
scores range from 1 to 100, with a
lower score representing greater im-
pairment. The interviewer’s rating,
based on the parent interview with
satisfactory validity, was used (25).
Service use and perceived need
Child mental health service use
for depression. Specific questions
about service use for depression, in-
cluding treatment and medications
received, were asked for children
who met the NIMH-DISC criteria
for depression (30). As with the DISC
diagnoses, treatment information
from the parent and the child was ag-
gregated. In addition, in the non-
DISC service use section, the parent
and child were asked about the child’s
treatments and medications for emo-
tional, behavioral, and drug prob-
lems. We used two variables in our
analysis: whether the child had ever
been seen by a health professional—
psychiatrist, psychologist, physician,
social worker, or guidance counselor
—for depressive symptoms, and
whether the child used an antidepres-
sant in the previous year.
Parental perception of a child’s
service needs and unmet needs.
Parents were asked if they believed
their children needed any mental
health service (perceived need) and
whether any had been received. A
perception of unmet need was
recorded if a parent reported that a
child’s need for services was not met.
This measure is imprecise, however,
because a child could have been re-
ceiving services but the parent may
still have believed that the need had
not been met.
Maternal mental health service
use. We used two variables in the
parent interview: whether the bio-

services at 
all.

logical mother had ever been seen by
any mental health professional for a
psychological or emotional problem,
and whether the biological mother
ever took any medication for a psy-
chological or emotional problem. 
Sociodemographic factors 
Data on each child’s gender, age, race
or ethnicity, household income, ma-
ternal education, and health insur-
ance status were used in the analyses.
Health insurance status was classified
as no insurance, Medicaid, or private
insurance (which included all non-
Medicaid health insurance). 
Analysis
We were mainly interested in two bi-
nary dependent variables: whether
the depressed children had received
professional help for depression, and
whether those who received profes-
sional help received antidepressants.
A univariate analysis was first con-
ducted to compare sociodemographic
characteristics, other psychiatric dis-
orders, and other factors of depressed
children who received professional
help with those who never received
any professional help for depression.
Among those who received profes-
sional help, univariate analysis was
used to compare those who received
antidepressants with those who did
not. A chi square test was used for
categorical variables, and a t test was
used for continuous variables. 
Multiple logistic regression analysis
was used to identify factors that af-
fected mental health service use for
depression among all depressed chil-
dren. For those who received help,
the same method was used to identify
the factors differentiating those who
were taking antidepressants from
those who were not.
The two dependent variables—re-
ceipt of professional help and receipt
of antidepressants—correspond to
the two dichotomies of the service
use hierarchy; the comparison for an-
tidepressant treatment was nested
within the comparison for getting
professional help. Therefore, in the
last stage of our analysis, we used a
nested response model (33) to exam-
ine whether the factors affecting re-
ceipt of professional help for depres-
sion were the same as those affecting
receipt of antidepressants. The mod-
el was tested using the SAS general-
ized linear models (GENMOD) pro-
cedure (34).
Results
Sample description
Of the 206 depressed children and
adolescents, 116 (56 percent) were
girls, 82 (40 percent) were white, 71
(35 percent) were African American,
38 (18 percent) were Hispanic, and
15 (7 percent) were other. The mean
age±SD was 14.4±2.3 years. Thirty-
nine children in the community sam-
ple (7.3 percent) and 167 children in
the child service systems sample (21.9
percent) were depressed. 
Comparisons of demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics of de-
pressed children from the communi-
ty with those from the service systems
show that depressed children from
the service systems were more likely
to be boys, to be ethnic minorities, to
be from disadvantaged families with a
low income, and to be on Medicaid
(data not shown). These notable dif-
ferences between the children from
the community and those from serv-
ice systems were anticipated. In the
subsequent multivariate analyses, a
dummy variable—services versus
community—was included to control
for differences in the community and
service systems samples.
Univariate analyses
Of the 206 depressed children, 131
(64 percent) received professional
help; 75 (36 percent) did not seek
professional help for depressive
symptoms. Table 1 shows the family
and individual characteristics of de-
pressed children who received pro-
fessional help compared with those
who did not. African-American
youth were less likely to receive pro-
fessional help than those from other
ethnic groups. As expected, de-
pressed children who received pro-
fessional help were more likely to
have a greater number of depressive
symptoms and more impairment
than those who did not receive such
help. Mothers of depressed children
who received professional help re-
ported greater use of mental health
services and medication for their
own psychiatric problems and were
more likely to think that their chil-
dren needed mental health services
than mothers of depressed children
who did not receive help. 
Among the 131 children who re-
ceived professional help, antidepres-
sants were prescribed for 40 (31 per-
cent) in the year before the inter-
view. As Table 1 shows, children who
received antidepressants were signif-
icantly more likely than children who
did not to be white, to have a moth-
er who had received professional
help and antidepressants, and to be
more impaired. Families of children
who received antidepressants also
had a higher average income and a
higher level of maternal education
and were more likely to have private
insurance. Children who received
antidepressants were also more like-
ly to meet criteria for substance
abuse disorders and to have recently
attempted suicide.
Multivariate Analyses
Table 2 shows the results of two logis-
tic regression analyses. Because the
results shown in Table 1 indicated
that the major ethnic difference was

er ethnic groups, African Americans
were compared with all other ethnic
groups in the logistic regression
analysis. Table 2 shows the adjusted
odds ratios and confidence intervals
for the analysis comparing depressed
children who received professional
help with those who never received
any help and for the analysis compar-
ing those who received antidepres-
sants with those who did not.
As shown in Table 2, children who
received professional help for depres-
sion were significantly less likely to be
African American, had more depres-
sive symptoms, and were more im-
paired. Their parents were also more
likely to report that the child needed
mental health services and were less
likely to report unmet need. Girls
tended to receive professional help
more often than boys, and children
with disruptive disorders were less
likely than other depressed children
to receive treatment for depression.

fessional help, factors significantly as-

sociated with receiving antidepres-
sants included being male, a higher
level of maternal education, comor-
bid substance use disorders, a recent
suicide attempt, and greater impair-
ment. Children from families with
private health insurance tended to re-
ceive antidepressants more often
than those from families with no in-
surance.
As discussed above, we were inter-
ested in identifying factors that af-
fected whether children received
professional help for depression and
that influenced whether antidepres-
sant medication was prescribed for
those who received help. In addition,
we wanted to identify shared and
unique factors associated with receiv-
ing professional help and antidepres-
sants. Because the comparison of
children who received antidepres-
sants was nested within the compari-
son of children who received profes-
sional help, the model of nested re-
sponses (33) was applied to the data. 
We identified four factors with dif-
ferential impact on the receipt of pro-
fessional help for childhood depres-
sion compared with the use of antide-
pressants among those receiving pro-
fessional help. Girls were more likely
to receive professional help for de-
pression; however, among all those
who received help, boys were more
likely to receive antidepressants
(p<.01). Also, the mother’s education
and the child’s comorbid substance
use disorders and previous suicide at-
tempt were significantly related to
antidepressant treatment (p<.05) but
not to receiving professional help for
depression. 
Discussion and conclusions
Most studies of child mental health
service use have not examined service
use in terms of a specific disorder.
The study reported here assessed
child mental health service use for
depression and compared factors af-
fecting the use of professional help
and treatment with antidepressants
for childhood depression. 
Consistent with findings of studies
of adults (7,8), depression appears to
be undertreated among children and
adolescents, especially among African
Americans (21,35,36). However, it
has been suggested that African-
American youth more frequently seek
help for psychological symptoms
from nonprofessional domains such
as church and family before seeking
formal mental health services than do
whites (37). Further research in this
area is needed.
After the analysis controlled for
other possible confounding factors,
depressed girls appeared to be some-
what more likely to receive profes-
sional help for depression than boys.
This gender difference is consistent
with that found among adults (38,39).
However, among children who re-

ceived professional help for depres-
sion, boys were more likely to receive
antidepressants. These findings sug-
gest that the gender effect may differ
by types of service and treatment.
More studies are needed to replicate
these findings. 
Family socioeconomic characteris-
tics did not appear to be significant
factors in whether children received
professional help, but they did play an
important role in whether antidepres-
sants were prescribed. Children who
received antidepressants were more
likely to come from families of higher
socioeconomic status. Although the
association with income disappeared
in the multivariate analyses, the
mother’s education remained a signif-
icant predictor, suggesting that pa-
rental knowledge of depression and
of available medications for treat-
ment may influence the type of serv-
ices received.
Like other studies (40,41), our find-
ings did not show a correlation be-
tween having insurance and receiving
professional help for depression.
However, among children receiving
such help, those with private insur-
ance tended to be somewhat more
likely to receive antidepressants than
those with no insurance. These find-
ings suggest that studies examining
mental health service use without si-
multaneously exploring the type of
treatment received may not reveal—
and may consequently underesti-
mate—the impact of having health
insurance. The impact of insurance
on different types of treatment for
depression and possibly other disor-
ders should be explored.
Consistent with previous studies
(26,40), our results indicate that level
of impairment and severity of depres-
sion (number of depressive symp-
toms) were related to receiving men-
tal health services. The occurrence of
other disorders did not appear to be
related to a child’s receiving profes-
sional help for depression. However,
among children who received such
help, those who received antidepres-
sants were more likely to have a co-
morbid substance use disorder and
to have had a previous suicide at-
tempt. This finding is consistent with
previous studies (1) and suggests
that children with depression are
more likely to receive antidepres-
sants if they have some life-threaten-
ing or severe symptoms, such as a
suicide attempt and drug abuse.
In summary, our findings suggest
that parental failure to recognize de-
pressive symptoms, lack of knowl-
edge about depression and its related
treatment, and lack of adequate health
insurance may all influence whether
or not a child receives services as well
as the type of treatment received.
Mental health education should be
offered to parents to improve early
identification and treatment of de-
pressed children and adolescents.
A limitation of this study is that the
information on treatment for depres-
sion was limited, as we did not have a
measure of psychotherapy. Conse-
quently, the children who did not re-
ceive antidepressant treatment could
have received anything from a single
evaluation to a full range of treatment
without antidepressants. It is also
possible that some depressed chil-
dren who received antidepressants
had previously received another type
of treatment. Therefore, we do not
mean to imply that children who re-
ceived antidepressants got better
service than those who did not. 
In fact, the literature indicates that
although both psychotherapy and
pharmacotherapy have been found to
be beneficial for depressive disorders,
children do not seem to respond to
antidepressants as well as adults do
(1,42–45). Psychotherapy has been
recommended as the first treatment
for most depressed youth, with anti-
depressants considered only for those
with more severe depression, bipolar
disorder, and depression with psy-
chotic features and those who do not
respond to psychotherapeutic inter-
vention (1). Future research, includ-
ing detailed treatment information, is
needed. 
Finally, because of the low preva-
lence of depression, data from our
community and service systems sam-
ples were combined to increase the
power of the analysis. Although sam-
ple differences were statistically con-
trolled and detailed analyses were
conducted to ensure that our findings
were not due to sample differences, a
large-scale study is needed to repli-
cate these findings. o
