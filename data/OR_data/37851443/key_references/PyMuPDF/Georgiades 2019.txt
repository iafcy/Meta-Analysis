Abstract
Objectives: To present the 6-month prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of mental disorders and mental health–
related service contacts in a sample of children (4 to 11 years) and youth (12 to 17 years) in Ontario.
Methods: The 2014 Ontario Child Health Study is a provincially representative survey of 6537 families with children aged 4 to
17 years in Ontario. DSM-IV-TR mental disorders were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for
Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID) and included mood (major depressive episode), anxiety (generalized anxiety, separation
anxiety, social phobia, specific phobia), and behaviour disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional-defiant
disorder, conduct disorder).The MINI-KID was administered independently to the primary caregiver and youth aged 12 to
17 years in the family’s home.

Results: Past 6-month prevalence of any mental disorder ranged from 18.2% to 21.8% depending on age and informant.
Behaviour disorders were the most common among children, and anxiety disorders were the most common among youth.
Among children and youth with a parent-identified mental disorder, 25.6% of children and 33.7% of youth had contact with a
mental health provider. However, 60% had contact with one or more of the providers or service settings assessed, most often
through schools.
Conclusions: Between 18% and 22% of children and youth in Ontario met criteria for a mental disorder but less than one-
third had contact with a mental health provider. These findings provide support for strengthening prevention and early
intervention efforts and enhancing service capacity to meet the mental health needs of children and youth in Ontario.

Introduction
Epidemiological studies of mental disorders among children
and youth provide evidence on the level of disorder in the
general population, its geographic distribution, and socio-
demographic correlates and rates of mental health–related
service contacts. This evidence can inform policy and pro-
gram priorities for allocating resources to: children most at
risk for experiencing mental disorder and/or service gaps,
geographic areas, and service providers responsible for
addressing mental health need in the community. In Canada,
epidemiological studies explicitly designed to generate evi-
dence on the prevalence and correlates of child and youth
mental disorders and service contacts in the general popula-
tion are limited to the 1983 Ontario Child Health Study
(OCHS)1 and 2 Quebec surveys conducted in the 1990s.2,3
The 2014 OCHS—a sequel to the 1983 OCHS—was
designed to address current evidence gaps.
A review of surveys conducted in populations compara-
ble to Canadian children and youth4 estimated the pooled
prevalence of 1 or more mental disorders to be 14.3%,
similar in magnitude to the worldwide estimate of 13.4%
reported in a meta-analysis of 41 prevalence studies.5 Impor-
tant patterns in the distribution of child and youth mental
disorders have also been documented. For example, disrup-
tive behaviour disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder are more common among boys compared to girls,
while mood and anxiety disorders are more common among
adolescent girls.1,2,4,6,7 Consistent differences in prevalence
by family socioeconomic circumstances and composition,
immigrant background, and urbanicity have also been docu-
mented.1,6,8-13 The 1983 OCHS reported higher prevalence
of disorder among children and youth living in urban versus
rural areas,1 lone- versus 2-parent families,13 and households
with low versus middle and high income.11 In contrast, the
1983 OCHS reported similar prevalence of mental disorder
between immigrant (i.e., foreign-born) and nonimmigrant
(i.e., Canadian-born) children and youth.14 Subsequent stud-
ies, however, in the United States9,10 and Canada,8 have
consistently documented lower levels of mental disorder
among children and youth from immigrant backgrounds.

Population-level evidence on the association between
child and youth mental disorder and use of mental health
services is very limited in Canada. The 1983 OCHS esti-
mated that only 1 in 6 children and youth with a mental
disorder received mental health or social services in the
6 months preceding the study.1 Higher maternal education
was positively associated with accessing mental health and
social services,15 while immigrant background was nega-
tively associated.14 Evidence from population-based studies
in the United States consistently reveals underutilization of
mental health services among females compared to males,
younger children compared to adolescents, and those from
ethnic minority and immigrant backgrounds.10,12,16-19 In
contrast, living with 1 or no biological parent, compared to
2, has been positively associated with mental health service
use.16,20 Studies examining other socioeconomic and demo-
graphic correlates of service use, such as family poverty, par-
ental education, and urbanicity, have been less consistent and
generallyrevealfew ornodifferences.1,16-18,20,21Datafromthe
United States also indicate that school and speciality mental
health settings are the most common sectors providing child
mental health services, followed by general medical set-
tings.18,22 Admittedly, the unique demographic composition
of Canadian society and its health care system raise questions
about the applicability of health services research findings
from the United States to the Canadian context.
The objectives of this study were to present the
6-month prevalence estimates and sociodemographic
correlates of mental disorders and mental health–related
service contacts among children (4 to 11 years) and youth
(12 to 17 years) in Ontario.
Methods
The 2014 OCHS is a province-wide, cross-sectional, epide-
miologic study of child and youth health and mental disor-
der. A probability sample of 6537 households (50.8%
response) with 10,802 children aged 4 to 17 years partici-
pated. The sampling frame was the 2014 Canadian Child Tax
Benefit file. Households were selected based on a 3-stage
survey design that involved cluster sampling of residential
areas and stratification by residency (urban, rural) and
income (areas and households cross-classified by 3 levels
of income: <20th, 20th to 80th, and >80th percentiles). In
families with 2 or more eligible children, 1 was selected
randomly to serve as the “selected child” (SC) for all
assessments, and up to 3 remaining children 4 to 17 years
old in the household were included in a subset of assess-
ments. Data were collected in the home by trained Statistics
Canada interviewers from the person most knowledgeable
about all children (98.6% identified as parent of SC and
therefore hereafter referred to as parent) and from youth
aged 12 to 17 years. Data collection occurred from October
2014 to October 2015. Detailed accounts of the survey
design, content, training, and data collection are available
elsewhere.23,24
Measures
Diagnostic interview. A modified version of the Mini Interna-
tional Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adoles-
cents (MINI-KID), a fully structured diagnostic interview,
was administered by trained lay interviewers to the parent
about the SC (MINI-KID-P) and separately to youth (12 to
17 years) (MINI-KID).25,26 Modifications included: 1) the
selection of a subset of the most commonly occurring mental
disorders in children and youth; 2) an exclusive focus on past
6-month occurrence for all assessed disorders, with the
exception of conduct disorder, which was assessed for the
past 12 months, with at least 1 criterion present in the past
6 months; 3) adaptations to skip patterns to allow for the
assessment of subthreshold conditions; and 4) the inclusion
of distress or impairment criteria for the classification of
each disorder. All modifications and translations into
Canadian-French were approved by the developers of the
MINI-KID.
Training of Statistics Canada interviewers on the admin-
istration of the MINI-KID included in-depth review of an
interviewer manual and training videos with example inter-
views and practice assessments. Disorder classifications
derived from the MINI-KID demonstrate adequate test-
retest reliability across disorders, informants, and samples,
as well as convergent and discriminant validity.25,26
DSM-IV-TR disorders assessed include mood disorder
(major depressive episode), anxiety disorders (generalized
anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia, specific phobia),
and behaviour disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis-
order, oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disorder). Chil-
dren and youth who met criteria for at least 1 disorder were
classified with any disorder. Classification of disorder was
established separately for parent and youth (12 to 17 years),
given low to moderate agreement between parent and youth
reports of mental disorders27,28 and informant-specific pat-
terns of associated features of disorder.29,30 In the present
study, parent-youth agreement of disorder classification was
low, with k estimates ranging from 0.21 for social phobia to
0.38 for separation anxiety (see online supplemental table).
Service contact. Mental health–related service contact was
assessed using questions administered to the parent about
provider type and service setting. Provider type was assessed
by asking the parent whether the SC had seen or talked to a
medical doctor or other professional about mental health
concerns in the past 6 months. Types of providers were
aggregated to include general health care providers (family
doctor, pediatrician, other regular health care provider, other
type of physician or specialist, nurse, other health profes-
sional), mental health providers (psychiatrist, psychologist,
social worker, other type of counsellor), and a combination
of complementary/alternative medicine providers (religious
or spiritual leader, alternative healers such as a naturopath or
herbalist) and phone helpline or crisis hotline. These last 2
types of providers were combined because the level of
248

endorsement did not meet Statistics Canada’s minimum cell
count criteria for disclosure.24
Service setting was assessed by asking the parent whether
the SC had gone to specific settings for mental health con-
cerns in the past 6 months. The settings included 1) specia-
lized mental health or addictions agencies, supported by
providing the parent with a geographically tailored list of
community agencies within their census division31; 2) a
walk-in clinic, urgent care facility, and hospital emergency
room; and 3) school-based setting accessed since the begin-
ning of the school year. Participants could endorse speaking
to more than 1 type of provider and/or going to more than 1
service setting. An indicator of any service contact was cre-
ated that included endorsement of contact with at least 1
provider or in at least 1 service setting described above.
Sociodemographic characteristics. Standard Statistics Canada
questions were administered to the parent about child age,
sex, number of biological parents in the home, household
income below the low-income measure (based on the 2013
before-tax cutoffs),32 immigrant background (children and
youth who were foreign-born or who had at least 1 foreign-
born parent were classified as immigrant), and urban-rural
residency (large urban, small-medium urban and rural) based
on population density and size.33
Statistical Analysis
The sample is based on the SC, chosen randomly in each
household for a more detailed assessment of mental dis-
order (i.e., MINI-KID) and mental health–related service
contacts (n ¼ 3809 children aged 4 to 11 years; n ¼ 2728
youth aged 12 to 17 years). About 10% of the sample was
missing at least 1 parent-reported variable (n ¼ 375 chil-
dren aged 4 to 11 years; n ¼ 309 youth aged 12 to 17
years). Children and youth with incomplete data were
more likely to live with 1 or no biological parent and
have a mental health–related service contact and a beha-
viour disorder. To address missed responses on study
variables, multivariate, multiple imputation by chained
equations (MICE) was performed in STATA 14.0.34 Sep-
arate imputation models were developed for each infor-
mant (i.e., parent and youth reports) that included
sampling design variables, all variables included in the
present study, and auxiliary variables associated with
missed responses. Primary analyses were based on 10
multiply imputed data sets, and results were combined
using Rubin’s combination rules.35,36 A comparison of
the estimates from imputed and complete case analyses
(available upon request) produced consistent results.
Prevalence estimates of mental disorders and service con-
tact are presented for children (4 to 11 years) and youth (12
to 17 years) by informant (parent, youth), sex, number of
biological parents in the home, household poverty, immi-
grant background, and urban-rural residency. Also presented
are cross-tabulations of the association between service
contact by provider type and setting and the following
mutually exclusive classifications of disorder: 1) pure mood
and/or anxiety, wherein the SC met criteria for mood and/or
anxiety disorders but not behaviour disorders; 2) pure beha-
viour, wherein the SC met criteria for behaviour disorders
but not mood and/or anxiety disorders; and 3) comorbid
mood/anxiety and behaviour, wherein the SC met criteria
for both mood and/or anxiety and behaviour disorders.
All analyses used sampling weights to generate preva-
lence estimates that are representative of the target popula-
tion of children and youth in Ontario. To account for the
complex survey design, mean bootstrap weights were
applied with an adjustment factor to produce accurate stan-
dard errors in STATA 14.0.34 To examine differences
between groups in the prevalence of any mental disorder and
mental health–related service contact, second-order Rao-
Scott correction to w2 tests (design-based F statistic) for
complex survey design37 was used to produce accurate test
statistics and associated P values. The false discovery rate
(FDR) method38 was employed to account for multiple com-
parisons. Estimates were suppressed when unweighted cell
counts were <10 and denoted with a “–.”24
Results
Table 1 presents sample characteristics: the majority lived
with 2 biological parents (71.2%), in large urban centres
(70.3%), and in nonimmigrant families (64.4%).
Table 2 presents 6-month prevalence estimates of disor-
der by age group, informant, and sex. The overall prevalence
of any disorder was 18.1% for children (4 to 11 years) and
18.2% for youth (12 to 17 years) based on parent report and
21.8% based on youth report. Integrating parent and youth
(12 to 17 years) reports of disorder yielded overall preva-
lence estimates of any disorder that ranged from 7.5% when
the “and” rule and 26.0% when the “or” rule was applied at
the disorder level (see online supplemental table).
Among youth (12 to 17 years), the overall prevalence of
any disorder was higher for females compared to males
based on youth report (25.4% versus 18.5%) but generally
higher in males compared to females based on parent report

(20.5% versus 15.8%). The higher prevalence of any disor-
der in females identified by youth was attributable to major
depressive episode (10.1% versus 5.1%) and generalized
anxiety (13.3% versus 6.3%). There were no significant sex
differences in the prevalence of anxiety disorders and major
depressive episode, based on parent report on youth (12 to 17
years). The higher prevalence of any disorder in males iden-
tified by parents was largely attributable to elevated rates of
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (7.5% versus 2.7% in
youth).
Table 3 presents the prevalence of any disorder by age
group, informant, and sociodemographic characteristics.
Correlates of any disorder were consistent across age
groups and informants. Prevalence of disorder was con-
sistently higher among children and youth living with 1
or no biological parent and consistently lower for those
living in an immigrant family. Among youth (12 to 17 years),
living in small to medium population centres was associated
with higher prevalence (32.6% youth report) compared to
large urban (19.1% youth report) and rural areas (23.0%
youth report).
Table 4 presents rates of mental health–related service
contacts in the past 6 months by disorder class, age group,
and informant. Among children and youth with an identified
disorder, overall rates of any service contact were 61.5% for
children (4 to 11 years) and 60.7% for youth (12 to 17 years)
when disorder classification was based on parent report. In
contrast, rates of any service contact were much lower when
disorder classification was based on youth report (43.7%).
Children with comorbid mood/anxiety and behaviour disor-
ders were most likely to have service contacts. Although
rates of any service contact were similar for pure mood/
anxiety and pure behaviour disorders identified in youth
(12 to 17 years) by parents or youth (49.6% versus 51.4%
and 39.9% versus 39.7%), this was not the case among chil-
dren (4 to 11 years). Rates of any service contact in this age
group were 66.3% for pure behaviour and 44.6% for pure
mood/anxiety. This difference was largely attributable to
school-based services where rates of service contact were
59.3% for pure behaviour and 31.9% for pure mood/anxiety
disorders.
Among youth, rates of service contact from mental health
and general health care providers were similar (33.7% and
35.1% for parent-reported disorder and 22.3% and 24.4% for
youth-reported disorder, respectively). Among children (4 to
11 years), 25.6% and 35.6% saw mental health and general
health care providers for mental health concerns, respec-
tively. The most common setting or sector for mental
health–related service contacts was the school (Table 4).
Table 5 presents the prevalence of service contact for
those classified with a mental disorder by age group, infor-
mant, and sociodemographic groups. Immigrant children
and youth were less likely to have a mental health–related
service contact (22.3%-50.3%) compared to their nonimmi-
grant peers (49.6%-63.8%). Children and youth with comor-
bid mood/anxiety and behaviour disorders were most likely

91.7%) compared to those with pure behaviour (39.7%-
66.3%) and pure mood/anxiety disorders (39.9%-49.6%).
Children living with 1 or no biological parent were more
likely to have a mental health–related service contact
(74.2%) compared to those living with 2 biological parents
(54.6%). When disorder classification was based on youth
report, females were less likely to have a mental health–
related service contact (37.7%) compared to males (51.6%).
Discussion
From 2014 to 2015, 18% to 22% of children and youth aged
4 to 17 years in Ontario met criteria for at least 1 DSM-IV-TR
mental disorder assessed in the Ontario Child Health Study.
Among children and youth with a parent-identified mental
disorder, only 26% of children (4 to 11 years) and 34% of
youth (12 to 17 years) had contact with a mental health care
provider, although a much larger proportion had mental
health–related service contacts with other providers and in
other settings.
Rates of service contact were consistently lower when
disorder classification was based on youth report. Children
and youth with comorbid mood/anxiety and behaviour dis-
orders had higher rates of service contact with a mental
health care provider compared to those with pure mood/anxi-
ety or pure behaviour disorders. Schools were the most com-
mon setting for mental health–related contacts with various
professionals. Across settings, general health and mental
health care practitioners were the most common providers.
The high prevalence of disorder and service gaps under-
scores the continued public health importance of child and
youth mental health in Ontario.
Sex differences in the prevalence of disorder were largely
consistent with previous studies,1,2,6,7 with 1 noteworthy
exception. Among youth (12 to 17 years), there was a rever-
sal in the pattern of sex differences based on parent versus
youth reports. The major classes of disorder contributing to
this reversal were mood and anxiety disorders. While pre-
valence estimates were similar for males and females based
on parent report, youth report revealed rates that were 2 to 3
times higher for females compared to males.
Past studies have documented more pronounced sex dif-
ferences in ratings of emotional problems based on youth
compared to parent reports.2,29 Given the critical role of
parents in initiating access to mental health services,20 par-
ental underidentification of anxiety and depression among
adolescent girls may be contributing to gender-related treat-
ment gaps. Consistent with past studies,15,18,19 children with
mood and/or anxiety disorders and females were generally
less likely to have mental health–related service contacts
compared to children with other classes of disorder and
males. These differences highlight the need to identify and
address gender-related barriers to the recognition of mental
disorders and use of mental health services. The prominent
role that parents and school-based and general health care
providers play in initiating access to services suggests that
such efforts should include a focus on improving identifica-
tion and care pathways for girls, particularly those with
mood and/or anxiety disorders.20

In terms of residency, prevalence of disorder among
youth was highest in small to medium centres compared to
large urban centres and rural areas. This contrasts with epi-
demiological studies reporting higher prevalence in urban
compared to rural areas.1,6 Our companion article documents
larger increases in the prevalence of mental disorders and
perceived need for professional help between 1983 and 2014
in small to medium centres and rural areas compared to large
urban centres.39
Differences between urban versus rural areas in the per-
centage of children (4 to 11 years) and youth (12 to 17 years)
with a mental disorder having mental health–related service
contacts did not reach statistical significance. These findings
contrast sharply with those reported in the 2017 Scorecard for
the Mental Health of Children and Youth in Ontario,40 which
document increased access and use of specialized physician-
based mental health care in urban compared to rural and
remote communities, drawing attention to conflicting results
attributable to sample and data source differences. It is impor-
tant to note that past US studies16,18 and the 1983 OCHS1 did
not report urban-rural differences in mental health service use
for children and youth. Further analyses of the 2014 OCHS
will be useful in refining our understanding of geographical
variation in access to child and youth mental health services,
the nature of services received, and barriers to care.
Consistent with past studies, prevalence of mental dis-
order was higher among children and youth living in non-
intact families6,13 and lower among those living in
immigrant families.8-10 In contrast, household poverty was
not associated with prevalence of disorder. Similar findings
have been reported using data from a national survey of US
adolescents that documented consistent associations between
parental education and mental disorder but no consistent pov-
erty effect.6,12 Past studies have demonstrated stronger asso-
ciations between poverty and mental disorder in children
compared to adolescents41,42 and for behaviour compared
to mood and anxiety disorders.42-45 Further analysis of
joint education-income effects by disorder class (i.e., beha-
viour versus mood/anxiety), age groups, and informants is
needed to enhance our understanding of associations between

family socioeconomic circumstances and child and youth
mental disorder.
Proportionately fewer immigrant children and youth with
a mental disorder had a mental health–related service contact
compared to those living in nonimmigrant families. Despite
their lower overall prevalence of disorder, these findings
point to important disparities in mental health–related ser-
vice contacts among children and youth from immigrant
backgrounds that need to be addressed.10
Children (4 to 11 years) living with 1 or no biological
parentwere more likely tohave a mental health–related service
contact compared to those living with 2 biological parents. The
higherprevalenceofmentaldisorderamongchildrenandyouth
living in nonintact families and their increased likelihood of
having mental health–related service contacts reinforce the
importance of family context in shaping mental health and
treatment pathways. The mechanisms underlying these asso-
ciations, including the presence and timing of relationship dis-
ruptions among caregivers, single parenthood, parental
psychopathology, and family stressors, warrant further study.
Strengths of the study include the large and representative
sample of children and their families, the use of a validated
diagnostic interview administered independently to parent
and youth that incorporated distress and/or an impairment
criterion in the classification of mental disorders, and com-
prehensive assessment of mental health–related service con-
tacts. Study limitations include our inability to document the
temporal ordering of study variables in relation to disorder
onset and persistence, low response rate, exclusions of
high-risk samples (i.e., youth living on reserves and in insti-
tutions), and specific disorders (i.e., substance use disor-
ders). In addition, our approach to classifying mental
health–related service contact relied solely on parental report
and should not be equated with receipt of mental health
treatment. Our goal was to establish the percentage of chil-
dren and youth who received some form of recognition for
mental health concerns, as an index of service contact within
our systems of care. Future studies will systematically exam-
ine the nature and level of satisfaction of care received and
perceived barriers to accessing care.

Conclusion
Without renewed attention to innovative service delivery
models,20,46,47 the gap between child and youth mental
health need in the population and the availability of specia-
lized mental health care is too large to bridge. Schools and
general health care providers represent settings and profes-
sionals that can help facilitate the implementation of a
stepped collaborative care model to child and youth mental
health, playing a pivotal role in the identification and man-
agement of mental health problems and referral to specia-
lized services for those children and youth most in need.
Such approaches will require significant training and super-
vision of nonspecialist providers and the establishment of
close partnerships across sectors of care, including mental
health, health, and education. Specific subgroups of children
and youth may also benefit from targeted prevention efforts
and outreach to facilitate access to mental health care,
including children from nonintact families, immigrant back-
grounds, and females with mood and/or anxiety disorders.
Despite significant growth in the field of child psychiatric
epidemiology, we continue to lack harmonized methods of
data collection on the magnitude, correlates, and associated
burden of mental disorders, rendering comparisons across
studies and contexts impossible. The high prevalence of child
and youth mental disorders and significant service gaps pro-
vide a strong rationale for continuing to prioritize research and
policies aimed at preventing mental disorders and facilitating
access to evidence-based care amongst those in need.
