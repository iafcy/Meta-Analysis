Abstract
Purpose: To examine readiness for treatment among adolescents with depression in primary care.
Methods: This article draws upon data from 184 depressed patients, aged 13 to 17, who participated
in the Teen Depression Awareness Project. Adolescents were screened assessed along a number of
domains at baseline and 6 months.
Results: Seventy-eight percent of the depressed teens acknowledged they had a problem with depres-
sion, yet only 25% were currently getting any sort of counseling or treatment for depression. A total of
40.8% of depressed adolescents were ‘‘ready’’ to get care, whereas 26.6% were ‘‘unsure’’ and 32.1%
were ‘‘not ready.’’ Signiﬁcant differences among these groups were observed for race/ethnicity and
household income. Adolescents in the ready group also had more depressive symptoms and lower
MHI-5 scores. Being in the ready group versus being ‘‘unsure’’ was a signiﬁcant predictor of service
use at the 6-month follow-up, as was the average number of days impaired and overall mental health
functioning. Race, gender, and age were not signiﬁcant predictors of readiness, yet average number of
depressive symptoms was signiﬁcantly associated with greater readiness.
Conclusions: Because teens in primary care settings are not seeking mental health treatments even
when depression is detected, providers should be mindful that adolescents may be at different stages
of recognition and readiness for treatment. Teens who are less ready for care may need follow-up
primary care visits or consultation to help them become more active in seeking care.  2009

Keywords:
Depression; Readiness of care; Primary care
Depressive disorders occur in roughly 20% of American
youth by age 18 [1] and have deleterious effects on academic,
social, and health functioning [2–4]. Although psychosocial
and pharmacological treatments have demonstrated efﬁcacy
for depressive disorders [5,6], many adolescents do not
receive them. Primary care is a promising venue for treatment
for depression because most adolescents have contact with
a primary care provider, and primary care is a common site
for depression treatment [7–10]. Further, research has shown
that efforts to improve depression treatment for adults in
primary care have paid off [11,12]. Nevertheless, many
adolescents with depression fail to seek care [3,13]. How
adolescents and their parents conceptualize symptoms and
emotional problems as well as what burden the illness places
on the family may play a critical role in whether adolescents
seek care or adhere to treatment plans [14–16]. Decisions
about getting treatment, as well as what type of treatment
to seek, may depend on whether one is motivated to seek
care. Whether an adolescent is ready to address his or her
depression and to consider treatment may predict interest
in, acceptance of, and adherence to treatment. Prochaska
and DiClemente [17] conceptualize health behavior change
as a process that involves progress through six stages—pre-
contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, mainte-
nance, and termination—and may help us understand why
some adolescents do not seek care for their depression.
This article describes acknowledgement of depression,
attitudes about treatment, and readiness to seek care among

a sample of depressed teens drawn from primary care. It also
examines the relationship between readiness for care and
future service use. We address three speciﬁc questions:
1. Which teens are ready to seek care for their depression?
2. How is readiness to seek care associated with treatment
preference?
3. To what extent is readiness to seek care related to care
seeking or care continuation?
Methods
Data source
Data are from Teen Depression Awareness Project and
include 184 adolescent primary care patients aged 13 to 17
years who screened positive for depression on a research
diagnostic interview, and 170 parents of those adolescents
[18,19]. Participants were recruited from seven healthcare
organizations, across 11 sites (in the Los Angeles and Wash-
ington, DC areas). We selected sites to maximize diversity of
medical ofﬁces, including free, public, private-managed care,
and private insurance, that served diverse patients in terms of
ethnicity and race.
Study procedures
Enrollment occurred between January 2005 and March
2006, and consisted of approaching the adolescent (and
parent/guardian, if present) at the medical ofﬁce, explaining
the project and obtaining signed adolescent assent and
parent/guardian consent (approved by the institutional review
boards at RAND and each health organization, if applicable).
After completing contact sheets in the primary care setting
(refusal rates to complete the form among those approached
varied by site and ranged from 1% to 40%), a total of 5407
teens were contacted by phone for study enrollment and
screening; 143 were determined to be ineligible (3%), 347
refused study participation (6%), 204 (4%) could not be
reached, and 4713 were enrolled in the study. Once enrolled,
adolescents were interviewed via telephone to determine
eligibility for participation (n ¼ 4713), using the Diagnostic
Interview Schedule for Children [20–23] depression module.
We deﬁned teens as ‘‘depressed’’ (n ¼ 187 or 3.97% of those
screened) if they met criteria for a depressive episode of 2
weeks or more in the prior 6 months, and reported at least
three depressive symptoms in the prior 2 weeks, so as to
include both currently depressed teens and those who
reported a recent depressive episode and lingering symptoms
at the time of assessment. Other inclusion criteria for the
project included: currently attending school within 2 years
of expected grade level, currently living with parent/
guardian, not currently pregnant, adolescent and parent
speaking Spanish or English, and not having a sibling already
enrolled in the study. Adolescents and parents who partici-
pated in the study were interviewed (via Computer Assisted
Telephone Interviews or CATI) at two points in time: imme-
diately or shortly after the diagnostic interview, and again
approximately 6 months later (n ¼ 184). Adolescents were
assessed along several dimensions, including health status,
symptoms of depression, emotional functioning, as well as
knowledge/attitudes about treatment, and demographic char-
acteristics. All adolescents received feedback via mail on
their screening assessment, as well as an educational
brochure about depression. Half of the depressed adolescents
(randomly selected) also received a guide to local mental
health resources and were scheduled to receive a telephone
motivational intervention with the TDAP counselor. (More
information about this telephone-based motivational inter-
vention can obtained through the primary author.) The coun-
selor made notes from these sessions that documented
adolescents’ acknowledgment of depression and willingness
to seek care. There were no signiﬁcant differences on the
variables presented in this article between the teens who
received those calls and those teens that did not at baseline
or 6-month follow-up.
Measures
The readiness for treatment measure was constructed by
compiling responses from the baseline teen and parent inter-
views. To create this measure, we ﬁrst created a six-point
readiness variable and then collapsed the six levels into
a three level variable for Ready, Unsure, and Not Ready.
Using this measure, adolescents and parents were assigned
to one of three groups: the Ready for Care group includes
adolescents in treatment or working on getting treatment at
the time of the interview. To be included in this group respon-
dents indicated YES/AGREE to ‘‘Are you currently getting
counseling, treatment or medications for depression?’’
(RTREAT ¼ 6) OR to ‘‘I am working on getting treatment’’
(RTREAT ¼ 5). The Unsure group includes adolescents that
(at baseline) reported thinking about whether treatment
would help or who reported thinking they should get treat-
ment but had not sought care yet. Speciﬁcally respondents
in this group indicated YES/AGREE to the following: ‘‘I
think
I
should
get
treatment
for
my
depression’’
(RTREAT ¼ 4) OR ‘‘I am thinking about whether or not
treatment would help with my depression’’ (RTREAT ¼ 3).
Finally, the Not Ready for Care group included adolescents
who at baseline did not acknowledge having depression or
who were not thinking about treatment. This group includes
respondents who indicated YES to ‘‘Most teenagers are
depressed at some time. Do you think you had a problem
with depression in the last 4 weeks?’’ AND did not fall
into ‘‘Ready for Care’’ (RTREAT ¼ 2) or ‘‘Unsure’’ above
OR If the respondent indicated NO to ‘‘Most teenagers are
depressed at some time. Do you think you had a problem
with depression in the last 4 weeks?’’ (RTREAT ¼ 1). We
used the same convention for the Parent variable; however,
the items were worded to inquire about the teen ‘‘I am
working on getting treatment for (his/her name).’’
We assessed mental health-related quality of life using the
SF-12 [24]; however, modifying the item on physical

impairments and replacing the word ‘‘work’’ with ‘‘school-
work’’ to make the scale more relevant to adolescents. To
assess mental health functioning, we added items from the
Mental Health Index [24] and calculated the Mental Health
Composite Score (MCS-12). We measured depressive symp-
toms/severity using the Patient Health Questionnaire for
Adolescents [25]. To assess number of depressive symptoms
and depression severity, we created a new variable that added
10 depression-related symptoms and assigned greater value
to symptoms experienced ‘‘nearly every day’’ (value of 2)
versus ‘‘for a few days’’ (value of 1). Symptoms that were
not experienced were given a value of 0. To measure self-
efﬁcacy, we asked adolescents to rate their conﬁdence in their
own ability to overcome or control depression on a scale of
0 to 10, where 10 equals as conﬁdent as they can be [26].
We assessed overall disability or days of impairment with
the Sheehan Disability Scale [27], to produce a composite
score for functional impairment. We also assessed experience
with mental health treatment in the previous 6 months, using
questions to determine if the adolescent had seen a provider
or taken medication for an emotional problem in the previous
6 months. A three-point service use measure (0, 1, 2) was
constructed to assess intensity of treatment, based on the
adolescent’s report of currently receiving counseling or anti-
depressants for depression, where 0 is no treatment,
1 ¼ either counseling or antidepressants, and 2 ¼ the combi-
nation of counseling and antidepressants. We assessed pref-
erence for treatment in the future (using a hypothetical need
for treatment): no treatment, follow-up with a provider
(‘‘watchful waiting’’), counseling only, medications only,
or counseling and medications together. All items were
assessed at baseline and repeated at the 6-month follow-up.
Statistical analysis
During the CATI process, respondents were allowed to
skip items they did not know or refused to answer, resulting
in a small amount of missing data. A few items, such as
household income and insurance type, were missing for the
8% of adolescents whose parents did not complete the parent
survey. Therefore, we used multiple imputation to impute
ﬁve copies of the missing data elements and used these impu-
tations to construct ﬁve replicates of completed data. All
bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted ﬁve times
on each data set and then results were combined using stan-
dard multiple imputation rules [28,29] to obtain parameter
estimates and their adjusted standard errors that reﬂect the
uncertainty because of imputation. The amount of missing
data was minimal; the most missing data occurred for the
indicator that a teen had depression in the past 4 weeks
(10% missing), with the next highest number of missing
values for number of days impaired (2% missing). For both
regression analyses presented in Tables 4 to 5, the relative
increase in the variance of our estimates attributable to
missing data was trivial (at most 2%) and the relative efﬁcien-
cies of our multiple imputation-based estimates were almost
one in all cases.
We performed basic descriptive analyses of demographic
and clinical characteristic and performed bivariate descrip-
tive analyses to present the percentage of adolescents in
each of the Readiness Groups by relevant demographic and
clinical characteristics. Analysis of variance was used to
test whether continuous individual characteristics (e.g., age,
MHI-5, number of depressive symptoms, number of days
impaired) signiﬁcantly varied by readiness for treatment.
We examined Wald chi-squared test statistics for predictors
in simple ordinal logistic regressions of readiness for treat-
ment on categorical predictors to identify signiﬁcant bivariate
associations. The SURVEYREG and SURVEYLOGISTIC
procedures in SAS 9.1.4 were used so that bivariate signiﬁ-
cance tests accounted for intracluster correlation among
clients within treatment site. Testing bivariate associations
using regression modeling also allowed us to combine results
across analyses of multiple imputed data sets to account for
uncertainty because of missing data. We examined the asso-
ciation between clinical and demographic characteristics,
readiness for treatment, and service use to assess what factors
predict service use at 6-month follow-up. We also examined
the association between clinical and demographic character-
istics and readiness for treatment to assess what might predict
readiness. To do this, we modeled readiness for treatment at
baseline and service use at 6-month follow-up using multi-
level ordinal logistic regressions as implemented in SAS
Proc GLIMMIX [30]. We included a random intercept term
in each model to account for intracluster correlation among
clients within treatment site. We controlled for teen demo-
graphic (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, and gender) and mental
health characteristics (e.g., number of depressive symptoms,
average number of days impaired, and MCS-12) in our anal-
yses. We present adjusted odds ratios for each model coefﬁ-
cient. We assessed the adequacy of the ordinal regression
model ﬁt relative to multinomial logistic regression by
comparing
the
Bayesian
Information
Criterion
(BIC)
between models to see whether the additional complexity
of the multinomial logistic regression model was warranted.
Results
Adolescent and parent demographic characteristics
Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteris-
tics of depressed adolescents (n ¼ 184) and their parents
(n ¼ 170). Depressed adolescents averaged 15.2 years of
age, were mostly female (78.3%), and predominantly
Hispanic (50.6%) or black (30.4%). Parents of the depressed
adolescents averaged 44.2 years of age, were mostly female
(89.4%) and predominantly Hispanic (47.0%) or black
(32.7%). Almost half of the parent sample had at least
some college education (45.0%) and just over a third
(35.1%) reported household income of at least $50,000.
Depressed adolescents had an average MHI-5 score of

13.93 (SD ¼ 3.59), and reported an average of 3.41 depres-
sive symptoms in the past 4 weeks, and having been impaired
an average of 12 days of the last 30.
Adolescent and parent clinical characteristics and
perceptions about treatment
A total of 78.1% of adolescents acknowledged having
a problem, and slightly more than a half (54.1%) of parents
acknowledged their child had a problem (Table 2). A third
of depressed adolescents (33.6%) reported that depression
was a serious problem. Yet only one-quarter of the depressed
adolescents (25.1%) reported currently being in treatment.
With respect to readiness for treatment, we found 40.8% of
depressed adolescents were ‘‘ready,’’ 26.6% were ‘‘unsure,’’
and 32.1% ‘‘not ready.’’ Slightly over a third (34.8%) re-
ported receiving help from a mental health specialist in the
prior 6 months. The majority of adolescents (based on a hypo-
thetical need for help in the future) preferred counseling only
(32.2%), followed by a combination of counseling and anti-
depressant medications (22.4%); antidepressants alone were
preferred only by 10.9% of depressed adolescents. Parents
of these same adolescents, however, preferred some form
of treatment to no treatment (no parent indicated a desire
for no treatment as opposed to 16.9% of adolescents), and
overwhelmingly preferred counseling only to other options
(57.1% of parents preferred counseling only; less than 1%
indicated a preference for medications only).
Differences by readiness group
Adolescents were compared along several demographic
and clinical characteristics by readiness group (see Table
3). More females were ready for treatment, although the
difference was not statistically signiﬁcant, c2 (3) ¼ 3.70,
p ¼.054. Signiﬁcant differences were observed for race/
ethnicity, c2 (3) ¼ 27.84, p < .0001, with the majority of
African American teens in the unsure group and the majority
of Hispanics in the not ready group; and household income,
c2 (4) ¼ 10.78, p ¼ .029167, with the majority of those in the
ready group having a household income over $30,000 per

year. Adolescents in the ready group also had more depres-
sive symptoms, F (2, 173) ¼ 8.91, p ¼ .0002, and lower
MHI-5 scores, F (2, 173) ¼ 6.47, p ¼ .0019. Given a hypo-
thetical future need for care adolescents in the ready group
were also more likely to report a preference for combined
treatment (counseling and medication) than adolescents in
the other groups; where as adolescents in the not-ready group
reported a preference for counseling only or no treatment,
c2 (4) ¼ 76.76, p < .0001. No signiﬁcant differences were
observed by age, parent education, perceived severity, or
utilization of care in the past 6 months.
Relationship between readiness for treatment and future
service use
At the 6-month follow-up, 48.9% of the depressed adoles-
cents reported receiving either counseling or an antidepres-
sant since the baseline interview, with 14.7% of the
depressed adolescents reported receiving both counseling
and an antidepressant during that time (data not shown);
however, only 29% were in treatment at the actual time of
the follow up interview. To examine whether baseline readi-
ness was a signiﬁcant predictor of service use at the follow-
up interview, we employed an ordinal logistic regression
model using the three-level measure of service use, where
service use could have been new since baseline or continued
since baseline (0 ¼ no treatment, 1 ¼ either counseling or
antidepressants, and 2 ¼ combination of counseling and anti-
depressants). Being in the ready group versus being ‘‘unsure’’
was a signiﬁcant predictor of service use at the 6-month
follow-up, as was the average number of days impaired and
overall mental health functioning (as measured by the
MCS-12). Race/ethnicity was also a signiﬁcant predictor of
service use at follow-up, with blacks and Hispanics having
signiﬁcantly less service use than whites; gender and age
were not signiﬁcant (see Table 4). Depressive symptoms at
baseline were not related to service use at follow-up in the
regression models that also controlled for demographic
factors. The BIC for the ordinal logistic regression model
was 393.79, which was smaller than that for the multinomial
logistic regression (BIC ¼ 428.28), thus providing greater
support in the data for modeling the outcome as ordinal.
To examine what factors were signiﬁcant predictors of
readiness, we employed a second ordinal logistic regression
model using the three-level readiness measure deﬁned earlier
(Table 5). The BIC for the ordinal logistic regression model
was 406.64, which was smaller than that for the multinomial
logistic regression (BIC ¼ 442.08), thus providing greater
support in the data for modeling the outcome as ordinal.
Race, gender, and age were not signiﬁcant predictors of read-
iness. Average number of symptoms was signiﬁcantly asso-
ciated with greater readiness; yet days impaired, mental
health functioning, and perceived self-efﬁcacy were not asso-
ciated with readiness. Parent acknowledgement of the teen
having a problem with depression was signiﬁcantly associ-
ated with greater teen readiness, although the parent’s
previous service use at baseline was not a signiﬁcant
predictor of treatment at 6-month follow-up.

Insights from qualitative interviews
Roughly half of the depressed adolescents received a tele-
phone call about 2 months following their baseline interview
to conﬁrm that the adolescent received the feedback letter and
education materials. The counselor asked several questions
about how the teen perceived the information and whether
the adolescent was considering following up on the informa-
tion. Although participation in this call had no impact on our
results, the notes from these calls provide interesting insights.
In general, adolescents were willing to discuss their thoughts
about their depression and their thoughts on getting help.
Counselors asked teens to rate their readiness to get help
for depression on a ‘‘readiness ruler.’’ We found that the
adolescents who were ready to change their depression
(based on their self-report during the call) were more inter-
ested in formal treatment options, whereas the adolescents
who were not ready were most comfortable talking about
informal or self-help options, such as learning more about
depression or talking with a parent. Many of the adolescents
who reported a high motivation to change intended to get
help but also needed prompting: although many adolescents
noted that they wanted to get help for their depression, they
had not yet taken the steps needed. In these cases, it appeared

next step.
Discussion
Although prior work on adults has shown that readiness to
seek care is an important factor in seeking mental healthcare,
there has been little work done related to teens. This work
represents the ﬁrst step. Our results indicate that readiness
is important, because it is related to the propensity to seek
or continue care 6 months after detection of depression.
Teen readiness for care at baseline increased the odds of
getting care at 6 months, even after controlling for symptom
severity. It should be noted that this care included psycho-
therapy, medication, and combination treatment, with no
judgment of what type of care might be most appropriate
for teens with varying levels of symptoms. Recent studies
on the treatment of teen depression show that combination
treatment is most effective for teens with major depression
[31], but there has been little information to date to guide
treatment decision making for particular teens or for partic-
ular severity levels. Our sample included teens with recent
depression and lingering symptoms, as well as those with
current depression, and thus all of them would be candidates
for intervention of some type. Thus, our analysis only
comments on the intensity of treatment, not on treatment
type or appropriateness.

Our results revealed substantial variability among teen’s
readiness for care at the baseline assessment. Adolescents
with more severe depression were more ready to seek care,
as were girls, white teens, and adolescents with a parent-
reported household income above $30,000 per year. Thus,
many teens may need help increasing readiness to seek care
[32]. In particular, boys and those with milder depression
may need special outreach. Teens’ readiness to seek care
was also related to a higher preference for combined treat-
ments, whereas those who were unsure said they would prefer
counseling or watchful waiting. Thus, teens in the ready group
were not only more ready to seek care, but they were also more
open to seeking care with the best evidence-base at present.
Parent acknowledgement of the teen’s depression had a strong
impact on teen readiness independent of symptoms, suggest-
ing that educational and motivational interventions may be
needed to help teens and parents improve awareness that teens
may be suffering from depression, to understand treatment
options, and to seek care. Although a similar percentage of
teens and parents preferred combination treatment, most
parents preferred counseling alone, suggesting that evidence-
based counseling needs to be more readily available to teens
and parents. These ﬁndings highlight that in the primary care
setting, detection of depression and feedback to parents, teens,
and providers isonly one partoftheprocess in helpingteens get
treatment, given that many teens and parents are not ready to
begin taking steps to obtain care.
Implications for future research and practice
Efforts to enhance depression care for teens in primary
care settings [3] show that modest uptake of services can
improve teen outcomes. Because teens in primary care are
not seeking mental health treatment, providers who detect
depression in these settings should be mindful that adoles-
cents may be at different stages of recognition and readiness
for intervention. Although these teens have at least sought
primary care, they may not have considered or be ready for
mental health treatment. As such, screening or detection
efforts should include questions about how the teen and
parent perceive the problem, how severe they think it is,
and whether they are considering care. These questions
appear to be important in deciding which teens can get
a referral with reasonable conﬁdence of follow-up, and which
teens will need more discussion before receiving a referral.
Providers might also inquire about what types of help appeal
most to the adolescent and parent so that the education about
options and the relative efﬁcacy of each can be delivered.
Teens who are less ready may need follow-up visits or phone
consultation to become more active in seeking care for them-
selves. Lessons from substance abuse research, including
ways to increase readiness or to move people from contem-
plation to action, such as motivational interviewing, may
apply to depressed teens in primary care settings [33,34].
This study demonstrated that readiness is associated with
later treatment use and preferences among a group of teens
seeking care in primary care ofﬁce setting; however, more
work is needed to examine factors that inﬂuence readiness
for depression treatment, particularly how parent and teen
readiness interact and drive treatment decision making
among noncare-seeking populations as well. More work is
also needed to assess whether readiness for care can be
enhanced through techniques such as motivational interview-
ing or patient activation and empowerment. Alegria et al’s
[35] ﬁndings suggest that such an approach can increase
treatment attendance and retention in adults, but more
research is needed to examine if these strategies will increase
treatment uptake in adolescents.
