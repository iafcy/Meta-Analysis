Objective: The study examined lifetime use of mental health
services among children diagnosed as having mental disor-
ders in two major cities in Brazil and identiﬁed characteristics
associated with unmet need.
Methods: The data were collected as part of the High Risk
Cohort Study, a community study conducted in Sao Paulo
and Porto Alegre, Brazil. During the period from 2010 to
2011, a total of 2,511 children ages 6 to 12 were assessed, and
652 were given a diagnosis of at least one mental disor-
der. The current study analyzed data for a subsample of
651 children with complete information on use of mental
health services.
Results: Eighty-one percent of the children with mental
disorders had not received mental health treatment in the
past. The majority who received treatment were treated
with psychotherapy or a combination of psychotherapy
and medication. Mixed-race children were signiﬁcantly more
likely to have unmet need for treatment, compared with
white children.
Conclusions: The high rate of unmet need among children
with mental disorders should be addressed with strategies
to improve access to health care.

Around the world, regardless of national-income level,
mental disorders affect 13% of the child and adolescent
population (1) and are the leading cause of years lived with
disability in this age group (2). Even though there is a wide
range of evidence-based interventions available to treat
various mental disorders among youths, lack of policies and
resources prevent children from obtaining adequate treat-
ment (3). Approximately one-half of children with men-
tal disorders do not receive any treatment (4), potentially
leading to worsening of symptoms and a chronic trajectory.
Evidence of mental health service use among children
with mental disorders is essential to identify the current
gaps in treatment. Such data can provide the basis for future
mental health policies and health system changes seeking to
bridge these gaps. However, there is a scarcity of evidence
for low- and middle-incomes countries, where 88% of the
world’s children live. These countries have fewer mental
health professionals than would be required to deliver
adequate mental health interventions to the population in
need (5).
To date, only two studies in Brazil have described mental
health service use among children and adolescents. A lon-
gitudinal study conducted in a poor municipality of Sao
Paulo state (N=93) showed that 62.5% of children and ado-
lescents with persistent mental disorders, as measured by a
screening instrument, did not receive treatment (6). An ep-
idemiological study conducted in four small cities located in
four Brazilian regions (N=1,721) found that 80.2% of children
and adolescents with mental disorders, as measured by a
diagnostic instrument, did not receive treatment (7). Neither
study evaluated details about treatments, such as modality,
duration, speciﬁc medications, and providers. Information
about these factors would allow policy makers to optimize
distribution of health systems resources. The aim for our
study was to describe lifetime use of mental health services
among children diagnosed as having mental disorders in two
major cities in Brazil, to describe characteristics of the
treatments received, and to identify sociodemographic and
HIGHLIGHTS
• The majority of the children with mental disorders did not
receive mental health treatment (81.0%).
• Psychotherapy and a combination of psychotherapy with
medication were the most used treatments.
• Being a mixed-race child was associated with unmet

clinical characteristics associated with unmet need for
services.
METHODS
The study was based on data from a large community sample
of children ages 6 to 12 from schools in Sao Paulo and Porto
Alegre, Brazil. Among 9,937 children who were screened
from 57 public schools, we recruited 1,500 children by using
a randomized procedure, of which 957 completed assess-
ment. We also recruited 2,371 children by using a procedure
that prioritized children at higher risk of mental disor-
ders based on family history of mental disorder or current
symptoms in any of ﬁve domains: attention-deﬁcit hyper-
activity disorder, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
psychosis, and learning disorders. The purpose of this pro-
cedure was to develop a sample with a higher prevalence
of mental disorders and to enhance power to identify de-
velopmental trajectories. A total of 1,554 children recruited
by using this procedure completed assessment. The ﬁnal
sample consisted of 2,511 children. Among the total sample,
652 met the criteria for a diagnosis of at least one mental
disorder by means of the Development and Well-Being As-
sessment (8) administered by trained lay interviewers to
biological parents. This study was focused on a subsample of
651 children with complete information on mental disorders
and use of mental health services. Additional details re-
garding the sampling procedure and other methodological
aspects can be found elsewhere (9). The study was approved
by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Sao
Paulo Medical School, and interviews were carried out after
written consent by caregivers. The study was conducted
between 2010 and 2011.
A questionnaire developed speciﬁcally for this study was
administered to caregivers to assess mental health service
use and treatments (use of medication, use of psychotherapy,
duration of treatment, type of provider (public or private),
and professional). All questions referred to the child’s life-
time. We collected data on child and family characteristics,
including children’s age, gender, and race (white, black, or
mixed); school dropout (more than 1 month without going to
school); school grade retention (repeating at least one aca-
demic year of school); presence of child abuse (being beaten
or hurt by an adult, being unable to eat or having no clothes
to wear, being sexually abused, or experiencing verbal ag-
gression); family enrollment in a welfare program (any ﬁ-
nancial help given by the government); maternal years of
schooling; maternal unemployment; and maternal psycho-
pathology as assessed by the Mini International Psychiatric
Interview (MINI) (10). Children with unmet need were
deﬁned as having any mental disorder and no previous use of
mental health services.
Cross-tabulations between use of mental health services
(unmet need versus met need) and sociodemographic char-
acteristics were used to describe the data. Multivariate lo-
gistic regression was used to identify correlates of service
use. All variables were selected based on theory and em-
pirical evidence from previous studies. A single model with
all sample characteristics was conducted, and odds ratios
and p values are reported. To adjust for the oversampling of
high-risk children, we used sampling weights derived from
propensity scores based on the probability of the child’s
being selected for the high-risk sample (11). Statistical
analyses were conducted using the survey command with
sampling weights in Stata 15. We considered the threshold
for statistical signiﬁcance to be p,.05 and provided 95%
conﬁdence intervals (95% CIs) for parameters.
RESULTS
Among children ages 6 to 12 who were diagnosed as having a
mental disorder (N=651), 81.0% (95% CI=76.6%284.7%) did
not receive any mental health treatment in their lifetime.
Among those treated, 5.2% (95% CI=2.0%212.6%) were
treated with medication only, 47.6% (95% CI=36.2%259.2%)
with psychotherapy only, and 44.7% (95% CI=35.8%2
58.8%) with both medication and psychotherapy. The mean
duration of treatment among those receiving medication
and those receiving psychotherapy was 25.8 months (95%
CI=17.1–34.4) and 22.7 months (95% CI=16.5–29.2), respec-
tively. Those who used medication obtained prescriptions
from the public health system (56.7%, 95% CI=40.5%271.6%),
private health system (37.9%, 95% CI=24.0%254.2%), and
both systems (4.9%, 95% CI=1.0%220.5%). Antidepressants
were used by 38.7% (95% CI=24.5%255.0%), benzodiaze-
pines by 3.9% (95% CI=.9%214.5%), stimulants by 36.1%
(95% CI=22.3%252.8%), anticonvulsants by 30.0% (95%
CI=17.7%246.2%), antipsychotics by 28.5% (95% CI=15.0%2
47.3%), and other medication classes by 10.4% (95% CI=3.3%2
28.6%) of the sample. Children who were treated with
psychotherapy obtained treatment from the public health
system (63.0%, 95% CI=50.6%273.9%), private health sys-
tem (32.2%, 95% CI=21.7%244.7%), and both types of pro-
viders (4.4%, 95% CI=1.5%211.8%).
Table 1 shows the relationship between child and family
characteristics and receipt of mental health services among
children diagnosed as having a mental disorder. A higher
proportion of mixed-race (black/white) children had unmet
need, compared with white children (87.8% versus 77.4%),
and mixed-race children were more likely than white
children to have unmet need (OR=2.0, p=.036). A higher
proportion of children living in Sao Paulo had unmet need,
compared with children living in Porto Alegre (86.4%
versus 78.2%); however, this difference was not statisti-
cally signiﬁcant. Other characteristics, such as type of
mental disorder, were not signiﬁcantly associated with
unmet need.
DISCUSSION
Our study showed that a high proportion (81.0%) of children
with mental disorders did not receive any mental health

treatment in their lifetime. Among those who received
treatment, the majority were treated with psychotherapy
or a combination of psychotherapy and medication in the
public health system. Antidepressants and stimulants were
the most frequently used medication classes. Being a mixed-
race child was signiﬁcantly associated with having unmet
need.
These ﬁndings should be
interpreted in light of some
limitations. The sample was
not
representative
of
the
population
from
the
two
major cities. Also, the sample
was derived through a sam-
pling procedure designed to
identify a subsample of chil-
dren with increased risk of
mental
disorders.
Never-
theless, all analyses were
weighted by a score that ad-
justed for the oversampling
strategy. Also, lifetime treat-
ment receipt is subject to
recall bias, and our ﬁndings
could have underestimated
the real prevalence of service
use. Last, other characteris-
tics not assessed in our study
could
potentially
explain
differences
between
the
children whose need were
met and those with unmet
need. For instance, stigma is
known to play an important
role in the likelihood that
caregivers will seek mental
health treatment for young
people (12).
Rates of unmet need in
high-income countries are
much lower. Data from the
World Health Organization
World Mental Health Survey
Initiative showed disparities
in the treatment gap among
countries. In lower-middle-
income countries, only 13.7%
of adults who met the crite-
ria for mental disorders re-
ceived treatment, compared
with 22.0% in upper-middle-
income countries and 36.8%
in high-income countries
(13). The treatment gap is
broader for youth, compared
with
other
age
groups
worldwide, with service utilization rates ranging from 2.2%
to 63.0% (4). Rates of unmet need in low- and middle-
income countries, compared with high-income countries,
may be related to deﬁciencies in the organization of the
mental health system and a lack of adequate policies and
adequate professional training, as well as a lack of imple-
mentation of evidence-based treatments (3, 4).

FATORI ET AL.

The rate of unmet need in our study (81.0%) was similar
to that found in Paula’s (7) epidemiological study, con-
ducted in small Brazilian cities (80.2%). On the other hand,
our ﬁnding was higher than the rate found in the longitu-
dinal study conducted in the metropolitan area near the
city of Sao Paulo (62.5%). However, the longitudinal study
focused on children and adolescents with chronic mental
disorders as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist
and followed them for 5 years. The lower rate could be
explained by the fact that the children in the longitudinal
study potentially had severe mental disorders with more rec-
ognizable symptoms.
In Brazil, the number of mental health professionals is
known to be inadequate to meet the current demand, a
common trend found in other low- and middle-income
countries (5). In 2010, Brazil had 15.5 psychologists and 3.1
psychiatrists per 100,000 population. In the same year, Sao
Paulo had 20.9 psychologists and 6.3 psychiatrists per
100,000 population, while Porto Alegre had 29.1 psycholo-
gists and 19.1 psychiatrists per 100,000 population. The
difference in the likelihood of unmet need between children
living in Sao Paulo and those living in Porto Alegre, even
though not statistically signiﬁcant, may be explained by the
differences in available human resources between the two
cities. Such differences may be accounted for by economic
inequalities between states and regions, as well as by dif-
ferences between regions in the government’s investment in
mental health services. Differences between regions were
also reported in a previous study (7).
In our sample, we found that mixed-race children who
fulﬁlled criteria for mental disorders were more likely to
have unmet need for mental health treatment, compared
with white children. Because the only other study that
sought to identify correlates of unmet need in Brazil did not
assess children’s race, we are not able to compare our results
(7). However, racial disparities in access to mental health
services have been reported in the past two decades. In the
United States, Latino and African-American youths have
lower rates of use of mental health services, compared with
non-Latino and white children (14). Racial and ethnic dy-
namics vary widely across the globe, leading to multiple
potential explanations for these ﬁndings. In Brazil, racial
inequalities are persistent and pervasive. Data from the lat-
est census showed that the average household income of the
white population was more than double that of the black
population. Racial economic inequalities could explain the
association between mixed race and unmet need in our
sample. Future studies could conﬁrm this hypothesis, as well
as explore other potential correlates and mechanisms that
could explain this association.
CONCLUSIONS
The high rate of unmet need among children with mental
disorders is alarming and should be addressed with strate-
gies to improve access to the health system and campaigns to
enhance awareness about mental disorders among youths.
The lack of mental health professionals could be addressed
by increasing the mental health budget. Services for families
with mixed-race children should be prioritized by policy
makers. Primary care programs with a national scope could
be used as tools to reach this vulnerable group. Also, in-
tegrating educational and social systems with health services
could help identify and treat children with mental disorders.
In Brazil, a country with deep-rooted racial inequalities, it
is paramount to take into account the role of race as a bar-
rier to use of health services. Future studies can determine
the speciﬁc barriers preventing mixed-race children with
mental disorders from receiving treatment and can provide
support for the development of mental health policies. De-
tails about treatment received by children and adolescents
with mental disorders should be further investigated in
future studies. For instance, understanding whether the
psychotherapies being delivered are based on scientiﬁc ev-
idence could help optimize resources and help make sure
patients receive effective treatments.
