Background and Objective: Adolescent depression is common,
disabling, and is associated with academic, social, behavioral, and
health consequences. Despite the availability of evidence-based
depression care, few teens receive it, even when recognized by
primary care clinicians. Perceived barriers such as teen worry about
what others think or parent concerns about cost and access to care
may contribute to low rates of care. We sought to better understand
perceived barriers and their impact on service use.
Design: After completing an eligibility and diagnostic telephone
interview, all depressed teens and a matched sample of nonde-
pressed teens recruited from 7 primary care practices were enrolled
and completed telephone interviews at baseline and 6 months
(August 2005–September 2006).
Participants: Three hundred sixty-eight adolescent patients aged 13 to
17 (184 depressed and 184 nondepressed) and 338 of their parents.
Measures: Perceived barriers to depression care and use of services
for depression (psychotherapy and antidepressant medication).
Results: Teens with depression were signiﬁcantly more likely to
perceive barriers to care compared with nondepressed teens. Parents
were less likely to report barriers than their teens; perceived stigma
and concern about family member response were among the signif-
icant teen barriers. Teen perceived barriers scores were negatively
associated with any use of antidepressants (P  0.01), use of
antidepressants for at least 1 month (P  0.001), and any psycho-
therapy or antidepressant use (P  0.05) at 6 months.
Conclusions: To improve treatment for adolescent depression, in-
terventions should address both teen and parent perceived barriers
and primary care clinicians should elicit information from both
adolescents and their parents.

epression in adolescents is common and disabling,1,2
with an estimated 15% to 20% of youth experiencing a
depressive disorder by the age of 18.1 Adolescent depression
is associated with a range of negative academic, social, and
health outcomes, including adult depression, suicide completed,
substance abuse, pregnancy, early parenthood, and impaired
social and school functioning.1,3–8
Several psychosocial and pharmacological treatments
have been shown to be efﬁcacious in treating depression in
adolescents. These include cognitive-behavioral therapy, in-
terpersonal psychotherapy, and some selective serotonin re-
uptake inhibitors.3,9–15 Despite the availability of evidence-
based care for depression, most teens with depression do not
receive treatment,3,16–18 with primary care clinicians (PCCs)
providing the majority of care to those who are treated.19–21
Studies have documented that there is often a multiyear time
lag between the onset of mental health symptoms in children
and adolescents and their receipt of appropriate treatment.22
Improvement in care for depressed adults has been
achieved in the primary care setting,23–27 and similar efforts
have been shown be an effective way to improve care and
outcomes for depressed adolescents.28 Thus, primary care is
a promising venue for improving access to care for depressed
teens, However, barriers to care can interfere with both
receipt and continuity of care.
Although there has been extensive work on barriers to
depression care for adults,29 few studies have examined barriers
to adolescent depression care. The perceived barriers that have
been identiﬁed include adolescent or parent concerns about
revealing an adolescent’s emotional problems (stigma), barriers
to access including insurance limitations,30,31 parental lack of
awareness, PCC’s lack of knowledge, and discomfort with
treating adolescent’s depression itself can contribute to the
under-treatment of adolescent depression. Further, percep-
tions of adolescents and their parents about the availability
and effectiveness of treatment and the social stigma associ-
ated with revealing emotional problems are critical to the
decision to seek treatment.32 Wisdom et al33 identiﬁed 3 key
themes that affect teen health care seeking for depression.
Depression adversely affects teens’ self-perception making
them feel abnormal, disconnected, and dependent on others.
These challenges, in turn, make it difﬁcult for teens to seek
care. As these studies suggest, examining barriers to care in
adolescents may be more complicated than in adults because
many adolescents will likely rely on their parents for both
material support (transportation, money) and emotional sup-
port (agreement that treatment is important and valid) for

depression care. Thus, barriers to depression care for adoles-
cents may stem from several sources: adolescent patients,
their parents, their PCCs, and systemic factors.
We sought to better understand the perceived barriers
of adolescents and their parents in the primary care setting,
and to understand to what extent perceived barriers affect
receipt of care during the 6 months after depression is
detected. Perceived barriers are an important component of
the Health Belief Model34 in which individuals weigh the
perceived barriers against the perceived beneﬁts of taking
some action to inﬂuence decisions about treatment-seeking,
which ultimately affects receipt of care. This study addressed
2 research questions: (1) what are the perceived barriers to
adolescent depression care as reported by adolescents (with
and without depression) and their parents? and (2) are fewer
perceived barriers associated with use of depression treat-
ments (counseling and antidepressants) for adolescents with
depression during the 6 months after depression is detected?
METHODS
Settings and Participants
Data are from 368 adolescents aged 13 to 17 (184
depressed and 184 nondepressed) and 338 of their paired
parents who participated in the Teen Depression Awareness
Project (TDAP). TDAP was designed to study the impact of
depression on adolescent and family functioning and the
effect of a motivational intervention on care for depression in
primary care settings. We conducted the study in collaboration
with 7 primary care health care organizations in Los Angeles
and Washington DC (3 of these sites each had more than 1
participating medical ofﬁce for a total of 11; 2 contributed no
patients, yielding data from 9). We selected these clinic partners
because they represent a wide range of public and private
healthcare settings that deliver care to teens from diverse back-
grounds.
Adolescent and Parent Recruitment
Teens visiting primary care medical ofﬁces and 1 of
their parents were recruited to participate in the study from
January 2005 through March 2006. Teens and parents were
approached in waiting rooms and recruited into the study
sequentially within each site. Teens and parents were pro-
vided information about the study, and those who consented
(in-person if present at the time of the visit or by phone and
mail) were subsequently contacted by phone and completed
an eligibility/diagnostic interview. All depressed teens and a
nondepressed matched sample were asked to continue to
participate in the longitudinal study, and to complete a base-
line computer-assisted telephone interview. Eligibility for the
study included current school attendance within 2 years of
expected grade level, currently living with parent/guardian,
not currently pregnant, English-speaking, and not having a
sibling enrolled in the study.
Teens were assessed via telephone for participation in
the project using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Chil-
dren35–37 depression module. Teens who met criteria for
depression were invited to participate further in the study. We
deﬁned teens as “depressed” if they met criteria for a depres-
sive episode of 2 weeks or more in the prior 6 months, and
reported at least 3 depressive symptoms in the prior 2 weeks.
We deﬁned teens as “nondepressed” if they reported 2 or
fewer symptoms in the prior 6 months. Teens who were
between these 2 levels of depression were deﬁned as “sub-
threshold” and were thanked for their participation, but not
invited to continue in the study. After a depressed teen was
enrolled, the next teen that screened as nondepressed from the
same clinic and of the same gender was invited to participate,
yielding matched pairs of depressed and nondepressed teens
by clinic and gender. One parent or legal guardian of each
participating teen was also invited to participate in the study;
in nearly all cases, this was the parent who provided consent
for the teen to participate.
Participating teens and parents were interviewed at
baseline and 6 months after the baseline assessment (August
2005 through September 2006) and compensated for time and
efforts associated with participation. Spanish-speaking par-
ents were provided materials in Spanish. A total of 5687 teens
expressed interest in the study, and 5084 assented to partic-
ipate and received parent consent. Of these, 4856 completed
a full screening assessment, and 4710 of these teens were
eligible for the study. This recruitment strategy resulted in
equal numbers of depressed and nondepressed teens from
each clinic (roughly matching on demographic, insurance,
and socioeconomic factors) and in a similar gender ratio in
the 2 groups (n  368, response rate 368/375 eligible 
98%). Figure 1 illustrates the sample ﬂow. All study proce-
dures were approved by the RAND IRB and the IRB’s of
collaborating health care organizations.
TDAP Intervention
All participating teens in both the depressed and non-
depressed groups, and their parents, received an educational
brochure about depression in teens. After depression was
detected via the diagnostic telephone interview and baseline
interviews were completed, teens, parents, and clinicians
were all informed that the teen was likely depressed. A
random half of teens with depression were contacted to
participate in a motivational interview that encouraged them
to think through next steps in understanding and getting help
for their depression, seeking to move teens from considering
depression care to acceptance of care and ultimately, to actual
treatment. These teens were also sent a guide to local mental
health resources. However, as the 2 groups of depressed teens
did not differ from one another in terms of subsequent use of
mental health services, they are considered together for the
purposes of this article.
Measures
Barriers to Care
Teen perceived barriers to care were assessed in the
baseline interviews with questions adapted from several stud-
ies of depression in primary care among adults38 and teens.39
Teens were asked to imagine that they needed or wanted care
for emotional or personal problems 6 months in the future.
Then they were asked to rate 7 barriers on a 5-point Likert
agreement scale with “I might not get care because . . .” as
the stem to each statement: (1) it would cost too much, (2) of

what others might think, (3) of difﬁculties ﬁnding or making
an appointment with a doctor or therapist, (4) of problems
that come up due to my personal responsibilities at school,
home, or work, (5) I wouldn’t want my family to ﬁnd out
about my depression (asked of teens only), (6) there isn’t
good care available to me, and (7) I just don’t want to. We
report these barriers individually and also using an aggregate
scale derived by summing across all items. We created 2
scale versions for teens: 1 with all 7 items (Cronbach’s  
0.79) and another with only the 6 parallel items asked of both
teens and their parents (Cronbach’s   0.75). The 6-item
parent perceived barriers scale (Cronbach’s   0.83) was
scored identically to the teen version.
To complement the quantitative data on perceived bar-
riers, we conducted 45-minute telephone interviews with a
purposive sample of 16 teen-parent dyads (75% of teens and
parents called) after baseline assessment and delivery of the
motivational interview. Dyads were selected to include ap-
proximately equal numbers spanning the 2 study locations,
the 2 intervention arms, teen gender and ethnicity, and
whether or not the teen had previously received treatment.
The semi-structured interview included questions about bar-
riers to, experience with, and receipt of care.
Use of Treatments for Depression
We assessed teens’ receipt of depression treatment
during the 6 months between identiﬁcation of the depression
(baseline assessment) and the follow-up assessment using 6
binary indicators representing receipt of counseling and use
of antidepressant medications or some combination of the 2.
Any use of counseling for depression was deﬁned as positive
if a teen reported having received counseling or therapy for
personal or emotional problems from a mental health special-
ist like a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker or family
counselor in a mental health clinic or ofﬁce, and that at least
one of the counseling visits was related to their feeling sad or
depressed. We also speciﬁed a more conservative measure,
any use of depression counseling with the added criterion of
having received at least 4 counseling sessions. This opera-
tionalization has been used in other studies in primary care
settings.40 We deﬁned any use of an antidepressant as positive
if a teen reported using any antidepressant for depression and
also examined a more conservative measure of antidepressant
use for at least 1 month in the last 6 months. We refer to these
stricter measures as “regular” use compared with “any” use. We
also looked at any depression treatment (any depression coun-
seling or use of antidepressants for depression) and regular
depression treatment (at least 4 counseling visits or antidepres-
sants for at least 1 month in the past 6 months).
Covariates
We created binary indicators for teen gender, race/
ethnicity (white vs. nonwhite), and insurance type (private vs.
public or none) with male, nonwhite and public/no insurance
speciﬁed as the reference categories in the models.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses focused on the association between baseline
perceived barriers data (collected before to implementation of
the motivational interview intervention) and use of treatments
for depression at follow-up. We performed bivariate descrip-
tive analyses to present the percent reporting different types
of perceived barriers for teens and their parents stratiﬁed by
depression status using the whole sample. We used bivariate
analyses (cross-tabs with  statistics) to assess consistency
between linked teen and parent reports. We also stratiﬁed
these analyses by depression for the whole sample. Speciﬁ-
cally, for each barrier, we calculated the percent of teens for
whom both the teen and parent reported that they “somewhat
agreed” or “strongly agreed” that it was a barrier.
We also examined the relationship between perceived
barriers and use of treatments for depression measured at the

6-month follow-up interview among depressed teens. We
present unadjusted bivariate treatment rates and adjusted
multivariable logistic regression analyses to evaluate that
relationship after adjusting for intracluster correlation among
clients within treatment site41 and the covariates. SAS PROC
GLIMMIX42 was used to adjust for clustering in the models
by accommodating study clinic as a random effect. We
examined the effect of teen and parent perceived barriers, the
difference between their perceptions, and also the moderating
effect of teen barriers on service use indirectly through parent
perceptions. We present the adjusted odds ratios and 95%
conﬁdence intervals for each model coefﬁcient including the
standardized score for the perceived barriers scales to illus-
trate the effect on each measure of treatment use.
The rate of missing information per variable was very
low, with 22 (13%) teens with missing data on at least 1
measure used in our multivariable models. Missing data were
imputed using multivariate normal-based multiple imputation
as implemented by SAS PROC MI to impute missing data at
the item level. The bivariate and multivariate analyses were
repeated on 5 imputed datasets and results were combined
using standard multiple imputation rules43,44 as implemented
in SAS PROC MIANALYZE to obtain parameter estimates
and their adjusted standard errors that accounted for the
uncertainty due to imputation. Of the 184 teen respondents,
162 were eligible for multivariate analyses because parent
data were also available. Of these, 162 respondents, 16 (10%)
had at least 1 missing predictor variable.
RESULTS
Teen and Parent Characteristics
Table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics of
study teens and parents. Teens averaged 15.2 years of age
were mostly female (78%) and predominantly black (32.7%)
or Hispanic (49.3%). Parents averaged 43.8 years of age were
also mostly women (89.1%) and predominantly black
(33.9%) or Hispanic (45.8%). Forty-six percent of the parents
had at least some college education and 37.9% reported
household incomes of at least $50,000. The majority of
parents had more than 1 child or adult living in the household
(60.7% and 79.6%, respectively) and were married (55.9%).
Perceived Barriers
Table 2 shows the mean and standard deviation for the
aggregate perceived barriers scale and the percent of teens
and parents reporting that they “strongly agreed” or “some-
what agreed” with each of the perceived barriers items. These
data are stratiﬁed by whether or not the teen was depressed.
There is a clear and consistent pattern that depressed teens are
signiﬁcantly more likely to perceive barriers to care com-
pared with nondepressed teens. For parents, this pattern is
less pronounced with signiﬁcant differences only for the cost
and access items as well as for the overall scale.
The qualitative interviews among a subgroup of teens
with depression provide a more in-depth picture of the spe-
ciﬁc barriers reported in this study. The most often mentioned
barriers for teens and parents were that other responsibilities
at school, recreational activities, needing to baby-sit for other
children, or difﬁculty getting time off work made it difﬁcult
to get care (mentioned by 12 of 16 teens). Perceived stigma
was also a concern (mentioned by 4 teens). Speciﬁcally, they
were not comfortable talking with anyone about their feel-
ings. Access was another type of barrier mentioned by several
teens and parents with lack of transportation, long distance to
the clinic, or hours the counselor is available. Three parents
and 2 teens discussed reluctance to take antidepressants or

difﬁculty adhering to them and 2 teens mentioned that they
preferred counseling. A few parents also noted insurance
coverage problems.
Patterns of concordance between teens and their parents
in their perceptions of each of the 6 perceived barriers are
shown in Table 3. Concordance is low on nearly all barriers
for teens with and without depression.  statistics are near-
zero for all barriers except access (“trouble making an ap-
pointment” with a  of 0.21) among the nondepressed teens.
However, agreement was slightly higher among the de-
pressed group (3.0%–6.6% for nondepressed teen dyads and
4.7%–12.9% for depressed teen dyads).
Relationship Between Barriers and Use of
Treatments Among Depressed Teens
Overall, 55% of the depressed teens reported receiving
any depression counseling and even fewer (26%) received at
least 4 counseling sessions during the 6 months after depres-
sion was identiﬁed. Fewer than 1 in 5 teens with depression
(17%) reported receiving an antidepressant medication and
only 7% reported regular antidepressant use (regular use for
at least 1 month in the past 6). The percent of depressed teens
receiving any treatment was 56%, and 29% received any
regular treatment. There are bivariate associations (Table 4)
between 3 of the 7 teen perceived barriers and their reported
use of counseling and/or antidepressants 6 months following
baseline. Teens who perceived stigma (about what others
might think) were less likely to report use any antidepressants
or any treatment and there was a trend toward less use across
all of the treatment measures. Stigma about family’s percep-
tions was also consistently associated with lower use of
depression treatment. Perceiving that good quality care is not
available was associated with less use of counseling and
treatment. Barriers reported by teens concerning cost, access,
other responsibilities, or not wanting care were unrelated to
use of treatments for depression.
In multivariate analyses, we found no effect for parent
perceptions either directly or as a mediator of teen perceptions
and therefore present data only for the teen barriers (Table 5).
Teens with higher scores on the perceived barriers scale had a
signiﬁcantly lower odds of receiving an antidepressant (P 
0.01), of receiving a regular course of antidepressant therapy
(P  0.001), and of receiving any regular treatment, whether
counseling or medication (P  0.05). There were a few effects
for the covariates; nonminority white teens were more likely to
report using an antidepressant (any or regular) and any regular
treatment. Girls and the privately insured were less likely to
report a regular course of antidepressants.
DISCUSSION
In this study of teens with and without depression
sampled from primary care medical ofﬁces, perceptions of
barriers were common, particularly for those with depression.
Teens and their parents’ perceptions of barriers were discor-
dant, and teens with depression who reported more barriers
were less likely to receive care. Prior studies30,42 have exam-

the consistency of teen and parent perceptions of barriers to
depression treatment and the association of barriers with use

Given the wide endorsement of barriers by teens (in-
cluding stigma), it may be especially important for PCCs to
discuss treatment reluctance and treatment preferences with
teens themselves, and ultimately with both the teen and
parent. Speciﬁcally, better understanding the reasons for the
teen’s reluctance and preferences can help move the teen
toward feeling comfortable with treatment options, and in-
volving parents in such discussions will help parents under-
stand teen’s feelings and facilitate parents’ role in supporting
subsequent treatment or referral to a mental health specialist.
Enhancing PCC skills for addressing teen concerns may be a
promising strategy for engaging more teens to accept depres-
sion treatment. However, parents and teens also perceived
external barriers such as cost, poor access, and resistance to
obtaining care. This suggests that, in addition to enhanced
PCC communication skills, broader efforts to expand access
to services are needed. These broader efforts include public
education and outreach and eliminating ﬁnancing barriers.
The greater endorsement of barriers among depressed
teens may reﬂect negative cognitive biases (eg, helplessness,
hopelessness) associated with the experience of depression.
In contrast, perceived barriers reported by parents of de-
pressed teens were similar to the barriers reported by parents
of nondepressed teens. One explanation for this contrast is
that parents perceptions are unaffected by their teens depres-
sion and thus could serve as an important leverage point or
“reality check” for their teens, who see many obstacles to
receiving care. An alternative explanation for this pattern is
that parents are “out-of-touch” with the issues their teens are
facing, and that depressed teens have more accurate, experi-
ential-based perceptions of barriers.
We found little consistency between teens and their par-
ents’ with regard to perceived barriers especially for the de-
pressed group suggesting that PCCs should target communica-
tions about how to seek care both with the teen and the parent,
since they are concerned about different barriers, and talking
with just one will not cover the diverse issues that might get in
the way of the teen receiving care. This ﬁnding, of the impor-
tance for PCCs to communicate with the family (teen and
parent), is consistent with other work that has found that the
family plays a signiﬁcant role in provider motivation to treat.45
Teens who reported more barriers were less likely to
receive any regular treatment for depression 6 months later.
Although reduced odds of receiving counseling were not signif-
icant, receipt of antidepressant medications and any regular
treatment were signiﬁcantly lower. Teens may perceive more
barriers to taking medications because of the desire to feel
normal and concerns about losing their identities eg, if they take
a pill, they must be sick,33 or because of concerns about side
effects, such as weight gain and also stigma about medication in
particular. This could explain the stronger association between
perceived barriers and use of antidepressants.
The ﬁnding that girls and those with private insurance
were less likely to receive a regular course of antidepressants
was counterintuitive. Consistent with previous explana-
tions,31 it is possible that public insurance plans provide
better coverage for antidepressant medications than some
private plans. Another explanation is that side effects of many
commonly used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, for
example, weight gain may be associated with lower accep-
tance of medication among girls. However, additional re-
search would be needed to test these hypotheses.
Study limitations include reliance on self-reports of
barriers because reports by those with no treatment-seeking
experience may be less accurate. These perceptions, even if
inaccurate, are important, however, as moving from not
getting treatment toward being ready to seek and eventually
to receive treatment is the goal. In fact, all depressed teens
and their parents received feedback about depression regard-
less of whether they were seeking treatment. Thus, although
ﬁndings may not generalize to all treatment seekers, they do
generalize to depressed teens who are aware of their symp-
toms. Our estimates of which barriers were most problematic
are conservative given that teens with depression (and their
parents) report more barriers to care. In addition, we relied on
self-reported assessment of service use. Although self-re-
ported survey measures of service use in the past 6 months
have previously been used in studies of teens, the accuracy of
these reports relative to medical records is not known. An-
other limitation is that teens with more prevalent depression
and/or previous treatment experience may be more likely to
report barriers, particularly as a means for refusing care. Our
sample size limited the power for detecting associations with
service utilization, particularly since treatment rates were
low. The sample size also restricted the number of covariates
that could be examined in multivariate models even after
missing values were imputed. We selected health care orga-
nizations serving a diverse patient population with particular
ethnic and minority groups in 2 geographic areas, which may
not represent other areas of the country. Our study was
restricted to teens recruited from primary care waiting rooms,
which may under-represent adolescents who tend not to be
regular users of health care. Finally, we did not obtain infor-
mation about the teen’s insurance and it is possible that some
uninsured parents have patients with public insurance (eg,
through the State Children’s Health Insurance Plan or SCHIP).
Depression is a serious threat to adolescent health and its
identiﬁcation and treatment are public health priorities. National
surveys and guidelines ﬁnd that depression is common among
US students in grades 9 through 1246 and call for the identiﬁ-
cation of adolescents at increased risk for suicide including those
experiencing depressive symptoms. Effective treatments have
been developed for the primary care setting.39,47 Ongoing efforts
seek to improve depression screening tools and reduce burdens
on PCCs.48 Understanding perceived barriers can inform these
efforts to improve depression care.
The adult depression literature suggests that patient-
centered communication strategies that elicit patients’ values
and preferences for treatment of depression and helping
engage patients into care can lead to improved outcomes.49,50
This patient-centered approach may also be relevant for teens
with depression particularly because teens tend to be less
involved in medical decisions. In addition, like adults, the
teens in this study, who are receiving care mostly from PCCs,
may be selectively more averse to care for depression. There-
fore, PCCs treating adolescent depression must gain patient

trust and ensure that patients fully understand recommended
treatments; otherwise, adherence with treatment and associ-
ated positive outcomes will be limited. Our ﬁndings highlight
the importance of PCCs engaging in conversations that di-
rectly address both teen’s and their parents concerns, needs,
and priorities for depression care.
