ABSTRACT
Objective: To examine the relationship of depressive and disruptive disorders with patterns of mental health services util-
ization in a community sample of child ren and adolescents. Method: Data were from the NIMH Methods for the
Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA) Study.The sample consisted of 1,285 child (ages 9-17
years) and parenVguardian pairs. Data included child psychopatho logy (assessed by the Diagnostic Interview Schedule
for Children), impairment, child need and use of mental health services, and family socioeconomic status. Results: After
adjusting for potential confounding factors, disruptive disorder was significantly associated with children's use of mental
health services , but depressive disorder was nol. For school-based services , no difference was found between the 2 types
of disorders. Parents perceived greater need for mental health services for children with disruptive disorders than for those
with depression. Conversely, depression was more related to children's perception of mental health service need than was
disruptive disorder. Conclusions: The findings highlight the need for more effective ways to identify and refer depressed
children to mental health professionals, the importa nce of lrnprovinq school-based services to meet children's needs, and
the necessity to better educate parents and teachers regarding the identification of psychiatric disorders, especially
depression. J. Am. Acad. Child Ado/esc. Psychiatry, 1999, 38(9):1081-1090. KeyWords: depression , disruptive disorder,
mental health service utilization, perceived need, school-based services.
Depression is one of the leading risk factors for suicide
in children and adolescents (Brent et al., 1993; Shaffer
et al., 1996b), as well as a source of serious distress and
impairment (Weissman et al., 1991). Improving the
early identification and treatment ofyouths with depres-
sion, therefore, has both clinical and policy implications.

Identifying the patterns of service use or nonuse in this
vulnerable population is the first step to improving men-
tal health services. There has been limited research in
this specific area, and consequently little is known about
the service use patterns of children and adolescents with
depressive disorders in the community.
Many children with a need for mental health services
do not receive professional help (Burns, 1991; Burns
et al., 1995; Costello, 1989; Gould et al., 1980; Staghezza-
Jaramillo et al., 1995; Whitaker et al., 1990) or appro-
priate services (Saxe et al., 1988). However, few studies
have examined the relationship between types ofpsychiat-
ric disorders and patterns of serviceutilization (Anderson
et al., 1987; Cohen et al., 1991; Cuffe et al., 1995; Koot
and Verhulst, 1992; Verhulst and Ende, 1997). The find-
ings are also inconsistent. For example, some studies
found that children with "externalizing" disorders, such
as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct dis-
order, and oppositional defiant disorder are more likely

WU ET AL.
to be referred to and to use mental health services than
children without these disorders. On the other hand,
«internalizing" disorders, such as depression and anxiety,
are not generally associated with service use (Anderson
et al., 1987; Cohen et al., 1991; Koot and Verhulst, 1992).
In Verhulst and Ende's recent study in the Netherlands
(1997), both externalizing and internalizing problems
made unique contributions to service use. However, the
effect of externalizing disorders was stronger than that of
the internalizing disorders. Studies also found that
impairment had an impact on child use of mental health
services, which is independent of the psychiatric dis-
orders (Bird et al., 1996; Leaf et al., 1996; Staghezza-
Jaramillo et al., 1995).
Besides the type of disorder and impairment, some
characteristics of family, parent, and youth have been
.found to affectchild serviceutilization patterns, including
the child'sage (Barber et al., 1992; Cohen and Hesselbart,
1993; Zahner and Daskalakis, 1997), gender (Barber
et al., 1992; Cuffe et al., 1995; Garralda and Bailey, 1988;
Zahner and Daskalakis, 1997), ethnicity (Cohen and
Hesselbart, 1993; Cuffe et al., 1995; Neighbors et al.,
1992; Zahner and Daskalakis, 1997), family socioeco-
nomic status (Cohen and Hesselbart, 1993; Garralda and
Bailey, 1988;John et al., 1995; Koot and Verhulst, 1992),
child physical illness (john et al., 1995), parental use of
mental health servicesfor psychiatric problems (Garralda
and Bailey, 1988), and parental perceivedburden (Angold
et al., 1998). Inasmuch asmost of thesefactors are related
to disorders aswell asto serviceutilization, it is important
to control for them when assessing the relationship be-
tween type of disorder and patterns of service utilization.
In Andersen's model of health services utilization
among adults (Andersen, 1995; Andersen and Newman,
1973), an important determinant is the "need" for ser-
vices, which includes perceived need and evaluated need
(diagnosis). Children's pathways to mental health ser-
vices,however,are more complicated than those of adults
in that children do not usually decide to seek mental
health services.Others, usually parents and teachers, and
in some instances, other agents, such as the police
(Horwitz, 1982), play the most important role in both
identifying a child's mental health problems and obtain-
ing professional help. Their attitudes toward and percep-
tions of children's needs for serviceshave a major impact
on child service use decisions (Angold et al., 1998;
Costello andJaniszewski, 1990; Hoberman, 1992; Tarico
et al., 1989; Zahner and Daskalakis, 1997).
Recent studies have shown that more than three
fourths of children using mental health services were
seen in school, and for many of them the school-based
service is the only source of care received (Burns et al.,
1995; Leafet al., 1996; Staghezza-Jaramillo et al., 1995).
Perhaps for this reason, school-based health and mental
health centers continue to grow (Lear, 1996). Schools
provide a single point of access to services in a non-
threatening atmosphere and thus reduce the barriers to
children receiving help for emotional, behavioral, and
drug-related problems (Flaherty et al., 1996). However,
few studies have examined and compared the impact of
specific psychiatric disorder and risk factors on the utili-
zation of mental health services within or outside the
school setting (Angold et al., 1998; Koot and Verhulst,
1992; Zahner et al., 1992; Zahner and Daskalakis, 1997).
To examine the unmet needs of children with depres-
sive disorders, the service use patterns of depressed chil-
dren werecompared with those ofchildren with disruptive
disorders. These comparisons were conducted on chil-
dren's useofspecialty mental health services, school-based
services, as well as any service use for emotional, behav-
ioral, and drug-related problems. The analysis addresses
4 questions: (1) How do children with depressive disor-
ders receive mental health services? (2) Are the patterns
of service utilization the same for children with depres-
sive disorders as for those with disruptive disorders? (3)
If there are differences, do these differences exist for spe-
cialty mental health services, as well as school-based ser-
vices? (4) Finally, if there are differences, can they be
explained by demographic, familial, parental, and indi-
vidual characteristics or by perceived service needs?The
answers to these questions will provide a more thorough
understanding of the unmet needs of children with
depressive disorders, identify various factors affecting
children's use of mental health services, and provide cli-
nicians and policymakers with useful information to
help improve services for children in need, especially
those with depression.
METHOD
Sample and Data
Data were obtained in the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH)-funded Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and
Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA) Study (Dulcan, 1996; Lahey
et aI., 1996), a multisite communitysurvey conducted in 1992. Prob-
ability samples of children aged 9 to 17years were obtained in 4 geo-
graphicareas:(l ) Hamden, East Haven, and West Haven, Connecticut
(N = 314); (2) DeKalb, Rockdale, and Henry counties, Georgia (N =
1082

299); (3) Westchester County, New York (N = 360); and (4) San
Juan, Puerto Rico (N= 312).The 1,285 parent-child pairs interviewed
represented 84% of tho se eligible (Lahey et al., 1996). Fifty-three
percent of the sample were boys, and the mean age of the children in
the sample was 12.9 years (SD = 2.6).
Structured, in-person interviews were conducted in families' homes
separately for parents and children. The protocol included the NIMH
D iagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DI SC) Version 2.3
(Shaffer er al., 1996a) and a Service Utilization and Risk Factors inter-
view (Goodman et al., 1998; Leafer al., 1996).
Measures of Service Utilization for Child Emotional,
Behavioral, or Drug Use Problems
All parents and children were asked about mental health and sub-
stance use services used by children, both in the previous year as well
as in their lifetime. However, only parents were asked about chil-
dren's use of specific types of services (Leaf et al.,1996). On the basis
of information from both parents and children, the following 3 types
ofservice utilization in lifetime and past year were used in this study:
MentalHealthServices. A child was seen by a psychiatrist, psychol-
ogist, or counselor in his/her private office, or received treatment in a
psychiatric or drug and alcohol outpatient clinic, or stayed overnight
in a hospital or residential treatment center for psychiatric or sub-
stance use problems.
School-BasedMentalHealth Services.A child used school-based ser-
vicesfor emotional, behavioral, and/or drug use problems.The services
include both individual counseling and special classesor programs.
Any Service. A child used any of the following services for emo-
tional or behavioral problems or alcohol or drug use: (1) mental
health services, (2) medical professionals, (3) school-based services,
(4) social services, (5) clergy,or (6) other (e.g., spiritualists, herbalists).
Service Need Recognition
Parent and child perceptions of the child's need for services for
emotional, behavioral, and/or drug problems were based on their
own reports. Teacher's perceptions of the child's service need and
police contact (for anyth ing but minor traffic violations) were based
on reports from either parent or child.
Measures of Child Characteristics
Psychiatric Disorders and Impairment. Children's psychopathology
in the previous 6 months was assessed by the DISC (version 2.3) .
Aggregated data from both parent and child interviews were used,
that is, a diagnosis was considered to be positive if symptoms reported
by the parent and/or the child, when combined, met diagnostic crite-
ria. Impairment was included in the definition of each psychiatric
disorder. In this study, a child was considered to have positive results
for any disorder when (1) DSM-III-R criteria for that disorder were
met, (2) there was an indication of diagnosis-specific imp airment,
and (3) either parent or child interviewer ratings on the nonclinician
Global Assessment Scale for Children were below 71 (Shaffer et al.,
1996a). Depressive disorders included major depression and dysthy-
mia. Disruptive behavior disorders included attention-deficit hyper-
activity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder.
Any otherdisorders included any of 24 other disorders assessed by the
DISC (Shaffer er al., 1996a).
The Columbia Impairment Scale is a 13-item scale covering inter-
personal relations and funct ioning at work, in school, and at home.
Items are scored from 0 ("no problem") to 4 ("a vety bad problem")
(Bird et al., 1993, 1996). The internal reliability of the scale is 0.83.
DEPRESSION AND MENTAL HE ALTH SERVICE USE
The scale was based on both parent and child reports and was dichoto-
mized at the optimal threshold ~6 recommended by Bird et al. (1996)
to distingu ish between those with definite impairment and all others.
PhysicalIllness. Thirteen childhood illnesses such as diabetes, heart
disease, asthma, allergy, and others were included in the parent
report. A dichotomized variable was created with two or more types
of illnesses coded as 1 and none or one as O.
ChildDemographics. Child demograph ics include gender, age, and
ethnicity. Children were divided into 4 ethnic groups: non-Hispanic
white, African-American, Hispanic, and other. Three dummy-coded
variables-African-American, Hispanic, and other-were created for
logistic regression analyses with non-Hispanic white as the reference
group.
Measures of Familial and Parental Characteristics
Low family income was defined as receiving public assistance or
having an annual household income of less than $18 ,000 (1 SD
below the mean) for the 3 U.S. sites. Because income in Puerto Rico
was considerably lower th an at the other 3 sites, low income in
Puerto Rico was defined as receiving public assistance or having an
annual household income of less than $4,000 (1 SD below the mean
of Puerto Rico). Mo ther's education was dichotomized with 13 or
more years of schooling coded as 1 in the analysis. Information about
family insurance coverage (either private or public, such as Medicaid
or Medicare) was obtained from parents. Mothers' or fathers' use of
mental health services was determined by having "ever seen a psychi-
atr ist, psychologist, social worker, doctor, or other health profes-
sional, for a psychological or emotional problem."
Analysis
Univariate analyses compared the service use patterns, identified
need for services, and child and family characteristics of depressed
children and children with disruptive behavior disorders..Because
comorbidity existed between the 2 types of disorders, children who
had either type of disorder were divided into 3 groups : (1) depressive
only (n = 44), (2) disruptive only (n = 96), and (3) both depressive
and disruptive disorders (n = 36). Children without any disorder (n =
1,016) served as a reference group.
LOgistic regression analyses predicting child mental health service
use were conducted for the total sample in 5 steps. In each model,
study site, mother's education, family income, health insurance status,
and child's age, sex, and ethnicity were controlled. In model I, depres-
sivedisorder was entered into the equation. In model 2, disruptive dis-
order was entered into the equation. In model 3, both depressive and
disruptive disorders were simultaneously entered to take comorbidity
into account.The odds ratio for each disorder shows the effect of one
disorder while controlling for the effect of the other. In model 4, all
variables in model 3, plus child's other psychiatric disorders, impair-
ment, and lifetime chronic physical illnesses, were simultaneously
entered so we could examine the unique contribution of depressiveor
disruptive disorders while controlling for other mental and physical ill-
nesses as well as impairment. Finally, model 5 added perceived need,
police contact, and parental use of mental health services into the
equation. These latter variables were entered into the model so we
could examine whether recognition of child psychopathology by par-
ent and others is related to service use and whether the difference
between depressive and disruptive disorders was due to the fact that
children with disruptive disorders were more easily identified and
labeled as being in need of help than those with depressive disorders.
The differences among the 4 sites in the MECA study have been
previously discussed (Lahey et al., 1996). In all the logistic regression

analyses, the effect ofsire was controlled. Also, the interactions ofsire
with depressive disorders, disruptive disorders, and important demo-
graphic variables were added to the final model to examine whether
the main findings still held .
RESULTS
Univariate Analyses
Individual and family characteristics were first com-
pared among children with depressive but not disrup-
tive disorders (n = 44), children with disruptive but not
depressive disorders (n =96), children with both disor-
ders (n =36), and those without any disorder (n = 1,016)
(Table 1).
The ethnic distribution of the Disruptive Only group
was significantly different from that of the No Disorder
group. Therewere more African-Americans and fewer
Hispanics in me Disruptive Only group than in the No
Disorder group: Children with depressive disorders
tended to be older (mean age = 14.3) than those without
depression (12.9 in the No Disorder group and 12.6 in
the Disruptive Only group). As expected, more girls met
criteria for depression and more boys met criteria for dis-
ruptive disorders. Fifty-nine percent of children with
depression only and 31% of children in the Disruptive
Only group were girls. Among children with either
depressive or disruptive disorders or both disorders, a
high proportion of children (more than 60%) also met
criteria for other disorders. Children with either depres-
sive or disruptive disorders were also more likely to be
impaired than those with no disorder. Finally, children
with both depressive and disruptive disorders were most
likely to be impaired (67%). No significant difference
was found on physical illnesses across groups.
The comparison of family and parental characteristics
across groups showed that the mothers of children with
both depressive and disruptivedisordershad lesseducation

than mothers in other groups. Mothers' rates of mental
health service use were higher in the Depressive Only
group and Disruptive Only group than in the No Disorder
group. No significant differences were found in income,
health insurance, or fathers' use of mental health services.
Table 2 shows children's service use patterns by type
of disorder. For both lifetime and past year service use,
children with either one or both disorders used more ser-
vices than those with no disorder. For lifetime service
use, children with disruptive disorder, whether they had
a depressive disorder or not (Disruptive Only and Both
groups), were more likely to report receiving mental
health services(56.1%) than those in the DepressiveOnly
group (38.6%). However, this pattern was not found in
school-based service use. For service use in the past year,
no significant difference was found among children with
different types of disorders.
One explanation of the findings in Table 2 may be
that children with disruptive disorders are more likely to
use mental health servicesbecause they (or their parents)
perceive greater need for servicesthan those with depres-
sive disorders. To test this hypothesis, the perceived
needs for services were compared among children with
different disorders (Table 3). As we expected, signifi-
cantly higher rates of service need recognition by par-
ents, teachers, and children themselves were found in
children with either or both disorders than those with
no disorder. Also, children with either or both disorders
were more likely to report police contact than those with
no disorder. Parents of children with disruptive dis-
orders (with or without depressive disorder) were more
likely to perceive child service need (51.5%) than those
with depressive disorder only (36.4%). The highest rate
of parent-perceived need was found in children with
both depressive and disruptive disorders (61.1%), and a
similar pattern was found for police contact. However, a
different pattern was found for child-perceived mental
health service need. Children with depressive disorders
(with or without disruptive disorders) were more likely
to perceive a need for services (35.0%) than those with
disruptive disorders only (22.9%). No significant differ-
ence was found between the 2 disorders for teachers' per-
ceived need (reported by parents and children).
Multivariate Analysis
To explore further the relationship between types of
disorders and service use, we conducted logistic regres-
sion analyses to assess the effect of each specific category
of disorder, adjusting for the effects ofother factors. The
results are summarized in Table 4.
MentalHealth Services. The resultsfor mental health ser-
vice use show striking differences between depressive and
disruptive disorders. When the 2 types of disorders were
entered into the equation (model 3), the adjusted odds
ratio (AOR) for disruptive disorders (6.05, p < .001) was
about 3 times that for depressive disorders (2.00, p < .05).

WU ET AL.
Results in model 4 showed that impairment, other psychi-
atric disorders, and chronic illness were also significantly
associated with child mental health service use. Control-
ling for them, the AOR for disruptive disorder reduced to
4.01 (p< .001), while depressive disorders were no longer
significantly related to mental health service use (AOR =
1.35). ModelS assumes that children with disruptive dis-
orders are more easily identified and labeled as being in
need of help. If this assumption is true, the effect of dis-
ruptive disorders on service use will disappear or diminish
after control for perception of child service need. The
effect of disruptive disorders still held in this final model
(AOR = 3.44,P < .001). Also significantly associated with
child mental health service use were child physical illness;
mother's lifetime mental health service use; perceived child
mental health service need by children, parents, and
teachers; and police contact. In addition, African-American
children were less likely than whites to use mental health
services (AOR = 0.57, P < .05). Older children (15 or
older) were more likely to use services than younger ones
(9-11 years old) (AOR = 1.78, P< .05).
School-BasedServices. No difference between the effects
of depressive and disruptive disorders was found on
school-based mental health service use. For example, in
model 3, theAOR was 3.14 (p < .001) for disruptive dis-
orders and 2.88 (p< .001) for depressive disorders. When
all the other factors were controlled (model 5), neither of
the 2 disorders remained significant. Teacher-perceived
need is the strongest predictor of school-based service use
(AOR = 3.90, P < .001), followed by child-perceived
(AOR = 2.65, P< .001) and parent-perceived need (AOR =
2.18) for mental health services.
Any Service Use. The findings for use of any services
were quite similar to those for mental health service use,
although the difference between depressive and disrup-
tive disorders was not as striking. In the final model (5),
the effects of depressive disorder became nonsignificant
(AOR = 1.69), while the effects of disruptive disorders
still held (AOR = 2.55,p < .01).
The stronger effect of disruptive disorders on mental
health service utilization than depressive disorders was
found for lifetime service use only, and thus it is possible
that this difference was due to the greater chronicity of
disruptive disorders. Using age of onset of each disorder
reported by both parent and child, we created a proxy of
the "duration" for each disorder and conducted addi-
tional analyses to control for the duration of disorders.
The results indicate that the difference between the 2
types of disorders still held.
In addition to controlling for site effect in each model,
we also conducted analyses with interactions of site with
depressive, disruptive, and some important sociodem-
ographic variablescontrolled. The results showed no signif-
icant interaction, and the main findings remained the same.
DISCUSSION
This study examines the effects of disorders, primarily
depression and disruptive disorders, on the use ofservices
for emotional, behavioral, and/or drug-related problems
by children and adolescents in a community sample.

The results of the study highlight the unmet service
needs of children with depressive disorders and indicate
possible ways to meet their needs.
Unmet Needs of Children With Depressive Disorders
In contrast to children with disruptive disorders, chil-
dren with depressivedisorders are lesslikely to receivespe-
cialty mental health services. This is especially true for
those with depressive disorders alone. This pattern sug-
gests that children with internalizing problems are under-
identified or underreferred. The pattern we observed is
consistent with findings from other studies (Anderson
et al., 1987; Cohen er al., 1991; Koot and Verhulst, 1992).
However, this studj went beyond the previous studies in

WU ET AL.
several aspects. Unlike the studies of Anderson et al.
(1987) and Cohen et al. (1991), this study took cornor-
bidity between depressive and disruptive disorders into
account. Also, different from Koot and Verhulst's study
(1992), this study used DSM-III-R criteria, measured by
the DISC, to assess child psychopathology. Finally, addi-
tional potential confounding variables, such as impair-
ment, perceived needs, physical illness, and parental
mental health serviceuse, were controlled for in our mul-
tivariate analyses. Logistic regression analyseswere con-
ducted hierarchicallyto determine whether the difference
between the 2 typesofdisorderscould be explained by the
effects of other disorders; by level of impairment; by
familial, parental, and irldividual characteristics; or by
perceived child service needs. The results indicate that
after controlling all the confounding factors, children
with disruptive disorders still appeared to be more likely .
to use mental health services than children without dis-
ruptive disorders, while the presence of depressive dis-
orders was not associated with receiving mental health
services. The findings from testing the multiple-step
model indicate that the effects of child psychiatric dis-
orders on child mental health serviceuseare partiallyindi-
rect, being mediated through impairment and perceived
needs. When impairment was entered into the equation,
it contributed significantly to mental health service use
and reduced the effectofdisorders.When perceivedmen-
tal health serviceneedswereentered into the equation, the
effectof impairment became insignificant.
Another unique aspect of our analysis is that, in
addition to service use, we compared perceived need for
services among children with different disorders. The
results showed that, while depressed children used
mental health services less, they acrually reported more
need for services than those with disruptive disorders.
These findings further highlight the unmet need of
depressed children.
School-Based Mental Health Service
A comparison between children's use of non-school-
based mental health services and their use of school-
based services shows that, after control for familial,
parental, and individual factors, the difference between
the effectof disruptive disorders and depressivedisorders
on serviceuse is significant regarding the use of specialty
mental services, but not for the use of school-based ser-
vices. Moreover, the findings suggestthat children's use of
school-based services is less likely than use of mental
health services outside of school to be influenced by
demographic and parental factors. Ethnicity, child's age,
and maternal use of mental health services are signifi-
cantly associatedwith child mental health serviceuse but
have no effect on use of school services. These findings
are consistent with those reported in other studies which
showed that school-based services are most widely used
by children and adolescents and are easier to access
(Burns et al., 1995; Flaherty et al., 1996; Lear, 1996;
Staghezza-Jaramillo et al., 1995). These results suggest
that unlike children's use of specialty mental health ser-
vices, children with depressivedisorders did not appear to
have more difficulties in accessing school services for
their emotional and behavioral problems. Therefore,
expanding and improving school-based mental health
services can be potentially helpful in meeting the specific
needs of depressed children and adolescents.
Role of Parents and Teachers
Consistent with previous studies (Angold et al., 1998;
Costello and Janiszewski, 1990; Zahner and Daskalakis,
1997), our findings indicate the importance of parents
and teachers in initiating children's use of mental health
services.Teacher's perception of child service needs was
strongly associatedwith the use of both school and non-
school mental health services. Parents' perceived needs
had a stronger impact on children receiving mental
health services outside ofschool than on receipt ofschool
services. In our final model, when the perceived needs
were entered into the equation, with the exception of dis-
ruptive disorder, the effects of psychopathology and .
impairment on serviceusedisappeared.These findings are
similarto those reported byAngoldand colleagues (1998).
Limitations and Strengths of the Study
It should be noted that the conclusions drawn from
this study are limited in several ways. First, because of
the cross-sectional design of the MECA study, we can-
not address pathways to mental health services and no
causal relationships can be determined regarding service
use and perceived service need. A longitudinal study is
necessary to confirm these findings. Also, while the anal-
yses were conducted on service utilization, no conclu-
sion can be made about the effectiveness of the services
offered or received. However, the largesizeof the MECA
sample, the detail of the psychiatric disorders measured
by the NIMH DISC, and the rich information on ser-
vice utilization for mental health problems gave us a
1088

wonderful opportunity to explore the pattern of service
utilization and the need for mental health services for
children with different types of psychiatric disorders.
The results provide useful information for clinicians as
well as policymakers.
Clinical and Policy Implications
Our findings indicate that patterns of service use are
influenced not only by sociodemographic factors but
also by types of disorders. Among children and adoles-
cents, depressive disorders are less likely to be identified
than disruptive disorders. Consequently, children with
depressive disorders are lesslikely to be referred to men-
tal health professionals. In future service planning, poli-
cymakers and clinicians need to find more effectiveways
to identify and appropriately refer depressed children.
The findings of this study indicate the important role of
school-based services in meeting children's needs for
mental health services.School-based servicesprovide an
efficient locus for the cost-effective delivery of mental
health services to children. Existing services should be
improved and new servicesdeveloped to meet children's
unmet needs. For example, there is a need for school-
based screening instruments to identify children's psy-
chiatric disorders at an early stage. Finally, parent's or
teacher's perceived need for child mental health services
plays a critical role in children's obtaining mental health
services. Further mental health education should be
offered to parents and teachers, which in turn will
improve early identification and treatment of children
with psychiatric disorders.

Commentary
JEFF Q. BOSTIC, M.D., EO.D.
Wu and colleagues (1999) illuminate the difficulty chil-
dren with depression too often experience in "getting
noticed," let alone in receiving treatment. Specifically,
this latest MECA report confirms the paucity of atten-
tion and services for children with depression when
compared with thosewith attention deficit, oppositional
defiant, or conduct disorders. Perhaps more troubling,
while juvenileswith depression recognized their need for
mental health services, their parents and teachers
frequently were unaware of the child's depression.
Disruptive disorders, by definition, impact the livesof
others, who often react by demanding intervention.
Fortunately, for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
particularly, we can respond with effective treatments
that benefit the child as well as parents and teachers.
Historically, treatments of juvenile depression have been
less predictable, rapid, or efficacious. Parents, teachers,
and even child and adolescent psychiatrists may be less
aggressive or able to identify something, such as depres-

sion, which usually distresses the individual afflicted more
than others in the environment. Given the powerful im-
pact of a depression on a juvenile, Wu and colleagues'
study reiterates the importance of detecting depression
even though it may not immediately distressothers.
Consistent with other epidemiological samples, girls
were almost twice as likely to be depressed as boys.
Sensitivity to adolescent girls' distress manifested in
depression or dysthymia continues to lag behind efforts
observed for boys manifesting behavioral problems dur-
ing this same age span. Similarly, ethnic differences were
described in this report, asdisruptivedisorderswere iden-
tified more often in African-Americans than in other eth-
nic groups. These discrepancies punctuate the need for
better identification and for equitable treatment of
diverse juvenileswith various psychiatric disorders.
Ultimately,Wu et al. suggest that expanding services
on-site at the school would be one appropriate strategy
for improving treatment of juvenile depression. As
schools absorb increasing responsibility for the care of
