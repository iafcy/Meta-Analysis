ABSTRACT
Objective: To describe the use of mental health and substance abuse services by children and adolescents as reported
from the four community sites included in the NIMH Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental
Disorders (MECA) Study. Method: As part of the MECA survey, questions were developed to identify children and
adolescents utilizing mental health and substance abuse services. Youths aged 9 through 17 years and a parent/
caretaker were interviewed. Because the investigators had concerns about the capacities of the younger children in
the study to describe their use of mental health services, more extensive questions were asked of parents than of
youths. Results: The procedures developed by the MECA project identified patterns of service use that varied in the
four communities surveyed. Agreement between reports of parents and youths regarding the use of mental health and
substance abuse services showed substantial inconsistencies, similar to reports of psychiatric disorders. At three of
the four sites, the majority of children meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder and scoring 60 or less on the Children's
Global Assessment Scale reported some mental health-related service in the previous year, although at two of the
sites fewer than 25% of these youths were seen in the mental health specialty sector. Conclusion: Community surveys
show great promise for monitoring the need for mental health and substance abuse services and for identifying patterns
of use. J. Am. Acad. Child Ado/esc. Psychiatry. 1996,35(7):889-897. Key Words: psychiatric disorders, child and

neighborhood environments that place them at high
risk for a psychiatric disorder (e.g., Richters and Marti-
nez, 1993). Recent studies have found high (e.g., Bird
et al., 1989; McGee et al., 1990; Offord et al., 1987;
Shafferet al., 1996; Whitaker et al., 1990) and possibly
increasing (Achenbach and Howell, 1993; Ryan et al.,
1992) rates of psychiatric disorders in children and
adolescents. We know little, however, about the use
of mental health services by children and adolescents
with psychiatric disorders or how recent changes in
the organization and financing of mental health services
have affected the availabiliry or accessibility of these
services.

Objectives of the Present Study
In recent years, much effort has been devoted to
improving procedures for detecting and classifyingpsy-
chiatric disorders in community samples of children
and adolescents (e.g., Costello et aI., 1993; Lahey er aI.,
1996; Shaffer et aI., 1996). In addition to increasing
our capacity to identify and monitor psychopathology,
the goal of the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH)-funded Methods for the Epidemiology of
Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA) Study
was to develop and test procedures for describing the
use of mental health services in different communities
and to determine whether the use of these serviceswas
related to the need for services (Lahey et al., 1996).
Even more than adults (Regier et aI., 1993), children
and adolescents receive mental health and substance
abuse servicesin a variety of settings and from numerous
professionals. If more effective systems of services are
to be developed, we need to know where children and
adolescents receive mental health services and whether
those in greatest need of these services are most likely
to receive treatment.
In describing the use of mental health and substance
abuse services in the four communities studied, we
first present the procedures developed by the MECA
project for the measurement ofservice-related variables.
We then describe the agreement between reports of
services made by parents and their children. Finally,
we describe patterns of service use at the four sites.
METHOD
Procedure
As described by Lahey et al. (1996). parents and youths aged
9 through 17 years were surveyed concerning demographic charac-
teristics of the child and his or her household, the existence of
psychiatric symptoms, level of functioning, and risk factors for
psychiatric disorders. Both youths and parents were asked to identify
the mental health and substance abuse services used by the youths
both in the previous year and ever in their lives. The parenr
interview obtained more detailed information than the youth
interview because the collaborators had concerns abour the ability
of youths to provide accurare reports concerning the details of
mental health-related service contacts.
ParentsReportsofServices. The services componenr of the inter-
view administered to parents obtained information about the
youths' contacts with health, school-based, social services,and other
service providers because of emotional or behavior problems or
because of drug or alcohol problems. In an interview that used
items modeled on the questions used in the National Comorbidity
Survey (Kessler et al. 1994), parenrs were provided a list of service
890
settings (hospital emergency room, drug or alcohol outpatient
clinic, psychiatric outpatient clinic, social service agency or depart-
ment, social program in jail or prison, drop-in center or program
for people with emotional or behavior problems or alcohol or drug
problems, mental health professional's private office, medical clinic,
health maintenance organization. or family clinic) and asked to
indicate whether the youth had ever been brought to any of these
settings becauseofan emotional, behavior. drug, or alcohol problem.
The parent also was provided with a list ofpotential serviceproviders
(pediatrician, general practitioner, family physician, psychiatrist,
psychologist, social worker, minister, rabbi, priest, other religious
leader, counselor, nurse, occupational therapist, another health
professional, spiritualist, herbalist, natural therapist, or faith healer)
and again asked to provide information about the youth's contacts
related to an emotional, behavior, drug, or alcohol problem.
For youths with any reported contact, information was collected
as to how old the youth was the first time a service was used, the
most recent use, whether insurance paid for any of the services,
and the frequency of contacts for nonschool services. Information
was collected about prescription medications used during the 12
months prior to the interview. For a child who had ever stayed
overnight in a hospital or other treatment program because of
emotional or behavior problems, or because of the use of alcohol
or drugs, information was collected about the type of treatment
facility, whether the treatment was for emotional or behavior
problems or drugs or alcohol, the number of admissions during
the previous year, and the number of nights spent in these facilities.
Parents were asked to report on whether the youth had received
extra help at school for emotional or behavior problems, alcohol
use problems, or drug use problems and on the nature of the
services received, the age of the youth when help was first received,
and whether help had been provided within the year prior to the
interview. The MECA project also obtained data, not discussed
in this report, on barriers to care and attitudes toward services.
In the analyses presented in this article, summaty measures were
created to identify the use of mental health and substance abuse
services in the year preceding the interview. Using the reports of
specificservicesand providers used by the youth, outpatient service
utilization was categorized into six types of services: (1) mental
health specialty sector including contacts with a psychiatrist, psy-
chologist, socialworker, or counselor in a private officeor psychiatric
outpatient facility, or unspecified location for each of these except
for the social worker; (2) medical services from a non psychiatrist
physician or a nurse; (3) school-based services; (4) clergy; (5) social
services; and (6) other or classification unknown, including services
provided by spiritualists. herbalists, natural therapists, or faith
healers. Inpatient and residential serviceswere categorized separately
and not discussed in this report, which focuses on outpatient or
community-based services.
Youtbs'<Reports ofServices. All youths were asked whether they
had ever received extra help in school for emotional or behavior
problems, alcohol use problems, or drug use problems; the nature
of the services received; their age when help was first received; and
whether help was provided within the year prior to the interview.
These questions about school-based serviceswere the same questions
asked of parents. Youths aged 12 and older also were asked whether
they had ever seen a professional outside of school for an emotional
or behavioral problem or for the use of drugs or alcohol. Youths
were not asked detailed questions about the type of professional
or site of service and youths aged 9 through 11 were not asked
about their contacts with professionals outside of school. Thus,
the youth data could not be categorized into the six types of

RESULTS
Because the primary goals of the MECA study were
methodological in nature, we begin with a comparison
of reports of service use by parents and youths. It is
important to point out that these data include visits
for mental health-related problems as defined by the
parent or youth. Detailed information about the treat-
ment provided during each contact is not available.
Parents and youths frequently differed in their re-
ports about the use of mental health services (Tables
1 and 2). Regarding school-based services, 14.2% of
the combined four-site sample were identified by parent
or youth as having had an in-school mental health or
substance abuse-related contact during the year prior
to the interview. Although agreement was greater than
chance, youths aged 9 through 12 years showed low
agreement with parents (K = .21), with youths aged
13 through 17 having a moderate level of agreement
(K = .45) and an overall youth-parent agreement of

Subjects
The sample has been described by Lahey et al. (1996); we will
provide only a summary.
Sites. Data were collectedfrom four geographic areas:(1) DeKalb,
Rockdale, and Henry Counties, Georgia; (2) three towns adjacent
to New Haven, Connecticut; (3) Westchester Counry, New York;
and (4) San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Populations. Children aged 9 through 17 years living in the
community were eligible for inclusion in the study. Almost all
adult respondents were mothers.
Samples. A random sample of community residenceswasselected
at each of the four sites. Data were collected on 1,285 child-adult
pairs, although three of the children studied provided limited data
because they had developmental delays.
Sample Demographics by Site. The demographic characteristics
of the sites were reported by Lahey et al. (1996). The sites did
not differ significantly in gender or age of the children studied,
but they did vary in other characteristics of the sample. The New
York sample had the greatest proportion of non-Hispanic whites,
the Georgia sample had the highest proportion of Mtican-Ameri-
cans, and the Puerto Rico sample had the highest proportion of
Hispanics. Sites also varied in terms of household income and
education of adult respondents, with the New York sample having
the highest incomes and the Puerto Rico sample the lowest.
Data Analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted with the Statistical Analysis
System (SAS Institute, 1989), using unweighted data.
services described in the previous section. For some analyses, a
variablewas created that combines reports from parents and youths.
Diagnosis and Functioning. Both parents and youths were inter-
viewedwith the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children
(DISC) Version 2.3, a highly structured diagnostic instrument
developed for use by lay interviewers (Shaffer et al., 1996). In this
study, we used a summary measure of psychiatric disorders that
included all children meeting criteria for any of the disorders
included in the DISC-2.3 with the exception of the screen for
psychosis and children who only met criteria for a diagnosis of
phobia. In determining the existence of a disorder, we used the
diagnostic algorithms that included data from both the parent and
child and that required reports of impairment based on questions
that were included in the DISC (Shaffer et al, 1996).
An important issue for clinicians and policy makers is whether
psychiatric services are being used by the youths most in need of
these services. Because the MECA researchers had only limited
experience with the impairment questions that are internal to the
DISC interview, we also present analyses that incorporated the
results of a more widely used measureof functioning, the Children's
Global AssessmentScale (CGAS) (Shafferet al., 1983). The CGAS
was completed by both the interviewer of the youth and the
interviewer of the parent, and it provided a summary of the worst
level of functioning of the youth during the 6 months prior to
the interview. In analysespresented, the CGAS score isdichtomized
into children scoring 61 and higher and those scoring 60 or less.
A score of 60 indicated that the youth had problems in some
situations that were noticeable to anyone, although the youth could
seem fine in other situations. Lowerscoresindicated more significant
impairment. Becausereports from both the parent and youth were
used in ascertaining the existence of a psychiatric disorder, the
lower of the parent and youth CGAS scores are used in the
analyses presented.

diagnostic criteria for at least one DISC diagnosis
were identified by both parent and youth as having a
psychiatric disorder, and only 23% of the youths aged
13 through 17 with one or more DISC disorders
were identified by both parent and youth as having a
psychiatric disorder. For children aged 9 through 12
who were using some school-based mental health ser-
vices, only 16% were identified by both parent and
youth. Of children aged 13 through 17 who had a
reported use of a school-based service, 33% were iden-
tified by both parent and youth, and of children aged
13 through 17 who reported using a non-school-based
service, 41% were identified by both parent and youth.
Little information is available from earlier studies
about whether or how use of mental health services
varies by community. Table 4 indicates that the four
sites included in the MECA project differed in the
reports of parents concerning the use of any mental
health or substance abuse services, and the specific
types of services used at each site, although the three
mainland sites produced similar reports of overall ser-
vice use. Those in New York were most likely to have
had some mental health-related services (18.1%), while
youths in Puerto Rico had the lowest report of service
use (7.4%). Sites differed significantly in use of mental
health specialistsand mental health contacts with gen-
eral medical providers. Youths at the Connecticut site
were three times as likely as those at the New York
site to have a mental health-related contact in the
general medical sector and 3.6 times as likely as youths
in Puerto Rico.
AsTable 4 indicates, school-based services and men-
tal health-related contacts with the clergy also showed

services was much greater than agreement concerning
use. For youths aged 9 through 12 years, when the
parent said no school-based services had been received,
92% of the youths agreed. However, when the parent
said school-based services had been received, only 30%
ofyouths agreed. For youths aged 13 through 17 years,
when the parent indicated that no school-based services
had been received,94% ofyouths agreed.When parents
said school-based services had been received, 56% of
youths agreed. When we examined agreement only for
youths meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder, we
found only a moderate level of agreement (x = .38),
with only 49% of the parent reports being confirmed
by youths.
Children aged 9 through 11 years were not asked
about mental health and substance abuse services pro-
vided outside of the school, so assessmentsof agreement
are limited to youths aged 12 through 17. As Table
2 shows, parents or youths identified 12.9% of the
youths aged 12 through 17 as having at least one
mental health-related servicecontact outside of school
during the year prior to the interview. The patterns
of agreement concerning use were similar to those
found for school-based services. For youths aged 9
through 12 years, when the parent said no nonschool
mental health services had been received, 96% of
the youths agreed. However, when the parent said
nonschool services had been received, only 31% of
youths agreed. For youths aged 13 through 17 years,
when the parent indicated that no nonschool services
had been received,98% ofyouths agreed.When parents
said nonschool services had been received, 46% of
youths agreed. When only youths meeting criteria for
a psychiatric disorder were included in the analyses,
agreement between parents and youths was .60 (ic)
compared with .29 (x) for youths not meeting criteria
for a psychiatric disorder.
The MECA project did not evaluate the test-retest
reliability of the questions related to service use, but
it was possible to examine agreement between parents
and youths concerning reports of psychiatric disorders.
As shown in Table 3, agreement between parents and
youths concerning the existenceof a psychiatricdisorder
was relativelylow (lC = .16), with the results not varying
much with the age of the child (ages 9 through 12
lC = .08 versus ages 13 through 17 lC = .23). Only
17% of the children aged 9 through 12 years meeting

significant site variations in the likelihood of use. At
all sites, mental health-related contacts were most
frequently provided in schools or by mental health
specialists. In three ofthe four communities, the excep-
tion being New Haven, mental health specialists were
more than twice as likely as nonpsychiatric physicians
to have had a mental health-related contact.
Although we did not ask younger children to differ-
entiate among providers of mental health services, it
is useful to examine the overall reports of mental
health-related contacts based on the combined reports
of the parents and youths. In Table 5, reports from
parents and youths are combined to provide an overall
estimate of the use of mental health services in the
four MECA communities. Patterns of service use are
very similar to those in Table 4, which are based
only on the reports of the parents. In addition to
investigating the overalluseofservices, Table 5 differen-
tiates between services provided in a school setting and
those outside ofschool, and services provided to youths
who met criteria for one of the psychiatric disorders
assessed by the DISC and those who did not.
As with the parent reports, we found significant
differences in the likelihood of service use in the four
MECA communities when we combined reports from
the parents and the youths, with the overall rates of
use being higher as a result of the inclusion of service
contacts reported by youths but not by parents. Overall
service use varies little in the three mainland sites,
from 22.8% in New York to 23.8% in Atlanta. When
we differentiated between the youths with a psychiatric
disorder as measured by the DISC (excluding the
psychosis screen and phobias) and those not meeting
criteria for a disorder, we found that serviceusediffersin
the four communities only for those with a psychiatric
disorder. At the three mainland sites, between 38.4%
and 43.5% of all the children meeting criteria for a
psychiatric disorder in the previous 6 months also had

some mental health-related contact in the year prior
to the interview.
An important question for clinicians, policy makers,
and advocates is whether children with more severe or
disabling psychiatric disorders are more likely than
other children to receive treatment. Combining the
data from the four MECA sites, Table 6 indicates that
youths with psychiatric disorders and poor function ing
as measured by the CGAS were 6.8 times more likely
to have seen a mental health specialistthari were youths
without a psychiatric disorder and with a higher level
of functioning. When we examined the combined
reports from parents at all four sites concerning contacts
with mental health specialists, we found that having
a psychiatric disorder (X2 = 10.48, df= 1, P < .001)
and having significant impairment in functioning, mea-
sured by a CGAS score of 60 or less (X2 = 17.80, df=
1, P < .001), each had a significant effect on reported
use of mental health specialists.
As Table 6 indicates, when we categorized children
by diagnostic status and level of functioning, we found
significant differences in the rates of service use only
for the children with a DISC diagnosis and a higher
level of functioning (CGAS = 61 or more). The use
of mental health specialists by youths with psychiatric
disorders and significant dysfunction were similar in
the four communities studied, although the four com-
munities differed in the percentage of children with a
diagnosis who received mental health services and the
percentage of children with a diagnosis and a CGAS
score of 61 or greater.
DISCUSSION
States and local communities are restructuring their
systems for delivering services to children and adoles-
cents without the benefit of data concerning the preva-
lence of specific psychiatric disorders, the level of
dysfunction accompanying these disorders, or knowl-
edge ofthe use of existing services. Many of the changes
in the organization and financing of mental health
services are being driven by concerns with the overall
cost of health care. These broad efforts to reduce the
cost of Medicaid programs or the cost to corporations
of health benefits pay only limited attention to issues
related to the provision of services to youths with
serious emotional or behavioral problems. To ensure
that the needs of children with serious emotional
disturbances are met, it will be important to monitor
the changes in health care policy and the changes in
the patterns and outcomes of mental health services
that accompany these changes in policy.
The MECA study demonstrates the feasibility of
conducting community-based research to examine the
use of services by youths meeting criteria for one
or more psychiatric disorders and the potential for
generating data that can be used for structuring and
monitoring systems of mental health services for chil-
dren. Even with the relatively small samples obtained
at each MECA site, we have been able to detect
differences in patterns of service use, with important
implications for understanding the detection and treat-
ment of mental disorders. Important findings of this

study included the importance of schools in the provi-
sion of mental health services and the finding that
symptomatology and dysfunction have independent
effects on the use of mental health services.
We had expected to find that reports of mental
health serviceswere related to the existence ofa mental
disorder. The finding that impairment also had an
independent effect on use of mental health services
warrants further investigation. It may be that dysfunc-
tion in children and adolescents precipitates the seeking
of help regardless of the perceived cause of these
problems, and some of this help-seeking is related to
emotional distress not related to one of the psychiatric
disorders assessed by the DISC. Future studies will
need to investigatewhether only certain types ofimpair-
ment are related to use of mental health services and
the extent to which the failure to provide mental
health servicesto certain youths, e.g., older youths with
conduct disorders, could be influencing these findings.
The MECA project constitutes an important attempt
to link assessments of psychopathology with reports
ofservice use. Although the lack of agreement between
reports of parents and yourhs concerning the use of
mental health services is similar to that found with
reports of psychiatric disorders, this is an area of
investigation where additional methodological work is
required. In this study, we did not ask younger children
the same questions about the use of mental health
services as we asked older children. This means that
we did not receive reports of service use from these
children, although we did receive reports of symptoms
from them. Additional research and deliberation will
be required to determine the best way to obtain infor-
mation concerning psychopathology in younger chil-
dren and their use of mental health services.
For the purposes of this study, service use was
defined as a contact with a mental health professional
or other service provider related to a mental health or
behavioral problem or a problem with alcohol or drugs.
Some of these contacts might not have involved treat-
ment or mental health services. Many of the providers
and service settings included in the list of potential
service sites perform activities in addition to the treat-
ment of mental disorders. For example, pediatricians
might refer children rather than provide treatment,
and many school-based contacts might reflect testing
rather than treatment, or even punishment for "bad"
behaviors. In developing estimates of met and unmet

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE USE
needs, future research should examine the reasons for
specific contacts and monitor in greater detail the
activities that take place during the "service contact."
This study found that one quarter of the youths
had some reported mental health service contact, with
36.5% of those meeting criteria for a psychiatric disor-
der having a report of a mental health service. In no
community did as many as a third of the youths
with a psychiatric disorder and significant impairment
receive services from a mental health specialist. Future
researchwill need to pay greater attention to monitoring
the standards ofcare provided in different communities
and determining whether some patterns of practice are
more highly related to positive outcomes for youths
than others. Many of the youths with a psychiatric
disorder who did not receive services experienced less
impairment and/or may have recovered without the
use of formal services. Additional attention must be
paid to developing an overall estimate of the number
of children who are in need of treatment during any
specified period of time. At a minimum, it will be
important to take severity into account when trying
to determine the extent to which there is a need for
specific types of mental health service and the overall
magnitude of the problem for different communities.
These data also suggest that greater attention needs
to be paid to the many professionals, especially social
workers, psychologists, and teachers, who play critical
roles in the identification and treatment of children
with serious emotional disturbances. Schools present
an important opportunity for the early detection of
psychiatric disorders and the mobilization of resources
for the support of youths with serious emotional and
behavioral problems. The frequency with which mental
health-related contacts are reported in schools suggests
that psychiatrists and mental health professionals need
to pay greater attention to collaborations with school-
based professionals, the training needs of these staff,
and the supervision of mental health services provided
within schools. Are children reported as having mental
health-related contacts actually receiving mental health
services or are they simply receiving information about
potential referrals? We need to examine the roles played
by educational, social service, and juvenile justice agen-
cies in the detection and treatment of youths with
serious emotional disturbances and the extent to which
the policies and programs in these agencies facilitate

the identification and treatment of children with psy-
chiatric disorders.
A limitation of the MECA study was the differences
in time frames used to assess symptoms and service
use. Information about psychopathology focused on
the 6 months prior to the interview. Seasonalvariations
related to school assessments necessitated a different
time frame, a l-year interval, for reports of service use.
This inconsistency in time frames in the current study
may have resulted in some youths being classified as
using services while not meeting diagnostic criteria,
when both the disorder and service use could have co-
occurred during the period 7 to 12 months prior to
the interview. Future research needs to pay greater
attention to more closely relating the assessments of
psychopathology and dysfunction with reports of ser-
VIce use.
The procedures developed for the MECA surveys
constitute an important strategy for collecting the type
of data that will be necessary if future health and
mental health care systems are going to meet the
diverse needs of children and adolescents with serious
emotional disturbances. Projects such as the MECA
project and the ongoing NIMH cooperative agreement
studying the use, need, outcomes, and cost of mental
health services in child and adolescent populations
(UNOCCAP) will be very important as mental health
professionals, policy makers, and consumers attempt
to monitor changes in the servicesprovided to children
that would accompany the health care reform plans
currently under consideration. The identification of a
large number of children whose mental health contacts
occur in schools, social service agencies, and juvenile
justice agenciessuggeststhat many of the costs incurred
in the provision of mental health services are not
included in data obtained only from the formal mental
health service system. Efforts monitoring the effects of
future health care reforms also will need to monitor
potential shifts in the settings where children with
serious emotional problems are served to ensure that
these children have access to appropriate services.
