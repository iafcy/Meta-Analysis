Service Use by At-Risk Youth after School-Based Suicide
Screening
Abstract
Objective—We sought to examine follow-up service use by students identified at risk for
suicidal behavior in a school-based screening program, and assess barriers to seeking services as
perceived by youth and parents.
Method—We conducted a longitudinal study of 317 at-risk youth identified by a school-based
suicide screening in six high schools in New York State. The at-risk teenagers and their parents
were interviewed approximately two years after the initial screen to assess service use during the
intervening period and identify barriers that may have interfered with seeking treatment.
Results—At the time of the screen, 72% of the at-risk students were not receiving any type of
mental health service. Of these students, 51% were deemed in need of services and subsequently
referred by us to a mental health professional. Nearly 70% followed through with the screening’s
referral recommendations. Youth and their parents reported perceptions about mental health
problems, specifically relating to the need for treatment, as the primary reasons for not seeking
service.
Conclusions—Screening appears to be effective in enhancing the likelihood that students at risk
for suicidal behavior will get into treatment. Well developed and systematic planning is needed to
ensure that screening and referral services are coordinated so as to facilitate access for youth into
timely treatment.

Screening is a prominent component of youth suicide prevention activities, recommended by
the U.S. Surgeon General,1 the Institute of Medicine,2 and the President’s New Freedom
Commission 3 as a means to combat the third leading cause of death in youths aged 10 to 19
years old.4 Schools have been specifically targeted for screening programs, as well as other
promising suicide prevention program models, such as gatekeeper training programs,5, 6
because of the convenience by which children and adolescents can be reached,7 and
schools’ inherent ties to a student’s family and community.8 Both screening and gatekeeper
training programs seek to identify students at risk for suicide and enhance their referral to
appropriate services, but the means to identify the students differ. Screening incorporates
direct inquiry of the students via self-report assessments9; whereas, gatekeeper training
programs aim to increase case-finding by improving school staff’s knowledge and skills in
intervening with suicidal students.10 School-based gatekeeper training programs may be
limited in their scope of detecting youth at risk for suicide,11 while screening programs are
particularly sensitive in their ability to identify at-risk children, not otherwise identified by
school personnel.12 A study of 1729 students from seven high schools who completed the
Columbia Suicide Screen demonstrated that the majority of students who screened at risk
were not identified by school professionals. Furthermore, screening yielded a lower false

positive rate and higher positive predictive value when identifying significant mental health
problems compared to school professionals’ identifications.12 Several other studies have
examined the clinical validity and reliability of school-based screening procedures, yielding
encouraging results.9, 13–16 Additionally, concerns surrounding the possible iatrogenic
effects of screening programs have proved unsubstantiated, with research finding no
evidence that asking youth about suicide increases distress or suicidality.17
While research has supported suicide screening programs’ ability to identify at-risk youths,
what is lacking is a systematic assessment of whether at-risk youth have actually accessed
services after their identification by the screen.18 A recent study of a school-based
gatekeeper training suicide prevention program found that more than two thirds of at-risk
students accessed mental health services following the program.6 No comparable study
examining service use follow-through by students identified as at-risk in a screening
program has yet been reported. A suicide screening procedure is only as effective as its
ability to get at-risk students the care that they need, therefore this study sought to examine
service use follow-through by students who screened as at-risk for suicidal behavior and to
identify barriers that youth and parents perceived as preventing them from following up on
referrals.
METHOD
Participants
At-risk students (n=317) were identified during a two-stage screening program conducted
from fall of 2002 through spring of 2004 involving 2,342 adolescents aged 13 through 19
years enrolled in ninth through twelfth grade in six high schools in Nassau, Suffolk, and
Westchester counties in New York State. Five schools were public coeducational schools
and one school was an all-boys parochial school. These schools were part of a study
examining whether asking about suicide creates increased distress or suicidal ideation.17
The project employed a group-randomized design in which classes within each school were
randomized to either an experimental group, which received a 1st screening survey with a set
of questions assessing suicidal ideation and behavior, or a control group, which received the
same 1st survey but without suicide questions. Both groups received the same 2nd survey
with suicide questions on a subsequent day. Of the 317 at-risk students, 179 and 139 were
identified from the experimental and control groups, respectively.
The at-risk students were followed approximately two years after the initial screen (over
92% in 2005 and the remainder in 2006). The mean number of days between the initial
survey and follow-up assessment was 750 for the youth (ranging from 519 days to 1,207),
and 751 days for the parents (ranging from 522 to 1,200 days). Approximately 70% (n=223)
of the at-risk students and/or their parents participated in the follow up. Nearly 75% (n=167)
had both informant reports, 13.5% had only youth reports, and 11.7% had only parents
reports at follow up. There were no significant differences between follow-up participants
(having either a youth or parent interview) and non-participants in terms of ethnicity,
original risk status, and functional impairment (Table 1), but follow-up participants were
older (t-test = 2.35, p<.05) than non-participants and more likely to be female (χ2 = 6.68, <.
05).
Measures
The same measures were used in screening and follow-up assessments, unless otherwise
noted. Self-completion screening questionnaires were completed by the students over two
class periods, on separate days (described in detail elsewhere).17 The follow-up measures
were administered in an interview format via telephone separately to youths and their

parents. The content of the parent and youth interviews was similar, with the exception of
the exclusion of the parent’s assessment of the youth’s mental health status. While parents
are essential for an accurate assessment of service use,19–21 adolescents provide the most
clinically relevant assessment of their psychological distress.22
Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ-JR)—The 15-item SIQ-JR23 uses a 7-point
Likert-type scale, ranging from 0 (“I never had this thought”) to 6 (“This thought was in my
mind almost every day”), assessing the frequency of specific suicidal thoughts during the
past month. It assesses a wide range of thoughts related to death and dying, passive and
active suicidal ideation, and suicidal intent. Reliability of the SIQ-JR is high, ranging from .
91 to .9623–25 for internal consistency and from .87 to .93 for test-retest reliability (.89
overall; .87 for females and .93 for males).25 The SIQ-JR has demonstrated criterion
validity, 23, 25, 26 construct validity in community24, 25, 27 and clinical samples 26 and
predictive validity.24
Suicide Attempt History—Seven questions asking about lifetime and recent suicide
attempts were derived from the depression module of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for
Children (DISC-IV)28 and an earlier suicide screen.29 These items have demonstrated good
construct validity.29, 30 The assessment of an attempt included questions about
occurrences, injuries sustained, medical care sought and hospitalization.31
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-IA)—The BDI-IA32 contains 21 items that assess
cognitive, behavioral, affective, and somatic components of depression.. The responses for
each question range from 0 (the depressive symptom is not present) to 3 (the symptom is
severe). The BDI has demonstrated excellent internal consistency (0.8 to 0.9) and good test-
retest reliability (0.7) in research in adolescents33, 34 and excellent sensitivity (83.3) and
specificity (81.3) in identifying major depression in adolescents35 The BDI has been used in
over 200 studies, many of which included adolescents. 33–35
Drug Use Screening Inventory (DUSI)—The DUSI36, 37 is designed to screen for
alcohol or drug use and problems among teenagers, and has demonstrated good reliability,
discriminant validity and sensitivity and has published normative cutoff scores.e.g. 36–39 A
total score combines all 15 items from the substance use scale (assessing the degree of
involvement and severity of consequences from alcohol and drug use), 3 alcohol or drug
items on the school performance adjustment scale, and 1 additional aggression item
assessing the clinically predictive problem of breaking things or getting into fights while
under the influence of alcohol or drugs.40
Columbia Impairment Scale (CIS)—The CIS provides a measure of overall severity of
functional impairment.41 It is a 13 item scale taps four major areas of functioning:
interpersonal relationships, school/work, certain broad areas of psychopathology (general
behavior or mood), and use of leisure time. The CIS has demonstrated good internal
consistency (0.7 – 0.9 ), test-retest reliability (0.6 – 0.9) and discriminant validity.41 The
CIS also shows moderate to high correlations with other specific indications of
psychological dysfunction, such as referral for mental health interventions.42 The CIS was
administered to both adolescents and their parents at the follow up.
The Services Assessment for Children and Adolescents (SACA)—The SACA43,
44 is designed to collect service use information from parents and children who are at least
11 years of age. The SACA includes a structured format, and covers multiple time frames,
multiple service settings, and both barrier and benefit questions. The SACA queries
participants about lifetime and one-year service use histories regarding various inpatient,
et al.

outpatient, and school settings and individual modules with detailed questions about
location, content and amount of care. We modified the SACA to include separate time
frames reflecting service use prior to, concurrent with, and following the screen. The SACA
was administered only at follow up.
Help-seeking Utilization Questionnaire—The HUQ45 is a modification of Offer’s
Mental Health Utilization Questionnaire46 and at baseline provided information on the
extent to which students received help for an emotional problem in the month prior to the
survey. Current treatment (at time of survey) with a psychiatrist, psychologist or social
worker was also assessed. At follow up, the HUQ was incorporated into the SACA,
assessing the frequency of utilization of informal sources of help (i.e., parents, friends,
siblings, teachers, coaches), and 18 reasons for non-use of each type of service. A factor
analysis of the reasons for non-use has yielded three interpretable dimensions of related
characteristics corresponding to specific reasons for nonuse of helping sources: “shame,”
“self-efficacy,” or “structure”.47
Definition of At-Risk Status
A youth was determined to be “at-risk” from the baseline screen if he/she (1) reported
serious suicidal ideation as operationalized by a score greater than or equal to 31 on the SIQ-
JR; or an endorsement of any of 6 SIQ-JR “critical items” at the clinically significant levels
of “a couple of times a week” or “almost every day” (“I thought about killing myself”; “I
thought about how I would kill myself”; “I thought about when I would kill myself”; “I
thought about what to write in a suicide note”; “I thought about writing a will”; “I thought
about telling people I had a plan to kill myself”); or an endorsement of BDI item statements
“I would like to kill myself ” or “I would kill myself if I had a chance”; (2) endorsed a past
suicide attempt (regardless of timing, injury or medical attention); (3) exhibited depression
as defined by a BDI score greater than or equal to 16; or (4) reported a substance problem,
as manifested by an endorsement of 4 out of 8 clinically significant impairment items on the
DUSI.17 These risk criteria were based on those identified in psychological autopsy studies
of youth suicide.5
Clinical and Case-Management Procedures
One of two procedures followed the screen depending on its results. For adolescents
reporting serious suicidal ideation, any past suicide attempt, depression with any level of
suicidal ideation, or a request to talk to a clinician, a “Safety Review” interview was
conducted by a project child psychiatrist, psychologist or social worker. Members of the
project’s clinical team interviewed these adolescents to assess imminent suicide risk and the
need for further evaluation and possible treatment. If survey responses were substantiated
during the interview, a project social worker contacted the parents by telephone to provide a
summary of the screening results, verify a student’s report of current treatment, and discuss
recommendations for further evaluation and treatment with a local mental health provider.
Adolescents who scored above the cutoff on the BDI or DUSI, without reporting current
suicidal ideation or history of attempts, were not interviewed by our project’s clinical team;
however their parents were notified of their survey findings by project social workers. Based
on students’ level of functional impairment and seriousness of suicidal ideation and
symptomatology, our project social workers recommended either a specific referral,
provided lists of mental health resources in the area, or merely discussed the screening
findings with the parents. During the telephone interaction between the project social worker
and the parents, parents were always offered help with specific referrals if they wanted our
assistance. Provider lists were offered to all parents of students deemed in need of treatment,
based on the clinical interview, but parents did not always want these lists because they
either had other sources of treatment or did not feel treatment was necessary. All families

were given contact information for the project social worker in case they wanted future
assistance. On occasion, school guidance personnel took over the case-management
responsibilities if parents preferred their assistance. Project social workers facilitated
referrals by providing several names of local mental health facilities or practitioners from a
referral list that we developed for each community. The parent’s insurance status and
managed care plan was taken into consideration. Uninsured families were referred to mental
health resources in the community that accommodated their financial limitations. A specific
referral was developed in collaboration with the parents, and they were advised to contact
providers directly to schedule appointments. We offered to discuss our findings with the
therapists after the appointments were made, with the parents’ permission. Unless parents
refused the social workers’ recommendations, parents’ follow through was tracked until an
appointment had been attended or it became clear that follow through was not likely to
happen in a reasonable amount of time.
The study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the NYS
Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University Department of Psychiatry.
Data Analysis
A series of univariate logistic regression and chi-square analyses were conducted to examine
the relationships between service use follow-through and demographic and baseline clinical
characteristics. This analytic strategy was also used to determine whether demographic and
baseline clinical factors were related to treatment status at the time of the screen. Treatment
status at the time of the screen was examined within the total baseline sample of at-risk
youth; whereas service follow-through was examined within a subset who participated in the
follow up.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the distribution of screening risk criteria for the 317 at-risk youth, of whom
half (n=159) met more than one of the criteria. Serious suicidal ideation and/or a past suicide
attempt were endorsed by 138 students (43.5%).
Treatment Status at the Time of the Screen
At the time of the screen, 71.6% (n=227) of at-risk students were not receiving any type of
mental health services (Table 2). Students in treatment were more likely to have endorsed
having made a past suicide attempt and were more likely to report functional impairment
than those not in treatment. No significant differences in suicidal ideation, depression, or
substance problems emerged between those students who were in treatment and those who
were not in treatment at the time of the screen. Of the 92 students who reported a past
suicide attempt, 42.4% were in treatment at the time of the screen. The rates of treatment
among youth reporting current serious suicidal ideation, depression, a substance problem, or
functional impairment was 29.3%, 29.1%, 31.6%, 36.6%, respectively.
Of the 90 students in some form of mental health treatment, 55.6% were receiving
psychotherapy, 12.2% were receiving medication only, and 28.9% were receiving a
combination of psychotherapy and medication. Further, 21.1% were receiving services from
an in-school provider only, 61.1% were receiving services from an out-patient provider only,
and 16.7% were receiving services both in and out of school.
Screening Referral Recommendations
Of those 227 students who were not receiving any mental health services at the time of the
screen, we made a referral for 118 students, gave a list of local providers without a specific

referral to 35 students, and gave no specific referral or provider list to 74 students. Of this
latter group, we either deemed no treatment or further evaluation was needed (n=58) or the
parent did not need or want our assistance (n=16). Students who received a referral were
significantly more likely to have expressed current serious suicidal ideation (35.9%) on the
screen than those who received a provider list (14.7%) or were not given a referral (15.1%;
χ2 = 12.8 p< 01). Furthermore, those who received a referral or were given a provider list
both reported more functional impairment (51.3%, 45.2% respectively) than those given no
referral (28.6%; χ2 = 9.2 p<.05). These differences reflect the criteria that we used for
deciding what kind of referral to make. There were no significant differences in age, gender,
ethnicity, depression, substance abuse and/or drug impairment, or past attempt history
between those students who received a referral and those who did not. We also made a
referral to 29 of the 90 students who were already in some form of concurrent treatment at
the time of the screening. This decision was based on the belief that either more extensive,
or a different type of, treatment would be of benefit.
Service Use Follow-through
The follow-up participation rate (70.3%; n=223) did not differ significantly by our
screening’s referral recommendation (68.0% (100/147), 75.7% (28/37) and 71.4% (95/133)
for those who received a referral, provider list, or no referral information, respectively; χ2 =
0.96. p>.05), but did differ significantly by the student’s treatment status at the time of the
screen (66.5% (151/227) and 80% (72/90) for those who had not previously been in
treatment and those who had been in treatment, respectively (χ2 = 12.06 p<.001). However,
there were no significant demographic or clinical differences between those followed and
those not followed among the group not in treatment at the time of the screen, with the
exception that the participants were more likely to be female (χ2 = 7.1 p<.01).
Among the 151 students in the follow-up sample who were not receiving any mental service
at the time of the screen, the proportion of students who sought a new mental health service
following the screen differed significantly by our screening’s referral recommendation
(69.2% (54/78), 42.3% (11/26) and 31.9% (15/47) for those who received a referral,
provider list, or no referral information, respectively; χ2 = 17.8. p<.001). Approximately
three-quarters (76.9%) of those who followed through with our referral recommendation
reported that their decision to seek services had been influenced by the screening. A lower
percentage of those given a provider list (50%) or no referral information (53.3%) reported
such influence (χ2 = 4.9 p<.10).
Table 3 presents the demographic and baseline clinical characteristics of the 78 students who
were not in treatment at the time of the screen and who received a new referral,
differentiating the 54 students who followed through with the referral and the 24 students
who did not seek any form of treatment. New service users were significantly more likely to
have been depressed (p<.05) at the initial screen; no other significant differences existed.
Of the 54 new service users, 7 students received services from an in-school provider only,
25 received services from an outpatient provider only, and the remaining 22 students sought
multiple services (including five students who utilized an inpatient service at some point
between the screening and follow up). Moreover, 44 students had received psychotherapy
alone, 6 students received psychotherapy and medication, 3 received some other type of
treatment (e.g. acupuncture, “Christian counseling”), and one participant’s type of treatment
was unknown to us. No participants went on to only receive medication without the
provision of psychotherapy. Overall, 24% of the new service users had their first
appointment within a month following the screen. Within six months, 52% had kept their
first appointment, and within a year 70% had successfully reached a mental health provider.
et al.

The number of treatment sessions ranged from 1 to 104, with a median of 10 visits. Only 2%
of the new service users had only one treatment visit.
Barriers to Service
Table 4 presents the parent- and youth-perceived barriers to seeking or receiving services
among the subsample that received a referral but did not pursue services after the screen.
Both youth and their parents reported perceptions about mental health problems, specifically
relating to the need for treatment, as the primary reasons for not seeking service. Structural
barriers and perceptions about the helpfulness of mental health services did not appear to
play a central role in a lack of follow-up service use.
DISCUSSION
The vast majority of youth identified by the school-based screening program to be at risk for
suicidal behavior were not in treatment at the time of the screen. Over half of the youth who
had attempted suicide in the past were not receiving services. Approximately two thirds of
students reporting current serious suicide ideation, depression, substance use problems, or
impaired functioning were not receiving any services. These findings underscore the
persistently high levels of unmet service needs among youth at risk for suicidal behavior.
The findings are consistent with the New Freedom Commission’s recommendations to
expand the role of school mental health services in transforming mental health care for
youth.8 Specifically, school-based screening programs can be effective in identifying at risk
youth who are not receiving service and provide opportunities for referral.
Approximately, two thirds of those who we referred to treatment had used a new service by
the follow-up approximately 2 years later. This rate of service use follow-through is similar
to that reported after a gatekeeper training program.6 Thus, both screening and gatekeeper
training appear to facilitate youth’s accessing mental health services. The services accessed
after the screen were mainly outpatient services incorporating some form of psychotherapy
rather than pharmacotherapy.
Access to mental health services by youth depends upon the recognition and actions of key
adults,19, 20 as well as on their own perception of a problem. This is consistent with our
finding that the most prevalent barriers to service use were primarily related to parents’ and
youth’s perceptions about mental health problems, specifically thinking that the problem
wasn’t serious enough to warrant services; thinking that the problem would get better on its
own; wanting to solve the problem by oneself (or within the family); not believing that any
real problem existed. Educating parents as well as youth about the seriousness of risk
behaviors needs to be enhanced, suggesting that screening programs may need to be
augmented to include educational efforts targeting parents. It is important to note that recent
efforts by national family support organizations, such as the National Alliance for Mental
Illness (NAMI) and Children and Adults with ADD (CHADD) have developed and are
making available free of charge in many communities across the country educational
programs targeted at parents of children with mental health issues. Encouragement of
parents whose teen-agers screen positive to participate in these kinds of programs could be
an important adjunct to school-based screening programs.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report service use follow-through after a suicide
screening program. The inclusion of both youths and parents in the follow up and a
comprehensive assessment of service use enhanced our understanding of the rates of service
use, types of services used and perceived barriers among parents and youth. However, the
study has several limitations that may have contributed to an overestimate of follow up
service use. First, we employed suburban schools with predominantly white populations of
et al.

limited socioeconomic diversity because the sampling frame was dictated by design
considerations of our earlier study.17 As such, the results cannot be generalized to urban,
more ethnically or socioeconomically diverse settings, which include minority youths who
are less likely to receive needed mental health services, especially in their communities
outside of school.48 Second, not all of our families had health insurance, but we did not
routinely record this information, so we cannot provide the rate of uninsured families in our
sample. Third, girls were more likely to participate in the follow up, notably among those
who had not received mental health services at the time of the screen, and tended to follow-
through more with referrals than boys. This may have yielded an overestimation of the
overall rate of help-seeking following the screen. Fourth, the screening program utilized
project mental health clinicians who interviewed adolescents reporting serious distress,
serious suicidal ideation or any past suicide attempt to assess imminent suicide risk and the
need for further evaluation and possible treatment. Parents were also informed about any
other of the risk criteria (i.e., depression and significant substance problems) exhibited by
their children and referrals were arranged with parents by project social workers. It is highly
unlikely that any school would have such a wealth of specialized mental health personnel,
particularly in the current environment of severe state and local budget deficits and
corresponding funding cutbacks to schools; thus, schools undertaking screening programs
may face challenges in implementing these critical case management activities.49
In summary, screening appears to be effective in enhancing the likelihood that students at
risk for suicidal behavior will get into treatment. It should be considered a critical
component of school-based suicide prevention programs. However, nearly one third of at
risk students still do not get into treatment and only a quarter of students who sought
treatment did so within a month of the screen, so that the timeliness of treatment is also a
concern. Thus, while school-based screening and referral programs can improve
identification of at risk youth they do not guarantee that identified youth will gain access to
treatment. This is why well developed and systematic planning is needed to ensure that
screening and referral services are coordinated so as to facilitate access for youth into timely
treatment. Because schools often operate independently from mental health treatment
providers, one cannot assume that this coordination will occur without careful facilitation of
it. Furthermore, to maximize a screening program’s impact, future efforts will be needed to
enhance the engagement of parents and youth and address their perceptions about mental
health problems.
