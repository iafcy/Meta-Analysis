# Mental Disorders and Service Utilization Among Youths From Homeless and Low-Income Housed Families

JOHN C. BUCKNER, PH.D., AND ELLEN L. BASSUK, M.D.

**ABSTRACT**

**ObJective: To assess the mental health of homeless and poor housed youths, using the National Institute of Mental**

Health (NIMH) Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) Version 2.3, and to examine mental health service use.

**Method: As part of a comprehensive study of homeless and housed families in Worcester, MA, data were collected on**

41 homeless and 53 poor housed (never homeless) youths aged 9 to 17 using both the parent and youth versions of the

DISC. Results: On the basis of the parent version of the DISC, current (6-month) prevalence rates of DSM-III-R disrup-

tive behavior, affective, and anxiety disorders were comparable in homeless and housed youths but higher than rates

found among youths in the NIMH-sponsored Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders

(MECA) Study. which used the same diagnostic measure. Approximately 32% of the combined sample of homeless and

housed youths had a current mental disorder accompanied by impairment in functioning. Mental health service use in the

preceding 6 months among youths who had one or more current disorders and associated impairment ranged from 20%

to 35%. A subgroup of youths with one or more current disorders and poor global functioning had never received treat-

ment. Conclusions: This sample of homeless and housed youths was found to have high rates of current mental dis-

orders. Use of mental health services by children with mental health needs was low, particularly for youths with poor

overall functioning. J. Am. Acad. Child Ado/esc. Psychiatry, 1997,36(7):890-900. Key Words: homelessness. poverty,
