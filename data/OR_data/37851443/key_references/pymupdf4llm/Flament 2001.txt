**ABSTRACT**

**Objective: To compare phenomenology, psychosocial correlates, and treatment seeking in DSM-III-R major depression**

and dysthymia among adolescents diagnosed as cases in a community-based study. Method: A self-report questionnaire,

including psychosocial data, life events, eating behaviors, depressive symptoms, substance use, pathological behaviors,

and family and school functioning was administered to a nonselected sample (N = 3,287, 93.2% of targeted population) of

adolescents aged 11 to 20 years from several Haute-Marne communities in France in 1988–1989. Subgroups of subjects

(n = 205, 84.7% of eligible subjects) were interviewed with a structured diagnostic schedule, and adolescents with major

depression (n = 49), dysthymia (n = 21) and controls (n = 135) were compared. Results: Nearly 30% of controls had at

least one current symptom of depression. Patterns of affective symptoms were similar in major depression and dysthymia,

but significant differences emerged in comorbid conditions (more anxiety disorders, suicidal behaviors, and alcohol intoxi
cations associated with major depression) and stressor at onset (more severe in major depression). Experiences of loss

during the prior 12 months were associated with both forms of affective disorder, while poor family relationships were spe
cific correlates of dysthymia. In contrast, peer relationships and pathological behaviors did not differ between depressed

subjects and controls. Although psychosocial functioning was significantly impaired in both groups of depressed adoles
cents, treatment seeking was limited to 34.7% for major depressive subjects and 23.8% for dysthymic subjects.

**Conclusion: The results provide evidence that major depression and dysthymia in adolescence are equally severe but may**

have distinct patterns in associated factors. Despite free access to health care, the rate of treatment seeking for mood dis
orders in France is similar to that reported in U.S. studies. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2001, 40(9):1070–1078.

**Key Words: major depression, dysthymic disorder, adolescence, phenomenology, treatment seeking.**


The study of affective disorders in adolescence is of critical psychiatric importance. In adolescents, major depression and dysthymic disorder are frequent, recurrent, and
often familial disorders that tend to continue into adulthood. They are frequently associated with other psychiat

ric conditions, poor psychosocial and academic outcome,
and increased risk of substance abuse, bipolar disorder,
and suicide (for review, see Birmaher et al., 1996).
Population studies of adolescents have reported lifetime
prevalence of major depression ranging from 0.4% to
8.3% (Birmaher et al., 1996; Garrison et al., 1997) and
point prevalence of dysthymic disorder from 1.6% to 8%
(Garrison et al., 1997; Kashani et al., 1987; Lewinsohn
et al., 1994). In adolescents, the female-male ratio for
affective disorders is approximately 2:1, paralleling the
ratio reported in adults (Fleming and Offord, 1990;
Lewinsohn et al., 1994). The majority of youths with
clinical depression are not seen by health professionals
(Burns, 1991; Costello et al., 1993). Research suggests
that prevention of adolescent affective disorders is possible when populations at elevated risk are targeted for
psychosocial interventions: promising results have been
obtained in programs developed for children of depressed

parents (Beardslee et al., 1992) and for adolescents with
subclinical depressive symptomatology (Clarke et al.,
1995). Numerous factors are associated with the onset,
duration, and recurrence of juvenile depression, including demographic factors, phenomenology of symptoms,
comorbid conditions, family factors, psychosocial factors,
and stressful life events (for review, see Birmaher et al.,
1996; Hoberman et al., 1996; Moreau, 1996). The links
between adolescent depression and substance use have
been emphasized by several authors (Desimone et al., 1994;
Rao et al., 2000; Whitmore et al., 1997). Most of these
findings are from studies conducted in U.S. sites and in
populations under treatment for major depression (Roberts
et al., 1995). It is therefore important to examine the
phenomenology and psychosocial correlates of major
depression and dysthymia in adolescents from the community in non-U.S. sites. In particular, it is worth exploring
the crucial question as to whether the rate of identification and treatment of affective disorders in adolescents is
higher in European countries that have free access to psychiatric care. We describe results from an epidemiological
study conducted in secondary schools of a geographical district in France. The aims of the study were to compare the
phenomenology and psychosocial correlates of DSM_III-R major depression and dysthymia among adolescents_
diagnosed as cases in a community-based study. We focused
particularly on associated diagnostic and behavioral features, environmental factors, psychosocial impairment,
and treatment seeking, according to diagnostic subgroups.

**METHOD**

The study followed a two-stage design: a self-report questionnaire was
first administered to a large, unselected school population; then, after
subjects were designated into subgroups (based on responses to the
initial questionnaire), individual clinical interviews were conducted. The
entire procedure took place during two academic years (1988–1990).

Stage I: Whole Population Survey

Under the George Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe, the
INSERM (U 472) conducted an epidemiological survey of a representative sample of school attendees (Ledoux et al., 1991). All students
(N = 3,527) from 153 classes that were randomly selected in the junior
high schools, high schools, and vocational schools of the Chaumont
and Langres districts in the department of Haute-Marne in France
were asked to participate in the study. Each student filled out a selfreport questionnaire, including 280 multiple-choice questions on
demographic and social status, education, somatic and mental health
symptoms (emotional and behavioral problems, suicidal thoughts, eating and sleep problems), substance use (tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs),
aspects of daily life (leisure, sexual relationships), help-seeking behavior, prescriptions of psychotropic drugs, life events, and quality of

family relationships (for details, see Gasquet et al., 1997). Depressive
symptoms were assessed on the Kandel Depressive Mood Inventory
(Kandel and Davies, 1982), translated and validated in French
(Gasquet, 1996). In the selected classes, 3,311 students aged 11 to 20
years (i.e., 93.9% of the total population) participated in the survey.
The reason for nonparticipation was either refusal by the student or his
family or absence from school the day the study took place. The students filled out the questionnaire during a regular classroom period
under the supervision of a school nurse. Completion time was 1 to 2
hours, depending on the student’s academic level. Anonymous questionnaires were sealed and sent to the INSERM (U 472). Data from
sociodemographic questions (sex, date, and place of birth) were kept
on a nominative list by the school nurses and used to select subjects for
stage II interviews. A total of 3,287 questionnaires (93.2% of targeted
population) were considered valid for analysis.

Stage II: Clinical Interviews

Based on answers to the self-report questionnaire, three groups of
subjects were selected for stage II clinical examination. Group 1 (n =
59) consisted of students with eating disorder symptoms. Group 2 (n =
62) included students with total score of 17 or 18 (maximum score =
18) on the Kandel Depressive Mood Inventory and those hospitalized
for suicide attempt during the previous 12 months. Group 3 (n = 121)
was a control group, randomly selected from students who did not fulfill criteria for either group 1 or group 2 but were matched to each subject from both groups for age, sex, and school level. For logistic and
financial reasons, we chose not to interview students enrolled in rural
schools (which were too far from the two main towns of the district)
and students in the final grade of schooling at stage I (grade 9 in junior
high school, grade 12 in high school or vocational school), who had left
school by the time stage II was undertaken.
Semistructured clinical interviews (lasting 1–1[1]⁄2 hours) were conducted at school by seven psychiatrists and one clinical psychologist,
with French versions of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and
Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Epidemiologic version (KSADS-E) (Chambers et al., 1985), the Children’s Global Assessment
Scale (CGAS) (Shaffer et al., 1983), and sections developed by the
investigators on psychosocial adaptation, puberty, and treatment
seeking. All clinicians had been trained to use these instruments and
were blind to students’ screening status. Interrater reliability for
_DSM-III-R diagnoses, assessed by exchanging records between pairs_
of clinicians, was satisfactory (κ = 0.73 for major depression and 0.76
for dysthymia). In addition, each student completed a brief selfreport questionnaire with information regarding school, health, substance use, and a list of life events during the prior 12 months.
Among subjects selected for clinical evaluation, 76%, 87%, and
91% could be interviewed for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (participation rates not statistically different between groups). Nonparticipants included 15 students who had left school, 4 who refused the
interview, and 14 who were sick or absent for other reasons for at least
two consecutive appointments. Absenteeism did not differ between
groups, and responses on various items of the initial questionnaire (on
school, somatic problems, conduct problems, family relationships,
etc.) did not differentiate subjects who were interviewed from those
who were not.
From the 209 adolescents interviewed, 205 (84.7% of subjects eligible for stage II) provided valid data. According to lifetime diagnosis
of mood disorder, three groups were considered: subjects with major
depression (n = 49), subjects with dysthymia and without major
depression (n = 21), and subjects with no mood disorder (n = 135).
Results on subjects with eating disorders have been published elsewhere (Flament et al., 1995).

Statistical Analysis

A priori hypotheses were the following: (1) phenomenology of
symptoms and comorbidity differ between major depression and dysthymia; (2) both disorders have similar morbidity; and (3) treatment
seeking is low for both.
Subjects with major depression, dysthymia, or no mood disorder
were compared with the SAS package. Depending on the type of variable examined, we considered either groups with lifetime diagnoses
(e.g., for phenomenology, comorbidity) or groups with current diagnoses (e.g., for CGAS, events within the past 12 months). Qualitative
variables were compared with the χ[2] test, with and without the Yates
corrections, or Fisher exact test, as required by the size of expected frequencies. For quantitative data, intergroup comparisons were performed with the Student t test. Since the three groups did not differ in
age, sex, and socioeconomic status (Table 1), those variables were not
entered in the analyses. For variables in which one or both depressed
groups differed from controls, we looked within the depressed groups
(one or both groups combined, as appropriate) for the effects of single
versus multiple episodes, duration of the disorder, double depression,
and comorbidity.
All tests were two-tailed, with a p value less than .05 considered
significant.

Sociodemographic Characteristics of Subjects

Respondents were aged 13 to 21 years, and more than
95% had started puberty; 70% lived with both natural
parents. There was an overrepresentation of girls (female

male ratio = 4:1) because of sampling design. Table 1
shows sociodemographic characteristics of subjects with
lifetime diagnosis of depression or no mood disorder.
Eleven subjects (16% of those with mood disorder) had
double depression, as defined by Keller and Shapiro
(1982); they were included in the major depression
group. Fourteen subjects (29%) in the major depression
group had had more than one lifetime major depressive
episode (12 [25%] had had two; 2 [4%] had had three).

Phenomenology of Depressive Symptoms

Mean ages at onset of major depression (mean ± SD =
14.8 ± 2.4 years) and dysthymia (13.8 ± 3.1 years) were
similar (t = 1.29, p = .1). Mean duration of current major
depressive episode was 5.9 months (range, 3 weeks to 21
months), and mean duration of current dysthymia was
close to 3 years (range, 1–10 years) (t = 6.07, p = .006).
The frequency of all depressive symptoms was higher
(p < .01) in subjects with lifetime diagnoses of either
major depression or dysthymia than in controls (e.g.,
depressed mood: 96% in major depression, 100% in dysthymia, 43% in controls; loss of weight/appetite: 37%,
19%, 9%, respectively; increase in weight/appetite: 37%,
38%, 19%; insomnia: 90%, 67%, 15%; anhedonia: 90%,
76%, 27%; lack of energy: 90%, 62%, 24%; feelings of
worthlessness: 78%, 57%, 18%; social withdrawal: 71%,
62%, 17%; suicidal thoughts: 45%, 43%, 13%). Subjects
with major depression and those with dysthymia differed
only in frequency of insomnia (p = .034), lack of energy
(p = .01), and the number of symptoms reported (9.6 ±
1.9 versus 8.1 ± 1.9, respectively, t = 2.46, p = .016). Similarly, the number of symptoms reported was greater in
subjects with mood disorders than in controls (2.66 ±
3.2). However, the rate of depressive symptoms was high
in controls, with more than 50% having at least one lifetime symptom and 30% at least one current symptom.

Lifetime Prevalence of Comorbid Psychiatric Disorders
and Pathological Behaviors

Most anxiety disorders and bulimia nervosa tended to
be more frequent in subjects with affective disorders than
in controls (Table 2). Generalized anxiety disorder was significantly more frequent in both forms of affective disorders (p < .001), while separation anxiety disorder and
phobic disorder were associated with major depression (p <
.001). Only two adolescents (one with major depression,
one with dysthymia) had histories of manic episodes and
were diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

In subjects with major depression, the frequency of
suicide attempts and alcohol intoxication was higher
than in controls (p < .001 and p = .04, respectively), and
the frequency of illicit drug use tended to be higher (p =
.08). Other pathological behaviors, including stealing,
forgery, running away from home, school truancy, acts of
cruelty, vandalism, and other delinquency, were associated with neither major depression nor dysthymia. Only
school suspension (p < .05) and chronic violation of rules
at home or at school (p < .001) appeared significantly
associated with major depression and pathological lying
with dysthymic disorder (p = .03).
Compared with subjects who had a single mood disorder, those with double depression had higher rates (p <
.05) of suicide attempts (46%) and pathological behaviors
(rule violation 46%, pathological lying 40%). Comorbidity with anxiety disorders did not affect frequency of


pathological behaviors. Relative to subjects with single episodes of major depression, those with recurrent episodes
had higher rates of separation anxiety disorder (50% versus
18%, p = .03) and generalized anxiety disorder (39% versus 15%, p = .11).

Stressors and Life Events

The K-SADS-E interview records frequency and severity of psychosocial stressors at the onset of depression. If
both lifetime major depression and dysthymia were
frequently associated with stressors at onset, in major
depression the rate (85.7% versus 61.9%, Fisher exact
test, p = .053) and severity of stressors (3.6 ± 1.47 versus
2.72 ± 1.4, t = 2.32, p = .023) were greater.
In addition, on self-report of life events during the previous 12 months, personal events (i.e., illness, hospitalization, accident) did not appear to be associated with

current affective disorder, while experiences of loss or
threat of loss were significantly more frequent in subjects
with major depression (death of a close relative, parental
separation, family disruption) and dysthymic disorder (illness, hospitalization, or death of a close relative) (Table 3).
There was no age trend in the frequency of life events.

Current Psychosocial Functioning

Globally, psychosocial functioning (CGAS score, mean
± SD) was similar in subjects with current major depression or dysthymia (62 ± 14.2 versus 67 ± 10.3, respectively,
_t = 26, p = .35) and significantly impaired compared with_
controls with no current psychiatric diagnosis (84 ± 11;
major depressive versus control subjects, t = –5.2, p <
.0001; dysthymic versus control subjects, t = –6.32, p <
.0001). Among subjects with current dysthymia (but not
among those with current major depression), the CGAS
score was negatively correlated with duration of the disorder (Pearson r = –0.74, p = .006).
There were no significant differences between depressed
subjects and controls regarding academic performance


(Table 3), but subjects with major depression reported
school difficulties related to their mood disorder more
frequently than did subjects with dysthymia (57.1% versus
14.3%, respectively, χ[2] = 10.9, p = .001). The dysthymic
subjects had poor family relationships (with mother,
father, and siblings) more frequently than controls, and
they were less active in sports (Table 3).

Treatment Seeking

Only 34.7% of subjects with major depression and
23.8% of those with dysthymia had received medical
attention for their mood disorder. Only 16% of the subjects with major depression and 5% of the dysthymic subjects had ever had contact with a psychiatrist (Table 4); on
most treatment modalities, the major depressive subjects
differed from controls, whereas the dysthymic subjects
did not. Notably, many adolescents with major depression
had been given sedative drugs.
There was no difference in the frequency of any treatment received according to number of major depressive
episodes or diagnosis of double versus single depression.

Depressed subjects with a history of suicide attempts (n =
19), compared with those without (n = 54), had more
outpatient psychiatric visits (38% versus 7%, p = .008)
and tended to have been hospitalized more frequently for
psychological problems (23% versus 5%, p = .073) and
to have received antidepressant treatment more often
(15% versus 2%, p = .086).

**DISCUSSION**

Methodology and Study Limitations

Prior to discussing results, some limitations of this
study should be mentioned. First, the study design did
not permit an estimate of the prevalence of affective disorders in adolescents. Individuals who received diagnoses
of major depression or dysthymia at stage II appeared to
be distributed across all three groups at stage I, because
high scores on the Kandel Depressive Mood Inventory
identify subjects with current depressive symptoms but
do not screen for all current (and a fortiori past) cases of
mood disorders. Furthermore, many adolescent girls (n =
14) reporting eating disorder symptoms at stage I had
diagnoses of affective disorder at stage II. This may
explain our elevated female-male ratio and the relatively
high frequency of depressed girls suffering from bulimia
nervosa. Second, subjects with current and past depression were often combined for comparisons with other
groups. Third, the study used a lifetime diagnostic instrument, leading to frequent retrospective diagnoses. This is
a strong limitation, as a retrospective approach usually
underestimates many factors. Fourth, the list of life
events assessed was limited (not including, notably, his

tory of sexual abuse or physical neglect). Finally, due to
confidentiality and feasibility issues, parents were not
interviewed about their children.

Phenomenology of Symptoms

Major depression and dysthymic disorder have very
close symptomatology. This is not surprising as they share
common diagnostic criteria in current psychiatric classifications. However, our investigation included numerous
variables (i.e., pathological behaviors) which are not clinical criteria of either major depression or dysthymia. Only
a few clinical variables were significantly associated with
one specific form of affective disorder: insomnia, lack of
energy, suicide attempt, school suspension, and disobedience were associated with major depression, and duration of illness was associated with dysthymia. Although
the association of suicidal behavior with major depression
and duration of illness with dysthymia are expected, the
finding that depressed individuals reported frequent disobedience is more surprising. Kovacs et al. (1994) found
disobedience to be frequent in dysthymic disorder. Our
rate (30%) of dysthymic individuals, who had a comorbid diagnosis of major depression resulting in a so-called
“double depression,” is lower than the rate (nearly 70%)
reported in two previous studies (Ferro et al., 1994;
Kovacs et al., 1994) but higher than that (17%) in the
most recent report (Goodman et al., 2000).
Our results also highlight the frequency of symptoms
of affective disorders and feelings belonging to the depressive spectrum in normal adolescents (30%). These findings are similar to those previously reported (McClure
et al., 1997; Roberts et al., 1995). Horwath et al. (1992)

FLAMENT ET AL.

estimated that 50% of adults with depressive symptoms
are at risk of developing major depression. It can reasonably be assumed that adolescents carry a similar risk. This is
important because of the unfortunate prevailing belief
that depression during adolescence is normal and does not
need to be treated.

Comorbidity

In adolescents with depressive disorders, comorbidity
with anxiety disorders was high, especially with generalized anxiety disorder, phobic disorder, and separation
anxiety disorder. This finding supports previous studies,
in both clinical (e.g., Biederman et al., 1995; Ryan et al.,
1987) and community samples (e.g., Angold and
Costello, 1993; Kovacs et al., 1994; Lewinsohn et al.,
1995; Rhode et al., 1991). We cannot exclude that
comorbidity of major depression with bulimia nervosa
could be partly explained by the study design (which
overselected for stage II subjects with eating problems).
Nevertheless, although few epidemiological studies on
affective disorders in adolescents include systematic
search for eating disorders, increasing evidence of a relationship between major depression and eating disorders
exists in clinical samples (Lilenfeld et al., 1998). Unlike
in previous U.S. studies, especially those conducted in
urban sites (Angold and Costello, 1993; Birmaher et al.,
1996; Rey, 1994), we found few individuals with conduct
disorder among adolescents with affective disorders. Two
hypotheses may explain this finding: first, this comorbidity is more frequent in boys than in girls (Lewinsohn
et al., 1995; Rey, 1994), and our female-male ratio is
high; second, urbanization was low in the districts where
the survey was conducted. Adolescents with major
depression reported more episodes of alcohol intoxication and tended to use illicit drugs more frequently than
controls. These data are consistent with previous research
showing a link between depression and substance use
among adolescents (Galaif et al., 1998). However, crosssectional data does not permit the assessment of the temporal relationship between the two.

Psychosocial Functioning

Our results show that psychosocial functioning is significantly impaired in both major depression and dysthymic disorder. While impairment has been widely
documented in adolescent major depression (i.e., PuigAntich et al., 1993), to our knowledge few studies have
focused on psychosocial consequences of adolescent dys

thymia (Goodman et al., 2000; Hoberman et al., 1996;
Olsson et al., 1999). Several reports have suggested that
adolescents with two or more depressive episodes have
poorer functioning than those with a single episode (Rao
et al., 1995; Warner et al., 1995). In this study, the duration of dysthymic disorder negatively correlated with
psychosocial functioning. Similarly, in a study by Olsson
et al. (1999), adolescents with long-lasting depressive
symptoms had more limited social interaction, and in the
study by Goodman et al. (2000), subjects with double
depression were more impaired than those with a single
diagnosis. These findings emphasize the need for early
diagnosis and treatment of adolescent dysthymia, before
it becomes chronic or major depression develops (Kovacs
et al., 1994). This is additionally supported by the findings in a long-term outcome study by Klein et al. (1997):
compared with subjects with history of major depression
or nonaffective disorder in adolescence, those with a history of dysthymia had the poorest outcome as adults.

Environmental and Family Factors

Along with other reports on factors associated with
onset and duration of major depression and dysthymia,
our results suggest that stressful life events and family dysfunction play an important role in affective disorders of
adolescence (Birmaher et al., 1996; Goodyer et al., 1997).
However, our findings also suggest that major depression
and dysthymic disorder in adolescents may be linked to
distinct patterns of associated factors, with regard to experiences of loss and family climate. This last point was
recently reported by Olsson et al. (1999) in a case-control
study, but it was not supported by Goodman et al. (2000).
Additional discussion on the subject is outside of the scope
of this study but would deserve specific research.

Treatment Seeking

Psychosocial factors associated with help seeking
among adolescents reporting depressive feelings (stage I of
the study) have been published elsewhere: girls, older adolescents, adolescents with parents living apart, adolescents
with health worries, adolescents with suicidal ideation,
and adolescents frequently absent from school all sought
help more often than others (Gasquet et al., 1997). However, at stage II of the study, our results confirm the low
rate of adolescents with mood disorders who benefit from
specific care for their disorder. The U.S. studies have
emphasized the limitation to help seeking due to socioeconomic factors (Newacheck, 1989; Saunders et al.,


**1076** J. AM. ACAD. CHILD ADOLESC. PSYCHIATRY, 40:9, SEPTEMBER 2001

1994). However, in France, where the health care system
covers nearly all adolescents and provides free access to
medical care, we found the same level of untreated adolescents with affective disorders (nearly 70%) as in the U.S.
studies (79% and 82% according to Lewinsohn et al.

[1994] and Keller et al. [1991], respectively). Our results
are also surprising if we take into account the fact that
80% of all adolescents had outpatient visits with general
practitioners during the previous year (Gasquet et al.,
1997). We can therefore hypothesize that there are other
factors which may explain that major depression and dysthymia are underdiagnosed and undertreated in adolescents. Regarding the health system in France, these factors
might be the following: (1) low sensitivity of general practitioners to mental disorders, at least in adolescents; (2)
reluctance of parents to encourage professional help seeking or of family physicians to refer to a psychiatrist; (3)
lack of training in adolescent psychopathology; (4) poor
knowledge of evidence-based treatment for depression in
this age group, leading to inadequate prescriptions; (5) the
possibility of stigma associated with mental illness. However, it is likely that other factors also contribute to a low
level of mental health care among adolescents, including
youth attitudes toward help sources and the nature of
depressive symptomatology (Hoberman et al., 1996). It is
interesting to note that depressed subjects who had
attempted suicide had received more psychiatric outpatient treatment than those who had not attempted suicide.
Although we have no way of knowing whether treatment
was directly related to suicide attempt, it seems likely that
suicidality might have brought these youngsters to the
attention of medical authorities.

Clinical Implications

Together with other recent reports, the results presented
provide strong evidence that major depression and dysthymia are underdiagnosed and undertreated in adolescence,
although their consequences on psychosocial functioning
are severe. Our results also suggest that major depression
and dysthymia, although they share similar clinical features, may have distinct patterns of associated factors.
There is some evidence that duration of illness affects psychosocial consequences in adolescents with mood disorders, which emphasizes the need for early identification
and effective treatment. Despite free access to health care
in France, the rate of treatment seeking for mood disorder
is similar to that reported in U.S. sites, suggesting that factors other than socioeconomic variables are involved.
