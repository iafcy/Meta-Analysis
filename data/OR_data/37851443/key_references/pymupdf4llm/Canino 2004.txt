**Background: Few prevalence studies in which DSM-IV**
criteria were used in children in representative community samples have been reported. We present prevalence data for the child and adolescent population of
Puerto Rico and examine the relation of DSM-IV diagnoses to global impairment, demographic correlates, and
service use in an island-wide representative sample.

**Methods: We sampled 1886 child-caretaker dyads in**
Puerto Rico by using a multistage sampling design. Children were aged 4 to 17 years. Response rate was 90.1%.
Face-to-face interviews of children and their primary caretakers were performed by trained laypersons who administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, version IV (DISC-IV) in Spanish. Global impairment
was measured by using the Children’s Global Assessment Scale scored by the interviewer of the parent. Reports of service use were obtained by using the Service
Assessment for Children and Adolescents.


to 6.9% when a measure of global impairment was added
to that definition. The most prevalent disorders were attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (8.0%) and oppositional defiant disorder (5.5%). Children in urban settings had higher rates than those in rural regions. Older
age was related to higher rates of major depression and
social phobia, and younger age was related to higher rates
of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Both overall
rates and rates of specific DSM-IV/DISC-IV disorders were
related to service use. Children with impairment without diagnosis were more likely to use school services,
whereas children with impairment with diagnosis were
more likely to use the specialty mental health sector. Of
those with both a diagnosis and global impairment, only
half received services from any source.

**Conclusions: Because we used the DISC-IV to apply**
_DSM-IV criteria, the study yielded prevalence rates that_
are generally comparable with those found in previous
surveys. The inclusion of diagnosis-specific impairment
criteria reduced rates slightly. When global impairment
criteria were imposed, the rates were reduced by approximately half.


**Results: Although 19.8% of the sample met DSM-IV cri-** criteria reduced rates slightly. When global impairment

ous and impairing conditions (eg, schizophrenia and other
psychotic disorders) excepted.[11] The implications of these
revisions in the DSM have only begun to be explored empirically for both adult[12] and childhood[9,13] disorders, although the revisions have generated considerable theoretical debate.[14,15]
The explicit clinical significance requirement has led
to the development of epidemiological diagnostic instruments based on the DSM-IV that for the first time make
clinical significance a prerequisite for each of the disorders measured. When impairment in functioning was not
taken into account, a number of epidemiological studies
that applied DSM-III and DSM-III-R criteria[4,5,16] reported
prevalence rates higher than 30% for diagnosable mental
disorders.Althoughsuchhighrateswerenotuniversalfindings, they suggested that the DSM-III and DSM-III-R, as
operationalized in certain structured diagnostic instruments, tended to be overly inclusive.[17-19] It is still not clear
the extent to which these findings are caused by characteristics of the taxonomy or to the way in which the taxonomy is operationalized in instruments.
New measurement procedures have been developed to implement the clinical significance and other criteria changes in the DSM-IV, and several of the procedures are designed for assessing persons in community
samples and/or in primary care settings.[20,21] Although there
are still a number of substantial and unresolved issues
regarding valid and reliable assessment of psychiatric status and functioning in children and adolescents,[8,10-22] it
is important to inform the discussion of these issues by
presenting systematic data collected by using the latest
measures and the latest diagnostic criteria. Few epidemiological studies of prevalence rates of child psychiatric disorders and their correlates based on DSM-IV criteria have been reported.[23]
To add to the pool of data regarding how DSM-IV
criteria apply to general population samples, we present
findings about the prevalence and correlates of child and
adolescent disorders defined according to the DSM-IV in
a representative sample of children aged 4 to 17 years on
the island of Puerto Rico who were interviewed between 1999 and 2000. The DSM-IV diagnoses were operationally determined by using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, version IV (DISC-IV).[24] The
DISC-IV has added questions to assess the clinical significance (impairment or distress) to the diagnostic schedules of each of the disorders it measures. To illustrate the
importance of including clinical significance as 1 of the
criteria that defines each psychiatric disorder, we highlight the issue of clinical significance by reporting DSM-IV
disorders with and without disorder-specific impairmentdistress criteria. The issue of impairment is further examined by considering information from a global impairment rating, the Parent Interview–Children’s Global
Assessment Scale (PIC-GAS).[18]
We considered it important to include both the measure of specific impairment and the global measure for several reasons. First, the assessment of specific impairment,
such as that obtained with the DISC-IV, is a subjective rating requiring that the respondent establish a causal connection between the symptoms of a specific diagnosis and
resultingimpairmentordistress.Althoughtheseratingshave


demonstrated reliability, the accuracy with which parents or children can make the attribution of impairment
to the specific symptoms has never been validated and is
therefore open to question.[26] We wanted to provide different alternatives for assessing impairment and elected to use
the global measure, PIC-GAS, which has demonstrated reliability and validity.[18]
Another consideration for including both measures was that the DISC impairment measures also incorporate an item that relates to distress caused by the
symptoms. In attempting to adhere to DSM-IV criteria,
we considered it important to include the notion of distress, as well as that of impairment. We also wanted to
measure need for mental health services by using a definition of need for services that includes meeting criteria
for a disorder and substantial impairment in functioning. Because clinical significance is such an important issue, we did not want to rely exclusively on a single measure. Moreover, the rating of global impairment takes into
account all aspects of the child’s overall functioning,
whereas the DISC schedules used in the present study
include only a selected group of DSM-IV disorders. It is
conceivable, for example, that a child with autism or another serious developmental disorder not included in the
DISC could have results negative for the DISC diagnoses being considered, as well as for diagnosis-specific
impairment on the DISC-IV, and still be substantially impaired in functioning.
Besides reporting last-year prevalence rates of selected DSM-IV disorders, with and without clinical significance criteria, we report rates of mental health service use among those with and those without targeted
_DSM-IV diagnoses. The patterns of service use not only_
provide useful information for policy makers who use
prevalence estimates, but they also provide insights into
the interpretation of both diagnostic and impairment information.
There are several advantages in studying DSM-IV/
DISC-IV diagnoses in a representative island-wide sample
of the Puerto Rican population. This population includes the full spectrum of socioeconomic status, with
children living in different contexts of economic advantage and poverty in both urban and rural areas. The sample
obtained for the present study represents the full range
of diversity of the child population. These factors enhance the generalizability of the findings. Although Puerto
Rico clearly differs from mainland American populations in language, culture, and distribution of risk factors, prevalence studies of both adult and child psychiatric disorder performed in Puerto Rico have shown
remarkable similarity to overall trends in the United
States.[16,27-30]
Most child psychiatric epidemiological studies have
focused on a narrow age range or on specific age groups.[17]
Our study includes children from a broad age range of 4
to 17 years. We are able to analyze patterns of association between rates of disorder and sex, parental education, family income, and urban vs rural residence to verify
if relations between psychiatric disorder and these demographic factors are similar to those found elsewhere, as
well as to findings of an island-wide child study of DSM_III disorders performed in 1985.[16]_

**METHODS**


**SAMPLE DESCRIPTION AND PARTICIPANTS**

An island-wide household probability sample of children aged
4 to 17 years was drawn from 4 strata: Puerto Rico’s health reform areas, urban vs rural areas, participant age, and participant sex. Block groups defined in the US Bureau of the Population and Housing 1990 Census for Puerto Rico were the
primary sampling units. These groups were classified according to economic level and size, grouped into block clusters, and
further classified as urban or rural.
Clusters of households were randomly selected from each
stratum, households with children aged 4 to 17 years were selected from the clusters, and 1 child was selected from each
household by using Kish tables[31] adjusted for age and sex. From
2102 eligible households, 1886 parent-child dyads were interviewed for a total response rate of 90.1%.
The sample was weighted to represent the general population of children in Puerto Rico in the year 2000. The weights
correct for differences in the probability of selection because
of the sampling design and adjust for nonresponse. To account for the complex sampling design, SEs were estimated
(SUDAAN software release 8.0; Research Triangle Institute,
Durham, NC).
**Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the**
sample before poststratification. The distribution by age and
sex of the sample obtained is similar to that of the Puerto Rican
population as described in the 2000 US census. The final sample
of 1897 children constituted a sampling fraction of approximately 2.2 per 1000 children in the population.

**INSTRUMENTS AND MEASURES**

**The DISC-IV**

Last-year DSM-IV psychiatric disorders were assessed by using the latest translation into Spanish of the DISC-IV,[25] with
parallel youth and parent interview versions. The test-retest reliability of the DISC-IV has been reported in both Spanishspeaking and English-speaking clinic samples and yielded comparable results.[24,25]
The DISC-IV inquires about the level of impairment and
distress associated with each diagnosis through probes that determine the degree to which the symptoms of a given diagnosis have caused distress to the child or affected his or her school
functioning or relations with caretakers, family, friends, or teachers. The test-retest reliability of the impairment and distress
probes were fair to moderate; most � values ranged from 0.42
to 0.80 for most disorders assessed.[25]
Children younger than 11 years were not interviewed with
the DISC because there is evidence that their reports would not
be reliable.[32] The substance abuse disorders schedules were administered in children aged 11 to 17 years but not to their parents, whereas oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) was excluded from the child protocol. Parents tend to be unaware of
the use of substances in their adolescent children and are not
considered good sources of information for substance use disorders in their children. Results of prior studies in which Puerto
Rican and mainland samples were included have also shown
poor reliability for ODD in child reports, as well as poor concordance with clinical diagnosis.[33]
The official DISC-IV scoring algorithms use data from parent and child informants and allow the ascertainment of the presenceofadiagnosis,withorwithoutimpairmentasmeasuredwith
the DISC impairment scales. In this article, we use the DISC impairment algorithm that refers to moderate impairment in at least
1 area of functioning. The rates reported include both parent and

child informants for children aged 11 to 17 years, and only parent informants for children younger than 11 years. A case is considered positive if it meets full DSM-IV diagnostic criteria according to either the parent or child DISC-IV.

**The PIC-GAS**

Overall global impairment in functioning was measured by using the PIC-GAS. The PIC-GAS is the lay version of the Children’s Global Assessment Scale.[18] The concurrent, discriminant, and construct validity of the PIC-GAS have been reported
by using combined data from 4 communities, including data
from Puerto Rico.[18] Although the PIC-GAS is presented in 10
deciles that describe different levels of functioning, the instructions for assigning scores on the PIC-GAS, as well as on the
_DSM-IV Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, specifically_
encourage raters to “use intermediary levels.” Previous psychometric work with the clinician Children’s Global Assessment Scale[34] revealed that a score lower than 65 was the best
cutoff to distinguish between those definitely impaired and those
not impaired. Similar psychometric work with the PIC-GAS
shows that with lay raters, a score lower than 69 is optimal to
identify children who are impaired in functioning.[18]
To our knowledge, none of the publications available have
shown empirically derived cutoff scores to distinguish those who
are mildly, moderately, or severely impaired. Therefore, we have
opted to use a cutoff lower than 69 on the PIC-GAS coupled with
diagnosis-specific impairment ratings to operationalize the classification of serious emotional disturbance that is considered by
theUSfederalgovernmentinreimbursingstatesformentalhealth
services.[35] This definition requires the presence of a DSM-IV diagnosis with substantial impairment in functioning.

**Service Assessment for Children and Adolescents**

The Spanish-language version of the Service Assessment for Children and Adolescents (SACA)[36] was used to ascertain the types
of services and treatments used by children for emotional, alcohol, and drug problems. The instrument inquires about lifetime and last-year use of 25 specific service settings that are
divided among inpatient-residential, outpatient, and school settings.[37] The outpatient setting is disaggregated into mental health
outpatient and general health outpatient. The mental health outpatient includes patients who attended a mental health or substance abuse clinic or saw a professional in a private office. The
Spanish-language SACA has shown fair to moderate reliability, with most � values ranging from 0.41 to 0.87 for most services reported by parents and children, as well as moderate to
substantial sensitivity when parental reports were compared
without medical records.[36] The SACA has 2 versions (parent
and child), and use of services was considered positive if a positive response was given by either parent or child.

**PROCEDURES**

The survey was performed from January 1999 through December 2000. The child’s biological mother was the adult informant in 89.4% of the cases. Interviews took place in the subject’s home, with different interviewers for parent and child,
and interviewers were blinded to the results of each other’s interviews. Interviews were audio taped, and 15% were spotchecked for quality control.


**RESULTS**


**PREVALENCE RATES WITH**
**AND WITHOUT IMPAIRMENT**

**Table 2 presents the last-year prevalence rates of spe-**
cific DSM-IV/DISC-IV disorders for children aged 4 to
17 years. Prevalence is reported in 4 ways. The first column shows the presence of DISC diagnostic criteria in
either parent or child report, without taking clinical significance (impairment and distress resulting from symptoms) into account. The rates reported in the second column qualify the column 1 diagnoses by requiring at least
1 level of DISC-IV impairment or distress according to
either parent or child. Therefore, the values in the second column refer to disorders that meet full DSM-IV criteria. The third column presents rates based on the presence of criteria for diagnosis in either parent or child
without the DISC impairment criteria but with global im

pairment as measured with the PIC-GAS with a score
lower than 69. The rates appearing in the fourth column require the presence of DISC-IV criteria for diagnosis according to either parent or child, with DISC-IV
impairment and a global impairment score lower than
69 on the PIC-GAS.
The proportion of the sample that appeared to have
met all DSM-IV criteria except for the impairment criterion is 19.8% (first column of Table 2). Prevalence rates
are all greater without impairment than when impairment is considered. The second column is a more faithful representation of DSM-IV criteria, in that it requires
both diagnosis and some degree of specific impairment
or distress to be present. When all diagnoses assessed with
some impairment are considered (second column), 16.4%
of the sample has 1 or more DSM-IV diagnoses. The specific diagnosis with the highest prevalence is attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (8.0%), followed
by ODD (5.5%), separation anxiety (3.1%), and major
depression (3.0%).
In contrast, the third column shows the prevalence
rates when global impairment (PIC-GAS score lower
than 69) is substituted for the DISC-IV disorder-specific impairment criteria. The rates in this column are
not consistent with the full DSM-IV criteria, in that they
take into account clinical significance of mental disorder as measured with global impairment instead of impairment due to specific symptoms. The rate for any di

agnosis is reduced from 16.4% to 7.6% (third column).
For both overall prevalence and the diagnostic groupings, the effect of the global impairment qualification,
as compared with the standard DSM-IV/DISC-IV definition that includes the DISC impairment scales, tends to
reduce the prevalence rate much more (about half). In
the fourth column, both global impairment and the
DISC-IV disorder-specific impairment criteria are included in the designation of a case, and the rate is reduced slightly from 7.6% to 6.9%.

**DEMOGRAPHIC CORRELATES**

Prior to the development of the DSM-IV, a number of
demographic factors were shown to relate to child psychiatric disorder.[30,38,39] To determine which of these correlates of the diagnoses remain after the application of
_DSM-IV/DISC-IV criteria, we report in Table 3 associa-_
tions of the more prevalent disorders with age, sex, parental education, household income, parental civil status, and urban vs rural residence. Odds ratios (ORs) were
estimated by using logistic regression models that


weighted the data for the sample design poststratified to
the 2000 census results (SUDAAN).
Boys had more disruptive disorders (OR=1.6),
ADHD (OR=2.0), and ODD (OR=1.6), while girls had
more depressive disorders in general (OR=0.3) and specifically major depression (OR=0.4). Age had a mixed
pattern of associations with these childhood disorders.
Rates tended to increase with age for depressive disorders (OR=5.2), anxiety disorders (OR=1.7), social phobia (OR=2.4), and major depression (OR=4.6). Rates
tended to decrease with age for ADHD (OR=0.5), and
there was no reliable age association with any disruptive disorder, specifically conduct disorder and ODD, or
with separation anxiety disorder. Neither parental education nor income was related to any of the disorders assessed. Children whose parents were not married (single,
separated, widowed, or divorced) were more likely to meet
criteria for any studied DISC-IV disorder and major depressive disorder. In addition, children who lived in urban areas were more likely to meet criteria for any diagnosis (OR=1.9), any disruptive disorder (OR=1.9), and
ADHD (OR=2.1).

**SERVICE USE**


In Table 4, we show last-year service use rates for groups
of children cross classified according to whether they had
1 or more DSM-IV/DISC-IV diagnosis and whether they
had global impairment scores lower than 69. As ex

pected, children with DSM-IV diagnoses and impairment used the most services, but only half of the children (49.6%) in this group received any type of service.
Overall, school services were more frequently used than
any other service and were used by children who were
impaired regardless of whether they met DSM-IV/
DISC-IV criteria.
To further assess the relative power of DSM-IV/
DISC-IV and global impairment (PIC-GAS score lower
than 69) to predict service use, we performed a series of
logistic regression analyses. The results (Table 5) showed
that for all service categories except for any school service, use could be described in terms of main effects of
both diagnosis (present/absent) and global impairment
(present/absent). The DISC diagnosis and global impairment were both strongly associated with all types of service use, but the effects of global impairment were generally stronger than the effects of diagnosis, with the
exception of use of the specialty mental health sector (any
mental health professional), for which diagnosis had a
larger OR than did global impairment.
For any school service, the interaction term was significant. As shown in the Figure, about one third of children who had PIC-GAS scores lower than 69 received
school services, regardless of the presence of a diagnosis. Among those with no impairment and no diagnosis,
school services were used by 6.8%, and use increased to
17.6% among those with a diagnosis.

**COMMENT**


Our results are generally consistent with previous DSM_III_ prevalenceratesreportedfortheisland,[16] despitechanges
in the nosology and the new version of the DISC that was
used. In both the survey performed in 1985 and the current study, the relative frequency with which the disordersoccurredwassimilar,eventhoughtheprevalencerates
of the specific disorders were somewhat different. In both
surveys,ADHDandODDwereapproximatelytwiceascommon as were major depression, separation anxiety, social
phobia, generalized anxiety, and conduct disorder.
Nevertheless, we identified differences in prevalence rates across these studies that cannot be attributed solely to the application of a clinical significance
criterion such as was used in our present data set. These
differences in prevalence rates are likely to be influenced by differences in the methods used in the surveys. The 1985 DSM-III survey inquired about 6-month
prevalence rates rather than the year rates of the current
survey. It also combined information from child and
parent informants in all ages, whereas information from
both informants in the present survey was combined
only in the children aged 11 to 17 years. Furthermore,
the 1985 rates were based on clinical judgment by clinicians who used a prior version of the DISC to structure the interview, whereas in this study diagnoses were
estimated with a structured diagnostic interview used
by lay interviewers.
The DSM-IV/DISC-IV prevalence rates we report are
not fully consistent with those from a recently reported
_DSM-IV study performed among black and white youth_
in North Carolina. In that study, Angold et al[23] reported
lower rates of ADHD, ODD, and major depression than
those obtained in the present study, but they found higher
rates of conduct disorder and substance use. Several factors may help explain these differences. The lower rates
could be explained by the fact that the Angold et al[23] survey used an interviewer-based structured interview[19] different from the one we used. Moreover, they reported a
3-month prevalence rate rather than a 1-year prevalence
rate, and the children assessed were aged 9 to 17 years and
livinginruralareas.Theirstudyalsoincludedawiderrange
of psychiatric disorders than does the present study. Nevertheless,Angoldandcolleagues[23] performedfurtheranalyses of their data with the same diagnoses evaluated in the
present study (oral communication, November 2002) and
found rates of any DSM-IV disorder of 17.7% (95% confidence interval, 15%-20%) that are similar to the rate in
this study of 17.3% (95% confidence interval, 14.5%20.7%), when we excluded children aged 4 to 8 years from
our rates to make the analyses comparable.
Previous reports of rates of specific diagnoses based
on earlier versions of the DSM and in which the same
assessment instruments were used have shown few differences in rates between Puerto Rico and mainland localities, with 1 salient exception. The rates of conduct
disorder in both our 1985 survey[40] and in the Methods
for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental
Disorders study[26] have been compared with those obtained in mainland populations and were lower among
island Puerto Rican children and adolescents. Lower


rates of substance use disorders in both adult and adolescent populations have also been reported for island
Puerto Ricans, as compared with findings in mainland
populations.[41,42] The lower rates appear to be related to
the extent to which correlates of these disorders appear
on the island, the most salient being better family relations and social support.[26]
Similar to results of other surveys,[16,43,44] our study
results showed many of the expected associations of
ADHD, ODD, anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders with age and sex.[10,43,45] Unlike results of many studies of mental disorder among children and adolescents,[46-48] including the earlier study[16] in Puerto Rico, we
found no associations between rates of disorder and indicators of socioeconomic status, such as parents’ education and family income. This unexpected finding led
to further exploration. In one analysis, we constructed
levels of income with 3 categories used by Costello et al[46]
to define relative poverty: lowest third, middle third, and
upper third. In another analysis, we combined parental
income and education to define a familial high-risk group
that was low in both income and education. Neither of
these additional analyses revealed an association. However, our failure to find that prevalence varies with traditional measures of socioeconomic factors is consistent with results of a handful of studies that focused on
impoverished families.[23,49]
Beyond absolute and relative measures of poverty, we
considered perceptions of what constitutes poverty. FortyeightpercentofPuertoRicanslivebelowthepovertylevel.[50]
Our survey showed that only 22.2% of parents with an annualincomebelow$12000consideredthattheylivedpoorly
orverypoorly,while42.8%ofthosethoughttheylivedwell
or very well. Of parents in the $12001 to $25000 income
level, 13.2% thought they lived poorly. When perception
of poverty was substituted for actual income, we found that
disruptive disorders (ADHD and ODD) were more frequent among those who reported that they lived poorly.
Perception of poverty was not related to either anxiety or
depressive disorders. This pattern is consistent with results in other studies[51,52] that reported stronger associationsbetweenpovertyandexternalizingdisordersthanwith
internalizing disorders. The findings suggest that absolute or relative poverty indexes may not be the most appropriate measures to use in populations where most persons are of low income. Further development of measures
of perceived poverty or the inclusion of measures of “social capital,”[53] such as the existence of job opportunities,
community organization, and other community resources, may be more fruitful.
We found that global impairment as indicated by a
PIC-GAS score lower than 69 was an important predictor of service use, even when adjusting for the presence
of a DSM-IV/DISC-IV disorder. Except for mental health
specialty services, global impairment appeared to be as
important, if not more important, than diagnosis in predicting service. For school service use, presence of a diagnosis was important only for children with PIC-GAS
scores of 69 or higher. Service use among children with
global impairment was the same for those with a diagnosis as for those without a diagnosis as measured in our
survey. It is possible that some of the children receiving


-----

school services had disorders, such as learning, motor
skills, and language disorders, that were not assessed in
our study. Such disorders could have been perceived by
counselors and teachers and therefore could have been
addressed in school. Children with impairment without
diagnosis may not have been eligible for specialty mental health treatment because they did not meet the eligibility criteria of severe emotional disturbance established by most states and insurance companies in both
the mainland United States and Puerto Rico (ie, meeting criteria for DSM-IV disorder and substantial
impairment).[35]
The importance of impairment in our study is not
simply a function of our use of logistic regression. Alegrı´a et al[54] found that impairment was the most important predictor of service use when parent decisions to seek
service were modeled by using classification and regression tree approaches.[55] Given that 13.3% of the children
in Puerto Rico were impaired (data not shown) and that
this seems to be such an important predictor of service
use, an important strategy for prevention interventions
and policy makers should be the identification of children with impairment and intervening with parents and
educators so that they can link impairment with the need
for mental health service.
As was shown in other research,[7,44] our data showed
that the inclusion of the DSM-IV clinical significance criterion with the diagnostic criteria of most Axis I diagnoses reduced the prevalence rates of disorders. The use
of specific impairment items reduced by 18% the prevalence from that obtained through criteria without impairmentanddistress.Rateswerereducedbyanadditional58%
when a global impairment measure was included. Several
investigators[5,7,56] noted that prevalence rates vary according to the impairment measure used. These findings suggest the need for a consensus about how clinical significance is conceptualized, operationalized, and measured for
both research and clinical purposes. Although progress has
been made in the conceptualization of impairment by the
World Health Organization in its International Classifica_tion of Functioning, Disability and Health,[57]_ further work
is needed to examine the applicability of this classification to children. Some of the discrepancies observed in
prevalence rates among studies might be the result of such
a lack of consensus; it may also contribute to the low level
of concordance frequently observed among clinicians on
clinical diagnostic assessments.
The reduction in prevalence rates observed when the
criterion of impairment and distress is introduced to the
diagnostic criteria does not necessarily challenge the validity of the DSM-IV. Some have argued that the inclusion of this criterion in most DSM-IV (Axis I) diagnoses
is unnecessary[11] because many disorders already include in their symptom criteria impairment in functioning. Nevertheless, the DSM-IV criteria, as implemented
in epidemiological interview measures that incorporate
impairment and distress, such as the DISC-IV, led to prevalence rates in Puerto Rico that serve as reasonable working hypotheses about the burden of mental disorders
among children and adolescents. The information provided by trained lay interviewers in a single assessment
session can only begin to approximate a full profes

sional assessment that uses behavioral observations, multiple informants, and, where available, biological tests.
Economical methods to assess mental health and impairment due to mental disorders, such as those used in
fieldsurveys,providetheopportunitytodeterminethecommonness of the signs and symptoms of disorders that are
proposed because of the nosology and to plan longitudinal studies of onset, course, and treatment of mental disorders. Perhaps more strikingly, these assessments are important tools for planning mental health services and for
assessing children with serious emotional disturbance in
the educational system. Although the inclusion of specific
clinical severity criteria in DSM-IV reduces prevalence estimates,theselowerratesdonotautomaticallytranslateinto
lower service needs. Results of a comprehensive assessment of both diagnosable psychiatric disorder and global
impairment suggest that services are needed for an important group of children who are below the threshold needed
foradiagnosisbutarenonethelessgloballyimpaired.These
findings, if replicated, have important implications for future revisions of the DSM-IV.
