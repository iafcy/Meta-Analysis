### Abstract


**PURPOSE—This study describes parent and adolescent perspectives on clinical need for and**
attitudes toward care for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and explores how these
views related to past year mental health service use.

**METHODS—Parent and adolescent interviews were conducted six years after school district**
screening for ADHD. Mental health service use, adolescent and parent perceived clinical need
(ADHD symptoms, disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety/depression, functioning) and enabling
attitudes (treatment receptivity, ADHD stigma) as well as parent factors (caregiver strain, distress,
instrumental social support) were assessed using standardized measures. Nested logistic regression
modeling was used to determine the hierarchical contribution of parent and adolescent
perspectives on past year service use, adjusting for prior mental health service use. Stepwise
regression was conducted to identify which variables were most predictive of service use.


**RESULTS—Most (79%) adolescents at high risk for ADHD had a history of lifetime mental**
health service use, but only 42% had received any mental health services in the past year. In
hierarchical modeling, only parent inattention ratings and medication receptivity and adolescent
ADHD stigma perceptions contributed significantly to improved model fit. Stepwise regression
confirmed these three predictors (OR 1.2, 3.8, and 0.2, respectively) and identified adolescentsreported functioning as an additional service use predictor (OR 1.1).


**CONCLUSION—Adolescents’ perceptions about stigma related to ADHD are influential in**
treatment receipt. Quality improvement interventions for adolescents with ADHD should include

psychoeducational interventions for adolescents and their parents that target medication receptivity
and stigma about ADHD.


### INTRODUCTION

More than one-half of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
continue to have symptoms and impairment during adolescence and young adulthood [1],
yet little is known about how individual and parent-level factors influence service use during
this key transitional period. The need for additional research [2] is underscored by the
absence of recommendations in national ADHD treatment guidelines on how care should be
tailored for adolescents and young adults [3,4]. In addition, quality improvement
interventions to promote continuous care for adolescents with ADHD are warranted because
medication and behavioral interventions in home and school settings have been found
effective [5,6], but older youth are more likely to drop out of treatment than their school-age
counterparts [7,8]. Under-treatment may also increase an adolescent’s risk for adverse longterm consequences for ADHD, such as school failure, juvenile justice involvement or motor
vehicle accidents [9–11]. Thus, it is of public health significance to further our
understanding of which factors improve the likelihood of adolescents with ADHD to receive
continuous care.

Based on the well established Behavioral Model of Access [12], access to ADHD treatment
during childhood has been shown to be influenced by factors at the individual, caregiver,
provider, and system levels [13,14]. Children from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds,
girls and children enrolled in publicly-funded health insurance plans are less likely to
receive stimulant medication treatment than children from Caucasian backgrounds, boys and
privately insured children [15]. Several caregiver factors also have emerged as predictors of
ADHD treatment for children. Highly stressed parents have been shown to seek more
medical care, particularly for their young children [16], and several studies have
documented high levels of parent stress and caregiver strain associated with ADHD [17,18].
Conversely, lower levels of parental social network support have been found to increase the
likelihood that parents seek ADHD treatment for their child [18].

Among adolescents with ADHD, the likelihood of receiving ADHD care may also be
influenced by an interplay of individual and caregiver factors that are unique to this
developmental stage. Earlier studies suggest that adolescents’ increasing treatment drop-out
and medication non-adherence rates may be attributable to both declining parental control
over adolescents’ health behavior and negative attitudes held by adolescents towards mental
health treatment [19]. Furthermore, substantial ADHD stigma concerns among participating
youth were identified in a recent nationally representative survey [20]. Such stigma
perceptions may impede help-seeking or promote discontinuation of treatment because
adolescents are developmentally sensitive about public opinions and seek peer approval.

Nevertheless, significant gaps exist on adolescents’ views about ADHD and mental health
care, how their perspectives may influence the continuity of mental health care, and how the
impact of adolescent perspectives on mental health service use compares to those of their
parents. This study therefore describes perceived clinical need and attitudes relevant to
ADHD care from both adolescent and parent treatment need perspectives and explores how
these influence a teen’s likelihood for receiving mental health services. We hypothesize that
parent perspectives, including perceptions of clinical need for care, treatment receptivity and
caregiver emotional and instrumental support increase the odds of past year mental health
service use. We also explore whether adolescent perspectives, especially treatment
receptivity and ADHD stigma perceptions, emerge as significant predictors of past year

mental health service use when adjusting for prior mental health service use, and
hypothesized parent factors.

### METHODS


**Participants and procedures**

This research uses data from a longitudinal cohort study assessing detection and access to
care for ADHD in a representative school district sample which followed participants in
multiple study waves between 1998 and 2006 [15]. Interviews for this report occurred in
2004 to 2005, on average 6.8 years (SD 0.47) after the initial screening, during study wave
4.


To identify students at high risk for ADHD, a random sample of children, oversampling
girls by a factor of two, was derived from public school records of 12,009 kindergarten
through fifth graders from a North Florida school district. Of 1,615 children screened, 29.5%
(n=476) were deemed at “high risk for ADHD” on enrollment if they: 1) were diagnosed or
treated for ADHD; 2) were considered by parent or teachers to have ADHD; or 3) elicited
behavioral concerns and had parent-reported scores on the Swanson-Nolan-and Pelham-IV
(SNAP-IV) [21] at or greater than 1.5 standard deviations above the norm. Subsequently
high risk students underwent diagnostic assessment for ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder
(ODD), and conduct disorder (CD) using the parent version of the NIMH Diagnostic
Interview Schedule for Children-4[th] version (DISC-4.0) at study wave 2 [22] or the KiddieSADS-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS PL) at study wave 4 [23]. For wave 4
interviews we interviewed 192 of 372 eligible adolescents (52%); 70 (19%) declined
participation and 110 (30%) were lost to follow-up. Study participants did not differ from
those who refused or were lost to follow-up on race, gender or poverty status. For 30 youths
who rejoined the study in adolescence and could have outgrown ADHD symptoms since
initial screening, we used the semi-structured K-SADS instead of the DISC-4 to ascertain
their ADHD diagnoses because we expected better performance for lifetime assessment. In
addition, for this analysis, 24 of the 192 adolescents interviewed were excluded because they
were unlikely to need ADHD treatment, as indicated by not meeting DSM-IV criteria for
ADHD, no prior lifetime history of ADHD treatment, and fewer than four ADHD symptoms
displayed at follow-up interview in 2004–2005.

Of the 168 adolescents studied, 53% were female (n=89), 35% were from African American
backgrounds (n=58), and 58% (n=97) qualified for free or reduced lunch status. Their
average age was 15.0 years (s.d. 1.67). Health insurance information was available for 113
or 168 adolescents and almost all (n=105 of 113, 93%) had health insurance coverage, onehalf (n = 58, 51%) through private sources and the remainder (n = 47, 42%) through public
insurance carriers. More than 60% (n=100, 61%) met full DSM-IV criteria for ADHD
during diagnostic interviews (combined subtype: n=53, 32%; inattentive subtype: n=34,
21%; hyperactive/impulsive subtype: n=13, 8%), and 74% (n=120) screened positive for
ADHD on the Vanderbilt Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Parent Rating Scale [24]
at the 2004–2005 follow-up interview.

The study was approved by the University Institutional Review Board and the school district
research office. Informed consent (parents and young adults) or child assent (adolescents)
were obtained from all subjects, who received a stipend of $40 (parents) or $30
(adolescents) for their participation. Trained research assistants conducted personal
interviews with parents and adolescents in homes, community locations, or at our research
center.

**Measurement**

**Predictors**


**Demographic information: Information about child age, gender, race, and poverty status**
was obtained from school registration records and verified at the study wave 1 interview.

**Parent perspectives**


**Clinical Need: The Vanderbilt Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Parent Rating Scale**
(VADPRS) was used to assess symptoms of ADHD, disruptive behavior and internalizing
disorders [24]. The 47-item VADPRS uses a 4-point scale (0 = never, 3 = very often).
Internal consistency and concurrent validity have been established [24]. Parents completed
the Columbia Impairment Scale (CIS), a 13-item measure of functioning using a 5-point
scale (0 = no problem, 4 = a very bad problem). The CIS has been reported to have high
internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .85) and test-retest reliability (r = .89) in an ethnically
and economically diverse child sample; scores above 14 are considered clinically relevant

[25].

**Treatment receptivity: Parents answered questions about their receptivity towards**
medication and counseling, taken from the Child and Adolescent Services Assessment
(CASA) [26], “Do you think that getting medications for a serious emotional or behavioral
problem would be (has been) a good idea for your child?” and “Do you think that getting
counseling for a serious emotional or behavioral problem would be (has been) a good idea
for your child?” Responses to each question occurred on a 4-point scale (0 = yes, definitely a
good idea; 1 = probably a good idea; 2 = probably not a good idea; 3 = definitely not a good
idea). Separate receptivity variables were created for medications and for counseling that
distinguished ‘receptive’ (treatment definitely/probably a good idea) from ‘unreceptive’
(treatment definitely/probably not a good idea) parents.


**Caregiver factors: Parents completed the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CSQ), a 21-item**
adult self-report instrument assessing the impact of caring for a child with emotional or
behavioral problems such as demands on time, financial strain, worry, guilt, and
embarrassment. Responses are scored on a 5-point scale from “not at all” to “very much” a
problem. The CSQ yields a global strain scale (lower score = less strain) and has satisfactory
psychometric performance [27]. Parents completed the Mental Health Inventory (MHI) [28],
a 5-item screener of psychological distress developed for use in general populations.
Questions like “How much of the time, during the last month, have you felt downhearted
and blue?” are scored on a 6-point scale (1 = All of the time, 6 = None of the time). The
MHI produces an overall score ranging from 5–30 (higher = better mental health) and has
shown satisfactory psychometric characteristics [28]. Parents also completed the Norbeck
Social Support Questionnaire (NSSQ) [29]. The NSSQ assesses parents’ network
characteristics, including network size, composition and perceived support. Two items
assess instrumental support received for parenting, like child care or transportation, on a 4point scale (0 = not at all; 4 = a great deal). Adequate psychometric performance has been
established, including test-retest reliability (.85–.92), internal consistency (.88–.96), and
concurrent validity [29,30].

**Adolescent perspectives**


**Clinical Need: Adolescents completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children Self**
Report of Personality (BASC-SRP). The 186-item BASC-SRP uses a true/false answer
format and yields an overall summary score of emotional and behavioral functioning, the
Emotional Symptom Index (ESI) [31]. The BASC-SRP has been used in diverse populations

and found to have adequate reliability and validity [31]. Like their parent, adolescents also
completed the CIS to assess their perceptions of functioning.

**Treatment receptivity: Like their parent, adolescents answered questions about their**
receptivity towards medication and counseling, taken from the Child and Adolescent
Services Assessment (CASA) [26], and with the identical 4-point response scale and scoring
to distinguish receptive from unreceptive respondents. The wording of the adolescents’
questions was “Do you think that getting medications for a serious emotional or behavioral
problem would be (has been) a good idea for you?” and “Do you think that getting
counseling for a serious emotional or behavioral problem would be (has been) a good idea
for you?”


**ADHD stigma: Adolescents also completed the ADHD Stigma Questionnaire (ASQ) to**
assess their stigma perceptions related to ADHD [32]. The 26-item ASQ assesses
perceptions of public stigma associated with ADHD, so participants are not be required to
reveal personal ADHD experiences. Adolescents respond to statements like “People with
ADHD work hard to keep it a secret” on a 4-point scale (1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree;
3 = agree; 4 = strongly agree). The measure yields an overall stigma score (range 1–4;
higher score = more perceived stigma). The ASQ has shown acceptable psychometric
properties in a diverse community sample of adolescents, including high internal
consistency (alpha = .93), good test-retest reliability (two-week intraclass correlation
coefficient =.71) and support for convergent and divergent validity [32].

**Outcomes**


**Mental Health Services Use: Receipt of mental health treatment services was assessed**
using the Child and Adolescent Services Assessment (CASA) [26], a parent-report measure
that inquires about mental health service use from 33 treatment settings including inpatient,
outpatient and informal care. If a mental health service was ever used, detailed information
about services use in the past twelve months, such as number of sessions, type of services,
and prescribed medication type, dose, and frequency, was gathered. Validity studies have
shown good to excellent agreement between CASA parent reports and medical records for
receiving outpatient services [33,34], and excellent agreement on details of the child’s
medication regimens [34]. Adolescents were identified as receiving mental health treatment
in the past 12 months if their parent reported any inpatient or outpatient mental health care
during 12 months prior to the interview date. To control for past treatment in the
multivariate analyses, the variable “prior treatment” was constructed using longitudinal data
from prior interview waves to identify adolescents who received any mental health services
more than 12 months prior to the interview date.


**Statistical analyses**

Agreement was examined using correlation for continuous data and kappa statistics for
binary data. Differences in adolescent demographics, parent perspectives (i.e., clinical need,
medication/counseling receptivity, psychological distress, caregiver strain, instrumental
support) and adolescent perspectives (i.e., clinical need, medication/counseling receptivity,
ADHD stigma) by past year mental health services use shown in Table 1 was examined
using chi-square test of proportions and Student T-tests. Effect sizes were calculated when
groups were significantly different, using Cohen’s d for continuous variables and odds ratios
for categorical variables. To model mental health service use in past year, shown in Table 2,
we fit a sequence of nested logistic regression models that included variables significantly
associated with service use in the bivariate analyses, organized into six potential predictor
domains (i.e., prior mental health treatment, parent report of adolescent need, parent attitude,
caregiver strain, adolescent perspectives of need, and adolescent attitudes).

-----

Sociodemographic characteristics were not included in the logistic modeling because they
were not associated with past year mental health service use in our bivariate analyses. We
tested the sequential nested models to investigate the hierarchical contribution of the
variable domains to predict past year mental health service use. For each model, significant
improvement in model fit was tested using goodness of fit analysis (i.e., computation of chisquare statistics based on differences of – 2 LOG L between models and the corresponding
difference of model degrees of freedom). Finally, shown in Table 3 we used a stepwise
logistic model to identify the variables that were most predictive of mental health service
use in the last 12 months.


### RESULTS

**Lifetime and past year mental health service use**


Most high-risk adolescents (n = 133, 79%) had received some mental health intervention
during their lifetime but less than one-half (n = 71, 42%) had used any mental health
services in the past 12 months (for details see Graph). Of the adolescents who had received
any mental health services in the past year, most (54/71, 76%) also had prior mental health
services. Use of inpatient services was rare (ever: n = 14, 8%; past year: n = 5, 3%), and of
the 14 adolescents with lifetime inpatient service use, most (n = 12, 86%) also had a history
of outpatient service use.


**Agreement between parent and adolescent perspectives**

Adolescent self reports of emotional adjustment (ESI scores) correlated moderately to
strongly with parents’ anxiety/depression ratings on the Vanderbilt (r=.48; p<.0001), but
were not related to parental reporting of symptoms of inattention (r=.06; p=.42),
hyperactivity/impulsivity (r=.05; p=.54), oppositional defiance (r=.11; p=.16) or conduct
problems (r=.15; p=.06). Parent and adolescent CIS scores were also moderately to strongly
related (r=.51; p<.0001). However, agreement between parent and adolescent receptivity to
the use of psychotropic medications (KAPPA = .09, p = .24) or counseling services
(KAPPA = −.02, p = .71) was poor.


**Bivariate relationship between parent and adolescent views and past year mental health**
**services use**

Past year mental health service use was related to several parent and adolescent perspectives
of clinical need and attitudes, and to caregiver strain, but not to sociodemographic
characteristics or public or private health insurance coverage. Of the parent perspectives,
higher ratings of inattention, anxiety/depression and functional impairment, but not of
hyperactivity/impulsivity, ODD or CD symptoms, were associated with obtaining mental
health treatment for their adolescent. Positive parent attitudes towards medication and higher
levels of caregiver strain were also related to past year mental health service use. Three
adolescent-reported perspectives, higher functional impairment, positive attitudes towards
medications and lower ADHD stigma perceptions, were associated with obtaining mental
health care in the past year. Further details about the comparisons, including estimates, pvalues and effect sizes, are shown in Table 1.


**Parent and adolescent perspectives as independent predictors of past year mental health**
**services use**

As shown in Table 2, parental perceptions of adolescent inattention symptoms and
medication receptivity were significant independent predictors of past year mental health
service use, as evidenced by statistically significant odds ratios and improved model fit after
the addition of each variable. Of the three adolescent perspectives, only the addition of

adolescent ADHD stigma perception resulted in further improvement of model fit in Model
6. Higher stigma perceptions significantly lowered the odds of mental health service use.

Stepwise regression confirmed the three predictors from the nested modeling (parental
inattention ratings, parent medication receptivity and adolescent ADHD stigma) and
identified adolescent-reported functioning as an additional predictor of past year mental
health use. As shown in Table 3 each unit increase of parental inattention and adolescentrated functional impairment raised the odds of service use by 1.2 and 1.1 respectively.
Having a medication-receptive parent raised the adolescent’s odds of mental health service
use by 3.8, whereas increases in ADHD stigma scores lowered the odds by a factor of five.


### DISCUSSION

Overall, findings from this study suggest that a substantial proportion of children at high risk
for ADHD drop out of care, and that adolescent perceived stigma about ADHD is
influential, above and beyond parent perspectives, in receiving mental health services in the
past year. Less than one-half of the cohort youth with ongoing ADHD treatment needs who
had ever received mental health services were still receiving them, consistent with other
studies reporting high rates of ADHD treatment discontinuation in adolescence [7,8]. Our
study suggests that mental health service receipt in the past year was associated with specific
parent- and adolescent-reported need (symptoms and functioning, respectively) and
attitudinal variables (medication receptivity and ADHD stigma, respectively), but not with
prior mental health treatment or with sociodemographic characteristics.

Study findings suggest that it is important to elicit both parent and adolescent perceptions of
clinical need during ADHD assessment and treatment planning. Parents and adolescents had
poor agreement on externalizing disorder symptoms, but were more aligned in their
perceptions of functional impairment. Interestingly, parental ratings of inattention, but not of
hyperactivity/impulsivity, ODD or CD were associated with mental health service use. This
finding may reflect the increasing importance of attentional capacities during adolescence,
when school assignment become more complex and inattentive ADHD symptoms result in
notable performance problems, a clear signal that help is needed. Conversely, behaviors
associated with ODD and CD may be interpreted to be typical adolescent misbehavior, a
developmental phenomenon that needs to be coped with, but that does not prompt a doctor
visit. Our study did not elicit parental explanatory models of adolescent behaviors, thus we
can only offer speculation about the underlying reasons for this interesting finding.

Of note, adolescents with ADHD in our study endorsed high rates of functional impairment,
even though their psychopathology self-reports were in the normative range. We
hypothesize that this discrepancy may be due to adolescents’ concern about stigma
associated with acknowledging ADHD symptoms, unlike reporting of functional problems.
We suggest that gathering adolescent-reported functioning may add valuable information on
clinical need during the ADHD assessment process and provide an opportunity to give voice
to adolescent perspectives.

Both parent and adolescent medication receptivity were related to service use, but exhibited
no agreement with each other. This was a surprising finding, as one might assume that
adolescents are influenced by family attitudes towards medication treatment. Limited
research exists on parent-child agreement for treatment receptivity. If confirmed in other
studies, our findings emphasize the importance of eliciting both parent and youth medication
attitudes during clinical encounters in order to enhance adolescents’ treatment engagement
and adherence.

-----

Adolescents’ perception of ADHD stigma emerged as a strong predictor of service use.
Stigma related to mental health problems may be particularly influential to service use for
teens, as respondents in a national child survey were more likely to make negative
attributions about peers with ADHD than peers with asthma, particularly with respect to the
likelihood of antisocial behavior and violence [20]. Because concerns about stigma may be
particularly pertinent for adolescents who are developmentally sensitive about others’
opinions and seek peer approval, their stigma perceptions may prevent help-seeking or
prompt treatment discontinuation.

Surprisingly, sociodemographic characteristics, including gender and race, which were
associated with service use in previous studies, did not show an association with treatment
receipt in adolescence. Conclusions however about the lack of health disparities cannot be
made because our sample size was relatively small, comparisons by race/ethnicity were
limited to African-American and Caucasian youth, and the study population was restricted to
one public school district population.

Interpretation of these findings should be considered within the context of several other
study limitations. External validity may have been limited by study attrition; those lost to
follow-up did not differ from participants by sociodemographic characteristics, but may
have differed on unmeasured constructs. Conclusions about a causal pathway between
adolescent perceptions of medication treatment receptivity and ADHD stigma are also
beyond the scope of this study’s design. To address these limitations, future studies
examining the extent adolescent perspectives moderate mental health service use should
include larger and more ethnically diverse community-based samples.


Despite these limitations, study findings suggest that adolescents exercise control over their
ADHD treatment, as their self-assessment of functioning and perceptions of ADHD stigma
are associated with mental health services use in the past year. Quality improvement
interventions for adolescents with ADHD should include developmentally sensitive
psychoeducational interventions that target medication treatment attitudes and stigma about
ADHD. Furthermore, pediatricians should consider monitoring adolescent-reported
functioning, along with parent-reported ADHD symptom ratings, to gauge treatment
response. In this manner pediatricians model shared decision-making for the family and
support adolescents’ transition to future independent medical encounters for ADHD care.
