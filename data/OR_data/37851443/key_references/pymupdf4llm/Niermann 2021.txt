_Background: Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders. While it is known that a majority_
of individuals with anxiety disorders remains untreated, actual treatment rates for adolescents and young adults
in Germany remain largely unknown.
_Methods: As part of the Behavior and Mind Health (BeMIND) study, examining a random community sample of_
14–21-year-olds (Dresden; Germany; N = 1,180), the lifetime prevalence for DSM-5 anxiety disorders and life­
time service utilization rates were determined by a standardized interview (DIA-X-5/CIDI).
_Results: In the present sample, 23.3 % of adolescents and young adults fulfilled DSM-5 criteria for at least one_
lifetime anxiety disorder. Of those, 39.1 % used any health care services, most frequently they visited an
outpatient psychotherapist/psychologist (23.0 %). Individuals with agoraphobia were most likely to use any inor outpatient specialized service (64.8 %), while individuals with a specific phobia were least likely (22.3 %).
Having a comorbid disorder or being female increased the likelihood of seeking help.
_Conclusion: The results showed that approximately 2/3 of adolescents and young adults suffering from an anxiety_
disorder did not seek help and only few report contacts with a psychotherapist. Given the adverse long-term
consequences of anxiety disorders, these findings suggest to improve efforts on increasing intervention aware­
ness and treatment possibilities for these individuals.


Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent and earliest devel­
oping mental disorders (Beesdo-Baum & Knappe, 2012; Jacobi et al.,
2004; Kessler, Ruscio, Shear, & Wittchen, 2010). They frequently take a
chronic and impairing course, co-occur with other mental disorders
(Beesdo-Baum et al., 2015; Kessler et al., 2010) and show increased
homotypic (i.e., a particular mental disorder predicts itself at a later time
point) and heterotypic (i.e., a particular mental disorder predicts
another disorder at a later time point) transitions of mental disorders
from childhood over adolescence to adulthood (Copeland et al., 2013).
Even though anxiety disorders can be effectively treated with


evidence-based therapies (Carpenter et al., 2018), the majority of in­
dividuals suffering from an anxiety disorder have been shown to remain
untreated (Heinig, Wittchen, & Knappe, 2021; Mack et al., 2014; Mer­
ikangas et al., 2011).
Rates of service utilization in adults with an anxiety disorder based
on DSM-IV criteria vary worldwide between 8 %–45 % based on 12months data of the World Mental Health Survey (Alonso et al., 2018).
Comparable results were found in other large scale studies in adult
population based on DSM-III and DSM-IV criteria (The Netherlands: Bijl
& Ravelli, 2000; Australia: Burgess et al., 2009; USA: Mackenzie, Rey­
nolds, Cairney, Streiner, & Sareen, 2012; Canada: Roberge, Fournier,
Duhoux, Nguyen, & Smolders, 2011). Regarding adults in Germany,

similar rates of service utilization when suffering from an DSM-IV based
anxiety disorder have been observed with a rate of 49 % for lifetime
(Mack et al., 2014) and 24 % for 12-months service utilization (Alonso
et al., 2018; Mack et al., 2014). Summarizing, more than half of all in­
dividuals with an anxiety disorder have never been in contact with any
mental health care service and even if professional service was used it
happened with a delay. In an adult sample, for example, it took on
average six years after the onset of an anxiety disorder before profes­
sional service was used (Mack et al., 2014).
Service utilization rates have also been suggested to vary according
to sex and comorbidity. Females with anxiety disorders report more
often the use of health care services than males (Burgess et al., 2009;
Kovess-Masfety et al., 2014; Mack et al., 2014; Merikangas et al., 2011;
Roberge et al., 2011; Runge, Beesdo, Lieb, & Wittchen, 2008). For
example Runge et al. (2008) found in a random community-based
sample of 14–34 year olds service utilization in 45 % of females and
27 % of males. Additionally, the co-occurrence of a mental disorder,
particularly comorbidity of a depressive disorder, increases the
perceived service need as well as the likelihood to seek help (Mack et al.,
2014; Meredith, Sherbourne, Jackson, Camp, & Wells, 1997; Mojtabai,
Olfson, & Mechanic, 2002; Scott, Mackenzie, Chipperfield, & Sareen,
2010).
Adolescents and young adults have high lifetime prevalence esti­
mates for any anxiety disorder (i.e. up to 31 %; Beesdo-Baum & Knappe,
2012; Merikangas et al., 2010). However, service utilization rates
among these younger age groups remains largely unknown. It has been
suggested that only one third or even fewer adolescents and young
adults with an DSM-IV based anxiety disorder seek help (rates between
18 % and 31 % ; Essau, 2005; Merikangas et al., 2011; Runge et al.,
2008), of which approximately only one third consult a psychotherapist
who can provide evidence-based treatment for an anxiety disorder


(Runge et al., 2008).
Beyond the results of previous studies mainly based on DSM-IV
criteria with a few exceptions (prevalence rates for anxiety disorders
based on DSM-5 criteria: Chen, Chen, Lin, Shen, & Gau, 2019; Wagner
et al., 2017), current data are necessary to identify the treatment gap
based on the new criteria for DSM-5 anxiety disorders (American Psy­
chiatric Association (APA), 2013). Here, separation anxiety disorder and
the specifier panic attack should be included (Wittchen, Heinig, &
Beesdo-Baum, 2014). The focus on adolescents and young adults is
essential because more than 50 % show the first onset of anxiety dis­
orders before the age of 14 (Kessler et al., 2005, 2007). Additionally, an
immediate treatment offer seems to be important to stop the homotypic
and heterotypic transition to adulthood (Copeland et al., 2013) as well
as the long-term negative functional outcomes of anxiety disorders
(Asselmann, Wittchen, Lieb, & Beesdo-Baum, 2018; Copeland, Wolke,
Shanahan, & Costello, 2015).
Therefore, the goal of the present descriptive epidemiological study
is to explore rates of service utilization in adolescents and young adults
with anxiety disorders to inform future approaches to reduce treatment
gaps. Specifically, the current study explores (1) lifetime prevalence
estimates for DSM-5 anxiety disorders and (2) lifetime and disorderspecific service utilization rates among adolescents and young adults
from a regional general population sample in Germany – a country with
free access to specialized treatment.

2015 to become part of the prospective-longitudinal Behavior and Mind
Health (BeMIND) study. The age span of 14–21 year-olds was chosen to
cover the core incidence phase for a range of mental disorders including
various anxiety disorders (Kessler et al., 2007). We divided the age span
at age 18, because it represents the legal age in Germany and decided
therefore to refer to the age group of 14–17 year-olds as adolescents and
the age group of 18–21 year-olds as young adults. Sampled individuals
who met the following criteria were eligible to participate: (i) living in a
household in Dresden during the time of testing, (ii) age 14–21, (iii)
sufficient German language skills, (iv) no institutionalization. Invitation
letters were sent by the study team to 6,321 individuals (in minors
addressed also to their legal guardians), with a maximum of two
reminder letters. 14.1 % of these individuals were not eligible, mostly
because they did not reside under the provided address. From the
remaining 5,428 individuals, 1,180 individuals completed the BeMIND
baseline assessment, resulting in a participation (response) rate of 21.7
%; the cooperation rate (i.e., ratio of all participants interviewed out of
all eligible participants ever contacted) was 43.4 % (American Associ­
ation for Public Opinion Research; AAPOR, 2016). The detailed
description of the BeMIND-study design, sampling, participant flow, and
baseline sample characteristics can be found elsewhere (Beesdo-Baum
et al., 2020). Written informed consent (for those aged 18 years or older)
or assent (for those younger than 18 years) was obtained after complete
study information. For minors, all legal guardians also provided written
informed consent. The study protocol was reviewed by the ethics com­
mittee of the Technische Universitat (TU) Dresden (EK381102014). ¨

_2.2. Measures_

_2.2.1. Diagnostic status_
Diagnostic status of the participants was determined using an
updated version of the Munich Composite International Diagnostic
Interview (DIA-X/M-CIDI; Wittchen & Pfister, 1997), a fully standard­
ized and computer-assisted personal interview for the assessment of a
wide range of mental disorders (DIA-X-5; Hoyer et al., 2020). It provides
reliable and valid information from age 14 onwards (Hoyer et al., 2020;


Wittchen, Lachner, Wunderlich, & Pfister, 1998). The DIA-X-5 assessed
both lifetime and 12-month diagnoses for anxiety and other mental
disorders according to the criteria of the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric
Association (APA), 2013). The interviews were conducted face-to-face
by trained clinical (psychology/medical) interviewers. Following a
section on demographic factors, each diagnostic section began with one
or several stem questions which were followed after positive endorse­
ment with further questions assessing all diagnostic criteria for the
respective diagnosis. Ages of onset and recency, persistence, impair­
ment, distress, and help seeking were also assessed. For the purpose of
the current study, the focus was on the following diagnoses of anxiety
disorders: panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety
disorder, agoraphobia, separation anxiety disorder, and specific phobia
(see Table 1). Test-Retest reliability (Cohens Kappa) for anxiety disor­
ders ranged between 0.29 for social anxiety disorder to 0.76 for specific
phobia. Comorbidities included other anxiety disorders, depressive
disorders comprising major depressive disorder and persistent depres­
sive disorder (dysthymia), as well as substance use disorders comprising
tobacco, alcohol, and illicit substance use disorders. Test-Retest reli­
ability (Cohens Kappa) was 0.81 for any depressive disorder and 0.75 for
any substance use disorder. For anxiety diagnoses, full DSM-5 diagnostic
criteria had to be met during the lifetime; for 12-month diagnoses, the
recency (last occurrence) had to be reported for the last 12 months. For a
12-month diagnosis of major depression and the substance use disor­
ders, it was assured that lifetime cases met the necessary number of
diagnostic symptoms also during the last 12 months. Co-occurring panic
attacks were considered as severity marker given that a panic-attack
specifier can be coded in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association
(APA), 2013).

_2.2.2. Service utilization_
_Any lifetime service utilization_ was assessed towards the end of the
DIA-X-5 interview (section Q), and with the help of corresponding lists
for institutions and providers. The module “service utilization” began
with the following question: “Have you ever visited/contacted any of the
_health care institutions (as listed in the respondent’s booklet) because of_

_mental health, psychosomatic, or substance use problems, either by yourself,_
_or by advise of others (medical doctors, relatives, partner)?”_ Positive
endorsement of this question was defined as “any lifetime service utili­
zation” and indicated broadly any contact to any health care services
because of mental health problems irrespective of type, frequency, and
adequacy of the possible treatment. In case participants endorsed this
entry question they were prompted to report all of the services that were
used/contacted at any point in their life. The type of sector/provider
that were assessed are listed in Table 3. Participants were also asked how
they were treated predominately: (i) with medication, (ii) with behav­
ioral therapy, (iii) with other psychotherapies, (iv) nothing of the pre­
vious. Multiple endorsements were possible.
Besides the lifetime service use questions in section Q, participants
entering the sections for the specific anxiety disorders, were asked
whether they had talked to a physician or another professional (e.g.,
psychologist, psychotherapist, social worker, counsellor, nurse, clergy,
chiropractor, naturopath) about their anxiety. A positive endorsement
was coded as _disorder-specific service utilization. Besides the lifetime_
service utilization rates of any help for mental health problems and the
disorder-specific service utilization rates, service utilization rates were
determined for _any in- or outpatient specialized service_ of any mental
health problems based on participant’s answers in the section Q. This
specialized service was determined based on service utilization of the
following combined type of sectors/providers: (i) outpatient health care
institutions: psychologist/psychotherapist, psychiatrist, psychiatric or
psychotherapeutic outpatient unit, and (ii) inpatient health care in­
stitutions: psychiatric, psychotherapeutic or psychosomatic inpatient
clinic/department.

_2.2.3. Socio-demographic variables_
The following socio-demographic variables were assessed: sex, age,
nationality, and education status. Education status was assessed by
asking participants first, whether they were still visiting school and if yes
which type of school. Those who already finished school were asked
about their degree of final education. Additionally, the current living
situation, marital and work status were assessed. Perceived social class
was assessed by asking one item: ‘Which social class would you say you
belong to?’ rated on a 6-point Likert-scale from 1=lower class to
6=upper class. Further information can be found in Beesdo-Baum et al.
(2020).

_2.3. Analysis_

Statistical analyses regarding the prevalence estimates for anxiety
disorders are based on the 1,180 baseline participants. Participants with
missing information in diagnostic sections of the DIA-X-5 were counted
as non-cases (4/1180 participants completed only part of the anxiety
disorder section). For analyses on service utilization, only cases
providing data in the Q-section were used (see results for more


information). Data were calculated using weights to improve represen­
tativeness of the sample (Beesdo-Baum et al., 2020); percentages are
reported weighted, but numbers are reported unweighted. Differences in
prevalence and service utilization rates by age, sex, and comorbidity
were tested with odds ratios (ORs) from logistic regressions with 95 %
confidence intervals. Analyses were conducted in the statistical, data
analysis software STATA (15.0 StataCorp, 2017).

**3. Results**

_3.1. Sample characteristics_

The mean age of the total sample (N = 1,180) was 17.3 years (SD =
2.3) and was similar for 495 male (51.7 %, 17.1, SD = 2.3) and 685
female participants (48.3 %, 17.4, SD = 2.2). Most participants had a
German Nationality (N = 1,150; 97.1 %), received a high education (i.e.
completed or still visited a high school/”A”-level secondary education, N
= 882, 76.5 %), and rated themselves to be part of the middle social class
(N = 710, 60.6 %). Among participants, 48.7 % (N = 722) still went to
school, 28.6 % (N = 231) were university students, 10.0 % (N=99) were
in a job training, 6.9 % (N=61) employed, 65.1 % (N = 881) lived with a
parent, and 99.2 % (N = 1,172) had never been married. For a detailed
description of the BeMIND-study sample characteristics, see Beesdo-­
Baum et al. (2020).

_3.2. Prevalence of anxiety disorders_

Within the sample, 23.3 % of adolescents and young adults fulfilled
the lifetime criteria for at least one anxiety disorder according to DSM-5.
The 12-month prevalence was 16.5 %. The diagnosis of any specific
phobia was most frequent, followed by social anxiety disorder (Table 1).
The least common anxiety diagnosis was agoraphobia for lifetime and
separation anxiety disorder for the past 12 months. Females suffered
twice as frequently from any lifetime or past 12-months anxiety disorder
compared to males (lifetime: OR = 2.16, 95 % CI [1.59, 2.95], p < .001;
past 12-months: OR = 2.87, 95 % CI [1.97, 4.18], p < .001), and 18− 21
year-olds were 1.5 times more likely to suffer from any lifetime or past
12-months anxiety disorder compared to 14− 17 year-olds (OR = 1.58,
95 % CI [1.19, 2.10], p = .001; past 12-months: OR = 1.53, 95 % CI

[1.12, 2.10], p = .008).
Most individuals suffering from an anxiety disorder (71.5 %) fulfilled
the lifetime diagnostic criteria for only one anxiety disorder, whereas
21.0 % had one comorbid anxiety disorder and 7.4 % had two or more
comorbid anxiety disorders. Out of the individuals with an anxiety
disorder, 35.2 % suffered also from a lifetime depressive disorder, 37.4
% from a lifetime substance use disorder, and 36.0 % from lifetime panic
attacks. Comorbid lifetime depressive disorder was more frequently
reported by females compared to males (OR = 2.15, 95 % CI [1.13,
4.09], _p_ = .020), and 18− 21 year-olds revealed more frequently a

_3.3. Service utilization_

Two of the 279 participants diagnosed with an anxiety disorder did
not provide any information regarding service use in the Q-section.
Therefore, the statistical analyses regarding service utilization rates
(based on the Q-section) among individuals diagnosed with an anxiety
disorder were based on 277 individuals. For service utilization rates of
disorder-specific consultations of a physician or other professional, data
were available of all 279 participants diagnosed with an anxiety disor­
der, except for specific phobia. Two participants diagnosed with a spe­
cific phobia from the Blood-Injection-Injury Subtype did not provide any
information about disorder-specific consultation of physician or other
professional.
Among the sample of 277 adolescents and young adults reporting a
lifetime anxiety disorder, 39.1 % made use of any lifetime health care
services for mental health problems. No sex (OR = 1.36, 95 % CI [0.76,
2.46], p = .302) or age (OR = 1.45, 95 % CI [0.87, 2.43], p = .155)


differences emerged. Any lifetime health care utilization was highest
among individuals with agoraphobia (85.5 %) and lowest for specific
phobia (33.0 %). Out of the individuals with any anxiety disorder, 42.9
% reported at least one disorder-specific consultation of a physician or
another professional, which was also highest for agoraphobia (73.1 %)
and lowest for specific phobia (21.0 %) (Table 2).
Among cases with a lifetime anxiety disorder, outpatient mental
health care institutions were visited most frequently (31.5 %; Table 3).
Lifetime rates for inpatient service use and for the complementary sector
were 11.2 % and 10.7 %, respectively. The 18− 21 year-olds were 1.7
times more likely to visit outpatient mental health care institutions
compared to 14− 17 year-olds (OR = 1.79, 95 % CI [1.03, 3.09], p =
.038), while no sex differences (OR = 1.71, 95 % CI [0.90, 3.25], p =
.102) emerged. No sex or age differences were observed for use of the
inpatient (sex: OR = 0.78, 95 % CI [0.33, 1.87], p = .581, age: OR =
0.81, 95 % CI [0.37, 1.78], p = .600) and the complementary sector (sex:
OR = 1.03, 95 % CI [0.40, 2.63], p = .957, age: OR = 1.14, 95 % CI

[0.50, 2.59], p = .755). A differentiation of health care utilization ac­
cording to the type of outpatient sector or provider showed that in­
dividuals with a lifetime anxiety disorder consulted most often a

psychotherapist/psychologist (23.0 %). A trend but no significant effect
for sex was found (female vs. male: OR = 2.02, 95 % CI [0.97, 4.20], p =
.062). No age differences (OR = 1.65, 95 % CI [0.91, 3.00], p = .101)
emerged. When considering any in- or outpatient specialized service for
any anxiety disorder (Table 4), a similar pattern emerged: females made
nearly twice as often use of any in- or outpatient specialized service
compared to males (OR = 1.95, 95 % CI [1.01, 3.73], p = .045). Also, a
trend but no significant difference was observed for higher age (18− 21
vs. 14− 17 years: OR = 1.60, 95 % CI [0.93, 2.76], p = .090). Particu­
larly, individuals with agoraphobia were most likely to consult any in- or
outpatient specialized service (64.8 %; Table 4), whereas individuals
with a lifetime specific phobia were least likely to consult any in- or
outpatient specialized service (22.3 %).
Among individuals with a lifetime anxiety disorder who sought any
help (N = 104), 46.7 % (N = 49; 95 % CI [36.6, 57.2]) indicated to be
treated predominately with behavioral therapy and 29.5 % (N = 32; 95
% CI [20.9, 39.7]) with other forms of psychotherapy. 19.9 % (N = 19;
95 % CI [12.6, 30.0]) reported to be treated predominantly with
medication of which 17.7 % (N = 17; 95 % CI [10.8, 27.6]) were also
treated with behavioral or any other psychotherapy. None of the pre­
vious was reported by 30.0 % (N = 29; 95 % CI [21.1, 40.6]). One in­
dividual with any lifetime anxiety disorder who sought help, did not
provide information about the content of treatment.
The occurrence of comorbid mental disorders among individuals
with a lifetime anxiety disorder was associated with service use
(Table 5). Lifetime service use rates for any mental health problems were
higher among individuals with two or more comorbid anxiety disorders
(OR = 3.23, 95 % CI [1.23, 8.45], p = .017), with a comorbid depressive
disorder (OR = 2.04, 95 % CI [1.18, 3.51], p = .011), with combined
comorbid depressive and substance use disorders (OR = 2.43, 95 % CI

[1.10, 5.35], p = .027), as well as among individuals with co-occurring
panic attacks (OR = 1.81, 95 % CI [1.05, 3.10], p = .032), compared to
individuals without a comorbidity/co-occurrence. No differences in any
lifetime service use rates were found when just considering comorbid
substance use disorders individually (OR = 1.45, 95 % CI [0.83, 2.51], p
= .188). Additionally, individuals with two or more comorbid anxiety
disorders (OR = 3.69, 95 % CI [1.42, 9.58], _p_ = .007), comorbid
depressive disorder (OR = 2.88, 95 % CI [1.63, 5.09], p < .001), sub­
stance use disorders (OR = 2.13, 95 % CI [1.20, 3.76], _p_ = .010)
compared to individuals without a comorbidity, or combined comorbid
depressive and substance use disorders (OR = 4.85, 95 % CI [2.12,
11.08], p < .001) compared to individuals without a multi-comorbidity,
reported more consultations with any in- or outpatient specialized ser­
vice. Individuals with co-occurring panic attacks showed, however, no
differences in their consultations of any in- or outpatient specialized
services compared to individuals without co-occurring panic attacks (OR
= 1.55, 95 % CI [0.88, 2.72], p = .129).

**4. Discussion**

The aim of this study was to present prevalence and lifetime as well
as disorder-specific service utilization rates for anxiety disorders based
on the DSM-5 criteria. Using data from a regional general population
sample of adolescents and young adults in Dresden, Germany, a preva­
lence estimate of 23.3 % for lifetime and 16.5 % for the past 12-months
was found. The results further suggest that only approximately 1/3 of
both adolescents and young adults with a lifetime anxiety disorder used
a health care services for any mental health problem during their life,
most often consulting an outpatient psychotherapist/psychologist. In­
dividuals with agoraphobia were most likely to seek help, while in­
dividuals with specific phobia were least likely. In line with previous
research (Mack et al., 2014; Meredith et al., 1997; Mojtabai et al., 2002;
Scott et al., 2010), comorbidity increased the likelihood to use mental
health care services. In addition and again consistent with previous
research (Burgess et al., 2009; Mack et al., 2014; Merikangas et al.,
2011; Roberge et al., 2011; Runge et al., 2008), females were somewhat


more likely to seek help compared to males.
Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders.
However, actual lifetime and 12-month prevalence rates of anxiety
disorders based on diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5 are lacking so far –
including in Germany. The observed prevalence of 23.3 % for lifetime
and 16.5 % for the past 12 months, therefore, provides a first estimate of
the occurrence of DSM-5 based anxiety disorders among German ado­
lescents and young adults. The findings are slightly higher as compared
to previously reported DSM-5 based anxiety disorder lifetime (15.6 %)
and point (10.2 %) prevalence estimates in a representative populationbased Austrian sample of adolescents (Wagner et al., 2017), though
estimates overall confirm the high prevalence of anxiety disorders
(Beesdo-Baum & Knappe, 2012; Jacobi et al., 2004; Kessler et al., 2010;
Polanczyk, Salum, Sugaya, Caye, & Rohde, 2015). In addition, the
DSM-5 specifier panic attack was endorsed by 36 %. Despite this high
prevalence and the effective, evidence-based treatment possibilities for
anxiety disorders (Carpenter et al., 2018), it is concerning that only
about 1/3 of young individuals fulfilling the criteria for an anxiety
disorder use any mental health care services. This low service utilization
rate was confirmed by other studies both internationally (Bijl & Ravelli,
2000; Burgess et al., 2009; Mackenzie et al., 2012; Merikangas et al.,
2011; Roberge et al., 2011) and locally in Germany (Essau, 2005; Mack
et al., 2014; Runge et al., 2008). It is in sharp contrast to the possibility
to directly and freely access mental health care providers in highly
developed mental health care systems such as Germany. Particularly,
individuals with a specific phobia were least likely to seek help. Phobic
disorders therefore seem to be both the most prevalent but also the least
treated anxiety disorders, despite the availability of highly efficient and
effective treatments (Zlomke and Davis, 2008).
Comorbidity and particularly multi-comorbidity increased the like­
lihood of seeking help. This may be due to the overall higher burden and
impairment associated with comorbidities (de Lijster et al., 2018;
Walker & Druss, 2017), and therefore greater recognition - by affected
individuals themselves, by friends/relatives, or by health professionals that they need help. Though, poorer treatment outcomes were found in
those with comorbid disorders (Walczak, Ollendick, Ryan, & Esbjørn,
2018) which points to the need of strategies to foster earlier
help-seeking, recognition, and treatment.
When directly comparing any service utilization rates reported in our
study (age 14− 17 years: 33.2 % vs. age 18− 21 years: 41.9 %) to any
service utilization rates reported within the Early Developmental Stages
of Psychopathology (EDSP) study (age _< 20 years: 30.6 %w vs. age_
20–24 years: 33.2 %w) conducted more than 10 years ago in Germany
using the same diagnostic instrument though based on DSM-IV criteria, a
trend could be observed towards increased mental health care utiliza­
tion rates for young individuals with an anxiety disorder in Germany. In
our sample, 18− 21 year-olds were somewhat more likely to consult
mental health care services compared to 14− 17 year-olds. Despite the
likely increased treatment awareness within the last years, particularly
for young adults, anxiety disorders still remain largely untreated. This is
particularly alarming because most young individuals with an anxiety
disorder will suffer from the same or other mental disorders later on
during their life (Beesdo, Knappe, & Pine, 2009; Copeland et al., 2013).
Anxiety disorders can, therefore, be seen as an important modifiable risk
factor for a developmental cascade of future psychopathology (Raballo
& Poletti, 2020), highlighting the need for early prevention approaches
(Arango et al., 2018), early detection in prodromal phases and increased
adequate treatment offers (Holmes et al., 2018).
The results of the present study emphasize that the treatment gap is
still large. It also points to the need of tailored early intervention stra­
tegies, to increase adequate treatment particularly in (i) individuals with
specific phobia due to the long-term negative health outcomes (Albor,
Benjet, M´endez, & Medina-Mora, 2017), (ii) boys, particularly those
with social anxiety disorder, (iii) individuals with comorbid disorders,
and (iv) the age group 14− 17 years to provide immediate health care.

_4.1. Limitations_

A few interpretational issues should be discussed. First, both symp­
toms of mental disorders and service use were assessed with partici­
pant’s self-reports, which may be influenced by participant’s perception
and recall. Therefore, potential errors made by participants cannot be
excluded, especially when designating types of services and providers.
In particular, in Germany “psychiatrists” are often labeled and qualified
as specialist for psychiatry and psychotherapy. As a result, participants
may have had difficulties in distinguishing between psychotherapy and
psychiatry (Mack et al., 2014). Second, we present mainly data of health
care service use because of any mental health problem, irrespective of
type, frequency, or adequacy of the received treatment, as well as irre­
spective of a specific tailor to an individual’s anxiety disorder. However,
in the present study similar service utilization rates were found for any
mental health problem and for disorder-specific consultations (Table 2),
suggesting that reports of service use due to any mental health problems
in section Q of the DIA-X-5 interview likely reflect largely the
disorder-specific consultations. Third, the participation rate was overall
low and based on a regional sample which might limit the generaliz­
ability of the findings. A detailed discussion of possible reasons for the
low participation can be found elsewhere (Beesdo-Baum et al., 2020).
Though one key difference to a regional study in Germany with response
rates above 70 % more than 15 years ago (Beesdo-Baum et al., 2015) was
the limited use of standard epidemiological procedures such as home
visits or telephone contacts for recruitment due to legal regulations. Yet,
low participation is common in recent years especially in adolescent
samples (Keeble, Baxter, Barber, & Law, 2016) and not necessarily
reflective of selection bias (Morton, Bandara, Robinson, & Atatoa-Carr,
2012). In addition, the low number of individuals within each anxiety
group has limited the possibility to statistically investigate sex and age
differences within each anxiety disorder. However, descriptive infor­
mation — separately presented for sex and age groups (see Tables 1–5)
— gives first directions for future research into this matter. Fourth, no
barriers were assessed that may prevent adolescents and young adults
diagnosed with an anxiety disorders from seeking help. Future research
should focus more closely on the assessment of treatment barriers as well
as on online help-seeking behavior, which may become more relevant
within this participant sample. Increased insights into factors influ­
encing who seeks treatment and who not will help to improve recogni­
tion and tailor intervention efforts to improve mental health.

_4.2. Conclusions_

Overall, the present results suggest that anxiety disorders are com­
mon mental disorders and that only about 1/3 of adolescents and young
adults with an anxiety disorder seek treatment, most often consulting an
outpatient psychotherapist/psychologist. Given this low health care
service utilization rate as well as the potential adverse long-term con­
sequences associated with anxiety disorders, these findings highlight the
need to improve recognition and intervention efforts for individuals
suffering from an anxiety disorder.
