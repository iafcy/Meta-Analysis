The adolescents participating were selected for interviews by the research team in the order that they
presented to the clinics for care. The adolescents
understood that these interviews were totally independent of their health care. Whenever possible,
interviews were completed on site immediately before or after a clinic visit. Otherwise, an appointment
for a future interview was arranged. Postponed interviews were usually completed within a few days

The modified version of the DIS used for our study
allows lifetime and current diagnoses of major
depression, dysthymia, and drug and/or alcohol
abuse and dependence. The DIS depression section
also provides information about swicide ideation and

frequent thoughts of death, 2 weeks or more of
wanting to die, thiig of committing suicide, or
a history of attempting suicide.
The diagnosis of conduct disorder is based on
questions from the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents (DICA). The DICA is a structured interview protocol designed to diagnose

association between depression and suicide, the
overlap is far from complete. Many depressed adolescents are not suicidal, and some, suicidal adolescents do not have symptoms of depression. Of

Conducr L&r&r. Eleven percent of the patients
met criteria for a DSM-ILI diagnosis of a conduct
disorder within the last year. Nevertheless, only
26% of those conduct-disordered youths sought or
received help for their behavior problems. Thus, less
than one in three of the patients displaying behaviors directly related to high community rates of morbidity and mortality received an intervention for
those behaviors.

_or Dependency._
Substance Abuse Much of the morbidity and mortality in inner-city communities
may be associated with high rates of alcohol or
drug abuse and dependence. Although there was
a heavy use of alcohol and drugs (Table 2) in our
population, the number of patients with alcohol
or drug abuse or dependence (by DSM-III diagnostic criteria) tias too low for separate analyses.
The overlap was considerable. Only 61 youths
had a diagnosis of alcohol abuti or dependence,
and only 11 had a diagnosis of substance abuse or
dependence. Therefore, the youths with a diagnosis of alcdhol abuse/dependence and illicit drug
abuse/dependence were combined. Six percent of
the patients had substance abuse behavior in the
year, but only one in five sought or received help
for their substana: &use.

The problems that we have singled out for discussion are important because they put youth at a high
risk for death. Depression and suicide ideas increase
the risk for suicide; conduct disorder and substance


abuse increase the risk for homicide and accidental
death. These causes claim many more lives of
**yomgsters** than do physical illness or unwanted
pregnancy. It seems clear that the health clinics have
the opportunity to provide help for these problems
because the frequency is high among theu patients.
However, our findings suggest that high-risk adolescents typically do not seek help for these prob**lems.**
The highest rate of help seeking occurred for
the physical care needs of sexually active females,
as securing a contraceptive, but even then it
ot exceed `tie` thirds. Thus, even in the current
national climate in which considerable attention is
being given to the prevention of adolescent pregnancy, a substantial number of sexually active girls
who are in contact with a medical clinic are not asking for or being offered contraceptive help. Although considerable variation in help seeking for the
other four mental health conditions was found, in
each case less ?han half of those identified by the
interview as having a high-risk condition sought or
received help. The rates of care for suicide ideation,
conduct disorder, and substance abuse were particularly low, with less than a third of those youths
identified by the research interview as having the
problem seeking or receiving help.
These less than satisfactory rates of help seeking
are important, given that the sample youths had
already elected to visit a clinic for some type of help,
and at least some of them had had multiple clinic
contacts. This finding suggests that, during intake
procedures with adolescents, clinic staff may need
to increase the amount of probing or questioning,
particularly in the area of mental health problems,
which adolescents tend to perceive as inappropriate
oroblems to discuss with health care professionals
m this setting. It can be reasonably assumed that
nonpatients, or nonclinic attenders, may have even
lower rates of help seeking. The relatively low proportion of help seekers suggests that much work is
still needed in the arta of outreach to youths not
using health services, as well as to youths who are
using health clinics but are not seeking care for the
types of conditions we examined. The predominance of females at our clinics further illustrates that
a major problem exists in attracting at-risk males.
