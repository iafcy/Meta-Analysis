 Background: To date, no one-phase survey of childhood depression has been per- formed in China that involves both urban and rural community children. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence, correlates, and mental health service utilization of depressive disorders (DDs) in a community-based sample of 6–14-year-old children in south-central China. Methods: Children (3,582) were approached through multistage sampling and interviewed using a Chinese version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Chil- dren and Adolescents 5.0, which is a structured interview that is administered by trained psychiatrists to obtain information from children and their guardians. Results: The overall prevalence of all current DDs was found to be 2.8% (95%CI: 1.5–3.9). The risk factors for depression included being 9–14-year old, not at- tending school, having unmarried parents, living in a nonnuclear family (single parent or parentless family), being taken care of by people other than two par- ents (single parent, grandparent(s), other relatives, or others) during the past year, and not being breastfed prior to 1 year of age. Only 5.8% of the depressed children had received professional help prior to the interview. Conclusions: The prevalence of DDs among children in this part of China is relatively high com- pared with most figures reported in other countries. Depression in this age group has been a major public health concern, but it is often underrecognized. There is

#### INTRODUCTION
## Depression is currently the second leading cause of
###### disability, and it is predicted that it will be the highest medically related cause of death and disability worldwide by 2030.[[1]] Several studies have revealed that depres- sive symptoms are among the most common psychiatric health complaints in children and adolescents in China[[2]] and western countries.[[3]] The presence of depression in childhood significantly increases the risk of comor- bid psychiatric illnesses[[4]] and physical disorders.[[5]] Fur- thermore, both retrospective and prospective studies have shown that the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statis- tical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) di- agnoses of anxiety, mood, and multiple substance use disorders in adulthood are significantly predicted by childhood depression.[[6–8]] Depression negatively im- pacts children’s growth and development, school per- formance, and peer or family relationships, and it may lead to suicide.[[9]] The negative ways in which children are affected by depression highlight the importance of gaining an understanding of the magnitude, risk factors, and mental health service utilization of depressive dis- orders (DDs) in children and adolescents. However, in contrast to the numerous epidemiological studies of DDs in adults, the epidemiology of DDs in children has re- ceived less research attention, especially in China.
 Although epidemiological estimates on the preva- lence rates of DDs vary depending on the investiga- tion method, informant report, standardized assessment measure, and diagnostic criteria used,[[10]] results from prevalence studies indicate that childhood DDs are not rare.[[11]] Dysthymic disorder (DYD) has a current preva- lence of 0.6–1.7% in prepubertal children and 1.6–8% in adolescents.[[12]] The past-year prevalence rates from previous studies showed a median prevalence estimate of 4.0%, with a range of 0.1–8% for major depressive disorder (MDD).[[13–15]] Costello et al. performed a meta- analysis of 26 studies and found that the current preva- lence rates of DDs were 2.8% for children under 13 years of age and 5.6% for 14–18-year-old.[[16]] In terms of lifetime prevalence, rates as high as 25% by the end of adolescence have been reported.[[4]]
 It is thought that socio-cultural factors play an im- portant role in the occurrence of mental disorders. To- day, Chinese children and adolescents are facing more tremendous socioeconomic transformations than their predecessors. Due to the competitive education sys- tem and high parental expectations of academic perfor- mance, Chinese students are suffering from high levels of academic stress associated with high school and uni

###### versity entrance examinations.[[17,18]] Shifting socioeco- nomic structures have also led to profound changes in the organization of family life. In rural China, due to urbanization, an enormous number of rural laborers are continually migrating to cities in search of better job opportunities. Among these laborers, most of the young parents have to leave their children behind for financial reasons. Thus, millions of children are remained in the rural communities and taken care of by single parents, grandparents, other relatives, or themselves.[[19]] Liu et al. found that the children who were left at home and sep- arated from their parents at a younger age had more depressive symptoms.[[19]] It is expected that the preva- lence of DDs would increase in the context of China’s urbanization.
 Sample selection is one of the most important factors affecting prevalence. Two-phase studies in schoolchil- dren, which have the advantages of good sampling effi- ciency and low cost, are very popular in prevalence es- timation of child and adolescent mental disorders.[[20]] These studies[[21–34]] firstly screened a large sample of schoolchildren with a short depression screening scale and then selected a subsample for a more in-depth stan- dardized diagnostic interview. While it should be noted that these school-based surveys could potentially lead to a selection bias,[[35]] as those have mental disorders, i.e. schizophrenia and MDD, are more likely to discontinue their schooling, thus could not be sampled.[[36,37]] Child- hood depression surveys in communities[[38–42]] showed relatively higher prevalence rates than surveys in schools (community children: range = 0.0–4.9%, median = 1.4%, mean = 1.7%; school children: range = 0.0–4.8%, median = 1.2%, mean = 1.3%). As a consequence, exist- ing school-based studies might underestimate the preva- lence of DDs in children. Along with the representa- tiveness of the sample, these two-phase studies have also been criticized for a loss of precision in the prevalence estimation.[[43]] To the best of our knowledge, only 4 two- phase studies[[23–26]] that both use stringent methods and are published in local journals have assessed the preva- lence of childhood depression in urban schoolchildren of mainland China. A well-designed study of the preva- lence of childhood DDs in a representative community- dwelling sample in China is lacking.
 The current study was carried out to (1) provide preva- lence estimates of DDs among children living in urban and rural communities of Wuhan, China; (2) identify risk factors of childhood DDs; and (3) investigate the mental health service use of children with DDs. This study was part of a large-scale epidemiological survey

###### of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the popula- tion aged ≥6 years in Wuhan, China. Because subjects aged ≥15 years were categorized into the adult sample and interviewed using an adult mental disorder assess- ment tool, the present study only reported the results of children aged 6–14 years.

##### METHODS

###### SETTING

This survey was conducted in Wuhan, which is a large metropolitan
city in south-central China and is the capital of Hubei province. It has
a population of approximately 10,020,000 people, and approximately
63.1 and 36.9% residents live in its urban and rural areas, respectively.
Like other major cities in China, it is characterized by rapid economic
growth and urbanization, with the portion of the urban population
growing from 38.1% in 1980 to 65.6% in 2010.[[44]] For several years,
it has been ranked number 12 in the top 50 cities of China for comprehensive economic strength. According to the official reports, it is
also one of the major migrant labor exporting regions in China.[[45]]

###### SUBJECTS AND SAMPLING

Based on previous studies,[[16,24–26]] we presumed the prevalence
rate of DD was 0.025, with a precision of 0.011, a response rate of
0.85, a confidence interval of 95% (95%CI), and a design effect of 1.2.
PASS 2008 (LLC, Kaysville, UT, USA) estimated the sample size to
be approximately 4,500. In this study, eligible subjects are defined as
follows: (1) community children who were 6–14-year old; (2) children
whose parents or guardians agreed to participate; and (3) children who
had been living in Wuhan for at least 6 months by November 15,
2009, irrespective of their household registration status (local permanent resident or nonlocal resident). Children were excluded if any of
the following criteria were met: (1) no parent or guardian could give
informed consent; (2) disabilities due to deafness and aphasia; (3) severe
physical illness that obstructs communication; or (4) obvious intellectual disorder.

We adopted a multistage, stratified cluster, random sampling
method to obtain a representative sample of children. In stages 1 and
2 of sampling, the 13 districts in Wuhan were divided into two strata
(urban versus rural) on the basis of economic conditions, and then 16
subdistricts in urban strata and nine townships in rural strata were randomly selected, respectively. Twenty-eight urban communities from
identified subdistricts and 18 rural communities from identified townships were randomly selected proportional to size in stage 3. In the
fourth stage, 80–120 households in each identified community were
randomly selected. One child was randomly selected from those who
were 6–14-year old in each selected household in the final sampling
stage. A flow-chart describing the sampling details and participation
rates is depicted in Fig. 1.

###### INSTRUMENTS AND MEASURES

DSM-IV DDs were assessed using the Chinese version of the Mini
International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID) 5.0,[[46,47]] with parallel child/adolescent (MINIKID-C) and parent (MINI-KID-P) interview versions. The MINIKID is a structured clinical diagnostic interview designed to assess
the presence of DSM-IV mental disorders in children and adolescents
aged 6–17 years. Both Chinese versions of the MINI-KID have been
proven to be reliable and valid for mental disorders in Chinese children and adolescents.[[46,47]] In our survey, DD was considered to be
present when either the parent or child version of MINI-KID met the
full DSM-IV DD diagnostic criteria.


###### f p

To diagnose minor depressive disorder (MIDD, one type of depressive disorder not otherwise specified), we changed the skip rule of
MINI-KID MDD module. Our interviewers were asked to continue
to inquire about the clinical significance of depressive symptoms if the
respondents presented with more than one depressive symptom item
instead of the original rule, which requires at least five symptom items.
This survey included MDD, DYD, and MIDD for establishing DD diagnoses based on a 1-month time frame, and thus provided the current
prevalence rates of DDs.

In addition, each subject was given a questionnaire that inquired
about the respondent’s age, gender, education year, marital status of
his/her parents, family type, local residency status, mode of delivery,
breastfeeding status, relationship of family members, parenting style,
caregiver, and other socio-economic variables. In regards to the mental
health service utilization, depressed respondents were asked if they
had sought help or treatment for their emotional problems in their
lifetime and what types of service they had received. According to the
providers of mental health services, the care-seeking behaviors were
classified into three categories: never sought help, saw a mental health
professional (e.g. psychiatrists, psychologists, or licensed psychological
consultants/counselors), or only saw a nonmental health professional
(e.g. nonpsychiatric physicians/pediatricians, nurses, herbalists, witch
doctors, or religious specialists).

###### PROCEDURES

The survey was performed from November 2009 through June
2010. Before respondents and their guardians were interviewed, a written informed consent was obtained from their guardians, and declarationsofanonymityandconfidentialityweremade.TheResearchEthics
Committee of Wuhan Mental Health Center approved this protocol.
Professional treatment suggestions were also provided to the guardians
of participants with diagnosed mental disorder.

Face-to-face interviews occurred in the subject’s home. Two interviewers were assigned to each household to complete interviews
separately (one administered the MINI-KID-C, the other one administered the MINI-KID-P), for the purpose of reducing interference
with the respondent’s family life. Children younger than 13 years were
administered the MINI-KID-C interview along with their guardians.
Questions were directed to the children, but the parents were encouraged to interject if they felt that the children’s answers were unclear
or inaccurate. For children aged 13 and 14 years, the MINI-KID-C
was administered without a parent present. The MINI-KID-P was administered to the guardian of the subject. The interviewer made the
final decision using his/her best clinical judgment regarding whether
a participant’s answers met the diagnostic criteria for the questions.

###### QUALITY CONTROL

The interviews were administered by 18 trained psychiatrists who
were selected from eight psychiatric hospitals in Hubei Province and
had at least 2 years of clinical experience. The psychiatrists underwent
a 56-hr training program that included an overview of the MINI-KID,
a detailed explanation on the use of the MINI-KID, role play, mock
interviews, interview techniques, patient interviews, and survey procedures. The training program was closely monitored and supervised by
two senior child psychiatrists. At the end of the program, all the interviewers attended an inter-rater reliability test involving six outpatients
with childhood depression, two bipolar adolescents, four schizophrenia children, four pupils, and three middle-school students. The kappa
values between interviewers were very good (0.84 for the MINI-KIDC and 0.82 for the MINI-KID-P).

To guarantee the representativeness of our community sample, we
used the Family Policy Register System of the respective community
to select the households with at least one child in the eligible age

range. The Family Policy Register System belongs to “One-ChildPer-Family Policy,” which is a mandatory national policy to control
the Chinese population. This system has the most comprehensive and
up-to-date registration rate of community households with children
and adolescents.

Prior to the survey, a pilot study of 423 households was conducted in
one urban community and one rural community, and 24 depressed subjects were identified through the MINI-KID interviews. Two senior
child psychiatrists reassessed these depressed children and 18 normal
children with DSM-IV criteria in a double-blind style and found that
the agreement coefficient was excellent (kappa = 0.94).

During the survey period, the team leader randomly selected 5%
of the respondents and assigned two blinded psychiatrists to reassess
them with the MINI-KID independently. One hundred and fortyseven children completed the reassessment, and the kappa value for
any DD was 0.93. The concordance of the MINI-KID-P with the
MINI-KID-C was found to be 0.85.

All the interviewers were required to submit the interview records
on each working day. The data check on the completeness and logicality was completed before the interviewer’s submission. Errors and
other flaws were solved at the scene.

###### STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Respondents who completed either version of the MINI-KID were
weighted up to project to the original sample size and were corrected
with nonresponse rates by age, sex, and region. We used the Complex
Survey module in SPSS 17.0 for Windows to estimate the prevalence
of DDs and the respective CIs. We examined associations of any DD
with age, gender, and region using χ [2] and χ [2] for trend. The multivariate logistic regression model within the Complex Survey module was
used to identify factors associated with depression. Associations between depression and all potential predictors were assessed in univariate analyses, followed by multivariate analyses of the selected subsets.
A variable was selected if it was statistically significant at the nominal
two-sided 0.05 level in the univariate analysis. Risk ratios (RRs) with
95% CIs were generated for each variable.

#### RESULTS

###### SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS
 A total of 3,582 (79.4%) children were interviewed with at least one version of the MINI-KID: 752 (21.0%) subjects completed one version of the MINI-KID and 2,830 (79.0%) subjects completed both child and parent version of the MINI-KID, respectively (Fig. 1). A total of 931 subjects were ineligible for the diagnostic interview for various reasons. Compared to the 3,582 completers, the 931 noncompleters had a higher proportion of rural kids (43.1% versus 38.2%, χ [2] = 7.39, P = .007) and older children (10.77 ± 3.42 versus 9.89 ± 2.53, t = 8.74, P < .001) but were comparable in the proportion of girls (45.0% versus 47.6%, χ [2] = 1.95, P = .162).
 Detailed socio-demographic, economic, parental, school, and family variables are shown in Table 1.

 PREVALENCE OF CHILDHOOD DDs
 The weighted prevalence of any DD was found to be 2.8% (95%CI: 1.5–3.9) (Table 2). Among the DDs, the most common category was MDD with a prevalence of 1.4% (95%CI: 1.0–1.8). Overall, DDs were significantly


###### f p

 more common among girls, rural children, and older kids.
 Figure 2 presented the gender-specific prevalence rates of DDs from ages 6–14. Rates were similar before the age of 9 and increased steadily after the age of 10 in both sexes, but were markedly higher in girls between the ages of 10 and 14.

 CORRELATES OF CHILDHOOD DDs
 In the multivariate analysis (the last column of Table 1), depression was significantly correlated with the older age groups (9–11-year old and 12–14-year old), not attending school, having unmarried parent(s), living in a nonnuclear family (single parent family or parentless family), being taken care of by people other than both parents (single parent, grandparent(s), other relatives, or others) during the past year, and not being breastfed be- fore 1 year of age.

 MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE USE OF DEPRESSIVE CHILDREN
 Only 5 (5.81%) children with depression had received professional help at some point in the past, and greater than 90% of the individuals with any DD never received any professional help (Table 3).

#### DISCUSSION

###### The present child depression survey was completed in one phase, and the majority of children and their guardians contributed information that was used to de- cide whether the child had a DD. This approach largely eliminated the loss of precision that may occur with a two-phase design. This survey was conducted in only one city of China, thus we should be cautious in gener- alizing our data. However, our study is one of the very few investigations that uses the MINI-KID, which is a strict standardized diagnostic evaluation tool adminis- tered by well-trained professional psychiatrists. The ad- vantage of interviews administered by professionals is that it increases the accuracy of the clinical relevance of the diagnoses.
 In a child and adolescent psychiatric assessment, it is typically recommended that data from multiple infor- mants be used, but there is still disagreement on how parent and child reports should be combined in epi- demiological studies.[[48]] While there may be discrep- ancies between the two versions of the MINI-KID, we believe that the diagnoses from both versions are valid, as the original version of the MINI-KID-P has been observed to have good concordance with the standard MINI-KID-C.[[49]] We also found a high concordance rate between the MINI-KID-C and the MINI-KID-P in this study. A DD is considered to be present if either the parent or child reported version satisfies DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. This “OR rule” helps to redress un- derreporting by one informant, and although it might be criticized as overinclusive, it seems to be more justified.

###### Alternatively, we can consider a diagnosis to be conferred only when both versions individually meet DD diagnos- tic criteria, which would be a very stringent demand, but this is rarely required by the DSM-IV for a diagnosis.
 In this study, the prevalence of at least one current DD in 6–14-year-old children was 2.8%. The overall preva- lence rates for DDs in our adolescent sample (4.6%) were comparable to those reported in a recent epidemiolog- ical survey of the adult Chinese population,[[50]] which suggests that adult DD might be adolescent DD in a recurrent form. As shown in Fig. 2, the gender dif- ference in rates of depression emerged during adoles- cence. This phenomenon might be an indirect reflec- tion of the association between pubertal status and de- pression in adolescent girls.[[51]] Six previous school-based surveys have reported that the current prevalence rates of DDs among Chinese children aged 5–17 years range between 0.93 and 1.62%[[23–26,52]] and 2.70%[[33]] in Chi- nese adolescents. Although our sample had a smaller age range (6–14 years), the overall prevalence of current de- pression in our study was still higher than the previ- ous findings reported for Chinese children and adoles

###### cents, even if MIDD was excluded. The current preva- lence of any DD in our study was lower than the fig- ures of depressive episode prevalence rates (2.92 and 4.80%) in two Chinese epidemiological surveys that used psychiatric interviews and ICD-10 criteria[[27,30]] but was significantly higher than the CCMD-3 (Chi- nese Classification of Mental Disorders, Third Edition) prevalence rates of two surveys (0% for both) that used psychiatric interviews[[29,34]] and the Weinberg Depres- sion Criteria[[53]] rate (1.85%).[[54]] Compared to west- ern studies, the present study found higher depres- sion prevalence rates than those reported previously in New Zealand (2.30%),[[55]] Spain (1.43%),[[42]] Britain (0.87%),[[41]] Brazil (1.00%),[[10]] Denmark (0.80%),[[32]] and Norway (0.18%).[[56]] After the exclusion of MIDD, the remaining prevalence rate (1.9%) was still higher than that of most western countries. This study also pre- sented higher depression prevalence rates when com- pared with those of developing countries in Asia (India: 0.10%,[[39]] Bangladesh:0.0%,[[40]] andYemen:0.30%[[31]]). However, three surveys that were conducted in Iran,[[38]] Turkey,[[22]] and India[[21]] reported higher prevalence rates than those of our study: 4.90, 4.20, and 3.13%, respectively. Although the prevalence and methodol- ogy of these surveys varied widely (Table 4), these

###### comparisons indicate that children in this part of China have a relatively high prevalence of depression.
 Analyses of related factors indicated that, in commu- nities, depression was more prevalent among kids who were older than 8 years, did not go to school, had un- married parent(s), were living in an incomplete family, were taken care of by people other than both parents, and were not breastfed before the age of 1 year. These findings indicate that the etiologies of childhood depres- sion are complex and multifactorial. In western coun- tries, many factors have been reported to be associated with early-onset depression, including the following: de- mographic factors (e.g. older age, female, low socioeco- nomic status),[[12,57,58]] familial factors (e.g. parental psy- chology, early-onset mood disorders, high familial load- ing for mood disorders),[[11,12,59]] family factors (e.g. fam- ily conflict, parental divorce)[[58–61]] and psychosocial fac- tors (e.g. poor support, stressful life events, poor mater- nal function).[[12]] The associations between age, marital status of parents and depression that we observed in our study are consistent with previous western studies. How- ever, most of our findings from the risk factor analysis are relatively inconsistent with those reported in west- ern countries. This phenomenon might be a reflection of cultural differences. Exposure to parental depression is an especially strong predictor of depression for western children and adolescents.[[62,63]] However, the association between family history of psychiatric illness and depres- sion disappeared in the multivariate analysis in our study. One possible explanation as to why a family history of psychiatric illness did not increase the risk for childhood depression is that the parents’ mental illness history was underreported because of the deep-rooted mental dis- ease stigma in the Chinese culture.[[64]] Interestingly, a rarely reported association between breastfeeding and depression was found in our study, which is partly con- sistent with a recent study showing that babies that were breastfed for longer than 6 months had significantly bet- ter mental health in childhood.[[65]]
 Subjects selected from schools are a biased subset of children with less disorders, less symptom severity, and less impairment than children from communities. Our study found that children who did not attend school had a higher risk for depression, thus supporting our pre- vious hypothesis that community children have higher depression prevalence than school children. Our find- ings on the associations between family types, dominant caregivers, and depression in the present study are very notable. Both findings clearly suggest that parents and family factors play an important role in the mental de- velopment of children. The national statistical data[[66]] indicates that the internal migration of the rural popu- lation has been a key force in the child care-taking pat- terns of the rural areas in contemporary China. Children in single-parent and grandparent-only families, or who were cared for by others, had poorer mental health than children living with two biological parents.[[67]] Despite the fact that the migration of parents out of rural ar- eas can lead to improvements in living conditions and


###### f p

 physical health of children, it may cause deficiencies in parenting. Children being left behind has been linked to disorders such as depression and anxiety.[[19,68]] In our sample, subjects who were cared for by people other than both parents accounted for 25.2% of the total sample (of the 25.2%, 80.8% were rural children), and 48.8% (42/86) of the depressed children were not cared for by their two biological parents. Thus, the high prevalence rate of DD in this study is not surprising.
 Unfortunately, among the 86 depressed children iden- tified from our study, only 5 (5.8%) ever sought help from mental health professionals for their depression. Viewed from a global perspective, the underutilization of mental health services by children is a universal prob- lem. In western countries, more than 70% of teenagers with DDs do not receive any form of diagnosis and treatment,[[56,69]], and a majority of psychosocial disor- ders in children have been missed.[[70]] Undoubtedly, the low service utilization rate is a greater problem in Chi- nese children. Possible reasons for this may include the stigma associated with depression, atypical clinical man- ifestation, a lack of adequate child mental health training for health care professionals, an inadequate number of child psychiatrists, a lower parental perceived need for children’s mental health care, and inequalities in mental health care insurance for rural children in China.
 This study has several limitations that should be noted. First, reliable assessment of depression in children re- quires gathering information from the parent, child, and teacher, as well as from all other available informants.[[71]] Our diagnoses of DDs based on parent and child re- ports has limitation, as teachers could supply more dis- ease information (i.e. irritability, peer relationship, and academic performance in school) of individuals with “difficult-to-diagnose” depression. Second, our study was primarily focused on the prevalence of depression but not on the correlates of depression, therefore, the problem of overfitting is inevitable in our logistic regres- sion model,[[72]] as we studied quite a few candidate pre- dictors but the number of detected depression (“events”) was relatively small. Although the risk factors identified in our study seem consistent with those in previous re- ports, whether they also apply to other regions in China is still questionable. Finally, as we used “OR rule” to gen- erate DD diagnoses, there should be a low prevalence in the 752 subjects who only completed one version of the MINI-KID, which indicated that the overall prevalence rates of DDs in our full sample might be underestimated. Meanwhile, the nonresponse bias from older and more rural subjects in nonrecruited sample also might make us underestimate the depression prevalence.

#### CONCLUSION

###### The present study has demonstrated a relatively high prevalence of depression and an extremely low men- tal health service utilization rate among a community- based sample of 6–14-year-old Chinese children. De- pression is a substantial and largely unrecognized issue

###### among children, which suggests that it has been a ma- jor public health issue for Chinese children. Given the many negative impacts of depression on our children and society, there is an urgent need to develop efficacious interventions aimed at the prevention and early recog- nition of childhood depression. There may be an even greater need for community-based programs to promote rural child and adolescent mental health.
