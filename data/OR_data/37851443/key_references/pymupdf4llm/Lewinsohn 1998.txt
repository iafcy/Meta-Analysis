### INTRODUCTION
# Knowledge regarding the degree to which treatment
is provided to children and adolescents for depression
is important for many reasons. For example, depression is one of the most common psychiatric conditions
of youth (Lewinsohn et al., 1993); it is associated with
poor psychosocial functioning (Lewinsohn et al.,
1994), and adolescent depression is often recurrent,
negatively impacting functioning in young adulthood
(Fleming et al., 1993; Garber et al., 1988; Harrington
et al., 1990; Kovacs, 1996). The first goal of the
present study was to extend previous findings regarding treatment utilization for childhood and adolescent psychopathology (Cuffe et al., 1995; Offord et
al., 1987) by ascertaining the extent of treatment
and the kinds of treatments being provided to this
age group.
A second goal was to pinpoint factors related to
treatment utilization. We hypothesized that adolescents with more severe depression, those with a
comorbid nonaffective disorder, those with school
problems, and those from disrupted families would be
more likely to receive treatment. A third goal of the
study was to examine whether there are any lasting
positive effects of treatment during childhood and

adolescence on functioning in young adulthood.
As per the literature, rates of treatment for adolescent depression in nonreferred community samples
range from 15% to 65% (Beardslee et al., 1985; Cuffe
et al., 1995; Goodman et al., 1997; Offord et al.,
1987). The most frequently used form of treatment
for child/adolescent depression is outpatient psychotherapy, with only a relatively small percentage of
young patients receiving antidepressant medication
(Kovacs et al., 1984; Keller et al., 1991).
The availability of data from a longitudinal study of
community individuals who were assessed at two points
during adolescence and again in young adulthood provided a unique opportunity to examine the impact of

treatment utilization on the probability of relapse in
those who had recovered from their episode. In a previous report of results from this sample (Lewinsohn et al.,
1995), we focused on the clinical consequences of
comorbidity and reported the rate of treatment to be
higher for comorbid disorders than for pure disorders,
for female adolescents than for males, and for adolescents who did not live with both biological parents.

### METHODS
**SAMPLE**

Participants were adolescents who were randomly selected from nine senior high schools in western Oregon.
A total of 1,709 adolescents completed the initial (T1)
assessments (interview and questionnaires) between 1987
and 1989, with an overall participation rate of 61%
(additional details are provided in Lewinsohn et al.,
1993). At the second assessment (T2), 1,507 participants (88.2%) returned for a readministration of the interview and questionnaire (mean T1-T2 interval = 13.8
months, S.D. = 2.3). Differences between the sample and
the larger population from which it was selected, and between participants and those who declined to participate
or dropped out of the study, were small.
As participants reached their 24th birthday, subjects
with a history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
and other psychopathology at T2 were invited to participate in a T3 telephone interview (Rohde et al.,
1997) as were an approximately equal number of randomly selected control subjects with no history of
mental disorder at T2. Of the T3 assessments currently in progress, 627 subjects had data available for
the present study (T2 history of MDD, n = 220; T2
history of nonaffective disorder, n = 162; T2 history of
no disorder, n = 245). The mean follow-up interval
between T2 and T3 was 6.1 years (S.D. = 1.0; range =
3.0–8.7).

**DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW**

Participants were interviewed at T1 with a version
of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS), which
combined features of the Epidemiologic version (KSADS-E; Orvaschel et al., 1982) and the Present Episode version (K-SADS-P), and included additional items
to derive diagnoses of psychiatric disorders as per DSMIII-R criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 1987).
At T2 and T3, subjects were interviewed using the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE; Shapiro
and Keller, unpublished), which elicits detailed information about the course of psychiatric symptoms and disorders since the previous K-SADS interview.

**MEASURES**
**Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS;**
**Hamilton, 1960). As a measure of depressive epi-**
sode severity, a 14-item version of the HDRS was
completed for current and worst past depressive
symptoms.


**History of suicide attempt. As part of the inter-**
view assessments of depression, adolescents were
asked: “Have you ever tried to kill yourself or done
anything that could have killed you?” A history of a
suicide attempt (presence or absence) by T2 was used.
**Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression**
**Scale. (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). The 20-item CES-**
D was completed by subjects at T1 and T2. The
highest CES-D total score from the T1 and T2 assessments was used in the present study.
**Academic problems. Nine items were combined**
into an aggregate measure of academic problems: lifetime occurrence of school expulsion or suspension, truancy, or repeating a grade; mean grade point average;
low adolescent and parent satisfaction with grades; frequent school absenteeism, tardiness, and homework
incompletion. Items were standardized and summed; the
distribution was then dichotomized at one standard deviation above the mean.
**Mental health treatment utilization. Information**
regarding lifetime outpatient, inpatient, and medication treatment was collected at each assessment. If the
participant had received outpatient treatment, type of
treatment (individual, family, alcohol or drug treatment support groups, other group treatment), provider (mental health professional, school counselor/
staff, clergy), length of treatment (1–2 sessions, 3–7
sessions, 8–26 sessions, more than 26 sessions total),
and age of first outpatient contact were ascertained. If
the participant had received inpatient treatment, type
(alcohol and drug treatment, psychiatric treatment),
length (less than 1 month, 1 month or greater), age at
first hospitalization, and number of hospitalizations
were recorded. If psychoactive medication was prescribed, information was obtained regarding the type of
medication (antidepressants, sedatives or minor tranquilizers, stimulants, and “other”).

**DIAGNOSTIC GROUPS**

Three depression groups were formed based on a
combination of their diagnostic status up to T2 and
their CES-D scores at T1 and T2: (1) MDD (n = 356)
consisted of adolescents who met DSM-III-R criteria
for major depressive disorder at or prior to T2; (2)
Subsyndromal (n = 218) consisted of adolescents who
scored at least one standard deviation above the
sample mean on the CES-D (i.e., 27) at either T1 or
T2 but did not meet diagnostic criteria for MDD;
and (3) Never Depressed (n = 900) consisted of adolescents who scored less than 27 on both CES-D administrations and did not meet criteria for MDD at
or before T2.
Depression group membership was associated with
several demographic factors and with nonaffective disorder (for each contrast, rates are given for the MDD,
Subsyndromal, and Never Depressed groups, respectively). Depression group was associated with gender
(70.5%, 48.2%, and 48.2% female); χ[2](2, n = 1,474) =
53.96, _P < .001; age (60.1%, 42.7%, and 46.1% were_


-----

in the older half of the sample); χ[2](2, n = 1,474) =
24.10, P < .001; living situation (43.0%, 56.0%, 58.7%
were living with both biological parents); χ[2](2, n =
1,474) = 25.56, P < .001; maximum parental education
(40.4%, 45.0%, 50.3% had higher parental education);
χ[2](2, n = 1,474) = 10.01, P < .01; and the presence of a
nonaffective disorder (47.8%, 34.4%, 19.7%); χ[2](2, n
= 1,474) = 102.66, P < .001. Depression group was not
associated with race.

### RESULTS
**PROVISION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES**
**TO DEPRESSED ADOLESCENTS**

Table 1 shows the lifetime treatment utilization information for the total sample. A substantial proportion of adolescents received some form of mental
health service, which virtually always consisted of outpatient treatment. Less than one in twelve of those re

ceiving outpatient treatment also received inpatient
treatment, and approximately one-eighth of the adolescents receiving outpatient services also received
medication.
The rates of various mental health services for the
Never Depressed, the Subsyndromal, and the MDD
groups are also shown in Table 1. Overall group differences in treatment utilization were statistically significant for each of the three forms of mental health
treatment (outpatient, medication, and inpatient).

**FACTORS RELATED TO TREATMENT**
**UTILIZATION**

Mental health treatment utilization was associated
with gender (46.1% of females vs. 32.2% of males received treatment) but not with age or parental education. The significant association between gender and
treatment utilization was not due to the fact that
females had a higher rate of MDD; controlling for de

pression group membership, gender remained significantly associated with treatment utilization; likelihood
ratio χ[2] (1, n=1474) = 16.28, P < .001.
The association between treatment and family
structure was examined by classifying adolescents into
four groups: adolescents living with a single mother, a
single father, a biological parent and stepparent, and
two biological parents. Treatment utilization rates significantly differed across the four groups; χ[2 ] (3, n=
1474) = 68.59, _P < .001. Treatment rates were signifi-_
cantly greater for adolescents living with single mothers,
single fathers, and stepfamilies (53.8%, 52.2%, and
47.8%, respectively) compared to adolescents living in
intact families (30.1%). Interactions with gender were
nonsignificant. Differences in treatment utilization rates
for the three depressiion groups remained significant after controlling for relevant demographic factors and the
co-occurrence of a non-affective disorder; utilization ratio χ[2] (2, n= 1474) = 45.50, P < .001.
The association of several factors with mental
health treatment for adolescents with a history of
MDD at T2 is shown in Table 2. Each of the variables
was significantly associated with treatment utilization,
as indicated by the unadjusted odds ratios (ORs). After
adjusting for the impact of all the other variables using
multiple logistic regression (MLR), treatment rates
for depressed adolescents were significantly greater
given psychiatric comorbidity, a history of suicide attempt, poor academic performance, female gender,
and a nonintact family. The MLR correctly classified
68.5% of the MDD adolescents (a comparable multiple regression resulted in an _R = .40, accounting for_
16.0% of the variance in treatment utilization).


**IMPACT OF ADOLESCENT TREATMENT ON**
**OCCURRENCE OF DEPRESSION IN YOUNG**
**ADULTHOOD**
Of the 627 subjects who have completed the T3
interview to date, 228 (36.4%) reported experiencing
an episode of MDD between T2 and T3 (this rate is
not representative of the general community because
participants with a previous disorder were oversampled). As expected, T2 depression group membership was highly associated with future MDD
episodes; χ[2](1, n = 627) = 35.52, _P < .001. The inci-_
dence rates of MDD were 25.5%, 42.4%, and 50.0%
in the Never Depressed, Subsyndromal, and MDD
groups, respectively.
Contrary to expectation, MDD incidence rate was
higher for subjects who had received treatment (47.1%
vs. 27.1%); χ[2](1, n = 627) = 26.94, P < .001. Even when
controlling for differences in T2 depression group status, gender, and the presence of nonaffective disorder
during adolescent, the difference between treated and
untreated groups remained significant. In an effort to
clarify this counterintuitive finding, subsequent analyses were computed separately for the MDD and the
subsyndromal depression groups. For subjects with a
history of MDD at T2, a trend was present for those
who had received treatment to have a higher rate of
future MDD (54.6% vs. 41.8%); χ[2](1, n = 220) = 3.34,
_P = .068. Because formerly depressed females were_
more likely to relapse ([55.2% vs. 34.5%]; χ[2][1,n =
220] = 7.01, _P < .01), treatment utilization and future_
MDD were examined separately for females and males.
Among MDD female participants, previous treatment

was unrelated to future depression relapse (56.8% relapse among treated females vs. 51.9% among nontreated); χ[2](1, n = 165) = 0.35, _P > .05. Among MDD_
male participants, previous treatment was associated
with greater relapse (46.7% relapse among treated
males vs. 20.0% among nontreated); χ[2](1, n = 55) =
4.29, _P < .05. For subjects with subsyndromal depres-_
sion at T2, the provision of mental health treatment
was unrelated to future occurrence of MDD, although
the pattern was in a similar direction. Almost half of
the T2 Subsyndromal adolescents who received treatment (48.8%) experienced their first episode of MDD
by T3, compared with 36.6% of nontreated subsyndromal adolescents; χ[2](1, n = 84) = 1.29, P > .05.
In a final attempt to explain the counterintuitive
findings, a series of analyses restricted to subjects who
had received treatment during adolescence was performed. The rates of future depression were unrelated to: (a) treatment provider (45.1% of adolescents
treated by a mental health professional had a future
MDD vs. 44.5% of those treated by others); χ[2](1, n =
271) = 0.01, _P > .05; (b) treatment type (46.5% of_
adolescents receiving individual treatment had a future MDD vs. 37.9% receiving another modality);
χ[2](1, n = 271) = 1.35, P > .05; or (c) age of first outpatient treatment; likelihood ratio χ[2] (1, n = 271) = 0.18,
_P > .05.. The rates of future depression were higher_
given a greater duration of previous treatment (52.4%
of adolescents receiving 8 or more sessions had a future MDD vs. 38.0% of those receiving 1–7 sessions);
χ[2](1, n = 271) = 5.55, P < .05.

### DISCUSSION

We found treatment utilization for depressed adolescents to be higher than has been reported in some
previous studies (Goodman et al., 1997; Keller et al.,
1991; Offord et al., 1987) but comparable in magnitude to the rates reported in a recent study by Cuffe et
al. (1995). As expected, treatment utilization increased
as a function of depression level. It is important to
note that the treatment rate for the Subsyndromal
group was significantly higher than that of the Never
Depressed group. Subclinical or subthreshold depression is being increasingly recognized as a significant
clinical condition with associated psychosocial impairments. In interpreting the relatively high rate of treatment utilization for the Never Depressed group, it
needs to be kept in mind that this group included adolescents with a history of nonaffective disorders. The
modal treatment was individual outpatient psychotherapy provided by mental health providers and
slightly under half received 8 or more sessions of
treatment. Inpatient treatment was relatively rare and
typically was provided to those whose depression was
comorbid with alcohol and drug abuse/dependence.
In addition to depression severity, the presence of a
comorbid nonaffective disorder, the number of MDD
episodes, the history of a suicide attempt, the presence


of academic problems, disruptive family structure, and
being female were all positively related to treatment
utilization. The odds ratios for all of these factors indicated that the variable generally doubled the likelihood of treatment. However, the variables, taken in
combination, had limited predictive ability. Future
studies need to identify other variables that were not
included in our study which lead to mental health
treatment utilization for depressed adolescents.
Those who had received treatment were not less
likely to experience a new episode of depression during young adulthood. Actually, the trend was in the
opposite direction, and formerly depressed boys who
had received treatment were more likely to have relapsed. Our attempts to account for this finding in
terms of initial severity differences between those who
received and those who did not receive treatment were
not borne out. Existing treatment outcome studies have
generally focused on the short-term effects of treatment
(Kazdin, 1993). To our knowledge this is the only study
that has examined the long-term effects of outpatient
treatment in a community sample. Clearly, the finding of
negative relationship between treatment and prognosis is
provocative and needs to be cross-validated. While relapse is only one criterion of long-term treatment efficacy, it is clearly a very important one.
Two possible explanations can be offered for this
counterintuitive finding. First, other factors (which
were not measured in the present study) which have
negative prognostic implications may be correlated
with being referred for treatment. For example, boys
who were living in especially stressful environments
may have been selected for treatment but living in the
same bad environment might have undone the initial
benefits derived from treatment. Another possibility is
that the effects of treatment do not extend into the
future far enough to prevent relapse. The question
that is being raised by our findings is: Are there any
lasting beneficial effects from treatments? This needs
to be addressed by future research.
Limitations of our study include the fact that we did
not have a measure of treatment “adequacy.” Some
(Keller et al., 1991) have suggested that depressed
children often receive inadequate services. Admittedly,
“adequacy” of treatment, either as per clinical judgement or as per empirical studies, is a difficult construct to measure, but clearly psychotherapy covers a
multitude of interventions and some of these are
probably better than others. Another limitation of our
study is that our measure of treatment utilization is
entirely based on self-report by the adolescent.
While there is no a priori reason to question the
veridicality of these self-reports, independent corroboration would have been desirable.
A number of the findings which are being reported
for the first time in this paper will be addressed in future publications, such as the very high rate of relapse
among those who had an episode of MDD during
adolescence, and the fact that the MDD incidence rate

was also high among those with subthreshold depression in adolescence.
