Background
Depression is one of the leading causes of disease burden and disability across all age groups [1] and a major
risk factor for suicide, substance abuse and serious
social and educational impairments [2–4]. Although adolescents are often considered as a healthy population,
they appear to be particularly vulnerable to depressive
disorders [5]. Prevalence rates in childhood are low
with no gender differences [6] and then increase significantly in adolescence, while gender differences emerge

[7, 8]. Estimated 1-year prevalence rates of unipolar depression in mid to late adolescence range between 4–5 %

and are comparable to those observed in the adult population [9, 10], while the cumulative probability of depression
by the end of adolescence appears to be as high as 20 %

[11, 12]. During the last decades the prevalence of depression in adolescence appears to have increased in the most
recent birth cohorts [13]. Although it is not yet clear if this
is due to a pure rise in the prevalence of the disorder or if
it can be at least partially attributed to methodological
problems, the World Health Organization reports a rise in
the burden of depression globally and a World Health
Assembly resolution in May 2012 called for a coordinated
response to mental disorders at country level [14]. In
Greece there has been limited research on the epidemiology of depressive disorders in adolescence. A recent
study, which investigated depressive symptomatology in
Greek adolescents attending senior high schools, reported

a prevalence rate of 26.2 % [15]. An earlier study has also
shown high prevalence of depressive symptoms in adolescents aged 12–17 years old [16]. A recent study in Greek
adults reported that one month prevalence rate of major
depression in the subgroup of youth under 24 years old
increased considerably between the years 2008 and 2011.
In the same study, younger age was identified as a risk factor for major depression in the Greek population [17].
However, it is worth noting that the above mentioned
study was a telephone survey. Another study of Greek
adults, which has implemented a different sampling
procedure and has used a fully structured psychiatric
interview, reported a lower prevalence rate of depression, which increased with age [18].

Depression in adolescence shows substantial comorbidity with anxiety and substance abuse disorders and
this finding has been well established through various
studies [19]. Comorbid disorders are more common
than the “pure” types, while comorbidity between anxiety and depressive disorders in adolescents is greater
than within the diagnostic group of anxiety disorders.
Another common finding regarding adolescent depression is the relatively low use of health services, despite
the high prevalence and disability associated with the
disorder. Health services utilization appears to be even
lower in cases of non-comorbid depression [20].

Regarding the correlates of depression, beyond the
well established sociodemographic factors of age and
gender, socioeconomic factors are also important. A
socioeconomic gradient in adolescent depression has
been documented in both the United States and Europe.
Similarly to findings reported by studies in adults [21],
lower socioeconomic status has been correlated with a
greater prevalence of depression in adolescents [22].

The aim of the present study was to investigate the
prevalence, comorbidity and sociodemographic/ socioeconomic associations of depressive disorders and depressive
symptoms, as well as some aspects of the health services
use, in late adolescents in Greece. Greece has recently entered a long period of economic crisis with fundamental
adverse effects on many areas of the life of the population.
Our study took place during the years 2007 and 2008 just
before the eruption of the 2009 financial crisis. We therefore consider as important the investigation of some significant mental health aspects of Greek adolescents during
the crucial period that preceded the onset of the current
socioeconomic crisis.

Methods
Description of the data set
The data reported here are derived from the “Epirus
School Project” [23] which is a cross-sectional survey
carried out in selected upper secondary schools in Greece.
The study was approved by the Ethical committee of the


Ministry of Education and the Greek Educational Institute
and was conducted according to the Helsinki declaration.
The study was also approved by the Head of each participating School. All students in the selected schools were
invited to participate in the study, while the participation
was voluntary. Consent was actively obtained from both
the students and their parents.

Secondary education in Greece
Secondary education in Greece is distinguished into
lower secondary (grades 7–9; ages 13–15 years; attendance is compulsory) and upper secondary (grades 10–12;
ages 16–18 years; attendance is not compulsory). Upper
secondary schools are further distinguished into senior
high schools (Lyceum) and technical vocational schools
with the majority of students (75 %) attending senior
high schools. In the “Epirus School Project” only senior
high schools were selected (age of pupils 16–18 years).
At the time of the design of the study approximately
75,000 students attended 1,193 senior high schools in
Greece.

Sampling of schools and pupils
Schools were selected according to the following rules:
a) all senior high schools of the major cities in the
north-western part of Greece (regions of Epirus and
Aetoloakarnania) due to the proximity of this area to the
University of Ioannina, b) all senior high schools in one
randomly selected district of the Athens Metropolitan
Area (the district of Kallithea was selected), c) all senior
high schools of the island of Paros in the Aegean Sea
(the island was conveniently selected due to the close
collaboration of the schools and mental health units of
the island with the Panteion University). A total of 25
schools took part in the study. The mean number of
participants per school was 267 pupils ranging from 100
to 502. The main fieldwork took place between January
2007 and April 2008.

Design of the study and data collection procedure
The study used a two-phase design [24]. In the first
phase, all consenting students (N = 5,614, response rate
82 %) were administered a brief screening instrument in
the classroom. The screening instrument of the first
phase was developed from the revised clinical interview
schedule (CIS-R) used in the second phase of the study.
Students were selected for the second phase psychiatric
interview using a stratified random sampling procedure
according to the scores on the screening questionnaire:
100 % of those scoring high on the screening instrument
(>75th percentile), 30 % of those scoring in the middle
and 10 % of those scoring low (<25th percentile). The
second phase (N = 2,431, response rate 95 %) consisted of
the computerized version of a fully-structured psychiatric


-----

interview (see next section) and was carried out in the
computer laboratories of the schools. It is noted that in
two schools (both in the island of Paros) all consenting
students were interviewed (that is the two phases were
merged into one). The reason was the availability of the
fieldworkers of the island of Paros, which allowed us to
provide the instrument of the CIS-R interview in full to all
consenting students. From the remaining 1,960 pupils
who were selected according to the stratified random sampling procedure, 926 (47.2 %) were on the 100 % stratum,
866 (44.2 %) on the 30 % stratum and 168 (8.6 %) on the
10 % stratum. Four out of the 2,431 selected pupils had
missing values on the sociodemographic questions (administered in the first phase of the study) and therefore
2,427 pupils were used in the final analysis.

Assessment of psychiatric morbidity: the revised clinical
interview schedule (CIS-R)
Depressive and other psychiatric symptoms were assessed
with the revised clinical interview schedule (CIS-R), a fully
structured psychiatric interview designed to be used by
trained lay interviewers [25]. The CIS-R was the main
instrument used in the national psychiatric morbidity
surveys in the UK [26] and has been used in several other
similar surveys around the world. A computerized version
has also been developed and found to be comparable with
the regular interview [27]. The CIS-R was originally designed to assess symptoms in participants above 16 years
old but has been previously used in teenagers above
14 years old in Australia [28]. The CIS-R assesses the
presence and severity of 14 common psychiatric symptoms (psychosomatic symptoms, fatigue, concentration/
memory problems, sleep problems, irritability, depressive
mood, depressive ideas, general worry, worry about physical health, free-floating anxiety, phobias, panic anxiety,
compulsions and obsessions). Two screening questions in
each section ask about the presence of the symptom during the past month and then there is a more detailed assessment of the presence, frequency, duration and severity
of the symptom during the past seven days. Based on the
above-mentioned characteristics of the symptoms each
one of the 14 symptoms is rated with an individual score
on a scale ranging from 0 to 4 (except depressive ideas
scored from 0 to 5). In the first phase of the study we
used the screening questions of the several symptom
sections of the CIS-R. The full interview was taken by
those students selected for the second phase of the
study. Additional questions enable the application of
the International Classification of Diseases – 10th edition (ICD-10) research diagnostic criteria for common
mental disorders (including depressive episode, phobic
disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder
and obsessive-compulsive disorder) using specially developed computerized algorithms.


The Greek version of the CIS-R was translated and
back-translated using the procedure recommended by
[the World Health Organization http://www.who.int/sub-](http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/research_tools/translation/en/index.html)
[stance_abuse/research_tools/translation/en/index.html.](http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/research_tools/translation/en/index.html)
The psychometric properties of the Greek version of
the CIS-R including its factor structure and internal
consistency have been reported by Skapinakis et al. 2011

[29]. A test-retest reliability of the CIS-R was carried out
in a subset of the present data set (two schools of the city
of Ioannina with an interval between assessments of
2 weeks) and was found to be 0.84 [23].

Assessment of depressive episode and depressive
symptoms
As mentioned above, there are two depression-related
sections in the CIS-R: in the first section (“depressive
mood) respondents are asked about feeling sad, miserable or depressed, or being unable to enjoy or take an
interest in things. More detailed questions ask about the
frequency and intensity of these symptoms. In the second section (“depressive ideas”), respondents are asked
about feelings of guilt, inadequacy and hopelessness and
whether they thought that life was not worth living.
Additional questions throughout the remaining CIS-R
sections enable the application of ICD-10 diagnostic
criteria for depressive episode. For the purposes of the
present paper we defined a single variable for depressive
episode, which includes all severities of depressive episodes according to ICD-10 (mild, moderate, severe). The
reason was that we expected very low prevalence rates
of the more severe types of the disorder, since our sample were active pupils able to attend school. Apart from
this formal definition of depression, in our analyses we
have also used a broader definition of “depressive symptoms” irrespectively of meeting the ICD-10 diagnostic
criteria for a depressive episode. This was defined as
having a score of two or more (denoting presence of
clinically significant symptoms) in both the “depressive
mood” and “depressive ideas” sections of the CIS-R.

Socioeconomic and sociodemographic variables
Information about several sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables was obtained from the students in
the first phase of the study. The variables included:
gender, own age, parent’s age, parent’s marital status,
number of brothers and sisters, mother’s educational
status, father’s educational status, mother’s employment
status, and father’s employment status. The variable of
the employment status of the mother included the additional category “looks after the house”, which was not
included in the employment status of the father, since a
considerable proportion of women, but not men, in
Greece choose to stay out of the labour market, in
order to look after the house. Students were also asked


-----

to subjectively rate their academic performance in school
on a 4-point scale (excellent, very good, good, fair). In
Greece, where typical 16–18 years-old adolescents have
not yet entered the labour market, neither have they completed their education, own educational level or occupation cannot be used as a measure of personal social
position. Academic performance in school has been often
used in the literature as a measure of the social position of
the pupils in school [30–32]. Further, adolescents were
asked to rate their relationship with mother and father
(excellent, very good, good, fair, bad). In addition we asked
students to subjectively assess their family’s financial condition by asking them whether their family was having any
financial difficulties. The specific question asked was:
“How do you think that your family is doing financially?”
The possible answers included: “My family experiences no
financial difficulties”, “My family experiences very few financial difficulties”, “My family experiences some financial
difficulties” and “My family experiences a lot of financial
difficulties”.

Other variables
We obtained information about the use of health services
in the second phase of the study. The specific question
asked was: “How many times did you consult a doctor
(family doctor, pediatrician, hospital doctor or any other
doctor) for any reason during the last 12 months?” The
possible answers were: “None”, “1-2 times”, “3-4 times”,
“5-6 times”, “7-10 times” and “More than 10 times”. A
second similar question followed, asking about doctor
consultations specifically for a psychological reason. Additionally, we have investigated the use of substances, such
as alcohol, nicotine and cannabis. For the purposes of the
present paper we have defined frequent alcohol use as the
consumption of hard liquor at least once weekly, smoking
as smoking cigarettes daily and cannabis use as having
tried cannabis at least once in their life.

Statistical analyses
The analyses were all conducted using the statistical
software package STATA 12.0. To take into account the
potential effect of clustering of our data (since adolescents were nested into 25 schools) we first carried out a
two-level logistic model (level 1: individuals, level 2:
schools) in Stata using the gllamm command [33]. We
also performed the models with the survey commands
of Stata using school as the stratum. Results were very
similar with both models and therefore in the paper we
present the results using the survey commands because
their use is more widespread in the literature. It should
be noted that the effect of schools was negligible with an
intraclass correlation coefficient close to zero (<0.08). In
all analyses we have used probability weights to take into
account the stratified random sampling procedure.


The associations between health measures and sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables were investigated using logistic regression models. We used two
dependent variables: (i) meeting the criteria for a depressive episode according to ICD-10 and (ii) experiencing
substantial depressive symptoms (depressive mood and
depressive ideas concurrently), irrespectively of meeting
the criteria of a depressive episode. For each dependent
variable we have initially calculated odds ratios adjusted
only for age and gender and then odds ratios adjusted
additionally for all other variables. Comorbidity was
investigated using odds ratios calculated from logistic
regression models, where the comorbid condition was
the dependent variable and depression (either yes or no)
the independent variable. Using similar models we investigated the use of health services. Frequent doctor visits
was the dependent variable and was defined as having
visited a doctor more than twice during the previous
12 months for any reason or at least once for a psychological reason. For the purposes of the latter analysis we
have created a variable for depression with three values:
“no depression”, “pure depression” (meeting the criteria
for a depressive episode only) and “comorbid depression” (meeting the criteria for a depressive episode and
for at least one anxiety disorder).

Results
Description of the sample
Overall 5,614 students took part in the first phase of
the study (55 % girls, 41 % 10th grade, 31 % 11th grade,
28 % 12th grade), while 2,431 students were interviewed
in the second phase (59 % girls, 39 % 10th grade, 32 %
11th grade, 29 % 12th grade). A detailed table of the sociodemographic characteristics of the whole sample in both
phases of the study is given in Additional file 1: Table S1.
Due to the stratified sampling procedure there were more
female than male students in the second phase.

Prevalence of depression
The prevalence of “depressive episode” according to the
ICD-10 and “depressive symptoms” by gender are
shown in Table 1. For all variables investigated prevalence was significantly higher among the girls in our
sample (p < 0.001). Having concurrent depressive symptoms only (17.4 %, 95 % CI: 15.81-19.17) was three
times more common than suffering a depressive episode according to the criteria of ICD-10 (5.7 %, 95 %
CI: 4.90-6.56).

Figure 1 presents the reason reported by respondents
about their depressed mood (“What sorts of things
made you feel sad, miserable or depressed or unable to
enjoy or take an interest in things in the past week?).
The most common reasons were “my psychological
condition” (24 %) and “problems with relationships

physical health” (2.2 %).

Co-morbidity
Table 2 presents the co-morbidity rates of depressive
episode with main anxiety disorders and alcohol, smoking and cannabis use. 49.4 % of the adolescents with
depressive episode had at least one comorbid anxiety
disorder, while the respective frequency for adolescents
without depression was 9.4 % [OR: 7.76 (5.52-10.92)].
All anxiety disorders were significantly more common
among depressive adolescents. The strongest association was reported for generalized anxiety [OR: 7.92
(5.35-11.74)]. 24.5 % of the adolescents with depression
reported consuming hard liquor at least once weekly

[OR: 1.85 (1.27-2.70)], 22 % responded smoking cigarettes daily [OR: 2.05 (1.39-3.04)], while 10.3 % reported having used cannabis at least once [OR: 3.48
(2.05-5.93)].


Use of health services
The use of health services is shown in Table 3. 10.4 %
of the adolescents with “pure” depression (non-comorbid) and 23.9 % of those with comorbid depression had
visited a doctor for a mental health reason at least
once during the previous year. On the whole 17.1 % of
the adolescents with a current depressive episode had
seen a doctor for a psychological problem or symptom
during the previous year. Statistically significant differences in frequent doctor visits were observed for adolescents who received at least two diagnoses and only
for consultations due to psychological reasons [OR:
2.54 (1.55-4.19)].

gender was statistically significantly associated with a
higher risk for both dependent variables investigated in
our analyses. The association was stronger for depressive
episode [OR: 3.93 (2.65-5.82)]. Older age as expressed by
the school grade of the pupils [OR: 1.69 (1.16-2.47)] and
having one sibling [OR: 2.20 (1.17-4.13)] were both significantly associated with a greater risk for depressive episode
according to ICD-10. Parent’s divorce or separation [OR:
2.02 (1.34-3.03)] was associated with an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms.

Regarding parent’s employment status, the retirement of
the father was significantly associated with a lower risk for


depressive episode [OR: 0.39 (0.16-0.99)]. Some or a lot
financial difficulties in the family showed a statistically
significant association with both dependent variables.
School performance was not associated at a statistically
significant level with our dependent variables. We have,
however, performed separate analyses for the boys and
girls in our sample and we found that lower academic performance increases the risk of depressive episode only for
the boys of the sample [OR: 2.72 (1.28-5.78)].

Discussion
Main findings
5.7 % of the adolescents in our sample met the criteria
of a depressive episode according to ICD-10. One in two
adolescents with depression reported at least one comorbid anxiety disorder. Frequent doctor consultations due
to psychological reasons were positively associated with
depression. Less than one in five depressed adolescents
had visited a doctor during the previous 12 months due
to a mental health reason. A number of sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors were associated with
adolescents’ depression. Among them, the presence of
financial difficulties in the family, as perceived by the
adolescent, was significantly associated with both depressive outcomes investigated in the present paper.

Comparison with other studies
The prevalence rate of depression found in our study is
similar to ones reported by other studies conducted in
Europe and the Unites States. Costello et al. performed a
large meta-analysis of approximately 60,000 children
born over the past 30 years, from studies that had used
a structured psychiatric interview to assess depression.
For the subgroup of adolescents aged 13–18 years old
they reported an overall prevalence estimate of 5.6 %

[10]. Past studies in adolescent populations in Greece
have not used structured psychiatric interviews and have
mainly assessed depressive symptoms. Previous studies
have chosen measures, such as the CES-D scale (center

for epidemiological studies of depression scale) [15, 16]
or the Delusions Symptoms States Inventory/states of
Anxiety and Depression [34]. The most recent among
the studies in Greek adolescents showed a prevalence
rate of depressive symptomatology equal to 26.2 % [15],
a figure which is somewhat higher than our estimate of
17.4 %. Studies conducted during the ‘90s on similar
samples, found rates of depressive symptoms of as high
as 33.4 % for males and 60.6 % for females [34] or even
higher [16]. The observed differences could be explained
through the different sampling frame and instruments
used. Structured interviews, such as the CIS-R, may be
more conservative in their estimate of symptoms compared to simpler scales [35].

Depression was significantly more common among the
girls in our sample (p < 0.001).

Gender differences in the prevalence of depression
among adolescents have been well established with approximately twice as many females than males reporting
depressive disorders in mid-adolescence [7]. It is not yet
clear whether the observed differences are real or emerge
due to methodological issues [36]. Misclassification of
questionnaires has been reported and it has been discussed that some items (like crying and lost interest in
sex) are related in certain ways to female gender and,
therefore, give gender-biased results in measuring depressiveness [37]. In the present study the assessment of
depressiveness is based on a fully structured psychiatric
interview and not only on a questionnaire. As a result, it is
expected that the variation found may be less attributable
to methodological artefacts.

Almost half of the adolescents with depression in the
present study were presented with at least one comorbid anxiety disorder. The finding is consistent with
figures reported by studies conducted in different populations. Comorbidity rates of as high as 75 % have been
shown in some clinical samples [38, 39], with rates between 20 and 50 % more likely to be reported [40, 41].
An interesting consideration regarding comorbidity
rates between depression and anxiety is the one stated
by some researchers, who point out that studies may
underestimate rates, since major depression accompanied by subclinical anxiety would not qualify as comorbidity [39]. The co-occurring anxiety, however, though


subclinical at the moment, may have significant clinical
implications later in development.

Alcohol, cigarette smoking and cannabis use were significantly more common among adolescents with depression in our study. The strong relationship between
alcohol use and major depressive disorder in adolescents
has been noted by many previous studies [42–44]. Theories about their etiological relation have proposed that
depression increases the risk of alcohol dependence [45].
On the other hand, however, there is evidence that alcohol use disorders may not only exacerbate, but may also
induce depression [46].

Cannabis use and depression are presented commonly as comorbid conditions in clinical and community populations [47, 48]. Nevertheless, the degree and
the direction of their causal relation is a subject of controversy. Adolescents may use cannabis as a self-medication
for their feelings of dysphoria, but cannabis use itself may
significantly worsen, or even induce, such feelings [49, 50].
A number of cohort and well-designed cross-sectional
studies have shown that it is the heavy and problematic
cannabis use, rather than the infrequent one, which is associated with depression [51]. Our study, however, did not
aim at exploring the effect of the frequency of cannabis
use on depression.

Similarly, a number of epidemiological studies have
investigated the association of cigarette smoking with
adolescents’ mental health disorders [52, 53]. While
externalizing disorders, such as conduct disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been
consistently related to adolescents’ cigarette smoking [54],
findings about internalizing disorders, such as depression
and anxiety, appear to be contradictory. Some studies
report a significant relationship between these disorders
and smoking [55, 56], while others have not confirmed
any significant association [57, 58]. A recent study in
Greek adolescents has shown that cigarette smoking was
strongly associated with higher levels of emotional/ behavioural problems and the association was not moderated
after controlling for the effects of possible covariates [59].

The present study presented evidence of socioeconomic inequalities in adolescent depression. On the
whole, the association between socioeconomic position
and depression across the lifespan remains a controversial


-----

area. Although lower socioeconomic status shows a robust
association with high psychiatric morbidity, the results for
depression are ambiguous [60]. In our study the socioeconomic risk factor was conceptualized through the financial
difficulties of the family, as perceived and reported by the
adolescent. Our finding is consistent with previous studies, which showed that adolescents, who thought that their
socioeconomic status was somewhat or much worse off
than their peers had a higher prevalence of depression

[22]. In our study both depression according to ICD-10
and depressive symptoms correlated with financial difficulties of the family. Other studies, which investigated depressive symptomatology, have also reported associations
with subjective measures of adolescent socioeconomic
status [61]. A number of theories have tried to identify the
pathways linking socioeconomic status and depression

[62]. According to the stress theory lower socioeconomic
status is associated on the one hand with higher levels of
chronic stress due to financial difficulties, family problems
and adverse living conditions, and with lower levels of
personal resources, such as coping style, self-esteem, mastery and locus of control on the other. Many studies in
depression are consistent with the above mentioned theory, while evidence supporting the strain theory, which
underlines the decisive role of contextual and community
features such as values, social welfare, social cohesion,
infrastructure and policies, is conflicting [60]. Some researchers suggest that social determinants of health may
be also explainable through the mechanism of status comparisons [63]. In our study we have not asked the adolescents about their family income. It is expected that one
part of the information obtained through the question
about the financial difficulties of the families of the adolescents may be related to aspects relevant to social comparisons. Likewise, the association in the boys of our sample
of depression with lower academic performance, which
could be seen as an indicator of the social position of the
pupil in the school context, may also reflect a process of
social comparisons among the adolescents.

Finally, the present study reports an association between depression and service utilization as expressed
by frequent doctor consultations. The finding is consistent with previous studies suggesting that adolescents’ mental health problems increase help-seeking
from all health-service providers [64]. In the Greek
health system general practitioners do not act as a filter
to specialized services and patients are not restricted to
consult directly the health professional of their choice.
As a result, medical doctors are usually the first professionals the patients seek, when in need. Less than one
in five adolescents experiencing depression consulted a
doctor during the last year due to their condition, while
only one in ten depressed adolescents with no comorbid
anxiety have seen a doctor. The finding is consistent with


previous studies from Europe and the United States
reporting that only a minority of adolescents with depression seeks professional help [20].

There are certain limitations of our study. The crosssectional nature of our study should be taken into
account when trying to interpret our results and draw
causal inferences. Moreover, our sample included only
pupils attending senior high schools (approximately
75 % of the school-attending adolescents of this age)
and not those attending other school types (for example
technical vocational schools). Additionally, in the present
study we have included adolescents from urban areas. Our
sample is not a typically representative sample of the
Greek population and many areas were conveniently
selected, however it represents a significant part of the
population of the country, since it includes important aspects of the observed intranational geographical, economical and cultural diversity (urban mainland, metropolitan
and island population). Furthermore, parental employment status was based on adolescents’ self-report, which
may result in some misclassification. However, this kind of
misclassification is expected to be random. Moreover,
the question about parental employment status did not
include information about the exact occupation and as
a result an official “occupational status” classification
was not possible.

Additionally, we have used a subjective socioeconomic
variable, namely adolescents’ self-reports on the financial
difficulties of their families. It has been suggested that
directly questioning adolescents about their family’s
income can be unreliable [31]. In the literature financial
difficulties of the family have been often used as a socioeconomic indicator in studies investigating socioeconomic
health inequalities in populations of children and adults

[23, 65]. These studies have shown that subjective indicators may be equally or even more important compared to
more objective indicators of socio-economic status [65].
Further, regarding the service utilization, help-seeking
can be only reported in retrospect, and symptoms of
depression only at present. As a result, help-seeking
may be reported for psychological problems in adolescents without current symptoms and vice versa.

Conclusions
During the last few years Greece is confronted with a
serious economic crisis. Our study has tried to investigate some important aspects of adolescent depression
in the country with data obtained just before the outbreak of the crisis. The present study reports a significant
burden of depression for Greek adolescents, even before
the crisis and its effects became evident, and suggests that
there is an important association between depressive
symptomatology and financial problems. Only a small
proportion of the adolescents experiencing depression


-----

have used professional help. It could be expected that a
socioeconomic crisis would further worsen the above picture. Further research, however, is needed to support this
argument, with the goal to make the best possible use and
distribution of available resources.
