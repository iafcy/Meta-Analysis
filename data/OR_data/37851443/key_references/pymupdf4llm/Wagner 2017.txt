**Abstract This is a nationwide epidemiological study using**
DSM-5 criteria to assess the prevalence of mental disorders in a large sample of Austrian adolescents between 10
and 18 years including hard-to-reach samples. A sample of
3615 adolescents from four cohorts (school grades 5, 7, 9,
11; age range 10–18 years) was recruited from 261 schools,
samples of unemployed adolescents (n 39) and adoles=
cents from mental health institutions (n 137) were added.

The Youth Self-Report and SCOFF were used to screen
for mental health problems. In a second phase, the Childrens’ Diagnostic Interview for Mental Disorders was used
to make point and lifetime psychiatric diagnoses. Mental
health service use was also assessed. Point prevalence and
lifetime prevalence rates for at least one psychiatric disorder were 23.9% and 35.8%. The highest lifetime prevalence
rates were found for anxiety disorders (15.6%), neurodevelopmental disorders (9.3%; ADHD 5.2%) and depressive

disorders (6.2%). Forty-seven percent of adolescents with
a lifetime psychiatric disorder had a second diagnosis.
Internalising disorders were more prevalent in girls, while
neurodevelopmental disorders and disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders were more prevalent in boys. Of
those with a lifetime psychiatric disorder, 47.5% had contacted mental health services. Of the residual 52.5% who
had not contacted mental health services, 18.1% expressed
an interest in treatment. DSM-5 mental health disorders are
highly prevalent among Austrian adolescents. Over 50%
had or were interested in accessing treatment. Early access
to effective interventions for these problems is needed to
reduce burden due to mental health disorders.

Epidemiology

### Introduction

Epidemiological studies are essential not only to provide
data on children and adolescents who are affected by mental health problems, but also to provide information on
the need, availability and access to mental health services.
Information about prevalence and incidence is useful for
planning primary, secondary and tertiary prevention and
treatment services [1].
A meta-analysis of population studies assessing the
prevalence of mental disorders in children and adolescents
found a worldwide pooled prevalence rate of 13.4% for
any mental disorder, surveys including epidemiological
studies from 1970 to 2000 found median prevalence rates
of 18%, and a US sample in 2010 revealed 20% of adolescents between 13 and 18 years with mental health problems
who need treatment [2–7]. The most frequent psychiatric

disorders in childhood and adolescence are anxiety disorders (up to 31.9%), behaviour disorders (16.3–19.1%),
substance use disorders (8.3–11.4%), emotional disorders (3.7–14.3%), hyperkinetic disorders (2.2–8.6%) and
aggressive dissocial disorders (2.1–7.6%) [2]. In childhood, mental health problems in general are more frequent
in boys than in girls (2:1), but from the age of 13 years
onward, the prevalence rates are higher for girls. However,
there are gender differences between various disorders. For
example, adolescent boys suffer more often from externalising and substance use disorders, while female adolescents
are more often affected by internalising disorders, such as
eating disorders and depressive disorders [3].
The severity and persistence of adolescent mental
health problems are also of relevance [8–11]. In the Dutch
TRAILS report, 22% out of 45% youth with a lifetime
mental health disorder showed severe impairment. Functional impairment can be assessed from disorder-specific
measures or a global measure such as the CGAS (Child
Global Assessment Scale) [12]. Although anxiety disorders
are most prevalent they are usually less severe, whereas
the less prevalent mood and behaviour disorders are more
severe [11]. The longitudinal BELLA study in Germany
revealed a high persistence rate of mental health problems
(>30% in a 6 year follow-up). Mental health service use
was limited to only 33% with acute or recurrent mental
health problems and 63.9% with persistent mental health
problems [13]. A similar pattern was identified in the Dutch
TRAILS cohort study with only 35% of adolescents with
problems accessing specialised mental health services,
increasing to 54.5% of those with multiple psychiatric disorders [10]. Of the 6–16 years old children and adolescents
who were treated in specialised mental health services in
Denmark, neurodevelopmental disorders and conduct disorders were the principal diagnostic group, especially in
male children and adolescents, while affective, eating, neurotic, stress-related and adjustment disorders were more
common in girls [8].
Several methodological issues are of relevance for the
conduct of epidemiological studies. Information from multiple sources produces a more complete picture of behaviour and functioning [14]. The combination of a population-based cohort with a clinical cohort has been strongly
recommended to examine continuities between the milder
and the more severe ends of pathology. Barkmann and
Schulte-Markwort (2004) suggest that additional quotas should be sampled from hard-to-reach groups such as
inhabitants of youth welfare institutions or the offspring of
migrants [15]. In Austria, there is compulsory education
for nine school years, typically until the age of 15 years.
According to surveys in the German-speaking area, about
5% are school refusers and 7.2% leave after 9 years [16].
These individuals who will not be captured from school

## 1 3


surveys might overlap with those in mental health institutions or from institutions providing courses for adolescents
not in education or employment.
The aim of our study was to determine the point and
lifetime prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders (applying DSM-5 criteria) in a national school sample of Austrian
adolescents aged between 10 and 18 years using a twostage design which also sampled hard-to-reach groups.

### Methods

**Study design**

The Mental Health in Austrian Teenagers (MHAT) study is
a two-stage cross-sectional epidemiological study assessing mental disorders in a population of Austrian teenagers
aged between 10 and 18 years. A random sample of adolescents from four age cohorts, grades 5, 7, 9 and 11 is drawn
from different types of schools in all nine federal states of
Austria (school sample). Additionally, adolescents not in
school (early school leavers or school absenteeism) were
also recruited through courses for unemployed youths and
through mental health service centres. The latter formed the
non-school sample.
A screening phase using questionnaires was followed by
a diagnostic interview conducted by telephone applying the
new criteria of the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5, [17]). All adolescents scoring above a pre-determined cut-off point were
recruited for detailed clinical interviews (“at-risk group”).
Additionally, 10% of the adolescents scoring below the cutoff point were selected randomly for the clinical interview
(“not at-risk group”). In addition to the adolescents, their
parents (either mother or father) were also asked to participate in a clinical interview. The MHAT study was conducted between 2013 and 2015.

**Sample size calculation**

A clustered prevalence sampling calculation based on Sullivan (2010) was used to obtain the required sample size for
the screening stage [18]. For the sample size calculation, a
prevalence of 20% of any psychiatric disorder in childhood
and adolescence is used as a conservative assumption. Furthermore, a cluster size of 60 per school grade was intended
and a design effect of 2 was assumed. The calculated sample size was N 502 per school grade (in total N 2008
= =
for all four included school grades). As we also intended to
calculate gender prevalence estimates without losing precision, the required sample size was doubled leading to a
total required sample size of _N_ 4016. According to the
=
national report on education, 7.2% of adolescents leave

school after the compulsory 9 years (grade 7 and above)

[16]. 4% of the sample of 11th graders were recruited from
training courses for early school leavers and unemployed
adolescents (N 40, n 20 per sex). There might be some
= =
overlap with the group of adolescents who cannot attend
a school due to severe mental health problems, children
and adolescents with a psychiatric disorder who are often
absent from school [19] approximate to 3% (N 128,
=
_n_ 16 per sex and school grade). Therefore, a sample of
=
these adolescents was recruited from mental health service
institutions (departments for child and adolescent psychiatry) in Austria.
A detailed description of sample size calculation is
being published elsewhere [20].

**Procedure**

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics Commission of the Medical University of Vienna (EK
1134/2013). A multidisciplinary commission of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education and Women’s Affairs
also approved the study. For the screening phase, all Austrian schools (N 2547) at lower and upper secondary
=
educational level for pupils in the age group between 10
and 18 years were contacted by e-mail and/or telephone
and invited to participate. Subsequently, a stratified random cluster sample was ascertained. School classes were
recruited as distinct clusters, from strata defined by school
type and federal state. Four school grades (5th, 7th, 9th
and 11th) were included in the sample. No more than a
maximum of two classes per school were selected. Individual exclusion criteria included low intellectual ability, low essential German language skills or attending a
special needs school. Written informed consent from the
adolescents and their legal representatives was obtained
by the class teachers. Teachers rated all participating and
non-participating students regarding school performance,
behavioural problems and social integration. Adolescents
completed the questionnaires during one school lesson
(50 min). An online form and an equivalent paper–pencil
form of the questionnaire were used (76.7% online). The
feasibility and acceptability of the screening phase procedure was evaluated in a pilot study [21].
For the sample of early school leavers, different course
providers for unemployed adolescents were selected randomly from a list of course providers and asked for participation. For the sample of mental health institutions,
eight departments for child and adolescent psychiatry (out
of 11) located in five federal states of Austria (in the following sections named as “clinical sample”) were selected
and patients were asked to participate. The same procedure
was applied as in the school sample with the difference that


the paper–pencil version of the screening questionnaire was
used only.
The flow of the entire recruitment process is depicted in
Fig. 1.

**Participants**

With regard to the school sample, we approached 7643
adolescents. According to the teachers’ records, no student had to be excluded due to low intellectual ability and
_n_ 12 had to be excluded due to low German language
=
skills. We received questionnaires from a total of 3615 adolescents which correspond to a participation rate of 47.3%.
One hundred and thirty-eight datasets had to be excluded
because of too many missing values to calculate the risk
status, leading to a final sample size of 3477 adolescents
(44.7% males, 55.3% females).
To detect potential differences between participating
and non-participating students, teachers rated all students
of their class on a few basic questions. Logistic regression
analyses were performed to predict participation (yes vs.
no). According to the teachers, students who did not participate were more often absent from schools (p 0.001), con=
centrated poorly (p 0.001), were less socially integrated
=
(p < 0.001), more socially withdrawn at school (p 0.050)
=
and had more behavioural problems (p 0.040). However,
=
effect sizes were all minimal to low (odds ratios 1.3–1.6).
In the sample of the unemployed adolescents and early
school leavers, _n_ 76 adolescents were approached and
=
data from 19 (48.7%) girls and 20 (51.3%) boys were
obtained, which is approximately the planned sample size.
In the clinical sample, n 292 patients aged 10–18 years
=
were approached, of whom 137 (30 boys, 21.9% and 107
girls, 78.1%) provided informed consent for participation
in the study.

**Screening (phase 1)**

At the screening phase, socio-demographic data, mental
health and potential risk factors affecting mental health
were assessed by questionnaires including the following:
Socio-demographic variables include age, sex, school
grade, school type, federal state, familial factors such as family structure (including single parent structure, stepparent in
household), chronic somatic or mental diseases of parents
and siblings, negative life events (death of close others, accident, traumatic experiences like physical and sexual abuse)
and potential social risk factors such as migration background or low socio-economic status (including parental
unemployment). The socio-economic status was assessed by
the Family Affluence Scale [22].
The German version of the widely used Youth SelfReport was used to obtain the general psychopathology

[23–25]. Behavioural and emotional problems were
assessed by 103 problem items on a three-point scale
(“0” absent, “1” sometimes true, “2” often
= = =
true). Items were summed up to eight syndrome scales
including Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, Anxious/
Depressed, Social Problems, Thought Problems, Attention Problems, Delinquent Behaviour and Aggressive
Behaviour, and three second-order scales (Total Problem
score, Internalising Problems, Externalising Problems).
Good internal consistencies were reported for the second-order scales (Cronbach alphas >0.86) and have been
identified for the syndrome scales Anxious/Depressed
and Aggressive Behaviour. They range between α 0.80
=
and α 0.86 for boys and girls. Internal consisten=
cies for Somatic Complaints, Delinquent Behaviour
and Attention Problems range between α 0.70 and
=
α 0.77 and are satisfactory. Consistencies lower than
=
α 0.70 have been found for Withdrawn, and Thought
=
Problems in boys and girls as well as Social Problems in
boys [25].
Raw scores were transformed into T-scores according
to existing German normative data.
As eating pathology is not covered in the Youth SelfReport, the SCOFF questionnaire [26] was used to assess
a potential risk for eating disorders. The SCOFF is an
acronym for the following five questions: Do you make
yourself Sick because you feel uncomfortably full? Do
you worry that you have lost Control over how much you
eat? Have you recently lost more than One stone (6 kg)
in a 3-month period? Do you believe yourself to be Fat
when others say you are too thin? Would you say that
Food dominates your life? The questions are answered on
a dichotomous scale (“yes” vs. “no”). Those five items
assess core features of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorders. One point is given for
every “yes” answer. A score of 2 reflects a risk for an
≥
ED. A pooled sensitivity of 0.80 and a pooled specificity
of 0.93 have been found in a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy of the SCOFF across several countries [27].
However, other disorders have not been included in the
screening as they are better assessed through parent rating instead of self-rating, such as autism spectrum disorder. Following the completion of the screening questionnaire, the adolescents were divided into two groups
(at-risk vs. not at-risk for mental disorders) according
to pre-determined cut-offs derived from the Youth SelfReport and the SCOFF. The at-risk group was defined
as reaching t-levels >70 in at least one of the eight YSR
syndrome scales or a SCOFF total score of 2, includ≥
ing either weight loss of at least 6 kg within 3 months
or intentional vomiting. All other adolescents who did
not fulfil those criteria were assigned to the group “not
at-risk”.


**Population at‑risk**

In the school sample, n 792 (22.8%) reached the cut-off
=
level, including _n_ 464 girls (24.1%) and _n_ 328 boys
= =
(21.2%) with 11 missing values in the variable sex and
_n_ 2685 (77.2%) ranged below cut-off. Within the sample

who scored over the cut-off level, _n_ 602 (76.0%) pro=
vided a telephone number and contact address for the telephone interview. We randomly selected n 301 (11.2%)

adolescents from the pool under the cut-off level; of those
_n_ 62 (20.6%) did not provide a telephone number. Of

those with contact address, in _n_ 323 cases, both one

cases only the adolescent and in n 84 cases only the par=
ent could be interviewed. In total, for n 461 cases at least
=
the adolescent’s or parent’s interview was available, leading to a total response rate of 54.8% of those who were
approached. Those students who were selected for the
interview but did not participate did not differ significantly
from students who participated with regard to the YSR total
score (mean 47.32 vs. 48.79; t 0.988, p 0.323). In

level. In this group n 21 (53.8%) did not provide contact

information and _n_ 13 (33.3%) were not approachable

for the interview or declined after initial consent. As from
the remaining five unemployed adolescents no prevalence
estimates are possible, we had to refrain from performing
detailed interviews. Of the cases in the clinical sample,
_n_ 115 (83.9%) provided contact information to approach
=
them for the interview.

**Structured interview (phase 2)**

All adolescents and respective parents selected for phase 2
underwent a structured clinical telephone interview (Childrens’ Diagnostic Interview for Mental Disorders; CDI-MD)

[28].
The Childrens’ Diagnostic Interview for Mental Disorders (CDI-MD) is a structured clinical interview for children and adolescents aged from 6 to 18 years and their
parents for assessing a broad range of psychiatric disorders. It comprises an interview guide for children and
one for parents. The current published CDI-MD version
for the diagnostics of psychiatric disorders according to
the classification of DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 has been
adapted for the classification of DSM-5 by the authors of
the CDI-MD. Point prevalence and lifetime prevalence
rates were assessed for the following disorders:
Neurodevelopmental disorders [attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), tic disorders], depressive disorders (disruptive mood dysregulation disorder,
major depressive disorder), anxiety disorders (separation

## 1 3


-----

anxiety disorder, selective mutism, specific phobia, social
anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder), obsessive–compulsive disorder,
posttraumatic stress disorder, feeding and eating disorders (pica, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder), elimination disorders (enuresis, encopresis), disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorders
(oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorders). Listed
under the section “Conditions for further study” in the
DSM-5, suicidal behaviour disorder and non-suicidal
self-injury can also be diagnosed by means of the CDIMD. Screening questions for alcohol-, tobacco- and other
substance-related disorders as well as for the schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders are included.
The interview guides for assessing disrupted mood dysregulation disorder, suicidal behaviour disorder and nonsuicidal self-injury have been included in the CDI-MD by
Schneider and colleagues for the first time. Additionally,
we have developed interview guides for the assessment of
Internet gaming disorder (also in the “Conditions for further study”) as well as for avoidant/restrictive food intake
disorder and rumination disorders.
The interrater reliability (kappa coefficient) ranged
between 0.67 and 0.90 for the classes of lifetime diagnoses included in the children version and between 0.85 and
0.94 in the parent version [28]. Content validity can be
derived from the classification scheme of the DSM-5. It is
a widely used and well-accepted instrument for the assessment of mental disorders in children and adolescents.
The progression of the questions is syndrome oriented
with skipping rules if the first two starting questions are
not applicable. The prevalence of full-syndrome disorders
will be presented in this paper. Full syndrome means that
all diagnostic criteria of a psychiatric diagnosis were met,
including subjective impairment. In the CDI-MD, impairment is judged by the interviewer on a four-point Likert
scale from 0 not at all to 3 very strong and has to be
= =
at least 2 ( strong impairment) to be rated as clinical case.
=
Constraint in four social areas (at home, at school or work,
at leisure time, with friends) and personal suffering of the
adolescent are considered. Evaluation as impairment is
dependent on the individual diagnosis and follows the rules
of DSM-5. If one diagnostic criterion was not reached but
there was a significant impairment, a diagnosis within the
category “other specified disorder” was assigned.
Furthermore, there are sections on the family history
of mental disorders, as well as axis IV (psychosocial and
environmental problems) and axis V (Global Assessment
Functioning scale, ranging from 1 to 100). We chose to use
the GAF score from DSM-IV representing the judgement

## 1 3


of the individual’s overall level of functioning ranging from
1 to 100 (indicating the lowest 1 to the highest 100 levels
of functioning) rather than WHO Disability Assessment
Schedule (WHODAS) which has replaced it in DSM-5, to
get the clinician’s judgement.
Interviewers were eight psychologists trained in clinical
and health psychology, and one medical doctor in training
for child and adolescent psychiatry. All interviewers completed a standardized training given by GW. Cases were
discussed in regular supervision group meetings led by GW
and KW to ensure a consistent approach across all interviewers. Each uncertain diagnosis was discussed intensively and a diagnosis was confirmed only when there was
consensus.
For the present study, the interview sections were
divided between adolescents and parents. Internalising
disorders were assessed in the adolescents’ interview, and
externalising disorders as well as disorders primarily occurring in infancy and early childhood were assessed in the
parents’ interview. This decision was based on economic
reasons and previous results which showed that externalising disorders can be observed and better judged by parents,
whereas internalising disorders such as anxiety and depressive disorders cannot be identified well externally and are
therefore better judged by the adolescents (see also [28]).
Mental health service use was assessed by the end of each
interview section by asking if any health service was used
with regard to the reported problem and, if so, in what form
(i.e. psychotherapy, psychological treatment, outpatient/
inpatient treatment in a psychiatric clinic). Furthermore,
the participants were asked if they had to take any medications due to the reported problem.

**Statistical analyses**

Analyses were conducted using IBM Statistics 22.0 software and Microsoft Excel 2010. Data from the screening
stage (including calculation of the risk status) were only
analysed if there were no more than eight missing values
in the YSR and no missing value in the SCOFF, which
is in line with the manuals. The prevalence estimates of
the psychiatric disorders obtained in the interview stage
were derived as follows: for the school sample, prevalence estimates were calculated applying the law of total
probability meaning that the prevalence estimates within
the “at-risk” sample and within the “not at-risk” sample
were pooled by weighting them with the probability for
being at risk, respectively, and not at-risk. Prevalence
estimates are provided separately for the “at-risk” and
“not at-risk” group in a supplement table. Standard errors


-----

and confidence intervals were based on a simple random
sampling. As there was a very high number of clusters
(345 school classes) in combination with a low number of
individuals within one cluster, standard errors calculated
based on cluster sampling were quite the same as standard errors calculated based on a simple random sampling
(design effect ~1).
The prevalence estimates in the clinical sample were calculated by the number of patients with a specific diagnosis
divided by the total number of clinical patients who participated in the interview stage. As described below in more
detail, the prevalence estimates within the sample of unemployed adolescents could not have been calculated due to
the high dropout from the screening to the interview stage.
Finally, the prevalence estimates from the school and
clinical sample were pooled to obtain a “total prevalence”
that takes into account that a certain proportion of adolescents could not be reached via the school setting due
to severe mental health problems. The school and clinical
sample were weighted in accordance with the original sample plan. Detailed information on the calculations of the
prevalence estimates can be requested from the corresponding authors.
The prevalence estimates for different psychiatric diagnoses are based on different numbers of cases. For the
diagnoses that were assessed through the adolescent’s
interview, prevalence estimates are based on all available
adolescents’ interviews regardless of whether the parent’s interview was available or not. For the diagnoses
that were assessed through the parents’ interview, prevalence estimates are based on all available parents’ interviews regardless of whether the adolescent’s interview
was available or not. For calculating the prevalence of
groups of psychiatric disorders (e.g. anxiety disorders)
and the prevalence of any psychiatric disorder, all cases
where both the adolescent’s and the parent’s interview
were available were included. For all assessed diagnoses,
the point prevalence and lifetime prevalence were calculated. The same procedure was applied separately to girls
and boys to obtain gender-specific prevalence estimates.
Furthermore, comorbidities between groups of psychiatric disorders were calculated. Only cases where both the
adolescent’s and parent’s interview were available were
included. Socio-demographic differences between students with and without a full-syndrome psychiatric diagnosis and the clinical sample were analysed by means of
ANOVAs in case of metric variables and χ[2]-tests in case
of frequency variables. All factors that turned out as significant in the univariate analyses were further included
in a multinomial logistic regression analysis to find out
which factors still reach statistical significance when they
are mutually adjusted for.


### Results

**Point and lifetime prevalence rates of psychiatric**
**disorders in school, clinical sample and total sample**

The point and lifetime prevalence rates of any psychiatric disorder in the school sample were 21.89% ( 4.5)
±
and 34.09% ( 5.2). When correcting these estimates
±
with participants from the departments of child and
adolescent psychiatry, the point and lifetime prevalence
rates increased to 23.93% ( 4.2) and 35.82% ( 4.8),
± ±
respectively. The figures for each diagnosis are shown in
Table 1. As expected, we found large discrepancies in the
lifetime prevalence rates between the sample currently in
psychiatric inpatient treatment and the school sample for
depressive disorders, eating disorders, anxiety disorders,
non-suicidal self-injury and trauma- and stress-related
disorders.

**Gender differences**

Overall, there were no gender differences for the total
number of lifetime diagnoses (34.41% for females
and 37.95% for males, see also Table 2). However,
between diagnostic groups there were some differences; for example within the group of neurodevelopmental disorders, ADHD was three times as high in
boys than in girls (15.4 and 5.2%, respectively) and
disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders were
six times higher in boys than in girls (7.44 and 1.26%,
respectively). In contrast, lifetime prevalence rates of
some internalising disorders were higher in girls than
in boys: anxiety disorders were twice as high in girls
than in boys (19.53 and 9.52%, respectively), traumaand stressor-related disorders were almost four times
as high in girls than in boys (4.94 and 1.30%, respectively), and feeding and eating disorders were eight
times higher in girls than in boys (5.47 vs. 0.64%,
respectively). Within the category “Conditions for further studies (appendix B)”, no girls were found to fulfil
the criteria for Internet gaming disorder, while 2.01%
of the boys fulfilled the criteria. Suicidal behaviour disorder was prevalent in 2.53% of the girls and 0.33% of
the boys, and non-suicidal self-injury in 3.49% of the
girls and absent in the boys, reflecting the internalising
character of the disorders.

**Comorbidities**

Over 40% of individuals within each diagnostic category
met the criteria for another diagnostic category during

for further studies”. Depression and anxiety disorders
were present in 87.5% and 68.8% of cases with suicidal
behaviour disorder. Depression, anxiety disorders and
suicidal behaviour disorder were prevalent in 84%, 60%
and 44% of cases with non-suicidal self-injury. Lifetime comorbidities of all mental disorders are listed in
Table 3.


**Socio‑demographic, clinical and risk differences**
**between healthy adolescents and adolescents**
**with mental disorders in the school and clinical sample**

Significant group differences were found for adolescents
without lifetime mental health problems and the clinical sample with respect to sex, age, family status, chronic
physical or mental illness within the family, and the history
of a traumatic life event (see Table 4). The clinical sample
showed a higher percentage of female patients compared
to students without a full-syndrome psychiatric disorder,
who were older, lived more often with a single parent, had
a higher percentage of chronic physical illness and mental

The school sample and clinical sample differed with
respect to global functioning with higher functioning

non-suicidal self-injury and 82.3 for feeding and eating disorders. In the clinical sample, mean GAF scores
ranged from 47.5 for neurodevelopmental disorders to

In the school sample, 34.09% of the students fulfilled
the diagnostic criteria for any lifetime psychiatric disorder. Within this group, 47.5% had received treatment,
8.0% with inpatient treatment and 57.3% received outpatient treatment in mental health service, psychotherapeutic or clinical-psychological treatment, and 13.9%
received medication. Of the group without treatment,

18.1% expressed an interest in treatment. Mental health
care utilization for each diagnostic group is listed in
Table 6. Service use differs between diagnostic groups,
with highest health care utilization in externalising mental health problems, including neurodevelopmental disorders (63.4%) and elimination disorders (44.4%). For
internalising disorders, lower mental health care use was
detected, i.e. 27.3% in anxiety disorders, 18.8% in eating
disorders, 16.7% in suicidal behaviour disorders and 10%
in non-suicidal self-injury.

### Discussion

This is an epidemiological study of mental disorders applying DSM-5 criteria in adolescents aged between 10 and
18 years. We assessed almost 4000 adolescents for mental health problems, functional impairment and treatment
seeking and included hard-to-reach groups. We used a twostage design as it is more time efficient and can obtain samples from a broad base. The second stage, using structured
clinical interview is intended to overcome limitations of
exclusively using screening instruments [29].
We found an overall point prevalence of 21.89% of
mental disorders in adolescent students aged 10–18 years
(23.93% when correcting for a sample which cannot be
reached via schools). Anxiety disorders (9.52%) were the
most common followed by neurodevelopmental disorders.
These prevalence rates are comparable to those found in

a US nationwide epidemiological study for mental health
problems in adolescents, applying DSM-IV criteria where a
30 day prevalence rate of 23.4% for any disorder and 4.5%
for ADHD was found. However, the rates for anxiety disorders (14.9% vs. 11.01%), mood disorders (3.1% vs. 1.36%)
and oppositional and conduct disorders (4.4% compared to
1.91%) were higher in the US sample [30].
A meta-analysis of 41 studies published between 1985
and 2012 from 27 countries concluded that the worldwide
prevalence of any mental disorder in children and adolescents was 13.4%. However, the conclusion from the
meta-regression analyses was that these pooled prevalence estimates are likely to be an underestimate. Prevalence estimates are influenced by the representativeness
of the sample, the sample frame and the diagnostic interview used and may also differ by area and timing [12].
Another cause for higher prevalence rates in our study
might be lower diagnostic requirements for some diagnoses and the incorporation of new disorders in DSM-5
compared to DSM-IV. This increase in prevalence is seen
in eating disorders (3.7% vs. 1.8%) [31].
Within the category “Condition for further study” we
have found lower point and lifetime prevalence rates for
suicidal behaviour disorder than in German-based studies (where point and lifetime prevalence rates of suicide
attempts of 1.9% and 4.1% for adolescents between 13
and 18 years were reported) [32]. Comorbidities between
psychiatric disorders were common. This may be an artefact caused by the current system of classification. These
empirical findings can be used to answer some of the criticisms made against DSM-5 [33]. For example, it is questionable whether non-suicidal self-injury is a stand-alone
entity as it is often present in the context of depressive and
anxiety disorders, borderline personality or posttraumatic
stress. The same argument applies to suicidal behaviour
disorder.
The differential diagnostic pattern found between genders is in line with other surveys [2, 30]. The clinical
sample included a higher percentage of older female adolescents who were living with a single parent or patchwork household. The clinical group also had more chronic
somatic or mental illnesses in family members (parent/
sibling) and had experienced more often a severe life event
such as abuse or violence. However, migration background,
socioeconomic or parental employment status did not differ
from adolescents without a full-syndrome diagnosis. This
is in line with Rescorla et al. (2007) who found no association between YSR-scores with ethnicity, religion or geography in a worldwide survey of 24 countries [34, 35].
Single-wave, cross-sectional studies such as this are
likely to underestimate the burden of disease in the general population. While around 13.3% children on average
show a psychiatric diagnosis at any measurement point,


almost three times this number had one or more disorders
in multiple wave designs [36]. This and the fact that most
mental health problems start early in life (50% before the
age of 15 years and 75% before the age of 18 years) and
tend to persist suggests that early interventions may be of
value [37].
In our school sample, 47.5% of adolescents had
engaged in treatment. This is a higher treatment rate
compared with the rate of 20–25% service use by young
people with mental health problems reported for the
USA and European countries [38, 39]. The numbers are
comparable to the study of Merikangas who found fewer
than half of youth with current mental disorders receiving treatment within the mental health service and that
health service use differed a lot between diagnoses with
highest treatment use for neurodevelopmental disorders
and lowest for internalising disorders [40]. Comorbidity
and severe impairment were associated with service utilisation, especially in behaviour disorders. This is in line
with a recent study of mental health care use in Germany
(longitudinal BELLA study) and in the Netherlands,
showing the highest treatment rates within specialist centres for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders [10, 41].
However, in the Netherlands in younger children, only
50% of clinically referred cases met the requirement of
severe impairment. It has been discussed that many children with psychiatric symptoms and mild impairment
seeking mental health care will be undiagnosed and
might therefore not be treated [42]. Low service use was
found for mental health problems with high egosyntonicity such as eating disorders. Our findings with treatment
rates of 25% are in line with the first epidemiologic study
for eating disorders in the UK applying DSM-5 criteria,
where service use of 27.9% was found [43]. In contrast,
the most recent data of the National Survey on Drug Use
and Health reported depression as the most frequent mental health problem for receiving mental health services
(56.5%) in adolescents, whereas in our sample only 36%
received treatment [44].
There are several barriers to seeking treatment. The first
is related to parental factors such as their recognition of
the problem as an entity that can possibly be treated and
the resource (time and financial resources) involved in
seeking treatment [45]. Second, only a few children and
adolescents meeting symptom criteria are diagnosed by
health professionals [46]. Third, there is an enormous discrepancy between needs and resource availability [47]. For
Austria, a shortage of inpatient, outpatient and day patient
facilities by around 50% of mental health care needed and
a shortage of specialists (child and adolescent psychiatrists) have been reported [48]. In 2012, there was only
one child and adolescent psychiatrist available for 30,000
children and adolescents with massive regional variation.

Fourth, egosyntonicity and stigma are further factors that
have an impact on treatment seeking [10].
A continuum of different treatment levels, from primary
to tertiary prevention, from the community to specialist
health services has been proposed, and appropriate interventions should be widely available to speed initial treatment contact [49, 50]. Milder but potentially serious mental
disorders might respond to measures such as psychosocial
support, self-help programs and non-clinical settings in an
early stage [51]. Such interventions could be developed in
youth-friendly ways and disseminated through communitybased channels such as educational settings in schools and
be provided by Internet platforms or smart-phone applications [52]. Specialised and multidisciplinary care will be
required for young people with multiple or complex needs.
The tertiary system has an important part to play in the care
of young people with serious mental disorders and must
be strengthened. It has been stated that especially inpatient
facilities are needed for young people so that they are no
longer placed in adult inpatient units for mental disorders

[53].

**Strengths and limitations**

This study has several strengths. We did not only include
a school sample, but also hard-to-reach groups such as
unemployed adolescents and those hospitalized in child
and adolescent departments of psychiatry. The importance
of including these subgroups is supported by the fact that
a higher percentage of this subgroup scored within the
clinical range in the screening phase. However, the population of adolescents between 10 and 18 years also includes
youths who have not been approached in our survey, such
as youths who do not speak German (minor refugees,
migrants), who are intellectually impaired or chronically ill
and are known to have an elevated risk for mental health
problems.
Second, we included a broad range (n 27) of mental
=
health problems. We assessed point and lifetime prevalence
rates, sex differences in mental health problems, comorbidities, general functioning, treatment rates and request for
treatment. For higher diagnostic accuracy, we used in-depth
interviews performed by experts (graduated psychologists
in clinical training and under permanent supervision of
experienced clinicians) instead of disease-specific self-rating questionnaires.
We illustrated the gap between the prevalence of mental health problems, availability of treatment facilities and
request for treatment.
Nevertheless, some limitations should be noted. Of all
schools (n 2547) contacted in Austria, only _n_ 428

(22.3%) declined in the subsequent stage. The response
rate in the screening stage was low (47.3%) and another
57.8% dropped out in the interview stage. Non-response
in the screening stage was primarily caused by the fact
that many students did not bring the informed consent
form signed by the parents to school and were therefore not allowed to participate. Data protection discussions that took place in the media just at the time of the
data collection might also have influenced participation
rates. To evaluate a possible response bias, teachers were
asked to rate all students of their class (participating and
not participating) regarding a few basic items. According to the teachers, students who did not participate in
the screening stage were significantly more often absent
from school, had lower ability to concentrate during
lessons, were less likely to be well integrated in class,
were more socially withdrawn in school and had more
behavioural problems than students participating in the
study. Although these differences reached statistical significance, the effect sizes were minimal to low. However,
this might suggest that the real prevalence rates were
higher. Despite great efforts made by the interviewers (at
least three contact attempts, mailbox messages, text messages), a significant proportion of adolescents and parents could not have been reached for the telephone interview. Those students who participated in the interview
did not significantly differ from students who could not
be reached for or declined participation in the interview
regarding the YSR total score, indicating that there was
no selective bias in the interview stage.
However, due the low response and high dropout rate
and due to the differences in the screening phase, the
obtained prevalence estimates might most likely be lower
than the real prevalence rates.
The use of information from multiple sources has been
considered as important for obtaining a complete picture of
behaviour and functioning of adolescents in epidemiologic
mental health studies and reducing mono-informant information bias [11, 14]. Adolescents, parents, teachers and
peers observe different aspects of behaviour and functioning
and help to better understand mental health of adolescents.
However, limited financial resources compel researchers
to reduce the use of information sources. In our survey,
we used three types of informants: Adolescents, their parents and teachers. Moreover, instead of obtaining information from different informants on the same problem, we
received information from different informants about different problems: We applied the teacher’s judgment in the
screening phase to rate non-participating adolescents. In
stage 1, we applied self-rating questionnaires, in stage 2, we
had interviewed only the adolescents for internalising problems and only parents for externalising disorders, although


-----

it has been commonly recommended to use both sources of
information. So we might have lost important information
and therefore could not profit from multi-informant data for
comparing, contrasting and combining results obtained from
different informants. This procedure might have limited the
validity of the obtained diagnosis. When comparing prevalence figures across disorder and interpreting comorbidities,
the fact that different information sources were used for different types of disorders should be taken into account.
Lifetime diagnoses were given retrospectively to capture
mental health problems present at an earlier age. Recall
bias might influence these results. Problems prevalent earlier in life might be difficult to recall for both adolescents
and parents and therefore be underestimated. Additionally,
transition between different diagnoses could have occured
and current problems overlap previous mental health
disorders.
In conclusion, this first broad nationwide and DSM-5
based study revealed a high prevalence of mental health
problems in youths and low attrition to treatment despite
suffering. Thus, more efforts are needed to recognize these
disorders and close the gap between needs and resources
for this highly vulnerable group of young people with mental health problems.
