**_Objective: This study examined patterns of mental health service use_**
**among depressed children and adolescents and factors associated with**
**help seeking and treatment modalities. Methods: The sample consist-**
**ed of 206 children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years who were as-**
**sessed as part of a larger survey of mental health service use in five**
**service systems and in the community and who met DSM-III-R criteria**
**for depressive disorders (major depression or dysthymia).** **_Results:_**
**Among the 206 children, 75 (36 percent) never received professional**
**help for depressive symptoms. Among the 131 children who received**
**professional help for depression, antidepressants were prescribed for**
**40 (31 percent) in the year before the interview. The findings indicate**
**possible undertreatment of depression among children and adoles-**
**cents, especially among African Americans. Socioeconomic factors,**
**such as the mother’s education and the child’s health insurance, were**
**not associated with receiving professional help for depressive symp-**
**toms but were associated with receiving antidepressants. Parental per-**
**ception of a child’s mental health service need was associated with re-**
**ceiving professional help but not with receiving antidepressants. Also,**
**depressed children were more likely to receive antidepressants when**
**they had life-threatening or severe symptoms, such as a suicide at-**
**tempt or drug abuse.** **_Conclusions: Whether a depressed child receives_**
**mental health services and the types of treatment received are influ-**
**enced by different individual and family factors and by the type of**
**symptoms exhibited. Better understanding of these factors will help in**
**meeting the service needs of depressed children and adolescents.**

ational studies have indicated
increasing rates of depression
and a shift to a younger age of

# Nonset (1–4). Depression is one of the

leading risk factors for suicide among
children and adolescents (5,6).
The Epidemiologic Catchment
Area study (7) found that about onethird of adults who suffered from a
major depressive disorder had not
sought treatment. In a review of studies of adult depression, Hirshfeld and
associates (8) found serious undertreatment of persons with depression,
even though effective treatments
have been available for several
decades. They concluded that patient-associated reasons for undertreatment include failure to recognize
symptoms, limited access to services,
lack of insurance, fear of being stigmatized, and noncompliance with
treatment. A further conclusion was
that inadequate training of health
care providers and barriers created by
mental health care delivery systems
also contribute to undertreatment.
The cost to individuals, families, and
society of undertreatment is substantial (8–10).
The situation of children who need
mental health services is no different
from that of adults: many children receive inappropriate services (11) or
no services at all (12–14). Children

ders (15–17).
Individual characteristics found to
affect child mental health service utilization include the child’s age (18–
20), gender (18,20–22), ethnicity (19–
21,23), physical illness (24), and level
of functioning (17,25,26). Family
characteristics include socioeconomic
status (19,22,24) and the parents’ use
of mental health services (22), their
perception of the child’s need for
mental health services and whether
the need was met (17), and their perceived burden (27). All these factors,
with the exception of perceived
parental burden, were taken into account in this study.
Most studies of child and adolescent mental health service need and
service use have not examined the association between service use and
specific psychiatric disorders. Little
is known about the factors that affect
mental health service use for depression or the types of treatment received by children with depression.
In this context, our study addressed
three questions: What are the factors
associated with receiving professional help for childhood depression?
What are the factors associated with
receiving antidepressants for depression? Are there shared and unique
factors associated with receiving professional help and receiving antidepressants?

#### Methods
_Sample and data_
Our analysis used data from a group
of 206 children and adolescents aged
9 to 17 years who met DSM-III-R criteria for depressive disorders (major
depression or dysthymic disorder).
This group is a subsample of a survey
of mental health service need and
service utilization among children
and adolescents from nonresidential
child service systems and the community in Westchester County, New
York (28). The group comprises all
the subjects in the Westchester study
who met criteria for depressive disorders.
The Westchester study included
763 children and adolescents randomly selected from five child service systems: mental health substance

ed 533 children and adolescents recruited from the community, including 360 children from the Westchester site of the Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent
Mental Disorders (MECA) study by
the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH) (29–32), selected
from the same sampling frame and
assessed with identical measures of
child psychopathology, impairment,
and service use.
The child and one parent or
guardian in each household were interviewed for approximately three

hours by trained interviewers about
childhood psychopathology, mental
health service use, and a wide array
of risk factors (29,32).

_Measures of psychopathology_
_and impairment_
**Depression and other mental dis-**
**orders. Children’s depression and**
other mental disorders in the six
months preceding the interview were
assessed by the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC)
(DSM-III-R) or DISC 2.3 (30). The
validity and reliability of the measures
have been reported elsewhere


p p
by either the parent or the child (30).
Depressive disorders included major
depression and dysthymia. The number of depressive symptoms was also
included in the analysis as an indicator of severity. Other mental disorders included anxiety disorders, disruptive disorders, and substance use
disorders.
**Impairment.** Impairment was
measured by the Child Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). The CGAS
scores range from 1 to 100, with a
lower score representing greater impairment. The interviewer’s rating,
based on the parent interview with
satisfactory validity, was used (25).

_Service use and perceived need_
**Child mental health service use**
**for depression. Specific questions**
about service use for depression, including treatment and medications
received, were asked for children
who met the NIMH-DISC criteria
for depression (30). As with the DISC
diagnoses, treatment information
from the parent and the child was aggregated. In addition, in the nonDISC service use section, the parent
and child were asked about the child’s
treatments and medications for emotional, behavioral, and drug problems. We used two variables in our
analysis: whether the child had ever
been seen by a health professional—
psychiatrist, psychologist, physician,
social worker, or guidance counselor
—for depressive symptoms, and
whether the child used an antidepressant in the previous year.
**Parental perception of a child’s**
**service needs and unmet needs.**
Parents were asked if they believed
their children needed any mental
health service (perceived need) and
whether any had been received. A
perception of unmet need was
recorded if a parent reported that a
child’s need for services was not met.
This measure is imprecise, however,
because a child could have been receiving services but the parent may
still have believed that the need had
not been met.
**Maternal mental health service**
**use. We used two variables in the**
parent interview: whether the bio

psychological or emotional problem,
and whether the biological mother
ever took any medication for a psychological or emotional problem.

_Sociodemographic factors_
Data on each child’s gender, age, race
or ethnicity, household income, maternal education, and health insurance status were used in the analyses.
Health insurance status was classified
as no insurance, Medicaid, or private
insurance (which included all nonMedicaid health insurance).

#### Analysis
We were mainly interested in two binary dependent variables: whether
the depressed children had received
professional help for depression, and
whether those who received professional help received antidepressants.
A univariate analysis was first conducted to compare sociodemographic
characteristics, other psychiatric disorders, and other factors of depressed
children who received professional
help with those who never received
any professional help for depression.
Among those who received professional help, univariate analysis was
used to compare those who received
antidepressants with those who did
not. A chi square test was used for
categorical variables, and a t test was
used for continuous variables.
Multiple logistic regression analysis
was used to identify factors that affected mental health service use for
depression among all depressed children. For those who received help,
the same method was used to identify
the factors differentiating those who
were taking antidepressants from
those who were not.
The two dependent variables—receipt of professional help and receipt
of antidepressants—correspond to
the two dichotomies of the service
use hierarchy; the comparison for antidepressant treatment was nested
within the comparison for getting
professional help. Therefore, in the
last stage of our analysis, we used a
nested response model (33) to examine whether the factors affecting receipt of professional help for depression were the same as those affecting

#### Results
_Sample description_
Of the 206 depressed children and
adolescents, 116 (56 percent) were
girls, 82 (40 percent) were white, 71
(35 percent) were African American,
38 (18 percent) were Hispanic, and
15 (7 percent) were other. The mean
age±SD was 14.4±2.3 years. Thirtynine children in the community sam

ple (7.3 percent) and 167 children in
the child service systems sample (21.9
percent) were depressed.
Comparisons of demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics of depressed children from the community with those from the service systems
show that depressed children from
the service systems were more likely
to be boys, to be ethnic minorities, to
be from disadvantaged families with a
low income, and to be on Medicaid
(data not shown). These notable differences between the children from
the community and those from service systems were anticipated In the

community—was included to control
for differences in the community and
service systems samples.

_Univariate analyses_
Of the 206 depressed children, 131
(64 percent) received professional
help; 75 (36 percent) did not seek
professional help for depressive
symptoms. Table 1 shows the family
and individual characteristics of depressed children who received professional help compared with those
who did not. African-American
youth were less likely to receive professional help than those from other
ethnic groups. As expected, depressed children who received professional help were more likely to
have a greater number of depressive
symptoms and more impairment
than those who did not receive such
help. Mothers of depressed children
who received professional help reported greater use of mental health
services and medication for their
own psychiatric problems and were
more likely to think that their children needed mental health services
than mothers of depressed children
who did not receive help.
Among the 131 children who received professional help, antidepressants were prescribed for 40 (31 percent) in the year before the interview. As Table 1 shows, children who
received antidepressants were significantly more likely than children who
did not to be white, to have a mother who had received professional
help and antidepressants, and to be
more impaired. Families of children
who received antidepressants also
had a higher average income and a
higher level of maternal education
and were more likely to have private
insurance. Children who received
antidepressants were also more likely to meet criteria for substance
abuse disorders and to have recently
attempted suicide.

sociated with receiving antidepressants included being male, a higher
level of maternal education, comorbid substance use disorders, a recent
suicide attempt, and greater impairment. Children from families with
private health insurance tended to receive antidepressants more often
than those from families with no insurance.
As discussed above, we were interested in identifying factors that affected whether children received
professional help for depression and
that influenced whether antidepressant medication was prescribed for
those who received help. In addition,
we wanted to identify shared and
unique factors associated with receiving professional help and antidepressants. Because the comparison of
children who received antidepressants was nested within the comparison of children who received professional help the model of nested re

sponses (33) was applied to the data.
We identified four factors with differential impact on the receipt of professional help for childhood depression compared with the use of antidepressants among those receiving professional help. Girls were more likely
to receive professional help for depression; however, among all those
who received help, boys were more
likely to receive antidepressants
(p<.01). Also, the mother’s education
and the child’s comorbid substance
use disorders and previous suicide attempt were significantly related to
antidepressant treatment (p<.05) but
not to receiving professional help for
depression.

#### Discussion and conclusions
Most studies of child mental health
service use have not examined service
use in terms of a specific disorder.
The study reported here assessed
child mental health service use for


depression and compared factors affecting the use of professional help
and treatment with antidepressants
for childhood depression.
Consistent with findings of studies
of adults (7,8), depression appears to
be undertreated among children and
adolescents, especially among African
Americans (21,35,36). However, it
has been suggested that AfricanAmerican youth more frequently seek
help for psychological symptoms
from nonprofessional domains such
as church and family before seeking
formal mental health services than do
whites (37). Further research in this
area is needed.
After the analysis controlled for
other possible confounding factors,
depressed girls appeared to be somewhat more likely to receive professional help for depression than boys.
This gender difference is consistent
with that found among adults (38,39).
However among children who re

-----

y y
antidepressants. These findings suggest that the gender effect may differ
by types of service and treatment.
More studies are needed to replicate
these findings.
Family socioeconomic characteristics did not appear to be significant
factors in whether children received
professional help, but they did play an
important role in whether antidepressants were prescribed. Children who
received antidepressants were more
likely to come from families of higher
socioeconomic status. Although the
association with income disappeared
in the multivariate analyses, the
mother’s education remained a significant predictor, suggesting that parental knowledge of depression and
of available medications for treatment may influence the type of services received.
Like other studies (40,41), our findings did not show a correlation between having insurance and receiving
professional help for depression.
However, among children receiving
such help, those with private insurance tended to be somewhat more
likely to receive antidepressants than
those with no insurance. These findings suggest that studies examining
mental health service use without simultaneously exploring the type of
treatment received may not reveal—
and may consequently underestimate—the impact of having health
insurance. The impact of insurance
on different types of treatment for
depression and possibly other disorders should be explored.
Consistent with previous studies
(26,40), our results indicate that level
of impairment and severity of depression (number of depressive symptoms) were related to receiving mental health services. The occurrence of
other disorders did not appear to be
related to a child’s receiving professional help for depression. However,
among children who received such
help, those who received antidepressants were more likely to have a comorbid substance use disorder and
to have had a previous suicide attempt. This finding is consistent with
previous studies (1) and suggests
that children with depression are


y
ing or severe symptoms, such as a
suicide attempt and drug abuse.
In summary, our findings suggest
that parental failure to recognize depressive symptoms, lack of knowledge about depression and its related
treatment, and lack of adequate health
insurance may all influence whether
or not a child receives services as well
as the type of treatment received.
Mental health education should be
offered to parents to improve early
identification and treatment of depressed children and adolescents.
A limitation of this study is that the
information on treatment for depression was limited, as we did not have a
measure of psychotherapy. Consequently, the children who did not receive antidepressant treatment could
have received anything from a single
evaluation to a full range of treatment
without antidepressants. It is also
possible that some depressed children who received antidepressants
had previously received another type
of treatment. Therefore, we do not
mean to imply that children who received antidepressants got better
service than those who did not.
In fact, the literature indicates that
although both psychotherapy and
pharmacotherapy have been found to
be beneficial for depressive disorders,
children do not seem to respond to
antidepressants as well as adults do
(1,42–45). Psychotherapy has been
recommended as the first treatment
for most depressed youth, with antidepressants considered only for those
with more severe depression, bipolar
disorder, and depression with psychotic features and those who do not
respond to psychotherapeutic intervention (1). Future research, including detailed treatment information, is
needed.
Finally, because of the low prevalence of depression, data from our
community and service systems samples were combined to increase the
power of the analysis. Although sample differences were statistically controlled and detailed analyses were
conducted to ensure that our findings
were not due to sample differences, a
large-scale study is needed to replicate these findings o
