ABSTRACT

Objective: To examine the relationship of depressive and disruptive disorders with patterns of mental health services util-

ization in a community sample of child ren and adolescents. Method: Data were from the NIMH Methods for the

Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA) Study.The sample consisted of 1,285 child (ages 9-17

years) and parenVguardian pairs. Data included child psychopatho logy (assessed by the Diagnostic Interview Schedule

for Children), impairment, child need and use of mental health services, and family socioeconomic status. Results: After

adjusting for potential confounding factors, disruptive disorder was significantly associated with children's use of mental

health services , but depressive disorder was nol. For school-based services , no difference was found between the 2 types

of disorders. Parents perceived greater need for mental health services for children with disruptive disorders than for those

with depression. Conversely, depression was more related to children's perception of mental health service need than was

disruptive disorder. Conclusions: The findings highlight the need for more effective ways to identify and refer depressed

children to mental health professionals, the importa nce of lrnprovinq school-based services to meet children's needs, and

the necessity to better educate parents and teachers regarding the identification of psychiatric disorders, especially
