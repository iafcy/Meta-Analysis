# Treatment of mental disorders for adolescents in Mexico City
##### G Borges,[a] C Benjet,[a] ME Medina-Mora,[a] R Orozco [b] & PS Wang [c]

Objective This study describes the prevalence, adequacy and correlates of 12-month mental health service use among participants
in the Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey.
Methods The authors conducted face-to-face household surveys of a probability sample of 3005 adolescents aged 12–17 years
residing in the Mexico City metropolitan area during 2005. The prevalence of mental health disorders and the use of services were
assessed with the computer-assisted adolescent version of the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
Correlates of service use and adequate treatment were identified in logistic regression analyses that took into account the complex
sample design and weighting process.
Findings Less than one in seven respondents with psychiatric disorders used any mental health services during the previous year.
Respondents with substance-use disorders reported the highest prevalence of service use and those with anxiety disorders the
lowest. Approximately one in every two respondents receiving any services obtained treatment that could be considered minimally
adequate.
Conclusion We found large unmet needs for mental health services among adolescents with psychiatric disorders in Mexico City.
Improvements in the mental health care of Mexican youth are urgently needed.

#### Introduction

In Mexico,[1] as elsewhere, only a minor­
ity of adults with psychiatric disorders
receive some form of treatment.[2–5]
However, it is unclear to what extent
this situation is similar for Mexican
adolescents. Some studies of adult popu­
lations have shown that younger adult
cohorts are more likely to receive care
than older cohorts.[6] However, other
studies, mostly conducted in developed
countries, have begun to shed light on
important shortfalls in the mental health
care received by adolescents.[7–12]

In 2001–2002, the National Insti­
tute of Psychiatry in Mexico conducted
the Mexico National Comorbidity
Survey,[1] which is part of WHO’s World
Mental Health Survey Initiative.[13,14]
Results for the urban Mexican adult
population showed that fewer than one
in five respondents with a 12-month
prevalence of a psychiatric disorder used
any service during the previous year and
only one in every two respondents who
used services received care that met
minimal standards for adequacy.[3] In


2005, the National Institute of Psychia­
try in Mexico conducted the Mexican
Adolescent Mental Health Survey
employing similar methodology.[15] We
report here the rate of mental health
service use in the previous year among
these adolescents, the adequacy of treat­
ments, and potential determinants of
service use and treatment adequacy.

#### Methods

###### Participants

The survey was designed to be repre­
sentative of the 1 834 661 adolescents
aged 12–17 years that are permanent
residents of private housing units in
the Mexico City metropolitan area. The
final sample included 3005 adolescent
respondents selected from a stratified
multistage area probability sample. In
all strata, the primary sampling units
were census count areas cartographi­
cally defined and updated by the Insti­
tuto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía
e Informática.[16] All households within
these city block units with adolescents
aged 12–17 years were selected. One


eligible member from each of these
households was randomly selected. The
response rate of eligible respondents
was 71%.

###### Procedures

Fieldwork involving face-to-face in­
terviews in the homes of the selected
participants was carried out from March
through August 2005 by interview­
ers who had received training in the
Composite International Diagnostic
Interview according to the WHO pro­
tocol stipulated for participating World
Mental Health countries. A verbal and
written explanation of the study was
given to both parents and adolescents.
Interviews were administered only to
those participants for whom a signed
informed consent from a parent and/or
legal guardian and the adolescent was
obtained. Although an adult had to be
present in the home during the course
of the interview, interviewers attempted
to interview the adolescent privately, i.e.
in another room. All study participants
were given a mental health resources
card with the contact information for

different institutions where they could
seek services should they wish to do
so. The Human Subjects Committee
of the National Institute of Psychiatry
approved the recruitment, consent and
field procedures.

###### Measures

Psychiatric disorders, service use and
potential correlates were assessed in the
Mexican Adolescent Mental Health
Survey using the computer-assisted
adolescent version of the World Mental
Health Composite International Diag­
nostic Interview (WMH-CIDI-A).[17]
The WMH-CIDI-A was adapted from
the adult version WMH-CIDI 3.0 used
in the Mexico National Comorbidity
Survey and validated in diverse coun­
tries and cultures.[18] The diagnostic
sections are similar to the adult version
except that the language has been sim­
plified to be more easily understood by
younger respondents, examples were
made more age appropriate (e.g. refer­
ences to school instead of work), and
criteria were changed to accommodate
caveats made for adolescents in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition
(DSM-IV).

###### Prevalence of mental disorders

The 12-month prevalence of the fol­
lowing categories of psychiatric disor­
ders were recorded: affective disorders
(major depressive disorder, bipolar I and
II disorder and dysthymia with hierar­
chy); anxiety disorders (panic disorder,
agoraphobia without panic disorder, so­
cial phobia, specific phobia, separation
anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety dis­
order and posttraumatic stress disorder);
impulse control disorders (intermittent
explosive disorder, oppositional-defiant
disorder, conduct disorder and atten­
tion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder); and
substance use disorders (alcohol and
drug abuse and dependence).

###### Mental health service use

Information was collected about the use
of mental health services, including the
type of professionals visited, use of selfhelp, support groups or hotlines, and
school-based programmes. The number
of treatment visits made was also as­
sessed and respondents could endorse
as many professionals and treatment
options as they had used in the previous
12 months.


Care received in the 12 months
before the survey was categorized into
the following sectors: (i) any mental
health specialty provider, including
psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors,
psychotherapists, mental health nurses
and social workers in a mental health
specialty setting; (ii) general medical
practitioners, including family physi­
cians and paediatricians; (iii) human
services, including outpatient treatment
with a religious or spiritual adviser or a
social worker or counsellor in any set­
ting other than a specialty mental health
setting; (iv) complementary-alternative
medicine and internet use, includ­
ing self-help groups, any other healer,
such as a herbalist, a chiropractor, or a
spiritualist and other alternative therapy;
and (v) school-based programmes that
consisted of any special schools, special
classes within a school and school-based
therapies.

###### Minimally adequate care

Available evidence-based treatment
guidelines for primary care[19] and special­
ty mental health providers [20–24] were used
to define minimally adequate treatment
during the previous 12 months as receiv­
ing: (i) minimally adequate psychothera­
py, consisting of four or more outpatient
visits to any provider [25,26]; (ii) minimally
adequate pharmacotherapy, consisting
of two or more outpatient visits to
any provider and treatment with any
medication for any length of time; [27] or
(iii) reporting still being “in treatment”
at the time of the interview. Although
this definition is broader than the one
that we used previously, [28] it allowed
us to obtain conservative estimates of
minimally adequate treatment across
sectors. In sensitivity analyses, a more
stringent definition of minimally ad­
equate treatment was also used in which
we required: (i) eight or more visits to
any service sector for psychotherapy,
or (ii) four or more visits to any service
sector and 30 or more days taking any
medication for pharmacotherapy.

###### Assessment of sociodemographic correlates

Information was collected on sex,
age and family grouping, i.e. whether
participants lived with both parents.
Participants were considered students
if currently enrolled. Adolescents were
asked whether they worked during the


school year, whether they were ever
married and whether they had children.
All three conditions represent an addi­
tional social burden not typical of most
adolescents; therefore, participants an­
swering affirmatively to any of the three
were categorized as having social bur­
dens. Adolescents were asked about the
educational attainment of each of their
parents. Parental education was then
categorized as none/primary (≤ 6 years
of education), secondary (7–9 years of
education), high school (10–12 years
of education) or college (≥ 13 years of
education) and the score of the parent
with the highest level of education was
used. Parent-reported family income was
categorized into low, average and high.

###### Analyses

The data were weighted to adjust for
differential probabilities of selection
and non-response. Post-stratification to
the urban Mexican adolescent popula­
tion according to the 2000 census in
the target age and sex range was also
performed. Standard errors for propor­
tions were obtained by the Taylor series
linearization method with SUDAAN
software (RTI International, Research
Triangle Park, NC, United States of
America).[29] Logistic regression analysis [30]
was performed to study demographic
correlates. Two parallel analyses were
performed, one for receiving any treat­
ment among those with disorders and
a second one for receiving minimally
adequate treatment among those with
disorders who received any treatment.
Odds ratios and corresponding stan­
dard errors from logistic regression
coefficients were also obtained with
SUDAAN and 95% confidence in­
tervals (CIs) were adjusted for design
effects. Statistical significance was
evaluated with two-sided design-based
tests with the 0.05 level of significance.

#### Findings

Table 1 shows that 9.1% of the ado­
lescents used any service for emotional
problems, with a higher use of services
among those with a disorder (13.7%)
compared to those with no disorder
(6.1%). Respondents with a substanceuse disorder reported the greatest use
of services, and those with an anxiety
disorder the lowest. For those with any
disorder, the health-care sector was the
most widely used for mental health

services (by 9.5%), with school-based
treatments being next most frequent.
Most services delivered by the healthcare sector were provided by mental
health specialists, with minimal partici­
pation of the general medical sector. The
disorder with the highest level of treat­
ment was drug abuse with dependence
(38%, largely treated in the non-health
care system), followed by conduct
disorder (25%, largely treated in the
health-care system; data not shown).

Among those with a psychiatric
disorder, 80% used only one type of
provider, 17% two types of provid­
ers, and 3% used three or more types
of providers. Among those that used
two providers, the most common
combination was for health care and
school-based providers. About 72% of
those used both services simultaneously,
while 18% used school services first and
later reported the use of a health-care
provider. In the health-care sector, the
mean number of visits was 7.8 for those


with a psychiatric disorder and 6.2 for
those without a disorder; for the nonhealth-care sector it was 19.1 and 16.5
visits respectively, and for school-based
services it was 14.9 and 16.9 visits, re­
spectively (results are not shown).

Table 2 presents the adequacy of
treatment. Overall, 58.4% of those
receiving any services obtained any
treatment that could be considered
minimally adequate, with anxiety dis­
orders showing the lowest percentage
and substance use disorders the high­
est. Those with a disorder were more
likely to receive adequate treatment
than those without a disorder and the
health-care sector showed the lowest
level of adequacy.

In sensitivity analyses using our
more stringent definition, the propor­
tion of respondents obtaining mini­
mally adequate treatment among those
with disorders receiving any services de­
creased to 27.2%; this proportion var­
ied between 22.2% among respondents


with substance disorders to 36.8%
among those with affective disorders.
(The results are not shown but are avail­
able upon request from G Borges.)

Table 3 presents sociodemographic
correlates of receiving any services, as
well as receiving minimally adequate
treatment, among respondents with
12-month prevalence of these disorders.
Females and those whose parents had
higher levels of education were more
likely to use services. Those attending
school and adolescents without any
“social burden” had increased, but not
significantly, odds ratios of receiving
treatment. The only significant cor­
relate of receiving adequate treatment
among those with a psychiatric disorder
receiving any treatment was those cur­
rently attending school.

The greater likelihood of service
use and adequacy of services for those
attending school may be related to
school-based programmes being exclu­
sively available for this group only. For

this reason, we refitted our models to
obtain results for health care and nonhealth care services separately. In these
analyses, respondents attending school
were no more likely to get health care
or non-health care services than those
not attending school. Nevertheless,
those attending school still had a sig­
nificantly increased likelihood (odds
ratio: 11.6; 95% CI: 3.5–38.2) of re­
ceiving adequate health care compared
to those not attending school (data not
shown).

#### Discussion

###### Main findings

Less than one in seven adolescents with
any psychiatric disorder in the last 12
months used any services. Although
this is the first time that representative
service use data are available for adoles­
cents in Mexico, prior research among
adults in Mexico also showed that the
majority of people with a recent psy­
chiatric disorder did not receive recent
treatment.[3,31,32] Comparable data from
other developed countries confirms
the large unmet need that adolescents
face.[8–12] A study of another Latino
population in Puerto Rico [7] showed
that only 26% of adolescents affected
by mental disorders used services. Our
results reveal the even larger gap that
adolescents in Mexico face, with only
14% of those with a disorder using any
service in the prior 12 months. Data
for comparison on service use in other
Latin American countries are lacking,
although the situation of scarce re­
sources, as well as few services and


personnel for treating children having
a mental disorder, is commonplace in
the region.[33] The lack of resources in
Mexico City may be similar to other
less-developed countries, although
more research is needed before we can
generalize our findings. Respondents
without a disorder comprised about
40% of the population using services,
raising concern that scarce resources
for mental health care may be misal­
located. However, some services may
be used by respondents with lifetime
histories of disorders; other respondents
without apparent disorders may also be
using services appropriately for primary
prevention, subthreshold symptoms
that do not qualify as full-blown dis­
orders or for disorders not assessed by
our survey.

Our results on the percentages re­
ceiving minimally adequate care (58%)
as well as a more stringent definition
(27%) are very low and similar to rates
reported among adults in Mexico,[3] sug­
gesting that the entire system of care for
mental disorders is in need of reform.
The system for child mental health care
in Latin America has been described as
excessively focused on serious and rare
disorders.[33] A recent evaluation of psy­
chiatric care in Mexico [34] concluded that
it is still mainly provided by large public
psychiatric hospitals. Even though this
study did not focus specifically on ado­
lescents, these conclusions could well
apply to youth.

There are many potential reasons
for failure to receive minimally ad­
equate care. Individuals with mental


disorders, especially those with the
most serious and impairing forms,
may suffer from considerable stigma­
tization and discrimination associated
with their mental disorder [32] and may
lack the ability and resources to consis­
tently access mental health treatments.[35]
Patients may also find prescribed treat­
ments intolerable.[36] Providers may lack
the training to recognize and properly
diagnose mental disorders or lack the
knowledge concerning optimal treat­
ment regimens.[37–39] These results may
not be surprising, given the dearth of
mental health resources in Mexico.[40]
It is noteworthy that there is only one
child psychiatric hospital in the entire
country, located in Mexico City.

Two sociodemographic character­
istics predicted the use of mental health
services among subjects with psychiat­
ric disorders, being female and having
more educated parents. Some studies
find adolescent males to be more likely
to receive services than females,[41] but
others have failed to do so.[8,10,11,42,43] It is
not clear why in this Mexican sample,
females with psychiatric disorders
were more likely to get services, but it
is possible that the Mexican culture,
that emphasizes protection of young
females more so than males, could
play a role or that deviant behaviour
is tolerated more in males than fe­
males. More educated parents may be
more likely to recognize symptoms of
distress and mental disorders in their
child and be able to seek treatment.[44]
It is possible that these adolescents
have more supportive environments

or more assistance in promoting treat­
ment adherence. Although Mexico is a
country with low socioeconomic status
and the lack of financial resources may
help explain the low rate of service use,
we did not find an association between
income and receiving any treatment
or minimally adequate treatment – a
lack of association also reported from
other studies in developed countries,[8]
but not all.[42,43]

###### Limitations

The Mexican Adolescent Mental Health
Survey is a household survey with a lim­
ited response rate (71%), representing
adolescents living in one of the largest
metropolitan areas in the world, where
health services are more available and
so these results may not be generalized
to other urban or rural areas of Mexico.
Furthermore, we did not interview
institutionalized or homeless adoles­
cents, we only assessed a limited subset
of DSM-IV disorders, and those more
affected by mental illness may be more
likely to have been non-respondents.
Although the WMH-CIDI-A was
adapted from the adult version used
in the Mexico National Comorbid­
ity Survey and validated in another
Spanish-speaking country,[18] the reli­
ability and validity of the adolescent
version used in this survey has not yet
been established in Mexico. This set
of limitations may have caused us to
underestimate the unmet needs for
mental health treatment and minimally
adequate treatment.

In addition, we used a definition of
minimally adequate treatment created
for the adult population.[5,13] Although
some investigators [45–50] have shown that
treatments conforming to recommen­
dations in evidence-based guidelines
improve clinical outcomes, we are not
aware of studies that validated our
exact definition of minimally adequate
treatment for this population.

Finally, we only examined rela­
tionships between a small number of
patient or family factors [44] and service
utilization, type and adequacy; we did
not have the ability to investigate other
potentially important variables, such as
the characteristics of service providers.
All variables assessed were subject to
misclassification which, especially if dif­
ferential, could have introduced bias.


Finally, we cannot conclude that factors
associated with receiving any treatment,
or minimally adequate treatment, are
related causally because of the study’s
cross-sectional nature.

#### Conclusions

Improvement in the mental health
care of Mexican youth is urgently
needed and should not depend only
on additional services and resources.
Our results shed light on an enor­
mous public health problem facing
Mexico. The large majority of those
with needs received no treatment from
any sector. The negative public health
consequences of such unmet needs for
treatment in adolescents are likely to be

large. In this context, the development
of additional mental health resources
is sorely needed and an essential first
step. However, reallocation of services
and providers will be needed to take ad­
vantage of the resources that are made
available. Active outreach, schoolbased programmes employing brief
screens may be needed for the accurate
identification of children with mental
disorders. Interventions to train nonhealth care professionals to recognize
children with mental health conditions
and make referrals for health care may
also be useful. Finally, even among
Mexican youth with mental disorders
from families with financial means,
addressing out-of-pocket costs and
other economic barriers may also be
