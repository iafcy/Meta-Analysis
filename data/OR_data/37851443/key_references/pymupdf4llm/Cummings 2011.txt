### Abstract

**Objective—Little is known about racial/ethnic differences in the receipt of treatment for major**
depression among adolescents. This study examines differences in mental health service use
among non-Hispanic white, black, Hispanic, and Asian adolescents who experienced an episode of
major depression.


**Method—Five years of data (2004–2008) were pooled from the National Survey on Drug Use**
and Health to derive a nationally representative sample of 7,704 adolescents (age 12–17)
diagnosed with major depression in the past year. Racial/ethnic differences were estimated with
weighted probit regressions across several measures of mental health service use controlling for
demographics and health status. Additional models assessed whether family income and health
insurance status accounted for these differences.

**Results—The adjusted percentages of blacks (32%), Hispanics (31%), and Asians (19%) who**
received any treatment for major depression were significantly lower than among non-Hispanic
whites (40%; p<0.001). Black, Hispanic, and Asian adolescents were also significantly less likely
than non-Hispanic whites to receive prescription medication for major depression, to receive
treatment for major depression from a mental health specialist or medical provider, and to receive
any mental health treatment in an outpatient setting (p<0.01). These differences persisted after
adjusting for family income and insurance status.


**Conclusion—Results indicated low rates of mental health treatment for major depression among**
all adolescents. Improving access to mental health care for adolescents will also require attention
to racial/ethnic subgroups at highest risk for nonreceipt of services.

### Introduction

The onset of major depression is common during adolescence[1] and associated with
substantial short and long-term health, developmental, and social consequences.[2][, ][3]

Although highly effective treatments are available,[4] major depression commonly goes
untreated.[5] It is therefore a central clinical and public health priority to identify the groups
most at risk for nonreceipt of care.

In adults, one of the most important predictors of failure to receive care for depression is
race/ethnicity – with members of racial/ethnic minority groups being 30% (African
Americans) to 50% (Asians) less likely to receive any mental health treatment compared to
non-Latino whites.[6] However, less is known about racial/ethnic differences in the receipt of
treatment for depression among adolescents. Although the existing literature has indicated
that racial/ethnic minorities may be less likely to receive services than non-Hispanic whites,
7[–]10 these studies have been limited by sample size constraints for assessing differences in
service use across multiple racial/ethnic groups, lack of population-based survey measures
to identify those with clinical depression, and/or little information about the treatment that
was received for depression. Thus, further research is needed with samples that are
nationally representative and with sufficient power to detect differences in service use across
multiple racial/ethnic groups identified with clinical depression.

This study examines differences in mental health treatment across four racial/ethnic groups
of adolescents with major depression (i.e. non-Hispanic whites, blacks, Hispanics, and
Asians) using a large, nationally representative sample. In addition to having sufficient
statistical power to make comparisons across these four groups, this study adds to existing
literature by characterizing racial/ethnic differences in service use with multiple outcome
measures including the receipt of any treatment for major depression, the use of prescription
medication for major depression, the receipt of treatment for major depression across
provider types, and the use of mental health services across inpatient, outpatient, and school
settings.


### Method

**Data**


Five years of data (2004–2008) are pooled from the National Survey of Drug Use and
Health (NSDUH), an annual, nationally-representative, cross-sectional survey that is
sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. NSDUH
samples non-institutionalized individuals ages 12 and older in the U.S. civilian population
from all 50 states and the District of Columbia in multiple stages. The survey was
administered in English and Spanish. Our study uses data from the adolescent component
(ages 12–17), which includes a series of questions to assess major depressive episodes
(MDE) experienced in the previous year, information about mental health services
utilization, health insurance status, and socio-demographic characteristics. Given the lack of
private identifiers in this publically available dataset, the Emory IRB determined that the
study did not meet the criteria for "Human Subjects Research" and that review was not
necessary.


**Study Sample**

Our analytic sample is derived from the sub-sample of adolescents who experienced an
episode of MDE in the previous year. Past year MDE was assessed with an adolescent
depression module administered using computer-assisted interviewing (CAI)
instrumentation. This module was adapted from the depression section of the National
Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent,[11] which is based on a modified version of the World
Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short Form (CIDI-SF).
12 For MDE, research has reported good psychometric concordance between the CIDI-SF
and the full CIDI.12 Furthermore, research has indicated a high concordance between the

**Measures**


full CIDI and independent clinical diagnoses in the adolescent population13 as well as in a
U.S. sample of English- and Spanish-speaking Latinos.14

Of the 90,855 adolescents who participated in the NSDUH between 2004 and 2008, 7,704
(8.5%) experienced MDE in the past year. When examining the prevalence of MDE
(unweighted) by race/ethnicity, 8.7% of non-Hispanic whites experienced MDE in the past
year, compared to 8.4% of Hispanics, 7.4% of Asians, and 7.3% of blacks.

**Treatment for Major Depression—After answering questions about MDE symptoms,**
adolescents were asked if in the past 12 months they talked to a medical doctor or other
professional about these problems or if they received prescription medication for these
problems. Two dichotomous measures assessed whether the adolescent received the
following in the past year: (1) any MDE treatment from a mental health professional and/or
medical professional and (2) any prescription medication for MDE. Two additional
indicators assessed whether the adolescent received MDE treatment from: (1) a mental
health professional (i.e. psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, counselor, and/or other
mental health professional), and a (2) a medical professional (i.e. general practitioner, family
doctor, other medical doctor, nurse, occupational therapist, and/or other health professional).


**Receipt of Mental Health Treatment Across Settings—NSDUH also provides**
information about past year mental health care use across settings irrespective of the specific
mental health problem for which the adolescent sought treatment. Three indicators assess
whether the adolescent: (1) had an inpatient stay for a mental health problem in a hospital
and/or a residential treatment center, (2) received any outpatient treatment for a mental
health problem at a clinic, day treatment center, therapist’s office, physician’s office, and/or
home residence, and (3) received counseling from an individual (e.g. teacher and/or
counselor) at school for a mental health problem. An additional measure was created for the
total number of mental health outpatient visits during the past year and analyzed in
supplemental analyses.

**Race/Ethnicity—Race/ethnicity was reported as five mutually exclusive categories: non-**
Hispanic white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and other race/ethnicity. Other race/ethnicity
comprises non-Hispanics who reported more than one racial background as well as groups
with cell sizes that were too small for statistical analyses (e.g. Native Americans).


**Socio-demographic and Health Status Measures—Prior research has indicated that**
age, gender, family status, income, and health insurance are important determinants of
mental health care use among youth.15[–][17] These socio-demographic characteristics were
assessed with a continuous measure of age in years (12–17), an indicator for females, an
indicator for family status identifying adolescents who live with two parents versus those
who do not, a categorical measure of family income (<$20K, $20K–$50K, $50K–$75K, >
$75K), and a categorical measure of insurance status (any private insurance, public
coverage, no insurance, and insurance status unknown). Lastly, although school enrollment
may differ across racial/ethnic groups and facilitate MH service use, this measure is not
included because 98% of the sample with MDE attends school.


To adjust for differences in underlying mental health status, analyses included an indicator
for whether adolescents reported that their depressive symptoms resulted in severe or very
severe impairment (versus no, mild, or moderate impairment) in at least one of four life
domains: chores at home, school or work, family relationships, or social life. Additionally,
because alcohol and drug use are correlated with depression,18 two indicators measured

### Results


alcohol abuse/dependence and illicit drug abuse/dependence based on a series of questions
designed to measure substance abuse and dependence according to DSM-IV criteria.11
Lastly, general health status, which is correlated with depression,19 was assessed with a
self-reported measure of fair or poor health status (versus good, very good, or excellent).

We estimated pooled weighted probit regressions and negative binomial regression models
with the “svy” procedure in Stata to account for the complex survey design elements in
NSDUH.[20] Sampling weights adjusted for differential probabilities of sampling selection,
non-response bias, and non-coverage bias. All models included year fixed effects. Risk
differences for each minority racial/ethnic group were estimated at the weighted mean
values of the control variables. The risk differences can be interpreted as the predicted
difference in the percentage of adolescents in a racial/ethnic minority group with a positive
value on the outcome variable compared to non-Hispanic whites, holding the covariates
constant at their mean value. Individuals with missing values on study variables are
excluded to yield two primary analytic samples: 7,618 adolescents for models examining
racial/ethnic differences in measures of MDE treatment and 7,598 adolescents for models
examining differences in mental health service use across settings.


According to the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) report Unequal Treatment: Confronting
_Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Healthcare, a health care disparity is defined as,_
“differences in the quality of healthcare that are not due to access-related factors or clinical
needs, preferences, and appropriateness of intervention.”[21] However, previous studies
implementing this definition to examine mental health care disparities among the adult
population have contended that “access-related factors” such as socioeconomic status (SES)
and health insurance status should not be accounted for when estimating the total disparity
in service use, but may be included in subsequent models to assess the degree to which they
mediate the disparity.6[, ][22] Although we do not explicitly examine differences in mental
health care quality, we estimate our models in a manner that is consistent with this general
approach by first adjusting for differences in demographics (i.e. age, gender, family status)
and mental health status and further adjusting for family income and insurance status in a
subsequent model.

Additional analyses assessed the robustness of findings when including measures of
population density (as a proxy for access to medical and mental health professionals)[23] and
language of interview (i.e. Spanish vs. English). Although all five years of NSDUH data
contain a measure of population density, these measures differ across years; consequently,
the creation of a single measure for use in the pooled data must be interpreted with caution.


Among adolescents with MDE, only 38% received any MDE treatment, 17% took
prescription medication for MDE, 30% received MDE treatment from a mental health
specialist, and 11% received MDE treatment from a medical provider (Table 1). When
examining measures of past year mental health treatment across settings, 5% had an
inpatient stay, 36% had an outpatient visit, and 25% received counseling in a school setting.
When comparing these measures across racial/ethnic groups using Wald tests, results
indicate that Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians are significantly less likely than non-Hispanic
Whites to receive any MDE treatment (p<0.01), use prescription medication for MDE
(p<0.001), receive MDE treatment from a mental health specialist (p<0.01), receive MDE
treatment from a medical professional (p<0.001), and have a mental health visit in an
outpatient setting (p<0.001). Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians also have lower family incomes

(p<0.001) and are less likely to have private health insurance (p<0.05) than non-Hispanic
Whites.

Controlling for demographics and health status (Table 2, Model 1), the absolute percentage
of racial/ethnic minorities who received any MDE treatment is between 7.6 (Blacks: 95%
CI=−12.3%, −3.0%) and 21.0 percentage points lower (Asians: 95% CI= −29.1%, −12.9%)
than among non-Hispanic Whites. In other words, the adjusted percentages of those who
received any MDE treatment are 31.9% for blacks, 31.0% for Hispanics, and 18.5% for
Asians, compared to 39.5% for non-Hispanic whites. These adjusted percentages for each
racial/ethnic group are depicted graphically in Figure 1, where the height difference between
the bars corresponds to the adjusted risk differences estimated in this model. After including
family income and insurance status, these risk differences are slightly reduced for each
group but remain statistically significant (Table 2, Model 2).

Results examining racial/ethnic differences in the use of prescription medication yield a
similar pattern (Table 2, Model 3). Among racial/ethnic minorities, the absolute percentage
of adolescents who use prescription medication for MDE is between 11.2 (Hispanics: 95%
CI=−13.9%, −8.6%) and 16.0 percentage points lower (Asians: 95% CI= −19.3%, −12.7%)
relative to non-Hispanic Whites. Consequently, the adjusted percentages of adolescents who
received prescription medication for MDE are 19.8% for non-Hispanic whites, 6.7% for
blacks, 8.6% for Hispanics, and 3.8% for Asians (Figure 1). As before, the inclusion of
family income and insurance status slightly accounts for these differences, but the findings
remain statistically significant (Model 4).


Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians are also significantly less likely than non-Hispanic whites to
receive MDE treatment from a mental health professional or a medical provider (Table 3:
Model 1, Model 3). Once again, the risk differences are largest for Asians. The adjusted
percentage of non-Hispanic whites with MDE who received treatment from a mental health
professional and a medical provider are 31.5% and 12.4%, respectively, compared to only
15.6% (RD=−16.0, 95% CI=−23.2%,−8.7%) and 2.2% (RD=−10.2, 95% CI=−12.8%,
−7.5%) of Asians with MDE (Figure 1). Although the inclusion of family income and
insurance status slightly reduces these differences, they remain statistically significant
(Model 2, Model 4).


Results examining racial/ethnic differences in past year mental health treatment across
settings among adolescents with MDE, irrespective of the problem that was treated, are
presented in Table 4. Although there are no racial/ethnic differences in the likelihood of
having an inpatient stay, there are significant differences in the likelihood of having an
outpatient visit and receiving counseling in a school setting. Findings from Model 3 indicate
that 39.7% (model based prediction not shown) of non-Hispanic whites received an
outpatient mental health visit during the year, compared to only 27.9% of blacks (RD=
−11.7%, 95% CI=−15.8%, −7.6%), 28.7% of Hispanics (RD=−11.0%, 95% CI=−14.9%,
−7.0%), and 23.1% of Asians (RD=−16.5%, 95% CI=−25.5%,−7.5%). These differences
are slightly reduced, but remain significant, after accounting for family income and
insurance status (Model 4). Lastly, results from Model 5 show that the percentage of
Hispanics (RD= −3.7%; 95% CI= −7.1%, −0.2%) and Asians (RD= −7.6%; 95% CI=
−13.7%, −1.5%) who received counseling in a school setting is significantly lower than
among non-Hispanic whites (24.5%; Model based prediction not shown).

Supplemental analyses further explored racial/ethnic differences in the number of outpatient
visits among those who received any outpatient treatment. Among adolescents who received
any outpatient visit, results from a negative binomial regression model indicated that
Hispanics have approximately 2.8 fewer visits per year (95% CI = −5.0, −0.6) than non

Hispanic whites, who have approximately 13.6 visits per year. This difference was slightly
reduced to 2.5 fewer visits among Hispanics after adjusting for family income and insurance
status. Blacks and Asians, however, did not differ significantly from non-Hispanic whites in
their number of outpatient visits. Lastly, supplemental models that also included language of
interview and population density were virtually unchanged across all outcome measures.


### Discussion

Findings from this nationally-representative sample revealed high rates of unmet need for
mental health treatment among all adolescents with MDE and sizeable racial/ethnic
differences in service use before and after adjusting for demographics and health status. The
adjusted percentage of non-Hispanic whites who received any MDE treatment was 40%,
compared to 32% among blacks, 31% among Hispanics, and 19% among Asians. Black,
Hispanic, and Asian adolescents were also significantly less likely than non-Hispanic whites
to receive MDE treatment from mental health professionals, to receive MDE treatment from
medical providers, and to have any mental health outpatient visits, with Asians exhibiting
the lowest rate of service use on each measure.

When examining racial/ethnic differences in the receipt of mental health outpatient
treatment, it is notable that although black, Hispanic, and Asian adolescents were
significantly less likely than non-Hispanic whites to receive any outpatient services, only
Hispanics had significantly fewer outpatient visits than non-Hispanic whites among those
who received services. This pattern of findings highlights the importance of implementing
programs to address the barriers that exist to entering the mental health care treatment
system for racial/ethnic minorities. Research has demonstrated that mental health care
quality improvement programs in primary care settings may improve care among youth with
depression, but may also have the benefit of reducing disparities in care for vulnerable
racial/ethnic subpopulations.[24]

The adjustment for socioeconomic status and health insurance status accounts for only a
small portion of the estimated differences in MDE treatment measures and outpatient
utilization across racial/ethnic groups. Consequently, our results suggest that other factors
are predominantly driving these differences. While stigma likely plays a large role in the low
rates of service use among all adolescents,[25][, ][26] it may also account for the differences in
service utilization across racial/ethnic groups[27] – especially for Asians.28[, ]29 In many Asian
cultures, seeking help for problems outside of the family is a source of shame.30
Navigational barriers such as limited English proficiency could also explain a portion of the
lower rates of service use among racial/ethnic minorities, especially among Hispanics and
Asians.[31] Even though supplemental analyses adjusting for language of interview (English
versus Spanish) did not account for any of the difference in service use observed for
Hispanic adolescents, it is possible that unmeasured differences in the English proficiency of
the parents could account for part of the observed differences in service utilization.


Unlike treatment in outpatient settings, we did not find any significant racial/ethnic
differences in the receipt of inpatient treatment. It may be that there is less discretion on the
part of both patients and providers in the decision to pursue inpatient treatment once a
mental health condition reaches the severity and acuity to require hospitalization. This
finding is consistent with research documenting that disparities are likely to be particularly
prominent under conditions of higher clinical uncertainty.[32]


The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) recommends that
antidepressants should be considered for adolescents who have severe, psychotherapyresistant depression.[4] More than 20% of non-Hispanic white adolescents reported using

_J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 February 1._

prescription medication for major depression, compared to 4% to 9% of Asians, blacks, and
Hispanics. Because NSDUH does not provide sufficient detail to determine whether the use
of prescription medication was consistent with AACAP guidelines for each individual, it is
unclear whether these patterns are indicative of worse access to treatment by minorities,
overutilization of medication by non-Hispanic whites, or both. However, racial/ethnic
differences remained significant in supplemental analyses in which separate regressions
were estimated for: (1) adolescents who reported having severe or very severe role
impairment due to MDE, and (2) for adolescents who did not (not shown). Results from
these supplemental models suggest that the overall racial/ethnic differences in prescription
drug use may represent greater overutilization by whites as well as underutilization by
racial/ethnic minorities.

We found that Asians and Hispanics with MDE are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to
receive school-based counseling. However, results from a previous study using data from
the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) did not find racial/
ethnic differences in the receipt of school-based counseling among adolescents with high
depressive symptoms.[9] One possible explanation is that there may be important differences
in the composition of the racial/ethnic subgroups that comprise Hispanics and Asians in each
dataset, although it is not possible to make a direct comparison because this information is
not available in the public-use NSDUH files. For example, because Cubans and Puerto
Ricans were oversampled in Add Health,33 they likely comprise a larger percentage of the
Hispanic population in Add Health than in NSDUH. Future research should collect data that
allows for comparisons across subgroups among the Hispanic and Asian adolescent
populations.

Notably, one-fourth of all adolescents with MDE received school-based counseling, and the
relative size of the difference in service use for Asians and Hispanics compared to nonHispanic whites is smaller in school settings than in outpatient settings. Furthermore, blacks
do not differ in their likelihood of receiving school-based counseling relative to nonHispanic whites. Considered altogether, these findings suggest that greater investment in
school-based mental health services could be one mechanism for reducing levels of unmet
need for mental health services among all adolescents as well as racial/ethnic disparities in
treatment. For example, the provision of mental health services through school-based health
centers (SBHCs) has been shown to increase mental health care utilization among lowincome adolescent populations across multiple racial/ethnic groups.[34] Moreover, racial/
ethnic minorities are as likely, if not more likely, to use SBCH services than non-Hispanic
whites.35[, ]36

Along with these significant findings, it important to acknowledge several limitations in this
study. First, causality cannot be established because the data are cross sectional. Second,
although there may be important subgroup differences in service use within the racial/ethnic
groups that were examined, it is not possible to disaggregate these groups any further due to
both small cell sizes (e.g. Native Americans and Alaskan Natives) and lack of information
about the country/region of origin for Hispanics and Asians. Third, because NSDUH was
only conducted in English and Spanish, there may be other non-English speaking
populations that are not represented in the sample. Fourth, several constructs such as family
status and health status are assessed with proxy measures that may be imprecise. Lastly, the
NSDUH public use files do not contain information about several mechanisms that could
further explain these racial/ethnic differences in service use including nativity, immigration
status, knowledge and stigma concerning mental health treatment, and geographic access to
providers.

Notwithstanding these limitations, this study documents low rates of mental health service
use among all adolescents with major depression and significantly lower rates among each
racial/ethnic minority group that was examined. Investment in quality improvement
programs implemented in primary care settings as well as school-based mental health
services may reduce unmet need for mental health services among all adolescents with
major depression as well as reduce the sizeable differences in service use across racial/ethnic
groups. Future research should seek to collect the necessary data to examine subgroup
differences and elucidate the distinct pathways that account for racial/ethnic disparities in
use of services.
