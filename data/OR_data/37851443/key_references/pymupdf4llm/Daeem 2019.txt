Abstract

Background: The Galilee Study assessed mental health service needs among Israeli Muslim and Druze adolescents
and their mothers. Studies show that mothers of adolescents belonging to the Arab minority have much lower
help-seeking rates than Jewish mothers. This paper examines mothers’ structural and cultural barriers to helpseeking.

Methods: All 9th grade students living in 5 towns representative of Muslim and Druze localities in northern Israel,
were eligible for the study and 1639 (69.3%) obtained parental agreement and participated. Emotional or behavioral
problem were assessed in the classroom using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. A total of 704
adolescent-mother dyads participated in the follow-up, and were interviewed at home, using the Development and
Well Being Assessment inventory, the Composite Barriers to Help-Seeking Questionnaire, the General Health
Questionnaire − 12, the Subjective Feelings of Discrimination Index and socio-demographic questions. Pearson χ

test and multivariate binary logistic regressions were performed to analyze mothers’ consultation rates by risk
factors. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to identify underlying factors and assess construct validity of the
Composite Barriers to Help-Seeking Questionnaire, and also mean scores and standard deviations for the distinct
scales were calculated.
Results: More mothers of adolescents with a mental disorder than those without a mental disorder consulted a
professional or school source (39.7% vs. 20.5%; χ[2] = 45.636; p = < 0.001). The most important barriers to help-seeking
were those related to “Accessibility”, followed by barriers related to the belief that “Treatment is detrimental” and to
the possibility of “Reprisal by authorities”. Barriers related to “Stigma” and “Distrust of professionals” had the lowest
means scores. Differences by ethnicity/religion were found.

Conclusions: Structural barriers related to lack of access, were considered the main obstacle to help-seeking in this
Israeli Arab minority population. Cultural barriers such as stigma were considered of secondary importance.
Structural barriers could be reduced by increasing the number of accessible public mental health clinics in the
minority localities, a responsibility of the Ministry of Health and the HMOs. Information campaigns and
psychoeducation for parents would help reduce other barriers to mental health treatment.

Introduction
The prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents,
according to a worldwide pooled estimate, is 13.4% [1].
The Israeli Survey of Mental Health among Adolescents
(ISMEHA), which included a nation-wide representative
sample of 14–17 year old Israeli adolescents, reported a
prevalence rate of 8.1% for internalizing disorders and of
4.8% for externalizing disorders [2]. The Galilee Study, focusing on Muslim and Druze Arab minority adolescents
in Israel reported prevalence rates of internalizing and externalizing disorders of 15.8 and 4.2%, respectively, among
Muslim adolescents and rates of internalizing and externalizing disorders of 5.9 and 5.5%, respectively, among
Druze adolescents [3]. Many studies show that only half of
those children and adolescents with a mental disorder receive any care and that less than one-fourth are cared for
by a mental health specialist [4–11]. The percentage of
untreated adolescents is known to be larger among minorities [5, 9, 12–19], and among socio-economically disadvantaged adolescents [20–22].
The ISMEHA showed that parents belonging to the
Arab minority in Israel were much less likely to seek help
when concerned for their children’s mental health than
parents from the majority population [9], although rates
of mental disorders of Jewish and Arab adolescents did
not differ significantly [2]. A possible reason for the disparity in help-seeking could be lack of public mental
health services. A mapping of public mental health clinics
for children and adolescents in Israel showed that in the
Northern and the Southern District, where over 80% of
the Israeli Arab population lives [23], only 16.8 and 4.3%
of Israeli Arab children in need of care, respectively, were
cared for by the mental health clinics [24].
Several factors may explain what prevents different
population groups from accessing mental health care for
themselves and their children. According to Cauce and
colleagues, help-seeking, whether from formal or informal sources, is influenced by structural, organizational,
cultural and social contexts [25]. Structural contexts
shape conditions of access—the number, type, affordability and quality of psychosocial supports available in a
community and those resources necessary to access
those further away [26–30]. Different organizational settings serve different populations: community-based
mental health centers are usually accessible to parents,
whereas teachers and school staff are an important and
available source for consultation by both parents and the
children themselves [5, 9, 25, 31–35]. Cultural factors influence perceptions of need for services, which rely upon
one’s explanatory framework for psychosocial problems—beliefs about their origin, how they can best be
resolved, and what constitutes a problem that is serious
enough to necessitate assistance from a professional
helper [14]. In addition, negative consequences and


perceptions, including stigma [36, 37], or negative effects
of treatment or mental health services [38], have been
associated with reduced help seeking behaviors. The
Child and Adolescent Service Assessment (CASA) [39],
in its assessment of obstacles to help-seeking, includes
additional factors such as fear, dislike, or distrust of professionals; prior negative experiences with professionals;
shame or anticipation of negative reactions; anticipation
that the child may be removed from the home or anticipation of loss of parental rights; and lack of accessibility
(information about services, bureaucratic hindrances,
language compatibility). Reardon and colleagues [11] in
their systematic review of 144 quantitative and qualitative studies concerning barriers to care, found that the
main barriers were systemic-structural barriers such as
accessibility, cost of services, waiting periods and getting
a referral. Following in order of importance were barriers related to views and attitudes towards services, in
particular feeling not listened to or dismissed/ blamed
by professionals. These were followed by barriers related
to loss of trust in professionals and fears concerning the
negative consequences of treatment, fear associated with
treatment itself, the detrimental impact of perceived
negative attitudes of others on help seeking, as well as
personal discomfort about mental health [11].
A number of concerns led us to further examine these
obstacles. First, the low percentage of Israeli Arab mothers
of children with mental disorders who consulted a professional source – 9% according to the ISMEHA [9]. Second,
the need to inform the health authorities responsible for
supervising and managing the Israeli Mental Health Reform approved as law in 2015, regarding ways to improve
service provision to minority Arab Palestinian citizens of
Israel (Arabs in Israel) in need of mental health care
through the HMOs. The Arabs in Israel are an indigenous
population, constituting about 21% of all Israeli citizens
and 25.5% of those below 19 years of age. Over 80% of
Arabs in Israel are Muslims, and the rest are mainly Druze
and Christian [23], and they are over-represented in all
the indicators of poverty, distress and underdevelopment,
with high unemployment rates and school drop-out rates

[40]. The Druze comprise a traditional and conservative
Arabic-speaking cultural group [41] who participate in the
Israeli military service. Druze males’ main employment is
with the security forces. This improves their economic
status and increases their adoption of norms of the Jewish
majority [42]. The Muslim Israeli citizens, on the other
hand, are a non-assimilated minority, mainly due to the
continuing state of conflict between Israel and the Arab
world, which has placed them in the status of a hostile minority outside the national consensus [43].
Considering the urgent need for mental health care for
adolescents, the aim of the present study was to identify
the barriers to mental health care among Muslim and


-----

Druze minority adolescents and their mothers. We posed
several questions that needed clarification. They were:
Which barriers to help-seeking are considered to be most
important by mothers? Do these perceptions differ by ethnicity or type of disorder suffered by the adolescent? In
what ways are mothers’ perceived barriers to help-seeking
different according to whether they consulted or not? The
goal of this study is to better understand obstacles to
help-seeking for mental health concerns, in particular
structural obstacles related to accessibility to services and
cultural factors associated with stigma.

Methods
The study population
Five localities representative of the Muslim and Druze
towns and cities in northern Israel insofar as population
size, geographic location and ethno-national composition,
were chosen to participate in the study. The 2012–2013
cohort of 9th grade students in these five Arab localities
(N = 2366) was included in the study, excluding those who
had dropped out, were non-school attenders, or were
studying in out-of-town schools.

Instruments and measurements

a. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) –
Self-reported Arabic version was used to assess
emotional and behavioral problems of the adoles[cents (http://www.sdqinfo.com). The SDQ, a](http://www.sdqinfo.com)
screening instrument designed for evaluating functioning in 4–17 year old children and adolescents

[44], includes 25 items covering four clinical domains: hyperactivity-inattention, emotional symptoms, peer-relationship and conduct problems, and
one pro-social behavior domain. The psychometric
properties of the SDQ in Arabic have shown to be
satisfactory [45, 46].
b. Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA)
[– Arabic version – (http://www.dawba.info), [45,](http://www.dawba.info)
47], was used to diagnose mental disorders.
DAWBA is a multi-informant package of questionnaires, interviews and rating techniques that
generate ICD-10 and DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses for children aged 5–17. These include internalizing disorders (separation anxiety, specific
phobias, social phobia, panic attacks and agoraphobia, post-traumatic stress, compulsion and obsessions, generalized anxiety and depression and
deliberate self-harm), externalizing disorders
(hyperactivity-inattention and awkward and
troublesome behavior), eating disorders, autistic
spectrum and other disorders. In our study questions relating to troublesome behaviors (e.g.,
whether the child has lied, stolen or been


questioned by the police), were censored by the
Israeli Ministry of Education and excluded from
the questionnaire, purportedly to prevent students’ self-incrimination.
c. The General Health Questionnaire-12 item version
(GHQ-12), assesses mother’s risk of developing a
psychiatric disorder as defined by distress and
inability to carry out normal functions [48].
Mothers in the highest 33% of the distribution were
considered as being at high risk and those in the
lowest 67% as being at low risk. The Arabic version
has an internal reliability (Cronbach alpha) of .86

[49].
d. Subjective feelings of discrimination: Four items
adapted from the Public Regard Subscale of the
Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity [50],
relating to how others respect one’s community,
behave towards it, appreciate it and feel it
contributes to the State of Israel were used. These
four items were pooled into a “Feeling of
Discrimination” Index (FDI) and categorized as high
or low. The FDI had an internal reliability
(Cronbach alpha) of 0.885.
e. Obstacles to professional help-seeking: The
Composite Barriers to Help-seeking Questionnaire
(CoBaQ), includes 14 questions pertaining to 4 parameters taken from the Child and Adolescent Services Assessment (CASA) [39], and three additional
questions pertaining to one parameter added by the
Galilee Study’s research team. In all, the CoBaQ included five parameters and 17 items. The four parameters expressed in 14 statements taken from the
“Perceptions of Barriers to Service” from CASA are
the following: 1. Fear, dislike, or distrust of professionals or previous negative experience; 2. Selfconsciousness or anticipation of negative reaction;
3. Anticipation of out of home placement or loss of
parental rights; 4. Accessibility: Incomplete information, time spent, concerns about cost, problems
with transportation, problems with bureaucratic
delay, problems with availability, language. The fifth
parameter added by the Galilee Study team was:
Perception that treatment is not beneficial or helpful and might even damage.
f. Personal attitude towards help-seeking: Mothers
were asked to assess the statement: “If my child had
emotional or behavioral problems I would seek help
or treatment for him/her”. They could choose one
of four options: 1) definitely agree; 2) partly agree;
3) partly disagree; 4) definitely disagree. Given that
more than 87% of mothers declared they definitely
agreed, options 2, 3 and 4 were categorized as “do
not agree” and the analyses were carried out on a
dichotomized item.


-----

g. The socio-demographic data reported by the
mothers included: religion, family size, parental
educational, marital status, whether the family was
in the care of a welfare agency and whether the
adolescent had a learning disability (LD).
h. The socio-economic level of the locality in which the
family lives was defined according to the ranking of
local authorities published by the Central Bureau of
Statistics of Israel [51]. The parameters used for
this classification were: demography (median age,
dependency rates and percentage of families with 4
or more children), education (average years of
schooling of adults aged 25–54 and percentage with
an academic degree), employment and benefits
(percentage of salaried workers aged 15+,
percentage of women aged 25–54 with no workrelated income, percentage of employed earning
double the average wage, percentage of workers
earning less than minimum wage and percentage
receiving benefits), standard of living (e.g. average
monthly income and number of vehicles owned).
The 255 Israeli local authorities are ranked and
assigned to socio-economic clusters ranging from 1
(lowest) to 10 (highest). The localities included in
this study belong to clusters 4, 3 and 2, as do nearly
90% of the Arab localities in Israel, and were classified into three socio-economic levels: a) medium
(cluster 4), b) low (cluster 3), and c) very-low (cluster 2).
i. Help-seeking and consultation: Mothers were asked
whether they had ever spoken about the emotional,
behavioral or social problems of their child with a
professional or with any other source such as
primary health practitioner, pediatrician, internal
medicine or any other medical specialty,
psychiatrist, psychologist, another mental health
specialist (social worker, psychiatric nurse, art
therapist, language therapist), alternative medicine
specialist, school advisor, teacher, school nurse,
school psychologist, special education teacher, any
other school source, self-help group, internet support group, chat-room, religious leader, social
worker from the welfare services, family members,
friends and other non-professional adults. We included in the “consulted” category mothers who
sought help from a health or mental health professional or a school source. Those who sought help
from a family member, self-help groups, friends, or
through the internet were not included in this
category.

The study design
The study included a screening stage in the classroom
and a follow-up stage at home. Adolescents with higher


probability of having an emotional or behavioral problem according to the SDQ were over-sampled, in order
to increase statistical power and the robustness of the
analyses. In each locality all students in the highest 25%
of the SDQ score distribution were considered at high
risk for an emotional or behavioral problem and included in the sample for the follow-up stage, together
with a simple systematic sample of students in the lower
75% of the distribution.

Procedures
Only students whose parents signed an informed consent and had turned it in were recruited and requested
to complete the SDQ in the classroom between September 2012 and May 2013. The follow-up took place between October 2013 and May 2014, when adolescents
and their mothers were interviewed face-to face at their
home, simultaneously and independently, by two lay interviewers. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Rabin Medical Center (Request No, 6339).

Statistical analyses
Mothers’ consultation practices were analyzed by
socio-demographic and health-related risk factors and
psychosocial traits of adolescents, using Pearson χ2 test,
with a significance level set at ≤0.05. Multivariable binary logistic regressions were performed with consulting
a professional or school source as dependent variables.
Logistic regression coefficients were transformed into
odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Internal consistency of the CoBaQ and distinct scales was
assessed with Cronbach’s alpha. An exploratory factor
analysis (EFA) was performed to identify underlying factors and assess construct validity of the CoBaQ [52].
Mean scores and standard deviations for the distinct
CoBaQ scales were calculated.
All data were weighted to account for the sampling design in each locality and SQD category in order to
generalize the study sample to the reference population
as follows: The inverse sampling probability of each individual in the sample was divided by the mean of the inverse sampling probabilities of all individuals in the
group to yield a weighting variable scaled such that the
mean weight of all individuals is 1 and the weighted
sample size equals the actual, unweighted sample size

[53]. Statistical analyses were conducted using an IBM
SPSS-21 module (IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS
Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM
Corp.).

Data collection and response rates
Data were collected in two stages. During the first stage,
the screening stage, the total response rate was 69.3%. In
the follow-up stage, each one of the four localities was


-----

assigned a different sampling fraction according to size,
in order to include approximately the same number of
subjects in each locality. Response rates were around
90%, except for Locality 4, where lack of street names
and house numbers made finding the families difficult.
Total response rate among located subjects was 92.3,
and 84.5% when including refusals and not located in
the “non-response” category.
Selected characteristics of adolescents who agreed to
participate in the study (N = 1639), and of those who refused (N = 727), were compared. Among those who refused, there was a higher proportion of boys than among
those who participated (59.4% vs. 42.5% respectively), and
a higher proportion of students considered by teachers to
be “low achievers” (34.7% vs. 21.9%, respectively). No differences were found by religion (Data not shown).

Results
Actual help-seeking practices
Overall, 24.4% of Muslim mothers and 20.7% of Druze
mothers consulted a professional or school source.
Among Muslim mothers of children with a mental disorder 37.3% consulted, while among those with no disorder 21.3%% consulted (χ2 = 24.49; p = .001). Among
Druze mothers of children with a mental disorder 47.9%
consulted, while those with no disorder 17.3% consulted
(χ2 = 24.36; p = .000).
Table 1 presents mothers’ consultation rates by socio-demographic, health-related and psychosocial traits of adolescents. Mothers of boys had higher consultation rates
than mothers of girls, mothers in the low socio-economic
index had higher consultation rates than those in the
medium or very low socio-economic indexes, mothers in
families that were in care of a welfare agency had higher
consultation rates than those who were not. Mothers of
adolescents with an internalizing or externalizing disorder
or a LD had higher consultation rates than mothers of
those without a disorder or a LD, mothers with a high
GHQ score had higher consultation rates than those with
a low GHQ score and mothers of adolescents who felt uncomfortable at home had higher consultation rates than
mothers of adolescents who felt comfortable at home.
In a logistic regression model we found that mothers of
adolescents with an internalizing disorder were twice as
likely to consult than those without an internalizing disorder, mothers of adolescents with an externalizing disorder
were 5.7 times more likely to consult, those in welfare care
were 2.2 times more likely to consult and mothers with a
high GHQ score were 1.5 times more likely to consult than
those with a low GHQ score. Religion and whether the adolescent feels uncomfortable at home were not found to be
significantly related to maternal consultation over and
above the effect of the other variables. (Table 2).


More mothers of adolescents with an externalizing disorder than an internalizing disorders consulted a professional or school source. Among adolescents with an
internalizing disorder 34.8% of their mothers consulted
and among adolescents with an externalizing disorder
59.4% of their mothers consulted. This yields a treatment gap of 65.2% for internalizing disorders and 40.6%
for externalizing disorders. (Data not shown)

Personal attitudes towards help-seeking
In all, 87.1% of mothers said they would seek help if
their child had a mental disorder. We found no significant differences in the positive attitude of mothers towards help seeking according to whether their child had
or did not have a disorder (90.3% vs 86.5%, respectively;
χ2 = 2.88; p = 0.09). Among mothers of children with a
mental disorder who had stated that they would definitely consult, 43.4% actually consulted while of those
who had stated they would not consult, 11.5% did consult (χ2 = 9.90; p = 0.002) (Data not shown).

Barriers to service use as measured by the Composite
Barriers to Help-seeking Questionnaire (CoBaQ) cale
The 17 items included in the CoBaQ, the instrument
used to assess obstacles to use of service among mothers
in our study, were analyzed and their psychometric traits
are presented.

Construct validity
Exploratory factor analysis was performed on the
CoBaQ, in order to assess the construct validity of the
instrument in our population. Principal components
analysis (PCA) was used as the algorithm to maximize
the variance explained [54]. Varimax rotation was applied as it maximizes the squared loadings of a factor,
gives similar results to many oblique factorial solutions
and produces an orthogonal solution [54]. To guide interpretation of the results of EFA, values in excess of
0.46 were used. For CFA statistical significance, model
fit and significant loadings were used.
Figure 1 shows the items originally included in each
subscale and how these items were interpreted and
re-categorized by our Arabic speaking population. Only the
“Distrust in professionals” subscale loaded on the corresponding factors, while all other subscales were modified
by our population. “Lack of information regarding services”
and “Professionals don’t speak Arabic” – both items originally included as part of the “Accessibility” subscale loaded
with the “Fear of reprisal” subscale and the “Treatment
damages” subscale, respectively. “Public knowledge of treatment may damage future chances”, originally belonging to
the “Stigma” subscale, loaded on the “Treatment damages”
subscale.

Internal consistency
The CoBaQ (17 items), had a good internal consistency
(α = .82) (See Table 3). The Stigma (anticipation of negative reactions) subscale had the highest reliability (α = .78),
followed by the Accessibility subscale (α = .75), the Treatment is detrimental subscale (α = .62), the Fear of reprisal
by authorities (loss of rights) subscale (α = .52) and lastly
the Distrust in professionals subscale (α = .35).
However, when re-categorizing the subscales according
to the factors that arose from the factorial analysis for
this specific population (see below), we found slightly
higher internal consistency for all subscales, except for
the Accessibility subscale which became somewhat less
consistent and the Distrust of professionals which
remained the same. The Stigma subscale showed a high
reliability (α = .90), followed by the Accessibility subscale
(α = .71), followed by the Treatment damages subscale
(α = .65), followed by the “Fear of reprisal” subscale (α
= .61), and ending with the “Distrust of professionals”
subscale (α = .35).

Mean scores
Mean scores for the CoBaQ subscales show that obstacles related to “Accessibility” had the highest mean score
(M = 2.34; SD. = 2.6), followed by obstacles related to
the belief that “Treatment is detrimental” (M = 1.32; SD
= 2.2), followed by obstacles related to the possibility of
“Reprisal by authorities” (M = 0.97; SD = 1.5), by obstacles related to “Stigma” (M = 0.55; SD = 1.2), and lastly
by obstacles related to “Distrust of professionals” (M =
0.27; SD = 0.6).

Mean CoBaQ scores by religion, type of mental disorder
and help-seeking practices
Mean scores for the CoBaQ subscales and comparisons
by religion are presented in Fig. 2. No differences were
found regarding obstacles related to “Accessibility” and
to the belief that “Treatment damages”. However, we
found that significantly more Druze than Muslim
mothers saw the danger of “Reprisal by the authorities”
as an obstacle to help-seeking (F = 85.15; p = .000) and
significantly more Muslim than Druze saw “Stigma” and
“Distrust in professionals” as obstacles to help-seeking
(F = 41.44; p = .000, and F = 4.01; p = .046, respectively).
Figure 3 shows that more mothers of adolescents with
an internalizing disorder thought that Reprisal or Distrust in professionals were obstacles to help-seeking (F
= 22.02; p = .000 and F = 8.35; p = .004, respectively).
Figure 4 shows that more mothers of adolescents with
an externalizing disorder than mothers of those without
thought that obstacles related to accessibility were very
important (F = 7.7; p = .006).
Figure 5 shows that mothers who did consult gave
more importance to obstacles related to accessibility and
to distrust of professionals than mothers who did not
consult (F = 38.5; p = .000 and 17.0; p = .000, respectively). Mothers who did not consult gave more importance to obstacles related to stigma than mothers who
did consult (F = 16.1; p = .000).

Discussion
One of the main findings of the Galilee Study was that
37.3% of Muslim and 47.9% of Druze mothers of children with any mental disorder consulted a professional
or school source, in comparison with 9% of Arab Israeli
mothers in the ISMEHA study carried out in 2004–
2005. The treatment gap was between 63% and 52% for
any mental disorder, which is somewhat higher than the


-----

average in many parts of the world [5–8, 55], but is
lower than the treatment gap found in the ISMEHA
among Arab Israeli mothers [9]. There may be a number
of possible explanations for this. One is the secular trend
– the time elapsing between the studies, which may
point to an increase in help-seeking among minority
populations with increasing engagement with Israeli
norms [56]. Another possible explanation is that the
Galilee Study included a different population than that
of the ISMEHA, as only Muslim and Druze living in the
Northern and Haifa Districts were included, while the
ISMEHA included also Bedouin populations in the
Southern District, who have the lowest socio-economic


and educational status of all Israeli citizens [57]. A third
possible explanation for the increase in help-seeking
among minority groups between 2004 and 2005 and
2012–2014 is that rates of mental disorders may be actually increasing among minority adolescents in Israel:
while the ISMEHA found a prevalence of internalizing
and externalizing disorders of 9.1 and 1.9%, respectively
for Arabs in Israel [2] the Galilee study found a prevalence of internalizing and externalizing disorders of 15.8
and 4.2%, respectively, among Muslim adolescents who
comprise nearly 80% of the Arabs in Israel [3].
A multivariable analysis indicated, as expected, that
over and above the effect of other variables, mothers of

children with an internalizing or externalizing disorder
were 2 times and 5.7 times more likely, respectively, to
seek help. Similar findings have been reported by others

[5, 10, 33, 58]. Mothers in families in welfare care were
2.2 times more likely to seek help and mothers with a
high GHQ score themselves were 1.5 times more likely
to seek help. These findings may be related to the fact
that both groups are familiar with or have had previous
exposure to positive experiences with similar services.
Our findings support studies that have found that the
main variable promoting help-seeking is the existence of
a mental disorder or mental distress in the adolescent

[10, 31, 59–61], as well as those who have found that
mental distress of the mother [60, 62, 63] and other
problems in the household which require the intervention of the welfare agencies make help-seeking more


likely. There is very likely an interplay between child and
maternal health, their reciprocal relationships and cumulative disadvantage [64], which makes sense of the
higher rates of mental problems among adolescents who
experience poor parental emotional well-being and family adversity [65].
In our assessment of attitudes towards help-seeking we
found that 87% of mothers stated that they would seek
help if their child had a mental disorder. However, among
them, less than half (43.4%) of mothers of children with a
mental disorder, actually consulted. In the analysis of attitudes of mothers towards possible potential structural and
cultural barriers to help-seeking, one of our most important findings was that, contrary to the common prejudice
that minorities do not seek treatment due to fear of stigma

[66, 67], the main obstacles for mothers in our study were


-----

those related to access to mental health care, that is, structural factors that may be remedied by the authorities responsible. This finding is in agreement with what was
found by Reardon and colleagues [11] in their systematic
review, that in the first place, systemic-structural barriers
such as accessibility, cost of services, waiting times and
getting a referral were the most dominant cultural attitudes related to obstacles to help-seeking. We found that
the beliefs that treatment might be detrimental and that
there might be reprisal by the authorities if they find out
about help-seeking, were ranked in second and third
place. In the fourth place mothers mentioned stigma as an
obstacle to help-seeking and lastly they mentioned their
distrust in professionals.
Our exploratory factor analysis suggests that the factors underlying the CoBaQ are distinct constructs,


although in our study population three items in the original scales are cross-loaded to other scales. Of particular interest are our findings that two items which
originally were part of the “Accessibility” scale were
cross-loaded: ‘lack of information’ was cross-loaded to
“Fear of reprisal by authorities” and ‘professionals do not
speak Arabic’ was cross-loaded to the “Treatment damages” subscale. This would imply that ‘lack of information’, is perceived by our minority populations as being
the fault of the help-seeker rather than that of the service provider. This is an important distinction, with implications for the role of service providers to engage the
community and provide information through schools,
maternal and child health clinics and HMOs regarding
how to access mental health services when needed. The
cross-loading of the second item – ‘professionals do not


-----

speak Arabic’, which originally belonged to the “Accessibility” scale to the “Treatment damages” scale would indicate that the fact that professionals speak Hebrew and
interview the adolescents and their parents in a language
that is not their own may be deleterious in terms of
miss-diagnosis and/or inappropriate treatment. Language here is perceived as more than a tool for access; it
may have powerful potential for damage. Mental health
diagnosis and treatment are based on communication
between patient and caregiver, and therefore, without
the aid of language-free and objective tools, language is
of utmost importance.
A third item – ‘public knowledge of treatment may
damage future chances’, originally belonging to the
“Stigma” scale, was cross-loaded by our minority population to the “Treatment damages” scale. In this case, it is
not just a matter of stigma for the subject seeking help
but rather concrete future damage that makes mothers
prefer to do without.
Our finding concerning the perception that “treatment
damages” is in agreement with findings among black ethnic minorities in the USA [68, 69], that report that black
and ethnic minority populations are cautious about their
contact with mental health care; “… black people are disadvantaged in society, and there is a perception that mental health services reinforce some of these disadvantages,
as they believe that mainstream mental health services
cannot offer positive help” [68].
When studying the meaning of the different constructs
in different cultural contexts and languages, it is also necessary to address questions related to translation. Questionnaires that are translated and used in cultures that
are very different from those for which they are originally created, may partly explain the disagreement between our EFA and the original “Perception of Barriers
to Service” of the CASA version 5.0 [39]. For one, there
might be inherent problems in the scale which measures
more heterogeneous content than intended [9]. It is also
possible that the translation suffers from lack of semantic equivalence [70] as could be the case if one of the
items had a slightly different meaning in Arabic and
among these subjects than in English. A third possibility,
favored by us, is that different cultural norms, social desirability and experience as a discriminated minority
produce different results.
Although of less importance than “Accessibility” for
both population groups, a finding that called our attention
was that more Druze than Muslim mothers believed “Reprisal by authorities” to be an obstacle to help-seeking.
This is a very interesting finding, given that the Druze are
much more integrated into Israeli society; their male citizens participate in the military and security forces and
they are recognized as partners to the Jewish population.
The Muslim population, on the other hand, are perceived


as “on-trial citizens”. Thus, despite their somewhat elevated status, Druze mothers believed that an obstacle to
help-seeking would be the reprisal by authorities. One
possible explanation for this is that Druze youth are enrolled in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), and this is the
main venue for them to enter the Israeli mainstream and
improve their socio-economic status. Since they aim for
high ranking positions in the IDF and for future employment in the security forces, they may be wary to
jeopardize their future chances by having been diagnosed
or labelled with, or treated for a psychiatric problem [71,
72], especially when considering employment-related discrimination [73].
Mothers of adolescents with an externalizing disorder
were more likely to perceive obstacles related to accessibility as being very important. When analyzing perceived
obstacles to help-seeking according to actual practices of
mothers we found that mothers who did consult gave
more importance to obstacles related to accessibility and
distrust of professionals, and less importance to obstacles related to stigma than mothers who did not consult.
It is possible that mothers who did consult actually had
a realistic perspective of barriers to help seeking as they
experienced difficulties related to accessibility and faced
problems related to their trust in the professionals caring
for their kin.

Limitations
One limitation of this study is that the sample includes
only school attendants and thus misses drop-outs or
non-attenders who usually are a high risk population.
However, in Israel, school attendance in the 9th grade is
mandatory and therefore in this population drop-out
rates are relatively low [74]. Another limitation is that it
was not possible for us to register the socio-economic
status of each family and thus, have only an estimate of
the socio-economic index of the locality in general. For
this reason, although we found that “Accessibility” was
the main obstacle to help-seeking, we could not assess
whether mothers who lived in a locality with a mental
health clinic had in fact higher rates of help-seeking than
those living in a locality without a mental health clinic,
independently of socio-economic and educational characteristics of the family. In our sample religion and
socio-economic index were highly correlated (Pearson
correlation = .707), as were locality and religion and locality and existence of mental health clinic. It will be of
great importance to obtain in the future a better estimate of familial socio-economic level in order to further
understand the populations’ choices.

Conclusions and recommendations
Lack of access to mental health services, rather than cultural obstacles such as stigma, was considered the main


-----

obstacle to help-seeking in this Arab minority population. This findings stands in opposition to a common belief among many health professionals and policy makers
who believe that even if services were available, the
Arabs in Israel would not use them due to stigma. That
stigma is not the main obstacle to help seeking is significant because a change in cultural norms requires
long-term process involving the population, whereas lack
of accessibility to professional services, which is the responsibility of the regulator (the Ministry of Health) and
of those providing the care (the HMOs), could be remedied more promptly by a change in policy. It is important to emphasize that this study deals with help-seeking
and not with obtaining treatment but we might deduce
that the rates of youth in need that do not get treated
are even higher. Consequently, a major recommendation
is to increase the number of public mental health clinics
in the minority localities; to provide appropriate transportation and to make services available in a reasonable
period of time. Since lack of knowledge about the existence of treatment was perceived in our study as the fault
of the population itself, a further recommendation is the
development of information campaigns by the authorities in order to acquaint the minority populations with
the different services available. Psychoeducation for parents, who are the gatekeepers and responsible for their
children’s mental health service use [38, 75, 76], as well
as interventions to address anxiety related to detrimental
treatment and stigma may be very helpful in advancing
mental health service use among adolescents and their
families. As well, psychoeducation for the schools’ educational staff, who could be made aware of the need for
referral to more professional mental health services for
some students would be beneficial and this would require strengthening the ties between the school staff and
the child and adolescent mental health clinics in the
vicinity.
In this population, mothers and adolescents seek help
mainly from school sources, which have the advantage of
being free and available at all times without the need for
transportation, and are characterized by a language and
cultural fit between students and school staff. There is,
therefore, an urgent need to coordinate the government
agencies involved in mental health service provision for
children and adolescents, so that school mental health services are integrated into the rest of the services and provide quality professional mental health care to adolescents
and their families. It is important that policy makers create
a plan with clear goals and schedules that must be met in
order to reduce the treatment gap, giving preference to
population groups where the gap is highest.
