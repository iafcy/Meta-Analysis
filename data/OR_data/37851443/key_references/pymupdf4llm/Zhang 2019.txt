**Abstract**
Depression has been increasing rapidly and is prevalent among youth.
Inadequate mental health service utilization for youth and relevant racial/
ethnic disparities are a growing concern. The current study used a nationally
representative database to examine racial/ethnic disparities in youth
depression prevalence, mental health services utilization, and psychotropic
medication receipt. The sequential examination shows that depressed
minority youth (22%-30%) were not only much less likely to use specialty
mental health services than depressed Caucasian and multiracial youth
(40%-43%, p < .001), they were also much less likely to receive psychotropic
medications (22%-30%) than their Caucasian and multiracial counterparts
(38%-44%, p = .048 to <.001) when using specialty mental health services.
The findings reveal possibly two levels of racial/ethnic disparities at the
decision points of accessing specialty mental health services and subsequent

Depression has rapidly evolved from a rare phenomenon to a common symptom in youth population over the past several decades, with about 13% of
children 12 to 17 years old ever experiencing a Major Depressive Episode
(MDE) in their lifetime (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality,
2018b). Depression is often characterized by chronic or frequently recurring
episodes, and is often comorbid with other psychiatric conditions such as
anxiety, externalizing disorders, and substance use (Zahn-Waxler, Shirtcliff,
& Marceau, 2008). Depression is one of the leading causes of disability and
a major risk factor for suicide. More than half of depressed youth suffer from
daily life functional impairment, learning difficulties, or other dysfunctional
living situations (Merikangas et al., 2010), and depression is implicated in
nearly half of youth suicidalities (Thapar, Collishaw, Pine, & Thapar, 2012).
In addition, early onset of depression is also associated with treatment resistant depression later in life (Hatcher-Kay & King, 2003).
Racial/ethnic disparities in youth mental health utilization have long been
a concern. Mental health services can be distinguished between specialty and
non-specialty services. Specialty services are typically provided in specialized mental health service facilities, which can be further categorized into
inpatient and outpatient services, while non-specialty services often refer to
services provided by non-mental health professionals or at school-based settings (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2017; Garland
et al., 2005; Gudiño, Lau, Yeh, McCabe, & Hough, 2009; Zhang, Smith, &
Tabb, 2018).
Nationally, less than four tenths of youth with an MDE in the past year
received mental health services (Cummings & Druss, 2011; Zhang et al.,
2018). Significant racial/ethnic disparities persist despite continuous efforts
aimed at reducing the disparities (Alegria, Vallas, & Pumariega, 2010). When
compared with depressed Caucasian youth, African American and Hispanic
depressed youth were about one fifth less likely to receive treatment, while
Asian American depressed youth were about half as likely (Cummings &
Druss, 2011). A recent national study shows that depressed African American
and Hispanic youth were about 30% to 40% less likely to receive specialty


-----

mental health services than depressed Caucasian youth, although there was
no difference in the use of non-specialty services (Zhang et al., 2018).
The disparity is similarly manifested among youth who are in public care
systems. Studies examining youth 6 to 18 years old in the public care system
including child welfare, juvenile justice, special education, alcohol and drug
abuse, and mental health service sectors found that more than two thirds of
Caucasian youth used formal outpatient services compared with about half of
the Latino and African American youth and one third of the Asian American
youth, but there was no significant difference in the use of non-specialty services (Garland et al., 2005). The findings concerning racial/ethnic disparities
of non-specialty mental health tend to be mixed, with some suggesting the
existence of such disparities in school settings (Bear, Finer, Guo, & Lau,
2014; Guo, Kataoka, Bear, & Lau, 2014) while others not when examining
the general youth population or youth in a large public care system (Garland
et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2018).
Racial/ethnic disparities in mental health service use are also reflected in
the choice of treatment methods, particularly in the use of psychotropic medications for treatment. Trial evidence has suggested that psychotropic medications are effective in the treatment of youth mental health problems including
depressive symptoms, in particular, for younger youth, boys, and youth with
less severe depressive symptoms (Strawn, Dobson, & Giles, 2017). However,
the use of psychotropic medications among youth has been controversial
(Loy, Merry, & Hetrick, 2012; Olfson, Blanco, Liu, Wang, & Correll, 2012)
due to concerns of inadequate evidence showing efficacy (Loy et al., 2012;
Morris & Stone, 2011; Olfson et al., 2012) and potential risks such as suicidalities (Vries, Jonge, Kalverdijk, & Bos, 2016), weight gain (Loy et al., 2012),
and diabetes (Hammerman, Dreiher, & Klang, 2008). Despite such concerns,
psychotropic medication use, especially off-label use (usage for symptoms
not indicated by authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration

[FDA]), on the clinical youth population has increased dramatically over
time (Loy et al., 2012; Olfson et al., 2012; Vries et al., 2016). For example,
the use of antipsychotics for children increased eightfold in the decade after
the mid-1990s, with about half of the prescriptions being considered off-label
(Alexander, Gallagher, Mascola, Moloney, & Stafford, 2012). The rapid
expansion has made youth even more likely to receive antipsychotic prescriptions from psychiatrists than older adults (Olfson et al., 2012).
Similar to mental health service use, substantial racial/ethnic disparities
exist in the use of psychotropic medications for the treatment of depression in
youth. About one fifth of Caucasian youth with a past year MDE received
psychotropic medications for treatment, which was about 2 to 3 times that of


-----

African American and Hispanic counterparts, and 5 times that of Asian counterparts after adjusting demographic and other factors (Cummings & Druss,
2011). The disparity pattern largely persists as shown in a more recent
national study (Zhang et al., 2018). Research examining youth enrolled in a
state Medicaid program revealed similar patterns, where White youths were
about 2.2 to 3.8 times more likely to receive psychotropic medications than
African American youth after adjusting other factors (Zito, Safer, Zuckerman,
Gardner, & Soeken, 2005).
Various factors may contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in mental health
services use. Mental health–associated stigma may compromise youth mental health services access (Radovic et al., 2015; Richardson, 2001), and it is
often amplified in minority cultural contexts (Guo et al., 2014). For example,
compared with Caucasian youth, Asian American youth were less willing to
express mental health problems and service needs because they tend to view
them as a burden to family and friends (Guo et al., 2014).
Minority youth, especially African American and Hispanic youth, are
often in socioeconomically disadvantaged families, whose financial hardship
and lack of insurance are often barriers to mental health services (Kataoka,
Zhang, & Wells, 2002; Santiago, Kaltman, & Miranda, 2013; Wirback,
Möller, Larsson, & Engström, 2018). However, income alone may not sufficiently reflect the profound impact of economic disadvantages on youth mental health services use (Cummings & Druss, 2011). Recent statewide studies
in Ohio and New York revealed that youth mental health seeking was a burdensome process and typically required 40 to 50 days waiting time (Gallo
et al., 2018; Olin & Clark, 2016; Steinman, Shoben, Dembe, & Kelleher,
2015). Parents of African American and Hispanic youth often work on benefits stringent jobs (Patten, 2017; Rae, Claxton, Levitt, & McDermott, 2019),
which may limit their accommodation of youth mental health service seeking. Referential systems may also play a role. Compared with Caucasian
youth, African American youth with moderate mental health symptoms were
found less likely to be referred to needed mental health services; and they
also tended to receive services with inferior quality (Alegría, Lin, & Green,
2012; Alegria et al., 2010; Snowden, 2003).
Despite extensive research on racial/ethnic disparities concerning youth
mental health service use, there are noticeable limitations. Many studies
examine mental health service access and psychotropic medication use separately rather than sequentially, which makes it hard to tell whether the racial/
ethnic disparity in medication use is due to the variation in mental health
service initiation, or indicates another race/ethnicity-related decision disparity in the treatment process. To address the limitations, the current study used
a nationally representative database to examine (a) among all youth, the


-----

racial/ethnic variation of youth depression prevalence; (b) among the
depressed youth, the racial/ethnic disparity concerning the use of specialty
and non-specialty mental health services; and (c) among the depressed youth
who received specialty mental health services, the racial/ethnic disparity concerning psychotropic medication use. In addition, most studies that examined
racial/ethnic disparities did not distinguish youth of two or more races/ethnicities from other groups, although the proportion of individuals identifying
as of two or more races/ethnicities has been increasing dramatically. In our
analysis, we included youth identifying as of two or more races/ethnicities as
a stand-alone group for examination.

## Method

 Sample

The sample consisted of 7 years of pooled data (2010-2016) derived from the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), a nationally representative study that annually surveyed non-institutionalized individuals 12 years
and older in the U.S. civilian population across all 50 states and the District
of Columbia. About one quarter to one third of the annual NSDUH survey
respondents were youth 12 to 17 years old, and these respondents were used
as the base to examine the prevalence of youth’s past year and lifetime
depression (n = 131,777). Furthermore, the study focused on youth who had
a past year MDE to examine racial/ethnic discrepancies in their use of specialty and non-specialty mental health services (n = 11,553). Finally, the
study examined racial/ethnic discrepancies of receiving psychotropic prescriptions (Rx) among youth who had a past year MDE and received specialty mental health services (n = 4,380).

_Measures. Youth with lifetime and past year MDE were measured using_
an adapted version of the depression section of the National Comorbidity
Survey–Youth derived from the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview–Short Form (CIDI-SF; Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration, 2017). The CIDI-SF has been validated to show good psychometric concordance with the full CIDI (Kessler,
Andrews, & Mroczek, 1998). Youth were coded as whether having a past
year or lifetime MDE (yes/no) based on the criteria (Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration, 2017).
As defined by the NSDUH (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration, 2017), specialty mental health services (yes/no) indicated
whether a youth reported receiving mental health services in the past year


-----

from any of six specialty inpatient/residential or outpatient sources for nonalcohol or drug-related behavior or emotional problem: a hospital, residential
treatment facility, day treatment facility, mental health clinic, private therapist, and in-home therapist. Specialty mental health services can be distinguished into inpatient and outpatient services (Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration, 2017). Inpatient services (yes/no) indicated
whether a youth received specialty mental health services from an overnight
stay in a hospital or residential treatment facility. Outpatient services (yes/no)
indicated whether a youth received specialty mental health outpatient services from a day treatment facility, mental health clinic, private therapist, or
in-home therapist. Non-specialty mental health services (yes/no) indicated
whether a youth reported receiving mental health services in the past year
from any of five specific non-specialty sources for non-alcohol or drugrelated behavior or emotional problem: a school social worker, school psychologist, or school counselor; a special school or program within a regular
school for students with emotional or behavioral problems; a pediatrician or
other family doctor; a juvenile detention center, prison, or jail; and/or foster
care or therapeutic foster care (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration, 2017).
Rx (psychotropic medication) use (yes/no) indicated whether youth were
prescribed with psychotropic medications for their MDE in the past year
(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2017). Nearly
all youth who received Rx for MDE had received specialty mental health
services. Overnight stay/visit indicated the number of nights or visits youth
made to specialty mental health services or settings, and was an ordered variable (0, 1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 24, 25 and more stays or visits).
Family structure is derived from two questions that asked youth if their
mother or father were at home to indicate three family types: two-parent families, single-parent families, and non-parent families based on whether both
parents were at home, one parent was at home, or no parent was at home.
Youth mental health was closely associated with behavioral problems
(Fearn et al., 2016; Pickering & Kaplan, 2006; Vaughn, Nelson, Salas-Wright,
DeLisi, & Qian, 2016; Vaughn, Salas-Wright, DeLisi, & Maynard, 2014).
Two dichotomous variables (yes/no) were used to indicate whether youth had
alcohol and illicit drug abuse or dependence problems. In addition, antisocial
behavioral problems (yes/no) indicated whether youth had reported any of
the following antisocial behaviors: serious fight at school or work, group
fight, carrying a handgun, selling illegal drugs, stealing or trying to steal item
more than US$50, and attacking with intent to seriously harm.
For youth with a past year MDE, function impairment due to depressive
symptoms was measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), which


-----

assessed the severity of function impairment in four domains of daily life,
including chores at home, school, or work; family; and social life. The variable was coded as severe or very severe versus moderate or less severe based
on the most severe rating across the four domains (Leon, Olfson, Portera,
Farber, & Sheehan, 1997; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration, 2017).
Other variables include race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White or Caucasian,
African American, Hispanic, Asian, two or more races, and Other), age
(12-13, 14-15, 16-17), gender (male/female), self-rated health status (excellent or very good vs. good or below), household income (less than US$50,000
vs. US$50,000 or more), having health insurance coverage (yes/no), region
(large metro, medium metro, and non-metro), and survey year (from 2010 to
2017).

_Analytical methods. We first conducted descriptive analyses to present_
sample characteristics across six racial/ethnic groups, which were based
on the whole youth population in the sample. Next, we conducted bivariate
analyses to examined racial/ethnic discrepancies in the use of specialty and
non-specialty mental health services, Rx, and the mean overnight stays/visits,
which were based on youth who were identified as having a past year MDE.
Third, we used three logistic regression models to examine the association
between race/ethnicity and three outcome variables: whether youth had a past
year MDE, whether youth who were identified as having a past year MDE
used specialty mental health services, and whether those who were identified
as having a past year MDE and received specialty mental health services
were prescribed with Rx. Finally, we estimated the probabilities of youth
experiencing a past year MDE, using specialty mental health services, and
receiving Rx across racial/ethnic groups after adjusting confounding factors
based on the outputs from the logistic regression models. Following weighting strategies suggested for NSDUH (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2018a; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive,
2014), STATA svyset and svy procedures were used to account for the complex survey design so that the estimates were representative of the national
non-institutionalized youth population.

## Results

 Descriptive Analysis Results

There were slight age differences but no difference in gender composition
across racial/ethnic groups. Most youth (69.35%) were in two-parent families,


-----

but African American youth (42.42%) had a comparatively lower rate. Slightly
more than half (52.96%) of the youth were in a family with income US$50,000
or more, but African American (28.01%) and Hispanic (32.09%) youth were
at a substantially lower rate (p < .001). About three quarters (75.94%) of the
youth rated their health status as excellent or very good, but the “Other” race/
ethnicity group (64.64%, p < .001) were less likely to do so. Most (93.97%)
youth had health insurance coverage, but the rate for Hispanic youth (87.65%,
_p_ < .001) was comparatively lower. On average, 3.1% of the youth had alcohol abuse or dependence problems, but the rate for Asian American (1.2%)
and African American youth (1.65%, p < .001) was comparatively lower. On
average, 3.85% of youth had illicit drug abuse or dependence problems, with
Hispanic (4.51%) and “Other” race/ethnicity youth (5.05%) having the highest rate, and Asian American youth (1.57%, p < .001) having the lowest rate.
More than one quarter (27.82%) of youth had some type of antisocial behavior
in the past year, with African American youth (36.51%), youth who identified
as of two or more races (33.09%), and “Other” race/ethnicity youth (37.2%)
having a higher rate, and Asian American youth (17.75%) having a lower rate.
Slightly more than half of the youth (54.85%) lived in a large metro area, with
the highest rate for Asian American youth (77.27%), and the lowest rate for
the “Other” race/ethnicity youth (35.75%, p < .001; see Table 1).
Overall, about one in six (15.37%) youth experienced an MDE in their
lifetime, and the rate of experiencing an MDE in the past year was about one
in 10 (10.45%). African American youth had the lowest lifetime (12.57%)
and past year (8.08%) MDE, while youth who identified as of two or more
races had the highest lifetime (18.26%) and past year (12.77%, _p_ < .001)
MDE. Among youth with a past year MDE, the majority (70.87%) were identified as having severe to very severe functional impairment due to MDE, but
there was no noticeable difference across race/ethnicity (Table 1).

## Bivariate Analysis Results

Table 2 presents the use of different types of mental health services among
youth who were identified as having a past year MDE. On average, more than
one third (36.54%) of youth with a past year MDE received specialty mental
health services, with a small fraction of them (6.28%) receiving inpatient
services, and most of them (35.58%) receiving outpatient services. Caucasian
(40.71%) and youth who identify as of two or more races (45.54%) were
most likely to receive specialty services, while Asian American (21.77%)
youth were least likely to receive specialty services (p < .001). Racial disparities in specialty mental health services were reflected in the use of specialty outpatient services (p < .001), however, there were no significant


-----

-----

-----

racial discrepancies in the use of inpatient services. About one third (34.04%)
of youth received non-specialty mental health services, and there were no
significant racial/ethnic discrepancies. A little less than one fifth (17.96%) of
youth who were identified as having a past year MDE received Rx, with
Caucasian (22.09%) and youth who identified as of two or more races
(22.96%) at the highest rate and Asian American (8.73%) youth at the lowest
rate (p < .001). Youth with a past year MDE, on average, had 1.29 (SE = 0.03)
overnight stays in, or visits to, specialty mental health services, with
Caucasian (M = 1.47, SE = 0.04) and youth who identified as of two or more
races (M = 1.38, _SE_ = 0.15) at a higher than average number and Asian
American (M = 0.85, SE = 0.17) youth at a lower than average number.

## Multivariate Analysis Results

Table 3 presents the results from logistic regression models that used race/
ethnicity and other covariates to predict three outcome variables: past year
MDE prevalence in the youth population; the use of any specialty mental
health service in the past year among youth who were identified as having a
past year MDE, and the receipt of Rx among youth who were identified as
having a past year MDE and also received specialty mental health services.
When examining factors associated with youth having a past year MDE
(Table 3, Model 1), minority youth (except for Asian American youth and
youth who identified as of two or more races) had a 11% to 40% lower
odds of experiencing a past year MDE than Caucasian youth (odds ratio

[OR] = 0.6-0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.55, 0.98]). Among the
covariates, older youth (14-17 vs. 12-13 years old), being in single-parent
or non-parent families (vs. two-parent families), having alcohol and illicit
drug abuse or dependence, having antisocial behavior, and being included
in the survey in more recent years (2012 and later vs. 2010) were all significantly associated with a higher odds of experiencing a past year MDE.
However, being male, reporting excellent or very good health, and living in
non-metro rather than metro areas, were significantly associated with lower
odds of experiencing a past year MDE (Table 3, Model 1).
When examining factors associated with receiving specialty mental health
services among youth having a past year MDE (Table 3, Model 2), minority
youth (except for those who identified as of two or more races and the “Other”
race youth group) had a 44% to 67% lower odds of receiving specialty
mental health services for MDE than Caucasian youth (OR = 0.43-0.66,
95% CI = [0.29, 0.76]). Among the covariates, being in single-parent or
non-parent families (vs. two-parent families), having a family income of
US$50,000 or higher, having severe or very severe functional impairment


-----

-----

-----

due to an MDE, having alcohol and illicit drug abuse or dependence, having
antisocial behavior, and being included in the survey in more recent years
(2014 and 2016 vs. 2010) were all significantly associated with a higher odds
of receiving specialty mental health services. However, being male, reporting
excellent or very good health, and no insurance coverage were significantly
associated with lower odds of receiving specialty mental health services
(Table 3, Model 2).
When examining factors associated with receiving Rx for youth who were
identified as having a past year MDE and who also received specialty mental
health services (Table 3, Model 3), minority youth (except for those who
identified as of two or more races) had a 47% to 74% lower odds of receiving
Rx than Caucasian youth (OR = 0.36-0.53, 95% CI = [0.16, 0.99]). Among
the covariates, older youth (14-17 vs. 12-13 years old), being in non-parent
families (vs. two-parent families), having severe or very severe functional
impairment due to an MDE, having alcohol and illicit drug abuse or dependence, and being included in the survey in more recent years (2014-2016 vs.
2010) were all significantly associated with higher odds of receiving Rx.
However, having a family income of US$50,000 or higher, reporting excellent or very good health, and no insurance coverage were significantly associated with lower odds of receiving Rx (Table 3, Model 3).
Figure 1 was based on the model outputs presented in Table 3 to visualize the predicted probability of youth experiencing a past year MDE, using
specialty mental health services, and receiving Rx after controlling for
confounding factors. The predicted risk of having a past year MDE was
similar across racial/ethnic groups (8%-9%) except that African American
and “Other” youth were somewhat lower (5%-6%, _p_ = .008 to <.001).
Among youth with a past year MDE, the predicted probability of using
specialty mental health among minority youth (22%-30%, p < .001) was
substantially lower than Caucasian youth (40%) and youth of two or more
races (43%). Among youth who had a past year MDE and received specialty mental health services, the predicted probability of receiving Rx
among minority youth (22%-30%, p = .048 to <.001) was also substantially lower than Caucasian youth (44%) and youth of two or more races
(38%) (Figure 1).

## Discussion

Using a large nationally representative database, the study examined racial/
ethnic disparities on depression prevalence and the use of mental health services and psychotropic medications among youth 12 to 17. Distinctive from
previous studies, the current study treated accessing mental health services

and use of psychotropic medications as sequential decision points and
revealed multilevel racial/ethnic disparities throughout the process.
Our findings indicate that, on average, about one sixth of youth (15.37%)
experienced a past year MDE, with the highest percentage among youth of
two or more races (18.26%) and the lowest proportion among African
American youth (12.57%) (Table 1). The rates for non-Hispanic White,
Hispanic, and Asian American youth range from 13.87% to 15.97%. These
findings are generally consistent with those of previous research (Center for
Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2017; Cummings & Druss, 2011).
They also further highlight multiracial youth’s especially high risk of experiencing depression, which is consistent with findings from emerging research
in the area, such as a study that examined a large sample of high school students (Fisher, Reynolds, Hsu, Barnes, & Tyler, 2014). Today, more than 17%
of married couples are interracial, and 14% of offspring identify as multiracial (Bialik, 2017). Due to the growth among this population, it is important
to pay close attention to their high mental health risks and service needs.
By focusing on youth with a past year MDE, we examined racial/ethnic
disparities of youth accessing mental health services based on whether
depressed youth ever used non-specialty and specialty mental health services.
The findings are consistent with previous findings that only a small proportion


-----

of youth in need of mental health services seek specialty mental health services, and there are substantial racial/ethnic disparities (Cummings & Druss,
2011; Garland et al., 2005; Gudiño et al., 2009). After adjusting covariates,
depressed youth of two or more races (43%) and Caucasian youth (40%) are
much more likely to use specialty mental health services than depressed
minority youth (22%-30%, p < .001; Figure 1). Further breakdown analyses
suggest that the racial/ethnic disparities are mainly manifested in the use of
outpatient services but not inpatient services (Table 2). The inconsistency
between outpatient and inpatient services may be due to the difference of case
nature. Depressed youth who seek inpatient services are likely under serious
conditions that require immediate specialty treatment. In such cases, factors
contributing to racial/ethnic disparities such as parental perceptions of mental
health services may be less influential as they are with less imminent cases
that usually seek outpatient services.
The patterns of racial/ethnic disparities among specialty service utilizers as
indicated in the bivariate analyses (Table 2) are confirmed by the multivariate
analyses that control for various confounding factors including clinical, family, social, economic, and other characteristics (Table 3 and Figure 1). Among
covariates, income is not linked to specialty mental health services use disparities in depressed youth, but having no health insurance coverage is linked
to lower likelihood of using specialty services (Table 3), which support previous findings that health insurance coverage is fundamental to meet mental
health service needs regardless of family income levels (Cummings & Druss,
2011). The findings also suggest the need of examining family social economic status more than income to understand its impact on mental health services usage, because family social economic status related factors such as
caregivers’ time flexibility, social support, parenting skills, and communication efficacy with service providers have been found to be closely linked to
youth mental health access (Gallo et al., 2018; Harrison, McKay, & Bannon,
2004; Olin & Clark, 2016; Steinman et al., 2015).
The prominent racial/ethnic disparities in specialty mental health service
use may be attributted to racial/ethnic disaprites of parental and youth perceptions of mental health services (Alegria et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2014;
Sherman & Ali, 2017). Perceptions of mental health services are often linked
to stigma (Clement et al., 2015; Lindsey, Joe, & Nebbitt, 2010) that affects
minority youth most significantly (Eisenberg, Downs, Golberstein, & Zivin,
2009; Guo, Nguyen, Weiss, Ngo, & Lau, 2015). For example, compared with
people of other cultural backgrounds, Asian Americans are more likely to
stress the importance of contributing to family and friends while avoiding
“bothering” them with issues such as mental health problems, leading to
restrictions in expressing mental health needs and services seeking (Guo


-----

et al., 2014; Kim, Sherman, & Taylor, 2008; Telzer & Fuligni, 2009). A
national study showed that African Americans are more likely to link mental
health problems such as depression to violent behavior (Anglin, Alberti,
Link, & Phelan, 2008). Another contributor to racial/ethnic variation of perceptions on mental health services may derive from mental health literacy.
Research has suggested that youth whose parents recognize youth internalizing mental health problems are much more likely to use mental health services than youth whose parents do not (Breland et al., 2014), while minority
families are more likely to lack such mental health literacy and service
resources (Abe-Kim et al., 2007; Gudiño et al., 2009).
About one third of depressed youth in our sample received non-specialty
mental health services, and there were few racial/ethnic disparities. Nonspecialty services such as counseling services by school psychologists and
social workers are more likely to be initiated by non-parental adults, and thus
may be less subject to the influence of parental perceptions and other racial/
ethnic-related factors. For example, previous studies have suggested that
there are few racial/ethnic disparities in school-based youth mental health
service identification and referrals (Alegría et al., 2012).
The most interesting findings are the revelation of racial/ethnic disparities
in psychotropic medication use among depressed youth who received specialty mental health services. We limited the sample for the examination to
youth who were identified as having a past year MDE and also used specialty
services, which eliminates the possibility that the disparities may be caused
by racial/ethnic variation in the use of specialty mental health services among
depressed youth. The results show that among depressed youth who also used
specialty mental health services, Caucasian youth (44%) and youth of two or
more races (38%) were much more likely to receive psychotropic medications than their counterparts of other racial/ethnic groups (22%-30%, _p_ =
.048 to <.001), after controlling for confounding factors (Figure 1). The findings advance the understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in youth mental
health service utilization. Previous studies usually examined racial/ethnic
disparities in psychotropic medication use among the whole youth population
or among youth who were identified as having depression or other mental
health symptoms (Cummings & Druss, 2011; Marcus & Olfson, 2010;
Olfson, Druss, & Marcus, 2015). Such analyses could not disentangle whether
the disparities in psychotropic medication use were due to racial/ethnic variation of service initiation, or actually signaled an additional racial/ethnic disparity after mental health service initiation. Our current two-stage analyses
resolved such an issue, and the results tend to suggest that racial/ethnic disparities occur not only when depressed youth and families decide to use


-----

specialty mental health services but also, additionally, at the time when they
receive psychotropic medications after initiating the specialty services.
Given the fact that youth in disadvantaged settings such as the child welfare system or Medicaid are often more likely to be prescribed with psychotropic medications (Bellonci et al., 2013; Brenner, Southerland, Burns,
Wagner, & Farmer, 2014; Lee, Walker, & Bishop, 2016), it is unlikely that
mental health professionals would be less willing to prescribe psychotropic
medications to depressed minority youth. More likely, minority youth and
their caregivers’ preferences and perceptions play an important role that leads
to the racial/ethnic disparities in psychotropic medication use. Studies have
suggested that youth and their parents prefer psychotherapeutic treatment and
express concerns toward psychotic medications (Bradley, McGrath, Brannen,
& Bagnell, 2010; McHugh, Whitton, Peckham, Welge, & Otto, 2013).
Furthermore, studies have found that depressed African American patients
viewed antidepressants as less acceptable than non-Hispanic White patients
(Cooper et al., 2003), and African American adults were less willing to use
psychotropic medications for themselves or children (Schnittker, Freese, &
Powell, 2000). About two thirds of African Americans relative to more than
one third of Caucasians were concerned that patients were treated as uninformed experimental participants when receiving prescriptions from physicians (Corbie-Smith, Thomas, & St. George, 2002).
Compared with their counterparts of Caucasian and youth of two or more
races, depressed minority youth are not only less likely to initiate specialty
mental health services, but also less likely to receive psychotropic medications
after they initiate the services. Such disparities suggest that concerns toward
psychotropic medication prescriptions may inhibit youth seeking needed mental health services from the beginning. Given that minority youth especially
African American youth and their parents have a higher level of concern
toward psychotropic medications than their Caucasian counterparts (Cooper
et al., 2003; Schnittker et al., 2000), depressed minority youth and their parents may be especially concerned that mental health treatment is affiliated
with psychotropic medication use and try to avoid initiating the services. The
dramatic increase in psychotropic medication use among youth clinical population along with the concerns about their largely off-label use, efficiency, and
risks (Loy et al., 2012; Morris & Stone, 2011; Olfson et al., 2012; Vries et al.,
2016) may further feed such a deterring effect. Future research is needed to
further examine the possible link between the perception of psychotropic
medications and the initiation of mental health services.
There are limitations in the study. First, NSDUH only surveys general
populations but not homeless and institutionalized youth such as youth in the
juvenile systems who may have a different pattern on the examined


-----

outcomes. This limits the scope of the findings’ implications. Second, the
accuracy of MDE and some other key measures remains a concern.
Researchers have long been concerned that culturally based mental health
reporting may bias the estimation. For example, Asian Americans’ low prevalence of mental health problems and service use may be attributed to potential underreporting because of a strong stigma attached to these issues in
Asian culture. This may be further complicated by language barriers and
Western culture–based mental health definitions that can overlook symptoms
unique to Asian populations (Sue, Cheng, Saad, & Chu, 2012). Finally,
despite rich information in the database, NSDUH surveys only asked whether
youth took prescribed medications for MDE symptoms in the past year. This
limits further exploration of racial/ethnic disparities in other important
dimensions such as the use of multiple types of medications and length in
medications (dosReis et al., 2011).

## Conclusions and Implications

Racial/ethnic disparities in the use of mental health services and psychotropic medications are serious public health concerns, and it is important to
advance the understanding of such disparities for more responsive policy
and practice considerations. Our findings reveal that youth of two or more
races are at the highest risk of experiencing depression and deserve special
attention, especially with their sizable and increasing proportion in the youth
population. The study reveals similar patterns of racial/ethnic disparities at
the decision points of accessing specialty mental health services and subsequent use of psychotropic medications, which suggest that race/ethnicity is
associated with not only the initiation of specialty mental health service use
but also the choice of mental health treatment methods. One plausible explanation is that service-needing youth and their families’ concerns on psychotropic medication may deter their initiation of mental health services use,
and such concerns may be more amplified in minority youth and their caregivers than their Caucasian counterparts (Cooper et al., 2003; Schnittker
et al., 2000; Sue et al., 2012). If this is the case, it is important to strengthen
rigorous evidence that shows psychotropic medications’ efficacy and low
risks on youth clinical populations to reduce such concerns to achieve both
an improvement in access to mental health services and a reduction of racial/
ethnic disparities. It may also highlight the importance of promoting evidence-based psychotherapeutic treatment for youth mental health treatment,
which has been well accepted by the youth and parents (Watanabe, Hunot,
Omori, Churchill, & Furukawa, 2007). Future research is needed to disentangle causes underlying racial/ethnic disparities between the use of


-----

specialty mental health services and psychotropic medications to verify such
an assumption for policy and practice considerations.
