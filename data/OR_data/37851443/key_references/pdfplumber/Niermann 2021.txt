time service utilization rates were determined by a standardized interview (DIA-X-5/CIDI).
DSM-5
Results: In the present sample, 23.3 % of adolescents and young adults fulfilled DSM-5 criteria for at least one
lifetime anxiety disorder. Of those, 39.1 % used any health care services, most frequently they visited an
outpatient psychotherapist/psychologist (23.0 %). Individuals with agoraphobia were most likely to use any in-
or outpatient specialized service (64.8 %), while individuals with a specific phobia were least likely (22.3 %).
Having a comorbid disorder or being female increased the likelihood of seeking help.
Conclusion: The results showed that approximately 2/3 of adolescents and young adults suffering from an anxiety
disorder did not seek help and only few report contacts with a psychotherapist. Given the adverse long-term
consequences of anxiety disorders, these findings suggest to improve efforts on increasing intervention aware-
ness and treatment possibilities for these individuals.
