through other social services. The number of those
whohadreceivedtreatmentininpatientsettings(19%)
was higher than that of those with anxiety disorders.
The only factor significantly associated with mental
health services utilization was the presence of a past
suicide attempt (Table 2).
Becauseofthefrequentcomorbiditybetweenanxiety
and depression, the next step of our analysis was to
estimate the rates of mental health services use among
those with lifetime pure anxiety, those with pure
depressive disorders, and those with both disorders.
As shown in Table 1, mental health services utilization
was the highest among those with both disorders
(26.5%), compared to those with pure anxiety (10.6%)
and with pure depression (18.2%).
Psychological Distress and Mental Health
Services. The next step of our analysis was to
compare the level of psychological distress among
adolescents who had received any mental health
services with that of adolescents who had not received
such services. We compared differences between these
groups of adolescents (i.e., with and without mental
health services) using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Group membership (adolescents with
anxiety or depression, with or without mental health
services) was used as independent variable, and
psychological distress, as measured by the SCL-90-R,
was the dependent variable.
Results showed that among adolescents with anxiety
disorders, those who sought mental health services,
compared to those without any treatment, had
significantly higher scores on psychological distress,
asmeasuredusingtheSCL-90-R.AsshowninTable3,
anxiety cases that received mental health services
compared to those that did not receive such services
had significantly higher scores on the global severity
index [(1, 156)58.08, Po.01], and on the following
subscales of the SCL-90-R: obsessive–compulsive
behavior [F(1, 159)55.80, Po.05]; interpersonal
sensitivity [F(1, 159)511.20, Po.01]; depression
[F(1, 159)513.75, Po.001]; anger–hostility [F(1,
159)56.48, Po.05]; paranoid ideation [F(1, 159)5
17.37, Po.001]; and psychoticism [F(1, 159)57.99,
Po.05].
Similar results were also obtained for adolescents
with depressive disorders; that is, those who received
mental health services had significantly higher scores
on the global severity index [(1, 153)57.74, Po.01],
and on the various SCL-90-R subscales compared to
depressed adolescents who did not use mental health
services: interpersonal sensitivity [F(1, 156)510.78,
Po.001]; depression [F(1, 156)59.96, Po.001];
anxiety [F(1, 156)54.84, Po.05]; paranoid ideation
[F(1, 156)55.19, Po.05]; and psychoticism [F(1,
