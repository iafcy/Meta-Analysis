Background:In Latin America, there is limited research on the prevalence of mental disorders in
children and adolescents. This Chilean survey is the first national representative survey in the Latin
American region to examine the prevalence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) psychi-
atric disorders in the region in children and adolescents. Methods:Subjects aged 4–18 were selected
usingastratifiedmultistagedesign.TheDiagnosticInterviewScheduleforChildrenversionIV(DISC-IV)
was used to obtain 12-month DSM-IV diagnoses of affective, anxiety, conduct and substance use dis-
orders,andsupplementedwithquestionnairesexaminingfamilyriskfactors,familyincome,andservice
utilization. The parent or the primary caretaker was interviewed for children, aged 4–11, using the
DISC-IV; however, adolescents, aged 12–18, were directly interviewed. Results: A sample of 1558
children and adolescents was evaluated. Using the most stringent DISC-IV impairment algorithm, the
prevalence rate for any psychiatric disorders was 22.5% (19.3% for boys and 25.8% for girls). The
