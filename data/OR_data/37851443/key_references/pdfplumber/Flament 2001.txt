ABSTRACT
Objective:To compare phenomenology, psychosocial correlates, and treatment seeking in DSM-III-Rmajor depression
and dysthymia among adolescents diagnosed as cases in a community-based study.Method:A self-report questionnaire,
including psychosocial data, life events, eating behaviors, depressive symptoms, substance use, pathological behaviors,
and family and school functioning was administered to a nonselected sample (N= 3,287, 93.2% of targeted population) of
adolescents aged 11 to 20 years from several Haute-Marne communities in France in 1988–1989.Subgroups of subjects
(n= 205, 84.7% of eligible subjects) were interviewed with a structured diagnostic schedule, and adolescents with major
depression (n= 49), dysthymia (n= 21) and controls (n= 135) were compared.Results:Nearly 30% of controls had at
least one current symptom of depression.Patterns of affective symptoms were similar in major depression and dysthymia,
but significant differences emerged in comorbid conditions (more anxiety disorders, suicidal behaviors, and alcohol intoxi-
cations associated with major depression) and stressor at onset (more severe in major depression).Experiences of loss
during the prior 12 months were associated with both forms of affective disorder, while poor family relationships were spe-
cific correlates of dysthymia.In contrast, peer relationships and pathological behaviors did not differ between depressed
subjects and controls.Although psychosocial functioning was significantly impaired in both groups of depressed adoles-
cents, treatment seeking was limited to 34.7% for major depressive subjects and 23.8% for dysthymic subjects.
Conclusion:The results provide evidence that major depression and dysthymia in adolescence are equally severe but may
have distinct patterns in associated factors.Despite free access to health care, the rate of treatment seeking for mood dis-
orders in France is similar to that reported in U.S.studies.J.Am.Acad.Child Adolesc.Psychiatry, 2001, 40(9):1070–1078.
