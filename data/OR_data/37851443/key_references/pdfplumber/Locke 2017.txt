Abstract
BACKGROUND—We examined racial/ethnic disparities in school-based behavioral health
service use for children with psychiatric disorders.
METHODS—Medicaid claims data were used to compare the behavioral healthcare service use of
23,601 children aged 5–17 years by psychiatric disorder (autism, attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), conduct/oppositional defiant disorder, and “other”) and by race/ethnicity
(African-American, Hispanic, white, and other). Logistic and generalized linear regression
analyses were used.
RESULTS—Differences in service use by racial/ethnic group were identified within and across
diagnostic groups, both for in-school service use and out-of-school service use. For all disorders,
Hispanic children had significantly lower use of in-school services than white children. Among
children with ADHD, African-American children were less likely to receive in-school services
than white children; however, there were no differences in adjusted annual mean Medicaid
expenditures for in-school services by race/ethnicity or psychiatric disorders. Statistically

significant differences by race/ethnicity were found for out-of-school service use for children with
ADHD and other psychiatric disorders. There were significant differences by race/ethnicity in out-
of-school service use for each diagnostic group.
CONCLUSIONS—Differences in the use of school-based behavioral health services by racial
and ethnic groups suggest the need for culturally appropriate outreach and tailoring of services to
improve service utilization.

How race/ethnicity affects school-based behavioral health service use is poorly
understood.1–5 Many minority youth with psychiatric disorders do not receive needed
behavioral health services, perhaps because of their and their families’ interpretation of
symptoms, beliefs about the most appropriate responses, and poor access to specialty
care.1, 6–10 One way to improve access and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in service use is
to provide behavioral health services in schools.6 Public schools have become the main
provider of behavioral health services to children in the United States (US) and are
responsible for approximately 70–80% of all behavioral health services delivered to
children.11–14 Schools provide convenient access to behavioral health services and
significantly reduce barriers to treatment seen in traditional outpatient settings, particularly
in ethnic minority groups15–17
The increase in schools’ provision of behavioral health services resulted from new education
policies mandating that supports be given to children with psychiatric disorders,18 new
federal funding initiatives,19 and that disparities in service use based on socio-economic
status, race, and ethnicity must be eliminated.12 Currently, 32 states leverage Medicaid funds
to provide school-based services. Despite an improved policy environment and increased
funding, some research indicates that approximately half of children with developmental
conditions (autism, developmental delay and intellectual disability) lack easy access to
school-based services, and 17% do not have an individualized education plan.20
While school-based services hold promise for decreasing racial/ethnic disparities by
improving access, there has been little comparison of service use by racial/ethnic group
between school-based services and more traditional outpatient behavioral health services.
More importantly, while many studies have demonstrated racial/ethnic disparities in access,
diagnosis, and outcomes in youth with various psychiatric disorders,5–7, 21 none, to our
knowledge, has directly compared racial/ethnic disparities by psychiatric diagnosis between
school-based and other behavioral health services. Understanding how disparities in school-
based behavioral health service use differ across race/ethnicity and psychiatric disorders will
potentially point to the ways in which schools may differentiate care to address unmet
behavioral health needs. It may be that for some disorders, providing school-based
behavioral health services increases access to behavioral health services for children who
otherwise would not receive care. If racial/ethnic disparities are similar across disorders, it
suggests the need for global interventions to reduce them. However, if racial/ethnic
disparities differ by disorder, it may suggest the need for more targeted strategies to

determine why they exist and how to address them. The purpose of this study was to
compare in-school and out-of-school behavioral health service use and associated Medicaid
expenditures among ethnic minority children with different psychiatric disorders. All
students were from the same school district, were Medicaid enrolled and had equal access to
behavioral health services at their schools leveraged through Medicaid.
METHODS
Data Source and Study Sample
The study sample included 23,601 Medicaid-enrolled children between 5–17 years of age
who used behavioral health services between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009.
Medicaid claims data were used. The sample represents the entire population of Medicaid-
enrolled youth in Philadelphia who used behavioral health services.
Variables
Psychiatric disorder was defined as having a diagnosis in the Medicaid claims of autism,
conduct disorder/oppositional defiant disorder (conduct/ODD), attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or a different disorder (other psychiatric disorders).
Diagnoses were identified using the International Classification of Diseases (9th ed., ICD-9).
Children with 2 or more Medicaid claims that indicated primary diagnosis of: (1) 299.xx
were identified as having autism; (2) 312.xx or 313.xx were identified as having conduct/
ODD; and (3) 314.xx were identified as having ADHD. Other psychiatric disorders included
affective mood disorder, substance abuse, schizophrenia, and other psychiatric diagnoses.
We focused on these disorders because: (1) most children served through the public mental
health system are diagnosed with either ADHD or disruptive behavior disorders;22 and (2)
autism is the developmental disorder with the most rapidly increasing prevalence, is
expensive to treat, and often requires care in school.23 Less than 5% of study participants
had more than one diagnosis. Consistent with previous studies, children who met study
criteria for more than one diagnosis were classified in the hierarchy of autism, ADHD,
conduct/ODD and other psychiatric disorders.23
In-school behavioral health service use was defined as receiving in-school individual
behavioral services (one-on-one behavioral support) during the school day. Out-of-school
behavioral services were defined as receiving outpatient treatment in a specialty mental
health setting or out-of-school Behavioral Health Rehabilitation Services (BHRS). BHRS is
Pennsylvania’s version of wraparound services, designed to provide therapeutic intervention
to children aged 3–21 years with serious emotional disturbance, social, or behavioral
problems in the least restrictive environment maintaining the child in his/her natural
setting.24 Both in-school behavioral health services and out-of-school BHRS require the
same level of clinical necessity, which is more intensive care than outpatient care.24 Children
who are Medicaid beneficiaries and meet clinical necessity through psychiatric evaluation
have equal access to both types of services. Our definition of non-school services did not
include acute services such as crisis center visits and inpatient psychiatric hospitalization
and restrictive care such as psychiatric residential treatment. Unadjusted and adjusted mean
Medicaid expenditures for each type of service were calculated for each race/ethnic group

by psychiatric disorder. Demographic variables included sex (male vs. female) and race/
ethnicity (African-American, white, Hispanic including both white and African-American,
and other).
Data Analysis
Chi-square tests were used to test for differences in demographic characteristics and
behavioral health service use by psychiatric disorder. In-school individual behavioral health
service use and out-of-school behavioral health service use were not mutually exclusive.
Logistic regression analyses were used to identify children’s in-school and out-of-school
behavioral health service use (the dependent variables) by race/ethnicity and psychiatric
disorder adjusting for age and sex. Two logistic regression analyses were performed for each
type of service use: (1) significant difference test of service use by race/ethnicity within each
psychiatric disorder; and 2) significant difference test of service use by race/ethnicity across
psychiatric disorders. The 2 models were used to identify if: (1) differences in service use
exist by race/ethnicity within each psychiatric disorder group; and (2) within-group
differences in service use by race/ethnicity significantly differ across psychiatric disorders.
For the Medicaid expenditures analyses, unadjusted annual mean Medicaid expenditures by
race/ethnicity, psychiatric disorder, and service type among users were calculated.
Generalized linear models with a gamma distribution and log link function were used to
compare differences in the expenditures for in-school and out-of-school behavioral health
service use by race/ethnicity and psychiatric disorder, adjusting for age and sex. Two
generalized linear regression analyses were performed for Medicaid expenditures for each
type of service use testing: (1) significant differences in Medicaid expenditures by race/
ethnicity within each psychiatric disorder; and (2) significant differences in Medicaid
expenditures by race/ethnicity across psychiatric disorders.
RESULTS
The most common psychiatric diagnosis was ADHD (39.9%); 35.2% were diagnosed with
other psychiatric disorders, 21.3% with conduct/ODD, and 3.6% with autism (Table 1). The
majority (63.0%) of the sample was male and about half (49.4%) was aged 5–11 years. Sex
and race/ethnicity distributions significantly differed by psychiatric disorder. Whereas only
16.0% of children with autism were girls, 33.4% of children with conduct/ODD, 28.1% of
children with ADHD and 51.4% of children with other psychiatric disorders were girls. The
proportion of African-American children was the highest among children with
conduct/ODD (76.1%), followed by other psychiatric disorders (61.3%), autism (51.4%) and
ADHD (50.5%). The majority of Hispanic children was diagnosed with ADHD (39.8%),
followed by other psychiatric disorders (25.4%), conduct/ODD (16.5%) and autism (15.2%).
In-school and Out-of-school Behavioral Health Service Use
Tables 2 and 3 present significance tests in service use by race/ethnicity within each
psychiatric disorder and within-group disparities in service use by race/ethnicity across
psychiatric disorders. There were significant differences by race/ethnicity in use of in-school
behavioral health services. For each diagnosis group, Hispanic children were less likely to

use in-school behavioral health services than White children (Table 2). They were 49% less
likely for autism (p = .002); 48% less likely for conduct/ODD (p = .039); 55% less likely for
ADHD (p < .001); and 50% less likely for other psychiatric disorders (p = .039). For the
ADHD group, African-American children were 62% more likely than white children with
ADHD to use in-school individual behavioral health services (p < .001). The lower use of in-
school service among Hispanic children compared to white children was similar across all
psychiatric disorders. Disparities in in-school service use between African-American and
white children were found only for the ADHD group (p = .02).
The analysis of out-of-school behavioral health service use showed significant differences
by race/ethnicity within the ADHD group and the other psychiatric disorders group (Table
3). African-American children with ADHD were 58% less likely than white children with
ADHD to use out-of-school behavioral health services (p = 0.002). Hispanic children with
ADHD were 91% more likely than white children with ADHD to use out-of-school
behavioral health services (p = .043). Hispanic children with other psychiatric disorders
were 79% more likely than white children with other psychiatric disorders to use out-of-
school behavioral health services (p = .036). The racial/ethnic differences did not differ by
psychiatric disorder.
Medicaid Expenditures for In-school and Out-of-school Behavioral Health Service Use
As Figure 1 shows, the unadjusted annual mean Medicaid expenditures for in-school
individual behavioral health service use ranged from $4,768 for Hispanic children with
ADHD to $7,846 for white children with conduct/ODD. With the exception of children with
autism, in-school behavioral health Medicaid expenditures for white children was the
highest followed by the expenditures for African-American and Hispanic children. The
unadjusted Medicaid expenditures for in-school behavioral health service use by psychiatric
disorder was the highest for children with autism, and ranged from $6273 for Hispanic
children to $7280 for African-American children. Despite the differences in the unadjusted
Medicaid expenditures, the age and sex adjusted mean Medicaid estimates for in-school
individual behavioral health service use were not significantly different by race/ethnicity
within each psychiatric disorder or across psychiatric disorders.
As Figure 1 shows, the unadjusted annual mean Medicaid expenditures for out-of-school
behavioral service use ranged from $1169 for Hispanic children with ADHD to $4462 for
African-American children with autism. The unadjusted Medicaid expenditures for out-of-
school behavioral health services were the highest for African-American children for all
psychiatric disorder groups, followed by white children and Hispanic children. The adjusted
mean Medicaid expenditures for out-of-school behavioral health service use reflected the
pattern of unadjusted expenditures by race/ethnicity within and across psychiatric disorder
groups; the disparities in service use between Hispanic and white children and between
African-American and white children were significantly different by psychiatric disorders.
Compared with white children, the adjusted mean Medicaid estimates for out-of-school
behavioral health service use for Hispanic children were 0.72 times lower for autism (p = .
003), 0.72 times lower for conduct/ODD (p < .001), 0.62 times lower for ADHD (p < .001),
and 0.72 times lower for other psychiatric disorders (p < .001). The adjusted mean Medicaid

estimates for African-American children with ADHD were 24% higher than those for white
children with ADHD (p < .001) and 10% higher for African-American children with other
psychiatric disorders compared to white children with other psychiatric disorders (p = .010).
The differences in the adjusted mean expenditures between Hispanic and white children and
between African-American and white children significantly differed across psychiatric
disorder (p = .045 and p = .032, respectively).
DISCUSSION
The observed disparities in use of in-school services are particularly important and have
direct implications for improving access to care for ethnic minorities. The results indicated
that many Hispanic children with psychiatric disorders were not using in-school behavioral
health services. These differences were not observed when comparing expenditures among
users, suggesting that once children access in-school behavioral health services, they use a
similar amount of service. The literature suggests that there may be important cultural
differences among Hispanics in accessing one-to-one school based care.25, 26 Delphin-
Rittmon et al27 found that Hispanics reported stigmatizing views about seeking behavioral
health services and only used care in crisis situations or as a last resort. Furthermore, studies
have shown that Hispanic families may view teachers and school personnel as having a great
deal of power and authority over their child’s education and may trust that their children
already receive adequate supports in school.28, 29 Research also has shown that Hispanic
parents often stress the importance of both behavior and academics within education30 and
may assume the educational system is addressing their child’s behavioral needs without the
need of additional services. Therefore, Hispanic families may be hesitant to request
additional school support services for their children if the school does not indicate a need for
these services. Whereas the process of obtaining services may be complicated for both in
and out of school services, research suggests that language barriers may likely present some
unique challenges for families that are Spanish-speaking only, as applying for services may
require both an understanding of legal rights and a mastery of the English language.31
Spanish speaking only families may be at a significant disadvantage, and there is some
research that suggests many undocumented families may be fearful of advocating for
additional services for their child.32 Culturally responsive efforts to improve the rates at
which Hispanic families of children with psychiatric disorders gain initial access and
enrollment in school-based behavioral health services are needed in order to reduce this
disparity and improve access to care. Schools may need to consider adopting targeted
outreach services for Hispanic families who may benefit from school-based behavioral
health services.
Additionally, Hispanic children with ADHD and other psychiatric disorders had
significantly higher use of out-of-school services than white children with these same
diagnoses; however, their associated expenditures were significantly lower than those of
white children. This finding suggests that the disparity in out-of-school service use relates to
dosage or intensity, as opposed to access as observed for in-school service use.
Unlike Hispanic children, African-American children with ADHD were more likely to use
in-school behavioral health services and less likely to use out-of-school services than white

children with ADHD. This finding has several potential explanations. First, it is possible that
many African-American children with autism are incorrectly diagnosed with ADHD,33
which may inflate the service use observed among children diagnosed with ADHD in this
sample. Previous research has demonstrated that children from different racial/ethnic groups
are assigned psychiatric diagnoses at different rates,34 with African-American children being
much more likely to receive an ADHD diagnosis before being diagnosed with autism.33
Differences in diagnostic labels across racial/ethnic groups may contribute to creating a
group of African-American children diagnosed with ADHD who have intensive in-school
service needs. Second, it is possible that African-American children who demonstrate
externalizing behavior problems often associated with ADHD are more likely to be referred
for in-school services by their teachers, as has been demonstrated in previous reports of
disproportionalities in school-based referrals to special education and behavioral support
services.35–36 Whereas more accurate and refined diagnostic assessments and referrals to
service for African-American children may be needed,37 future research to determine what
factors may explain higher in-school service use for African-American children with ADHD
is needed. It also is possible that African-American children with ADHD use more intensive
in-school behavioral health services to address their needs and more research is needed to
understand if this is a factor.
Limitations
The study had several limitations. First, the geographic generalizability of the results is
limited to the areas with similar racial/ethnic diversity and behavioral health services for
children with psychiatric disorders; however, the findings may be generalizable to the large,
urban school districts that serve a disproportionately large number of minority children and
children with special needs.37 Second, the study was conducted using the Philadelphia
behavioral health Medicaid claims data and does not take into account the potential role of
other funding streams (the education system, private insurance, and out of pocket). Although
these data are important for understanding one population of behavioral health users,
additional research is needed to understand service use by different providers. Third, it was
not possible to ascertain the linguistic backgrounds of the families from this dataset and
whether accessing services was impacted by language skills; although, it is likely that
language barriers may affect families’ procurement of services. Fourth, although all children
had equal access to in-school individual behavioral health support through Medicaid, it was
not possible to ascertain whether the schools also provided other behavioral health services
such as counseling or medication management. Fifth, the difference in Medicaid
expenditures across race/ethnic groups reflects the difference in volume of service use and
does not reflect differences in quality of care. We did not have data to examine quality of
services rendered in either in-school or out-of-school settings. Lastly, our analysis is based
on one year of cross-sectional data of behavioral health claims. Additional research that
includes the analysis of physical health and prescription claims combined with the
behavioral health claims are likely to provide more meaningful racial/ethnic disparity
information, as children might be prescribed medication for their behavioral symptoms
through pediatricians and may not be identified as needing behavioral health services,
thereby inflating the out of school to in school service ratio.

IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL HEALTH
This is one of the first studies to examine disparities in in-school and out-of-school
behavioral health services and Medicaid expenditures across psychiatric diagnoses and race/
ethnicity. The results suggest that significant disparities in in-school individual behavioral
health service use exist by race/ethnicity and differ across psychiatric disorders.
Additionally, significant disparities in Medicaid expenditures for out-of-school behavioral
health service use by race/ethnicity exist and significantly differ across psychiatric disorders.
There is a distinction between not using available services and not having access to needed
services, which suggests the need for different types of interventions to reduce racial/ethnic
disparities in the behavioral health system and schools. In this study, Hispanic children used
the lowest amount of behavioral health Medicaid services across all diagnostic groups. The
reasons for this disparity are unclear; however, the results indicate a large proportion of
Hispanic children with psychiatric disorders that are being underserved, particularly in
school settings. These data suggest that merely changing the setting in which services are
delivered does not completely address existing disparities. In fact, school-based services
may be necessary but not sufficient in ameliorating disparities among Hispanics. This
disparity points to the need for culturally sensitive methods and targeted outreach services to
inform Hispanic families of the critical need for intervention, as well as the need to
concurrently implement interventions that are consistent with and sensitive to the cultural
beliefs and practices of Hispanic families. Future research on how the higher use of in-
school behavioral health service among African Americans with ADHD compared to other
children with ADHD is associated with school outcomes as well as behavioral functioning
will lead policymakers and practitioners to identify whether higher use is associated with
better quality of in-school behavioral healthcare. Cultural awareness may affect assessment,
diagnosis, and treatment3 resulting in disparities in access to and utilization of services
among students with psychiatric disorders. Training behavioral health practitioners to
provide culturally appropriate assessment and services will help alleviate disparities among
all ethnic groups. Finally, tailoring in-school behavioral health service to be culturally
appropriate by psychiatric disorder is important to reduce disparities in use.
