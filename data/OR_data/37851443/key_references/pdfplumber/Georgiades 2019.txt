disorder classification was based on youth report (43.7%).
Childrenwithcomorbidmood/anxietyandbehaviourdisor-
ders were most likely to have service contacts. Although
rates of any service contact were similar for pure mood/
anxiety and pure behaviour disorders identified in youth
(12 to 17 years) by parents or youth (49.6% versus 51.4%
and39.9%versus39.7%),thiswasnotthecaseamongchil-

group were 66.3% for pure behaviour and 44.6% for pure
mood/anxiety. This difference was largely attributable to
school-based services where rates of service contact were
59.3%forpurebehaviourand31.9%forpuremood/anxiety
disorders.
Amongyouth,ratesofservicecontactfrommentalhealth
and general health care providers were similar (33.7% and
35.1%forparent-reporteddisorderand22.3%and24.4%for

11 years), 25.6% and 35.6% saw mental health and general

tively. The most common setting or sector for mental
