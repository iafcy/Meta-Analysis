in a university-affiliated primary care clinic. Families were recruited from a
pediatric patient list and 714 families participated in an initial study wherein
they completedchildanxietyquestionnaires.According toparentand childself-
report questionnaires (n¼714), 22% and 20% of children, respectively, were
above a suggested clinical cutoff on a brief anxiety screen; 19% and 14% of
children exceeded clinical cutoffs on aseparate social anxietyquestionnaire. All
families were invited to participate in a second study that included the Anxiety
Disorders Interview Schedule for Children-Parent Version and questions about
treatment utilization; telephone interviews with 190 parents showed 1-year

phobia, 6.8% (se¼1.8%) for social phobia, 3.2% (se¼1.3%) for generalized
anxiety disorder, 0.5% (se¼ .7%) for selective mutism, 1.6% (se¼ .9%) for
major depressive disorder, 1.1% (se¼ .7%) for dysthymia, and 12.6%
(se¼2.4%) for attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Among
children with a current anxiety disorder, 31% had received counseling or
medication treatment during their lifetime, compared to 40% of children with
depression and 79% with ADHD. Adolescent age and being Caucasian were
predictors of psychotherapy use; having an ADHD diagnosis was a predictor of
both psychotherapy and medication use. The high prevalence of impairing
anxiety disorders, in concert with the very low extent of treatment utilization,
suggests a need for methods to identify and disseminate empirically validated
treatments for these disorders in the primary care setting. Depression and
