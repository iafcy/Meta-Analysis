Allowing for this effect, there was no link between
parental nonparticipation and the gender or age of
the child.
A substantial number of parents invited to take part
in the second phase did not reply even though they
had participated in the first phase. This nonparticipa-
tion did not seem to be influenced by their child_s

parent questionnaires. Among the screen-positive
children whose parents were invited into the second
