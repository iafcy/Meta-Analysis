ABSTRACT
Objective:Todescribetheuseofmentalhealthandsubstanceabuseservicesbychildrenandadolescents asreported
from the four community sites included inthe NIMH Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental
Disorders (MECA) Study. Method: As part of the MECA survey, questions were developed to identify children and
adolescents utilizing mental health and substance abuse services. Youths aged 9 through 17 years and a parent/
caretaker were interviewed. Because the investigators had concerns about the capacities ofthe younger children in
the study to describe their use of mental health services, more extensive questions were asked of parents than of
youths. Results: The procedures developed bythe MECA project identified patterns ofservice usethat varied inthe
fourcommunities surveyed. Agreement between reportsofparentsandyouths regardingtheuseofmentalhealthand
substance abuse services showed substantial inconsistencies, similar to reports of psychiatric disorders. At three of
thefoursites,themajorityofchildrenmeetingcriteriaforapsychiatric disorderandscoring60orlessontheChildren's
