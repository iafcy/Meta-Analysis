Abstract
Background: The Galilee Study assessed mental health service needsamongIsraeli Muslim and Druze adolescents
and their mothers. Studies showthatmothers ofadolescents belonging to the Arab minority have much lower
help-seeking rates than Jewish mothers. This paper examinesmothers’structural and cultural barriers to help-
seeking.
Methods: All 9th grade students living in5 towns representative of Muslim and Druze localities innorthern Israel,
were eligible for the study and 1639 (69.3%) obtained parental agreement and participated. Emotional or behavioral
problem were assessed inthe classroom using theStrengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. A total of 704
adolescent-mother dyads participated in thefollow-up, and were interviewed at home, using the Development and
Well Being Assessmentinventory, theCompositeBarriers to Help-Seeking Questionnaire, the General Health
Questionnaire −12, the Subjective Feelings of Discrimination Index and socio-demographic questions.Pearson χ2
testand multivariate binarylogistic regressions were performed to analyze mothers’ consultation rates byrisk
factors. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to identifyunderlying factors and assess construct validity of the
Composite Barriers to Help-Seeking Questionnaire, and also meanscores and standard deviations for thedistinct
scales were calculated.
Results: More mothers of adolescents witha mentaldisorderthan those without a mentaldisorderconsulted a
professional or school source (39.7%vs. 20.5%; χ2=45.636; p=<0.001). The most important barriers to help-seeking
were those related to “Accessibility”,followed by barriers related to the belief that “Treatment is detrimental”and to
thepossibility of“Reprisal by authorities”. Barriers related to “Stigma” and “Distrust of professionals”had thelowest
means scores. Differences by ethnicity/religion were found.
Conclusions: Structural barriers related to lack ofaccess, were considered themain obstacleto help-seeking inthis
Israeli Arab minority population.Cultural barriers such as stigma were consideredof secondary importance.
Structural barriers could be reduced byincreasing the number of accessible public mental health clinics inthe
minority localities,a responsibilityof the Ministry ofHealth and theHMOs. Informationcampaigns and
psychoeducation for parents would help reduce otherbarriers to mentalhealth treatment.
