Abstract
Objective—The aim of this study was to examine racial/ethnic differences in fifth grade
children’s mental health care utilization.
Methods—We analyzed cross-sectional data from a study of 5147 fifth graders and their parents
in 3 US metropolitan areas from 2004–06. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine
racial/ethnic differences in mental health care utilization.
Results—Nine percent of parents reported that their child had ever used mental health care
services; fewer black (6%) and Hispanic (8%) children had used services than white children
(14%). Fewer black and Hispanic children with recent symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, and fewer black children with
symptoms of depression had ever utilized services compared with white children. In multivariate
analyses controlling for demographic factors, parental mental health, social support, and
symptoms of the 4 mental health conditions, we found that black children were less likely than
white children to have ever used services (Odds ratio [OR] 0.3, 95% confidence interval [95% CI],
0.2–0.4, P <.001). The odds ratio for black children remained virtually unchanged when the
analysis was restricted to children with symptoms of ≥1 mental health condition, and when the
analysis was stratified by mental health condition. The difference in utilization for Hispanic
compared with white children was fully explained by sociodemographics in all multivariate
models.

Conclusions—Disparities exist in mental health care utilization for black and Hispanic children;
the disparity for black children is independent of sociodemographics and child mental health need.
Efforts to reduce this disparity may benefit from addressing not only access and diagnosis issues,
but also parents’ help-seeking preferences for mental health care for their children.
Keywords
mental health; racial/ethnic disparities; utilization
National and community studies have found racial/ethnic differences in mental health care
utilization for children and adolescents;1–6 these studies suggest that black and/or Hispanic
children are less likely than white children to receive mental health care services. Other
studies document significant variation in parental help-seeking behaviors for different child
mental health conditions.2,7,8 Most data on racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care
utilization, however, only account for general child mental health need.2,3,5,6 Few studies
provide a comparative examination of racial/ethnic disparities in utilization for specific
mental health conditions. One study of specialty mental health care use found that black
children were less likely than white children to receive specialty care for depression but
were just as likely to receive specialty care for behavioral problems.1 Data on condition- or
symptom-specific racial/ethnic disparities in utilization could help researchers and clinicians
focus their efforts in reducing these disparities in mental health care use. We know of no
published population-based studies that examine how primary and specialty mental health
care utilization differs by child race/ethnicity among children with symptoms of each of the
most common childhood mental health conditions. Therefore, our study aims to examine
racial/ethnic differences in 1) the utilization of mental health care in children, and 2) the
utilization of mental health care among children with symptoms of 4 of the most common
psychiatric diagnoses in children—attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), and depression. We
hypothesize that 1) significant racial/ethnic disparities exist in mental health care utilization
that are more pronounced among children with ADHD and less apparent among children
with depression and that 2) socioeconomic factors will explain the observed racial/ethnic
differences in utilization. These racial/ethnic differences will be examined using the
Andersen model of health care utilization as a conceptual framework;9 thus, predisposing
factors (ie, age, race/ethnicity), enabling factors (ie, income, insurance) and need factors (ie,
mental health symptoms) may influence and contribute to child mental health care
utilization.
METHODS
Healthy Passages, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a
longitudinal study of a cohort of 5147 fifth graders and their parents that explores health
behaviors, outcomes, and related risk and protective factors by using a multilevel approach.
Baseline data collected from 2004 to 2006 were used for this analysis. Institutional review
boards at each study site and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved this
study. “Healthy Passages” provides a comprehensive assessment of preadolescent health and
behavior by using baseline data from multiple sources (child, parent, and school).

Psychometrically sound standardized measures were used when feasible. Qualitative (ie,
focus groups, cognitive interviews) and quantitative studies were conducted during study
development, pretesting, and pilot testing to evaluate the appropriateness of survey
language, translation, field procedures, and language-specific study materials; these are
detailed elsewhere.10
Study Population and Sampling Procedure
Participants were recruited from public schools located in 3 areas: 1) 10 contiguous public
school districts in and around Birmingham, Alabama, 2) 25 contiguous public school
districts in Los Angeles County, California, and 3) the largest public school district in
Houston, Texas. Eligible schools had an enrollment of at least 25 fifth graders, representing
over 99% of students enrolled in regular classrooms in the 3 areas. To ensure adequate
sample sizes of black, Hispanic, and white students, we used a 2-stage probability sampling
procedure. In the first stage, we randomly sampled schools by using probabilities that were a
function of how closely a school’s racial/ethnic mix corresponded to the site’s racial/ethnic
target. In the second stage, all fifth grade students in regular classrooms of sampled schools
were invited to participate. The small number of students who were not identified as black,
Hispanic, or white were categorized as “other” for sampling purposes only. The sampling
procedure is detailed elsewhere.10
The 118 sampled schools had 11 532 enrolled fifth graders. Almost all students in regular
classrooms were eligible to participate; the only exclusion criterion was if the child or
primary caregiver was unable to complete the study interview in English or Spanish. A
primary caregiver (henceforth referred to as “parent”) for each student received a letter
requesting permission for contact by study personnel. Of the 11 532 parents—6663 who
either agreed to be contacted or who were unsure but were invited to participate—77%
(5147) completed an interview. This sample size reached the predetermined sample size
targets, which were designed to allow detection of small effects within racial/ethnic
subgroups. Details of statistical power are described elsewhere.10 Interviews were conducted
at the parent’s home, study center, or another preferred location. Prior to interviews, parents
gave informed consent for their participation and their child’s participation; children gave
assent.
Measures
Mental Health Care Utilization—To measure mental health care utilization, we adapted
one set of questions from the Services Assessment for Children and Adolescents, a self- and
parent-report instrument designed to assess the use of outpatient and inpatient mental health
services by children aged 8 to 18 years.11 The Services Assessment for Children and
Adolescents shows good concordance (κ = 0.76) between parent reports and documentation
for services.12
Parents were asked, “Has your child ever received care for emotional, behavioral, drug, or
alcohol problems?” Parents were also asked where their child received that care and could
answer with one or more of the following: a) pediatrician, family doctor, medical clinic,
general hospital, or other medical provider; b) psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric nurse,

clinical social worker, other mental health professional in a mental health clinic or office; or
c) school counselor, school psychologist, or other school mental health worker.
Although our utilization measure is lifetime service use for emotional, behavioral, drug, or
alcohol problems, it likely provides information on more recent utilization (previous 3 years)
since the age of the children is 10 to 11 years. National studies demonstrate that ≤3% of
children <8 years old have ever used mental health care services or have a significant mental
health condition.5,13 Further, since the prevalence of drug and alcohol use was extremely
low among the “Healthy Passages” fifth grade participants (eg, 2% reported ever using
marijuana; <1% reported ever using other drugs), most reported utilization was likely for
emotional and behavioral problems.
Child Mental Health Symptoms—We adapted 32 questions from the Diagnostic
Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) Predictive Scales (DPS) to assess the presence of
parent-reported symptoms of ADHD (8 yes/no items), ODD (12 yes/no items), CD (8 yes/no
items), and child-reported symptoms of depression (6 yes/no items) during the previous 12
months. The DPS is a screening tool based on the DISC; it identifies children with
symptoms of 11 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition
diagnoses (sensitivities and specificities for ADHD, ODD, CD, and depression ≥ 0.89).14
We created dichotomous variables for each disorder, defined by a score (sum of symptoms)
above the sample 90th percentile. We used this cutoff value, which was more stringent than
cutoff values used in a previously studied community sample,14 since we did not include
impairment or severity measures for symptoms.
Covariates—We collected data on several child and parent characteristics previously
hypothesized to influence child and adult mental health care use.1,5,6,15–18 Child
sociodemographic covariates included child race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic black, Hispanic,
non-Hispanic white, other race/ethnicity), age (≤10 years, ≥11 years [93% were 10 or 11]),
gender, insurance status (uninsured, insured), annual household income (<$20 000, $20
000–$69 999, ≥$70 000), and household composition (2-parent, 1-parent, other). Parent
sociodemographic covariates included parent age (18–34 years, 35–44 years, ≥45 years),
education level (no high school degree, high school degree/some college, college degree or
greater), and English language proficiency (speaks English very well vs less than very
well;19 monolingual English speakers were categorized as English proficient). Insurance
categories (private insurance, Medicaid, State Children’s Health Insurance Program) were
dichotomized into insured and uninsured, because bivariate analyses showed no significant
differences by insurance type. Parent age and income were categorized based on differences
observed in mental health care utilization in bivariate analyses. Lastly, we also included
covariates for parental psychological distress, parental social support, and child symptoms of
ADHD, ODD, CD, and depression. We omitted parent gender because 93% were female.
Parents completed the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI 18), a validated tool to identify adult
psychological distress.20 Global distress scores were dichotomized using published cutoff
values validated in community samples.21

Two subscales from the 10-item Social Well-Being Scale determined the number of social
contacts (3 items) and social resources (1 item) available to parents.22 These questions asked
about the frequency of visits with friends and the number of close friends/relatives with
whom the parent feels at ease.22,23 Total scores were calculated for each subscale and used
as continuous variables.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses employed design and nonresponse weights and accounted for both the effects of
weights and of the clustering of children within sites by using Stata SE 10 (StataCorp LP,
College Station, Tex).24–26 First, we used chi-square tests of homogeneity, t tests, and
logistic regression to describe the characteristics of children using mental health care. We
also used bivariate analyses to describe the proportion of children with mental health
symptoms by child race/ethnicity and mental health care utilization among them. Next, we
used multiple logistic regression to examine the adjusted odds ratios of mental health care
utilization in 4 separate models for children with symptoms of 1) ADHD, 2) ODD, 3) CD,
and 4) depression. Finally, we examined these odds ratios in multiple regression models that
1) included all children, regardless of symptoms, and 2) were restricted to children with a
mental health care need as determined by having symptoms of ADHD, ODD, CD, or
depression.
All multiple regression models included the following covariates: child age, gender, and
health insurance; parent age, educational attainment, English proficiency, social contacts/
resources, and psychological distress; household composition and income; and study site.
The model that examined utilization for all children also included child mental health need
(symptoms of ADHD, ODD, CD, or depression). Due to low missing-item rates among the
covariates used (mean 1.3%), we used subgroup (school) mean imputation for covariates to
avoid the bias that arises with list-wise deletion of complete cases in multivariate models.27
We did not perform imputation for our main dependent or independent variables (ie, mental
health care utilization, mental health symptoms).
RESULTS
Characteristics of All Children Using Mental Health Care
Nine percent of fifth graders had received care at some time in their lives for emotional,
behavioral, or drug/alcohol problems (Table 1). Of these, 71% received care from mental
health specialists (psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric nurse, clinical social worker, other
mental health professional/specialist), 20% used school services only (school counselor,
school psychologist, or other school mental health worker), and 9% received care from a
primary care provider only (pediatrician, family doctor, medical provider). Data are not
shown. A larger percentage of white (14%) than black (6%) or Hispanic (8%) children had
ever used mental health care. There were no significant differences in utilization by parental
psychological distress or social contacts/resources. In contrast to children with recent
symptoms (during the past 12 months) of depression (16%), more children with recent
symptoms of ADHD (30%), ODD (28%), and CD (27%) were reported by their parents to
have used mental health services at some time. Of those with a mental health need as

determined by symptoms of ≥1 of the 4 mental health conditions, 68% had symptoms of 1
disorder, 20% had 2, 11% had 3, and 1% had all 4 (data not shown).
Racial/Ethnic Differences in the Prevalence of Mental Health Symptoms
Bivariate analyses showed significant differences in parent-reported symptoms of ADHD,
ODD, and CD across race/ethnicity. Hispanic children were less likely to have symptoms of
ADHD (7%), ODD (5%), and CD (5%), compared with white children (10% ADHD, 10%
ODD, 9% CD), whereas black children were more likely to have ADHD (14%) and CD
symptoms (13%) than white children. There were no significant differences in the report of
depressive symptoms by race/ethnicity (Table 2).
Mental Health Care Utilization by Race/Ethnicity and Mental Health Condition
We found significant differences in utilization among children with symptoms of ADHD,
ODD, and CD. Forty-nine percent of white children with ADHD symptoms had ever used
mental health care, compared with 20% of black, 26% of Hispanic, and 45% of other
children. Results were similar for ODD and CD. Black (9%) children with depressive
symptoms had much lower utilization than white (28%) children (Table 3). In each of 4
condition-specific multivariate models, black children with symptoms of ADHD, ODD, CD,
and depression were less likely than white children to have ever used mental health services.
There were no significant differences for Hispanic or other children compared with white
children (Table 4).
Multivariate Analysis of Mental Health Care Utilization Among All Children
In a multivariate model of all children, black children (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2–0.4, P < .001)
were less likely to have ever used services compared with white children, but the odds ratio
for Hispanic children compared with white children was not significant (Table 5).
Study site, parental education, household composition, and parental English language
proficiency were associated with mental health care utilization in the multivariate model
(Table 5). Children with symptoms of each of the mental health conditions were more likely
to have ever used services compared with those without. The odds ratio was greatest for
children with ADHD symptoms (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.8–5.1, P < .001) when compared with
children who did not have ADHD symptoms. Odds ratios for children with symptoms of
ODD (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5–2.9, P < .001), CD (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4–2.8, P < .001), and
depression (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2–2.6, P = .004) were also significant but lower in magnitude.
Multivariate Analysis of Mental Health Care Utilization Among Children with Symptoms
In a multivariate logistic model that only considered children with symptoms of ≥1 mental
health condition, black children (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2–0.4, P < .001) with symptoms were
less likely to have ever used care than white children with symptoms (Table 5). The odds
ratio for Hispanic compared with white children was not significant.

DISCUSSION
Our findings suggest that there is a significant and robust disparity in mental health care
utilization for black children, which cannot be fully explained by racial/ethnic differences in
child mental health, family sociodemographics, or parental social factors. This disparity
persists even when just considering those children with symptoms of a mental health
condition. It also exists in similar magnitude across all 4 examined mental health conditions.
We did not find a disparity in utilization between Hispanic and white children in
multivariate analyses.
Our findings are consistent with other studies of racial/ethnic disparities in utilization,
although unlike our study, some studies have also reported disparities for Hispanic children.
Researchers analyzing 1987 data found that black and other nonwhite children were less
likely to receive ambulatory mental health care compared with white children.6 In another
study using 1996 to 1998 data, researchers found that black and Hispanic children were less
likely to use specialty mental health care.5 After controlling for sociodemographics, unmet
need for primary or specialty care was significantly lower for Hispanic children, but not
black children, compared with white children. A study using a more recent national dataset
(2000) found that black and Hispanic children were less likely than white children to have a
mental health care specialty visit, after controlling for a number of covariates, including
need.1 In contrast, the “Great Smoky Mountains Study” of youth (1992–1993), a
longitudinal, community-based study in western North Carolina, did not find any significant
differences in utilization among black and white youth.28 One reason that we did not find a
disparity for Hispanic children may be that we included a number of covariates that seemed
to explain the unadjusted difference in utilization between Hispanic and white children. For
example, none of these studies included a variable to account for English language
proficiency in multivariate analyses.
In unadjusted analyses, fewer black and Hispanic children with symptoms of ADHD, ODD,
and CD, and fewer black children with symptoms of depression had ever utilized services
compared with white children. A previous study found that black and Hispanic children
were less likely to have a specialty visit for depression when compared with white children.1
More broadly, our findings suggest that many children (of all racial/ethnic categories) who
experience depressive symptoms do not receive primary and specialty mental health care
services.
In a multivariate model, we found that site, parent education, parent English proficiency, and
household composition were positively associated with mental health care utilization.
Children in households other than a 2-parent household were more likely to have used
services. In a previous study, presence of a father in a household decreased the likelihood of
child mental health care utilization.1 The authors hypothesized that fathers may be less
amenable to utilizing mental health care for mental health problems in their children,
although other factors may have influenced utilization. Our finding that children in
households without 2 parents were more likely to have ever used mental health care than
those in 2-parent households may suggest that help seeking for mental health problems

differs by household composition, or that children in these “other composition” households
have additional mental health care needs that we did not measure (eg, adjustment problems).
The differences in utilization between black and white children were not explained by
sociodemographics, parental support, parental mental health, or child mental health
symptoms. It is possible that the disparity is a result of cultural differences in mental health
care utilization that we were unable to account for in this analysis. Researchers have
hypothesized that cultural differences in parental help-seeking preferences may be
responsible, in part, for racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care utilization.2,7 Although
our findings do not suggest a differential response to mental health symptoms by parent
race/ethnicity, other studies have found racial/ethnic differences in parents’ threshold for
seeking care based on child symptoms.2,8,29 In one study, black parents were less likely than
white parents to contact mental health care professionals as their first step in help seeking
for their child’s problem behaviors. The correlation between professional help seeking and
perceived severity of the child’s behavior was greater for blacks than for Hispanics and
whites, suggesting that black parents may have a higher threshold for child symptoms before
they seek professional help.2,7 This higher threshold could be a result of cultural differences
or differences in access to care.
Although we accounted for mental health need by assessing recent symptoms of 4 mental
health conditions, we were unable to account for parental perceived need. Cultural
differences in parents’ perceived need for mental health care, and preferred help-seeking
behavior when a mental health need is perceived, may partially explain the black-white
disparity in utilization. These cultural differences have been explored for ADHD. For
example, dosReis and colleagues30 and Olaniyan and colleagues31 found that some black
parents perceived ADHD symptoms as behaviors that are better addressed by parenting and
discipline than by medical and mental health professionals. Bussing and colleagues32,33
found that black parents were less likely than white parents to prefer medication treatment
for ADHD. There are still other factors that we did not measure that could account for the
black-white disparity, including difficulty accessing mental health care services despite
insurance, parental perceived discrimination by the health care system, or parental distrust of
mental health professionals.
There are limitations to this study. First, our results are based on data collected from 3 major
metropolitan areas in 3 different states and may not generalize to other areas or the US
population as a whole. Second, in our multivariate model for utilization, we only account for
recent (last 12 months) mental health symptoms, but our main outcome measure of
utilization is lifetime mental health care use for any mental health problems. Because of this
discrepancy, our estimates of utilization accounting for mental health needs could be
overestimated. Further, for children who did use care, we do not have information on the
type, duration, or adequacy of treatment received. Next, although we can account for recent
symptoms of mental health disorders, we did not assess parents’ perceptions of mental
health care needs for their children. Further, we only collected data (including parent-
reported child symptoms) from 1 parent for each child and do not have similar data from the
other parent in 2-parent households. Lastly, our measures of mental health symptoms do not
include functional impairment, which is necessary for diagnosis.34

Despite these limitations, our findings have implications for child mental health policy and
practice. There is a significant and robust disparity in utilization for black children compared
with white children that was not explained by the need, predisposing, or enabling factors
that we explored. This disparity existed for all examined mental health conditions in similar
magnitude and may be a result of cultural differences in the recognition or perception of
mental health problems or in parents’ help-seeking preferences. Efforts to reduce these
disparities for black children should focus on educating parents about common child mental
health conditions and their treatment options and investigating cultural factors that may
shape parents’ help-seeking preferences for mental health symptoms in their children.
