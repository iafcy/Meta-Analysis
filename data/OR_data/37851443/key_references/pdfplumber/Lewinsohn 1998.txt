TREATMENT OF ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION:
FREQUENCY OF SERVICES AND IMPACT ON
FUNCTIONING IN YOUNG ADULTHOOD
Peter M. Lewinsohn, Ph.D.,* Paul Rohde, Ph.D., and John R. Seeley, M.S.
In this report, we (a) present descriptive information about the extent and the
kinds of treatments being provided to depressed adolescents; (b) identify the
factors that are related to treatment utilization; and (c) examine whether the
provision of treatment during adolescence reduced the risk for the occurrence
of depression during young adulthood (19–24 years). The sample consisted of
1,507 randomly selected high school students who were diagnostically assessed
on two occasions with an interval of approximately one year; 627 were assessed
a third time when they reached the age of 24. The findings may be summa-
rized as follows: 60.7% of those with major depressive disorder were provided
with treatment. The modal treatment was outpatient, individual psycho-
therapy administered by a mental health provider. Inpatient treatment and
medications were rare. Factors found to be related to treatment utilization
were the severity of the depression, the existence of a comorbid nonaffective
disorder, the number of previous episodes of depression, history of suicide at-
tempt, academic problems, lack of intact family, and female gender. Unexpect-
edly, those who had received treatment were not less likely to relapse into
another episode of depression during young adulthood. Depression and Anxi-
