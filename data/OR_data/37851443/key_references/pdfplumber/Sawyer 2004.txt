ABSTRACT
Objective:Toexamineuseofhealth(includingpsychiatric)andschool-basedservicesbychildrenandadolescentswho
met symptom criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the factors associated with service use, and
barrierstoserviceaccess.Method:Therelationshipbetweenparents’perceptionsofchildren’sneedforprofessional

andschool-basedservices,39%hadattendedonlyhealthservices,and20%hadattendedonlyschool-basedservices.
Sixty-nine percent of parents attending health services wanted additional help. Parental perceptions that children
neededprofessionalhelp,children’sfunctionalimpairment,theimpactofproblemsonparents,andcomorbiddepressive
or conduct disorders had a significant and independent relationship with service use. Conclusions: A minority of
childrenandadolescentswithADHDsymptomatologyreceivesprofessionalhelpfortheirproblemsinAustralia.Coun-
seling is the most frequent help provided, with many parents wanting additional help beyond that already provided.
