Socio‑demographic, clinical and risk differences
between healthy adolescents and adolescents

Significant group differences were found for adolescents
without lifetime mental health problems and the clini-
cal sample with respect to sex, age, family status, chronic
physical or mental illness within the family, and the history
of a traumatic life event (see Table 4). The clinical sample
showed a higher percentage of female patients compared
to students without a full-syndrome psychiatric disorder,
who were older, lived more often with a single parent, had
a higher percentage of chronic physical illness and mental
illness within the core family, and were more often exposed
to traumatic life events such as abuse and violence. In
comparison with the school sample with a full-syndrome
psychiatric disorder, the clinical sample revealed a higher
percentage of mental health problems within the family.
