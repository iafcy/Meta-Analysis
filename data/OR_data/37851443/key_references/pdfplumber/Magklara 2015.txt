Abstract
Background: Depression is a common mentalhealth problem in adolescents worldwide.The aim of the present
study was to investigate theprevalence, comorbidity and sociodemographic and socioeconomic associations of
depression and depressivesymptoms,as wellas therelevant health servicesuse ina sampleof adolescents in
Greece.
Methods: Five thousand six hundred fourteen adolescents aged 16–18 years old and attending25 seniorhigh
schools were screenedand a stratified random sampleof 2,427 were selected for a detailed interview. Psychiatric
morbidity was assessed with a fully structured psychiatric interview, therevised Clinical InterviewSchedule (CIS-R).
The use ofsubstances, such as alcohol, nicotine and cannabis,and several sociodemographic and socioeconomic
variables have been also assessed.
Results: Inoursampletheprevalencerateswere5.67%forthedepressiveepisodeaccordingtoICD-10and17.43%

comorbid anxiety disorder [OR: 7.76 (5.52-10.92)]. Only 17.08 % of the adolescents with depression have visited a
doctor due to a psychological problem during the previous year. Anxiety disorders, substance use, female gender,
older age, having one sibling, and divorce or separation of the parents were all associated with depression. In
addition, the presence of financial difficulties in the family was significantly associated with an increased
prevalence of both depression and depressive symptoms.
Conclusions: Prevalence and comorbidity rates of depression among Greek adolescents are substantial. Only a
small minority of depressed adolescents seek professional help. Significant associations with financial difficulties
are reported.
