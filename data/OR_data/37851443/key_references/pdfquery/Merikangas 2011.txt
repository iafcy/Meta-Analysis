Objective—Mental health policy for youth has been constrained by a paucity of nationally 
representative data concerning patterns and correlates of mental health service utilization in this 
segment of the population. The objectives of this investigation are to examine the rates and 
sociodemographic correlates of lifetime mental health service use by severity, type, and number of 
DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A). 
Method—Face-to-face survey of mental disorders from 2002-2004 using a modified version of 
the fully-structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview in a 
nationally representative sample of 6,483 adolescents aged 13-18 years for whom information on 
service use was available from both an adolescent and a parent report. Both total and sector- 
specific mental health service use was also assessed. 
Results—Approximately one-third of adolescents with mental disorders received services for 
their illness (36.2%). Although disorder severity was significantly associated with an increased 
likelihood of receiving treatment, half of adolescents with severely impairing mental disorders had 
never received mental health treatment for their symptoms. Service rates were highest among 
those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (59.8%) and behavior disorders (45.4%), but 
less than one in five affected adolescents received services for anxiety, eating, or substance use

disorders. Comorbidity and severe impairment were strongly associated with service utilization, 
particularly among youth with behavior disorders. Hispanic and non-Hispanic black adolescents 
were less likely than their white counterparts to receive services for mood and anxiety disorders, 
even when such disorders were associated with severe impairment. 
Conclusions—Despite advances in public awareness of mental disorders in youth, a substantial 
proportion of young people with severe mental disorders have never received specialty mental 
health care. Marked racial disparities in lifetime rates of mental health treatment highlight the 
urgent need to identify and combat barriers to the recognition and treatment of these conditions. 



Despite the availability of effective mental health treatments1, current evidence suggests that 
only a minority of youth with mental disorders receive mental health care2-5. This broad and 
disconcerting inference is supported by several community epidemiological surveys of U.S. 
youth that have found that only one-fourth to one-half of youth with mental disorders 
receives professional services. In particular, prior work has indicated that youth are most 
likely to receive treatment for attention deficit- hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)6 and other 
disruptive behavior disorders7, and least likely to be treated for 
anxiety5, 8.Sociodemographic correlates of service utilization include gender5, 9-14, age15, 
parental educational level16, 17, family size10, family structure9, 10, availability of health 
insurance9, and ethnic minority status7, 9, 10, 12, 18. These surveys which have helped to 
inform federal and state mental health policy have sampled young people who reside in 
specific local geographic regions4, 9-11, 15, 18, 19 and are therefore not nationally 
representative. The lack of a national data base on the prevalence, correlates, and service 
patterns for childhood mental disorders in the U.S. remains a major impediment to the 
refinement of federal and state mental health policies to reduce the burden of childhood 
mental disorders.20 
Several limitations characterize the existing data on mental health treatment patterns of 
adolescents in general and among U.S. adolescents in particular. First, although a large 
number of community studies have examined rates and correlates of service use among 
youth meeting criteria for specific disorders7, 21-24 or for any type of psychiatric 
problem4, 10, 18, 19, 25, 26, only a few studies5, 8, 14 have investigated variation of service use 
across a broad range of psychiatric disorders. Second, while research has demonstrated that 
many youth receive mental health services outside of the specialty mental health treatment 
sector4, 7, 14, 18, 19, very few studies have examined rates of service use across these sectors. 
Finally, few prior studies have included sufficient numbers to investigate sex and ethnic 
differences in mental health service patterns. The present study examines data from the 
National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A)27-30, a nationally- 
representative sample of U.S. adolescents using direct interviews to assess a broad range of 
emotional and behavioral disorders. 



The goals of the present paper are to: (1) estimate lifetime service use across service sectors 
for specific DSM-IV mental disorders; (2) examine associations of severity, comorbidity, 
and number of classes of lifetime mental disorders with service use; and (3) identify 
sociodemographic correlates of lifetime service use among youth with mental disorders. 


The NCS-A is a nationally-representative face-to-face survey of 10,148 adolescents aged 
13-18 years in the continental U.S.5, 27 The survey was administered by the professional 
interview staff of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. The 
background, measures, design, and clinical validity of the NCS-A are described by 
Merikangas et al27 and Kessler et al28, 29. Briefly, the NCS-A sample was based on a 
nationally representative household sample (n=904 adolescents) and a school sample 
(n=9,244 adolescents), with a combined response rate of 82.9%. Parents (or parent 
surrogates) of adolescents were mailed a self-administered questionnaire (SAQ) that was 
developed for the survey. The SAQ collected additional information on adolescent 
sociodemographic characteristics, developmental background, mental and physical health, 
service use, and other family- and community-level factors 27. The SAQ conditional 
response rate was 82.5-83.7% in the household and school samples. This study focuses on 
the subsample of 6,483 adolescent-parent pairs for whom data were available from both the 
adolescent interview and the parent SAQ. This subsample was used because several key 
elements of service utilization were only collected from one informant (e.g., lifetime number 
of mental health outpatient visits was present only in the SAQ, whereas disorder-specific 
service was only collected in the adolescent diagnostic interview). A sample weight was 
specifically calculated for this subsample to ensure that it was nationally representative with 
respect to weighting variables such as sex, age, race/ethnicity, family income, urbanicity, 
and CIDI/DSM-IV disorder estimates from the NCS-A full sample27-29. Written informed 
consent was obtained from parent and adolescent participants. Each respondent was given 
$50 for participation. These recruitment and consent procedures were approved by the 
Human Subjects Committees of Harvard Medical School and University of Michigan. 
Sociodemographic factors—Socio-demographic variables assessed in the NCS-A 
include age, sex, race/ethnicity, parental marital status, parent education, urbanicity, and 
geographic region. The 2000 census definitions were used to code urbanicity by 
distinguishing large metropolitan areas from smaller metropolitan and rural areas. About 
half of the sample was male (51.3%) and the mean age was 15.9 years. The sample was 
comprised of 65.6% non-Hispanic White, 15.1% non-Hispanic Black, and 14.4% Hispanic 
adolescents. A great majority (85.5%) had parents who had completed at least high school, 
more than two-thirds (69.5%) of the sample lived with currently married or cohabiting 
parents, 15.5% had parents who were separated, divorced or widowed, and 3.4% of the 
sample lived with single parents. 




Diagnostic assessment—Details of the diagnostic and risk factor measures are 
described by Merikangas et al.27, and lifetime prevalence rates are reported by Merikangas 
et al30. Briefly, adolescents were administered a modified version of the World Health 
Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview Version 3.0 (CIDI), a 
fully structured interview administered by trained lay interviewers to generate DSM-IV 
diagnoses29. The major classes of lifetime disorders assessed in the CIDI included mood 
disorders, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], behavior 
disorders (oppositional defiant disorder [ODD] and conduct disorder [CD]), substance use 
disorders, and eating disorders. Parents reported information on selected disorders. 
Impairment criteria embedded in DSM-IV required endorsement of some/a lot/extreme 
levels of impairment or moderate/severe/very severe levels of symptom severity. Our 
definition of severe lifetime disorders used higher thresholds of impairment that required 
endorsement of “a lot” or “extreme” impairment in daily activities, or “severe or very 
severe” distress. Severe emotional disorders required both distress and impairment to be 
present. Because distress was not assessed for behavior disorders, severe behavior disorders 
(ODD or CD) and ADHD required severe or very severe levels of impairment as well as 
endorsement of symptom criteria (i.e., the appropriate number of symptoms for each 
respective disorder) by both the parent and the adolescent. Parallel severe lifetime eating and 
substance use disorders were not created because variations in levels of impairment and 
distress for these disorders were not available5. 
Although service use was included as an index of impairment in deriving DSM-IV 
diagnoses, this criterion was removed from the diagnostic algorithms for the purposes of 
these analyses. Additionally, indices of disability assessed solely for 12-month disorders 
were not considered in defining lifetime disorder severity. For the present analyses, we 
created a summary variable of the number of classes of DSM-IV non-severe and severe 
disorders (0, 1, 2, 3+ classes of disorders). 
Immediately following questions related to diagnostic criteria in each disorder interview 
module, respondents were asked whether they ever received disorder-specific treatment. In a 
separate interview module focusing on services, all respondents were asked whether they 
had ever received service for emotional or behavioral problems and the settings in which 
they had received these services. Reports of service use were classified into the following 
categories: 1) Mental health specialty: a psychiatrist in settings such as a mental health 
clinic, drug or alcohol clinic, and admissions to hospitals and other facilities; 2) General 
medical: service provided by a general practitioner, family physician, pediatrician, any other 
physician, and emergency room service; 3) Human services: a counselor, a religious/ 
spiritual advisor, or mental health crisis hotlines; 4) CAM: support groups, self-help groups, 
or any other healer; 5) Juvenile justice: probation officer or juvenile correction officer; 6) 
School services: special school/class for emotional or behavioral problems, school nurse, 
school counseling, and school medication. We also examined the number of sectors in which 
youth had received treatment for specific mental disorders. In addition to these qualitative 
categories, services were examined according to the number of visits made to mental health 




outpatient facilities (e.g,, community mental health center or drug/alcohol clinic), and to 
mental health professionals (e.g., psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or family 
counselor) in their lifetime. The number of lifetime visits was categorized as frequent (>20 
visits), intermediate (6-20 visits) and limited (<6 visits). 
Parents also reported about their child's treatment for emotional or behavior problems using 
similar questions to those administered in the adolescent diagnostic interview. The analysis 
of service use in this paper was based on endorsement by the parent or adolescent. Levels of 
agreement between parent and adolescent report for any mental health treatment (κ=.58, s.e. 
= .0001) and for any service use (κ=.54. s.e. = .0001) were both acceptable. The service 
questions for adolescents and parents were primarily derived from the Service Assessment 
for Children and Adolescents (SACA). Validity of parent and child reports on the SACA are 
reported by Stiffman et al31. 

The data were weighted to adjust for the differential probability of selection of respondents 
within the school and household samples, for differential non-response, and for residual 
differences between the subsample and the full NCS-A sample as well as the U.S. 
population on the cross-classification of socio-demographic variables29. Cross tabulations 
were used to calculate treatment estimates. Logistic regression analyses were used to 
examine demographic correlates of disorder-specific treatment. In order to examine the 
predictors of lifetime treatment contact, each model was estimated separately among 
respondents with a disorder in each of five major diagnostic classes. Logistic regression 
models included all sociodemographic correlates simultaneously, and adjusted odds ratios 
are presented. Correlates included: age, sex, race/ethnicity, region, urbanicity, parental 
marital status, parental education, poverty index ratio, and number of classes of disorders (0, 
1, 2, or 3 or more of the 5 classes). Multivariate significance tests were calculated using 
Wald Chi-Square tests based on coefficient variance-covariance matrices that were adjusted 
for design effects using the Taylor series method. Statistical significance was based on two- 
sided design-based tests evaluated at a 0.05 level of significance. 


Table 1 displays the rates of disorder-specific service use among adolescents with DSM-IV 
mental disorders by sex and age group. Approximately one third (36.2%) of adolescents 
with any mental disorder received treatment for a particular lifetime disorder. Adolescents 
with behavior disorders had the highest rates of disorder-specific treatment, with 59.8% of 
adolescents with ADHD and 45.4% with ODD or CD receiving treatment for their 
respective disorders in their lifetime. Of adolescents with mood disorders, 37.7% received 
disorder-specific treatment, while a more modest portion of adolescents with anxiety 
(17.8%), substance use (15.4%), and eating disorders (12.8%) received treatment. There was 
a direct association between the number of classes of disorder affecting youth and their rate 
of service use. Whereas approximately only 20% of adolescents with one class of disorder 



received treatment, 51.0% of those with two classes of disorder, and 72.2% of those with 3 
or more classes of disorder received services. 
Among adolescents diagnosed with any disorder, sex and age had minimal impact overall on 
the rates of service use across all disorders. However, some specific disorders had greater 
discrepancies. For panic disorder, females were nearly three times more likely to receive 
treatment than were males (50.1% vs. 14.3%, χ21=13.5, p=0.0002), and the female-to-male 
service use ratio for eating disorders was greater than nine-to-one (17.0% vs. 1.8%, χ21=9.8, 
p=0.008). Conversely, males were more likely than were females to receive treatment for 
ADHD (64.8% vs. 44.6%, χ21=14.1, p=0.0002). Overall, treatment for anxiety disorders 
tended to increase with age, with 13.2% of the 13-14 year olds and 25.0% of the 17-18 year 
olds receiving disorder-specific treatment for an anxiety disorder (χ22=8.5, p=0.014). 
Although variations in treatment prevalence across age were evident for specific subtypes of 
anxiety disorders, none of these differences across age groups reached statistical 
significance. 
Table 2 displays the comparison of service use by the severity status of the psychiatric 
disorder. Overall rates of service use among adolescents with severe DSM-IV disorders 
were significantly higher than those seen among adolescents with non-severe DSM-IV 
disorders (26.1% vs. 47.4, p<.0001). There were significant increases in the proportion of 
youth with mental health service use among those with anxiety disorders, ADHD, and ODD 
or CD, but the differences in service use for youth with severe versus non-severe mood 
disorders were negligible. Patterns of service use by sex and age varied little across severe 
disorders, with one exception: the higher rate of services received by males relative to 
females with ADHD was not observed among adolescents with severe ADHD (80.8% 
males; 85.0% females, χ21=0.74, p=0.226) (results not shown but available upon request). 

Table 3 displays the multivariate associations between socio-demographic characteristics 
and seeking treatment within each disorder class. Females were more likely than males to 
receive treatment for anxiety disorders, while the reverse was true for ADHD. Increasing 
age was also associated with treatment of anxiety disorders. Ethnic/racial minorities had 
lower treatment rates than did non-Hispanic whites for several classes of disorder: (1) 
Hispanics were less likely to receive treatment for mood and anxiety disorders; (2) non- 
Hispanic Blacks were less likely to receive treatment for mood disorders; and (3) and other/ 
multiracial ethnic youth were less likely to receive treatment for anxiety and ADHD. 
In terms of family characteristics, parental marital status significantly predicted treatment 
among adolescents with mood or substance use disorders, with higher rates of treatment 
among adolescents whose parents were previously married relative to adolescents of married 
or cohabitating parents. Adolescents whose parents did not complete high school or college 
were more likely to receive services for substance use disorders, and adolescents were less 
likely to receive treatment for these conditions if they lived in the South as compared to the 
West. No association was observed between urbanicity or poverty level and disorder- 
specific services in these multivariate analyses. However, the number of comorbid classes 



was strongly associated with service use for mood, anxiety, ODD or CD, and substance use 
disorders. 
Correlates of mental health service use for severe disorders were generally similar to those 
for DSM-IV disorders with respect to age, sex, parental marital status, and number of classes 
of disorders. However, Hispanic youth were less likely than non-Hispanic White youth to 
receive services for severe ADHD, whereas there were no significant differences in mental 
health services for non-severe ADHD by ethnicity. Two-way interaction terms were derived 
from demographic and clinical correlates that exhibited significant associations with 
disorder-specific service use within each DSM-IV disorder class. After controlling for 
multiple testing with a Bonferroni correction, four interactions were significantly associated 
with service use: 1) race/ethnicity and urban/rural residence for mood disorders: rural Blacks 
were less likely than were rural Whites to receive treatment for mood disorders, whereas 
there were no differences in services by ethnicity among youth who resided in urban areas; 
2) ethnicity and number of classes of disorder for mood disorders: there was a greater 
increase in service use by the number of classes of disorders among Hispanic youth 
compared to those of other races/ethnicities; 3) sex by ethnicity for anxiety disorders: White 
males had significantly more treatment for anxiety disorders than did males of other ethnic 
backgrounds; 4) parental marital status and number of classes of disorders for substance use 
disorders: there was a greater increase in treatment rates by the number of classes of 
disorders in youth with divorced parents relative to youth with married parents. There was 
no significant interaction of sex and race/ethnicity when examining the probability of getting 
treatment for mood disorders, behavior disorders, ADHD, or substance use disorders. When 
the reported severity of disorder was included in the models predicting service use, we found 
that severity predicted service use for the class of anxiety disorders (OR=2.56, 95% CI: 
1.60-4.11), ADHD (OR=3.47, 95% CI: 1.29-9.30), and behavior disorders (OR= 5.33, 95% 
CI: 3.74-7.58), but not for mood disorders. Further, the effect of race/ethnicity and its 
interaction with sex on service use for anxiety disorders persisted after controlling for the 
severity of anxiety disorders. There was no three-way interaction between severity and sex 
and race/ethnicity for service use for any disorder class (results not shown but available 
upon request). 

Table 4 displays the rate of any lifetime services (rather than disorder-specific services) by 
the type of service sectors across each class of DSM-IV psychiatric disorder. Among 
adolescents with any class of disorder, most were seen in the mental health specialty service 
sector (46.5%) or in the school setting (35.4%). The pattern of services by sector was largely 
consistent across disorder classes. Services within each sector increased as a function of 
number of classes of disorder. Among all adolescents receiving services, 37.9% received 
services from only one sector, followed by 28.6% from two sectors, 20.3% from three 
sectors, and 13.2% from four or more service sectors (results not shown but available upon 
request). Analyses of demographic and clinical predictors of specialty mental health service 
use revealed that youth with ADHD were 2.69 times as likely to receive mental health vs. 
other services (95% C.I., 1.94 – 3.72), after controlling for demographic characteristics, 
specific classes of disorders, and the number of classes of disorders. Not shown, non- 



Hispanic Blacks and other ethnic groups were significantly less likely to receive mental 
health services than their White counterparts. 
Table 4 presents the prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals for the number of 
lifetime service visits with a health professional by the specific classes of mental disorders 
and the number of classes. The majority (68.4%) of those with mental disorders had limited 
service contacts (i.e., less than 6 visits), whereas 16.2% reported intermediate visits (i.e., 
6-20 visits), and 15.5% reported frequent visits (i.e., greater than 20 visits). With some 
variation, this pattern was consistent both across the type and the number of classes of 
disorder. The proportion of frequent service use increased as the number of classes of 
disorder increased, 7.3% for those with one class, 21.6% for those with 2 classes, and 35.6% 
for those with 3 or more classes. 
The right side of Table 4 presents the adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for 
the associations between the number of service visits and disorder classes. The most robust 
effects were observed for behavior disorders. As is shown, ADHD was the only disorder that 
was significantly associated with more frequent service contacts (OR = 2.38, 95% C.I., 1.33 
- 4.27), and similarly but conversely, ADHD was also significantly associated with limited 
or minimal service contacts (OR = 0.52, 95% C.I., 0.31 - 0.87). Youth with conduct disorder 
were also significantly less likely to have limited service contacts (OR = 0.58, 95% C.I., 
0.36 - 0.95), after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., sex, age, race/ 
ethnicity, parent marital status, parent education, region, urbanicity, and poverty index 
ratio), specific classes of disorders, and the number of classes of disorders. 
With regard to sociodemographic correlates of the number of service visits, significant 
associations were observed for several individual- and family-level characteristics. 
Concerning individual characteristics, females were less likely than were males to receive 
frequent services (OR = 0.68, 95% C.I., 0.47 - 0.98), and similarly, Hispanics and non- 
Hispanic Blacks were significantly less likely than were Whites to receive frequent services 
(OR = 0.68, 95% C.I., 0.47 - 0.98). In terms of family-level characteristics, youth of parents 
who were previously married had a higher likelihood of more frequent service visits (OR = 
1.95, 95% C.I., 1.38-2.75), whereas youth residing in the Northeast (OR =0.56, 95% C.I., 
0.34-0.92) or Midwest (OR =0.79, 95% C.I., 0.64-0.97) had a lower likelihood of 
intermediate service visits relative to youth residing in the West (results not shown but 
available upon request). 

Results of the current study show that most youth with mental disorders do not receive 
mental health treatment for their symptoms. The treatment gap is especially pronounced for 
anxiety5, 8, 21 and substance use disorders. Among adolescents with mood disorders, 
Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks were much less likely than were Whites to report having 
received mental health treatment, and a similar pattern was observed for Hispanic youth 
with anxiety disorders. Although psychiatric comorbidity and disorder severity increased the 
probability of receiving treatment, roughly one in two adolescents with comorbid and 
severely impairing mental disorders had never received mental health treatment for their 



symptoms. Over the past several years, a number of public health efforts have sought to 
increase access to mental health treatment for young people with psychiatric disorders. The 
State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP)32, which subsidizes mental health 
services33, has expanded access to care for low income and previously uninsured youth. 
Likewise, over the past two decades, the federal Children's Mental Health Initiative has 
developed dedicated systems of care for young people with serious emotional disturbances 
in nearly 150 communities nationwide34. Voluntary national screening programs have also 
been initiated to enhance detection and mental health referral of adolescents with psychiatric 
disorders35. Despite these and other policy reforms, it is striking that the rates of mental 
health treatment are not markedly higher than those of studies including youth of 
comparable age groups conducted several years ago, though methodologic differences 
cannot be ruled out 4, 12, 15. A more recent nationally representative survey of 12-month 
disorders in a broader age group with stricter diagnostic thresholds yielded somewhat higher 
service rates than those of this more comprehensive study5, half of the children with 
severely impairing disorders still did not receive professional service. These patterns raise 
serious concern over the slow pace of progress in extending mental health service provision 
for American youth with mental disorders. The fact that these rates are similar to those of 
adults with mental disorders also suggests widespread deficiencies in the provision of early 
mental health care36. 
Among adolescents with mood and anxiety disorders, racial/ethnic minority groups tended 
to receive lower rates of treatment than their White counterparts. This pattern confirms and 
extends results from prior studies of adults 37-41 and youth3-5, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 42, 43 in the U.S. 
Although eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care is a well established and 
widely pursued national public health goal44, substantial racial/ethnic disparities persist in 
the treatment of the internalizing disorders. In contrast with externalizing conditions, which 
are often recognized and addressed due to behaviors observed in school or other public 
settings, services for mood and anxiety disorders may require self-recognition or close 
observation by family members. Given these differences in service initiation across broad 
types of disorder, the lower rates of treatment for internalizing disorders among ethnic 
minorities may be especially pronounced due to concerns over stigma, perceived lack of 
culturally-competent or effective services, or financial barriers to service access10, 11, 18, 42. 
Vigorous and sustained efforts are required to increase awareness of mood and anxiety 
disorders in minority communities, combat stigma, broaden the assessment skills and 
cultural competence of front line clinicians, and expand the access and capacity of mental 
health services. 
Treatment rates of ADHD were proportionately greater than those of other disorder 
groups6, 14, 45. Among youth with ADHD, however, adolescent boys were significantly 
more likely than girls to receive treatment. Similar service patterns have been described in 
elementary school children46, 47. The reasons for gender differences in treatment seeking for 
ADHD are not yet known, though several hypotheses have been proposed. A gender gap in 
treatment has been attributed to greater impairment 48 and more disruptive behaviors49, 50 in 
boys relative to girls with ADHD. It has also been suggested that disproportionately higher 
rates of the inattentive subtype51 or other less easily recognized clinical presentations52 of 
ADHD among girls compared to boys may account for this treatment pattern. Alternatively, 



parents and teachers may perceive that pharmacological53 or psychosocial54 ADHD 
treatments are less effective in girls versus boys. The current findings underscore the 
importance of identifying and seeking to eradicate gender-related barriers in the community 
treatment of ADHD. The prominent role of school-based services in the treatment of ADHD 
suggests that such efforts should include a focus on improving school-based identification 
and referral of girls with ADHD. 
Consistent with previous research, disorder severity was strongly correlated with mental 
health treatment.4, 10, 12 The highest lifetime rates of treatment were reported among youth 
with severe ADHD and other behavior disorders. This suggests that aggressive, impulsive, 
and disruptive behaviors tend to drive or attract mental health care treatment seeking of 
adolescents. Also consistent with earlier research7, psychiatric comorbidity, which is a crude 
measure of illness complexity, was strongly related to treatment. 
Among adolescents who receive mental health treatment, a substantial proportion reported 
receiving relatively few visits. Although the data do not permit an assessment of treatment 
effectiveness, the fact that roughly one half of youth with ADHD, behavior disorders, and 
substance use disorders received six or fewer lifetime outpatient mental health visits 
suggests that many youth with high service needs may not receive adequate care. A general 
tendency for youth with ADHD to receive more intensive outpatient care than youth with 
other disorders may relate to the early onset of ADHD and the effectiveness of stimulants 
and other pharmacological treatment in ameliorating inattention, impulsivity, and 
hyperactivity55. 
The specialty mental health sector was the dominant locus of mental health care. This 
portrait contrasts with an earlier epidemiological study of a rural population in which 
schools were the primary mental health treatment setting2. In that study, school-based 
mental health care was more than four times more common than specialty mental health 
sector care2. In the current study, school-based mental health care was an important 
treatment setting, especially in the care of ADHD and other behavior disorders19, though the 
specialty mental health care was more common for each disorder group. In contrast with UK 
studies of adolescents14 and U.S. studies of adults36, care from general medical 
professionals does not equal or exceed care from mental health specialists among U.S. 
adolescents. The traditional pathway from primary mental health care to specialty mental 
health care, which is central to the delivery of adult mental health services56, may be 
comparatively less well-traveled by youth. In order to better understand common service 
paths of children and adolescents, it will be important to clarify the sequence of health care 
settings and the role of referral patterns, service availability, child and family preferences, 
professional competencies, financial considerations, and other factors that shape mental 
health care treatment pathways for adolescents. 
The NCS-A offers several strengths for evaluating mental health service patterns. The large 
sample size yields sufficient power to examine correlates of service use among several 
ethnic minority subgroups. The interview collected extensive information on services 
including the full range of service sectors from the perspectives of both the parent and the 
youth. It also provides the first data on lifetime service use in a representative sample of 



U.S. youth that supplements our recent study of 12-month disorders in a broader age range 
of youth5. However, the current analysis also has several limitations. First, the NCS-A 
under-represents several segments of the adolescent population including those who are not 
enrolled in school, are homeless, or do not speak English. The absence of these subgroups 
likely reduces disorder prevalence rates, particularly among older adolescents29. Second, the 
cross-sectional methodology precludes analysis of time trends as well as longitudinal 
predictors of service use. Third, discrepancies in reported service use between parents and 
adolescents may have led to unreliable estimates of service contacts and correlates. Unlike 
claims data or other more objective measures of service use, respondent recall of services is 
susceptible to error and social desirability bias. Fourth, no information was available 
concerning health care insurance which is likely an important determinant of service use. 
Fifth, data collection occurred in 2002-2004; however, important changes in community 
mental health treatment patterns may have occurred in the interim following increases in 
pharmacological treatments and ensuing safety concerns in youth57. 
Widespread gaps in mental health care of youth with severe mental disorders pose serious 
challenges to public health planners and policy makers. Many youth with mental disorders, 
even severe and impairing disorders, have never received treatment for their conditions. 
Among those who have received care, treatment is often quite limited. Racial disparities in 
mental health care of mood and anxiety disorders pose especially urgent mandates for 
action. Despite calls over the past decade for comprehensive and accessible community- 
based mental health services for youth and families, particularly minority youth14, 
substantial unmet needs for care persist. National shortages of mental health specialists for 
children remain widely prevalent. Recruitment, training, and promotion of child and 
adolescent mental health professionals remain leading priorities. Strains on available 
treatment resources are likely to grow as coverage is extended to large groups of currently 
uninsured American young people58 meeting their mental health care needs will pose critical 
challenges to health and mental health care professionals.
