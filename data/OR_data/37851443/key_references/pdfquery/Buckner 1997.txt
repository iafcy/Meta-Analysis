Mental Disorders and Service Utilization Among Youths 
From Homeless and Low-Income Housed Families 

















Children and adolescents represent a sizable percentage 
of our nation's poor. Approximately 20% of all children 
in this country live below the poverty line and, among 
the chronically poor, 48.1 % are under the age of 18 
(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1995a). Children of color 
are overrepresented in this group: 42% of black, 39% of 
Hispanic, and only 15% of white children are poor 
(Lewit, 1993). Risks associated with poverty among 
teen 
youths include factors such as school dropout,

pregnancy, poor health status, hunger, and delinquency 
(Dryfoos, 1990; Huston, 1991; Knitzer and Aber, 
1995). 
The U.S. Department of Education (1995) recently 
estimated that 744,000 school-age children and adoles 
cents are homeless in the course of a year. The expe 
rience of homelessness and residential instability, often 
coupled with stigmatization, typically stresses poor chil 
dren. Studies have noted elevated emotional symptoms 
and behavior problems among homeless youths com 
pared to normative data (Bassuk and Rosenberg, 1990; 
Masten et aI., 1993; Rescorla et aI., 1991; Zima et aI., 
1994). Yet to our knowledge, no prior study has assessed 
the mental health of children belonging to homeless 
families according to established diagnostic criteria. 
We report descriptive findings on the prevalence of 
emotional and behavioral disorders as well as mental 
health service utilization among a sample of 94 poor 
children aged 9 to 17 years; 44% were homeless at the 
time of assessment. Since this study is limited to a small 
sample of youths from one location, our findings should 
be viewed as preliminary. Nonetheless, they represent a 


starting point for better understanding the mental 
health needs and use of services among homeless and 
other youths belonging to poor families and highlight 
the importance of conducting more comprehensive 
studies in the future. 
These findings were made possible by methodological 
progress in the diagnostic assessment of childhood emo 
tional and behavioral disorders. At the forefront of these 
efforts is the collaborative work of investigators involved 
with the Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and 
Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA) Study sponsored 
by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) 
(Dulcan, 1996). The MECA study is the best descriptive 
epidemiological investigation to date on the prevalence 
of DSM-JII-R mental disorders among youths in the 
United States. Interviews were conducted with 1,285 
randomly selected families in New York, Connecticut, 
Georgia, and Puerto Rico. The MECA study has several 
key aims, including (1) testing the feasibility of survey 
ing parents and youths on mental health issues in antic 
ipation of a much larger-scale national study of child 
and adolescent mental disorders and service use and (2) 
examining the test-retest reliability and concurrent va 
lidity of the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule for 
Children (DISC) Version 2.3 (Lahey et aI., 1996; 
Schwab-Stone et aI., 1996; Shaffer et al., 1996). 
The DISC is a highly structured interview that can 
be administered by trained lay persons. It provides diag 
nostic information on mental disorders according to 
DSM-III-R criteria as well as limited information on 
service utilization. The DISC has two versions: one is 
administered directly to the youth and the other to a 
parent or other knowledgeable adult. Our use of the 
DISC-2.3 enables direct comparison with prevalence 
rates reported in the MECA study. 

This investigation was embedded within a case-control study of 
220 shelteted homeless families and a comparison group of 216 low 
income housed (never homeless) families and their 627 dependent 
children in Worcester, MA. Data were collected between 1992 and 
1995. The broader aims, sampling, and data collection procedutes 
for the overall study have been previously described (see Bassuk et 
aI., 1996b, 1997). In sum, we recruited currently homeless single 
mothers and their dependent children from all nine of Worcester's 
emergency shelters and transitional housing facilities. Low-income 
housed single mothers receiving Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children (AFDC) and their children were enrolled from the 
Department of Public Welfare Office to form a comparison group of 
poor but never homeless families. 

Mothers from both the homeless and housed groups participated 
in a structured interview conducted over three to four sessions cover 
ing themselves as well as each of their children. We obtained detailed 
information from the mother about demographic characteristics, 
factors in the mothers' childhood and adulthood that might 
influence the risk for and consequences of homelessness, and service 
needs. Information about children's developmental history, health, 
stressful life events, and service use patterns was also gathered. 

To ensure a sufficient sample of homeless school-age children, we 
selected up to two children aged 6 and older from both homeless 
and housed families. As described more extensively by Buckner et aI. 
(unpublished), a total of 80 homeless school-age children from 57 
separate families and 148 housed school-age children belonging to 
98 families were assessed on a broad range of psychosocial variables. 
Only youths aged 9 and older were eligible for diagnostic assess 
ment, in keeping with the age range standards for the DISC (Shaffer 
et aI., 1996). Thus, we assessed the mental health of94 youths (from 
74 separate families) with the parent version of the DISC and also 
obtained the youth's self-report for 86 of these individuals (91 %). 

Similar to the MECA collaborators, we used both the youth and 
parent forms of the DISC-2.3 to assess a range of disorders includ 
ing disruptive behavior disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity dis 
order, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder), affective 
disorders (majot depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, and 
mania/hypomania), anxiety disorders (simple phobia, social phobia, 
agoraphobia, panic disorder, separation anxiety disorder, avoidant 
disotdet, overanxious disotder, generalized anxiety disorder, and ob 
sessive-compulsive disorder), and alcohol and other substance use 
disordets. Because of time constraints and low expected prevalence 
rates, Module B of the DISC, which asks diagnostic questions con 
cerning eating, elimination, and tic disorders, was not administered. 
Unlike the MECA collaborators, who administered the DISC with 
the assistance of a computer, we followed a standard "paper-and 
pencil" interview format. Because of the sizable number of Hispanic 
families in our sample (primarily Puerto Rican), the Spanish trans 
lation of the DISC, which was specifically developed for use with 
Hispanics of Puerto Rican descent (Bravo et aI., 1993), was used for 
mothers and youths who did not speak English well. Our inter 
viewers, a team of highly educated (college and master's-level gradu 
ates) women, received specialized instruction on administering the 
DISC by a trainer from Columbia University (one of the four insti 
tutions involved in the MECA study) as well as one of the authors 
(J.CB.). 
Data from both the patent and youth versions of the DISC were 
scored via computer using diagnostic algorithms programmed from 
the Statistical Analysis for Software (SAS) language (Columbia 
University, 1993). 
Assessment of Associated Impairment and 
Level of Functioning 
The DISC-2.3 includes three to four questions within each diag 
nostic section regarding possible impairment associated with a par 
ticular disorder. Typically, these questions ask whether the symptoms 
of a disorder have caused problems with family members, with 
friends, or at school. A youth may meet criteria for a particular dis- 




order yer nor have any "diagnosric-specific impairmenr." If a yourh 
meers DSM-IIl-R crireria for a disorder and endorses one or more of 
rhe impairmenr quesrions, rhe yourh has mer "crireria wirh diagnos 
ric-specific (i.e., associared) impairmenr." 
Unlike rhe MECA invesrigarors, we did nor use rhe Children's 
Global Assessmenr Scale (CGAS) (Shaffer er aI., 1983) ro measure 
level of funcrioning. Insread, adaprive funcrioning was more com 
prehensively assessed using rhe Vineland Screener (Sparrow er aI., 
1995), a 60-irem shortened version of rhe Vineland Survey Form 
(Sparrow er aI., 1984). Scores on rhe Screener can be rransformed 
inro corresponding scores on rhe Survey version; normarive dara on 
a represenrarive narional sample of children and yourhs exisr for rhe 
laner. Borh versions of rhe Vineland are adminisrered in a semisrruc 
cured inrerview ro a person (in our scudy, rhe yourh's morher) who 
knows abour rhe child's comperencies and behavioral deficirs. For 
children 6 years and older, rhe Vineland assesses adaprive funcrion 
ing in rhree areas: communicarion, daily living skills, and social 
izarion. An Adaprive Behavior Composire (Vineland-ABC) score is 
compured by summing scores across rhese domains and represenrs a 
global measure of adaprive funcrioning. In srandard score formar, ir 
has a mean of 100 and a srandard deviarion equal ro 15. For each of 
rhe rhree domain scores and rhe composire score, rhe Vineland 
Screener has very good correspondence (r = .90 and higher) wirh 
rhe more in-deprh Vineland Survey Form (Spartow er aI., 1995). 

In rhe MECA scudy, rhe parenr version of rhe DISC was found ro 
have grearer crirerion-relared validiry for mosr disorders in compar 
ison wirh rhe yourh version (Schwab-Srone er aI., 1996); a clinician's 
rarings of rhe presence or absence of a disorder served as rhe crirerion 
or "gold srandard." There were cwo exceprions ro rhis general find 
ing: Wirh borh major depressive and dysrhymic disorders, rhe yourh 
version of rhe DISC evidenced grearer validiry as derermined by 
higher concordance wirh symprom rarings and diagnoses made by 
clinicians (Schwab-Srone er aI., 1996). In lighr of rhe MECA find 
ings, we presenr resulrs based predominanrly on rhe parenr version 
ofrhe DISC 
Our prevalence rares were also derermined using rhree disrincr def 
inirions for whar consricures a "case." Using rhe case definirion rermed 
"crireria only," we report rhe percenrage of yourhs who mer DSM-IlI 
R crireria for a particular disorder on rhe DISC The prevalence rare

rdlecrs rhe percenrage of yourhs who mer DSM-IIl-R crireria and who

Vineland <85") repons rhe percenrage of yourhs who mer diagnosric 
crireria and had ar leasr one impairmenr and scored lower rhan one 
srandard deviarion (less rhan 8S) on the Vineland-ABC (A score of 
less than 85 on rhe Vineland-ABC is indicarive of significanr global 
problems in adaprive behavior and funcrioning, placing a yourh no 
higher rhan rhe 16rh percenrile relarive ro orher children rhe same

definirion as "seriously emorionally disrurbed." The firsr cwo case def 
inirions are idenrical wirh rhose used in rhe MECA srudy (cf., Shaffer 
er al., 1996). The rhird is slightly differenr because of our use of rhe 
Vineland insread of the CGAS as a global measure of functioning. 

Wirh quesrions from rhe DISC-2.3, morhers were asked near rhe 
end of each diagnosric secrion wherher or nor rheir child had ever 
"seen a docror, psychianisr, psychologisr, social worker, guidance 
counselor or any orher professional like rhar because of [the signs or 
symproms of rhe disorder in quesrion]." Those answering affirma 
rively were rhen asked wherher rhe child had seen a professional in 
rhe preceding 6 monrhs. For children who had not seen a profes 
sional because of the disorder, rhe mother was asked wherher she 
had ever thoughr rhe child should be seen because of rhe signs or 
symproms of rhe menral healrh problem. 


Boys and girls were approximately equally rep 
resented among the 41 homeless and 53 housed youths, 
aged 9 and older for whom a parent version of the 
DISC had been administered. Overall, the average age 
was 11.8 years (11.4 years for homeless youths and 12.2 
years for housed youths). Homeless children were less 
likely to be white compared with their housed counter 
parts (26.8% versus 37.7%) and were more commonly 
Puerto Rican Hispanic (48.8% versus 34.0%). Black 
youths were about equally represented in both groups 
(17.1 % for homeless versus 18.9% for housed) as were 
youths of other race/ethnic backgrounds (7.3% for 
homeless and 9.4% for housed children). 
These youths had experienced many stressful life 
events in the prior year, with higher rates found among 
the homeless children. Mothers reported that 39% of 
homeless youths and 17% of housed youths had wit 
nessed some form of violence at home or in the com 
munity in the previous year. Residential instability was 
pronounced, especially for homeless youths, who had 
moved an average of 3.7 times in the preceding 12 
months compared with 0.7 times for housed youths. 
During the previous year, 70% of the homeless and 
32% of the housed children had changed schools. 
Mothers of homeless youths reported that 17% had 
been physically abused and 22% sexually abused at 
some point in the past. The corresponding rates were 
15% and 6% for housed children. Twenty-four percent 
of the homeless youths and 4% of the housed had been 
placed in foster care. 

Mothers of homeless children were 33.7 years old on 
average compared with 36.4 years for mothers of 
housed children. Reflecting their status as single par 
ents, about one third in each group had never married 
and close to 60% were either separated, divorced, or 


widowed. Forty percent of housed mothers and 53.9% 
of homeless mothers had graduated from high school, 
and the average annual income of families in both 
groups was about $12,000. All housed and most home 
less mothers (76%) were receiving AFDC. 

Table 1 provides three different prevalence rates re 
flecting our three separate "case definitions" for each 
disorder. In keeping with the MECA study's findings 
concerning the criterion validity of the DISC-2.3 (dis 
cussed in "Method" section), all disorders diagnosed 
with the parent version of the DISC are shown. In ad 
dition, for major depression and dysthymia, we also re 
port the prevalence rates generated by the youth version 
of the DISC. 
As shown in Table 1, 31.9% of the homeless and 
housed children in our study had one or more (i.e., 
"any") DISC disorders with associated impairment. 
About 12% of youths appeared seriously emotionally 
disturbed in that they met criteria for at least one dis 
order, had impairment associated with that condition, 
and had low scores on the Vineland-ABC. Looking 
across diagnostic groupings, disruptive behavior dis 
orders were the most prevalent for both homeless and 
housed youths; for oppositional defiant disorder, 14% 
of children met criteria and had associated impairment. 
Anxiety disorders were also prominent, as were affective 
disorders. When impairment was added as a qualifier, 
specific anxiety disorders had comparable prevalence 
rates in the combined sample. No youths met criteria 
for substance abuse or dependence (of alcohol, mari 
juana, or any other drug) with either version of the 
DISC. Also, no youths received a diagnosis of a manic 
or hypomanic condition. 
Table 2 shows the percentage of youths in each group 
and overall who received diagnoses for two or more co 
occurring disorders, three or more disorders, and four or 
more disorders according to the three separate def 
initions of caseness. Sixteen percent of the overall sam 
ple had two or more co-occurring disorders with 
associated impairment. Overall, 7.4% who met criteria 
for two or more disorders had impairment specific to 
each disorder and were globally impaired as evidenced 
by a score of less than 85 on the Vineland-ABC. 
Homeless youths had higher prevalence rates of co-oc 
curring disorders than housed youths, although these 
differences are modest. 



Table 3 presents "criteria + impairment" prevalence 
rates for boys and girls separately. Because substantial 
differences were noted between the two genders accord 
ing to housing status, these figures are broken down fur 
ther, between homeless and housed boys and homeless 
and housed girls. Overall, boys and girls had equivalent 
rates for any DISC disorder, although boys tended to 
have more disruptive behavior disorders and girls more 
anxiety disorders. Homeless boys had about double the 
rate of housed boys (and homeless girls) within each di 
agnostic category and for any DISC disorder. The re 
verse was the case for girls: housed girls had 
approximately twice the rate of disorder within each di 
agnostic category compared with homeless girls (and 
housed boys). The small sample size makes race/ethnic 
comparisons difficult. In general, prevalence rates for 
various disorders across the four groupings (whites, 
blacks, Puerto Rican Hispanics, other minority) were 
quite similar. These rates were also comparable when 
broken down further by housing status. 

Table 4 presents the number of youths falling within 
a particular DISC diagnostic category and the percent 
age of children who had been seen by a "doctor, psychi 
atrist, psychologist, social worker, guidance counselor 
or any other professional like that because of [the signs 
or symptoms of a particular disorder]." For example, of 
the 16 children in the combined sample who met the 
"criteria only" case definition for at least one of the dis 
ruptive behavior disorders, 5 (31.3%) had received 
some form of mental health "treatment" in the preced 
ing 6 months; service use was roughly equivalent for 
homeless and housed youths. Only one additional 
mother reported that her child had ever been treated 
(total of 37.5%). Seven children met criteria for a dis 
ruptive behavior disorder and were globally impaired as 
well. Just one (14.3%) of these seven seriously emo 
tionally disturbed children had received mental health 
treatment in the preceding 6 months (or ever). 
Looking across the disruptive behavior, anxiety, and 
depressive disorders for all youths who met criteria with 
associated impairment, the percentages of those who 
had seen someone in the preceding 6 months were 
roughly comparable, ranging from 20% to 35%.

five (71 %) of the seven mothers perceived a need for 
their child to receive menral health rreatmenr. 

Past research has implicated poverty as a risk factor 
for menral health problems in children and adolescenrs 
(Institute of Medicine, 1994; Knitzer and Aber, 1995; 
McLoyd and Wilson, 1991; Tuma, 1989). Similar to ex 
tremely poor youths in other studies, the children in 
our study had experienced various severe life srressors, 
such as abuse, witness to domestic and/or community 
violence, and foster care placement. In addition to los 
ing one's home, srressors such as residential instability 
and changing schools were the norm for homeless 
youths. 
Shaffer et al. (1996) contend that "caseness" is best 
defined by the presence of signs and symptoms of a dis 
order as well as associated impairment rather than by 
meeting diagnostic criteria alone. Because this approach 
is a clear indicator of the need for rreatment, we empha 
size our second and third case definitions in reporting 
and discussing prevalence rates. Youths meeting our sec 
ond case definition (criteria + impairment) are not nec 
essarily impaired in their overall level of functioning, 
but they may need services. Many youths meeting the 
third case definition (criteria + impairment + poor 
global functioning) are likely to be "seriously emo 
tionally disturbed" and are in definite need of mental 
health treatment. 
While sweeping conclusions cannot be made from 
this investigation given the small sample size and single 
locale, our findings support other studies that have doc 
umented an adverse relationship between poverty and 
menral health. In our sample, we found that 31.9% of 
youths met criteria for at least one (i.e., "any") DISC 
disorder with associated impairmenr (Table 1). This 
prevalence rate is 66% higher than the comparable 
prevalence figure of 19.2% for "any disorder (with im 
pairmenr)" diagnosed by MECA study investigators in a 
sample of youths more representative of the general 
population (see Shaffer et aI., 1996). For any DISC dis 
order with impairment (excluding simple phobia), we 
found a prevalence rate that is 77% higher than was di 
agnosed in the MECA study (28.7% versus 16.2%). 
This contrast highlights the added mental health bur 
den that youths and families living in poverty may be 
experiencing. At the same time, it is also possible that 
significant mental health problems experienced by a 
child can exacerbate the economic condition of a single

parent and may also partially account for the high prev 
alence rate we found in this sample of impoverished 
single-parent families. 
When comparing parent-generated prevalence rates 
using the same case definition (criteria + impairment) 
between our study and the MECA study (see Shaffer et 
aI., 1996, for MECA findings), similar rates were 
found for attention deficit disorder and any substance 
abuse/dependence (we found 0%; the MECA study 
found less than 1%). For all other disorders, our rates 
were substantially higher, especially for oppositional 
defiant disorder (14.1 % versus 4.4%), simple phobia 
(7.7% versus 1.3%), and major depression (9.8% 
versus 3.0%). 
The use of different measures for level of functioning 
precludes a precise comparison of the number of youths 
who were found to have a disorder with associated im 
pairment and poor global functioning. In our sample, 
11.7% of youths (n = 11) met this description and con- 
stitute a group of seriously emotionally disturbed chil 
dren. Of these, six had three or more disorders. Because 
findings on co-occurring conditions in the MECA 
study have not been published, there is no basis for 
companson. 
We did not find noteworthy differences in rates of 
mental disorders between boys and girls or among the 
four race/ethnic groups. However, homeless boys had 
double the rate of disorder compared with housed boys, 
while housed girls had double the rate compared with 
homeless girls. One possible explanation is that boys are 
more adversely affected than girls when living in a 
shelter setting. Residing in close quarters with their 
mother and siblings and lacking a same-sex parent, boys 
may have more internalizing and externalizing problems 
than they would experience in a housed setting. Girls, 
on the other hand, may be more protected from exter 
nal influences in a shelter. They may be more able than 
boys to control their behavior and may be supportive to 



their mothers during crisis compared with when they 
are living in permanent housing. Further research is 
needed to confirm and clarify the apparent interaction 
between gender and housing status. 
Even when defining mental health treatment broadly 
(being seen by a professional could have involved an 
assessment or treatment on just one occasion), the 
combined sample reported only modest rates of mental 
health-related service use. Of special concern is that the 
seriously emotionally disturbed youths appeared less 
likely to have been seen in the preceding 6 months than 
were higher-functioning youths with a current disorder; 
yet most of the mothers of the seriously disturbed youths 
who had never received treatment did perceive their 
child's need for help. The MECA study used a I-year 
time frame for reporting mental health-related service 
use, rendering a comparison to our data problematic. 

As we have discussed, our findings on the prevalence 
of mental disorders among homeless and housed youths 
must be looked at as tentative estimates, given the small 
sample size from one location. The sample size also 
limits our statistical power for detecting real differences 
among subgroups. Thus, we have chosen not to report 
tests of statistical significance as these results could po 
tentially be misleading. A strength of this investigation 
is the close comparability of findings with that of the 
MECA study. Still, there are slight discrepancies in 
methodology that we have noted which make various 
comparisons difficult. In addition, the MECA study is 
not entirely representative of youths in the United 
States since its sample was drawn from only three east 
ern states and Puerto Rico. 
In terms of generalizing to other poor and/or home 
less youths, our overall sample of 220 homeless families 
is comparable with sheltered homeless families in nine 
large American cities with respect to the mother's age 
and average number of children (Rog et aI., 1995). 
However, our sample has fewer blacks and a greater per 
centage of Hispanics. Comparison group mothers are 
similar to Worcester's broader AFDC population in 
terms of age and race/ethnicity. Compared with women 
receiving AFDC nationwide, the housed mothers are 
more likely to be Hispanic (42% versus 18%) and less 
likely to be black (10% versus 45%) but are similar in 
mean age, education, and number of children (U.S. 
Bureau of the Census, 1990, 1995b). 

This study is the first of its kind to document mental 
health problems in youths belonging to homeless and 
extremely poor housed families according to established 
diagnostic criteria. Our findings (and their limitations) 
highlight the need for more comprehensive investiga 
tions of the mental health needs and service use of poor 
youths in this country. It is important that youths who 
are homeless and with their families (e.g., children in 
this study) as well as unaccompanied adolescents (i.e., 
those who have left home or foster care situations and 
are living on the streets or in shelters for homeless and 
runaway teenagers) be included in future epidemiologi 
cal investigations of child and adolescent mental health. 
Findings from surveys based solely on household-based 
sampling frames are not representative of all youths in 
this country because they exclude homeless children 
and adolescents and, therefore, likely underestimate the 
actual rate o~ mental health problems. 
Historically, th~ mental health care system in the 
United States has failed to meet the needs of children 
and adolescents (Institute of Medicine, 1989; Knitzer, 
1982; Leaf et al., 1996; National Mental Health 
Advisory Council, 1990; Tuma, 1989). Comprehensive, 
coordinated systems of mental health care are lacking in 
many communities because of shortages in community 
based services, especially case management, and inade 
quate linkages among agencies (Knitzer, 1982; Tuma, 
1989). When treatment is available to children with di 
agnosable conditions, it is usually beneficial, although 
research is needed to determine what types of treatment 
modalities (e.g., individual therapy, family therapy, 
pharmacological intervention) work for whom and in 
which settings (Tuma, 1989). 
Our data suggest that the mental health needs of 
some children are not being attended to, either because 
of the lack of availability of services, barriers to treat 
ment, or failure to recognize need. To understand better 
why some poor children lack critical services even when 
treatment is available, the realities of poor families' lives 
and the barriers to service use must be considered. The 
family composition of youths in our study (single 
parent, female-headed families) is becoming the norm 
among poor families. Single mothers, faced with the task 
of.supporting and raising children with few social sup 
ports and diminishing economic aid, have many press 
ing and competing demands. For some families, a child's 


need for mental health treatment may be a low priority 
compared with the need for shelter, food, and clothing. 
When services are available and judged to be effective, 
lack of transportation and child care for siblings can 
become insurmountable barriers to care. Especially for 
poor youths belonging to single-parent, female-headed 
families, it is important that the mother's stressors, 
including domestic violence and her current mental 
health status, be considered when devising a treatment 
plan. Family-based interventions are likely to be more 
effective in helping youths with mental health problems 
than are treatment plans that do not consider issues 
pertaining to the mother, siblings, and extended family. 
Our findings, as well as anecdotal reports from the 
interviewers, suggest that some youths living in poverty 
may have unrecognized but significant untreated mental 
health needs. For example, a mother may be experienc 
ing her own mental health or substance abuse problems, 
making it more difficult for her to attend to similar 
problems in her children. Schools have an important 
role to play in identifYing children with emotional and 
behavioral problems and ensuring that they find treat 
ment, especially when parents are unable to help their 
child. Better linkages among schools, shelters, and tradi 
tional mental health workers would help to identifY 
children's emotional needs earlier and facilitate the es 
tablishment of appropriate treatment. Primary health 
care physicians can also playa critical role in detecting 
the signs and symptoms of a mental disorder and refer 
ring the child for treatment. In concert with case man 
agers, they can work together to develop and implement 
comprehensive treatment. 
Community outreach to poor families that provides 
education about children's mental health problems and 
information concerning treatment efficacy is needed to 
promote service utilization. Providers' awareness of is 
sues that a poor, single parent faces is vital in obtaining 
her involvement and cooperation in her child's treat 
ment. Finally, mental health treatment needs to be af 
fordable to poor families. 
In conclusion, given the high levels of stress and 
other adverse correlates of poverty experienced by the 
youths in our study, it is not surprising that we found 
higher rates of current emotional and behavioral dis 
orders compared with the MECA study, especially since 
the latter is a sample of youths more representative of 
the general population. Recent welfare reform raises the 
specter of growing hardships and increased risk for 

homelessness among poor families as term limits on 
cash assistance and cutbacks in antipoverty programs go 
into effect (Bassuk et aI., 1996a, 1997). Children living 
in poverty, many in single-parent, female-headed house 
holds. will likely experience this stress both directly and 
as a result of their mother's distress. As welfare and other 
antipoverty programs undergo change at the state level, 
care must be taken to not compound the difficulties 
faced by poor families. Youths in general, and especially 
those who are impoverished, should have access to men 
tal health treatment as well as opportunities and assis 
tance in achieving their full potential.
