Background: In Latin America, there is limited research on the prevalence of mental disorders in 
children and adolescents. This Chilean survey is the ﬁrst national representative survey in the Latin 
American region to examine the prevalence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) psychi- 
atric disorders in the region in children and adolescents. Methods: Subjects aged 4–18 were selected 
using a stratiﬁed multistage design. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children version IV (DISC-IV) 
was used to obtain 12-month DSM-IV diagnoses of affective, anxiety, conduct and substance use dis- 
orders, and supplemented with questionnaires examining family risk factors, family income, and service 
utilization. The parent or the primary caretaker was interviewed for children, aged 4–11, using the 
DISC-IV; however, adolescents, aged 12–18, were directly interviewed. Results: A sample of 1558 
children and adolescents was evaluated. Using the most stringent DISC-IV impairment algorithm, the 
prevalence rate for any psychiatric disorders was 22.5% (19.3% for boys and 25.8% for girls). The 
prevalence rate was higher among the children, aged 4–11, in comparison with adolescents, aged 12–18 
(27.8% and 16.5%, respectively). Less than half of the subjects in need of services sought some form of 
assistance. Nearly a quarter of those using services did not present with a psychiatric diagnosis in the 
past year. Comorbidity was found in 24.8% of those with a disorder, but only 6.3% had three or more 
diagnoses. Conclusions: The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in Chile is high among children and 
adolescents. This study highlights the increasing need to reevaluate mental health services provided to 
children and adolescents in Latin America. Keywords: Children, adolescent, epidemiology, mental

Introduction 
There has been a growing need to better understand 
the prevalence and associated factors for mental 
health problems in children and adolescents in Latin 
America. In 2005, a sizable proportion of the popu- 
lation was less than 15 years old, ranging from 35.7% 
in Central America to 27.2% in the Southern Cone, 
which includes Chile, in contrast to 18.8% for North 
America (Pan American Health Organization, 2010). 
The growing pandemic of violence and substance use 
has made more pressing an understanding of the 
mental health needs of children and adolescents in 
the region. The World Health Organization, (2005) 
(WHO) has emphasized that psychiatric disorders 
with onset in childhood and adolescence should be a 
matter of public health concern, as highlighted by the 
publication of the Atlas devoted to child and adoles- 
cent mental health resources. 
Conﬂict of interest statement: The authors report no biomedi- 
cal ﬁnancial interests or potential conﬂicts of interest. 
Despite the need for information on the mental 
health of children and adolescents in the region, 
research in most countries is scarce. Studies exam- 
ining the prevalence of disorders in children using 
diagnostic instruments have been limited to Brazil 
(Anselmi, Fleitlich-Bilyk, Menezes, Arau´ jo, & Rohde, 
2010; Fleitlich-Bilyk & Goodman, 2004; Goodman 
et al., 2005) Puerto Rico (Bird et al., 1988; Shaffer 
et al., 1996; Canino et al., 2004), and Mexico (Benjet, 
Borges, Medina-Mora, Zambrano, & Aguilar-Gaxiola, 
2009). In Venezuela (Montiel-Nava et al., 2002) and 
Colombia, (Cornejo et al., 2005; Pineda et al., 1999) 
studies were also conducted, but limited to atten- 
(ADHD). The 
tion-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder 
prevalence surveys conducted in Brazil were limited 
to children, and the Mexican survey was limited to 
adolescents. In Chile, there was an earlier report on 
1st and 6th grade schoolchildren; however, it em- 
ployed a nonstandardized semistructured clinical 
interview conducted by child psychiatry fellows (de la 
Barra, Toledo, & Rodrı´guez, 2004). Earlier studies in 
Latin America (Duarte et al., 2003) and in Chile

(Bralio, Ximena, & Hernan, 1987) were based on 
screening instruments. Other than the studies con- 
ducted in Puerto Rico, which were island-wide, no 
prior studies have been conducted on a national 
representative sample in the region. In their review of 
(2008) 
ADHD in Latin America, Polanczyk et al. 
highlighted that there was a complete absence of 
national 
concerning children’s mental 
health in the region, and studies that generated 
evidence pertaining to speciﬁc populations could 
only be found in three of 46 countries. Merikangas, 
Nakamura, and Kessler (2009), in arguing that the 
United States was in need of a national mental 
health survey, stated ‘The absence of empirical data 
on the magnitude, course, and treatment patterns of 
mental disorder in a nationally representative sam- 
ple of US youth has impeded efforts essential for 
establishing mental health policy’. Only recently has 
the US conducted studies on child and adolescent 
mental health at a national level (Merikangas, He, 
Brody, et al., 2010; Merikangas, He, Burstein, et al., 
2010). Clearly, the argument is even stronger for 
Latin America where limited resources in child and 
adolescent mental health exist, as their mental 
health needs have not been fully met even in devel- 
oped countries (WHO, 2005). 
The purpose of the present study was to obtain 
prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders in a repre- 
sentative national sample of Chilean child and ado- 
lescents. This report focuses on the DSM-IV 12- 
month prevalence rates of disorders and the associ- 
ated sociodemographic correlates, comorbidity, and 
service utilization. 
Method 
Sample selection 
A stratiﬁed household sample representative of the 
country’s child, aged 4–11, and adolescent, aged 12–18, 
populations were obtained. Chile consists of 51 prov- 
inces, grouped into 15 regions, with a population of 
approximately 17 million, of which 5.3 million are less 
than 19 years old. 
The sample of children and adolescents was selected 
from four geographically distinct provinces, chosen as 
due to being representative of the distribution of the 
national population: Santiago, Concepcion, Iquique, 
and Cautin. One third of the nation’s population resides 
in the capital city, Santiago. Concepcion is located in 
the central region of Chile and is the second largest city. 
Iquique is in the north of the country and is a desert 
region, with many isolated towns. The province of 
Cautin, in the south, is a sparsely populated rural area. 
Most of Chile’s population, 89%, is comprised of urban 
dwellers. 
In Chile, provinces are subdivided into municipali- 
ties, comunas, then districts, and ﬁnally into blocks, 
each of which was selected randomly. The number of 
households available on each block was counted. Using 
the 2002 national census, the number of households 
required on each block was determined. The house- 
holds were chosen clockwise, starting with the ﬁrst one 
on the northeast corner using a computer algorithm 
specially designed for this purpose. Twelve homes per 
block were identiﬁed and 5 were surveyed. Selection of 
the child or adolescent to be interviewed was based on 
their birth date being the closet to the interview date. If 
more than one child had the same birth date, ties were 
resolved by a coin toss or the use a Kish table in the 
event of more than one tie. The targeted sample size was 
determined based on obtaining a probability sample 
that had a prevalence of psychiatric disorders of 18%, 
according to the DISC-IV study from Puerto Rico, with a 
95% conﬁdence interval and maximum standard error 
of 1.75 (Canino et al., 2004). 
The survey was conducted by the University of Con- 
cepcion’s Department of Psychiatry and University of 
Chile¢s East Mental Health Department between April 
2007 and December 2009. The sites were completed in 
the following order: Cautı´n, Santiago, Iquique, and 
Concepcion. 

The presence of a psychiatric disorder was accessed 
using the DISC-IV, Spanish computer version (Bravo 
et al., 2001; Shaffer, Fischer, Lucas, Dulcan, & 
Schwab-Stone, 2000), previously adapted and validated 
for Chile (Saldivia et al., 2008). Interviews took place 
in a private space without others 
in the home, 
present directly with the adolescent or the parent or 
primary caretaker of children (74.8% mother, 9.3% fa- 
ther, 7.8% grandparent, 5.1% sibling, 3.0% other), aged 
4–11 years, by psychology graduate students trained in 
the instrument’s use. Mental disorders selected for 
evaluation were social phobia, separation anxiety dis- 
order, generalized anxiety disorder 
(GAD), eating 
disorder, major depressive disorder, dysthymia, 
(ODD), 
schizophrenia, ADHD, oppositional-deﬁant 
conduct disorder, alcohol use disorders, cannabis use 
disorders, nicotine dependence, and other substance 
use disorders. 

The four impairment algorithms contained in the 
DISC-IV interview were ascertained according to the 
extent in which symptoms in six domains had stressed 
the child or affected his or her school achievement, or 
relationships with caretakers, 
friends, or 
teachers. Impairment criteria A required that at least 
one of the impairments is given an intermediate or 
severe rating (sometimes or many times; bad or very 
bad); criteria B required at least two intermediate or 
severe impairments; criteria C, at least one impairment 
in the severe category; and criteria D required that cri- 
terion B or C is present, i.e., at least two intermediate or 
one severe criteria. Criteria D were used in this analysis 
as the measure of impairment. 
for 
Service utilization, private and public sector, 
emotional, behavioral, psychiatric, and substance use 
problems in the past 12 months was investigated. 
School-based services included counseling, special 
educations, or other interventions for behavioral issues. 
Formal mental health services included both inpatient 
psychiatric treatment and outpatient treatment by a 
mental healthcare professional. Other medical services 
were deﬁned as care delivered by the formal healthcare 
system that was not provided by a mental healthcare 





professional. Social services included institutions that 
may provide assistance for behavioral or emotional 
problems outside the healthcare system or school, such 
as a juvenile program, prison, or family programs. 
Other services include counseling from religious lead- 
ers, curanderos, other healers, as well as social groups. 
Information about use of mental health services was 
based on the Service Assessment for Children and 
Adolescents (SACA) (Canino et al., 2002). The SACA has 
been shown to be valid when administered only to the 
(Stiffman et al., 
adolescent without parental 
2000). In addition, family functioning was examined 
using the 12-item global functioning scale of the Family 
Assessment Device (FAD) (Epstein, Baldwin, & Bishop, 
1983; Ridenour, Daley, & Reich, 1999), which is a 
subscale of the FAD, which measures overall health or 
pathology in the family and its psychometric properties 
previously evaluated in Chile (Barroihet, Cano-Prous, 
Cervera-Enguix, Forjaz, & Gulle´n-Grima, 2009). Family 
psychiatric history was obtained using the Family His- 
tory Screen (Weissman et al., 2000). Family income was 
measured based on the amount that family income was 
above the poverty line as deﬁned in Chile as of 
November 2009, 
rural areas, 
$4,249.46, and urban areas, $6,334,32, and analyzed 
as a categorical variable (poverty £ 2; poverty £ 5 but 
> 2; poverty £ 8 and > 5; poverty > 8). 

Upon completion, the research team reviewed each 
interview independently, and discrepancies were 
addressed with interviewers to obtain clariﬁcation or 
corrections. Homes where participation was refused 
were not replaced; replacement was performed only for 
those homes where no child or adolescent resided. 

The additional data collected that were not part of the 
DISC-IV was entered into an STATA 11.0 database 
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX), using double digi- 
tations for quality control. DISC-IV yields 12 months 
DSM-IV diagnoses. Prevalence rate estimates and the 
corresponding standard errors were obtained using 
STATA to take into account the complex sample design. 
Logistic regression was used to examine association of 
mental disorders with sociodemographic variables and 
other potential risk factors. First-order Taylor series 
linearization was used to calculate odds ratios, 95% 
conﬁdence intervals, and p values. 
Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine 
which risk factors were the best predictors for mental 
disorders. Variables entered into multivariate logistic 
regression model were selected based on a Rao Scott F 
statistic p < .25. 
Samples were weighted for selection probabilities in 
each stage: municipality, district, block, home, and 
child. In addition, a post-stratiﬁcation adjustment for 
gender and age was performed to ensure that the data 
analysis was based on the population from the 2002 
census. 
Written informed consent was obtained from the 
adult responsible for each child. To assure conﬁdenti- 
ality, the data analysis team did not have access to any 
identifying information. The adult responsible for each 
child or the adolescent was offered the opportunity to 
receive the diagnostic results by certiﬁed letter based on 
the DISC-IV upon request. Identiﬁed cases were rec- 
ommended to seek treatment in the local mental health 
network. Unfortunately, this did not guarantee that 
treatment would effectively take place as it depended on 
the caretaker’s or the adolescent’s following through 
with recommendations and availability of mental health 
resources. The ethical research committees of the Uni- 
versity of Concepcion and that of the funding institution 
approved the study. 
Results 
A total of 1558 individuals were interviewed, 50.9% 
boys and 49.1% girls. More than half of the sample, 
52.9%, consisted of children, 4–11 years of age, and 
47.1% were adolescents, aged 12–18. The refusal 
rate was acceptable with a response rate of 82.4%. 

Table 1 shows the 1-year prevalence of speciﬁc 
diagnoses. The prevalence rate for all disorders was 
impairment and 22.5% when 
38.3% without 
impairment was taken into account. The most pre- 
valent diagnostic group were disruptive disorders, 
14.6%, followed by anxiety disorders, 8.3%, and 
including impairment. 
affective disorders, 5.1%, 
Substance use disorders in children and adolescents 
had a prevalence of 1.2%. Eating disorders and 
schizophrenia were relatively rare. 

Table 2 shows the relationship between diagnostic 
groups and sociodemographic risk factors. In com- 
parison with boys, girls had a higher risk for devel- 
oping anxiety disorders. More speciﬁcally, girls were 
at a higher risk than boys for social phobia 
[OR = 3.4, 95% CI (1.3–8.6)] and for GAD [OR = 4.5, 
95% CI (1.8, 11.5)]. A gender difference in the prev- 
alence rate for affective disorders was not seen when 
impairment was taken into account. Interestingly, 
no gender differences were noted for disruptive or 
substance use disorders. When children and ado- 
lescents were analyzed independently; no gender 
differences were found for children. However, for 
anxiety disorders [OR = 5.5, 95% CI (2.0–15.3)] and 
for mood disorders [OR = 4.1, 95% CI (1.2–13.7)], 
girls had signiﬁcantly higher rates than boys, but 
not for substance use disorders or disruptive disor- 
ders. 
Few statistically signiﬁcant differences in preva- 
lence rates were noted between children and ado- 
lescents. When impairment was included, 
the 
signiﬁcant differences between age groups and 
affective disorders was no longer noted. Although 
overall children had higher rates of disruptive dis- 
orders, this was not the case for each of the speciﬁc 
disorders. For ADHD [OR = 0.3, 95% CI (0.1, 0.5)] 
and ODD [OR = 0.3, 95% CI (0.1, 0.6)] adolescents

had lower prevalence rates than children. However, 
for conduct disorder, adolescents had higher 
rates than children [OR = 3.2, 95% CI (1.2, 8.4)]. 
Statistically signiﬁcant differences were not found 
between the two age groups for anxiety disorders. 
None of the children, but only adolescents, in this 




study were diagnosed with a substance use disor- 
ders. 
Perception of poorer family function was signiﬁ- 
cantly associated with each of the categories of 
mental disorders. The family structure was related to 
child and adolescent mental health. With the 
exception of substance use disorders, children living 
with only one parent had signiﬁcantly higher rates of 
mental disorders. Parental psychopathology was a 
risk factor for affective and disruptive disorders, but 
not anxiety disorders or substance use disorders. 
Family income was inversely related to anxiety dis- 
orders. 

The results of the multiple logistic regression models 
are presented taking into account impairment in 
Tables 3. For anxiety disorders, 
female gender, 
family income, history of psychopathology, and liv- 
ing with only one parent remained statistically sig- 
niﬁcant. A positive family history and not living with 
both parents were signiﬁcant in the multiple logistic 
regression model for affective disorders; gender was 
not signiﬁcant. The signiﬁcant risk factors for con- 
duct disorders were being an adolescent, a positive 
family psychiatric history, living with only one par- 
ent, and poor family functioning. There were few 
signiﬁcant correlates in the model for substance use 
disorders. For substance, poor family functioning 
and being in the highest income group were signiﬁ- 
cant. When any disorder was examined in the 
regression model, being an adolescent, family psy- 
chopathology, living with only one parent, and poor 
family functioning were statistically signiﬁcant, but 
not gender. 

Comorbidity when impairment was 
included 
(n = 329) was seen in nearly a quarter of those with a 
disorder, 24.8%, with 6.3% having three or more 
disorders. Gender differences, girls having higher 
rates of mental disorders than boys, were appreci- 
ated only in those with comorbidity (Table 4). Poor 
family functioning, having parental psychopathol- 
ogy, and not living with both parents, had an in- 
creased risk for mental disorders whether or not 
comorbidity was present. However, an inverse rela- 
tionship with family income and mental disorders 
was only seen in those with three or more comorbid 
disorders. 

In all, 41.6% of the interviewed subjects having a 
disorder including impairment had sought assis- 
tance either formally or informally due to a behav- 
ioral, emotional, psychiatric, or substance use- 
related problem. The most frequent source for help- 
seeking were school-based services, 21.9%, followed 
by the formal mental health services, 19.1%. Only 
5.3% of the subjects contacted traditional healers, 
alternative medicine or self-aid groups (Table 5). A

majority, 58.4% of children and adolescents who had 
a mental disorder including impairment, did not re- 
ceive assistance of any form. 
Discussion 
This is the ﬁrst nationally representative child and 
adolescent survey of mental disorders conducted in 
Latin America. The results found that nearly a 
quarter of the children and adolescent in Chile have 
disorders that include impairment. Overall, disor- 
ders were associated with poorer family functioning, 
family psychopathology, and not living with both 
parents in both bivariate and multivariate models. 
Comorbidity was found in over a third of those with a 
disorder. Most children in need of mental health 
services did not receive assistance. There was a 
treatment gap of 58.4% among those with impair- 
ment for any type of treatment and treatment gap of 
80.9% with the formal mental health system. 
Interestingly, nearly 18% of those without a diag- 
nosis used mental health services. If one takes into 
account disorders without impairment and sub- 
threshold cases, the rate is decreased to 8.1%. As 
lifetime prevalence was not measured, those who 
may no longer be symptomatic but are in treatment 
and in remission could account for a sizeable pro- 
portion of the those seeking help, as well as persons 
with disorder that were not included in the survey 
(manic episodes, speciﬁc phobia, posttraumatic 
stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and 
panic disorder). 




This study had a number of strengths. Unlike most 
child and mental health studies in the region, an 
internationally validated diagnostic interview sche- 
dule was used rather than screening instruments. 
Previous validation in a local sample made it possi- 
ble to use the DISC-IV interview in Chile. The re- 
sponse rate was satisfactory in comparisons with 
studies that report it, higher than several 
(Ford, 
Goodman, and Meltzer, 2003; Heiervang et al., 
2007), comparable to others (Merikangas, He, Bur- 
stein, et al., 2010), and lower than some (Fleitlich- 
Bilyk & Goodman, 2004). Unlike many of the studies 
conducted in Latin America region, we used a broad 
age rather than a narrow age range. In addition, we 
collected risk factor data rarely obtained in child 
psychiatric epidemiological studies in Latin America 
including parental psychopathology, 
family func- 
tioning, and family income, and most importantly, 
service utilization. 

limitations. Most 
researchers have tried to combine information from 
multiple informants, such as obtaining additional 
information from teachers for children and from 
parents for adolescents. In a British study, infor- 
mation from teachers persuaded the clinician to 
make more diagnoses of disruptive disorders than 
they would have made based on the parent’s infor- 
mation alone (Ford, Goodman, & Meltzer, 2003). In 
Latin America, community-based methods rather 
than school-based studies are needed. Relying on 
schools rather than household sampling in the 
region may miss potentially vulnerable children, as 
they may not attend school even though compulsory. 
This approach captured nearly all the vulnerable 
child and adolescent population, as only 0.28% of all 
children in Chile reside in institutions, and of the 
homeless population. 9.3% is less than age 18 or 
about 675 persons based on a 2005 national survey 
of the homeless (Minoletti, 2010). Although it may 
have been ideal to interview the parent, as well the 
adolescent, this was not done in this study. It has 
been recommended that for adolescents, the parent 
and adolescent version of the DISC be administered 
and a positive response in either be considered (Bird, 
Gould, & Staghezza, 1992; Lahey et al., 1996; Pia- 
centini, Cohen, & Cohen, 1992). Investigators have 
also suggested parents under-report compared with 
their children (Weissman et al., 1987). In the current 
study, adolescents had a prevalence rate for all dis- 
orders of 33.2% excluding impairment; it is not clear 
how much more a parent would therefore contribute. 
In addition, an issue that merits investigation is if 
adolescent may be less likely to acknowledge symp- 
toms if they were aware that the parent was also 
interviewed. 
Another possible weakness of this study is that we 
did not add a global impairment measure indepen- 
dent of the impairment criteria already incorporated 
in the DISC-IV. Canino et al. 
(2004) has dis- 
cussed the need not to rely exclusively on the DISC 
impairment measures, which are speciﬁc for each 
diagnosis, as the DISC evaluates only a selected 
group of DSM-IV diagnoses. An external measure of 
impairment permits identiﬁcation of children who 
may be impaired, but do not have a diagnosis. 
Recently, the sociocultural applicability of the 
DISC-IV has been raised in a study in South Africa 
(Sharp, Skinner, Serekoane, & Ross, 2011). 
Although this is an important issue, the DISC-IV has 
been used in Spanish-speaking populations previ- 
ously (Bird et al., 1988; Canino et al., 2004; Shaffer 
et al., 1996) and has undergone clinical validation in 
Chile (Saldivia et al., 2008). 
In comparison with other Latin American studies, 
the rates we obtained may be considered high, but in 
line with more recent studies. The three studies 
conducted in Brazil all used the Developmental and 
Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) (Goodman, Ford, 
Richards, Meltzer, & Gatward, 2000). The study 
conducted in Taubate had a prevalence rate for all 
disorders of 12.7% (Fleitlich-Bilyk & Goodman, 
2004), the one in Ilha de Mare, 7.0% (Goodman et al., 
2005) and Pelotas, 10.8%. (Anselmi et al., 2010). 
This is in contrast to the rate of 22.5% including 
impairment that we obtained. Two of the DAWBA 
studies used a two-stage procedure that may have 
been overly selective (Anselmi et al., 2010; Goodman 
et al., 2005); these studies incorporated a clinician 
appraisal that may also have resulted in lower rates. 
These studies were also limited to children aged 7–14 
(Fleitlich-Bilyk & Goodman, 2004; Goodman et al., 
2005) and 11–12 (Anselmi et al., 2010). In our study, 
children had a signiﬁcantly higher prevalence rate 
for all mental disorders than did adolescents, further 
highlighting the contrast between our ﬁndings and 
those in Brazil and raising issues of methodological 
differences. In comparison with the study conducted 
in Puerto Rico using the DISC-IV, reporting 19.8% 
excluding impairment among 4–17 year olds (Canino 
et al., 2004), our results seem to be markedly ele- 
vated, 38.3% excluding impairment. More recently, a 
survey of adolescents, aged 12–17, in Mexico City 
(Benjet, Borges, Medina-Mora, Zambrano, et al., 
2009) using the Composite Diagnostic Interview 
(CIDI-A) (Merikangas, Avenevoli, Costello, Koretz, & 
Kessler, 2009), obtained a prevalence rate of 39.4% 
excluding impairment, which is even higher than the 
33.2% we obtained in Chile; however, the inclusion of 
speciﬁc phobia with a prevalence of 20.9% may ac- 
count for this difference. Otherwise, our prevalence 
including impairment is remarkably similar to that 
obtained by Merikangas et al. (2010b) among US 
adolescents, 22.0%. 
It is surprising that statistical signiﬁcance with 
family income was obtained only for anxiety disor- 
ders, as other studies have found stronger associa- 
tions for externalizing rather than internalizing 
disorders (Lipman, Offord, & Boyle, 1996; McLoyd, 
1998). Several studies since 2000 have noted a 
relationship only with internalizing disorders or 




anxiety disorders as noted in Chile (Carter et al., 
2010; Farbstein et al., 2010; Roberts, Roberts, & 
Xing, 2007). Environment-related stressors have 
been found to partially mediate the association 
between mental health problems and socioeconomic 
position (Amone-P’Olak et al., 2009). 
When children and adolescents were examined 
separately, girls had markedly higher rates of mood 
and anxiety disorders than boys, for adolescents but 
not for children. This is consistent with the literature 
that suggests that with the onset of menarche, the 
burden of illness for depression shifts toward a 2:1 
ratio for girls compared to boys (Born, Shea, & 
Steiner, 2000). In Chile, among adolescents, girls 
had a prevalence of 11.1% compared to boys 3.0%, 
while among children, the rates were 3.6% and 3.4%, 
respectively. 
In Chile, although not statistically signiﬁcant, girls 
were found to have slightly higher rates of ADHD and 
ODD than boys. ADHD and externalizing disorders 
in general are almost universally higher in boys 
(Polanczyk & Rohde, 2007; Skounti, Philalithis, & 
Galanakis, 2007). Interestingly, although not sta- 
tistically signiﬁcant, higher rates for impulse control 
disorders among girls, which includes ADHD, were 
noted in the Mexican CIDI-A study (Benjet, Borges, 
Medina-Mora, Mendez, et al., 2009) and in a Brazil- 
ian ADHD school-based investigation (Rohde et al., 
1999). In a prevalence study of ADHD in Venezuela 
of 1141 school children, the rates were also noted to 
be higher among girls (Montiel-Nava et al., 2002). 
The reasons why elevated rates in girls or nearly 
equal rates with boys have been found in some Latin 
American epidemiological studies for ADHD merit 
further research. 

Conclusion 
This nationally representative study of mental dis- 
orders in children and adolescents highlights the 
extraordinarily high treatment gap that exists for 
child and adolescent mental health services in the 
region. Further information in Latin America is 
needed on how mental health care is provided to 
children and adolescents in Latin America. A 2003 
review of mental health care for children and ado- 
lescents in Latin America reported that data on 
treatment gap did not exist (Duarte et al., 2003). 
Undoubtedly, what Polanczyk et al. (2008) stated 
about treatment of ADHD in Latin America may be 
true for all disorders, that the type of psychosocial 
treatment used in community settings is frequently 
not empirically supported and the existing resources 
for effective treatment are scarce. Berganza (2005), 
in an editorial on the state of child mental health 
care in Latin America, argued that the current status 
of care in the region was a violation of children’s 
rights. This study in Chile highlights the increasing 
need to re-evaluate mental health services in the 
region.
