Abstract 
Depression has been increasing rapidly and is prevalent among youth. 
Inadequate mental health service utilization for youth and relevant racial/ 
ethnic disparities are a growing concern. The current study used a nationally 
representative database to examine racial/ethnic disparities in youth 
depression prevalence, mental health services utilization, and psychotropic 
medication receipt. The sequential examination shows that depressed 
minority youth (22%-30%) were not only much less likely to use specialty 
mental health services than depressed Caucasian and multiracial youth 
(40%-43%, p < .001), they were also much less likely to receive psychotropic 
medications (22%-30%) than their Caucasian and multiracial counterparts 
(38%-44%, p = .048 to <.001) when using specialty mental health services. 
The findings reveal possibly two levels of racial/ethnic disparities at the 
decision points of accessing specialty mental health services and subsequent

Depression has rapidly evolved from a rare phenomenon to a common symp- 
tom in youth population over the past several decades, with about 13% of 
children 12 to 17 years old ever experiencing a Major Depressive Episode 
(MDE) in their lifetime (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 
2018b). Depression is often characterized by chronic or frequently recurring 
episodes, and is often comorbid with other psychiatric conditions such as 
anxiety, externalizing disorders, and substance use (Zahn-Waxler, Shirtcliff, 
& Marceau, 2008). Depression is one of the leading causes of disability and 
a major risk factor for suicide. More than half of depressed youth suffer from 
daily life functional impairment, learning difficulties, or other dysfunctional 
living situations (Merikangas et al., 2010), and depression is implicated in 
nearly half of youth suicidalities (Thapar, Collishaw, Pine, & Thapar, 2012). 
In addition, early onset of depression is also associated with treatment resis- 
tant depression later in life (Hatcher-Kay & King, 2003). 
Racial/ethnic disparities in youth mental health utilization have long been 
a concern. Mental health services can be distinguished between specialty and 
non-specialty services. Specialty services are typically provided in special- 
ized mental health service facilities, which can be further categorized into 
inpatient and outpatient services, while non-specialty services often refer to 
services provided by non-mental health professionals or at school-based set- 
tings (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2017; Garland 
et al., 2005; Gudiño, Lau, Yeh, McCabe, & Hough, 2009; Zhang, Smith, & 
Tabb, 2018). 
Nationally, less than four tenths of youth with an MDE in the past year 
received mental health services (Cummings & Druss, 2011; Zhang et al., 
2018). Significant racial/ethnic disparities persist despite continuous efforts 
aimed at reducing the disparities (Alegria, Vallas, & Pumariega, 2010). When 
compared with depressed Caucasian youth, African American and Hispanic 
depressed youth were about one fifth less likely to receive treatment, while 
Asian American depressed youth were about half as likely (Cummings & 
Druss, 2011). A recent national study shows that depressed African American 
and Hispanic youth were about 30% to 40% less likely to receive specialty 


mental health services than depressed Caucasian youth, although there was 
no difference in the use of non-specialty services (Zhang et al., 2018). 
The disparity is similarly manifested among youth who are in public care 
systems. Studies examining youth 6 to 18 years old in the public care system 
including child welfare, juvenile justice, special education, alcohol and drug 
abuse, and mental health service sectors found that more than two thirds of 
Caucasian youth used formal outpatient services compared with about half of 
the Latino and African American youth and one third of the Asian American 
youth, but there was no significant difference in the use of non-specialty ser- 
vices (Garland et al., 2005). The findings concerning racial/ethnic disparities 
of non-specialty mental health tend to be mixed, with some suggesting the 
existence of such disparities in school settings (Bear, Finer, Guo, & Lau, 
2014; Guo, Kataoka, Bear, & Lau, 2014) while others not when examining 
the general youth population or youth in a large public care system (Garland 
et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2018). 
Racial/ethnic disparities in mental health service use are also reflected in 
the choice of treatment methods, particularly in the use of psychotropic medi- 
cations for treatment. Trial evidence has suggested that psychotropic medica- 
tions are effective in the treatment of youth mental health problems including 
depressive symptoms, in particular, for younger youth, boys, and youth with 
less severe depressive symptoms (Strawn, Dobson, & Giles, 2017). However, 
the use of psychotropic medications among youth has been controversial 
(Loy, Merry, & Hetrick, 2012; Olfson, Blanco, Liu, Wang, & Correll, 2012) 
due to concerns of inadequate evidence showing efficacy (Loy et al., 2012; 
Morris & Stone, 2011; Olfson et al., 2012) and potential risks such as suicid- 
alities (Vries, Jonge, Kalverdijk, & Bos, 2016), weight gain (Loy et al., 2012), 
and diabetes (Hammerman, Dreiher, & Klang, 2008). Despite such concerns, 
psychotropic medication use, especially off-label use (usage for symptoms 
not indicated by authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
[FDA]), on the clinical youth population has increased dramatically over 
time (Loy et al., 2012; Olfson et al., 2012; Vries et al., 2016). For example, 
the use of antipsychotics for children increased eightfold in the decade after 
the mid-1990s, with about half of the prescriptions being considered off-label 
(Alexander, Gallagher, Mascola, Moloney, & Stafford, 2012). The rapid 
expansion has made youth even more likely to receive antipsychotic pre- 
scriptions from psychiatrists than older adults (Olfson et al., 2012). 
Similar to mental health service use, substantial racial/ethnic disparities 
exist in the use of psychotropic medications for the treatment of depression in 
youth. About one fifth of Caucasian youth with a past year MDE received 
psychotropic medications for treatment, which was about 2 to 3 times that of 


African American and Hispanic counterparts, and 5 times that of Asian coun- 
terparts after adjusting demographic and other factors (Cummings & Druss, 
2011). The disparity pattern largely persists as shown in a more recent 
national study (Zhang et al., 2018). Research examining youth enrolled in a 
state Medicaid program revealed similar patterns, where White youths were 
about 2.2 to 3.8 times more likely to receive psychotropic medications than 
African American youth after adjusting other factors (Zito, Safer, Zuckerman, 
Gardner, & Soeken, 2005). 
Various factors may contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in mental health 
services use. Mental health–associated stigma may compromise youth men- 
tal health services access (Radovic et al., 2015; Richardson, 2001), and it is 
often amplified in minority cultural contexts (Guo et al., 2014). For example, 
compared with Caucasian youth, Asian American youth were less willing to 
express mental health problems and service needs because they tend to view 
them as a burden to family and friends (Guo et al., 2014). 
Minority youth, especially African American and Hispanic youth, are 
often in socioeconomically disadvantaged families, whose financial hardship 
and lack of insurance are often barriers to mental health services (Kataoka, 
Zhang, & Wells, 2002; Santiago, Kaltman, & Miranda, 2013; Wirback, 
Möller, Larsson, & Engström, 2018). However, income alone may not suffi- 
ciently reflect the profound impact of economic disadvantages on youth men- 
tal health services use (Cummings & Druss, 2011). Recent statewide studies 
in Ohio and New York revealed that youth mental health seeking was a bur- 
densome process and typically required 40 to 50 days waiting time (Gallo 
et al., 2018; Olin & Clark, 2016; Steinman, Shoben, Dembe, & Kelleher, 
2015). Parents of African American and Hispanic youth often work on ben- 
efits stringent jobs (Patten, 2017; Rae, Claxton, Levitt, & McDermott, 2019), 
which may limit their accommodation of youth mental health service seek- 
ing. Referential systems may also play a role. Compared with Caucasian 
youth, African American youth with moderate mental health symptoms were 
found less likely to be referred to needed mental health services; and they 
also tended to receive services with inferior quality (Alegría, Lin, & Green, 
2012; Alegria et al., 2010; Snowden, 2003). 
Despite extensive research on racial/ethnic disparities concerning youth 
mental health service use, there are noticeable limitations. Many studies 
examine mental health service access and psychotropic medication use sepa- 
rately rather than sequentially, which makes it hard to tell whether the racial/ 
ethnic disparity in medication use is due to the variation in mental health 
service initiation, or indicates another race/ethnicity-related decision dispar- 
ity in the treatment process. To address the limitations, the current study used 
a nationally representative database to examine (a) among all youth, the 


racial/ethnic variation of youth depression prevalence; (b) among the 
depressed youth, the racial/ethnic disparity concerning the use of specialty 
and non-specialty mental health services; and (c) among the depressed youth 
who received specialty mental health services, the racial/ethnic disparity con- 
cerning psychotropic medication use. In addition, most studies that examined 
racial/ethnic disparities did not distinguish youth of two or more races/eth- 
nicities from other groups, although the proportion of individuals identifying 
as of two or more races/ethnicities has been increasing dramatically. In our 
analysis, we included youth identifying as of two or more races/ethnicities as 
a stand-alone group for examination. 


The sample consisted of 7 years of pooled data (2010-2016) derived from the 
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), a nationally representa- 
tive study that annually surveyed non-institutionalized individuals 12 years 
and older in the U.S. civilian population across all 50 states and the District 
of Columbia. About one quarter to one third of the annual NSDUH survey 
respondents were youth 12 to 17 years old, and these respondents were used 
as the base to examine the prevalence of youth’s past year and lifetime 
depression (n = 131,777). Furthermore, the study focused on youth who had 
a past year MDE to examine racial/ethnic discrepancies in their use of spe- 
cialty and non-specialty mental health services (n = 11,553). Finally, the 
study examined racial/ethnic discrepancies of receiving psychotropic pre- 
scriptions (Rx) among youth who had a past year MDE and received spe- 
cialty mental health services (n = 4,380). 
Measures. Youth with lifetime and past year MDE were measured using 
an adapted version of the depression section of the National Comorbidity 
Survey–Youth derived from the World Health Organization Composite Inter- 
national Diagnostic Interview–Short Form (CIDI-SF; Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration, 2017). The CIDI-SF has been vali- 
dated to show good psychometric concordance with the full CIDI (Kessler, 
Andrews, & Mroczek, 1998). Youth were coded as whether having a past 
year or lifetime MDE (yes/no) based on the criteria (Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration, 2017). 
As defined by the NSDUH (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration, 2017), specialty mental health services (yes/no) indicated 
whether a youth reported receiving mental health services in the past year 


from any of six specialty inpatient/residential or outpatient sources for non- 
alcohol or drug-related behavior or emotional problem: a hospital, residential 
treatment facility, day treatment facility, mental health clinic, private thera- 
pist, and in-home therapist. Specialty mental health services can be distin- 
guished into inpatient and outpatient services (Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration, 2017). Inpatient services (yes/no) indicated 
whether a youth received specialty mental health services from an overnight 
stay in a hospital or residential treatment facility. Outpatient services (yes/no) 
indicated whether a youth received specialty mental health outpatient ser- 
vices from a day treatment facility, mental health clinic, private therapist, or 
in-home therapist. Non-specialty mental health services (yes/no) indicated 
whether a youth reported receiving mental health services in the past year 
from any of five specific non-specialty sources for non-alcohol or drug- 
related behavior or emotional problem: a school social worker, school psy- 
chologist, or school counselor; a special school or program within a regular 
school for students with emotional or behavioral problems; a pediatrician or 
other family doctor; a juvenile detention center, prison, or jail; and/or foster 
care or therapeutic foster care (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration, 2017). 
Rx (psychotropic medication) use (yes/no) indicated whether youth were 
prescribed with psychotropic medications for their MDE in the past year 
(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2017). Nearly 
all youth who received Rx for MDE had received specialty mental health 
services. Overnight stay/visit indicated the number of nights or visits youth 
made to specialty mental health services or settings, and was an ordered vari- 
able (0, 1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 24, 25 and more stays or visits). 
Family structure is derived from two questions that asked youth if their 
mother or father were at home to indicate three family types: two-parent fam- 
ilies, single-parent families, and non-parent families based on whether both 
parents were at home, one parent was at home, or no parent was at home. 
Youth mental health was closely associated with behavioral problems 
(Fearn et al., 2016; Pickering & Kaplan, 2006; Vaughn, Nelson, Salas-Wright, 
DeLisi, & Qian, 2016; Vaughn, Salas-Wright, DeLisi, & Maynard, 2014). 
Two dichotomous variables (yes/no) were used to indicate whether youth had 
alcohol and illicit drug abuse or dependence problems. In addition, antisocial 
behavioral problems (yes/no) indicated whether youth had reported any of 
the following antisocial behaviors: serious fight at school or work, group 
fight, carrying a handgun, selling illegal drugs, stealing or trying to steal item 
more than US$50, and attacking with intent to seriously harm. 
For youth with a past year MDE, function impairment due to depressive 
symptoms was measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), which 


assessed the severity of function impairment in four domains of daily life, 
including chores at home, school, or work; family; and social life. The vari- 
able was coded as severe or very severe versus moderate or less severe based 
on the most severe rating across the four domains (Leon, Olfson, Portera, 
Farber, & Sheehan, 1997; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration, 2017). 
Other variables include race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White or Caucasian, 
African American, Hispanic, Asian, two or more races, and Other), age 
(12-13, 14-15, 16-17), gender (male/female), self-rated health status (excel- 
lent or very good vs. good or below), household income (less than US$50,000 
vs. US$50,000 or more), having health insurance coverage (yes/no), region 
(large metro, medium metro, and non-metro), and survey year (from 2010 to 
2017). 
Analytical methods. We first conducted descriptive analyses to present 
sample characteristics across six racial/ethnic groups, which were based 
on the whole youth population in the sample. Next, we conducted bivariate 
analyses to examined racial/ethnic discrepancies in the use of specialty and 
non-specialty mental health services, Rx, and the mean overnight stays/visits, 
which were based on youth who were identified as having a past year MDE. 
Third, we used three logistic regression models to examine the association 
between race/ethnicity and three outcome variables: whether youth had a past 
year MDE, whether youth who were identified as having a past year MDE 
used specialty mental health services, and whether those who were identified 
as having a past year MDE and received specialty mental health services 
were prescribed with Rx. Finally, we estimated the probabilities of youth 
experiencing a past year MDE, using specialty mental health services, and 
receiving Rx across racial/ethnic groups after adjusting confounding factors 
based on the outputs from the logistic regression models. Following weight- 
ing strategies suggested for NSDUH (Center for Behavioral Health Statis- 
tics and Quality, 2018a; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive, 
2014), STATA svyset and svy procedures were used to account for the com- 
plex survey design so that the estimates were representative of the national 
non-institutionalized youth population. 


There were slight age differences but no difference in gender composition 
across racial/ethnic groups. Most youth (69.35%) were in two-parent families, 


but African American youth (42.42%) had a comparatively lower rate. Slightly 
more than half (52.96%) of the youth were in a family with income US$50,000 
or more, but African American (28.01%) and Hispanic (32.09%) youth were 
at a substantially lower rate (p < .001). About three quarters (75.94%) of the 
youth rated their health status as excellent or very good, but the “Other” race/ 
ethnicity group (64.64%, p < .001) were less likely to do so. Most (93.97%) 
youth had health insurance coverage, but the rate for Hispanic youth (87.65%, 
p < .001) was comparatively lower. On average, 3.1% of the youth had alco- 
hol abuse or dependence problems, but the rate for Asian American (1.2%) 
and African American youth (1.65%, p < .001) was comparatively lower. On 
average, 3.85% of youth had illicit drug abuse or dependence problems, with 
Hispanic (4.51%) and “Other” race/ethnicity youth (5.05%) having the high- 
est rate, and Asian American youth (1.57%, p < .001) having the lowest rate. 
More than one quarter (27.82%) of youth had some type of antisocial behavior 
in the past year, with African American youth (36.51%), youth who identified 
as of two or more races (33.09%), and “Other” race/ethnicity youth (37.2%) 
having a higher rate, and Asian American youth (17.75%) having a lower rate. 
Slightly more than half of the youth (54.85%) lived in a large metro area, with 
the highest rate for Asian American youth (77.27%), and the lowest rate for 
the “Other” race/ethnicity youth (35.75%, p < .001; see Table 1). 
Overall, about one in six (15.37%) youth experienced an MDE in their 
lifetime, and the rate of experiencing an MDE in the past year was about one 
in 10 (10.45%). African American youth had the lowest lifetime (12.57%) 
and past year (8.08%) MDE, while youth who identified as of two or more 
races had the highest lifetime (18.26%) and past year (12.77%, p < .001) 
MDE. Among youth with a past year MDE, the majority (70.87%) were iden- 
tified as having severe to very severe functional impairment due to MDE, but 
there was no noticeable difference across race/ethnicity (Table 1). 

Table 2 presents the use of different types of mental health services among 
youth who were identified as having a past year MDE. On average, more than 
one third (36.54%) of youth with a past year MDE received specialty mental 
health services, with a small fraction of them (6.28%) receiving inpatient 
services, and most of them (35.58%) receiving outpatient services. Caucasian 
(40.71%) and youth who identify as of two or more races (45.54%) were 
most likely to receive specialty services, while Asian American (21.77%) 
youth were least likely to receive specialty services (p < .001). Racial dis- 
parities in specialty mental health services were reflected in the use of spe- 
cialty outpatient services (p < .001), however, there were no significant 








 
 








 
 


racial discrepancies in the use of inpatient services. About one third (34.04%) 
of youth received non-specialty mental health services, and there were no 
significant racial/ethnic discrepancies. A little less than one fifth (17.96%) of 
youth who were identified as having a past year MDE received Rx, with 
Caucasian (22.09%) and youth who identified as of two or more races 
(22.96%) at the highest rate and Asian American (8.73%) youth at the lowest 
rate (p < .001). Youth with a past year MDE, on average, had 1.29 (SE = 0.03) 
overnight stays in, or visits to, specialty mental health services, with 
Caucasian (M = 1.47, SE = 0.04) and youth who identified as of two or more 
races (M = 1.38, SE = 0.15) at a higher than average number and Asian 
American (M = 0.85, SE = 0.17) youth at a lower than average number. 

Table 3 presents the results from logistic regression models that used race/ 
ethnicity and other covariates to predict three outcome variables: past year 
MDE prevalence in the youth population; the use of any specialty mental 
health service in the past year among youth who were identified as having a 
past year MDE, and the receipt of Rx among youth who were identified as 
having a past year MDE and also received specialty mental health services. 
When examining factors associated with youth having a past year MDE 
(Table 3, Model 1), minority youth (except for Asian American youth and 
youth who identified as of two or more races) had a 11% to 40% lower 
odds of experiencing a past year MDE than Caucasian youth (odds ratio 
[OR] = 0.6-0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.55, 0.98]). Among the 
covariates, older youth (14-17 vs. 12-13 years old), being in single-parent 
or non-parent families (vs. two-parent families), having alcohol and illicit 
drug abuse or dependence, having antisocial behavior, and being included 
in the survey in more recent years (2012 and later vs. 2010) were all signifi- 
cantly associated with a higher odds of experiencing a past year MDE. 
However, being male, reporting excellent or very good health, and living in 
non-metro rather than metro areas, were significantly associated with lower 
odds of experiencing a past year MDE (Table 3, Model 1). 
When examining factors associated with receiving specialty mental health 
services among youth having a past year MDE (Table 3, Model 2), minority 
youth (except for those who identified as of two or more races and the “Other” 
race youth group) had a 44% to 67% lower odds of receiving specialty 
mental health services for MDE than Caucasian youth (OR = 0.43-0.66, 
95% CI = [0.29, 0.76]). Among the covariates, being in single-parent or 
non-parent families (vs. two-parent families), having a family income of 
US$50,000 or higher, having severe or very severe functional impairment 




 




 


due to an MDE, having alcohol and illicit drug abuse or dependence, having 
antisocial behavior, and being included in the survey in more recent years 
(2014 and 2016 vs. 2010) were all significantly associated with a higher odds 
of receiving specialty mental health services. However, being male, reporting 
excellent or very good health, and no insurance coverage were significantly 
associated with lower odds of receiving specialty mental health services 
(Table 3, Model 2). 
When examining factors associated with receiving Rx for youth who were 
identified as having a past year MDE and who also received specialty mental 
health services (Table 3, Model 3), minority youth (except for those who 
identified as of two or more races) had a 47% to 74% lower odds of receiving 
Rx than Caucasian youth (OR = 0.36-0.53, 95% CI = [0.16, 0.99]). Among 
the covariates, older youth (14-17 vs. 12-13 years old), being in non-parent 
families (vs. two-parent families), having severe or very severe functional 
impairment due to an MDE, having alcohol and illicit drug abuse or depen- 
dence, and being included in the survey in more recent years (2014-2016 vs. 
2010) were all significantly associated with higher odds of receiving Rx. 
However, having a family income of US$50,000 or higher, reporting excel- 
lent or very good health, and no insurance coverage were significantly asso- 
ciated with lower odds of receiving Rx (Table 3, Model 3). 
Figure 1 was based on the model outputs presented in Table 3 to visual- 
ize the predicted probability of youth experiencing a past year MDE, using 
specialty mental health services, and receiving Rx after controlling for 
confounding factors. The predicted risk of having a past year MDE was 
similar across racial/ethnic groups (8%-9%) except that African American 
and “Other” youth were somewhat lower (5%-6%, p = .008 to <.001). 
Among youth with a past year MDE, the predicted probability of using 
specialty mental health among minority youth (22%-30%, p < .001) was 
substantially lower than Caucasian youth (40%) and youth of two or more 
races (43%). Among youth who had a past year MDE and received spe- 
cialty mental health services, the predicted probability of receiving Rx 
among minority youth (22%-30%, p = .048 to <.001) was also substan- 
tially lower than Caucasian youth (44%) and youth of two or more races 
(38%) (Figure 1). 

Using a large nationally representative database, the study examined racial/ 
ethnic disparities on depression prevalence and the use of mental health ser- 
vices and psychotropic medications among youth 12 to 17. Distinctive from 
previous studies, the current study treated accessing mental health services

Note. Percentages were derived from models in Table 3, adjusting for race, age, gender, family

and use of psychotropic medications as sequential decision points and 
revealed multilevel racial/ethnic disparities throughout the process. 
Our findings indicate that, on average, about one sixth of youth (15.37%) 
experienced a past year MDE, with the highest percentage among youth of 
two or more races (18.26%) and the lowest proportion among African 
American youth (12.57%) (Table 1). The rates for non-Hispanic White, 
Hispanic, and Asian American youth range from 13.87% to 15.97%. These 
findings are generally consistent with those of previous research (Center for 
Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2017; Cummings & Druss, 2011). 
They also further highlight multiracial youth’s especially high risk of experi- 
encing depression, which is consistent with findings from emerging research 
in the area, such as a study that examined a large sample of high school stu- 
dents (Fisher, Reynolds, Hsu, Barnes, & Tyler, 2014). Today, more than 17% 
of married couples are interracial, and 14% of offspring identify as multira- 
cial (Bialik, 2017). Due to the growth among this population, it is important 
to pay close attention to their high mental health risks and service needs. 
By focusing on youth with a past year MDE, we examined racial/ethnic 
disparities of youth accessing mental health services based on whether 
depressed youth ever used non-specialty and specialty mental health services. 
The findings are consistent with previous findings that only a small proportion 


of youth in need of mental health services seek specialty mental health ser- 
vices, and there are substantial racial/ethnic disparities (Cummings & Druss, 
2011; Garland et al., 2005; Gudiño et al., 2009). After adjusting covariates, 
depressed youth of two or more races (43%) and Caucasian youth (40%) are 
much more likely to use specialty mental health services than depressed 
minority youth (22%-30%, p < .001; Figure 1). Further breakdown analyses 
suggest that the racial/ethnic disparities are mainly manifested in the use of 
outpatient services but not inpatient services (Table 2). The inconsistency 
between outpatient and inpatient services may be due to the difference of case 
nature. Depressed youth who seek inpatient services are likely under serious 
conditions that require immediate specialty treatment. In such cases, factors 
contributing to racial/ethnic disparities such as parental perceptions of mental 
health services may be less influential as they are with less imminent cases 
that usually seek outpatient services. 
The patterns of racial/ethnic disparities among specialty service utilizers as 
indicated in the bivariate analyses (Table 2) are confirmed by the multivariate 
analyses that control for various confounding factors including clinical, fam- 
ily, social, economic, and other characteristics (Table 3 and Figure 1). Among 
covariates, income is not linked to specialty mental health services use dis- 
parities in depressed youth, but having no health insurance coverage is linked 
to lower likelihood of using specialty services (Table 3), which support previ- 
ous findings that health insurance coverage is fundamental to meet mental 
health service needs regardless of family income levels (Cummings & Druss, 
2011). The findings also suggest the need of examining family social eco- 
nomic status more than income to understand its impact on mental health ser- 
vices usage, because family social economic status related factors such as 
caregivers’ time flexibility, social support, parenting skills, and communica- 
tion efficacy with service providers have been found to be closely linked to 
youth mental health access (Gallo et al., 2018; Harrison, McKay, & Bannon, 
2004; Olin & Clark, 2016; Steinman et al., 2015). 
The prominent racial/ethnic disparities in specialty mental health service 
use may be attributted to racial/ethnic disaprites of parental and youth per- 
ceptions of mental health services (Alegria et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2014; 
Sherman & Ali, 2017). Perceptions of mental health services are often linked 
to stigma (Clement et al., 2015; Lindsey, Joe, & Nebbitt, 2010) that affects 
minority youth most significantly (Eisenberg, Downs, Golberstein, & Zivin, 
2009; Guo, Nguyen, Weiss, Ngo, & Lau, 2015). For example, compared with 
people of other cultural backgrounds, Asian Americans are more likely to 
stress the importance of contributing to family and friends while avoiding 
“bothering” them with issues such as mental health problems, leading to 
restrictions in expressing mental health needs and services seeking (Guo 


et al., 2014; Kim, Sherman, & Taylor, 2008; Telzer & Fuligni, 2009). A 
national study showed that African Americans are more likely to link mental 
health problems such as depression to violent behavior (Anglin, Alberti, 
Link, & Phelan, 2008). Another contributor to racial/ethnic variation of per- 
ceptions on mental health services may derive from mental health literacy. 
Research has suggested that youth whose parents recognize youth internal- 
izing mental health problems are much more likely to use mental health ser- 
vices than youth whose parents do not (Breland et al., 2014), while minority 
families are more likely to lack such mental health literacy and service 
resources (Abe-Kim et al., 2007; Gudiño et al., 2009). 
About one third of depressed youth in our sample received non-specialty 
mental health services, and there were few racial/ethnic disparities. Non- 
specialty services such as counseling services by school psychologists and 
social workers are more likely to be initiated by non-parental adults, and thus 
may be less subject to the influence of parental perceptions and other racial/ 
ethnic-related factors. For example, previous studies have suggested that 
there are few racial/ethnic disparities in school-based youth mental health 
service identification and referrals (Alegría et al., 2012). 
The most interesting findings are the revelation of racial/ethnic disparities 
in psychotropic medication use among depressed youth who received spe- 
cialty mental health services. We limited the sample for the examination to 
youth who were identified as having a past year MDE and also used specialty 
services, which eliminates the possibility that the disparities may be caused 
by racial/ethnic variation in the use of specialty mental health services among 
depressed youth. The results show that among depressed youth who also used 
specialty mental health services, Caucasian youth (44%) and youth of two or 
more races (38%) were much more likely to receive psychotropic medica- 
tions than their counterparts of other racial/ethnic groups (22%-30%, p = 
.048 to <.001), after controlling for confounding factors (Figure 1). The find- 
ings advance the understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in youth mental 
health service utilization. Previous studies usually examined racial/ethnic 
disparities in psychotropic medication use among the whole youth population 
or among youth who were identified as having depression or other mental 
health symptoms (Cummings & Druss, 2011; Marcus & Olfson, 2010; 
Olfson, Druss, & Marcus, 2015). Such analyses could not disentangle whether 
the disparities in psychotropic medication use were due to racial/ethnic varia- 
tion of service initiation, or actually signaled an additional racial/ethnic dis- 
parity after mental health service initiation. Our current two-stage analyses 
resolved such an issue, and the results tend to suggest that racial/ethnic dis- 
parities occur not only when depressed youth and families decide to use 


specialty mental health services but also, additionally, at the time when they 
receive psychotropic medications after initiating the specialty services. 
Given the fact that youth in disadvantaged settings such as the child wel- 
fare system or Medicaid are often more likely to be prescribed with psycho- 
tropic medications (Bellonci et al., 2013; Brenner, Southerland, Burns, 
Wagner, & Farmer, 2014; Lee, Walker, & Bishop, 2016), it is unlikely that 
mental health professionals would be less willing to prescribe psychotropic 
medications to depressed minority youth. More likely, minority youth and 
their caregivers’ preferences and perceptions play an important role that leads 
to the racial/ethnic disparities in psychotropic medication use. Studies have 
suggested that youth and their parents prefer psychotherapeutic treatment and 
express concerns toward psychotic medications (Bradley, McGrath, Brannen, 
& Bagnell, 2010; McHugh, Whitton, Peckham, Welge, & Otto, 2013). 
Furthermore, studies have found that depressed African American patients 
viewed antidepressants as less acceptable than non-Hispanic White patients 
(Cooper et al., 2003), and African American adults were less willing to use 
psychotropic medications for themselves or children (Schnittker, Freese, & 
Powell, 2000). About two thirds of African Americans relative to more than 
one third of Caucasians were concerned that patients were treated as unin- 
formed experimental participants when receiving prescriptions from physi- 
cians (Corbie-Smith, Thomas, & St. George, 2002). 
Compared with their counterparts of Caucasian and youth of two or more 
races, depressed minority youth are not only less likely to initiate specialty 
mental health services, but also less likely to receive psychotropic medications 
after they initiate the services. Such disparities suggest that concerns toward 
psychotropic medication prescriptions may inhibit youth seeking needed men- 
tal health services from the beginning. Given that minority youth especially 
African American youth and their parents have a higher level of concern 
toward psychotropic medications than their Caucasian counterparts (Cooper 
et al., 2003; Schnittker et al., 2000), depressed minority youth and their par- 
ents may be especially concerned that mental health treatment is affiliated 
with psychotropic medication use and try to avoid initiating the services. The 
dramatic increase in psychotropic medication use among youth clinical popu- 
lation along with the concerns about their largely off-label use, efficiency, and 
risks (Loy et al., 2012; Morris & Stone, 2011; Olfson et al., 2012; Vries et al., 
2016) may further feed such a deterring effect. Future research is needed to 
further examine the possible link between the perception of psychotropic 
medications and the initiation of mental health services. 
There are limitations in the study. First, NSDUH only surveys general 
populations but not homeless and institutionalized youth such as youth in the 
juvenile systems who may have a different pattern on the examined 


outcomes. This limits the scope of the findings’ implications. Second, the 
accuracy of MDE and some other key measures remains a concern. 
Researchers have long been concerned that culturally based mental health 
reporting may bias the estimation. For example, Asian Americans’ low preva- 
lence of mental health problems and service use may be attributed to poten- 
tial underreporting because of a strong stigma attached to these issues in 
Asian culture. This may be further complicated by language barriers and 
Western culture–based mental health definitions that can overlook symptoms 
unique to Asian populations (Sue, Cheng, Saad, & Chu, 2012). Finally, 
despite rich information in the database, NSDUH surveys only asked whether 
youth took prescribed medications for MDE symptoms in the past year. This 
limits further exploration of racial/ethnic disparities in other important 
dimensions such as the use of multiple types of medications and length in 
medications (dosReis et al., 2011). 

Racial/ethnic disparities in the use of mental health services and psychotro- 
pic medications are serious public health concerns, and it is important to 
advance the understanding of such disparities for more responsive policy 
and practice considerations. Our findings reveal that youth of two or more 
races are at the highest risk of experiencing depression and deserve special 
attention, especially with their sizable and increasing proportion in the youth 
population. The study reveals similar patterns of racial/ethnic disparities at 
the decision points of accessing specialty mental health services and subse- 
quent use of psychotropic medications, which suggest that race/ethnicity is 
associated with not only the initiation of specialty mental health service use 
but also the choice of mental health treatment methods. One plausible expla- 
nation is that service-needing youth and their families’ concerns on psycho- 
tropic medication may deter their initiation of mental health services use, 
and such concerns may be more amplified in minority youth and their care- 
givers than their Caucasian counterparts (Cooper et al., 2003; Schnittker 
et al., 2000; Sue et al., 2012). If this is the case, it is important to strengthen 
rigorous evidence that shows psychotropic medications’ efficacy and low 
risks on youth clinical populations to reduce such concerns to achieve both 
an improvement in access to mental health services and a reduction of racial/ 
ethnic disparities. It may also highlight the importance of promoting evi- 
dence-based psychotherapeutic treatment for youth mental health treatment, 
which has been well accepted by the youth and parents (Watanabe, Hunot, 
Omori, Churchill, & Furukawa, 2007). Future research is needed to disen- 
tangle causes underlying racial/ethnic disparities between the use of 


specialty mental health services and psychotropic medications to verify such 
an assumption for policy and practice considerations.
