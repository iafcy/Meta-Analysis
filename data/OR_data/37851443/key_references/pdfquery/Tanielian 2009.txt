Purpose: To examine readiness for treatment among adolescents with depression in primary care. 
Methods: This article draws upon data from 184 depressed patients, aged 13 to 17, who participated 
in the Teen Depression Awareness Project. Adolescents were screened assessed along a number of 
domains at baseline and 6 months. 
Results: Seventy-eight percent of the depressed teens acknowledged they had a problem with depres- 
sion, yet only 25% were currently getting any sort of counseling or treatment for depression. A total of 
40.8% of depressed adolescents were ‘‘ready’’ to get care, whereas 26.6% were ‘‘unsure’’ and 32.1% 
were ‘‘not ready.’’ Signiﬁcant differences among these groups were observed for race/ethnicity and 
household income. Adolescents in the ready group also had more depressive symptoms and lower 
MHI-5 scores. Being in the ready group versus being ‘‘unsure’’ was a signiﬁcant predictor of service 
use at the 6-month follow-up, as was the average number of days impaired and overall mental health 
functioning. Race, gender, and age were not signiﬁcant predictors of readiness, yet average number of 
depressive symptoms was signiﬁcantly associated with greater readiness. 
Conclusions: Because teens in primary care settings are not seeking mental health treatments even 
when depression is detected, providers should be mindful that adolescents may be at different stages 
of recognition and readiness for treatment. Teens who are less ready for care may need follow-up 
primary care visits or consultation to help them become more active in seeking care. (cid:2) 2009

Depressive disorders occur in roughly 20% of American 
youth by age 18 [1] and have deleterious effects on academic, 
social, and health functioning [2–4]. Although psychosocial 
and pharmacological treatments have demonstrated efﬁcacy 
for depressive disorders [5,6], many adolescents do not 
receive them. Primary care is a promising venue for treatment 
for depression because most adolescents have contact with 
a primary care provider, and primary care is a common site 
for depression treatment [7–10]. Further, research has shown 
that efforts to improve depression treatment for adults in 
primary care have paid off [11,12]. Nevertheless, many 
adolescents with depression fail to seek care [3,13]. How 



adolescents and their parents conceptualize symptoms and 
emotional problems as well as what burden the illness places 
on the family may play a critical role in whether adolescents 
seek care or adhere to treatment plans [14–16]. Decisions 
about getting treatment, as well as what type of treatment 
to seek, may depend on whether one is motivated to seek 
care. Whether an adolescent is ready to address his or her 
depression and to consider treatment may predict interest 
in, acceptance of, and adherence to treatment. Prochaska 
and DiClemente [17] conceptualize health behavior change 
as a process that involves progress through six stages—pre- 
contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, mainte- 
nance, and termination—and may help us understand why 
some adolescents do not seek care for their depression.

a sample of depressed teens drawn from primary care. It also 
examines the relationship between readiness for care and 
future service use. We address three speciﬁc questions: 
1. Which teens are ready to seek care for their depression? 
2. How is readiness to seek care associated with treatment 





Data are from Teen Depression Awareness Project and 
include 184 adolescent primary care patients aged 13 to 17 
years who screened positive for depression on a research 
diagnostic interview, and 170 parents of those adolescents 
[18,19]. Participants were recruited from seven healthcare 
organizations, across 11 sites (in the Los Angeles and Wash- 
ington, DC areas). We selected sites to maximize diversity of 
medical ofﬁces, including free, public, private-managed care, 
and private insurance, that served diverse patients in terms of 
ethnicity and race. 

Enrollment occurred between January 2005 and March 
2006, and consisted of approaching the adolescent (and 
parent/guardian, if present) at the medical ofﬁce, explaining 
the project and obtaining signed adolescent assent and 
parent/guardian consent (approved by the institutional review 
boards at RAND and each health organization, if applicable). 
After completing contact sheets in the primary care setting 
(refusal rates to complete the form among those approached 
varied by site and ranged from 1% to 40%), a total of 5407 
teens were contacted by phone for study enrollment and 
screening; 143 were determined to be ineligible (3%), 347 
refused study participation (6%), 204 (4%) could not be 
reached, and 4713 were enrolled in the study. Once enrolled, 
adolescents were interviewed via telephone to determine 
eligibility for participation (n ¼ 4713), using the Diagnostic 
Interview Schedule for Children [20–23] depression module. 
We deﬁned teens as ‘‘depressed’’ (n ¼ 187 or 3.97% of those 
screened) if they met criteria for a depressive episode of 2 
weeks or more in the prior 6 months, and reported at least 
three depressive symptoms in the prior 2 weeks, so as to 
include both currently depressed teens and those who 
reported a recent depressive episode and lingering symptoms 
at the time of assessment. Other inclusion criteria for the 
project included: currently attending school within 2 years 
of expected grade level, currently living with parent/ 
guardian, not currently pregnant, adolescent and parent 
speaking Spanish or English, and not having a sibling already 
enrolled in the study. Adolescents and parents who partici- 
pated in the study were interviewed (via Computer Assisted 
Telephone Interviews or CATI) at two points in time: imme- 
diately or shortly after the diagnostic interview, and again 
approximately 6 months later (n ¼ 184). Adolescents were 
assessed along several dimensions, including health status, 
symptoms of depression, emotional functioning, as well as 
knowledge/attitudes about treatment, and demographic char- 
acteristics. All adolescents received feedback via mail on 
their screening assessment, as well as an educational 
brochure about depression. Half of the depressed adolescents 
(randomly selected) also received a guide to local mental 
health resources and were scheduled to receive a telephone 
motivational intervention with the TDAP counselor. (More 
information about this telephone-based motivational inter- 
vention can obtained through the primary author.) The coun- 
selor made notes from these sessions that documented 
adolescents’ acknowledgment of depression and willingness 
to seek care. There were no signiﬁcant differences on the 
variables presented in this article between the teens who 
received those calls and those teens that did not at baseline 
or 6-month follow-up. 

The readiness for treatment measure was constructed by 
compiling responses from the baseline teen and parent inter- 
views. To create this measure, we ﬁrst created a six-point 
readiness variable and then collapsed the six levels into 
a three level variable for Ready, Unsure, and Not Ready. 
Using this measure, adolescents and parents were assigned 
to one of three groups: the Ready for Care group includes 
adolescents in treatment or working on getting treatment at 
the time of the interview. To be included in this group respon- 
dents indicated YES/AGREE to ‘‘Are you currently getting 
counseling, 
treatment or medications for depression?’’ 
(RTREAT ¼ 6) OR to ‘‘I am working on getting treatment’’ 
(RTREAT ¼ 5). The Unsure group includes adolescents that 
(at baseline) reported thinking about whether treatment 
would help or who reported thinking they should get treat- 
ment but had not sought care yet. Speciﬁcally respondents 
in this group indicated YES/AGREE to the following: ‘‘I 
think I 
for my depression’’ 
treatment 
(RTREAT ¼ 4) OR ‘‘I am thinking about whether or not 
treatment would help with my depression’’ (RTREAT ¼ 3). 
Finally, the Not Ready for Care group included adolescents 
who at baseline did not acknowledge having depression or 
who were not thinking about treatment. This group includes 
respondents who indicated YES to ‘‘Most teenagers are 
depressed at some time. Do you think you had a problem 
with depression in the last 4 weeks?’’ AND did not fall 
into ‘‘Ready for Care’’ (RTREAT ¼ 2) or ‘‘Unsure’’ above 
OR If the respondent indicated NO to ‘‘Most teenagers are 
depressed at some time. Do you think you had a problem 
with depression in the last 4 weeks?’’ (RTREAT ¼ 1). We 
used the same convention for the Parent variable; however, 
the items were worded to inquire about the teen ‘‘I am 
working on getting treatment for (his/her name).’’ 

We assessed mental health-related quality of life using the 
SF-12 [24]; however, modifying the item on physical 


impairments and replacing the word ‘‘work’’ with ‘‘school- 
work’’ to make the scale more relevant to adolescents. To 
assess mental health functioning, we added items from the 
Mental Health Index [24] and calculated the Mental Health 
Composite Score (MCS-12). We measured depressive symp- 
toms/severity using the Patient Health Questionnaire for 
Adolescents [25]. To assess number of depressive symptoms 
and depression severity, we created a new variable that added 
10 depression-related symptoms and assigned greater value 
to symptoms experienced ‘‘nearly every day’’ (value of 2) 
versus ‘‘for a few days’’ (value of 1). Symptoms that were 
not experienced were given a value of 0. To measure self- 
efﬁcacy, we asked adolescents to rate their conﬁdence in their 
own ability to overcome or control depression on a scale of 
0 to 10, where 10 equals as conﬁdent as they can be [26]. 
We assessed overall disability or days of impairment with 
the Sheehan Disability Scale [27], to produce a composite 
score for functional impairment. We also assessed experience 
with mental health treatment in the previous 6 months, using 
questions to determine if the adolescent had seen a provider 
or taken medication for an emotional problem in the previous 
6 months. A three-point service use measure (0, 1, 2) was 
constructed to assess intensity of treatment, based on the 
adolescent’s report of currently receiving counseling or anti- 
depressants for depression, where 0 is no treatment, 
1 ¼ either counseling or antidepressants, and 2 ¼ the combi- 
nation of counseling and antidepressants. We assessed pref- 
erence for treatment in the future (using a hypothetical need 
for treatment): no treatment, follow-up with a provider 
(‘‘watchful waiting’’), counseling only, medications only, 
or counseling and medications together. All 
items were 
assessed at baseline and repeated at the 6-month follow-up. 

During the CATI process, respondents were allowed to 
skip items they did not know or refused to answer, resulting 
in a small amount of missing data. A few items, such as 
household income and insurance type, were missing for the 
8% of adolescents whose parents did not complete the parent 
survey. Therefore, we used multiple imputation to impute 
ﬁve copies of the missing data elements and used these impu- 
tations to construct ﬁve replicates of completed data. All 
bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted ﬁve times 
on each data set and then results were combined using stan- 
dard multiple imputation rules [28,29] to obtain parameter 
estimates and their adjusted standard errors that reﬂect the 
uncertainty because of imputation. The amount of missing 
data was minimal; the most missing data occurred for the 
indicator that a teen had depression in the past 4 weeks 
(10% missing), with the next highest number of missing 
values for number of days impaired (2% missing). For both 
regression analyses presented in Tables 4 to 5, the relative 
increase in the variance of our estimates attributable to 
missing data was trivial (at most 2%) and the relative efﬁcien- 
cies of our multiple imputation-based estimates were almost 
one in all cases. 
We performed basic descriptive analyses of demographic 
and clinical characteristic and performed bivariate descrip- 
tive analyses to present the percentage of adolescents in 
each of the Readiness Groups by relevant demographic and 
clinical characteristics. Analysis of variance was used to 
test whether continuous individual characteristics (e.g., age, 
MHI-5, number of depressive symptoms, number of days 
impaired) signiﬁcantly varied by readiness for treatment. 
We examined Wald chi-squared test statistics for predictors 
in simple ordinal logistic regressions of readiness for treat- 
ment on categorical predictors to identify signiﬁcant bivariate 
associations. The SURVEYREG and SURVEYLOGISTIC 
procedures in SAS 9.1.4 were used so that bivariate signiﬁ- 
cance tests accounted for intracluster correlation among 
clients within treatment site. Testing bivariate associations 
using regression modeling also allowed us to combine results 
across analyses of multiple imputed data sets to account for 
uncertainty because of missing data. We examined the asso- 
ciation between clinical and demographic characteristics, 
readiness for treatment, and service use to assess what factors 
predict service use at 6-month follow-up. We also examined 
the association between clinical and demographic character- 
istics and readiness for treatment to assess what might predict 
readiness. To do this, we modeled readiness for treatment at 
baseline and service use at 6-month follow-up using multi- 
level ordinal logistic regressions as implemented in SAS 
Proc GLIMMIX [30]. We included a random intercept term 
in each model to account for intracluster correlation among 
clients within treatment site. We controlled for teen demo- 
graphic (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, and gender) and mental 
health characteristics (e.g., number of depressive symptoms, 
average number of days impaired, and MCS-12) in our anal- 
yses. We present adjusted odds ratios for each model coefﬁ- 
cient. We assessed the adequacy of the ordinal regression 
model ﬁt relative to multinomial 
logistic regression by 
comparing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) 
between models to see whether the additional complexity 
of the multinomial logistic regression model was warranted. 


Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteris- 
tics of depressed adolescents (n ¼ 184) and their parents 
(n ¼ 170). Depressed adolescents averaged 15.2 years of 
age, were mostly female (78.3%), and predominantly 
Hispanic (50.6%) or black (30.4%). Parents of the depressed 
adolescents averaged 44.2 years of age, were mostly female 
(89.4%) and predominantly Hispanic (47.0%) or black 
(32.7%). Almost half of the parent sample had at least 
some college education (45.0%) and just over a third 
(35.1%) reported household income of at least $50,000. 
Depressed adolescents had an average MHI-5 score of

sive symptoms in the past 4 weeks, and having been impaired 
an average of 12 days of the last 30. 
Adolescent and parent clinical characteristics and 
perceptions about treatment 
A total of 78.1% of adolescents acknowledged having 
a problem, and slightly more than a half (54.1%) of parents 
acknowledged their child had a problem (Table 2). A third 
of depressed adolescents (33.6%) reported that depression 
was a serious problem. Yet only one-quarter of the depressed 
adolescents (25.1%) reported currently being in treatment. 
With respect to readiness for treatment, we found 40.8% of 
depressed adolescents were ‘‘ready,’’ 26.6% were ‘‘unsure,’’ 
and 32.1% ‘‘not ready.’’ Slightly over a third (34.8%) re- 
ported receiving help from a mental health specialist in the 
prior 6 months. The majority of adolescents (based on a hypo- 
thetical need for help in the future) preferred counseling only 
(32.2%), followed by a combination of counseling and anti- 
depressant medications (22.4%); antidepressants alone were 
preferred only by 10.9% of depressed adolescents. Parents 
of these same adolescents, however, preferred some form 
of treatment to no treatment (no parent indicated a desire 
for no treatment as opposed to 16.9% of adolescents), and 
overwhelmingly preferred counseling only to other options 
(57.1% of parents preferred counseling only; less than 1% 
indicated a preference for medications only). 

Adolescents were compared along several demographic 
and clinical characteristics by readiness group (see Table 
3). More females were ready for treatment, although the 
difference was not statistically signiﬁcant, c2 (3) ¼ 3.70, 
p ¼.054. Signiﬁcant differences were observed for race/ 
ethnicity, c2 (3) ¼ 27.84, p < .0001, with the majority of 
African American teens in the unsure group and the majority 
of Hispanics in the not ready group; and household income, 
c2 (4) ¼ 10.78, p ¼ .029167, with the majority of those in the 
ready group having a household income over $30,000 per

year. Adolescents in the ready group also had more depres- 
sive symptoms, F (2, 173) ¼ 8.91, p ¼ .0002, and lower 
MHI-5 scores, F (2, 173) ¼ 6.47, p ¼ .0019. Given a hypo- 
thetical future need for care adolescents in the ready group 
were also more likely to report a preference for combined 
treatment (counseling and medication) than adolescents in 
the other groups; where as adolescents in the not-ready group 
reported a preference for counseling only or no treatment, 
c2 (4) ¼ 76.76, p < .0001. No signiﬁcant differences were 
observed by age, parent education, perceived severity, or 
utilization of care in the past 6 months. 
Relationship between readiness for treatment and future 
service use 
At the 6-month follow-up, 48.9% of the depressed adoles- 
cents reported receiving either counseling or an antidepres- 
sant since the baseline interview, with 14.7% of 
the 
depressed adolescents reported receiving both counseling 
and an antidepressant during that time (data not shown); 
however, only 29% were in treatment at the actual time of 
the follow up interview. To examine whether baseline readi- 
ness was a signiﬁcant predictor of service use at the follow- 
up interview, we employed an ordinal logistic regression 
model using the three-level measure of service use, where 
service use could have been new since baseline or continued 
since baseline (0 ¼ no treatment, 1 ¼ either counseling or 
antidepressants, and 2 ¼ combination of counseling and anti- 
depressants). Being in the ready group versus being ‘‘unsure’’ 
was a signiﬁcant predictor of service use at the 6-month 
follow-up, as was the average number of days impaired and 
overall mental health functioning (as measured by the 
MCS-12). Race/ethnicity was also a signiﬁcant predictor of 
service use at follow-up, with blacks and Hispanics having 
signiﬁcantly less service use than whites; gender and age 
were not signiﬁcant (see Table 4). Depressive symptoms at 
baseline were not related to service use at follow-up in the 
regression models that also controlled for demographic 
factors. The BIC for the ordinal logistic regression model 
was 393.79, which was smaller than that for the multinomial 
logistic regression (BIC ¼ 428.28), thus providing greater 
support in the data for modeling the outcome as ordinal. 
To examine what factors were signiﬁcant predictors of 
readiness, we employed a second ordinal logistic regression 
model using the three-level readiness measure deﬁned earlier 
(Table 5). The BIC for the ordinal logistic regression model 
was 406.64, which was smaller than that for the multinomial 
logistic regression (BIC ¼ 442.08), thus providing greater 
support in the data for modeling the outcome as ordinal. 
Race, gender, and age were not signiﬁcant predictors of read- 
iness. Average number of symptoms was signiﬁcantly asso- 
ciated with greater readiness; yet days impaired, mental 
health functioning, and perceived self-efﬁcacy were not asso- 
ciated with readiness. Parent acknowledgement of the teen 
having a problem with depression was signiﬁcantly associ- 
ated with greater teen readiness, although the parent’s 
previous service use at baseline was not a signiﬁcant 
predictor of treatment at 6-month follow-up.

Roughly half of the depressed adolescents received a tele- 
phone call about 2 months following their baseline interview 
to conﬁrm that the adolescent received the feedback letter and 
education materials. The counselor asked several questions 
about how the teen perceived the information and whether 
the adolescent was considering following up on the informa- 
tion. Although participation in this call had no impact on our 
results, the notes from these calls provide interesting insights. 
In general, adolescents were willing to discuss their thoughts 
about their depression and their thoughts on getting help. 
Counselors asked teens to rate their readiness to get help 
for depression on a ‘‘readiness ruler.’’ We found that the 
adolescents who were ready to change their depression 
(based on their self-report during the call) were more inter- 
ested in formal treatment options, whereas the adolescents 
who were not ready were most comfortable talking about 
informal or self-help options, such as learning more about 
depression or talking with a parent. Many of the adolescents 
who reported a high motivation to change intended to get 
help but also needed prompting: although many adolescents 
noted that they wanted to get help for their depression, they 
had not yet taken the steps needed. In these cases, it appeared

that the time with the counselor to go through the educational 
materials helped them to set a concrete goal for taking the 
next step. 

Although prior work on adults has shown that readiness to 
seek care is an important factor in seeking mental healthcare, 
there has been little work done related to teens. This work 
represents the ﬁrst step. Our results indicate that readiness 
is important, because it is related to the propensity to seek 
or continue care 6 months after detection of depression. 
Teen readiness for care at baseline increased the odds of 
getting care at 6 months, even after controlling for symptom 
severity. It should be noted that this care included psycho- 
therapy, medication, and combination treatment, with no 
judgment of what type of care might be most appropriate 
for teens with varying levels of symptoms. Recent studies 
on the treatment of teen depression show that combination 
treatment is most effective for teens with major depression 
[31], but there has been little information to date to guide 
treatment decision making for particular teens or for partic- 
ular severity levels. Our sample included teens with recent 
depression and lingering symptoms, as well as those with 
current depression, and thus all of them would be candidates 
for intervention of some type. Thus, our analysis only 
comments on the intensity of treatment, not on treatment 
type or appropriateness.

Our results revealed substantial variability among teen’s 
readiness for care at the baseline assessment. Adolescents 
with more severe depression were more ready to seek care, 
as were girls, white teens, and adolescents with a parent- 
reported household income above $30,000 per year. Thus, 
many teens may need help increasing readiness to seek care 
[32]. In particular, boys and those with milder depression 
may need special outreach. Teens’ readiness to seek care 
was also related to a higher preference for combined treat- 
ments, whereas those who were unsure said they would prefer 
counseling or watchful waiting. Thus, teens in the ready group 
were not only more ready to seek care, but they were also more 
open to seeking care with the best evidence-base at present. 
Parent acknowledgement of the teen’s depression had a strong 
impact on teen readiness independent of symptoms, suggest- 
ing that educational and motivational interventions may be 
needed to help teens and parents improve awareness that teens 
may be suffering from depression, to understand treatment 
options, and to seek care. Although a similar percentage of 
teens and parents preferred combination treatment, most 
parents preferred counseling alone, suggesting that evidence- 
based counseling needs to be more readily available to teens 
and parents. These ﬁndings highlight that in the primary care 
setting, detection of depression and feedback to parents, teens, 
and providers is only one part of the process in helping teens get 
treatment, given that many teens and parents are not ready to 
begin taking steps to obtain care. 

Efforts to enhance depression care for teens in primary 
care settings [3] show that modest uptake of services can 
improve teen outcomes. Because teens in primary care are 
not seeking mental health treatment, providers who detect 
depression in these settings should be mindful that adoles- 
cents may be at different stages of recognition and readiness 
for intervention. Although these teens have at least sought 
primary care, they may not have considered or be ready for 
mental health treatment. As such, screening or detection 
efforts should include questions about how the teen and 
parent perceive the problem, how severe they think it is, 
and whether they are considering care. These questions 
appear to be important in deciding which teens can get 
a referral with reasonable conﬁdence of follow-up, and which 
teens will need more discussion before receiving a referral. 
Providers might also inquire about what types of help appeal 
most to the adolescent and parent so that the education about 
options and the relative efﬁcacy of each can be delivered. 
Teens who are less ready may need follow-up visits or phone 
consultation to become more active in seeking care for them- 
selves. Lessons from substance abuse research, including 
ways to increase readiness or to move people from contem- 
plation to action, such as motivational interviewing, may 
apply to depressed teens in primary care settings [33,34]. 
This study demonstrated that readiness is associated with 
later treatment use and preferences among a group of teens 
seeking care in primary care ofﬁce setting; however, more 
work is needed to examine factors that inﬂuence readiness 
for depression treatment, particularly how parent and teen 
readiness interact and drive treatment decision making 
among noncare-seeking populations as well. More work is 
also needed to assess whether readiness for care can be 
enhanced through techniques such as motivational interview- 
ing or patient activation and empowerment. Alegria et al’s 
[35] ﬁndings suggest that such an approach can increase 
treatment attendance and retention in adults, but more 
research is needed to examine if these strategies will increase 
treatment uptake in adolescents.
