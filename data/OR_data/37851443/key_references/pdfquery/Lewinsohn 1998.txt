TREATMENT OF ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION: 
FREQUENCY OF SERVICES AND IMPACT ON 
FUNCTIONING IN YOUNG ADULTHOOD 

In this report, we (a) present descriptive information about the extent and the 
kinds of treatments being provided to depressed adolescents; (b) identify the 
factors that are related to treatment utilization; and (c) examine whether the 
provision of treatment during adolescence reduced the risk for the occurrence 
of depression during young adulthood (19–24 years). The sample consisted of 
1,507 randomly selected high school students who were diagnostically assessed 
on two occasions with an interval of approximately one year; 627 were assessed 
a third time when they reached the age of 24. The findings may be summa- 
rized as follows: 60.7% of those with major depressive disorder were provided 
with treatment. The modal treatment was outpatient, individual psycho- 
therapy administered by a mental health provider. Inpatient treatment and 
medications were rare. Factors found to be related to treatment utilization 
were the severity of the depression, the existence of a comorbid nonaffective 
disorder, the number of previous episodes of depression, history of suicide at- 
tempt, academic problems, lack of intact family, and female gender. Unexpect- 
edly, those who had received treatment were not less likely to relapse into 
another episode of depression during young adulthood. Depression and Anxi-

INTRODUCTION 
Knowledge regarding the degree to which treatment 
is provided to children and adolescents for depression 
is important for many reasons. For example, depres- 
sion is one of the most common psychiatric conditions 
of youth (Lewinsohn et al., 1993); it is associated with 
poor psychosocial functioning (Lewinsohn et al., 
1994), and adolescent depression is often recurrent, 
negatively impacting functioning in young adulthood 
(Fleming et al., 1993; Garber et al., 1988; Harrington 
et al., 1990; Kovacs, 1996). The first goal of the 
present study was to extend previous findings regard- 
ing treatment utilization for childhood and adoles- 
cent psychopathology (Cuffe et al., 1995; Offord et 
al., 1987) by ascertaining the extent of treatment 
and the kinds of treatments being provided to this 
age group. 
A second goal was to pinpoint factors related to 
treatment utilization. We hypothesized that adoles- 
cents with more severe depression, those with a 
comorbid nonaffective disorder, those with school 
problems, and those from disrupted families would be 
more likely to receive treatment. A third goal of the 
study was to examine whether there are any lasting 
positive effects of treatment during childhood and 


As per the literature, rates of treatment for adoles- 
cent depression in nonreferred community samples 
range from 15% to 65% (Beardslee et al., 1985; Cuffe 
et al., 1995; Goodman et al., 1997; Offord et al., 
1987). The most frequently used form of treatment 
for child/adolescent depression is outpatient psycho- 
therapy, with only a relatively small percentage of 
young patients receiving antidepressant medication 
(Kovacs et al., 1984; Keller et al., 1991). 
The availability of data from a longitudinal study of 
community individuals who were assessed at two points 
during adolescence and again in young adulthood pro- 
vided a unique opportunity to examine the impact of

treatment utilization on the probability of relapse in 
those who had recovered from their episode. In a previ- 
ous report of results from this sample (Lewinsohn et al., 
1995), we focused on the clinical consequences of 
comorbidity and reported the rate of treatment to be 
higher for comorbid disorders than for pure disorders, 
for female adolescents than for males, and for adoles- 
cents who did not live with both biological parents. 


Participants were adolescents who were randomly se- 
lected from nine senior high schools in western Oregon. 
A total of 1,709 adolescents completed the initial (T1) 
assessments (interview and questionnaires) between 1987 
and 1989, with an overall participation rate of 61% 
(additional details are provided in Lewinsohn et al., 
1993). At the second assessment (T2), 1,507 partici- 
pants (88.2%) returned for a readministration of the in- 
terview and questionnaire (mean T1-T2 interval = 13.8 
months, S.D. = 2.3). Differences between the sample and 
the larger population from which it was selected, and be- 
tween participants and those who declined to participate 
or dropped out of the study, were small. 
As participants reached their 24th birthday, subjects 
with a history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) 
and other psychopathology at T2 were invited to par- 
ticipate in a T3 telephone interview (Rohde et al., 
1997) as were an approximately equal number of ran- 
domly selected control subjects with no history of 
mental disorder at T2. Of the T3 assessments cur- 
rently in progress, 627 subjects had data available for 
the present study (T2 history of MDD, n = 220; T2 
history of nonaffective disorder, n = 162; T2 history of 
no disorder, n = 245). The mean follow-up interval 
between T2 and T3 was 6.1 years (S.D. = 1.0; range = 
3.0–8.7). 

Participants were interviewed at T1 with a version 
of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizo- 
phrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS), which 
combined features of the Epidemiologic version (K- 
SADS-E; Orvaschel et al., 1982) and the Present Epi- 
sode version (K-SADS-P), and included additional items 
to derive diagnoses of psychiatric disorders as per DSM- 
III-R criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 1987). 
At T2 and T3, subjects were interviewed using the Lon- 
gitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE; Shapiro 
and Keller, unpublished), which elicits detailed informa- 
tion about the course of psychiatric symptoms and disor- 
ders since the previous K-SADS interview. 

Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; 
Hamilton, 1960). As a measure of depressive epi- 
sode severity, a 14-item version of the HDRS was 
completed for current and worst past depressive 
symptoms. 
History of suicide attempt. As part of the inter- 
view assessments of depression, adolescents were 
asked: “Have you ever tried to kill yourself or done 
anything that could have killed you?” A history of a 
suicide attempt (presence or absence) by T2 was used. 
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 
Scale. (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). The 20-item CES- 
D was completed by subjects at T1 and T2. The 
highest CES-D total score from the T1 and T2 as- 
sessments was used in the present study. 
Academic problems. Nine items were combined 
into an aggregate measure of academic problems: life- 
time occurrence of school expulsion or suspension, tru- 
ancy, or repeating a grade; mean grade point average; 
low adolescent and parent satisfaction with grades; fre- 
quent school absenteeism, tardiness, and homework 
incompletion. Items were standardized and summed; the 
distribution was then dichotomized at one standard de- 
viation above the mean. 
Mental health treatment utilization. Information 
regarding lifetime outpatient, inpatient, and medica- 
tion treatment was collected at each assessment. If the 
participant had received outpatient treatment, type of 
treatment (individual, family, alcohol or drug treat- 
ment support groups, other group treatment), pro- 
vider (mental health professional, school counselor/ 
staff, clergy), length of treatment (1–2 sessions, 3–7 
sessions, 8–26 sessions, more than 26 sessions total), 
and age of first outpatient contact were ascertained. If 
the participant had received inpatient treatment, type 
(alcohol and drug treatment, psychiatric treatment), 
length (less than 1 month, 1 month or greater), age at 
first hospitalization, and number of hospitalizations 
were recorded. If psychoactive medication was pre- 
scribed, information was obtained regarding the type of 
medication (antidepressants, sedatives or minor tran- 
quilizers, stimulants, and “other”). 

Three depression groups were formed based on a 
combination of their diagnostic status up to T2 and 
their CES-D scores at T1 and T2: (1) MDD (n = 356) 
consisted of adolescents who met DSM-III-R criteria 
for major depressive disorder at or prior to T2; (2) 
Subsyndromal (n = 218) consisted of adolescents who 
scored at least one standard deviation above the 
sample mean on the CES-D (i.e., 27) at either T1 or 
T2 but did not meet diagnostic criteria for MDD; 
and (3) Never Depressed (n = 900) consisted of ado- 
lescents who scored less than 27 on both CES-D ad- 
ministrations and did not meet criteria for MDD at 
or before T2. 
Depression group membership was associated with 
several demographic factors and with nonaffective dis- 
order (for each contrast, rates are given for the MDD, 
Subsyndromal, and Never Depressed groups, respec- 
tively). Depression group was associated with gender 
(70.5%, 48.2%, and 48.2% female); c 2(2, n = 1,474) = 
53.96, P < .001; age (60.1%, 42.7%, and 46.1% were 


in the older half of the sample); c 2(2, n = 1,474) = 
24.10, P < .001; living situation (43.0%, 56.0%, 58.7% 
were living with both biological parents); c 2(2, n = 
1,474) = 25.56, P < .001; maximum parental education 
(40.4%, 45.0%, 50.3% had higher parental education); 
c 2(2, n = 1,474) = 10.01, P < .01; and the presence of a 
nonaffective disorder (47.8%, 34.4%, 19.7%); c 2(2, n 
= 1,474) = 102.66, P < .001. Depression group was not 
associated with race. 
RESULTS 
PROVISION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES 
TO DEPRESSED ADOLESCENTS 
Table 1 shows the lifetime treatment utilization in- 
formation for the total sample. A substantial propor- 
tion of adolescents received some form of mental 
health service, which virtually always consisted of out- 
patient treatment. Less than one in twelve of those re- 
ceiving outpatient treatment also received inpatient 
treatment, and approximately one-eighth of the ado- 
lescents receiving outpatient services also received 
medication. 
The rates of various mental health services for the 
Never Depressed, the Subsyndromal, and the MDD 
groups are also shown in Table 1. Overall group dif- 
ferences in treatment utilization were statistically sig- 
nificant for each of the three forms of mental health 
treatment (outpatient, medication, and inpatient). 
FACTORS RELATED TO TREATMENT 
UTILIZATION 
Mental health treatment utilization was associated 
with gender (46.1% of females vs. 32.2% of males re- 
ceived treatment) but not with age or parental educa- 
tion. The significant association between gender and 
treatment utilization was not due to the fact that 
females had a higher rate of MDD; controlling for de-

pression group membership, gender remained signifi- 
cantly associated with treatment utilization; likelihood 
ratio c 2 (1, n=1474) = 16.28, P < .001. 
The association between treatment and family 
structure was examined by classifying adolescents into 
four groups: adolescents living with a single mother, a 
single father, a biological parent and stepparent, and 
two biological parents. Treatment utilization rates sig- 
nificantly differed across the four groups; c 2 (3, n= 
1474) = 68.59, P < .001. Treatment rates were signifi- 
cantly greater for adolescents living with single mothers, 
single fathers, and stepfamilies (53.8%, 52.2%, and 
47.8%, respectively) compared to adolescents living in 
intact families (30.1%). Interactions with gender were 
nonsignificant. Differences in treatment utilization rates 
for the three depressiion groups remained significant af- 
ter controlling for relevant demographic factors and the 
co-occurrence of a non-affective disorder; utilization ra- 
tio c 2 (2, n= 1474) = 45.50, P < .001. 
The association of several factors with mental 
health treatment for adolescents with a history of 
MDD at T2 is shown in Table 2. Each of the variables 
was significantly associated with treatment utilization, 
as indicated by the unadjusted odds ratios (ORs). After 
adjusting for the impact of all the other variables using 
multiple logistic regression (MLR), treatment rates 
for depressed adolescents were significantly greater 
given psychiatric comorbidity, a history of suicide at- 
tempt, poor academic performance, female gender, 
and a nonintact family. The MLR correctly classified 
68.5% of the MDD adolescents (a comparable mul- 
tiple regression resulted in an R = .40, accounting for 
16.0% of the variance in treatment utilization). 
IMPACT OF ADOLESCENT TREATMENT ON 
OCCURRENCE OF DEPRESSION IN YOUNG 
ADULTHOOD 
Of the 627 subjects who have completed the T3 
interview to date, 228 (36.4%) reported experiencing 
an episode of MDD between T2 and T3 (this rate is 
not representative of the general community because 
participants with a previous disorder were over- 
sampled). As expected, T2 depression group mem- 
bership was highly associated with future MDD 
episodes; c 2(1, n = 627) = 35.52, P < .001. The inci- 
dence rates of MDD were 25.5%, 42.4%, and 50.0% 
in the Never Depressed, Subsyndromal, and MDD 
groups, respectively. 
Contrary to expectation, MDD incidence rate was 
higher for subjects who had received treatment (47.1% 
vs. 27.1%); c 2(1, n = 627) = 26.94, P < .001. Even when 
controlling for differences in T2 depression group sta- 
tus, gender, and the presence of nonaffective disorder 
during adolescent, the difference between treated and 
untreated groups remained significant. In an effort to 
clarify this counterintuitive finding, subsequent analy- 
ses were computed separately for the MDD and the 
subsyndromal depression groups. For subjects with a 
history of MDD at T2, a trend was present for those 
who had received treatment to have a higher rate of 
future MDD (54.6% vs. 41.8%); c 2(1, n = 220) = 3.34, 
P = .068. Because formerly depressed females were 
more likely to relapse ([55.2% vs. 34.5%]; c 2[1,n = 
220] = 7.01, P < .01), treatment utilization and future 
MDD were examined separately for females and males.

was unrelated to future depression relapse (56.8% re- 
lapse among treated females vs. 51.9% among non- 
treated); c 2(1, n = 165) = 0.35, P > .05. Among MDD 
male participants, previous treatment was associated 
with greater relapse (46.7% relapse among treated 
males vs. 20.0% among nontreated); c 2(1, n = 55) = 
4.29, P < .05. For subjects with subsyndromal depres- 
sion at T2, the provision of mental health treatment 
was unrelated to future occurrence of MDD, although 
the pattern was in a similar direction. Almost half of 
the T2 Subsyndromal adolescents who received treat- 
ment (48.8%) experienced their first episode of MDD 
by T3, compared with 36.6% of nontreated subsyn- 
dromal adolescents; c 2(1, n = 84) = 1.29, P > .05. 
In a final attempt to explain the counterintuitive 
findings, a series of analyses restricted to subjects who 
had received treatment during adolescence was per- 
formed. The rates of future depression were unre- 
lated to: (a) treatment provider (45.1% of adolescents 
treated by a mental health professional had a future 
MDD vs. 44.5% of those treated by others); c 2(1, n = 
271) = 0.01, P > .05; (b) treatment type (46.5% of 
adolescents receiving individual treatment had a fu- 
ture MDD vs. 37.9% receiving another modality); 
c 2(1, n = 271) = 1.35, P > .05; or (c) age of first outpa- 
tient treatment; likelihood ratio c 2 (1, n = 271) = 0.18, 
P > .05.. The rates of future depression were higher 
given a greater duration of previous treatment (52.4% 
of adolescents receiving 8 or more sessions had a fu- 
ture MDD vs. 38.0% of those receiving 1–7 sessions); 
c 2(1, n = 271) = 5.55, P < .05. 
DISCUSSION 
We found treatment utilization for depressed ado- 
lescents to be higher than has been reported in some 
previous studies (Goodman et al., 1997; Keller et al., 
1991; Offord et al., 1987) but comparable in magni- 
tude to the rates reported in a recent study by Cuffe et 
al. (1995). As expected, treatment utilization increased 
as a function of depression level. It is important to 
note that the treatment rate for the Subsyndromal 
group was significantly higher than that of the Never 
Depressed group. Subclinical or subthreshold depres- 
sion is being increasingly recognized as a significant 
clinical condition with associated psychosocial impair- 
ments. In interpreting the relatively high rate of treat- 
ment utilization for the Never Depressed group, it 
needs to be kept in mind that this group included ado- 
lescents with a history of nonaffective disorders. The 
modal treatment was individual outpatient psycho- 
therapy provided by mental health providers and 
slightly under half received 8 or more sessions of 
treatment. Inpatient treatment was relatively rare and 
typically was provided to those whose depression was 
comorbid with alcohol and drug abuse/dependence. 
In addition to depression severity, the presence of a 
comorbid nonaffective disorder, the number of MDD 
episodes, the history of a suicide attempt, the presence 
of academic problems, disruptive family structure, and 
being female were all positively related to treatment 
utilization. The odds ratios for all of these factors in- 
dicated that the variable generally doubled the likeli- 
hood of treatment. However, the variables, taken in 
combination, had limited predictive ability. Future 
studies need to identify other variables that were not 
included in our study which lead to mental health 
treatment utilization for depressed adolescents. 
Those who had received treatment were not less 
likely to experience a new episode of depression dur- 
ing young adulthood. Actually, the trend was in the 
opposite direction, and formerly depressed boys who 
had received treatment were more likely to have re- 
lapsed. Our attempts to account for this finding in 
terms of initial severity differences between those who 
received and those who did not receive treatment were 
not borne out. Existing treatment outcome studies have 
generally focused on the short-term effects of treatment 
(Kazdin, 1993). To our knowledge this is the only study 
that has examined the long-term effects of outpatient 
treatment in a community sample. Clearly, the finding of 
negative relationship between treatment and prognosis is 
provocative and needs to be cross-validated. While re- 
lapse is only one criterion of long-term treatment effi- 
cacy, it is clearly a very important one. 
Two possible explanations can be offered for this 
counterintuitive finding. First, other factors (which 
were not measured in the present study) which have 
negative prognostic implications may be correlated 
with being referred for treatment. For example, boys 
who were living in especially stressful environments 
may have been selected for treatment but living in the 
same bad environment might have undone the initial 
benefits derived from treatment. Another possibility is 
that the effects of treatment do not extend into the 
future far enough to prevent relapse. The question 
that is being raised by our findings is: Are there any 
lasting beneficial effects from treatments? This needs 
to be addressed by future research. 
Limitations of our study include the fact that we did 
not have a measure of treatment “adequacy.” Some 
(Keller et al., 1991) have suggested that depressed 
children often receive inadequate services. Admittedly, 
“adequacy” of treatment, either as per clinical judge- 
ment or as per empirical studies, is a difficult con- 
struct to measure, but clearly psychotherapy covers a 
multitude of interventions and some of these are 
probably better than others. Another limitation of our 
study is that our measure of treatment utilization is 
entirely based on self-report by the adolescent. 
While there is no a priori reason to question the 
veridicality of these self-reports, independent cor- 
roboration would have been desirable. 
A number of the findings which are being reported 
for the first time in this paper will be addressed in fu- 
ture publications, such as the very high rate of relapse 
among those who had an episode of MDD during 
adolescence, and the fact that the MDD incidence rate 


was also high among those with subthreshold depres- 
sion in adolescence.
