This study examines longitudinal mental health service use patterns of a school-based sample of 
adolescents. Based on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale scores, a stratified 
sample of middle-school students was interviewed using the Schedule f o r Affective Disorders and 
Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children: cycle one (n = 579; mean age 12.83) and cycle two (n = 
490; mean age 18.65). Service use also was assessed by mailed questionnaire: cycle three (n = 330; 
mean age 20.60). Service use decreased over time. Whites and males received significantly mare 
treatment in the first cycle. In the second cycle, service use by race and gender was equal; in the third 
cycle, females received more treatment. Those with a psychiatric diagnosis (first cycle, 54%; second 
cycle, 33%) received treatment in the prior year. Under-treatment of youth with psychiatric 
diagnoses is a significant problem, with differences in service use by race and gender over time.

There is a paucity of research on mental health service use in community samples of adolescents, 
and even fewer studies examining service use longitudinally. The majority of studies to date have 
shown that less than half of children with psychiatric disorders have contact with any professional 
for their emotional or behavioral problems. 1-5 The percentage of children with disorders reporting 
treatment contact with any professional ranges from 18% to 45% in these studies. They included 
teachers, family physicians, guidance counselors, clergy, and other professionals as long as the focus 
was on emotional problems. Three other studies 6-8 found slightly over half of the children (range, 
51% to 58%) with emotional problems saw any professional for these problems. With the exception 
of the study by Leaf et al 5 in 1996, which found only 36% of the children with problems received any 
he!p, the more recent studies have shown a higher percentage of children with disorders receiving 
some contact with a professional. This may be seen as a promising sign that more children are 
receiving some treatment. However, it appears only a small minority of these children are receiving 
specialty mental health care. In the two s t u d i e s 6'7 providing a breakdown by professional groups, only 
33% and 11%, respectively, of the disordered children received treatment from a trained mental 
health professional. 
Few studies have examined the reasons why some children are treated while others are not. The 
existing evidence is contradictory. Cohen and Hesselbart 9 found that the only diagnoses correlated 
with service use were conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder. Cuffe et al 8 found all 
diagnoses significantly associated. Some studies m~ have shown a predominance of boys in 
treatment in childhood and girls in adolescence. Others have found no differences by sex 2,4 or males 
treated more than females in early adolescence) Similarly, Offord et al4 found no differences by age, 
Socioeconomic status (SES), or urbanicity, while Cohen and Hesselbart 9 found lower treatment 
levels in 18- to 21-year-olds, rural residents, and middle-income families. Finally, Cuffe et al8 and 
Hoberman ~z found evidence of under-treatment for African Americans, while other studies report the 
possibility of higher service use in this group. 9Aa't4 Some variation may be due to regional differences 
in help-seeking behaviors since these studies were conducted in different regions of the United 
States. 
Most studies have used cross-sectional data. Research using longitudinal, community-based 
designs could begin to clarify some of the inconsistencies in the literature. Accordingly, we report 
on mental health service use data from a longitudinal, school-based, epidemiologic study of 
adolescents, The relationship between race, sex, psychiatric diagnosis, socioeconomic status, and 
service use is explored. 


The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) ~5 is a 20-item, self-report, 
symptom rating scale developed to measure depressive symptomatology. When completing the 
instrument, the individual is asked to report on his or her feelings during the preceding week. The 
total CES-D score (range, 0 to 60) is obtained by summing the 20 depression items. The single score 
is used to index the degree of depressive symptomatology present. Three suicide items ("I felt life 
was not worth living," "I felt like hurting myself," and "I felt like killing myself") were added to the 
end of the CES-D. Responses to these additional items were made on the same scale as the original 
20 CES-D items. 
The Present Episode Version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for 
School-Aged Children (K-SADS) ~6 is a semi-structured diagnostic interview. The K-SADS focuses 
on psychiatric disorders during the past year in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Items 
covered in the K-SADS permit the measurement of affective, schizophrenic, anxiety, phobic, 
conduct, substance use/abuse, and eating disorder symptoms and diagnoses. Information regarding 



specific types (thoughts versus plans versus actions), onset, frequency, severity (intent), and medical 
lethality of suicidal behaviors as well as non-suicidal physically self-damaging acts is also collected. 
K-SADS data were entered into a computer program, and cut-off points were set for the severity of 
response needed to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition 17 
(DSM-IV) symptom criteria. A computer algorithm was created corresponding to DSM-IV diagnos- 
tic criteria to determine final diagnoses. 
Inpatient and outpatient treatments were assessed using the K-SADS by way of two overall 
screening items. For inpatient hospitalizations, participants were asked about psychiatric hospital- 
ization during the present episode or last year, not including direct transfer from another hospital. The 
item for inpatient treatment was measured on a 0 to 2 scale (0 = No information; 1 = No; 2 = Yes). 
For outpatient treatment they were asked, "Did you see any professional person where the focus was on 
your emotional or behavioral problems ?" The item for outpatient treatment was measured on a 0 to 3 scale 
(0 = No information; 1 = No contact; 2 = Consultation for no more than 2 weeks of treatment; 3 = More 
than 2 weeks of treatment). After examining the data, it was seen that too few subjects received inpatient 
treatment (n = 16 at baseline and 7 at follow-up) to analyze this group separately. All hospitalized subjects 
also reported outpatient treatment. Thus, psychiatric treatment was defined as indicating any treatment 
on the outpatient treatment item (answering with value 2 or 3). 
The Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) 18 was used to assess impairment in family, 
social, peer, and school functioning on a scale of 0 to 100. Those subjects with a CGAS score of 60 
or less were judged to have met the criterion for impairment in functioning. 

This study is part of a longitudinal study of depression and suicidal behaviors in adolescents. Data 
were collected in three cycles: 1987 through 1989 for the first cycle, 1991 through 1994 for the second 
cycle, and 1994 through 1995 for the third cycle. Data for the first cycle (1987 through 1989) were 
collected on 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th grade students in six public suburban schools (four middle schools 
and two high schools) in a single school district in the Southeast. The general methods of the first 
cycle of the study are described elsewhere. 19 Data collection in the first cycle occurred in two phases: 
school screening and diagnostic evaluation. Each year during the school screening, students enrolled 
in the participating schools were contacted in classroom settings. Ninety-eight percent (n = 3,456) 
of the students completed a self-administered questionnaire that included the CES-D (to which three 
suicide items were added) and demographic variables. 
The diagnostic evaluation in the first cycle consisted of separate semi-structured interviews of the 
adolescent and one parent (most often the mother). The interview protocol utilized the K-SADS, the 
CGAS, and the Hollingshead two-factor index of social position? Â° The following types of students 
were asked to participate in the interview phase of the study: (1) students with the highest CES-D 
scores (ie, scores > 30, top 10 percent; n = 220); (2) students with high suicide screening scores 
(scores _> 6; n = 40); (3) students with probable depression derived by applying an algorithm based 
on research diagnostic criteria 21 to the CES-D responses (n = 40); (4) students with a missing CES- 
D score (n = 20); (5) low-risk black students also were oversampled (n = 79) to ensure the ability to 
analyze the data by race; and (6) a random sample of the remaining low-risk white students (n = 180). 
For reporting purposes the four high-risk categories are combined into one high-risk group and the 
number of low-risk black and white students are reported. Psychiatric nurse clinicians who had 
participated in a rigorous 3-month training and standardization period conducted all interviews 
during the first cycle. 
Those students interviewed at any time during the first cycle were recruited for follow-up 
interviews in consecutive years during the first cycle. The total number of individuals completing a 
diagnostic evaluation in the first cycle was 589. Eight adolescents reporting their race as other than 
black or white were excluded from analyses due to small numbers. Two participants were excluded 



due to missing information on the outcome variable, leaving a total of 579 students in these analyses. 
This sample includes 320 high-risk students, 79 low-risk black students, and 180 low-risk white 
students. This number represents an increase of 101 youth from an earlier study 8 that reported on the 
cross-sectional service use patterns of adolescents during the first cycle of this project and included 
only those subjects completing diagnostic interviews in the year following their first school 
screening. The 21% increase in subjects allows a larger sample of adolescents to be followed 
longitudinally for service use patterns. 
Data collection during the second cycle consisted of a semi-structured interview of the adolescent 
and a parent (usually the mother) during the 12th grade. If the adolescent was married, the spouse 
was interviewed rather than a parent. The interview protocol utilized the K-SADS, the CGAS, and 
an adolescent written questionnaire. The adolescent written questionnaire included the CES-D scale 
and demographic information including race and sex. A total of 490 individuals completed the 
second cycle diagnostic evaluation and written questionnaire, but only 488 provided treatment 
information. This sample includes 266 high-risk students, 63 low-risk black students, and 159 low- 
risk white students. 
Psychiatry residents and fellows and master's-prepared psychologists in a doctorate program 
conducted the interviews during the second cycle. All interviewers participated in rigorous training 
and standardization procedures. 
For the third cycle of data collection a mental health treatment questionnaire was mailed to all 
individuals who participated in the second cycle of diagnostic interviews. This questionnaire was 
mailed in 1994 through 1995 and was used to determine whether the individual had any lifetime or 
past-year mental health treatment. Three-hundred and thirty individuals completed and returned the 
mailed questionnaire. This represents 172 high-risk students, 38 low-risk black students, and 120 
low-risk white students. 

All statistical analyses incorporated a stratified two-stage sampling design. Weights were 
calculated by dividing the number of individuals in each stratum in the baseline screening sample by 
the number of individuals in the corresponding stratum in the baseline clinical sample for individuals 
in the first cycle. For individuals in the second cycle, the baseline screening sample was divided by 
the number of individuals in the corresponding stratum in the follow-up clinical sample. Appropriate 
weights were applied to each observation. SUDAAN 22 was used to incorporate the stratified two- 
stage sampling design into all statistical analyses. 
Weighted percentages and prevalence estimates were calculated on the demographic character- 
istics, treatment utilization, and psychiatric disorders. Demographic variables included race (black 
and white; white is the referent group), gender (male is the referent group), and SES (categorized as 
low versus medium to high; medium to high is the referent group). Psychiatric disorders include 
major depressive disorder (MDD), any disorder, and a four-category psychiatric disorder variable 
(affective comorbid with nonaffective disorder, affective disorder only, nonaffective disorder only, 
and no disorder; no disorder is the referent group). Weighted percentages of treatment were 
calculated by race and gender groups within the four psychiatric disorder categories and among those 
with any psychiatric disorder for those in the first and second cycles of diagnostic evaluation. 
Weighted logistic regression was utilized to determine the correlates of outpatient treatment among 
those in the first and second cycles of diagnostic evaluation. Possible correlates included race-gender 
groups, SES, total CES-D score, and the four psychiatric disorder categories. All variables were first 
entered into univariable weighted logistic regression models. Those variables statistically significant at 
an alpha level of 0.05 were then entered into a comprehensive multivariable weighted logistic regression 
model. Using a backward stepwise elimination procedure, the final multivariable weighted logistic 
regression model contained all variables retaining significance at an alpha level of 0.05. 



Weighted chi-square tests were performed to determine differences in treatment utilization by race 
and by gender using data from the mailed questionnaire. Differences in treatment in the past year and 
before the past year were assessed. 

Overall frequencies and weighted percentages are given in Table 1 for demographic, treatment, 
and psychiatric variables in each of the three samples, first cycle of diagnostic evaluation, second 
cycle of diagnostic evaluation, and the mailed service utilization questionnaire (third cycle). 
Distributions of race and gender are consistent across the three samples with approximately 83% to 
86% white and 53% to 56% female. The percentage of individuals in the low SES group decreased 
over the course of the study (32% in the first cycle, 30% in the second cycle, 25% in the third cycle). 
The percentage of individuals receiving mental health treatment in the past year also showed a 
decrease over time (24% of the first cycle, 9% of the second cycle, and 3% of the third cycle). 
Weighted prevalence of disorder during the first cycle was higher than at the second cycle for MDD, 
any disorder, and all diagnosis categories. 
Table 2 shows weighted prevalence of mental health treatment by race-gender groups within 
disorder categories for the first cycle diagnostic evaluation and the second cycle diagnostic 
evaluation. Rates of treatment were lower at the second cycle diagnostic evaluation for all race- 
gender groups within all diagnosis categories with the exception of black males with nonaffective 
disorder only and any disorder and white males with affective disorder comorbid with a nonaffective 
disorder. However, these rates are based on a very small sample of black males in both the first and

second cycle diagnostic evaluations and should be interpreted with caution. In addition, rates of 
treatment are highest for individuals with an affective disorder comorbid with a nonaffective 
disorder, followed by an affective disorder only, then a nonaffective disorder only, and finally no 
disorder. For those with any disorder, 54% received treatment in first cycle, while 33% were treated 
in cycle two. Further, a history of diagnosis and treatment during the first cycle was not associated 
with having a diagnosis in the second cycle. For example, of those students with an affective disorder 
only in the first cycle, 2 of 13 who received treatment retained a diagnosis at the second cycle, while 
1 of 13 who did not receive treatment retained a diagnosis. This pattern is similar for all diagnostic 
categories. 
As would be expected, the high-risk students had higher levels of both diagnoses (153 of 320; 
47.8%) and treatment (102 of 320; 31.9%) than did the low-risk white (40 of 180 or 22.2% with 
diagnosis; 38 of 180 or 21.1% treated) or black (19 of 79 or 24.1% with diagnosis; 9 of 79 or 11.4% 
treated) students at baseline. The follow-up data are similar, with 15% of high-risk students (40 of 
267), 4.6% of low-risk white students (7 of 153) and 3.2% of low-risk black students (2 of 63) 



receiving a diagnosis, while 13.5% (36) high-risk students, 7.5% (12) low-risk white, and 6.3% (4) 
low-risk black students received treatment. 
Weighted univariable and multivariable models for outpatient treatment in the first and second 
cycles of diagnostic evaluation are given in Table 3. The final multivariable model consisted of race- 
gender groups, CES-D total score, and the disorder categories. At the first cycle black females (odds 
ratio [OR] = 0.35) andblack males (OR = 0.39) were significantly less likely to receive treatment than 
white males. White females (OR = 0.68) also were less likely to have outpatient treatment at the first 
cycle, although the difference was not significant. Those with higher CES-D scores were more likely 
(OR = 1.05) to have had outpatient treatment at the first cycle. An increasing trend was seen in the 
disorder categories at first cycle with those having an affective disorder comorbid with a nonaffective 
disorder being more likely to have had outpatient treatment (OR = 12.34), followed by affective 
disorder only (OR = 10.55), and finally nonaffective disorder only (OR = 5.35). Associations were 
similar, with the exception of race-gender groups, at the second cycle diagnostic evaluation, although 
the magnitudes of the odds ratios were less. Black females (OR = 0.87) were less likely and black 
males (OR = 1.31) and white females (OR = 1.54) were more likely to have had outpatient treatment 
at the second cycle, but these associations were not statistically significant.

Using data from the third cycle survey of service utilization, significant chi-square statistics (Table 
4) were seen for race with treatment before the past year (p = .0006) and for gender with treatment 
in the past year (p = .0061). Whites (21%) were more likely to have received treatment before the 
past year than blacks (6%). Likewise, females (5%) were more likely to have received treatment in 
the past year than males (1%). These results should be viewed with caution due to small numbers, 
Since no diagnostic evaluation was performed at the time of the third cycle mailed survey, logistic 
regression analysis for diagnostic variables could not be performed. However, using diagnosis at 
cycle two as a proxy for diagnostic status, 24% of those with major depression and 20% of those with 
any disorder received treatment in the past year. 

The results of this study add to our knowledge of the patterns of adolescent mental health service 
use. In early adolescence, boys predominated and a majority (54%) of subjects diagnosed with 
psychiatric disorders had some contact with a professional where the focus was on emotional 
problems. As these youth progressed through adolescence, however, there was a dramatic decrease 
in such treatment. In the second cycle, only 33% of those receiving a diagnosis reported any 
treatment. In the third cycle in late adolescence, only 20% of those receiving a diagnosis in the second 
cycle received treatment. These data mirror the service use of the overall sample for the three time 
periods of 24% for the first cycle, 9% for the second, and 3% for the third. 
Selective attrition could account for part of the decrease in treatment contact for the sample over 
time. The three samples differed by race (statistically significant) and SES (not statistically 
significant). Adolescents diagnosed with a disorder in the first cycle were lost to follow-up more than 
adolescents without a disorder, but the difference was not statistically significant. For example, 16% 
of students with major depressive disorder and 13% of those with no diagnosis were lost to follow- 
up (p = .38). Thus, having a diagnosis during the first cycle did not correlate with an increased 
attrition. Approximately 57% of the total sample, and 66% of the students from cycle two, responded 
to the mailed questionnaire. This sample had a lower number in the low socioeconomic group and 
a much lower number of black males. This could introduce bias and result in an underestimate of

service use for the sample as a whole. However, the treatment patterns of the subgroup of 330 subjects 
completing the mailed survey were computed separately. The percentage of this sample receiving 
treatment during the three time periods is virtually identical to the results for the entire sample. This 
reduces the likelihood that selective attrition played a major role in these results. 
The dramatic decrease in the frequency of contact with professionals as the adolescents grow older 
may reflect multiple factors related to help-seeking behaviors. First, the older adolescent tends to be 
less under parental influence and therefore more able to resist seeking help. Second, the majority of 
mental health-related services are obtained in the school setting. 5'7 As adolescents age, more tend to 
drop out of school. It is probable that children with psychiatric disorders have higher drop-out rates, 
thus reducing their access to care in this setting. Finally, the transition from high school to college 
or work may disrupt treatment for the adolescent and young adult, or reduce the likelihood of 
pursuing treatment. Economic barriers in particular may become prominent. These data support 
Cohen and Hesselbart's 9 findings of very low service use in this age group. Further study of the 
relevant causes is important. This is a time when psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, major 
depression, and schizophrenia may be expressed. The stress of transition to adulthood also may 
increase vulnerability to psychiatric morbidity. There are serious implications for secondary and 
tertiary prevention of psychiatric illness. If the underlying reasons for the decrease in service use were 
understood, interventions could be devised to increase treatment in this age group. 
The relationship of service use to gender is interesting in this sample. In the early adolescent period 
males received treatment at a slightly, but not significantly, higher rate. In later adolescence (second 
cycle), the frequency of treatment contact is approximately equal between the sexes. Females were 
significantly more likely to obtain treatment in the early adult period (third cycle mailed survey) for 
this sample, where service use resembles the reported service use frequency of adult samples. Self- 
selection bias (who returned the survey) could account for some of the difference in service use. 
Unlike the Cohen and Hesselbart 9 study, the current study shows affective disorders significantly 
correlated with service use in both early and late adolescence. Nonaffective disorder diagnoses were 
significantly correlated with service use in early, but not late, adolescence, and the magnitude of the 
odds ratios was the smallest of any diagnostic category. As might be expected, the comorbid 
occurrence of affective and nonaffective disorders was associated with the highest odds ratios. 
Race was significantly correlated with service use in both simple and multivariable models in the 
youngest age group. These data cannot shed light on the cause of this finding. Cultural factors appear 
to be impacting the use of mental health services by young teens. The differences in treatment contact 
by race lessened over time, until they were virtually identical in early adulthood. Further study of 
differences in help-seeking behaviors and service use patterns by race is warranted. 
The number of adolescents diagnosed with psychiatric disorders decreased over time in this 
sample. This is counter-intuitive since research has pointed to increased risk for developing 
psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder in late adolescence and 
early adulthood. The reduced numbers of diagnosed subjects in the older age groups limit the ability 
to analyze by race, gender, and SES. A possible explanation of this decrease is that the first cycle 
diagnoses relied heavily on the parent' s report of symptoms in reaching a diagnosis. In 7th, 8th, and 
9th grade the parent (usually the mother) felt very comfortable reporting symptoms for their children. 
In the second cycle, however, the interviewers noticed that many parents had very little knowledge 
of their adolescent's symptoms, particularly internalizing symptoms. This may have decreased the 
ability to reach a threshold for diagnoses in the second cycle. In addition, older adolescents may be 
more likely to deny or disavow emotional or behavioral problems. 
This phenomenon of decreasing diagnoses in older adolescents has been previously reported in a 
cross-sectional study of a large general population of children and adolescents. 23 In Cohen et al' s 
study, many diagnoses showed a sharp decline in prevalence in the older groups of children. The 
current study supports the Cohen et al study findings with a longitudinal sample and suggests that 
their results are not due solely to a cohort effect. 



These data are limited in their ability to shed light on the motivations for or barriers to mental health 
care in this sample of adolescents and their families. There are no data concerning the type of 
professional consulted, the type of treatment, or the perceived outcome of the treatment. There is a 
need for increased research focused on service use patterns, accessibility of care, and perceived 
barriers to mental health care. Factors related to help-seeking behaviors by parents, adolescents, and 
young adults are particularly important to understand. Epidemiologic and services research have 
shown both the prevalence of disorders and the amount of unmet service need. Further work should 
detail the barriers to treatment that underlie the failure to seek treatment by parents and teenagers. 

Many questions also are posed for clinicians and mental health care managers by these data. 
Under-use of services by adolescents with disorders may reduce the immediate costs to managed 
health care companies. However, the long-term functioning of these individuals may be poor, 
resulting in far greater human costs and costs to employers over time. There is growing evidence that 
while people with mental disorders often have a higher use of other medical services, once some 
mental health treatment is obtained there may be a reduction in overall health service costs. ~ This 
cost offset is especially important in view of the current national debate over nondiscriminatory 
mental health coverage (parity) by the insurance and managed care industries. Further data are 
needed to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and overall service use costs. 
Information from epidemiologic and service use studies should be used to design intervention 
strategies across the continuum of the mental health prevention/treatment spectrum. 25~26 This 
includes research on risk factors and causality used for universal, selective, and indicated prevention 
studies and research to prevent comorbidity, disability, and relapse in a clinical population. 
Interventions seeking to reduce the rate of treatment drop-out rates would be particularly important 
in the late adolescent and young adult periods.
