The study of affective disorders in adolescence is of criti- 
cal psychiatric importance. In adolescents, major depres- 
sion and dysthymic disorder are frequent, recurrent, and 
often familial disorders that tend to continue into adult- 
hood. They are frequently associated with other psychiat-

ric conditions, poor psychosocial and academic outcome, 
and increased risk of substance abuse, bipolar disorder, 
and suicide (for review, see Birmaher et al., 1996). 
Population studies of adolescents have reported lifetime 
prevalence of major depression ranging from 0.4% to 
8.3% (Birmaher et al., 1996; Garrison et al., 1997) and 
point prevalence of dysthymic disorder from 1.6% to 8% 
(Garrison et al., 1997; Kashani et al., 1987; Lewinsohn 
et al., 1994). In adolescents, the female-male ratio for 
affective disorders is approximately 2:1, paralleling the 
ratio reported in adults (Fleming and Offord, 1990; 
Lewinsohn et al., 1994). The majority of youths with 
clinical depression are not seen by health professionals 
(Burns, 1991; Costello et al., 1993). Research suggests 
that prevention of adolescent affective disorders is pos- 
sible when populations at elevated risk are targeted for 
psychosocial interventions: promising results have been 
obtained in programs developed for children of depressed 


parents (Beardslee et al., 1992) and for adolescents with 
subclinical depressive symptomatology (Clarke et al., 
1995). Numerous factors are associated with the onset, 
duration, and recurrence of juvenile depression, includ- 
ing demographic factors, phenomenology of symptoms, 
comorbid conditions, family factors, psychosocial factors, 
and stressful life events (for review, see Birmaher et al., 
1996; Hoberman et al., 1996; Moreau, 1996). The links 
between adolescent depression and substance use have 
been emphasized by several authors (Desimone et al., 1994; 
Rao et al., 2000; Whitmore et al., 1997). Most of these 
ﬁndings are from studies conducted in U.S. sites and in 
populations under treatment for major depression (Roberts 
et al., 1995). It is therefore important to examine the 
phenomenology and psychosocial correlates of major 
depression and dysthymia in adolescents from the commu- 
nity in non-U.S. sites. In particular, it is worth exploring 
the crucial question as to whether the rate of identiﬁca- 
tion and treatment of affective disorders in adolescents is 
higher in European countries that have free access to psy- 
chiatric care. We describe results from an epidemiological 
study conducted in secondary schools of a geographical dis- 
trict in France. The aims of the study were to compare the 
phenomenology and psychosocial correlates of DSM- 
III-R major depression and dysthymia among adolescents 
diagnosed as cases in a community-based study. We focused 
particularly on associated diagnostic and behavioral fea- 
tures, environmental factors, psychosocial impairment, 
and treatment seeking, according to diagnostic subgroups. 

The study followed a two-stage design: a self-report questionnaire was 
ﬁrst administered to a large, unselected school population; then, after 
subjects were designated into subgroups (based on responses to the 
initial questionnaire), individual clinical interviews were conducted. The 
entire procedure took place during two academic years (1988–1990). 

Under the George Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe, the 
INSERM (U 472) conducted an epidemiological survey of a repre- 
sentative sample of school attendees (Ledoux et al., 1991). All students 
(N = 3,527) from 153 classes that were randomly selected in the junior 
high schools, high schools, and vocational schools of the Chaumont 
and Langres districts in the department of Haute-Marne in France 
were asked to participate in the study. Each student ﬁlled out a self- 
report questionnaire, including 280 multiple-choice questions on 
demographic and social status, education, somatic and mental health 
symptoms (emotional and behavioral problems, suicidal thoughts, eat- 
ing and sleep problems), substance use (tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs), 
aspects of daily life (leisure, sexual relationships), help-seeking behav- 
ior, prescriptions of psychotropic drugs, life events, and quality of 

family relationships (for details, see Gasquet et al., 1997). Depressive 
symptoms were assessed on the Kandel Depressive Mood Inventory 
(Kandel and Davies, 1982), translated and validated in French 
(Gasquet, 1996). In the selected classes, 3,311 students aged 11 to 20 
years (i.e., 93.9% of the total population) participated in the survey. 
The reason for nonparticipation was either refusal by the student or his 
family or absence from school the day the study took place. The stu- 
dents ﬁlled out the questionnaire during a regular classroom period 
under the supervision of a school nurse. Completion time was 1 to 2 
hours, depending on the student’s academic level. Anonymous ques- 
tionnaires were sealed and sent to the INSERM (U 472). Data from 
sociodemographic questions (sex, date, and place of birth) were kept 
on a nominative list by the school nurses and used to select subjects for 
stage II interviews. A total of 3,287 questionnaires (93.2% of targeted 
population) were considered valid for analysis. 

Based on answers to the self-report questionnaire, three groups of 
subjects were selected for stage II clinical examination. Group 1 (n = 
59) consisted of students with eating disorder symptoms. Group 2 (n = 
62) included students with total score of 17 or 18 (maximum score = 
18) on the Kandel Depressive Mood Inventory and those hospitalized 
for suicide attempt during the previous 12 months. Group 3 (n = 121) 
was a control group, randomly selected from students who did not ful- 
ﬁll criteria for either group 1 or group 2 but were matched to each sub- 
ject from both groups for age, sex, and school level. For logistic and 
ﬁnancial reasons, we chose not to interview students enrolled in rural 
schools (which were too far from the two main towns of the district) 
and students in the ﬁnal grade of schooling at stage I (grade 9 in junior 
high school, grade 12 in high school or vocational school), who had left 
school by the time stage II was undertaken. 
Semistructured clinical interviews (lasting 1–11⁄2 hours) were con- 
ducted at school by seven psychiatrists and one clinical psychologist, 
with French versions of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and 
Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Epidemiologic version (K- 
SADS-E) (Chambers et al., 1985), the Children’s Global Assessment 
Scale (CGAS) (Shaffer et al., 1983), and sections developed by the 
investigators on psychosocial adaptation, puberty, and treatment 
seeking. All clinicians had been trained to use these instruments and 
were blind to students’ screening status. Interrater reliability for 
DSM-III-R diagnoses, assessed by exchanging records between pairs 
of clinicians, was satisfactory (κ = 0.73 for major depression and 0.76 
for dysthymia). In addition, each student completed a brief self- 
report questionnaire with information regarding school, health, sub- 
stance use, and a list of life events during the prior 12 months. 
Among subjects selected for clinical evaluation, 76%, 87%, and 
91% could be interviewed for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (partici- 
pation rates not statistically different between groups). Nonpartic- 
ipants included 15 students who had left school, 4 who refused the 
interview, and 14 who were sick or absent for other reasons for at least 
two consecutive appointments. Absenteeism did not differ between 
groups, and responses on various items of the initial questionnaire (on 
school, somatic problems, conduct problems, family relationships, 
etc.) did not differentiate subjects who were interviewed from those 
who were not. 
From the 209 adolescents interviewed, 205 (84.7% of subjects eli- 
gible for stage II) provided valid data. According to lifetime diagnosis 
of mood disorder, three groups were considered: subjects with major 
depression (n = 49), subjects with dysthymia and without major 
depression (n = 21), and subjects with no mood disorder (n = 135). 
Results on subjects with eating disorders have been published else- 
where (Flament et al., 1995). 




A priori hypotheses were the following: (1) phenomenology of 
symptoms and comorbidity differ between major depression and dys- 
thymia; (2) both disorders have similar morbidity; and (3) treatment 
seeking is low for both. 
Subjects with major depression, dysthymia, or no mood disorder 
were compared with the SAS package. Depending on the type of var- 
iable examined, we considered either groups with lifetime diagnoses 
(e.g., for phenomenology, comorbidity) or groups with current diag- 
noses (e.g., for CGAS, events within the past 12 months). Qualitative 
variables were compared with the χ2 test, with and without the Yates 
corrections, or Fisher exact test, as required by the size of expected fre- 
quencies. For quantitative data, intergroup comparisons were per- 
formed with the Student t test. Since the three groups did not differ in 
age, sex, and socioeconomic status (Table 1), those variables were not 
entered in the analyses. For variables in which one or both depressed 
groups differed from controls, we looked within the depressed groups 
(one or both groups combined, as appropriate) for the effects of single 
versus multiple episodes, duration of the disorder, double depression, 
and comorbidity. 




Respondents were aged 13 to 21 years, and more than 
95% had started puberty; 70% lived with both natural 
parents. There was an overrepresentation of girls (female-

male ratio = 4:1) because of sampling design. Table 1 
shows sociodemographic characteristics of subjects with 
lifetime diagnosis of depression or no mood disorder. 
Eleven subjects (16% of those with mood disorder) had 
double depression, as defined by Keller and Shapiro 
(1982); they were included in the major depression 
group. Fourteen subjects (29%) in the major depression 
group had had more than one lifetime major depressive 
episode (12 [25%] had had two; 2 [4%] had had three). 

Mean ages at onset of major depression (mean ± SD = 
14.8 ± 2.4 years) and dysthymia (13.8 ± 3.1 years) were 
similar (t = 1.29, p = .1). Mean duration of current major 
depressive episode was 5.9 months (range, 3 weeks to 21 
months), and mean duration of current dysthymia was 
close to 3 years (range, 1–10 years) (t = 6.07, p = .006). 
The frequency of all depressive symptoms was higher 
(p < .01) in subjects with lifetime diagnoses of either 
major depression or dysthymia than in controls (e.g., 
depressed mood: 96% in major depression, 100% in dys- 
thymia, 43% in controls; loss of weight/appetite: 37%, 
19%, 9%, respectively; increase in weight/appetite: 37%, 
38%, 19%; insomnia: 90%, 67%, 15%; anhedonia: 90%, 
76%, 27%; lack of energy: 90%, 62%, 24%; feelings of 
worthlessness: 78%, 57%, 18%; social withdrawal: 71%, 
62%, 17%; suicidal thoughts: 45%, 43%, 13%). Subjects 
with major depression and those with dysthymia differed 
only in frequency of insomnia (p = .034), lack of energy 
(p = .01), and the number of symptoms reported (9.6 ± 
1.9 versus 8.1 ± 1.9, respectively, t = 2.46, p = .016). Sim- 
ilarly, the number of symptoms reported was greater in 
subjects with mood disorders than in controls (2.66 ± 
3.2). However, the rate of depressive symptoms was high 
in controls, with more than 50% having at least one life- 
time symptom and 30% at least one current symptom. 
Lifetime Prevalence of Comorbid Psychiatric Disorders 
and Pathological Behaviors 
Most anxiety disorders and bulimia nervosa tended to 
be more frequent in subjects with affective disorders than 
in controls (Table 2). Generalized anxiety disorder was sig- 
niﬁcantly more frequent in both forms of affective dis- 
orders (p < .001), while separation anxiety disorder and 
phobic disorder were associated with major depression (p < 
.001). Only two adolescents (one with major depression, 
one with dysthymia) had histories of manic episodes and 
were diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

g Illicit drug use = lifetime use (at least once) of cannabis, inhalants, cocaine, opioids, hallucinogens, or amphetamines. 
In subjects with major depression, the frequency of 
suicide attempts and alcohol intoxication was higher 
than in controls (p < .001 and p = .04, respectively), and 
the frequency of illicit drug use tended to be higher (p = 
.08). Other pathological behaviors, including stealing, 
forgery, running away from home, school truancy, acts of 
cruelty, vandalism, and other delinquency, were associ- 
ated with neither major depression nor dysthymia. Only 
school suspension (p < .05) and chronic violation of rules 
at home or at school (p < .001) appeared signiﬁcantly 
associated with major depression and pathological lying 
with dysthymic disorder (p = .03). 
Compared with subjects who had a single mood dis- 
order, those with double depression had higher rates (p < 
.05) of suicide attempts (46%) and pathological behaviors 
(rule violation 46%, pathological lying 40%). Comor- 
bidity with anxiety disorders did not affect frequency of 
pathological behaviors. Relative to subjects with single epi- 
sodes of major depression, those with recurrent episodes 
had higher rates of separation anxiety disorder (50% versus 
18%, p = .03) and generalized anxiety disorder (39% ver- 
sus 15%, p = .11). 

The K-SADS-E interview records frequency and sever- 
ity of psychosocial stressors at the onset of depression. If 
both lifetime major depression and dysthymia were 
frequently associated with stressors at onset, in major 
depression the rate (85.7% versus 61.9%, Fisher exact 
test, p = .053) and severity of stressors (3.6 ± 1.47 versus 
2.72 ± 1.4, t = 2.32, p = .023) were greater. 
In addition, on self-report of life events during the pre- 
vious 12 months, personal events (i.e., illness, hospitaliza- 
tion, accident) did not appear to be associated with 



current affective disorder, while experiences of loss or 
threat of loss were signiﬁcantly more frequent in subjects 
with major depression (death of a close relative, parental 
separation, family disruption) and dysthymic disorder (ill- 
ness, hospitalization, or death of a close relative) (Table 3). 
There was no age trend in the frequency of life events. 

Globally, psychosocial functioning (CGAS score, mean 
± SD) was similar in subjects with current major depres- 
sion or dysthymia (62 ± 14.2 versus 67 ± 10.3, respectively, 
t = 26, p = .35) and signiﬁcantly impaired compared with 
controls with no current psychiatric diagnosis (84 ± 11; 
major depressive versus control subjects, t = –5.2, p < 
.0001; dysthymic versus control subjects, t = –6.32, p < 
.0001). Among subjects with current dysthymia (but not 
among those with current major depression), the CGAS 
score was negatively correlated with duration of the dis- 
order (Pearson r = –0.74, p = .006). 
There were no signiﬁcant differences between depressed 
subjects and controls regarding academic performance 
(Table 3), but subjects with major depression reported 
school difﬁculties related to their mood disorder more 
frequently than did subjects with dysthymia (57.1% versus 
14.3%, respectively, χ2 = 10.9, p = .001). The dysthymic 
subjects had poor family relationships (with mother, 
father, and siblings) more frequently than controls, and 
they were less active in sports (Table 3). 

Only 34.7% of subjects with major depression and 
23.8% of those with dysthymia had received medical 
attention for their mood disorder. Only 16% of the sub- 
jects with major depression and 5% of the dysthymic sub- 
jects had ever had contact with a psychiatrist (Table 4); on 
most treatment modalities, the major depressive subjects 
differed from controls, whereas the dysthymic subjects 
did not. Notably, many adolescents with major depression 
had been given sedative drugs. 
There was no difference in the frequency of any treat- 
ment received according to number of major depressive 
episodes or diagnosis of double versus single depression.

Depressed subjects with a history of suicide attempts (n = 
19), compared with those without (n = 54), had more 
outpatient psychiatric visits (38% versus 7%, p = .008) 
and tended to have been hospitalized more frequently for 
psychological problems (23% versus 5%, p = .073) and 
to have received antidepressant treatment more often 
(15% versus 2%, p = .086). 


Prior to discussing results, some limitations of this 
study should be mentioned. First, the study design did 
not permit an estimate of the prevalence of affective dis- 
orders in adolescents. Individuals who received diagnoses 
of major depression or dysthymia at stage II appeared to 
be distributed across all three groups at stage I, because 
high scores on the Kandel Depressive Mood Inventory 
identify subjects with current depressive symptoms but 
do not screen for all current (and a fortiori past) cases of 
mood disorders. Furthermore, many adolescent girls (n = 
14) reporting eating disorder symptoms at stage I had 
diagnoses of affective disorder at stage II. This may 
explain our elevated female-male ratio and the relatively 
high frequency of depressed girls suffering from bulimia 
nervosa. Second, subjects with current and past depres- 
sion were often combined for comparisons with other 
groups. Third, the study used a lifetime diagnostic instru- 
ment, leading to frequent retrospective diagnoses. This is 
a strong limitation, as a retrospective approach usually 
underestimates many factors. Fourth, the list of life 
events assessed was limited (not including, notably, his- 
tory of sexual abuse or physical neglect). Finally, due to 
confidentiality and feasibility issues, parents were not 
interviewed about their children. 

Major depression and dysthymic disorder have very 
close symptomatology. This is not surprising as they share 
common diagnostic criteria in current psychiatric classiﬁ- 
cations. However, our investigation included numerous 
variables (i.e., pathological behaviors) which are not clini- 
cal criteria of either major depression or dysthymia. Only 
a few clinical variables were signiﬁcantly associated with 
one speciﬁc form of affective disorder: insomnia, lack of 
energy, suicide attempt, school suspension, and disobe- 
dience were associated with major depression, and dura- 
tion of illness was associated with dysthymia. Although 
the association of suicidal behavior with major depression 
and duration of illness with dysthymia are expected, the 
ﬁnding that depressed individuals reported frequent dis- 
obedience is more surprising. Kovacs et al. (1994) found 
disobedience to be frequent in dysthymic disorder. Our 
rate (30%) of dysthymic individuals, who had a comor- 
bid diagnosis of major depression resulting in a so-called 
“double depression,” is lower than the rate (nearly 70%) 
reported in two previous studies (Ferro et al., 1994; 
Kovacs et al., 1994) but higher than that (17%) in the 
most recent report (Goodman et al., 2000). 
Our results also highlight the frequency of symptoms 
of affective disorders and feelings belonging to the depres- 
sive spectrum in normal adolescents (30%). These ﬁnd- 
ings are similar to those previously reported (McClure 
et al., 1997; Roberts et al., 1995). Horwath et al. (1992) 



estimated that 50% of adults with depressive symptoms 
are at risk of developing major depression. It can reasona- 
bly be assumed that adolescents carry a similar risk. This is 
important because of the unfortunate prevailing belief 
that depression during adolescence is normal and does not 
need to be treated. 

In adolescents with depressive disorders, comorbidity 
with anxiety disorders was high, especially with general- 
ized anxiety disorder, phobic disorder, and separation 
anxiety disorder. This ﬁnding supports previous studies, 
in both clinical (e.g., Biederman et al., 1995; Ryan et al., 
1987) and community samples (e.g., Angold and 
Costello, 1993; Kovacs et al., 1994; Lewinsohn et al., 
1995; Rhode et al., 1991). We cannot exclude that 
comorbidity of major depression with bulimia nervosa 
could be partly explained by the study design (which 
overselected for stage II subjects with eating problems). 
Nevertheless, although few epidemiological studies on 
affective disorders in adolescents include systematic 
search for eating disorders, increasing evidence of a rela- 
tionship between major depression and eating disorders 
exists in clinical samples (Lilenfeld et al., 1998). Unlike 
in previous U.S. studies, especially those conducted in 
urban sites (Angold and Costello, 1993; Birmaher et al., 
1996; Rey, 1994), we found few individuals with conduct 
disorder among adolescents with affective disorders. Two 
hypotheses may explain this ﬁnding: ﬁrst, this comorbid- 
ity is more frequent in boys than in girls (Lewinsohn 
et al., 1995; Rey, 1994), and our female-male ratio is 
high; second, urbanization was low in the districts where 
the survey was conducted. Adolescents with major 
depression reported more episodes of alcohol intoxica- 
tion and tended to use illicit drugs more frequently than 
controls. These data are consistent with previous research 
showing a link between depression and substance use 
among adolescents (Galaif et al., 1998). However, cross- 
sectional data does not permit the assessment of the tem- 
poral relationship between the two. 

Our results show that psychosocial functioning is sig- 
niﬁcantly impaired in both major depression and dysthy- 
mic disorder. While impairment has been widely 
documented in adolescent major depression (i.e., Puig- 
Antich et al., 1993), to our knowledge few studies have 
focused on psychosocial consequences of adolescent dys- 
thymia (Goodman et al., 2000; Hoberman et al., 1996; 
Olsson et al., 1999). Several reports have suggested that 
adolescents with two or more depressive episodes have 
poorer functioning than those with a single episode (Rao 
et al., 1995; Warner et al., 1995). In this study, the dura- 
tion of dysthymic disorder negatively correlated with 
psychosocial functioning. Similarly, in a study by Olsson 
et al. (1999), adolescents with long-lasting depressive 
symptoms had more limited social interaction, and in the 
study by Goodman et al. (2000), subjects with double 
depression were more impaired than those with a single 
diagnosis. These ﬁndings emphasize the need for early 
diagnosis and treatment of adolescent dysthymia, before 
it becomes chronic or major depression develops (Kovacs 
et al., 1994). This is additionally supported by the ﬁnd- 
ings in a long-term outcome study by Klein et al. (1997): 
compared with subjects with history of major depression 
or nonaffective disorder in adolescence, those with a his- 
tory of dysthymia had the poorest outcome as adults. 

Along with other reports on factors associated with 
onset and duration of major depression and dysthymia, 
our results suggest that stressful life events and family dys- 
function play an important role in affective disorders of 
adolescence (Birmaher et al., 1996; Goodyer et al., 1997). 
However, our ﬁndings also suggest that major depression 
and dysthymic disorder in adolescents may be linked to 
distinct patterns of associated factors, with regard to expe- 
riences of loss and family climate. This last point was 
recently reported by Olsson et al. (1999) in a case-control 
study, but it was not supported by Goodman et al. (2000). 
Additional discussion on the subject is outside of the scope 
of this study but would deserve speciﬁc research. 

Psychosocial factors associated with help seeking 
among adolescents reporting depressive feelings (stage I of 
the study) have been published elsewhere: girls, older ado- 
lescents, adolescents with parents living apart, adolescents 
with health worries, adolescents with suicidal ideation, 
and adolescents frequently absent from school all sought 
help more often than others (Gasquet et al., 1997). How- 
ever, at stage II of the study, our results conﬁrm the low 
rate of adolescents with mood disorders who beneﬁt from 
specific care for their disorder. The U.S. studies have 
emphasized the limitation to help seeking due to socio- 
economic factors (Newacheck, 1989; Saunders et al., 


1994). However, in France, where the health care system 
covers nearly all adolescents and provides free access to 
medical care, we found the same level of untreated adoles- 
cents with affective disorders (nearly 70%) as in the U.S. 
studies (79% and 82% according to Lewinsohn et al. 
[1994] and Keller et al. [1991], respectively). Our results 
are also surprising if we take into account the fact that 
80% of all adolescents had outpatient visits with general 
practitioners during the previous year (Gasquet et al., 
1997). We can therefore hypothesize that there are other 
factors which may explain that major depression and dys- 
thymia are underdiagnosed and undertreated in adoles- 
cents. Regarding the health system in France, these factors 
might be the following: (1) low sensitivity of general prac- 
titioners to mental disorders, at least in adolescents; (2) 
reluctance of parents to encourage professional help seek- 
ing or of family physicians to refer to a psychiatrist; (3) 
lack of training in adolescent psychopathology; (4) poor 
knowledge of evidence-based treatment for depression in 
this age group, leading to inadequate prescriptions; (5) the 
possibility of stigma associated with mental illness. How- 
ever, it is likely that other factors also contribute to a low 
level of mental health care among adolescents, including 
youth attitudes toward help sources and the nature of 
depressive symptomatology (Hoberman et al., 1996). It is 
interesting to note that depressed subjects who had 
attempted suicide had received more psychiatric outpa- 
tient treatment than those who had not attempted suicide. 
Although we have no way of knowing whether treatment 
was directly related to suicide attempt, it seems likely that 
suicidality might have brought these youngsters to the 
attention of medical authorities. 

Together with other recent reports, the results presented 
provide strong evidence that major depression and dysthy- 
mia are underdiagnosed and undertreated in adolescence, 
although their consequences on psychosocial functioning 
are severe. Our results also suggest that major depression 
and dysthymia, although they share similar clinical fea- 
tures, may have distinct patterns of associated factors. 
There is some evidence that duration of illness affects psy- 
chosocial consequences in adolescents with mood dis- 
orders, which emphasizes the need for early identiﬁcation 
and effective treatment. Despite free access to health care 
in France, the rate of treatment seeking for mood disorder 
is similar to that reported in U.S. sites, suggesting that fac- 
tors other than socioeconomic variables are involved.
