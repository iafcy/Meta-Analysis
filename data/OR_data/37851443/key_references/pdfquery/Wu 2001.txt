Factors Associated With Use of 
Mental Health Services for Depression 
by Children and Adolescents 
Objective: This study examined patterns of mental health service use 
among depressed children and adolescents and factors associated with 
help seeking and treatment modalities. Methods: The sample consist- 
ed of 206 children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years who were as- 
sessed as part of a larger survey of mental health service use in five 
service systems and in the community and who met DSM-III-R criteria 
for depressive disorders (major depression or dysthymia). Results: 
Among the 206 children, 75 (36 percent) never received professional 
help for depressive symptoms. Among the 131 children who received 
professional help for depression, antidepressants were prescribed for 
40 (31 percent) in the year before the interview. The findings indicate 
possible undertreatment of depression among children and adoles- 
cents, especially among African Americans. Socioeconomic factors, 
such as the mother’s education and the child’s health insurance, were 
not associated with receiving professional help for depressive symp- 
toms but were associated with receiving antidepressants. Parental per- 
ception of a child’s mental health service need was associated with re- 
ceiving professional help but not with receiving antidepressants. Also, 
depressed children were more likely to receive antidepressants when 
they had life-threatening or severe symptoms, such as a suicide at- 
tempt or drug abuse. Conclusions: Whether a depressed child receives 
mental health services and the types of treatment received are influ- 
enced by different individual and family factors and by the type of 
symptoms exhibited. Better understanding of these factors will help in 
meeting the service needs of depressed children and adolescents.

increasing rates of depression 
and a shift to a younger age of 
onset (1–4). Depression is one of the 
leading risk factors for suicide among 
children and adolescents (5,6). 
The Epidemiologic Catchment 
Area study (7) found that about one- 
third of adults who suffered from a 
major depressive disorder had not 
sought treatment. In a review of stud- 
ies of adult depression, Hirshfeld and 
associates (8) found serious under- 
treatment of persons with depression, 
even though effective treatments 
have been available for several 
decades. They concluded that pa- 
tient-associated reasons for under- 
treatment include failure to recognize 
symptoms, limited access to services, 
lack of insurance, fear of being stig- 
matized, and noncompliance with 
treatment. A further conclusion was 
that inadequate training of health 
care providers and barriers created by 
mental health care delivery systems 
also contribute to undertreatment. 
The cost to individuals, families, and 
society of undertreatment is substan- 
tial (8–10). 
The situation of children who need 
mental health services is no different 
from that of adults: many children re- 
ceive inappropriate services (11) or 
no services at all (12–14). Children 
with depressive disorders are less

(30–31). A diagnostic criterion was 
considered to be positive if reported 
by either the parent or the child (30). 
Depressive disorders included major 
depression and dysthymia. The num- 
ber of depressive symptoms was also 
included in the analysis as an indica- 
tor of severity. Other mental disor- 
ders included anxiety disorders, dis- 
ruptive disorders, and substance use 
disorders. 
Impairment was 
measured by the Child Global Assess- 
ment Scale (CGAS). The CGAS 
scores range from 1 to 100, with a 
lower score representing greater im- 
pairment. The interviewer’s rating, 
based on the parent interview with 
satisfactory validity, was used (25). 
Service use and perceived need 
Child mental health service use 
for depression. Specific questions 
about service use for depression, in- 
cluding treatment and medications 
received, were asked for children 
who met the NIMH-DISC criteria 
for depression (30). As with the DISC 
diagnoses, treatment 
information 
from the parent and the child was ag- 
gregated. In addition, in the non- 
DISC service use section, the parent 
and child were asked about the child’s 
treatments and medications for emo- 
tional, behavioral, and drug prob- 
lems. We used two variables in our 
analysis: whether the child had ever 
been seen by a health professional— 
psychiatrist, psychologist, physician, 
social worker, or guidance counselor 
—for depressive symptoms, and 
whether the child used an antidepres- 
sant in the previous year. 
Parental perception of a child’s 
service needs and unmet needs. 
Parents were asked if they believed 
their children needed any mental 
health service (perceived need) and 
whether any had been received. A 
perception of unmet need was 
recorded if a parent reported that a 
child’s need for services was not met. 
This measure is imprecise, however, 
because a child could have been re- 
ceiving services but the parent may 
still have believed that the need had 
not been met. 

likely to receive mental health servic- 
es than children with disruptive disor- 
ders (15–17). 
Individual characteristics found to 
affect child mental health service uti- 
lization include the child’s age (18– 
20), gender (18,20–22), ethnicity (19– 
21,23), physical illness (24), and level 
of functioning (17,25,26). Family 
characteristics include socioeconomic 
status (19,22,24) and the parents’ use 
of mental health services (22), their 
perception of the child’s need for 
mental health services and whether 
the need was met (17), and their per- 
ceived burden (27). All these factors, 
with the exception of perceived 
parental burden, were taken into ac- 
count in this study. 
Most studies of child and adoles- 
cent mental health service need and 
service use have not examined the as- 
sociation between service use and 
specific psychiatric disorders. Little 
is known about the factors that affect 
mental health service use for depres- 
sion or the types of treatment re- 
ceived by children with depression. 
In this context, our study addressed 
three questions: What are the factors 
associated with receiving profession- 
al help for childhood depression? 
What are the factors associated with 
receiving antidepressants for depres- 
sion? Are there shared and unique 
factors associated with receiving pro- 
fessional help and receiving antide- 
pressants? 
Methods 
Sample and data 
Our analysis used data from a group 
of 206 children and adolescents aged 
9 to 17 years who met DSM-III-R cri- 
teria for depressive disorders (major 
depression or dysthymic disorder). 
This group is a subsample of a survey 
of mental health service need and 
service utilization among children 
and adolescents from nonresidential 
child service systems and the commu- 
nity in Westchester County, New 
York (28). The group comprises all 
the subjects in the Westchester study 
who met criteria for depressive disor- 
ders. 
The Westchester study included 
763 children and adolescents ran- 
domly selected from five child serv- 
ice systems: mental health, substance 
use, child welfare, special education, 
and probation. The study also includ- 
ed 533 children and adolescents re- 
cruited from the community, includ- 
ing 360 children from the Westch- 
ester site of the Methods for the Epi- 
demiology of Child and Adolescent 
Mental Disorders (MECA) study by 
the National Institute of Mental 
Health (NIMH) (29–32), selected 
from the same sampling frame and 
assessed with identical measures of 
child psychopathology, impairment, 
and service use. 
The child and one parent or 
guardian in each household were in- 
terviewed for approximately three 
hours by trained interviewers about 
childhood psychopathology, mental 
health service use, and a wide array 
of risk factors (29,32). 
Measures of psychopathology 
and impairment 
Depression and other mental dis- 
orders. Children’s depression and 
other mental disorders in the six 
months preceding the interview were 
assessed by the NIMH Diagnostic In- 
terview Schedule for Children (DISC) 
(DSM-III-R) or DISC 2.3 (30). The 
validity and reliability of the measures 
reported elsewhere 
have been 

Maternal mental health service 
use. We used two variables in the 
parent interview: whether the bio- 











subsequent multivariate analyses, a 
dummy variable—services versus 
community—was included to control 
for differences in the community and 
service systems samples. 
Univariate analyses 
Of the 206 depressed children, 131 
(64 percent) received professional 
help; 75 (36 percent) did not seek 
professional help for depressive 
symptoms. Table 1 shows the family 
and individual characteristics of de- 
pressed children who received pro- 
fessional help compared with those 
who did not. African-American 
youth were less likely to receive pro- 
fessional help than those from other 
ethnic groups. As expected, de- 
pressed children who received pro- 
fessional help were more likely to 
have a greater number of depressive 
symptoms and more impairment 
than those who did not receive such 
help. Mothers of depressed children 
who received professional help re- 
ported greater use of mental health 
services and medication for their 
own psychiatric problems and were 
more likely to think that their chil- 
dren needed mental health services 
than mothers of depressed children 
who did not receive help. 
Among the 131 children who re- 
ceived professional help, antidepres- 
sants were prescribed for 40 (31 per- 
cent) in the year before the inter- 
view. As Table 1 shows, children who 
received antidepressants were signif- 
icantly more likely than children who 
did not to be white, to have a moth- 
er who had received professional 
help and antidepressants, and to be 
more impaired. Families of children 
who received antidepressants also 
had a higher average income and a 
higher level of maternal education 
and were more likely to have private 
insurance. Children who received 
antidepressants were also more like- 
ly to meet criteria for substance 
abuse disorders and to have recently 
attempted suicide. 
Multivariate Analyses 
Table 2 shows the results of two logis- 
tic regression analyses. Because the 
results shown in Table 1 indicated 
that the major ethnic difference was 
between African Americans and oth- 

1 
logical mother had ever been seen by 
any mental health professional for a 
psychological or emotional problem, 
and whether the biological mother 
ever took any medication for a psy- 
chological or emotional problem. 
Sociodemographic factors 
Data on each child’s gender, age, race 
or ethnicity, household income, ma- 
ternal education, and health insur- 
ance status were used in the analyses. 
Health insurance status was classified 
as no insurance, Medicaid, or private 
insurance (which included all non- 
Medicaid health insurance). 
Analysis 
We were mainly interested in two bi- 
nary dependent variables: whether 
the depressed children had received 
professional help for depression, and 
whether those who received profes- 
sional help received antidepressants. 
A univariate analysis was first con- 
ducted to compare sociodemographic 
characteristics, other psychiatric dis- 
orders, and other factors of depressed 
children who received professional 
help with those who never received 
any professional help for depression. 
Among those who received profes- 
sional help, univariate analysis was 
used to compare those who received 
antidepressants with those who did 
not. A chi square test was used for 
categorical variables, and a t test was 
used for continuous variables. 
Multiple logistic regression analysis 
was used to identify factors that af- 
fected mental health service use for 
depression among all depressed chil- 
dren. For those who received help, 
the same method was used to identify 
the factors differentiating those who 
were taking antidepressants from 
those who were not. 
The two dependent variables—re- 
ceipt of professional help and receipt 
of antidepressants—correspond to 
the two dichotomies of the service 
use hierarchy; the comparison for an- 
tidepressant treatment was nested 
within the comparison for getting 
professional help. Therefore, in the 
last stage of our analysis, we used a 
nested response model (33) to exam- 
ine whether the factors affecting re- 
ceipt of professional help for depres- 
sion were the same as those affecting 
receipt of antidepressants. The mod- 
el was tested using the SAS general- 
ized linear models (GENMOD) pro- 
cedure (34). 
Results 
Sample description 
Of the 206 depressed children and 
adolescents, 116 (56 percent) were 
girls, 82 (40 percent) were white, 71 
(35 percent) were African American, 
38 (18 percent) were Hispanic, and 
15 (7 percent) were other. The mean 
age±SD was 14.4±2.3 years. Thirty- 
nine children in the community sam- 
ple (7.3 percent) and 167 children in 
the child service systems sample (21.9 
percent) were depressed. 
Comparisons of demographic and 
socioeconomic characteristics of de- 
pressed children from the communi- 
ty with those from the service systems 
show that depressed children from 
the service systems were more likely 
to be boys, to be ethnic minorities, to 
be from disadvantaged families with a 
low income, and to be on Medicaid 
(data not shown). These notable dif- 
ferences between the children from 
the community and those from serv- 
ice systems were anticipated. In the

mental health services and were less 
likely to report unmet need. Girls 
tended to receive professional help 
more often than boys, and children 
with disruptive disorders were less 
likely than other depressed children 
to receive treatment for depression. 
Among children who received pro- 
fessional help, factors significantly as- 

1 

er ethnic groups, African Americans 
were compared with all other ethnic 
groups in the logistic regression 
analysis. Table 2 shows the adjusted 
odds ratios and confidence intervals 
for the analysis comparing depressed 
children who received professional 
help with those who never received 
any help and for the analysis compar- 
ing those who received antidepres- 
sants with those who did not. 
As shown in Table 2, children who 
received professional help for depres- 
sion were significantly less likely to be 
African American, had more depres- 
sive symptoms, and were more im- 
paired. Their parents were also more 
likely to report that the child needed

1 Service is controlled for. Coefficients are not shown. 
2 The results of the nested response model indicate that the impact of this factor is significantly different (p<.05) on depressed children’s seeking pro- 


depression and compared factors af- 
fecting the use of professional help 
and treatment with antidepressants 
for childhood depression. 
Consistent with findings of studies 
of adults (7,8), depression appears to 
be undertreated among children and 
adolescents, especially among African 
Americans (21,35,36). However, it 
has been suggested that African- 
American youth more frequently seek 
help for psychological symptoms 
from nonprofessional domains such 
as church and family before seeking 
formal mental health services than do 
whites (37). Further research in this 
area is needed. 
After the analysis controlled for 
other possible confounding factors, 
depressed girls appeared to be some- 
what more likely to receive profes- 
sional help for depression than boys. 
This gender difference is consistent 
with that found among adults (38,39). 
However, among children who re- 

1 
sociated with receiving antidepres- 
sants included being male, a higher 
level of maternal education, comor- 
bid substance use disorders, a recent 
suicide attempt, and greater impair- 
ment. Children from families with 
private health insurance tended to re- 
ceive antidepressants more often 
than those from families with no in- 
surance. 
As discussed above, we were inter- 
ested in identifying factors that af- 
fected whether children received 
professional help for depression and 
that influenced whether antidepres- 
sant medication was prescribed for 
those who received help. In addition, 
we wanted to identify shared and 
unique factors associated with receiv- 
ing professional help and antidepres- 
sants. Because the comparison of 
children who received antidepres- 
sants was nested within the compari- 
son of children who received profes- 
sional help, the model of nested re- 
sponses (33) was applied to the data. 
We identified four factors with dif- 
ferential impact on the receipt of pro- 
fessional help for childhood depres- 
sion compared with the use of antide- 
pressants among those receiving pro- 
fessional help. Girls were more likely 
to receive professional help for de- 
pression; however, among all those 
who received help, boys were more 
likely to receive antidepressants 
(p<.01). Also, the mother’s education 
and the child’s comorbid substance 
use disorders and previous suicide at- 
tempt were significantly related to 
antidepressant treatment (p<.05) but 
not to receiving professional help for 
depression. 
Discussion and conclusions 
Most studies of child mental health 
service use have not examined service 
use in terms of a specific disorder. 
The study reported here assessed 
child mental health service use for

ceived professional help for depres- 
sion, boys were more likely to receive 
antidepressants. These findings sug- 
gest that the gender effect may differ 
by types of service and treatment. 
More studies are needed to replicate 
these findings. 
Family socioeconomic characteris- 
tics did not appear to be significant 
factors in whether children received 
professional help, but they did play an 
important role in whether antidepres- 
sants were prescribed. Children who 
received antidepressants were more 
likely to come from families of higher 
socioeconomic status. Although the 
association with income disappeared 
in the multivariate analyses, the 
mother’s education remained a signif- 
icant predictor, suggesting that pa- 
rental knowledge of depression and 
of available medications for treat- 
ment may influence the type of serv- 
ices received. 
Like other studies (40,41), our find- 
ings did not show a correlation be- 
tween having insurance and receiving 
professional help for depression. 
However, among children receiving 
such help, those with private insur- 
ance tended to be somewhat more 
likely to receive antidepressants than 
those with no insurance. These find- 
ings suggest that studies examining 
mental health service use without si- 
multaneously exploring the type of 
treatment received may not reveal— 
and may consequently underesti- 
mate—the impact of having health 
insurance. The impact of insurance 
on different types of treatment for 
depression and possibly other disor- 
ders should be explored. 
Consistent with previous studies 
(26,40), our results indicate that level 
of impairment and severity of depres- 
sion (number of depressive symp- 
toms) were related to receiving men- 
tal health services. The occurrence of 
other disorders did not appear to be 
related to a child’s receiving profes- 
sional help for depression. However, 
among children who received such 
help, those who received antidepres- 
sants were more likely to have a co- 
morbid substance use disorder and 
to have had a previous suicide at- 
tempt. This finding is consistent with 
previous studies (1) and suggests 
that children with depression are 
more likely to receive antidepres- 
sants if they have some life-threaten- 
ing or severe symptoms, such as a 
suicide attempt and drug abuse. 
In summary, our findings suggest 
that parental failure to recognize de- 
pressive symptoms, lack of knowl- 
edge about depression and its related 
treatment, and lack of adequate health 
insurance may all influence whether 
or not a child receives services as well 
as the type of treatment received. 
Mental health education should be 
offered to parents to improve early 
identification and treatment of de- 
pressed children and adolescents. 
A limitation of this study is that the 
information on treatment for depres- 
sion was limited, as we did not have a 
measure of psychotherapy. Conse- 
quently, the children who did not re- 
ceive antidepressant treatment could 
have received anything from a single 
evaluation to a full range of treatment 
without antidepressants. It is also 
possible that some depressed chil- 
dren who received antidepressants 
had previously received another type 
of treatment. Therefore, we do not 
mean to imply that children who re- 
ceived antidepressants got better 
service than those who did not. 
In fact, the literature indicates that 
although both psychotherapy and 
pharmacotherapy have been found to 
be beneficial for depressive disorders, 
children do not seem to respond to 
antidepressants as well as adults do 
(1,42–45). Psychotherapy has been 
recommended as the first treatment 
for most depressed youth, with anti- 
depressants considered only for those 
with more severe depression, bipolar 
disorder, and depression with psy- 
chotic features and those who do not 
respond to psychotherapeutic inter- 
vention (1). Future research, includ- 
ing detailed treatment information, is 
needed. 
Finally, because of the low preva- 
lence of depression, data from our 
community and service systems sam- 
ples were combined to increase the 
power of the analysis. Although sam- 
ple differences were statistically con- 
trolled and detailed analyses were 
conducted to ensure that our findings 
were not due to sample differences, a 
large-scale study is needed to repli- 
cate these findings. (cid:1)
