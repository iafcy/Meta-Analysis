This study describes 4 help-seeking steps among children at high risk for attention deficit hyperac- 
tivity disorder (ADHD), and identifies barriers to ADHD symptom detection and treatment. Using a 
district-wide stratified random sample of 1615 elementary school students screened for ADHD risk, 
predictors of 4 help-seeking steps among a high-risk group (n = 389) and parent-identified barriers 
to care among children with unmet need for ADHD care (n = 91) were assessed. Study findings 
indicate that although 88% of chiMren were recognized as having a problem, only 39% had been 
evaluated, 32% received an ADHD diagnosis, and 23% received current treatment. Older children 
and those with more severe behavior problems were more likely to be perceived by their parents as 
having a problem. Additionally, gender and ethnic disparities in the subsequent help-seeking process 
emerged. Boys had over 5 times the odds than girls of receiving an evaluation, an ADHD diagnosis, 
and treatment. Compared to African American youth, Caucasian children had twice the odds of tak- 
ing these help-seeking steps. For those children with unmet need for ADHD care, poverty predicted 
lower treatment rates and was associated with the most pervasive barriers. The gap between parental 
problem recognition and seeking services suggests that thresholds for parental recognition of a child 
behavior problem and for seeking ADHD services may be different. Future research examining the 
help-seeking process for ADHD should include a qualitative component to explore the potential 
mechanisms for gender and ethnic differences.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common child psychiatric disorder for which 
efficacious pharmacological and psychosocial treatments have been established. 1-5 Nevertheless, 
ADHD treatment use has been reported to vary by child and system characteristics, 6-1a and little 
is known about how barriers in the help-seeking process may underlie these differences. Several 
studies indicate that girls and children from minority backgrounds are significantly less likely to 
receive ADHD treatment, including psychotropic medications, than are boys and Caucasian children 
respectively. 6'8-11,13-15 Previous studies have not addressed whether variations in parental problem 
recognition contribute to these well-established gender and race differences in ADHD treatment 
utilization. 
Help-seeking pathway models propose a series of links between the initial recognition of a child 
mental health problem and the eventual use of mental health services. Such pathways are defined 
as "a sequence of contacts with individuals and organizations prompted by the distressed person's 
efforts, and those of his/her significant others, to seek help as well as the help that is supplied in 
response to such efforts. ''16 For young children, parent or teacher recognition of a mental health 
problem usually serves as the first step of this process, which may be followed by steps to obtain 
an assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. Throughout this process, predisposing, enabling, and need 
factors are theorized to be influential. 17,18 Adapting the help-seeking pathway model of Srebnik et al 
to elementary school-aged children with ADHD symptoms, predisposing characteristics in this study 
include gender, 8,1Â°,11,19,z0 race, 10'11'21'22 age, 19 and socioeconomic status (SES). 23-26 Three service 
factors that are anticipated to potentially enable detection and help-seeking for ADHD symptoms 
having a regular source for routine pediatric care, 22"30'31 and 
include health insurance coverage, 
receiving special education services for specific learning disabilities or emotional handicap. 32,33 In 
addition, several studies have explored the potential effect of disorder characteristics on help-seeking 
and service use19'24'29'34'35; thus, this study's model adjusts for need by including behavior problem 
severity as measured by standardized parent and teacher ADHD ratings. 

A more detailed understanding of the relevant barriers and facilitators in the help-seeking process 
for ADHD symptoms is essential to promote equitable access to care for this treatable condition. This 
study therefore has 3 objectives. Using a district-wide sample of elementary school students at high 
risk for ADHD, the study's first goal is to describe the rates of 4 help-seeking steps; namely, recogniz- 
ing a child problem, seeking an evaluation, obtaining a professional diagnosis, and securing ADHD 
treatment. The second objective is to examine whether these help-seeking steps vary by child gender 
or ethnicity, after controlling for socio-economic status (SES) and enabling and need variables. Third, 
this study seeks to describe barriers to service use from the perspective of parents whose children meet 
DSM-IV criteria for ADHD and have not utilized any mental health services in the prior 12 months. 


Following study and informed consent procedures approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
the University of Florida and the school district research director, a 2-phase study was conducted. 
To screen for parental problem recognition and high-risk ADHD status, parent telephone interviews 
were performed between October through December of 1998. Follow-up home interviews were then 
conducted with respondents who screened positive between May of 1999 through July of 2000. 

Using school district registration records, 12 009 elementary school students enrolled in kinder- 
garten through fifth grade during the 1998-99 academic year in a North Central Florida public school 



district were identified as eligible from a student population of 13 180. Children were eligible for 
the study if they lived in a household with a telephone, were not receiving special education ser- 
vices for mental retardation or autism, and were from Caucasian or African American backgrounds. 
Children from other ethnic backgrounds were excluded because they comprised less than 5% of the 
total student population. Selection was restricted to 1 child per household. From this pool of 12 009 
eligible children, 3158 were chosen using a gender-stratified random design that oversampled girls 
by a margin of 2 to 1 to ensure adequate representation. Telephone contact was made with 78% of 
the selected sample (n = 2035) and of these, 79% (n = 1615) agreed to participate. Parent permission 
for teacher behavior questionnaires was obtained for 96% (n = 1549) of the respondents, and 77% 
(n = 1187) of the mailed teacher questionnaires were completed and returned. Of 1615 children 
screened, 24% (n = 381) were identified as being diagnosed or treated for ADHD, suspected of hav- 
ing ADHD, or there was parental concern about behavior problems in children with parent scores of 
the Swanson-Nolan-and-Pelham-IV (SNAP-IV), a standardized parent or teacher symptom screen- 
ing measure, 36 elevated 1.5 standard deviations above the norm. From this pool of 381 children, 
70% (n = 266) participated in follow-up home interviews that included diagnostic and service use 
assessments. Thirty-four percent (n = 91) of these children met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD and had 
not received ADHD treatment in the past 12 months. 
Two separate samples were used for this study. For the help-seeking analysis, 389 children were 
selected who were deemed at high risk for ADHD because they scored greater than 2 standard devi- 
ations above the norm on the parent or the teacher SNAP-IV screening measure, or they had received 
a previous diagnosis of ADHD or were currently under treatment for ADHD. For the barriers to care 
analysis, the sample was the 91 children meeting DSM-IV criteria for ADHD identified as having 
unmet service needs for ADHD care in the past year. See Figure 1 for a flow diagram of the design. 


Recognizing aproblem. Parents were asked whether they had any general concerns that their child 
may have an emotional or behavioral problem (ie, overactivity, impulsivity, inattention, or poor

concentration), whether they suspected that their child had ADHD, attention deficit disorder (ADD), 
attention deficit, or hyperactivity, whether school staff had voiced general concerns or suspicions of 
ADHD, or whether their child ever had a professional evaluation for ADHD. If the child had received 
an ADHD diagnosis by a professional, he or she was identified as having "diagnosed ADHD." A child 
was categorized as having "suspected ADHD" if either the parents and/or school staff had a suspicion 
of ADHD, but no diagnostic assessment had been sought. Children whose parents and/or school staff 
had concerns about the child's emotions or behavior (ie, activity level, impulsivity, inattention, or 
poor concentration), but no suspicion or diagnosis of ADHD were classified as "general behavioral 
concerns." High-risk children in the "no concern" category were coded as not recognized. High-risk 
children were coded as recognized if their parents endorsed any level of concern or if the child was 
diagnosed with ADHD. 
Seeking a professional evaluation. A child was classified as having received a professional eval- 
uation if the parents indicated that they had sought an assessment from a primary care physician 
(ie pediatricians or family practitioners) or from a mental health specialist (ie general or child psy- 
chiatrist, psychologist, or social worker) in response to the question, "Has (child's name) ever been 
professionally evaluated for ADHD or attention deficit/hyperactivity?" 
Obtaining a professional ADHD diagnosis. Parents further answered the open-ended question 
"What did the professional say was the matter with (child's name)?" and the closed-ended question, 
"Did the professional make a diagnosis of ADHD, ADD or attention deficit disorder or hyperac- 
tivity?" These answers were examined for consistency between the 2 question types, and found to 
be congruent. Thus, if the closed-ended question was answered as "Yes" the child was classified as 
having been assigned an ADHD diagnosis. 
Receiving ADHD treatment. Children were classified as receiving treatment if parents answered 
yes to the question, "Is (child's name) currently under treatment for ADHD, ADD, attention deficit 
disorder or hyperactivity?" 

Sociodemographic characteristics, including gender, age, race, and lunch subsidy status, were ob- 
tained from school district administrative records. Based on federal government guidelines involving 
family income, lunch status was identified as subsidized or nonsubsidized, with subsidized lunch 
corresponding to lower SES. SES scores also were calculated using the Hollingshead 4-factor index, 
which could range from 8 (lowest social strata), to 66 (highest strata), with scores from 8 to 32 
classified as "low" and scores from 33 to 66 classified as "high" SES. The factors used to calculate 
this score included parental education and occupation. 37 

Detailed health insurance information was obtained during the telephone survey. For this study, 
a distinction was made between children with and without any type of health insurance. Parents 
indicated during the telephone survey whether their child had a regular source of routine pediatric 
care or not, and where such care was received. Sources of routine care were coded as "none," "private 
source" if received in a private doctor's office, or "other," which could include hospital clinics and 
public health departments. Information about receipt of special education services was obtained from 
school district administrative records. 

Severity of behavior problems was assessed using parent and teacher report forms of the Swanson- 
Nolan-and-Pelham-IV (SNAP-IV) checklist, a rating scale consisting of operationalized DSM-IV 
criteria for ADHD. 36 Internal consistency and 2-week test-retest reliability are high, and gender and 


age norms for average ratings per item (ARI) are established. 36 Children were identified as being 
high-risk if any of the parent- or teacher-ADHD ARI scores fell 2 standard deviations above the 
norm. Additionally, children were included in the risk group if they had been previously diagnosed 
with ADHD or were currently receiving ADHD treatment. 

Using a 20-item measure developed for the Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent 
Mental Disorders study, 26'38 barriers to care were assessed among children who had met DSM-IV 
criteria for ADHD and who had not received any treatment in the previous 12 months. Parents 
indicated whether they experienced any of the specific barriers, and individual barrier items were 
assigned to 1 of 5 barrier categories. Five items were assigned to system barriers (eg could not get 
an appointment), 4 items to barriers indicating stigma (eg concerned what others were thinking), 3 
items to barriers indicating no perceived need (eg problem got better by itself), 3 items to financial 
barriers (eg it was too expensive), and 4 items to barriers indicating negative expectations (eg thought 
treatment could not help). The overall summary barrier score could range from 0 to 20. Although 
the reliability and validity of this barrier inquiry have not been formally tested, internal consistency 
was good (Crohnbach ot = .60), consistent with previous estimates among a similar study population 
(or = .64). 39 

Diagnoses of ADHD were made using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Version 4.0 
(DISC-4) based on DSM-IV criteria. 40 Diagnoses were generated from parent interviews, because 
previous studies aggregating data from parents and children found that parents alone were effective 
informants for disruptive disorders. 41 Consistent with DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, the DISC-Version 
4.0 inquires about symptoms and impairment across school and home settings. In its earlier versions, 
the DISC has been shown to have moderate to high test-retest reliability and internal consistency. 42-45 

Estimates were adjusted for sample design and differential response using analytic weights com- 
puted in a procedure outlined by Aday. 46 This process was made possible by the availability of 
administrative data (gender, race, lunch subsidy status, special education category) for all eligible 
students. In the first stage of weight development, an expansion weight (the inverse of the selection 
probability) that depended on child gender and the number of eligible children in a household was 
computed for each subject. In the second stage of weight development, 12 weighting classes were 
formed based on factors where significant differential response was noted, which included race, 
lunch subsidy status, and special education service status. 47(chap7,pp190-211) To adjust for differential 
response rates, the expansion weight was divided by the response rate within each weighting class 
to form a response-adjusted weight. In the third stage of weight development, a relative weight was 
constructed by dividing each response-adjusted weight by the mean response-adjusted weight. This 
scaling step effectively downweighted the number of subjects to equal the actual sample size. The 
final weight was obtained after trimming the extreme (lower 1% and upper 99%) values of the rel- 
ative weights and uniformly redistributing the values so that the actual sample size was preserved. 
Participants in the follow-up interviews differed from those who declined to participate only by 
the SNAP-IV scores of oppositional defiant behavior, with participants showing higher scores than 
nonparticipants. The analytic weights used for the barrier analyses were calculated by a poststrat- 
ification adjustment of the initial screening sample weights based on the observed distribution of 
the oppositional defiant behavior scores for initial and follow-up interview participants. Parameter 
estimates and subgroup totals reported in this article are weighted to more appropriately represent 
the target population. 



Bivariate analysis was conducted using a chi-square test of proportions for discrete variables. To 
examine the independent contribution of hypothesized predictor variables on the likelihood of help- 
seeking steps for ADHD symptoms, 4 multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. The 
variables included predisposing sociodemographic factors, enabling variables, and need. Logistic 
regression models were also used to identify predictors, namely, gender, ethnicity, SES, and lunch 
status, of particular barrier categories. CoUinearity of these predictors was examined using kappa 
analysis and found not to be a problem, with kappa estimates in the slight to moderate range (.05- 
.42). 48 The statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 6, and STATA. 49 


The high-risk sample was composed of equal proportions of boys ( N = 202, 52%) and girls 
(N= 187, 48%), and of Caucasian ( N = 188, 48%) and African American (N=201, 52%) chil- 
dren. The average child age was 7.8 years (SD = 1.8) and the mean SES score was 32.7 (SD = 13.8). 
Nearly three quarters of the children ( N = 288; 74%) qualified for subsidized school lunches, an 
indicator of poverty. Most youth (N= 342, 88%) had some type of health insurance and almost all 
children (N= 368, 95%) had a source of routine pediatric care. Routine care was most commonly 
provided in private office settings (N = 226, 58%) followed by clinics or public health departments 
(N= 142, 37%). Slightly more than one quarter of the children received special education ser- 
vices for specific learning disabilities or emotional handicaps ( N = 66, 17%) or other conditions 
(N = 34, 9%). 

Table 1 summarizes the distribution of the 4 help-seeking steps by sociodemographic characteris- 
tics, and enabling and need factors. Of the 389 high-risk children, 88% (N = 341) had been recognized 
by their parents as having problems. The recognition rates varied by gender, race, behavior problem 
severity, and special education status. More pronounced variations and a larger number of potential 
predictors emerged for evaluation rates. Overall, only 39% of the high-risk children (N = 152) had 
received a professional evaluation. The lowest evaluation rates (10%) were reported for children 
without a routine source of pediatric care, compared to 45% for children with a private source and 
34% for those with other sources (P < .01). Evaluation rates were also significantly lower for girls 
compared to boys (20% versus 57%; P < .001). In addition, the evaluation rates varied by all other 
potential predictors except health insurance status and teacher-reported problem behavior severity. 
Almost one third (N = 123, 32%) of the original high-risk sample had received an ADHD diagnosis. 
Diagnosis rates varied most strongly by gender, race, and the source of routine pediatric care, but all 
predictor variables except for teacher-reported behavior problem severity were significantly related. 
Less than one quarter ( N = 89, 23%) of the high-risk sample was currently receiving ADHD treat- 
ment. The lowest treatment rates were reported for children without a routine source of pediatric 
care (5%), compared to 27% for children with a private source and 18% for those with other sources 
(P < .05) and for girls (9%), compared to 35% among boys (P < .001). 

The independent relationships between help-seeking steps and sociodemographic characteristics, 
services received in primary care and special education, and behavior problem severity are summa- 
rized in Table 2. Problem recognition increased with child age and behavior problem severity. While 
gender and race did not independently affect recognition rates, both variables had consistent and large 
effects on subsequent help-seeking steps. Boys had over 5 times the odds of girls, and Caucasian

A D H D treatment was higher for nonpoor children than for their impoverished peers as well as for chil- 
dren receiving special education services compared to students receiving regular or gifted education 
services. 

Fifty-six percent of the unserved children with A D H D ( N = 91) were boys, 50% were African 
American, and 70% received subsidized school lunch. Their average age was 7.6 years (SD = 1.9) 
and the mean SES score was 33 (SD = 14.9). The parents reported an average of 4.1 (SD = 2.5) 
overall barriers to care. The total number of barriers did not vary by gender, race, or lunch status. 
The 3 most commonly endorsed items were being unsure where to go for help ( N = 35; 39%), the 
problem got better by itself (iV= 33; 36%), and the child got well enough that s/he did not need treat- 
ment anymore ( N = 31; 34%). The most common barrier category was no perceived need ( N = 60; 
66%), followed by system barriers (N = 48; 53%) and negative expectations (N = 41; 45%). Similar 
proportions o f parents reported stigma-related ( N = 36; 39%) or financial barriers ( N = 34; 38%). 
Table 3 summarizes the relationship between barrier types and sociodemographic characteristics. 
Parents of girls reported more stigma-related barriers than did those of boys, and African Ameri- 
can parents expressed more negative expectations than did their Caucasian peers. Poverty affected 
all barrier categories except system ones, and low SES families were more likely than their more

advantaged counterparts to report financial barriers. The sole multivariate logistic regression model 
to reach statistical significance was for the prediction of negative expectations (X 2 = 12.6, DF-4, 
P < .01), where lunch status emerged as an independent predictor such that poverty increased the 
odds of negative expectations (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.7-27.8). 

Findings from this study suggest that parental recognition of a potential behavior problem among 
a group of elementary school students at high risk for ADHD was relatively high, and that regardless 
of gender or ethnicity, child age and clinical severity increased the likelihood of problem recognition. 
The former is not surprising, because the behaviors associated with ADHD are easily observable 
and tend to have disruptive effects on child and parent interaction. The latter findings have also been 
reported among clinical populations, 24,5Â° and are consistent with the neurodevelopmental nature 
of ADHD. Activities listed as diagnostic target behaviors are often considered normal in younger 
children, and children of all ages may show isolated ADHD symptoms on some occasions. 4Â° Pro- 
fessionals therefore evaluate the age-appropriateness, frequency, and severity of ADHD symptoms 
when making a diagnosis, 51 and our study findings suggest that parents form their concerns in a 
similar fashion. 
A substantial gap was found between problem recognition and seeking an evaluation for ADHD 
symptoms. Controlling for enabling and need variables, boys or Caucasian children were much more 
likely to receive an ADHD evaluation than were girls or African American children, respectively. 
Further study examining the mechanisms underlying gender and ethnic disparities for ADHD care is 



merited. Qualitative research methods in particular may be useful in eliciting reasons why concerned 
parents do not seek an evaluation and how this might vary for parents of girls and those from 
minority backgrounds. 52-s4 Of note, the predictors of recognition did not exert an influence on 
seeking an evaluation. Instead, having a regular source of routine pediatric care increased a child's 
odds of receiving an ADHD assessment 6-fold. Although the function of pediatricians as gatekeepers 
for mental health services has been clearly demonstrated, 24 their importance is magnified among 
children with ADHD, because primary care providers render the majority of ADHD assessments and 
treatments in the United States. 12'55'56 These results also are consistent with those by Wilson et al, 
who reported that adolescents using the emergency room for usual care were found to have increased 
unmet mental health needs. 3Â° These findings therefore suggest that access to ADHD evaluations may 
be increased by improving access to routine pediatric care. 
Unlike the first 2 help-seeking steps, assignment of a diagnosis is strongly dependent on the 
providers conducting the assessment, even though parents play a significant role in the diagnostic 
process by way of providing descriptions of the child's behaviors, concerns, and in some cases, of- 
feting a suspected diagnosis. 51'52'56 The assignment of a professional ADHD diagnosis was strongly 
predicted by child gender, ethnicity, and parent-reported symptom severity. While the former 2 pre- 
dictors raise questions about gender and race bias during the diagnostic process at the provider 
level, the latter one is consistent with recommended assessment guidelines. 5~'56 Previous studies of 
community, primary care, and Medicaid samples suggest a 3 to 1 ratio of boys to girls in assigning 
ADHD diagnoses, 6"57'58 but do not show consistent ethnic differences. This is the only help-seeking 
step for which poverty status emerged as a predictor, with nonpoor children having nearly 3 times the 
odds of receiving treatment than their impoverished peers, even after adjusting for health insurance 
status. This finding is consistent with other studies reporting lower mental health treatment rates 
among youth from low-income backgrounds. 23'26'59 Further, child receipt of special education ser- 
vices nearly tripled the odds that parents will secure ADHD treatment. In this cross-sectional study 
it is hard to draw conclusions from this finding. Parents may have sought an ADHD evaluation and 
diagnosis so that their child could qualify for certain special education services. 6Â° On the other hand, 
greater willingness to seek services among these parents may be prompted by factors such as the 
potentially greater functional impairment of ADHD children with comorbid learning problems, or 
by special education teacher advice to seek ADHD treatment) Â°'3s'61 
The barriers to care analysis provided additional insight into why parents of children with ADHD 
may not pursue treatment for their child. Most noteworthy, over two thirds of parents indicated 
that they did not see a need for professional treatment even though these children had met full 
DSM-IV ADHD criteria at the time of the interview. This may reflect a threshold adjustment where 
abnormal child behavior is perceived as "normal" for the given child, 62 or may represent a lack 
of understanding of the nature and course of ADHD. It also may indicate that the parents have an 
alternative "explanatory model" of their child's behavior and do not see it as a medical issue, s3 Such 
findings underscore the necessity to better understand parental perceptions of need for professional 
services for their children. System barriers were the next common reason for not seeking help, with 
being unsure where to go for help as the leading item. Even if the desire for mental health treatment 
is brought to the attention of pediatricians, significant barriers may remain according to a study by 
Hoagwood and colleagues, indicating that lack of specialists, difficulty getting appointments, and 
nonacceptance of Medicaid were major barriers to mental health services for pediatric patients with 
identified need. 63 
African American parents had higher rates of negative treatment expectations than did Caucasians. 
This may be a reflection on the established racial disparities in quality of care, including mental health 
treatment. 64,65 African American parents who have concerns about their child's behavior may not 
seek treatment because they do not perceive professionals as trustworthy allies. African American 
families embody certain beliefs and practices about behavioral and mental disorders that influence 



their help-seeking behaviors, their responses to the available services, and methods of coping. These 
factors are not clearly understood. Previous studies have shown, however, that African American 
parents' interpretation and explanatory models of ADHD differ from those of Caucasians, such that 
while they may see the child as difficult to manage, they are less likely to view it as a medical 
problem. 39'53 Limited income and the stressors of poverty are other major forces that negatively 
impact African American families' capacities to seek adequate treatment for their children. Against 
this backdrop, African American families are orientated toward learning to triumph over adversity, 
and "soldier onward" through increased striving and perseverance rather than through reliance on 
professional help. 
Several additional study limitations should be taken into account when interpreting the study 
results. Since cross-sectional data were used to explore the help-seeking process, the time course 
between the help-seeking steps cannot be established. This design also precludes examining concep- 
tually important malleable enabling factors, such as parental ADHD knowledge, because these may 
have been influenced by prior service u s e . 39 The treatment inquiry focused on current intervention 
and did not include care received in the past, thus representing more recently started treatment or 
children who had received persistent treatment. In addition, as the focus of this study was on parental 
help-seeking efforts for high-risk children, the validity of assigned professional ADHD diagnoses 
was not addressed. Parent reports of service use were not validated by provider or insurance records; 
however, good agreement between parent report and medical records for outpatient services has been 
reported in other studies. 66 Further, the study was conducted in 1 school district in a Southeastern 
state, potentially limiting the data's generalizability to other geographic areas. 

Study findings suggest that ADHD undertreatment for girls and African American children may 
be linked to the gap between parental problem recognition and seeking an evaluation. Thus, it is 
hypothesized that 2 thresholds have to be crossed before children at high risk for ADHD receive 
professional help. The first one is labeling behavior as problematic 62'67 and the second one is for 
seeking professional intervention. Weisz and colleagues 62,67 have shown that the former varies in 
cross-cultural studies, but the latter concept, a threshold for seeking services, has not yet been 
explicated in the literature. If confirmed in other studies, such a threshold has important implications 
for interventions aimed at making access to ADHD treatment more equitable for affected girls 
and African American children. Since nearly all parents of high-risk children detected a concern, 
intervention efforts do not need to focus on improving parental problem recognition skills. Rather, 
research efforts should be directed toward unraveling the reason for the gender and race/ethnicity 
variations in the threshold that determines whether a parent seeks professional services. Such research 
should specifically examine whether parents see child behavior problems, such as hyperactivity or 
inattention, as something they think can be helped through medical intervention. Future studies 
should also explore whether the substitution of self-care or alternative care strategies plays a role in 
threshold variations. 68,69 In querying parents about their experiences of treatment barriers, this study 
suggests higher rates of perceived stigma for treatment of daughters than of sons, and more negative 
treatment expectations among African American compared to Caucasian families. However, these 
findings were not of sufficient magnitude to explain the significantly lower rates of treatment for 
ADHD care among girls and African American children. No other barrier sources emerged that 
would explain the disparate help-seeking thresholds. Therefore, before specific interventions can 
be designed to increase the odds of parents seeking professional ADHD services for their affected 
daughters and African American children, qualitative studies examining the mechanisms for the 
dissimilar thresholds are merited.
