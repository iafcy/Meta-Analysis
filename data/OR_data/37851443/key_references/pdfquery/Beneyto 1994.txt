A 2-stage survey was carried out to establish the point-prevalence of 
mental disorders and help-seeking behaviour in children aged 8, 11 and 15 
living in the city of Valencia. Global prevalence rates, rates by age and 
rates by sex, as well as rates of specific diagnosis according to DSM-111-R 
criteria are described. Help-seeking behaviour was found to be related to 
an interaction between internalizing and externalizing symptoms and sex. 
Key words: epidemiology; childhood: mental 
disorder

Since the first studies carried out in the 1950s in the 
United States, data on the prevalence of mental dis- 
orders among children all over the world have been 
accumulating. Based on data published before 1980, 
Gould (1) estimated the prevalence rate of mental 
disorders in the United States at a maximum of 
11.8 % and Brandenburg (2), who reviewed all works 
published after 1980, estimated that the prevalence 
would be between 14 and 20%. 
Despite the fact that some of the most important 
prevalence studies on childhood mental disorders in 
Europe were conducted more than 25 years ago (3), 
there is no information available on the prevalence 
of such disorders in Spain. The preservation of fam- 
ily life in Spain as compared with other western 
countries may be a relevant variable in the study of 
prevalence and/or the parent’s help-seeking behav- 
iour and therefore deserves special attention. 
The aim of this study was to establish the point- 
prevalence of mental disorders and pattern of mor- 
bidity as well as use of professional services in the 
city of Valencia among 8-, 11- and 15-year-old chil- 
dren. The study was carried out according to a 
2-stage design. In the first stage, the Child Behaviour 
Checklist (4) was employed as a screening instru- 
ment and in the second the Schedule for Affective 
Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) ( 5 ) and the 
Global Assessment Functioning Scale (6). In the 
second stage parents were also given a questionnaire 
enquiring about the presence of chronic somatic dis- 
eases and impairments in their children. Finally, a 
brief interview on the use of professional services 
was conducted. 


Valencia is situated on the east coast of Spain. With 
738,575 inhabitants, it is the country’s third largest 
city. At the time of the study, approximately 60% of 
the population was employed in the service sector 
and 35% worked in industry and less than 5% in 
agriculture. The unemployment rate stood at ap- 
proximately 18 % at the time of the survey. Valencia 
has the seventh highest level of G N P among Spanish 
regions. 

The sample frame for this study was the municipal 
census, and the sampling unit was the individual 
child included in 1 of 3 age groups. 
A sample of 1200 children was selected by simple 
random sampling, with a fixed number of 400 per age 
group (8, 11 and 15 years old). Another random 
sample was taken with identical characteristics to 
provide replacements as necessary. 
In order to identify probable psychiatric cases, the 
Spanish version of the Child Behavior Checklist 
(CBCL) (7), whose psychometric characteristics 
have been described by Puche (7), was used. Puche 
found that a cut-off point of 3 1 successfully discrimi- 
nated between clinical and nonclinical cases, with a 
sensitivity of 0.88, a specificity of 0.88 and a mis- 
classification rate of 13 % . The original version of the 
questionnaire was designed to be self-administered 
by the parents, but Puche found in a sample of 
Spanish mothers that test-retest reliability increased 
considerably if the questionnaire was administered 
to the parents by a third person. Because of this, the 
CBCL was administered to the parents in the course 
of an interview. The interviews were carried out by 
final-year students from the Valencia University 
School of Social Work who had previously been 
trained in handling the CBCL. Although the plan 
was to interview both parents at home, in the ma- 
jority of cases it was only possible to obtain infor- 
mation from the mothers. 
Children who refused to collaborate or could not 
be located were replaced. Replacements were made 
maintaining the same characteristics of age, sex and 
socioeconomic level of area of residence. 

Once the first stage was completed, a reduced sample 
of children was selected for the diagnostic explora- 
tion corresponding to the second stage. This sub- 
sample consisted of a percentage of children chosen 
randomly from score intervals in the CBCL, per- 
centages that were larger the higher the score: ap- 
proximately 10% of those who scored lower than 20; 
25% of those who scored between 21 and 30; and 
90% of those who scored over 30. 
As in the first stage of the study, the children who 
could not be interviewed were replaced by others 
with the same characteristics of age, sex and socio- 
economic level in the area of residence, adding to 
this stage the requirement that they had a similar 
score on the CBCL ( k 5 points). 
For case identification and diagnosis according to 
DSM-111-R criteria, the semistructured K-SADS in- 
terview ( 5 ) was used, adapted to Spanish (8). The 
interviewers taking part in the second stage of the 
study were 4 trained pediatric psychiatrists. They 
were trained in the usage of the K-SADS interview, 
until an agreement index over 90% was reached 
in a sample of 36 children. In order to detect and 
exclude from the final prevalence estimate children 
with lower than normal intellectual performance 
levels, the Progressive Matrices was used (9). 
The children placed below the 25th percentile 
were excluded if, at the same time, they showed 
clinical or social signs of general developmental dis- 
turbance. 
The interview almost always took place in the 
child’s home, although on occasions it was con- 
ducted in hospital. Generally, the interview was con- 
ducted first with the child and subsequently with the 
mother, alone with the interviewer on both occa- 
sions. 
The length of the interviews ranged from 40-50 
min in straightforward cases to 105 min in the most 
difficult cases. In almost all the interviews, both the 
child and the parents were seen; however, in a small 

number of lSyear-olds, the interview took place with 
them alone at their request. 
A measure of impairment was obtained by scor- 
ing 5 areas of daily life (family life, social relation- 
ships at school, social relationships outside school, 
leisure activities and school performance) on a 
4-point severity scale (none, slight, moderate and 
severe). 
Following the psychiatric examination, the pres- 
ence of somatic diseases and impairments as per- 
ceived by the parents was explored by means of a 
checklist. Parents were also asked to measure the 
degree of disability and the degree of distress asso- 
ciated to each of the identified somatic complaints, 
on a 3-point severity scale (none, moderate or 
severe). 
Finally, help-seeking behaviour was investigated. 
Consultation with private or public professional ser- 
vices for mental reasons was registered, as well as 
consultation dates, and the type and duration of 
treatment. 

Mental disorders were considered to be present for 
the children who received at least one diagnosis on 
Axis 1 according to DSM-111-R criteria; their degree 
of severity was measured by the Global Assessment 
of Functioning score (6): 100-71: minimally im- 
paired; 70-61: mildly impaired; 60-5 1: moderately 
impaired and under 5 1, severely impaired. 

Of the original sample of 1200 children, 348 could 
not be interviewed: 85 (7%) refused to collaborate, 
70 (6%) were not located and 193 (17%) corre- 
sponded to census errors. Of the 348 not interviewed 
it was possible to provide 275 replacements equiva- 
lent in sex, age and socioeconomic level of area of 
residence, who were interviewed, which left 73 cases 
without possibility of replacement, and due to which 
the final sample interviewed was reduced from 1200 
to 1127. 
During the second stage of the study there were 
23 (7 %) refusals, of which it was possible to replace 
18 with children of the same age, sex, socioeconomic

level of area of residence and score in the CBCL 
questionnaire, as the refusals. In Table 1 the samples 
finally interviewed in the first and second stages are 
shown. 
Table 2 shows the distribution of children in the 
first and second stages of the study in accordance 
with their scores in the CBCL. In the first stage of 
the study, 19% of the children obtained a score of 
over 30 points in the CBCL and 5 % exceeded a 
score of 40. 
Once the second stage was concluded, 11 children 
were found to have scored less than 25% in the 
Raven Matrices, along with signs of general devel- 
opmental disturbance and so were not included in 
the final analysis. Three of them fulfilled mental dis- 
order criteria, with the following diagnoses: enuresis, 
overanxious disorder and oppositional disorder. 

Of 320 children examined in the second stage, 114 
met case definition criteria. The global weighted 
point-prevalence rate was 21.7% 2.6, but if chil- 
dren with minimal and mild disorders were excluded, 
the rate would come down to 4.4% t 1.2 (Table 3). 
Boys presented higher rates than girls in all 3 levels 
of impairment, the ratio of boys/girls being 1.2, 1.2 
and 1.7; however, marked differences emerged when 
these rates were broken down into age groups: at age 
8, boys presented considerably higher rates than girls 
across the 3 levels of impairment, whereas the in- 
verse pattern was seen in 15-year-olds (Table 4). 
Table 5 shows the estimated prevalence rates of 
specific diagnosis adjusted for age. Rates of exter- 
nalizing disorders (disturbed behaviour, attention 
deficit, elimination and tic disorders) tend to dimin- 
ish with age, whereas rates of internalizing disorders 
(overanxiety, mood, sleep and phobic disorders) tend 
to increase. Boys were prevalent over girls in all 
diagnoses for ages 8 and 11, except for simple pho- 
bias and separation anxiety, which were commoner 
in girls. On the other hand, girls’ rates were higher 
at age 15 in all disorders except tics and overanxious 
disorder. The size of the sample does not allow for 
the calculation of rates of diagnosis specific to age 
and sex. 
Sixty-eight percent of the children had received 
one diagnosis, 23% 2 diagnoses and the rest 3 or 
more diagnoses. The number of diagnoses per child 
was 1.7 at 8, 1.6 at 11 and 1.8 at 15. The most 
common diagnostic association at 8 was attention 
deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with tic or 
elimination disorder, whereas in older children the 
association of ADHD with oppositional disorder 
was commoner at 11 and of oppositional disorder 
and overanxiety at 15. 
Help-seeking 
Forty-nine children classified as cases (43 %) had 
sought professional help at least once in their lives 
for mental reasons, other than learning disorders, 
but only 18 (16%) were currently in contact, 14 
(78%) with the national health service and 4 with 
private practitioners. Five children were visiting their 
paediatrician, 5 were visiting a psychologist and 8 a 
psychiatrist. On the other hand, 3 children who were

not considered to be clinical cases but who were 
having serious relationship problems were receiving 
treatment. Children who were seen by psychiatrists 
had significantly higher GAF scores than children 
who were seen by either the psychologists or paedi- 
atricians ( F = 5.72; P = 0.014). 
The majority of children who had been in touch 
with professional services in the past (25/3 1) and 
half of those who were receiving help at present (9/9) 
had contacted less than 5 times altogether.Fifty chil- 
dren were classified by their parents as suffering from 
a chronic somatic ailment, but only 35 were thought 
to be moderately to severely disabled in their daily 
lives and 10 were thought to be significantly dis- 
tressed. The most frequent complaints were: ortho- 
paedic (8 cases), specific allergies (8 cases), visual 
(7), vascular headache ( 5 cases), epilepsy (3 cases) 
and diabetes (3 cases). No significant association 
was found between somatic complaints and mental 
status, nor between somatic complaints and help- 
seeking behaviour for mental reasons. 


children classified as clinical cases had not sought 
professional help, a multiple logistic regression model 
was run, with age, sex, GAF scores, CBCL scores 
(factor scores on internalizing and externalizing be- 
haviours) and impairment scores (family relation- 
ships, social relationships outside school, social re- 
lationships at school and leisure activities) as 
independent variables and consultation status as the 
dependent variable. The best fit is shown in Table 6. 
Being a boy is significantly associated with consul- 
tation. There is also a significant interaction of CBCL 
scores with sex: children who consult present higher 
scores in internalizing behaviour, particularly boys. 
Externalizing scores are associated with consulta- 
tion in girls, whereas in boys they play against the 
probability of consultation (Table 7). 
Once the investigation was finished, the parents of 
children with a GAF score under 5 1 were contacted 
and offered psychiatric treatment. Only 1 of 19 
accepted. 

Brandenburg (2) reviewed 8 surveys carried out in 
the last decade, reporting a range of prevalence rates 
from 14% to 20%. Compared with these, the rates 
presented here are very low. The discrepancy is un- 
likely to be caused by methodological differences 
since in more than half of the surveys reviewed by 
Brandenburg, the diagnostic instruments and case 
definition criteria are the same or very similar to 
those used in this study. One the other hand, the 
differences are too large to be accounted for by the 
differing sample sizes and standard errors. 
The point prevalence reported in this study is 
bound to be lower than the period prevalence re- 
ported in some studies, but this is not enough to 
justify such a large difference in rates, since the most 
prevalent disorders described here (ADHD, elimi- 
nation and disturbed behaviour disorder) tend to 
last for several years, and therefore the probabilities 
to be picked up in surveys of period or point preva- 
lence are very similar. 
Perhaps the difference in rates can be explained by 
a different interpretation of the degrees of impair- 
ment adopted in this survey and this in turn may be 
linked to cultural differences between countries: an 
attitude of greater sensitivity towards children’s suf-

fering in one country or greater tolerance towards 
certain difficult behaviours in the other. 
On the other hand, some countries may have a 
more developed system of psychiatric services for 
children than Spain, and it seems logical that the 
more developed the services, the more likely it is that 
high rates of cases needing psychiatric treatment are 
to be found. Nevertheless, once again it should be 
stressed that we are trying to explain a 4-fold differ- 
ence in rates and this difference is large enough to 
consider that the possibility of there being real dif- 
ferences in the prevalence of severe disorders be- 
tween Spain and the rest of the surveyed countries 
cannot be discounted. This low rate is in accordance 
with other low rates found for various psychosocial 
problems in Valencia, such as suicides (lo), at- 
tempted suicides (1 1) and treated prevalence rates of 
adult mental disorders (12) registered in this city. 
The consistency of these findings backs up the hypo- 
thesis of a true lower rate of psychosocial problems 
in Valencia, including the prevalence rates of child 
psychiatric patients, which may deserve further re- 
search efforts. 
Most of the estimations of rates adjusted to age, 
sex and GAF scores have very large standard errors, 
but nevertheless a few general comments can be 
made with confidence. A large part of the global 
prevalence rate can be accounted for by disorders in 
8 year-old boys. These are of mild severity, mostly 
elimination and ADHD disorders, which tend to 
diminish with increasing age. It could be that chil- 
dren at this age respond to stress with visible symp- 
toms, such as enuresis, tics or hyperactivity, whereas 
older children more often respond with mood and 
anxiety symptoms that may pass unnoticed by the 
parents and thus go unreported at interviews. 
In general, boys’ rates tend to diminish with age, 
just the opposite of girls’, so that by age 15 girls have 
outnumbered boys in all degrees of impairment. The 
distribution of rates by age reported previously cov- 
ers all possibilities: Verhulst (13) found a higher 
prevalence rate for 8 year olds, while Offord (14) 
found similar rates for all ages, and Laucht (15) 
reported rates in 13 year-olds higher than rates in 
8-year-olds. 
The sample studied is too small to estimate the 
prevalence rates for specific diagnoses with any de- 
gree of confidence and this is reflected in the large 
standard errors reported. Furthermore, using a single 
screening test may not be the best way to obtain a 
fair representation of all diagnostic disorders in the 
second stage. Therefore, the rates quoted here should 
be interpreted as a description of the morbidity pat- 
tern rather than taking them as reliable rates of spe- 
cific diagnoses. 
With regard to this pattern, disruptive behavior 
disorder is the most frequent diagnosis for all ages, 
followed by anxiety disorders, and this is in keeping 
with the findings of other published reports (13, 16- 
18). However, significant rates of elimination, tic 
and sleep disorders have never been reported in pre- 
vious studies. This may result from either having 
considered these disorders secondary to other diag- 
noses and therefore not worthy of comment or, al- 
ternatively, these disorders may have been found to 
have no repercussion in the life of the child and for 
this reason have been disregarded as a constituent 
of mental disorder. This is not the case in the present 
survey. In the majority of presentations (82%) the 
disorder present was related to another disorder, 
generally the most frequent one in the correspond- 
ing age and sex group. In 18% of the presentations 
the disorder was monosymptomatic but of sufficient 
severity to warrant specialized treatment according 
to the interviewing psychiatrists. It could also be that 
these disorders run a more prolonged course than 
mood disorders and so are more likely to be detected 
in a point-prevalence study like this one. 
Separation anxiety, ADDH and elimination dis- 
orders tend to diminish with increasing age, whereas 
oppositional, overanxious and mood disorders tend 
to increase. This is in keeping with a maturational 
point of view of child psychopathology. 
The most frequent diagnostic association found 
was between ADHD and oppositional disorder, 
which is in agreement with previous reports (16, 18, 
19). This association is claimed to be especially fre- 
quent in boys, but in this survey the combined fre- 
quency was similar in both sexes. Kashani (19), 
Anderson (18) and others have reported a relation- 
ship between mood and disruptive disorders which 
has not been confirmed in this study, perhaps due to 
the very few cases of depression identified. 
In spite of a fairly well developed public network 
of child psychiatric assistance, only 16% of children 
classified as having a mental disorder were under 
treatment, and then half of them had made less than 
5 visits altogether. These facts are all the more dis- 
turbing if we consider that almost all parents of se- 
verely ill children who were offered help did not 
accept it. 
Nevertheless, reported service utilization rates are 
generally low. Thus, Anderson (18) found that 29% 
of 1 1-year-old children suffering from a confirmed 
mental disorder were referred to specialized services, 
and in Rutter’s Isle of Wight study only 1 in 6 chil- 
dren found to be in need of treatment were actually 
receiving it. Contrary to expectations, in this study 
there was an absence of unjustified help-seeking be- 
haviour; this is in contrast to previous surveys where 
a substantial percentage of normal children were 
reported to have contacted specialized services not 
because of their mental state but because of their 
mother’s (2 1). 
In this survey, children who sought help and who 
were found to be normal on Axis I suffered from 
Code V problems, which explained their being under 
treatment. On the other hand, a very high percent- 
age of mentally normal children were receiving psy- 
chological help at their school because of Axis I1 
learning disorders, but these children have not been 
considered to be in treatment. Perhaps parental 
anxieties here find indirect relief through the school 
psychological services, and this may explain the lack 
of unjustified help-seeking behaviour found in this 
survey. 
A significant association was found between being 
a boy and having consulted within the last 6 months, 
which is in keeping with previous findings. However, 
the interaction between sex and internalizing CBCL 
score has not been reported before. One possible 
explanation is that externalizing behaviour (hyper- 
activity, aggressiveness and impulsiveness) is better 
tolerated in boys than in girls because it is thought 
to be more compatible with the male role, whereas 
the opposite applies to internalizing behaviour. This 
may well be a sexist culturally dependent pattern of 
help-seeking behaviour. 
Approximately 10% of children from the second- 
stage sample were reported to suffer from a somatic 
problem of moderate to severe degree. It is interest- 
ing to note the lack of association between distress 
and/or impairment caused by chronic somatic com- 
plaints on the one hand and mental status and help- 
seeking behaviour on the other. This is at variance 
with the findings reported in adult psychiatry, where 
mental and somatic complaints and help-seeking be- 
haviour go together, and it may be explained by the 
less distressing impact that somatic disease may have 
on children’ life. 
Unfortunately, the analysis of the available data 
did not help to reveal why some parents of severely 
ill children did not seek 
consultation. It is likely that other factors related 
to parents’ attitudes that were not taped in this in- 
vestigation play an important role in parents’ help- 
seeking behaviour (22). 
One of the aims of prevalence surveys is to iden- 
tify and treat people found to be suffering from a 
disorder. However, this is the first time that, in a 
reported psychiatric survey of children, treatment is 
offered to the parents of children with severe disor- 
ders. The negative parental response casts a doubt 
on the utility of prevalence surveys for this aim;
