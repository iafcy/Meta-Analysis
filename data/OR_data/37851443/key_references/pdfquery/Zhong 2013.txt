Background: To date, no one-phase survey of childhood depression has been per- 
formed in China that involves both urban and rural community children. The 
objective of this study was to determine the prevalence, correlates, and mental 
health service utilization of depressive disorders (DDs) in a community-based 
sample of 6–14-year-old children in south-central China. Methods: Children 
(3,582) were approached through multistage sampling and interviewed using a 
Chinese version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Chil- 
dren and Adolescents 5.0, which is a structured interview that is administered by 
trained psychiatrists to obtain information from children and their guardians. 
Results: The overall prevalence of all current DDs was found to be 2.8% (95%CI: 
1.5–3.9). The risk factors for depression included being 9–14-year old, not at- 
tending school, having unmarried parents, living in a nonnuclear family (single 
parent or parentless family), being taken care of by people other than two par- 
ents (single parent, grandparent(s), other relatives, or others) during the past 
year, and not being breastfed prior to 1 year of age. Only 5.8% of the depressed 
children had received professional help prior to the interview. Conclusions: The 
prevalence of DDs among children in this part of China is relatively high com- 
pared with most ﬁgures reported in other countries. Depression in this age group 
has been a major public health concern, but it is often underrecognized. There is

INTRODUCTION 
Depression is currently the second leading cause of 
disability, and it is predicted that it will be the highest 
medically related cause of death and disability worldwide 
by 2030.[1] Several studies have revealed that depres- 
sive symptoms are among the most common psychiatric 
health complaints in children and adolescents in China[2] 
and western countries.[3] The presence of depression 
in childhood signiﬁcantly increases the risk of comor- 
bid psychiatric illnesses[4] and physical disorders.[5] Fur- 
thermore, both retrospective and prospective studies 
have shown that the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statis- 
tical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) di- 
agnoses of anxiety, mood, and multiple substance use 
disorders in adulthood are signiﬁcantly predicted by 
childhood depression.[6–8] Depression negatively im- 
pacts children’s growth and development, school per- 
formance, and peer or family relationships, and it may 
lead to suicide.[9] The negative ways in which children 
are affected by depression highlight the importance of 
gaining an understanding of the magnitude, risk factors, 
and mental health service utilization of depressive dis- 
orders (DDs) in children and adolescents. However, in 
contrast to the numerous epidemiological studies of DDs 
in adults, the epidemiology of DDs in children has re- 
ceived less research attention, especially in China. 
Although epidemiological estimates on the preva- 
lence rates of DDs vary depending on the investiga- 
tion method, informant report, standardized assessment 
measure, and diagnostic criteria used,[10] results from 
prevalence studies indicate that childhood DDs are not 
rare.[11] Dysthymic disorder (DYD) has a current preva- 
lence of 0.6–1.7% in prepubertal children and 1.6–8% 
in adolescents.[12] The past-year prevalence rates from 
previous studies showed a median prevalence estimate 
of 4.0%, with a range of 0.1–8% for major depressive 
disorder (MDD).[13–15] Costello et al. performed a meta- 
analysis of 26 studies and found that the current preva- 
lence rates of DDs were 2.8% for children under 13 
years of age and 5.6% for 14–18-year-old.[16] In terms 
of lifetime prevalence, rates as high as 25% by the end 
of adolescence have been reported.[4] 
It is thought that socio-cultural factors play an im- 
portant role in the occurrence of mental disorders. To- 
day, Chinese children and adolescents are facing more 
tremendous socioeconomic transformations than their 
predecessors. Due to the competitive education sys- 
tem and high parental expectations of academic perfor- 
mance, Chinese students are suffering from high levels 
of academic stress associated with high school and uni- 

versity entrance examinations.[17, 18] Shifting socioeco- 
nomic structures have also led to profound changes in 
the organization of family life. In rural China, due to 
urbanization, an enormous number of rural laborers are 
continually migrating to cities in search of better job 
opportunities. Among these laborers, most of the young 
parents have to leave their children behind for ﬁnancial 
reasons. Thus, millions of children are remained in the 
rural communities and taken care of by single parents, 
grandparents, other relatives, or themselves.[19] Liu et al. 
found that the children who were left at home and sep- 
arated from their parents at a younger age had more 
depressive symptoms.[19] It is expected that the preva- 
lence of DDs would increase in the context of China’s 
urbanization. 
Sample selection is one of the most important factors 
affecting prevalence. Two-phase studies in schoolchil- 
dren, which have the advantages of good sampling efﬁ- 
ciency and low cost, are very popular in prevalence es- 
timation of child and adolescent mental disorders.[20] 
These studies[21–34] ﬁrstly screened a large sample of 
schoolchildren with a short depression screening scale 
and then selected a subsample for a more in-depth stan- 
dardized diagnostic interview. While it should be noted 
that these school-based surveys could potentially lead to 
a selection bias,[35] as those have mental disorders, i.e. 
schizophrenia and MDD, are more likely to discontinue 
their schooling, thus could not be sampled.[36, 37] Child- 
hood depression surveys in communities[38–42] showed 
relatively higher prevalence rates than surveys in schools 
(community children: range = 0.0–4.9%, median = 
1.4%, mean = 1.7%; school children: range = 0.0–4.8%, 
median = 1.2%, mean = 1.3%). As a consequence, exist- 
ing school-based studies might underestimate the preva- 
lence of DDs in children. Along with the representa- 
tiveness of the sample, these two-phase studies have also 
been criticized for a loss of precision in the prevalence 
estimation.[43] To the best of our knowledge, only 4 two- 
phase studies[23–26] that both use stringent methods and 
are published in local journals have assessed the preva- 
lence of childhood depression in urban schoolchildren 
of mainland China. A well-designed study of the preva- 
lence of childhood DDs in a representative community- 
dwelling sample in China is lacking. 
The current study was carried out to (1) provide preva- 
lence estimates of DDs among children living in urban 
and rural communities of Wuhan, China; (2) identify 
risk factors of childhood DDs; and (3) investigate the 
mental health service use of children with DDs. This 
study was part of a large-scale epidemiological survey 


of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the popula- 
tion aged ≥6 years in Wuhan, China. Because subjects 
aged ≥15 years were categorized into the adult sample 
and interviewed using an adult mental disorder assess- 
ment tool, the present study only reported the results of 
children aged 6–14 years. 


This survey was conducted in Wuhan, which is a large metropolitan 
city in south-central China and is the capital of Hubei province. It has 
a population of approximately 10,020,000 people, and approximately 
63.1 and 36.9% residents live in its urban and rural areas, respectively. 
Like other major cities in China, it is characterized by rapid economic 
growth and urbanization, with the portion of the urban population 
growing from 38.1% in 1980 to 65.6% in 2010.[44] For several years, 
it has been ranked number 12 in the top 50 cities of China for com- 
prehensive economic strength. According to the ofﬁcial reports, it is 
also one of the major migrant labor exporting regions in China.[45] 

Based on previous studies,[16, 24–26] we presumed the prevalence 
rate of DD was 0.025, with a precision of 0.011, a response rate of 
0.85, a conﬁdence interval of 95% (95%CI), and a design effect of 1.2. 
PASS 2008 (LLC, Kaysville, UT, USA) estimated the sample size to 
be approximately 4,500. In this study, eligible subjects are deﬁned as 
follows: (1) community children who were 6–14-year old; (2) children 
whose parents or guardians agreed to participate; and (3) children who 
had been living in Wuhan for at least 6 months by November 15, 
2009, irrespective of their household registration status (local perma- 
nent resident or nonlocal resident). Children were excluded if any of 
the following criteria were met: (1) no parent or guardian could give 
informed consent; (2) disabilities due to deafness and aphasia; (3) severe 
physical illness that obstructs communication; or (4) obvious intellec- 
tual disorder. 
We adopted a multistage, stratiﬁed cluster, random sampling 
method to obtain a representative sample of children. In stages 1 and 
2 of sampling, the 13 districts in Wuhan were divided into two strata 
(urban versus rural) on the basis of economic conditions, and then 16 
subdistricts in urban strata and nine townships in rural strata were ran- 
domly selected, respectively. Twenty-eight urban communities from 
identiﬁed subdistricts and 18 rural communities from identiﬁed town- 
ships were randomly selected proportional to size in stage 3. In the 
fourth stage, 80–120 households in each identiﬁed community were 
randomly selected. One child was randomly selected from those who 
were 6–14-year old in each selected household in the ﬁnal sampling 
stage. A ﬂow-chart describing the sampling details and participation 
rates is depicted in Fig. 1. 

DSM-IV DDs were assessed using the Chinese version of the Mini 
International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adoles- 
cents (MINI-KID) 5.0,[46, 47] with parallel child/adolescent (MINI- 
KID-C) and parent (MINI-KID-P) interview versions. The MINI- 
KID is a structured clinical diagnostic interview designed to assess 
the presence of DSM-IV mental disorders in children and adolescents 
aged 6–17 years. Both Chinese versions of the MINI-KID have been 
proven to be reliable and valid for mental disorders in Chinese chil- 
dren and adolescents.[46, 47] In our survey, DD was considered to be 
present when either the parent or child version of MINI-KID met the 
full DSM-IV DD diagnostic criteria. 
To diagnose minor depressive disorder (MIDD, one type of de- 
pressive disorder not otherwise speciﬁed), we changed the skip rule of 
MINI-KID MDD module. Our interviewers were asked to continue 
to inquire about the clinical signiﬁcance of depressive symptoms if the 
respondents presented with more than one depressive symptom item 
instead of the original rule, which requires at least ﬁve symptom items. 
This survey included MDD, DYD, and MIDD for establishing DD di- 
agnoses based on a 1-month time frame, and thus provided the current 
prevalence rates of DDs. 
In addition, each subject was given a questionnaire that inquired 
about the respondent’s age, gender, education year, marital status of 
his/her parents, family type, local residency status, mode of delivery, 
breastfeeding status, relationship of family members, parenting style, 
caregiver, and other socio-economic variables. In regards to the mental 
health service utilization, depressed respondents were asked if they 
had sought help or treatment for their emotional problems in their 
lifetime and what types of service they had received. According to the 
providers of mental health services, the care-seeking behaviors were 
classiﬁed into three categories: never sought help, saw a mental health 
professional (e.g. psychiatrists, psychologists, or licensed psychological 
consultants/counselors), or only saw a nonmental health professional 
(e.g. nonpsychiatric physicians/pediatricians, nurses, herbalists, witch 
doctors, or religious specialists). 

The survey was performed from November 2009 through June 
2010. Before respondents and their guardians were interviewed, a writ- 
ten informed consent was obtained from their guardians, and declara- 
tions of anonymity and conﬁdentiality were made. The Research Ethics 
Committee of Wuhan Mental Health Center approved this protocol. 
Professional treatment suggestions were also provided to the guardians 
of participants with diagnosed mental disorder. 
Face-to-face interviews occurred in the subject’s home. Two in- 
terviewers were assigned to each household to complete interviews 
separately (one administered the MINI-KID-C, the other one admin- 
istered the MINI-KID-P), for the purpose of reducing interference 
with the respondent’s family life. Children younger than 13 years were 
administered the MINI-KID-C interview along with their guardians. 
Questions were directed to the children, but the parents were encour- 
aged to interject if they felt that the children’s answers were unclear 
or inaccurate. For children aged 13 and 14 years, the MINI-KID-C 
was administered without a parent present. The MINI-KID-P was ad- 
ministered to the guardian of the subject. The interviewer made the 
ﬁnal decision using his/her best clinical judgment regarding whether 
a participant’s answers met the diagnostic criteria for the questions. 

The interviews were administered by 18 trained psychiatrists who 
were selected from eight psychiatric hospitals in Hubei Province and 
had at least 2 years of clinical experience. The psychiatrists underwent 
a 56-hr training program that included an overview of the MINI-KID, 
a detailed explanation on the use of the MINI-KID, role play, mock 
interviews, interview techniques, patient interviews, and survey proce- 
dures. The training program was closely monitored and supervised by 
two senior child psychiatrists. At the end of the program, all the inter- 
viewers attended an inter-rater reliability test involving six outpatients 
with childhood depression, two bipolar adolescents, four schizophre- 
nia children, four pupils, and three middle-school students. The kappa 
values between interviewers were very good (0.84 for the MINI-KID- 
C and 0.82 for the MINI-KID-P). 
To guarantee the representativeness of our community sample, we 
used the Family Policy Register System of the respective community 
to select the households with at least one child in the eligible age 







range. The Family Policy Register System belongs to “One-Child- 
Per-Family Policy,” which is a mandatory national policy to control 
the Chinese population. This system has the most comprehensive and 
up-to-date registration rate of community households with children 
and adolescents. 
Prior to the survey, a pilot study of 423 households was conducted in 
one urban community and one rural community, and 24 depressed sub- 
jects were identiﬁed through the MINI-KID interviews. Two senior 
child psychiatrists reassessed these depressed children and 18 normal 
children with DSM-IV criteria in a double-blind style and found that 
the agreement coefﬁcient was excellent (kappa = 0.94). 
During the survey period, the team leader randomly selected 5% 
of the respondents and assigned two blinded psychiatrists to reassess 
them with the MINI-KID independently. One hundred and forty- 
seven children completed the reassessment, and the kappa value for 
any DD was 0.93. The concordance of the MINI-KID-P with the 
MINI-KID-C was found to be 0.85. 
All the interviewers were required to submit the interview records 
on each working day. The data check on the completeness and logi- 
cality was completed before the interviewer’s submission. Errors and 
other ﬂaws were solved at the scene. 

Respondents who completed either version of the MINI-KID were 
weighted up to project to the original sample size and were corrected 
with nonresponse rates by age, sex, and region. We used the Complex 
Survey module in SPSS 17.0 for Windows to estimate the prevalence 
of DDs and the respective CIs. We examined associations of any DD 
with age, gender, and region using χ 2 and χ 2 for trend. The multivari- 
ate logistic regression model within the Complex Survey module was 
used to identify factors associated with depression. Associations be- 
tween depression and all potential predictors were assessed in univari- 
ate analyses, followed by multivariate analyses of the selected subsets. 
A variable was selected if it was statistically signiﬁcant at the nominal 
two-sided 0.05 level in the univariate analysis. Risk ratios (RRs) with 
95% CIs were generated for each variable. 


A total of 3,582 (79.4%) children were interviewed 
with at least one version of the MINI-KID: 752 (21.0%) 
subjects completed one version of the MINI-KID and 
2,830 (79.0%) subjects completed both child and parent 
version of the MINI-KID, respectively (Fig. 1). A total of 
931 subjects were ineligible for the diagnostic interview 
for various reasons. Compared to the 3,582 completers, 
the 931 noncompleters had a higher proportion of rural 
kids (43.1% versus 38.2%, χ 2 = 7.39, P = .007) and older 
children (10.77 ± 3.42 versus 9.89 ± 2.53, t = 8.74, P 
< .001) but were comparable in the proportion of girls 
(45.0% versus 47.6%, χ 2 = 1.95, P = .162). 



The weighted prevalence of any DD was found to be 
2.8% (95%CI: 1.5–3.9) (Table 2). Among the DDs, the 
most common category was MDD with a prevalence of 
1.4% (95%CI: 1.0–1.8). Overall, DDs were signiﬁcantly 
more common among girls, rural children, and older 
kids. 
Figure 2 presented the gender-speciﬁc prevalence 
rates of DDs from ages 6–14. Rates were similar before 
the age of 9 and increased steadily after the age of 10 in 
both sexes, but were markedly higher in girls between 
the ages of 10 and 14. 

In the multivariate analysis (the last column of 
Table 1), depression was signiﬁcantly correlated with the 
older age groups (9–11-year old and 12–14-year old), not 
attending school, having unmarried parent(s), living in 
a nonnuclear family (single parent family or parentless 
family), being taken care of by people other than both 
parents (single parent, grandparent(s), other relatives, or 
others) during the past year, and not being breastfed be- 
fore 1 year of age. 
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE USE OF DEPRESSIVE 
CHILDREN 
Only 5 (5.81%) children with depression had received 
professional help at some point in the past, and greater 
than 90% of the individuals with any DD never received 
any professional help (Table 3). 
DISCUSSION 
The present child depression survey was completed 
in one phase, and the majority of children and their 
guardians contributed information that was used to de- 
cide whether the child had a DD. This approach largely 
eliminated the loss of precision that may occur with a 
two-phase design. This survey was conducted in only 
one city of China, thus we should be cautious in gener- 
alizing our data. However, our study is one of the very 
few investigations that uses the MINI-KID, which is a 
strict standardized diagnostic evaluation tool adminis- 
tered by well-trained professional psychiatrists. The ad- 
vantage of interviews administered by professionals is 
that it increases the accuracy of the clinical relevance of 
the diagnoses. 
In a child and adolescent psychiatric assessment, it is 
typically recommended that data from multiple infor- 
mants be used, but there is still disagreement on how 
parent and child reports should be combined in epi- 
demiological studies.[48] While there may be discrep- 
ancies between the two versions of the MINI-KID, we 
believe that the diagnoses from both versions are valid, 
as the original version of the MINI-KID-P has been 
observed to have good concordance with the standard 
MINI-KID-C.[49] We also found a high concordance 
rate between the MINI-KID-C and the MINI-KID-P 
in this study. A DD is considered to be present if either 
the parent or child reported version satisﬁes DSM-IV 
diagnostic criteria. This “OR rule” helps to redress un- 
derreporting by one informant, and although it might be 
criticized as overinclusive, it seems to be more justiﬁed.

cents, even if MIDD was excluded. The current preva- 
lence of any DD in our study was lower than the ﬁg- 
ures of depressive episode prevalence rates (2.92 and 
4.80%) in two Chinese epidemiological surveys that 
used psychiatric interviews and ICD-10 criteria[27, 30] 
but was signiﬁcantly higher than the CCMD-3 (Chi- 
nese Classiﬁcation of Mental Disorders, Third Edition) 
prevalence rates of two surveys (0% for both) that used 
psychiatric interviews[29, 34] and the Weinberg Depres- 
sion Criteria[53] rate (1.85%).[54] Compared to west- 
ern studies, the present study found higher depres- 
sion prevalence rates than those reported previously 
in New Zealand (2.30%),[55] Spain (1.43%),[42] Britain 
(0.87%),[41] Brazil (1.00%),[10] Denmark (0.80%),[32] 
and Norway (0.18%).[56] After the exclusion of MIDD, 
the remaining prevalence rate (1.9%) was still higher 
than that of most western countries. This study also pre- 
sented higher depression prevalence rates when com- 
pared with those of developing countries in Asia (India: 
0.10%,[39] Bangladesh: 0.0%,[40] and Yemen: 0.30%[31]). 
However, three surveys that were conducted in Iran,[38] 
Turkey,[22] and India[21] reported higher prevalence 
rates than those of our study: 4.90, 4.20, and 3.13%, 
respectively. Although the prevalence and methodol- 
ogy of these surveys varied widely (Table 4), these

gender. 
Alternatively, we can consider a diagnosis to be conferred 
only when both versions individually meet DD diagnos- 
tic criteria, which would be a very stringent demand, but 
this is rarely required by the DSM-IV for a diagnosis. 
In this study, the prevalence of at least one current DD 
in 6–14-year-old children was 2.8%. The overall preva- 
lence rates for DDs in our adolescent sample (4.6%) were 
comparable to those reported in a recent epidemiolog- 
ical survey of the adult Chinese population,[50] which 
suggests that adult DD might be adolescent DD in a 
recurrent form. As shown in Fig. 2, the gender dif- 
ference in rates of depression emerged during adoles- 
cence. This phenomenon might be an indirect reﬂec- 
tion of the association between pubertal status and de- 
pression in adolescent girls.[51] Six previous school-based 
surveys have reported that the current prevalence rates 
of DDs among Chinese children aged 5–17 years range 
between 0.93 and 1.62%[23–26, 52] and 2.70%[33] in Chi- 
nese adolescents. Although our sample had a smaller age 
range (6–14 years), the overall prevalence of current de- 
pression in our study was still higher than the previ- 
ous ﬁndings reported for Chinese children and adoles- 













comparisons indicate that children in this part of China 
have a relatively high prevalence of depression. 
Analyses of related factors indicated that, in commu- 
nities, depression was more prevalent among kids who 
were older than 8 years, did not go to school, had un- 
married parent(s), were living in an incomplete family, 
were taken care of by people other than both parents, 
and were not breastfed before the age of 1 year. These 
ﬁndings indicate that the etiologies of childhood depres- 
sion are complex and multifactorial. In western coun- 
tries, many factors have been reported to be associated 
with early-onset depression, including the following: de- 
mographic factors (e.g. older age, female, low socioeco- 
nomic status),[12, 57, 58] familial factors (e.g. parental psy- 
chology, early-onset mood disorders, high familial load- 
ing for mood disorders),[11, 12, 59] family factors (e.g. fam- 
ily conﬂict, parental divorce)[58–61] and psychosocial fac- 
tors (e.g. poor support, stressful life events, poor mater- 
nal function).[12] The associations between age, marital 
status of parents and depression that we observed in our 
study are consistent with previous western studies. How- 
ever, most of our ﬁndings from the risk factor analysis 
are relatively inconsistent with those reported in west- 
ern countries. This phenomenon might be a reﬂection of 
cultural differences. Exposure to parental depression is 
an especially strong predictor of depression for western 
children and adolescents.[62, 63] However, the association 
between family history of psychiatric illness and depres- 
sion disappeared in the multivariate analysis in our study. 
One possible explanation as to why a family history of 
psychiatric illness did not increase the risk for childhood 
depression is that the parents’ mental illness history was 
underreported because of the deep-rooted mental dis- 
ease stigma in the Chinese culture.[64] Interestingly, a 
rarely reported association between breastfeeding and 
depression was found in our study, which is partly con- 
sistent with a recent study showing that babies that were 
breastfed for longer than 6 months had signiﬁcantly bet- 
ter mental health in childhood.[65] 
Subjects selected from schools are a biased subset of 
children with less disorders, less symptom severity, and 
less impairment than children from communities. Our 
study found that children who did not attend school had 
a higher risk for depression, thus supporting our pre- 
vious hypothesis that community children have higher 
depression prevalence than school children. Our ﬁnd- 
ings on the associations between family types, dominant 
caregivers, and depression in the present study are very 
notable. Both ﬁndings clearly suggest that parents and 
family factors play an important role in the mental de- 
velopment of children. The national statistical data[66] 
indicates that the internal migration of the rural popu- 
lation has been a key force in the child care-taking pat- 
terns of the rural areas in contemporary China. Children 
in single-parent and grandparent-only families, or who 
were cared for by others, had poorer mental health than 
children living with two biological parents.[67] Despite 
the fact that the migration of parents out of rural ar- 
eas can lead to improvements in living conditions and 
physical health of children, it may cause deﬁciencies in 
parenting. Children being left behind has been linked 
to disorders such as depression and anxiety.[19, 68] In our 
sample, subjects who were cared for by people other than 
both parents accounted for 25.2% of the total sample 
(of the 25.2%, 80.8% were rural children), and 48.8% 
(42/86) of the depressed children were not cared for by 
their two biological parents. Thus, the high prevalence 
rate of DD in this study is not surprising. 
Unfortunately, among the 86 depressed children iden- 
tiﬁed from our study, only 5 (5.8%) ever sought help 
from mental health professionals for their depression. 
Viewed from a global perspective, the underutilization 
of mental health services by children is a universal prob- 
lem. In western countries, more than 70% of teenagers 
with DDs do not receive any form of diagnosis and 
treatment,[56, 69], and a majority of psychosocial disor- 
ders in children have been missed.[70] Undoubtedly, the 
low service utilization rate is a greater problem in Chi- 
nese children. Possible reasons for this may include the 
stigma associated with depression, atypical clinical man- 
ifestation, a lack of adequate child mental health training 
for health care professionals, an inadequate number of 
child psychiatrists, a lower parental perceived need for 
children’s mental health care, and inequalities in mental 
health care insurance for rural children in China. 
This study has several limitations that should be noted. 
First, reliable assessment of depression in children re- 
quires gathering information from the parent, child, and 
teacher, as well as from all other available informants.[71] 
Our diagnoses of DDs based on parent and child re- 
ports has limitation, as teachers could supply more dis- 
ease information (i.e. irritability, peer relationship, and 
academic performance in school) of individuals with 
“difﬁcult-to-diagnose” depression. Second, our study 
was primarily focused on the prevalence of depression 
but not on the correlates of depression, therefore, the 
problem of overﬁtting is inevitable in our logistic regres- 
sion model,[72] as we studied quite a few candidate pre- 
dictors but the number of detected depression (“events”) 
was relatively small. Although the risk factors identiﬁed 
in our study seem consistent with those in previous re- 
ports, whether they also apply to other regions in China 
is still questionable. Finally, as we used “OR rule” to gen- 
erate DD diagnoses, there should be a low prevalence in 
the 752 subjects who only completed one version of the 
MINI-KID, which indicated that the overall prevalence 
rates of DDs in our full sample might be underestimated. 
Meanwhile, the nonresponse bias from older and more 
rural subjects in nonrecruited sample also might make 
us underestimate the depression prevalence. 
CONCLUSION 
The present study has demonstrated a relatively high 
prevalence of depression and an extremely low men- 
tal health service utilization rate among a community- 
based sample of 6–14-year-old Chinese children. De- 
pression is a substantial and largely unrecognized issue 



among children, which suggests that it has been a ma- 
jor public health issue for Chinese children. Given the 
many negative impacts of depression on our children and 
society, there is an urgent need to develop efﬁcacious 
interventions aimed at the prevention and early recog- 
nition of childhood depression. There may be an even 
greater need for community-based programs to promote 
rural child and adolescent mental health.
