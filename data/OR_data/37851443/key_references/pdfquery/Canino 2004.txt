Background: Few prevalence studies in which DSM-IV 
criteria were used in children in representative commu- 
nity samples have been reported. We present preva- 
lence data for the child and adolescent population of 
Puerto Rico and examine the relation of DSM-IV diag- 
noses to global impairment, demographic correlates, and 
service use in an island-wide representative sample. 
Methods: We sampled 1886 child-caretaker dyads in 
Puerto Rico by using a multistage sampling design. Chil- 
dren were aged 4 to 17 years. Response rate was 90.1%. 
Face-to-face interviews of children and their primary care- 
takers were performed by trained laypersons who ad- 
ministered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Chil- 
dren, version IV (DISC-IV) in Spanish. Global impairment 
was measured by using the Children’s Global Assess- 
ment Scale scored by the interviewer of the parent. Re- 
ports of service use were obtained by using the Service 
Assessment for Children and Adolescents. 
Results: Although 19.8% of the sample met DSM-IV cri- 
teria without considering impairment, 16.4% of the popu- 
lation had 1 or more of the DSM-IV disorders when a mea- 
sure of impairment specific to each diagnosis was 
considered. The overall prevalence was further reduced 
to 6.9% when a measure of global impairment was added 
to that definition. The most prevalent disorders were at- 
tention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (8.0%) and oppo- 
sitional defiant disorder (5.5%). Children in urban set- 
tings had higher rates than those in rural regions. Older 
age was related to higher rates of major depression and 
social phobia, and younger age was related to higher rates 
of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Both overall 
rates and rates of specific DSM-IV/DISC-IV disorders were 
related to service use. Children with impairment with- 
out diagnosis were more likely to use school services, 
whereas children with impairment with diagnosis were 
more likely to use the specialty mental health sector. Of 
those with both a diagnosis and global impairment, only 
half received services from any source. 
Conclusions: Because we used the DISC-IV to apply 
DSM-IV criteria, the study yielded prevalence rates that 
are generally comparable with those found in previous 
surveys. The inclusion of diagnosis-specific impairment 
criteria reduced rates slightly. When global impairment 
criteria were imposed, the rates were reduced by approxi- 
mately half. 


sion, DSM-III-R,2 facili- 
plicit diagnostic criteria in 
the DSM-III1 and its revi- 
tated several large-scale epi- 
demiological studies of mental disorder in 
the United States on the basis of psychiat- 
ric diagnosis.3-7 Many of the revisions in 
DSM-IV8 followed from results of epide- 
miological and clinical studies suggesting 
that disorders previously thought to de- 
velop in adulthood were also evident in 
childhood and that children and adoles- 
cents could experience a wide variety of 
problems and manifestations of distress that 
fail to satisfy criteria of a mental disor- 
der.9,10 These studies also provided new in- 
sights into the prevalence and comorbid- 
ity of mental disorders, the role of 
impairment in arriving at meaningful di- 
agnoses, and the discrepancies between 
rates of need for services and actual ser- 
vice provision. When DSM-IV was devel- 
oped, epidemiological information based on 
DSM-III and DSM-III-R study results was 
critical in fine-tuning the diagnostic crite- 
ria and integrating clinical significance in 
the formulation of the disorders. 
Starting with DSM-III, all versions of 
the DSM stipulated that to qualify for a psy- 
chiatric diagnosis, a disorder must gener- 
ally meet a “clinical significance” crite- 
rion that involves features of impairment 
or distress. However, in DSM-IV, this cri- 
terion was made more explicit. The 
DSM-IV includes clinical significance 
among the essential criteria for most spe- 
cific disorders, with only the most obvi-

ous and impairing conditions (eg, schizophrenia and other 
psychotic disorders) excepted.11 The implications of these 
revisions in the DSM have only begun to be explored em- 
pirically for both adult12 and childhood9,13 disorders, al- 
though the revisions have generated considerable theo- 
retical debate.14,15 
The explicit clinical significance requirement has led 
to the development of epidemiological diagnostic instru- 
ments based on the DSM-IV that for the first time make 
clinical significance a prerequisite for each of the disor- 
ders measured. When impairment in functioning was not 
taken into account, a number of epidemiological studies 
that applied DSM-III and DSM-III-R criteria4,5,16 reported 
prevalence rates higher than 30% for diagnosable mental 
disorders. Although such high rates were not universal find- 
ings, they suggested that the DSM-III and DSM-III-R, as 
operationalized in certain structured diagnostic instru- 
ments, tended to be overly inclusive.17-19 It is still not clear 
the extent to which these findings are caused by charac- 
teristics of the taxonomy or to the way in which the tax- 
onomy is operationalized in instruments. 
New measurement procedures have been devel- 
oped to implement the clinical significance and other cri- 
teria changes in the DSM-IV, and several of the proce- 
dures are designed for assessing persons in community 
samples and/or in primary care settings.20,21 Although there 
are still a number of substantial and unresolved issues 
regarding valid and reliable assessment of psychiatric sta- 
tus and functioning in children and adolescents,8,10-22 it 
is important to inform the discussion of these issues by 
presenting systematic data collected by using the latest 
measures and the latest diagnostic criteria. Few epide- 
miological studies of prevalence rates of child psychiat- 
ric disorders and their correlates based on DSM-IV cri- 
teria have been reported.23 
To add to the pool of data regarding how DSM-IV 
criteria apply to general population samples, we present 
findings about the prevalence and correlates of child and 
adolescent disorders defined according to the DSM-IV in 
a representative sample of children aged 4 to 17 years on 
the island of Puerto Rico who were interviewed be- 
tween 1999 and 2000. The DSM-IV diagnoses were op- 
erationally determined by using the Diagnostic Inter- 
view Schedule for Children, version IV (DISC-IV).24 The 
DISC-IV has added questions to assess the clinical sig- 
nificance (impairment or distress) to the diagnostic sched- 
ules of each of the disorders it measures. To illustrate the 
importance of including clinical significance as 1 of the 
criteria that defines each psychiatric disorder, we high- 
light the issue of clinical significance by reporting DSM-IV 
disorders with and without disorder-specific impairment- 
distress criteria. The issue of impairment is further ex- 
amined by considering information from a global im- 
pairment rating, the Parent Interview–Children’s Global 
Assessment Scale (PIC-GAS).18 
We considered it important to include both the mea- 
sure of specific impairment and the global measure for sev- 
eral reasons. First, the assessment of specific impairment, 
such as that obtained with the DISC-IV, is a subjective rat- 
ing requiring that the respondent establish a causal con- 
nection between the symptoms of a specific diagnosis and 
resulting impairment or distress. Although these ratings have 
demonstrated reliability,25 the accuracy with which par- 
ents or children can make the attribution of impairment 
to the specific symptoms has never been validated and is 
therefore open to question.26 We wanted to provide differ- 
ent alternatives for assessing impairment and elected to use 
the global measure, PIC-GAS, which has demonstrated re- 
liability and validity.18 
Another consideration for including both mea- 
sures was that the DISC impairment measures also in- 
corporate an item that relates to distress caused by the 
symptoms. In attempting to adhere to DSM-IV criteria, 
we considered it important to include the notion of dis- 
tress, as well as that of impairment. We also wanted to 
measure need for mental health services by using a defi- 
nition of need for services that includes meeting criteria 
for a disorder and substantial impairment in function- 
ing. Because clinical significance is such an important is- 
sue, we did not want to rely exclusively on a single mea- 
sure. Moreover, the rating of global impairment takes into 
account all aspects of the child’s overall functioning, 
whereas the DISC schedules used in the present study 
include only a selected group of DSM-IV disorders. It is 
conceivable, for example, that a child with autism or an- 
other serious developmental disorder not included in the 
DISC could have results negative for the DISC diag- 
noses being considered, as well as for diagnosis-specific 
impairment on the DISC-IV, and still be substantially im- 
paired in functioning. 
Besides reporting last-year prevalence rates of se- 
lected DSM-IV disorders, with and without clinical sig- 
nificance criteria, we report rates of mental health ser- 
vice use among those with and those without targeted 
DSM-IV diagnoses. The patterns of service use not only 
provide useful information for policy makers who use 
prevalence estimates, but they also provide insights into 
the interpretation of both diagnostic and impairment in- 
formation. 
There are several advantages in studying DSM-IV/ 
DISC-IV diagnoses in a representative island-wide sample 
of the Puerto Rican population. This population in- 
cludes the full spectrum of socioeconomic status, with 
children living in different contexts of economic advan- 
tage and poverty in both urban and rural areas. The sample 
obtained for the present study represents the full range 
of diversity of the child population. These factors en- 
hance the generalizability of the findings. Although Puerto 
Rico clearly differs from mainland American popula- 
tions in language, culture, and distribution of risk fac- 
tors, prevalence studies of both adult and child psychi- 
atric disorder performed in Puerto Rico have shown 
remarkable similarity to overall trends in the United 
States.16,27-30 
Most child psychiatric epidemiological studies have 
focused on a narrow age range or on specific age groups.17 
Our study includes children from a broad age range of 4 
to 17 years. We are able to analyze patterns of associa- 
tion between rates of disorder and sex, parental educa- 
tion, family income, and urban vs rural residence to verify 
if relations between psychiatric disorder and these demo- 
graphic factors are similar to those found elsewhere, as 
well as to findings of an island-wide child study of DSM- 
III disorders performed in 1985.16

An island-wide household probability sample of children aged 
4 to 17 years was drawn from 4 strata: Puerto Rico’s health re- 
form areas, urban vs rural areas, participant age, and partici- 
pant sex. Block groups defined in the US Bureau of the Popu- 
lation and Housing 1990 Census for Puerto Rico were the 
primary sampling units. These groups were classified accord- 
ing to economic level and size, grouped into block clusters, and 
further classified as urban or rural. 
Clusters of households were randomly selected from each 
stratum, households with children aged 4 to 17 years were se- 
lected from the clusters, and 1 child was selected from each 
household by using Kish tables31 adjusted for age and sex. From 
2102 eligible households, 1886 parent-child dyads were inter- 
viewed for a total response rate of 90.1%. 
The sample was weighted to represent the general popu- 
lation of children in Puerto Rico in the year 2000. The weights 
correct for differences in the probability of selection because 
of the sampling design and adjust for nonresponse. To ac- 
count for the complex sampling design, SEs were estimated 
(SUDAAN software release 8.0; Research Triangle Institute, 
Durham, NC). 
Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the 
sample before poststratification. The distribution by age and 
sex of the sample obtained is similar to that of the Puerto Rican 
population as described in the 2000 US census. The final sample 
of 1897 children constituted a sampling fraction of approxi- 
mately 2.2 per 1000 children in the population. 


Last-year DSM-IV psychiatric disorders were assessed by us- 
ing the latest translation into Spanish of the DISC-IV,25 with 
parallel youth and parent interview versions. The test-retest re- 
liability of the DISC-IV has been reported in both Spanish- 
speaking and English-speaking clinic samples and yielded com- 
parable results.24,25 
The DISC-IV inquires about the level of impairment and 
distress associated with each diagnosis through probes that de- 
termine the degree to which the symptoms of a given diagno- 
sis have caused distress to the child or affected his or her school 
functioning or relations with caretakers, family, friends, or teach- 
ers. The test-retest reliability of the impairment and distress 
probes were fair to moderate; most (cid:1) values ranged from 0.42 
to 0.80 for most disorders assessed.25 
Children younger than 11 years were not interviewed with 
the DISC because there is evidence that their reports would not 
be reliable.32 The substance abuse disorders schedules were ad- 
ministered in children aged 11 to 17 years but not to their par- 
ents, whereas oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) was ex- 
cluded from the child protocol. Parents tend to be unaware of 
the use of substances in their adolescent children and are not 
considered good sources of information for substance use dis- 
orders in their children. Results of prior studies in which Puerto 
Rican and mainland samples were included have also shown 
poor reliability for ODD in child reports, as well as poor con- 
cordance with clinical diagnosis.33 
The official DISC-IV scoring algorithms use data from par- 
ent and child informants and allow the ascertainment of the pres- 
ence of a diagnosis, with or without impairment as measured with 
the DISC impairment scales. In this article, we use the DISC im- 
pairment algorithm that refers to moderate impairment in at least 
1 area of functioning. The rates reported include both parent and 

child informants for children aged 11 to 17 years, and only par- 
ent informants for children younger than 11 years. A case is con- 
sidered positive if it meets full DSM-IV diagnostic criteria ac- 
cording to either the parent or child DISC-IV. 

Overall global impairment in functioning was measured by us- 
ing the PIC-GAS. The PIC-GAS is the lay version of the Chil- 
dren’s Global Assessment Scale.18 The concurrent, discrimi- 
nant, and construct validity of the PIC-GAS have been reported 
by using combined data from 4 communities, including data 
from Puerto Rico.18 Although the PIC-GAS is presented in 10 
deciles that describe different levels of functioning, the instruc- 
tions for assigning scores on the PIC-GAS, as well as on the 
DSM-IV Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, specifically 
encourage raters to “use intermediary levels.” Previous psy- 
chometric work with the clinician Children’s Global Assess- 
ment Scale34 revealed that a score lower than 65 was the best 
cutoff to distinguish between those definitely impaired and those 
not impaired. Similar psychometric work with the PIC-GAS 
shows that with lay raters, a score lower than 69 is optimal to 
identify children who are impaired in functioning.18 
To our knowledge, none of the publications available have 
shown empirically derived cutoff scores to distinguish those who 
are mildly, moderately, or severely impaired. Therefore, we have 
opted to use a cutoff lower than 69 on the PIC-GAS coupled with 
diagnosis-specific impairment ratings to operationalize the clas- 
sification of serious emotional disturbance that is considered by 
the US federal government in reimbursing states for mental health 
services.35 This definition requires the presence of a DSM-IV di- 
agnosis with substantial impairment in functioning. 

The Spanish-language version of the Service Assessment for Chil- 
dren and Adolescents (SACA)36 was used to ascertain the types 
of services and treatments used by children for emotional, al- 
cohol, and drug problems. The instrument inquires about life- 
time and last-year use of 25 specific service settings that are 
divided among inpatient-residential, outpatient, and school set- 
tings.37 The outpatient setting is disaggregated into mental health 
outpatient and general health outpatient. The mental health out- 
patient includes patients who attended a mental health or sub- 
stance abuse clinic or saw a professional in a private office. The 
Spanish-language SACA has shown fair to moderate reliabil- 
ity, with most (cid:1) values ranging from 0.41 to 0.87 for most ser- 
vices reported by parents and children, as well as moderate to 
substantial sensitivity when parental reports were compared 
without medical records.36 The SACA has 2 versions (parent 
and child), and use of services was considered positive if a posi- 
tive response was given by either parent or child.

The survey was performed from January 1999 through Decem- 
ber 2000. The child’s biological mother was the adult infor- 
mant in 89.4% of the cases. Interviews took place in the sub- 
ject’s home, with different interviewers for parent and child, 
and interviewers were blinded to the results of each other’s in- 
terviews. Interviews were audio taped, and 15% were spot- 
checked for quality control. 

PREVALENCE RATES WITH 
AND WITHOUT IMPAIRMENT 
Table 2 presents the last-year prevalence rates of spe- 
cific DSM-IV/DISC-IV disorders for children aged 4 to 
17 years. Prevalence is reported in 4 ways. The first col- 
umn shows the presence of DISC diagnostic criteria in 
either parent or child report, without taking clinical sig- 
nificance (impairment and distress resulting from symp- 
toms) into account. The rates reported in the second col- 
umn qualify the column 1 diagnoses by requiring at least 
1 level of DISC-IV impairment or distress according to 
either parent or child. Therefore, the values in the sec- 
ond column refer to disorders that meet full DSM-IV cri- 
teria. The third column presents rates based on the pres- 
ence of criteria for diagnosis in either parent or child 
without the DISC impairment criteria but with global im- 
pairment as measured with the PIC-GAS with a score 
lower than 69. The rates appearing in the fourth col- 
umn require the presence of DISC-IV criteria for diag- 
nosis according to either parent or child, with DISC-IV 
impairment and a global impairment score lower than 
69 on the PIC-GAS. 
The proportion of the sample that appeared to have 
met all DSM-IV criteria except for the impairment crite- 
rion is 19.8% (first column of Table 2). Prevalence rates 
are all greater without impairment than when impair- 
ment is considered. The second column is a more faith- 
ful representation of DSM-IV criteria, in that it requires 
both diagnosis and some degree of specific impairment 
or distress to be present. When all diagnoses assessed with 
some impairment are considered (second column), 16.4% 
of the sample has 1 or more DSM-IV diagnoses. The spe- 
cific diagnosis with the highest prevalence is attention- 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (8.0%), followed 
by ODD (5.5%), separation anxiety (3.1%), and major 
depression (3.0%). 
In contrast, the third column shows the prevalence 
rates when global impairment (PIC-GAS score lower 
than 69) is substituted for the DISC-IV disorder-spe- 
cific impairment criteria. The rates in this column are 
not consistent with the full DSM-IV criteria, in that they 
take into account clinical significance of mental disor- 
der as measured with global impairment instead of im- 
pairment due to specific symptoms. The rate for any di-

agnosis is reduced from 16.4% to 7.6% (third column). 
For both overall prevalence and the diagnostic group- 
ings, the effect of the global impairment qualification, 
as compared with the standard DSM-IV/DISC-IV defini- 
tion that includes the DISC impairment scales, tends to 
reduce the prevalence rate much more (about half). In 
the fourth column, both global impairment and the 
DISC-IV disorder-specific impairment criteria are in- 
cluded in the designation of a case, and the rate is re- 
duced slightly from 7.6% to 6.9%. 

Prior to the development of the DSM-IV, a number of 
demographic factors were shown to relate to child psy- 
chiatric disorder.30,38,39 To determine which of these cor- 
relates of the diagnoses remain after the application of 
DSM-IV/DISC-IV criteria, we report in Table 3 associa- 
tions of the more prevalent disorders with age, sex, pa- 
rental education, household income, parental civil sta- 
tus, and urban vs rural residence. Odds ratios (ORs) were 
estimated by using logistic regression models that 
weighted the data for the sample design poststratified to 
the 2000 census results (SUDAAN). 
Boys had more disruptive disorders (OR = 1.6), 
ADHD (OR= 2.0), and ODD (OR =1.6), while girls had 
more depressive disorders in general (OR=0.3) and spe- 
cifically major depression (OR= 0.4). Age had a mixed 
pattern of associations with these childhood disorders. 
Rates tended to increase with age for depressive disor- 
ders (OR=5.2), anxiety disorders (OR=1.7), social pho- 
bia (OR = 2.4), and major depression (OR = 4.6). Rates 
tended to decrease with age for ADHD (OR= 0.5), and 
there was no reliable age association with any disrup- 
tive disorder, specifically conduct disorder and ODD, or 
with separation anxiety disorder. Neither parental edu- 
cation nor income was related to any of the disorders as- 
sessed. Children whose parents were not married (single, 
separated, widowed, or divorced) were more likely to meet 
criteria for any studied DISC-IV disorder and major de- 
pressive disorder. In addition, children who lived in ur- 
ban areas were more likely to meet criteria for any diag- 
nosis (OR=1.9), any disruptive disorder (OR=1.9), and 
ADHD (OR=2.1).

pected, children with DSM-IV diagnoses and impair- 
ment used the most services, but only half of the chil- 
dren (49.6%) in this group received any type of service. 
Overall, school services were more frequently used than 
any other service and were used by children who were 
impaired regardless of whether they met DSM-IV/ 
DISC-IV criteria. 
To further assess the relative power of DSM-IV/ 
DISC-IV and global impairment (PIC-GAS score lower 
than 69) to predict service use, we performed a series of 
logistic regression analyses. The results (Table 5) showed 
that for all service categories except for any school ser- 
vice, use could be described in terms of main effects of 
both diagnosis (present/absent) and global impairment 
(present/absent). The DISC diagnosis and global impair- 
ment were both strongly associated with all types of ser- 
vice use, but the effects of global impairment were gen- 
erally stronger than the effects of diagnosis, with the 
exception of use of the specialty mental health sector (any 
mental health professional), for which diagnosis had a 
larger OR than did global impairment. 
For any school service, the interaction term was sig- 
nificant. As shown in the Figure, about one third of chil- 
dren who had PIC-GAS scores lower than 69 received 
school services, regardless of the presence of a diagno- 
sis. Among those with no impairment and no diagnosis, 
school services were used by 6.8%, and use increased to 
17.6% among those with a diagnosis.

Our results are generally consistent with previous DSM- 
III prevalence rates reported for the island,16 despite changes 
in the nosology and the new version of the DISC that was 
used. In both the survey performed in 1985 and the cur- 
rent study, the relative frequency with which the disor- 
ders occurred was similar, even though the prevalence rates 
of the specific disorders were somewhat different. In both 
surveys, ADHD and ODD were approximately twice as com- 
mon as were major depression, separation anxiety, social 
phobia, generalized anxiety, and conduct disorder. 
Nevertheless, we identified differences in preva- 
lence rates across these studies that cannot be attrib- 
uted solely to the application of a clinical significance 
criterion such as was used in our present data set. These 
differences in prevalence rates are likely to be influ- 
enced by differences in the methods used in the sur- 
veys. The 1985 DSM-III survey inquired about 6-month 
prevalence rates rather than the year rates of the current 
survey. It also combined information from child and 
parent informants in all ages, whereas information from 
both informants in the present survey was combined 
only in the children aged 11 to 17 years. Furthermore, 
the 1985 rates were based on clinical judgment by cli- 
nicians who used a prior version of the DISC to struc- 
ture the interview, whereas in this study diagnoses were 
estimated with a structured diagnostic interview used 
by lay interviewers. 
The DSM-IV/DISC-IV prevalence rates we report are 
not fully consistent with those from a recently reported 
DSM-IV study performed among black and white youth 
in North Carolina. In that study, Angold et al23 reported 
lower rates of ADHD, ODD, and major depression than 
those obtained in the present study, but they found higher 
rates of conduct disorder and substance use. Several fac- 
tors may help explain these differences. The lower rates 
could be explained by the fact that the Angold et al23 sur- 
vey used an interviewer-based structured interview19 dif- 
ferent from the one we used. Moreover, they reported a 
3-month prevalence rate rather than a 1-year prevalence 
rate, and the children assessed were aged 9 to 17 years and 
living in rural areas. Their study also included a wider range 
of psychiatric disorders than does the present study. Nev- 
ertheless, Angold and colleagues23 performed further analy- 
ses of their data with the same diagnoses evaluated in the 
present study (oral communication, November 2002) and 
found rates of any DSM-IV disorder of 17.7% (95% con- 
fidence interval, 15%-20%) that are similar to the rate in 
this study of 17.3% (95% confidence interval, 14.5%- 
20.7%), when we excluded children aged 4 to 8 years from 
our rates to make the analyses comparable. 
Previous reports of rates of specific diagnoses based 
on earlier versions of the DSM and in which the same 
assessment instruments were used have shown few dif- 
ferences in rates between Puerto Rico and mainland lo- 
calities, with 1 salient exception. The rates of conduct 
disorder in both our 1985 survey40 and in the Methods 
for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental 
Disorders study26 have been compared with those ob- 
tained in mainland populations and were lower among 
island Puerto Rican children and adolescents. Lower 
rates of substance use disorders in both adult and ado- 
lescent populations have also been reported for island 
Puerto Ricans, as compared with findings in mainland 
populations.41,42 The lower rates appear to be related to 
the extent to which correlates of these disorders appear 
on the island, the most salient being better family rela- 
tions and social support.26 
Similar to results of other surveys,16,43,44 our study 
results showed many of the expected associations of 
ADHD, ODD, anxiety disorders, and depressive disor- 
ders with age and sex.10,43,45 Unlike results of many stud- 
ies of mental disorder among children and adoles- 
cents,46-48 including the earlier study16 in Puerto Rico, we 
found no associations between rates of disorder and in- 
dicators of socioeconomic status, such as parents’ edu- 
cation and family income. This unexpected finding led 
to further exploration. In one analysis, we constructed 
levels of income with 3 categories used by Costello et al46 
to define relative poverty: lowest third, middle third, and 
upper third. In another analysis, we combined parental 
income and education to define a familial high-risk group 
that was low in both income and education. Neither of 
these additional analyses revealed an association. How- 
ever, our failure to find that prevalence varies with tra- 
ditional measures of socioeconomic factors is consis- 
tent with results of a handful of studies that focused on 
impoverished families.23,49 
Beyond absolute and relative measures of poverty, we 
considered perceptions of what constitutes poverty. Forty- 
eight percent of Puerto Ricans live below the poverty level.50 
Our survey showed that only 22.2% of parents with an an- 
nual income below $12000 considered that they lived poorly 
or very poorly, while 42.8% of those thought they lived well 
or very well. Of parents in the $12001 to $25000 income 
level, 13.2% thought they lived poorly. When perception 
of poverty was substituted for actual income, we found that 
disruptive disorders (ADHD and ODD) were more fre- 
quent among those who reported that they lived poorly. 
Perception of poverty was not related to either anxiety or 
depressive disorders. This pattern is consistent with re- 
sults in other studies51,52 that reported stronger associa- 
tions between poverty and externalizing disorders than with 
internalizing disorders. The findings suggest that abso- 
lute or relative poverty indexes may not be the most ap- 
propriate measures to use in populations where most per- 
sons are of low income. Further development of measures 
of perceived poverty or the inclusion of measures of “so- 
cial capital,”53 such as the existence of job opportunities, 
community organization, and other community re- 
sources, may be more fruitful. 
We found that global impairment as indicated by a 
PIC-GAS score lower than 69 was an important predic- 
tor of service use, even when adjusting for the presence 
of a DSM-IV/DISC-IV disorder. Except for mental health 
specialty services, global impairment appeared to be as 
important, if not more important, than diagnosis in pre- 
dicting service. For school service use, presence of a di- 
agnosis was important only for children with PIC-GAS 
scores of 69 or higher. Service use among children with 
global impairment was the same for those with a diag- 
nosis as for those without a diagnosis as measured in our 
survey. It is possible that some of the children receiving

school services had disorders, such as learning, motor 
skills, and language disorders, that were not assessed in 
our study. Such disorders could have been perceived by 
counselors and teachers and therefore could have been 
addressed in school. Children with impairment without 
diagnosis may not have been eligible for specialty men- 
tal health treatment because they did not meet the eli- 
gibility criteria of severe emotional disturbance estab- 
lished by most states and insurance companies in both 
the mainland United States and Puerto Rico (ie, meet- 
ing criteria for DSM-IV disorder and substantial 
impairment).35 
The importance of impairment in our study is not 
simply a function of our use of logistic regression. Ale- 
grı´a et al54 found that impairment was the most impor- 
tant predictor of service use when parent decisions to seek 
service were modeled by using classification and regres- 
sion tree approaches.55 Given that 13.3% of the children 
in Puerto Rico were impaired (data not shown) and that 
this seems to be such an important predictor of service 
use, an important strategy for prevention interventions 
and policy makers should be the identification of chil- 
dren with impairment and intervening with parents and 
educators so that they can link impairment with the need 
for mental health service. 
As was shown in other research,7,44 our data showed 
that the inclusion of the DSM-IV clinical significance cri- 
terion with the diagnostic criteria of most Axis I diag- 
noses reduced the prevalence rates of disorders. The use 
of specific impairment items reduced by 18% the preva- 
lence from that obtained through criteria without impair- 
ment and distress. Rates were reduced by an additional 58% 
when a global impairment measure was included. Several 
investigators5,7,56 noted that prevalence rates vary accord- 
ing to the impairment measure used. These findings sug- 
gest the need for a consensus about how clinical signifi- 
cance is conceptualized, operationalized, and measured for 
both research and clinical purposes. Although progress has 
been made in the conceptualization of impairment by the 
World Health Organization in its International Classifica- 
tion of Functioning, Disability and Health,57 further work 
is needed to examine the applicability of this classifica- 
tion to children. Some of the discrepancies observed in 
prevalence rates among studies might be the result of such 
a lack of consensus; it may also contribute to the low level 
of concordance frequently observed among clinicians on 
clinical diagnostic assessments. 
The reduction in prevalence rates observed when the 
criterion of impairment and distress is introduced to the 
diagnostic criteria does not necessarily challenge the va- 
lidity of the DSM-IV. Some have argued that the inclu- 
sion of this criterion in most DSM-IV (Axis I) diagnoses 
is unnecessary11 because many disorders already in- 
clude in their symptom criteria impairment in function- 
ing. Nevertheless, the DSM-IV criteria, as implemented 
in epidemiological interview measures that incorporate 
impairment and distress, such as the DISC-IV, led to preva- 
lence rates in Puerto Rico that serve as reasonable work- 
ing hypotheses about the burden of mental disorders 
among children and adolescents. The information pro- 
vided by trained lay interviewers in a single assessment 
session can only begin to approximate a full profes- 
sional assessment that uses behavioral observations, mul- 
tiple informants, and, where available, biological tests. 
Economical methods to assess mental health and im- 
pairment due to mental disorders, such as those used in 
field surveys, provide the opportunity to determine the com- 
monness of the signs and symptoms of disorders that are 
proposed because of the nosology and to plan longitudi- 
nal studies of onset, course, and treatment of mental dis- 
orders. Perhaps more strikingly, these assessments are im- 
portant tools for planning mental health services and for 
assessing children with serious emotional disturbance in 
the educational system. Although the inclusion of specific 
clinical severity criteria in DSM-IV reduces prevalence es- 
timates, these lower rates do not automatically translate into 
lower service needs. Results of a comprehensive assess- 
ment of both diagnosable psychiatric disorder and global 
impairment suggest that services are needed for an impor- 
tant group of children who are below the threshold needed 
for a diagnosis but are nonetheless globally impaired. These 
findings, if replicated, have important implications for fu- 
ture revisions of the DSM-IV.
