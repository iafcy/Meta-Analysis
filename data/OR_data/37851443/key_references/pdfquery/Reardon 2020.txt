Abstract 
There is a lack of current data on help-seeking, and barriers to accessing professional support for child anxiety disorders. 
This study aimed to provide current data on the frequency and type of parental help-seeking, professional support received, 
and parent-reported barriers/facilitators in the context of child anxiety, and to explore factors associated with help-seeking, 
and parent-reported barriers among help-seekers and non help-seekers. We conducted a survey of help-seeking in parents 
of 222 children (aged 7–11) with elevated anxiety symptoms identified through screening in schools, 138 children of whom 
met diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder. Almost two-thirds (64.5%) of parents of children with an anxiety disorder 
reported seeking help from a professional; in 38.4% of cases parents reported that their child had received support from a 
professional to help manage and overcome their anxiety difficulties, and < 3% had received evidence-based treatment (CBT). 
Frequently reported parental barriers related to difficulties differentiating between developmentally appropriate and clini- 
cally significant anxiety, a lack of help-seeking knowledge, perceived negative consequences of help-seeking, and limited 
service provision. Non-help seekers were more likely than help seekers to report barriers related to thinking a child’s anxiety 
may improve without professional support, and the absence of professional recognition. Findings identify the need for (i) 
tools for parents and primary school staff to help identify children who may benefit from professional support to overcome 
difficulties with anxiety; and (ii) increased evidence-based provision for child anxiety disorders, including delivery within 
schools and direct support for parents. 


Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental health 
disorders experienced across the lifespan, with an average 
age of onset of 11 years [1]. Childhood anxiety disorders 
have a significant negative impact on educational, social, 
and health functioning, and are associated with continued 
anxiety and other mental health disorders in adulthood [2],

and substantial economic burden [3]. Cognitive behavioural 
therapy (CBT) is the most well-evaluated treatment for anxi- 
ety disorders in children [4], with evidence for long-term 
positive outcomes [5, 6]. However, poor rates of access to 
treatment for mental health problems in children are widely 
reported [7–9]. Studies report lower rates of treatment access 
among children with anxiety disorders compared to children 
with behavioural disorders [8, 10, 11], although there is a 
lack of current UK data on the number of families who seek 
and access professional support for child anxiety disorders, 
and we know little about the type of support families receive. 
The unmet need in relation to child mental health has 
prompted calls to improve access to effective early interven- 
tion [12]. Children typically rely on a parent or caregiver 
to seek help on their behalf so it is important that interven- 
tions designed to improve access to professional support 
for child mental health problems address barriers parents 
face throughout the help-seeking process [13]. Studies that 
explore factors associated with use of child mental health 



 


services help illustrate who does and who does not access 
treatment, and help identify potential barriers to accessing 
treatment. For example, if parents perceive a child’s diffi- 
culties to be problematic, and perceive a negative impact 
on family life, and need for professional help, a child is 
more likely to access mental health services than if parents 
do not recognise a child’s difficulties, associated impact 
or need for help [14]. Parents’ own experience of mental 
health problems and use of mental health services, and a 
child’s symptom severity are also associated with child 
mental health service use [15, 16]. However, few studies 
have explored help-seeking, specifically in the context of 
child anxiety disorders; given that reported rates of treat- 
ment access are lower for anxiety disorders compared to 
behavioural disorders, there may be barriers to help-seeking 
that are unique to anxiety difficulties. To identify key areas 
to target to improve treatment access, it is also pertinent to 
establish parents’ own views on barriers/facilitators asso- 
ciated with seeking and accessing professional support in 
the context of child anxiety. Salloum, et al. [17] described 
parental perceptions of barriers to treatment access within 
a sample of parents of children who received treatment for 
anxiety, but given that so few families reach services, we 
also need to consider the experiences of parents who have 
not sought and/or accessed support for their child. Indeed, 
qualitative interviews we conducted with parents of children 
with anxiety disorders identified in the community illustrate 
the range of difficulties parents can face recognising a child’s 
anxiety difficulties, identifying the need for support, contact- 
ing professionals for help or advice, and receiving support 
from professionals [18]. It is therefore important to establish 
barriers to both seeking help and obtaining support to help 
manage and overcome a child’s anxiety difficulties. Estab- 
lishing the extent to which parents report different types of 
barriers, and improving understanding of who experiences 
which types of barriers would help inform targeted interven- 
tions to both promote help-seeking and ensure more families 
receive appropriate support. 

This study aimed to build on the qualitative findings to date 
[18] by providing quantitative data on help-seeking within a 
community sample of parents of children with elevated anxi- 
ety symptoms, and within a subsample where the child met 
diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder. Specifically, we 
aimed to provide current data on the frequency and type of 
(i) parental help-seeking, and (ii) professional support fami- 
lies receive to help manage and overcome a child’s anxiety 
difficulties. We also aimed to (iii) provide quantitative data 
on the frequency and type of parental reported barriers and 
facilitators to seeking and accessing professional support for 
their child’s anxiety. Additionally, we set out to explore (iv) 
the child and parent characteristics associated with seeking 
professional help and parent-reported barriers, and (v) dif- 
ferences in parent-reported barriers among those who have 
and those who have not sought professional help. 


Participants were recruited through screening in primary/ 
junior schools in England. To ensure the sample included 
participants from different geographic regions and captured 
a varied demographic profile, we identified a random sample 
of primary/junior schools in England to approach, stratified 
by the Department of Education’s 10 geographic regions and 
the number of children on the roll eligible for free school 
meals. Between May 2016 and May 2017 538 schools were 
invited to participate in the study, and 62 were recruited. 
Recruited schools were from across all 10 geographic 
regions (North–West, North–East, East Midlands, Yorkshire 
and the Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, London 
(outer and inner), East of England, South East, and South 
West), with 22–731 pupils on the school roll, and a mean of 
15.88% (SD 11.51) children eligible for free school meals. 
Schools that were invited but did not participate usually 
did not respond to the invitation (476 schools; > 90%), and 
where schools declined the invitation, the most frequently 
cited reason was a lack of available time. Invited schools 
that did not take part did not differ from recruited schools in 
terms of number of pupils on the school roll or mean number 
of children eligible for free school meals. 
Recruited schools distributed study information and 
anxiety screening questionnaires (Spence Children’s Anxi- 
ety Scale-Parent Version; SCAS-P) to all parents/caregiv- 
ers of children in year groups 3–6 (aged 7–11 years). Par- 
ents/caregivers (hereby referred to as parents) provided 
informed consent and completed the SCAS-P on paper 
or online. Researchers then visited the school to adminis- 
ter corresponding questionnaires with the children whose 
parents had provided consent, and their class teachers. In 
total, parents of 10,338 children were invited to take part, 
1884 provided consent, and 1881 parents, 1617 children and 
1579 teachers completed screening questionnaires. In cases 
where screening questionnaire scores indicated the child 
had elevated anxiety symptoms,1 the parent was invited 
to take part in a follow-up diagnostic assessment (Anxiety 
1 We used published cut-off scores on the SCAS-P and a subset of 
items on the teacher questionnaire (SCAS-T-8) to identify families to 
follow-up. Both measures display a good-acceptable level of accuracy 
in identifying children with anxiety disorders [21]. 



Disorder Interview Schedule-Parent Version; ADIS-P) and 
to complete follow-up questionnaire measures relating to 
their child’s anxiety (Child Anxiety Impact Scale-Parent 
Version; CAIS-P), their views and experiences surround- 
ing seeking professional help for their child’s anxiety and 
their own mental health (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales; 
DASS-21) and mental health service use. Diagnostic assess- 
ments were administered by telephone, and follow-up ques- 
tionnaires were posted to parents and returned in a pre-paid 
envelope. We invited parents of 639 children with elevated 
anxiety symptoms to take part in the follow-up, parents of 
255 children agreed to take part, and parents of 222 chil- 
dren both completed the diagnostic assessment and returned 
the help-seeking questionnaire. Child anxiety symptoms 
(SCAS-P) were significantly higher among parents who took 
part in the follow-up, than those who were invited but did 
not participate (t [634] = 3.74, p < 0.001). 

The sample included parents of 222 children aged 7–11 years 
with elevated anxiety symptoms, 138 children of whom met 
DSM-5 criteria for at least one anxiety disorder. Participant 
characteristics for the total sample and the subsample are 
provided in Table 1. Across the total sample the majority of 
parents who participated were female (n = 206, 92.8%), with 
a mean age of 40.46 years (SD 5.92), and 99 (44.6%) com- 
pleted higher education. Children had a mean age of 9.63 
(SD 1.22), and 107 (48.2%) were female. Among children 
with an anxiety disorder, 58 (42.0%) children had 2 or more 
anxiety diagnoses, and the most common anxiety disorders 
were Generalised Anxiety Disorder (n = 87, 63.0%), Social 
Anxiety Disorder (n = 52, 37.7%), Specific Phobia (n = 34, 
24.6%) and Separation Anxiety Disorder (n = 31, 22.5%). 
Non-anxiety comorbid disorders were Obsessive Compul- 
sive Disorder (n = 8, 5.8%), Attention Deficit and/or Hyper- 
activity Disorder (ADHD; n = 17, 12.3%), and Oppositional 
Defiant Disorder (ODD; n = 2, 1.4%); an additional 6 chil- 
dren who did not meet criteria for an anxiety disorder had 
behavioural disorders (ADHD, n = 4; ODD, n = 2). 

Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale—parent‑, child‑, 
and teacher‑report versions (SCAS‑P; SCAS‑C‑27; 
SCAS‑T‑20) 
The Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale is a well-evaluated 
38-item questionnaire measure designed to assess symp- 
toms of DSM child anxiety disorders, with parent- and 
child-reported versions [19–24]. To reduce administration 
time, the obsessive compulsive behaviours and physical 
injury fears subscales were not included in the child-reported 
questionnaire, on the basis of the DSM5 classification of 
anxiety disorders and item functioning analyses [21]. A cor- 
responding teacher-reported version of the SCAS that con- 
sists of 20 items derived from the SCAS-C/P (SCAS-T-20) 
[21] was also used. 
Anxiety disorder interview schedule: parent version 
(ADIS‑P) 
The ADIS-P is a reliable and valid structured parent inter- 
view designed to assess a child’s diagnostic status, includ- 
ing an assessment of DSM anxiety diagnoses and common 
comorbid disorders [25–27]. Minor amendments were made 
to enable diagnoses consistent with DSM5 following per- 
sonal communication with the authors. As per the guide- 
lines, diagnoses and Clinical Severity Ratings (CSRs) 4–8 
were assigned where the child met the diagnostic criteria, 
and the disorder with the highest CSR was assigned as the 
primary disorder. Assessments were administered by gradu- 
ate and undergraduate psychology students, and for each 
assessor the first 20 assessments were discussed with an 
experienced diagnostician and consensus reached. After a 
minimum of 20 assessments, and once assessors obtained 
a minimum kappa/ICC of 0.85, then one in six subsequent 
interviews were discussed. Inter-rater reliability within the 
assessment team was excellent (diagnoses, kappa = 0.91, 
CSR ICC = 0.95). 

The CAIS-P is a 27-item parent-reported questionnaire 
measure of the impact of a child’s anxiety symptoms on 
school, social and home/family activities, with good psycho- 
metric properties [28, 29]. Two items considered inappro- 
priate for pre-adolescent children (going on a date, having a 
boyfriend/girlfriend) were omitted. 

This questionnaire measure was developed for this study and 
provided information on the following: 
(i) Parental help-seeking and professional support 
received for their child’s anxiety difficulties. These ques- 
tions were based on questions used in the National survey of 
mental health in children and young people in Great Britain 
[7]. Parents were asked (i) if they had ever contacted a pro- 
fessional for help or advice about their child’s difficulties 
with anxiety, and if so to indicate the professional/s they 
contacted; and (ii) if their child had ever received support 
from a professional to help manage or overcome their child’s 
difficulties with anxiety, and if so to indicate the type of 
support received and who provided the support. To assess

informal help-seeking, parents were asked to indicate other 
people they had spoken to for help or advice about (i) their 
child’s anxiety, and (ii) getting support from a professional 
to help with their child’s anxiety. 
(ii) Parental perceived need for professional support for 
their child’s anxiety. Parents were asked to rate the extent to 
which they felt (i) their child may benefit from professional 
support, and (ii) the parent may benefit from support from a 
professional to help their child manage/overcome their dif- 
ficulties with anxiety. 
(iii) Parent-perceived barriers and facilitators to seeking 
and accessing professional support for their child’s anxi- 
ety difficulties. Parents rated the extent to which 44 items 
stopped/made it harder for them to seek/access professional 
support. Items were rated on a 4-point Likert scale (not 
stopped/not made it harder = 0 to very much stopped/made 
it very much harder = 3). In cases where the parent reported 
contacting a professional for help or advice, parents also 
rated the extent to which 30 items encouraged/made it easier 
for them to seek/access professional support for their child’s 
difficulties with anxiety. Facilitator items were also rated 
on a 4-point scale (not encouraged/not made it easier = 0 to 
very much encourage/made it very much easier = 3). Barrier 
and facilitator items were developed based on findings from 
a systematic review of parental perceived barriers/facilita- 
tors to child mental health treatment [13] and qualitative 
interviews with parents of children with anxiety disorders 
[18]; and refined and finalised following consultation and 
piloting with members of a local research advisors group 
comprising of parents of children who have experienced 
mental health difficulties. Responses to all barrier/facilita- 
tor items were summed to produce total scores. Barriers and 
facilitators relate to four distinct stages in the help-seeking 
process identified in underpinning qualitative work (recog- 
nising a child’s anxiety difficulties; recognising the need for 
professional support; contacting professionals; receiving 
support) [18], and items related to each stage were summed 
to produce four respective barrier/facilitator subscale scores. 

The DASS-21 [30, 31] is a brief self-report questionnaire 
that was used to measure parents’ symptoms of anxiety, 
depression and stress. 

Parents were asked if they had spoken to a professional about 
their own mental health using an item sourced from similar 
surveys [15, 32]. Where applicable, parents also indicated 
the professional they had spoken to and rated the helpful- 
ness of the support they received (not at all helpful = 0 to 
extremely helpful = 4). 




Parental help-seeking, support received, and parent-reported 
barriers were examined within the total sample, and within 
the subsample where the child met criteria for an anxi- 
ety disorder. The number and proportion of parents who 
reported seeking professional help for their child’s anxiety 
difficulties were calculated, together with the number/pro- 
portion who reported seeking help from school staff, Gen- 
eral Practitioners (GPs), mental health specialists, and other 
non-professionals. Similarly, the number and proportion of 
parents who reported that their child received professional 
support were calculated, together with the type of support 
(CBT, counselling, parenting support, recommended strate- 
gies/resources) and professional who provided the support 
[teacher/school staff, GP, National Health Service (NHS) 
mental health specialist, private professional, other profes- 
sional]. In relation to parent-reported barriers, the number/ 
proportion who endorsed each barrier (and 95% CI), mean 
item score (and 95% CI) for each barrier, total barriers score, 
and four barrier subscale scores were examined. Among par- 
ents who reported seeking professional help for their child’s 
anxiety, corresponding descriptive statistics were examined 
for parent-reported facilitators. 

Characteristics associated with parental help-seeking were 
then examined. Bivariate analyses (independent t test, X2 
test) were used to explore whether the following child/par- 
ent characteristics were associated with seeking professional 
help or not: demographic variables (child’s age, child’s gen- 
der, parent education, parent occupation), child’s anxiety 
symptoms/associated impairment (SCAS-P and CAIS-P), 
parent-perceived need for professional support for their 
child, parental mental health (DASS-21), and parental use 
of mental health services/rated helpfulness of mental health 
services. A logistic regression model was then used to exam- 
ine the unique contribution of individual parent/child char- 
acteristics in identifying whether parents had sought pro- 
fessional help for the child’s anxiety or not across the total 
sample. Parent/child characteristics that were significantly 
associated with seeking professional help in the bivariate 
analyses, together with presence/absence of a child anxi- 
ety disorder were entered into the logistic regression model 
using a block-enter method. 

Bivariate analyses (Pearson’s r, X2 test) were also used 
to explore child/parent characteristics associated with 

parent-reported barriers (total barrier scores and barrier 
subscale scores), and independent t tests were used to exam- 
ine differences in parent-reported barriers between parents 
who had sought professional support and those who had 
not. A logistic regression model was used to further explore 
whether particular barriers were uniquely associated with 
seeking/not seeking help (i.e., to determine whether some 
barriers deter parents from contacting professionals, and oth- 
ers become relevant following contact with professionals). 
To explore particularly pertinent barriers, for each subscale 
the first and second rank-ordered barriers (based on the pro- 
portion of parents who endorsed the item) were used as pre- 
dictor variables, and whether the parent had sought help/not 
sought help as the outcome variable. Barrier scores for the 
first and second rank ordered barriers for each subscale were 
entered into the logistic regression model using a block-enter 
method to identify the unique contribution of individual bar- 
riers in identifying whether parents had sought help or not. 
To control for the presence/absence of an anxiety diagnosis 
and demographic variables that were significantly associated 
with parent-reported barriers in bivariate analyses, these var- 
iables were also included in the model. VIF and tolerance 
statistics were examined for evidence of multicollinearity in 
regression models.2 

Frequency and type of help‑seeking and support 
received 
Parent-reported help-seeking and support received to 
help with their child’s anxiety difficulties are displayed in 
Table 2. Almost two-thirds (64.5%) of parents of children 
with an anxiety disorder reported contacting a professional 
for help or advice, and just over half (52.7%) of parents in 
the total sample reported contacting a professional. The 
majority of parents who sought help contacted school staff 
(58.7% of parents of a child with an anxiety disorder; 47.3% 
in the total sample), and a smaller proportion contacted a GP 
(37.7%/27.7%, respectively), someone specialising in mental 
health (27.5%/21.0%, respectively) or another professional 
(13.0%/9.9%, respectively). Interestingly, almost all parents 
2 There was no evidence of multicollinearity in the regression model 
examining the contribution of individual child/parent characteristics 
in identifying help-seekers/non help-seekers. Tolerance statistics for 
two barrier items (It is difficult to get a referral to a specialist ser- 
vice, There are long waiting times for specialist services) indicated 
possible multicollinearity in the regression model examining the con- 
tribution of individual barriers. This logistic regression was repeated 
including only one of these items (It is difficult to get a referral to 
a specialist service) and the results were consistent with the original 
model so only the original regression model is reported here.

(> 90%) across the whole sample reported some informal 
help-seeking and had spoken to someone for help or advice 
about their child’s anxiety. Almost three-quarters (73.5%) of 
parents of children with anxiety disorders, and 60.4% across 
the total sample, also reported seeking informal advice spe- 
cifically about getting professional support for their child. 
In relation to receiving professional support, 38.4% of 
parents of children with an anxiety disorder (and 32.4% 
across the total sample) reported that their child had received 
some type of support from a professional to help manage 
or overcome anxiety difficulties. Families received a range 
of types of professional support, including child counsel- 
ling (14.5% of children with anxiety disorders; 12.2% across 
the total sample), professionals recommending resources/ 
strategies (15.2%/13.1%, respectively), and parenting sup- 
port (8.7%/6.8%, respectively). Notably, only 2.3% of par- 
ents across the total sample reported that their child had 
received CBT. Parents most frequently reported receiv- 
ing professional support from school staff (21.7% of par- 
ents of children with an anxiety disorder, 18.9% across the 
total sample), followed by NHS mental health specialists 
(15.2%/13.1%, respectively). 

Parent-reported barriers across the total sample, and among 
those where the child met criteria for an anxiety disorder are 
displayed in Table 3. Mean total barrier scores were 36.95 
(SD 25.15) in the total sample, and 43.39 (SD 24.93) among 
parents of children with anxiety disorders. 

The most frequently endorsed barriers to recognising a 
child’s anxiety difficulties, were my child’s anxiety comes 
and goes in phases (73.2% of parents of children with an 
anxiety disorder; 68.9% across the total sample) and I’m 
not sure if my child’s anxiety is normal (69.6% of parents 
of children with an anxiety disorder; 63.5% across the total 
sample). Notably, less than a third (across both the total sam- 
ple and those with a child with an anxiety disorder) endorsed 
I don’t know other people who have had anxiety difficulties 
as a barrier. 
anxiety may improve without professional help, I want us to 
manage my child’s anxiety as a family, and I feel a sense of 
failure or blame as a parent as barriers. Notably, only one- 
fifth of the sample endorsed professionals can’t help with 
anxiety difficulties in children as a barrier. 

I don’t know what help is available for children with anxi- 
ety difficulties and I don’t know who to ask for help were 
the most frequently endorsed barriers to contacting profes- 
sionals (72.5%/64.5%, respectively, among parents of chil- 
dren with anxiety disorders; and 67.6%/55.0%, respectively, 
across the total sample). 

In relation to accessing or obtaining professional support to 
help manage and overcome a child’s difficulties, more than 
half of all parents rated it is difficult to get a referral to a 
specialist service, there are long waiting times for specialist 
services, I can’t afford to pay for private professional help, 
and it is a battle to access professional help as barriers; and 
almost two-thirds (64.5%) of parents with anxiety disorders 
endorsed the barriers related to referral difficulties and wait- 
ing times. 

Table 4 displays reported facilitators among those parents 
who had contacted a professional for help or advice about 
their child’s anxiety. More than 80% of parents who had 
sought help rated my child’s anxiety got worse, my child’s 
anxiety impacts on his/her life and I am desperate to get help 
for my child as encouraging them or making it easier for 
them to seek professional help. The majority of help-seekers 
(> 80%) also endorsed the facilitators I trust the teachers 
at my child’s school and Teachers at my child’s school are 
understanding and supportive. In relation to receiving pro- 
fessional support, parents most frequently endorsed facilita- 
tors related to parental effort (I have not given up asking for 
help, 61.5%; I have pushed hard to get professional help for 
my child, 51.3%). 


The most commonly endorsed barrier to recognising the 
need for professional support was I don’t want my child to 
think she/he has a problem (68.8% of parents of children 
with anxiety disorders; 63.5% across the total sample). 
More than half of parents across the whole sample also 
rated teachers or other professionals have never suggested 
my child would benefit from professional help, my child’s 
Findings from bivariate analyses and a logistic regression 
examining factors associated with parental help-seeking 
are reported in Online Resource 1 and 2, respectively. Par- 
ent-reported child anxiety symptoms (SCAS-P), impact 
of child anxiety (CAIS-P total) and impairment related to 
home/family activities (CAIS-home), were each signifi- 
cantly higher among help-seekers than non-help seekers in

Teacher-reported child anxiety symptoms (SCAS-T-20), 
and parent-reported impairment related to school/social 
activities were also significantly higher among help-seek- 
ers than non-help seekers across the total sample. Across 
the total sample and the anxiety disorder subsample, 
parental perceived need for support for their child, both 
in relation to direct support for their child and support for 
the parent to enable them to help their child, and parent 
self-reported mental health symptoms were each signifi- 
cantly higher among help-seekers than non-help seekers. 
Significantly more help-seekers than non-help seekers 



also reported contact with a mental health specialist for 
their own mental health, among the total sample and the 
anxiety disorder subsample. No significant differences 
were found between help-seekers and non-help seekers 
on demographic variables or parent ratings on the help- 
fulness of the professional support they received for their 
own mental health difficulties. 
Parental perceived need for professional support for their 
child (Odds Ratio 4.23 [95% CI 2.08–8.83]), parents’ own 
contact with a mental health specialist (Odds Ratio 2.63 
[95% CI 1.33–5.19]), and impairment related to home/fami- 
lies activities (Odds Ratio 1.14 [95% CI 1.03–1.27]) were 
each uniquely associated with help-seeking for a child’s anx- 
iety difficulties. Notably, after controlling for other variables, 
parent perceived need for support for themselves to enable 
them to help their child was significantly associated with not 
seeking help for their child’s anxiety difficulties (Odds Ratio 
0.35 [95% CI 0.17–0.73]). Child anxiety symptoms (SCAS- 
P), presence of an anxiety diagnosis and parental mental 
health symptoms (DASS-21) were not uniquely associated 
with parental help-seeking. 

As shown in Online Resource 3, the same variables were 
significantly associated with total barrier scores in the total 
sample and the anxiety disorder subsample. Total barrier 
scores were significantly higher among parents with lower 
educational qualifications; and significantly higher among 
parents who reported contact with a mental health specialist 
for their own mental health compared to those who had not 
had contact with a mental health specialist. Child anxiety 
symptoms (SCAS-P, SCAS-C-27), associated impairment 
(CAIS-P, CAIS-subscales), parental perceived need for 
support for their child, and parent mental health symptoms 
(DASS-21) were also each significantly correlated with total 
barrier scores. 
Parent‑reported barriers associated 
with help‑seeking 
Differences between help-seekers and non-help seekers 
on total barrier and barrier subscale scores are displayed 
in Online Resource 1, and similar patterns were observed 
across the total sample and the anxiety disorder subsample. 
Total barrier scores were significantly higher among par- 
ents who had sought help for their child’s anxiety than those 
who had not sought help. Unsurprisingly, barriers related 
to contacting professionals and receiving support were also 
significantly higher among help-seekers than non-help seek- 
ers; however there were no significant differences between 
these two groups in reported barriers related to recognising 
a child’s anxiety difficulties and recognising the need for 
professional support. 
As shown in Online Resource 4, individual barriers 
related to recognising a child’s anxiety difficulty did not 
make a unique contribution in identifying help-seekers/non- 
help seekers (my child’s anxiety comes and goes in phases, 
I’m not sure if my child’s anxiety is normal), and nor did 
barriers related to a lack of knowledge surrounding help- 
seeking (I don’t know who to ask for help, I don’t know what 
help is available for children with anxiety difficulties). Two 
barriers related to recognising the need for support however 
were negatively associated with seeking professional help 
(my child’s anxiety may improve without professional help, 
odds ratio, 0.60 [95% CI 0.40–0.89]; teachers or other pro- 
fessionals have never suggested my child would benefit from 
professional help, odds ratio, 0.57 [95% CI 0.40–0.82]). In 
contrast, the parent-reported barrier related to difficulty get- 
ting a referral to a specialist service was positively asso- 
ciated with seeking professional help (odds ratio, 2.36 
[95% CI 1.28–4.35]). After controlling for these frequently 
endorsed barriers, the presence of an anxiety diagnosis was 
also associated with help-seeking (odds ratio 3.12 [95% CI 
1.52–6.43]). 


This study aimed to provide current and more detailed infor- 
mation on help-seeking for child anxiety difficulties than 
previously reported. Our findings illustrate a substantial 
unmet need in relation to child anxiety. We found that more 
than 60% of children with anxiety disorders had not received 
any professional support to help manage and overcome their 
difficulties with anxiety, and in about one third of cases par- 
ents had not sought help from a professional. Parents who 
had sought help, usually spoke to a member of school staff; 
and families who received professional support reported 
a range of support, but only a very small minority (< 3%) 
reported that their child had received evidence-based treat- 
ment (CBT). Indeed, while there is evidence that 50–60% 
of pre-adolescent children recover from anxiety disorders 
without treatment over a 2–3 year period [2, 33], even those 
children who recover without treatment are at an estimated 
50% increased risk for poor functioning in adulthood [34]. 
Importantly, our findings show that factors other than a 
child’s level of need are the most important determinants 
of seeking help for child anxiety difficulties. Consistent 
with the broader literature surrounding child mental health 
service use [14], we found that parents who perceived that 
their child may benefit from professional support were 
more likely to have sought help than those who did not 



perceive a need for help, but interestingly, after control- 
ling for other child and parent factors, parents who had 
not sought help were more likely to perceive that they 
themselves may benefit from professional support than 
those who had sought help for their child. One possible 
interpretation of this finding is that many parents may 
feel they would benefit from some support, but this is 
not enough to prompt actual help-seeking behaviour; or 
it may relate to a belief that seeking professional help for 
a child’s anxiety may facilitate access to direct support 
for a child rather than for a parent. In line with previous 
studies, our findings also indicate that parents’ own mental 
health plays a role in help-seeking for child anxiety [14, 
15], but we found that it was parents’ prior use of mental 
health services, not their mental health symptoms, that was 
uniquely associated with help-seeking for a child. We did 
not find evidence that parents’ perceptions surrounding the 
helpfulness of their mental health support was associated 
with help-seeking for their child, but it is possible this is 
a reflection of the limited variability in perceived helpful- 
ness reported in this sample. 
We also set out to establish parents’ own views on bar- 
riers/facilitators to seeking and accessing support for child 
anxiety difficulties. Our findings support previous evidence 
that parental perceptions of a child’s mental health difficul- 
ties are an important determinant of parental help-seeking 
[14], and this study illustrates particular difficulties parents 
commonly face identifying anxiety problems in children. 
The majority of parents of children with elevated anxiety, 
including those where the child met diagnostic criteria, 
reported barriers related to differentiating between devel- 
opmentally appropriate and clinically significant anxiety in 
children. This echoes previous qualitative findings [18] that 
indicate that uncertainty about whether a child’s anxiety 
is normal or not related to the fact that anxiety is a com- 
mon childhood experience and can be readily attributed to a 
child’s temperament, and therefore presents a key, anxiety- 
specific help-seeking barrier. Our findings also highlight 
the key role primary school staff play in relation to parental 
help-seeking for child anxiety, with many parents citing a 
failure of teachers or other professionals to suggest a child 
needs help as a barrier, and the vast majority of help-seek- 
ers endorsing trustworthy and/or understanding teachers as 
facilitators. Parents also frequently experienced a range of 
other barriers that made them hesitant or reluctant to seek 
professional support. Interestingly, although negative views 
surrounding the effectiveness of mental health treatment 
are cited as a parent-reported barrier elsewhere [18], only 
a minority of parents in this study endorsed professionals 
can’t help with anxiety difficulties in children as a barrier. 
Rather, concerns surrounding negative consequences for 
the child, specifically: not wanting their child to think they 
have a problem; a belief the anxiety may improve without 
professional help; a desire to manage the difficulties as a 
family; and feeling a sense of blame as a parent, more fre- 
quently deterred parents from seeking professional support. 
A lack of help-seeking knowledge is reported elsewhere as a 
barrier to parental help-seeking [18], and we similarly found 
that many parents considered a lack of knowledge about who 
to ask for help and what help is available as barriers in the 
context of child anxiety. Parents commonly reported barri- 
ers related to limited service provision, including long wait- 
ing times and referral difficulties; and the level of parental 
effort required to get help was also apparent, with parents not 
giving up and pushing hard to get help the most frequently 
reported facilitators related to accessing support. 
The findings also indicate that particular barriers deter 
or prevent parents from seeking help from professionals; 
and additional barriers tend to become relevant after par- 
ents contact professionals, and make it hard for families 
to access support. It is therefore not surprising that help- 
seekers reported more barriers than non-help seekers, and 
other variables associated with help-seeking were also 
associated with parent-reported barriers (child’s symptoms 
and impairment, parental perceived need for help, parental 
mental health symptoms and mental health service use); 
indicating that barriers accumulate as a parent progresses 
through the help-seeking process. In particular, we found 
that parents who had sought help were more likely to report 
barriers related to limited service provision than those who 
had not sought help. Some recognition barriers were com- 
mon across help-seekers and non-help seekers, such as the 
transient nature of the child’s anxiety, and uncertainty about 
whether the anxiety is normal or not. However, parents who 
had not sought help were more likely to report the absence 
of professional recognition of the child’s need for help and 
a belief that a child’s anxiety may improve without profes- 
sional help as barriers, suggesting these are particularly per- 
tinent deterrents to help-seeking. 

This study focused on parental help-seeking specifically in 
the context of anxiety in pre-adolescent children, and by 
doing so identified areas to target to promote help-seeking 
and access to support within this population where anxi- 
ety disorders typically first emerge and the role of parents 
is paramount. Using standardised assessments to identify 
children in the community with elevated anxiety, and those 
who met diagnostic criteria, we were able to establish bar- 
riers experienced by families who do not seek professional 
help, and those who seek help but do not successfully access 
it. Moreover, we used findings from underpinning qualita- 
tive work to develop the questionnaire instrument to help 
ensure we captured barriers/facilitators relevant to parents 
of children with anxiety disorders in the community. Indeed, 



many of the barriers in this study were endorsed by a larger 
proportion of parents than observed in other studies [13], 
indicating that we did capture barriers/facilitators pertinent 
to parents who have and have not sought professional help. 
We acknowledge this study has several limitations. We 
relied on parent report to collect information on help-seeking 
and support accessed by families and it is possible this may 
have resulted in either under- or over-estimating frequencies 
of help-seeking/support accessed. It is also possible that there 
was participation bias in the study, both at the school and 
family level. Participation rates in the initial screening stage 
of the study were relatively low, with a response rate of 11.5% 
among schools and 18.2% among families. Schools with an 
awareness of anxiety difficulties in children may have been 
more likely to respond to the invitation and participate; and 
therefore we may not have captured the experiences of fami- 
lies in schools where there is the least support in place to facil- 
itate help-seeking and access to anxiety support. Although 
we did not target parents of children with anxiety difficulties 
in the initial screening stage, it is possible that these families 
were more likely to participate, and the proportion of children 
screened who met diagnostic criteria and were included in the 
study was slightly higher than the estimated prevalence rates 
for child anxiety disorders (7.3% compared to 6.5%) [35]. 
Parents who had some concerns about their child’s anxiety 
may also have been more likely to take part in the follow-up 
study, and as a result we may not have fully represented the 
experiences of families who have not considered that their 
child may be experiencing difficulties with anxiety. Indeed, 
although it was not possible to assess the level of parental 
concern among those who did not take part in the follow- 
up, parent-reported child anxiety symptoms (SCAS-P) were 
significantly lower among those who were invited but did not 
take part in the follow-up, than those who took part. Also, 
although schools with a varied demographic profile took 
part in the study, families with lower socio-economic status 
and from non-White backgrounds were under-represented 
within the sample, and therefore our findings may not reflect 
help-seeking experiences within these groups. Although we 
worked with individual schools to develop strategies to try to 
maximise participation (e.g., by distributing study informa- 
tion and questionnaires electronically and as paper copies, 
researchers visiting the school to talk to children and school 
staff, offering payments to reimburse schools and participants 
for their time, sending reminders), we did not have sufficient 
resource to support further, targeted activities that may have 
helped improve the representativeness of the sample. 

The study findings identify a number of key areas to tar- 
get to promote both help-seeking and access to professional 
support for child anxiety. In relation to promoting parental 
help-seeking, this study confirmed the widespread need for 
readily accessible tools to help parents make judgements 
about when a child’s anxiety warrants some concern, and 
may benefit from professional support [18]. Moreover, the 
findings further illustrate the need to improve public aware- 
ness and understanding of how to seek professional support 
and the type of professional support that is available for child 
anxiety. In particular, this study highlights the importance of 
targeting negative attitudes and stigma surrounding seeking 
support for child anxiety, both in relation to parents seeking 
support for themselves to enable them to help their child and 
seeking direct support for children; and the need to be sensi- 
tive to the fact that parents without personal experience of 
using mental health services may be less likely to seek sup- 
port for their child. This study also illustrates the particular 
importance of ensuring primary school staff are equipped 
with the skills and resources to enable them to recognise 
anxiety difficulties in children, as well as to provide guidance 
for families on tools, strategies and sources of support avail- 
able. In relation to improving access to professional support, 
our findings also illustrate the need for (i) increased provision 
for child anxiety, (ii) efforts to ensure available support is 
evidence-based, and (iii) services to offer support for parents 
to equip them with the skills to support their children. Given 
that families most commonly seek help and receive support 
through school, further work is needed to develop and evalu- 
ate targeted approaches to identify child anxiety problems 
and deliver evidence-based treatments within school settings. 

This study provides current data on parental help-seeking for 
child anxiety in a community sample from across England. 
Findings identify a substantial unmet need in relation to this 
common child mental health problem. The majority of chil- 
dren (> 60%) had not received any professional support, only 
a very small proportion (< 3%) had received evidence-based 
treatment, and about a third of parents had not sought profes- 
sional help for their child’s anxiety. Our findings illustrate the 
range of barriers to both seeking, and accessing support for 
child anxiety difficulties, and importantly identify keys areas 
to target to improve access to evidence-based child anxiety 
treatment. In particular, the findings identify the need for 
readily available child anxiety identification tools, guidance 
for families and school staff on the help-seeking process, and 
increased evidence-based provision that incorporates direct 
support for parents and is available in school settings.
