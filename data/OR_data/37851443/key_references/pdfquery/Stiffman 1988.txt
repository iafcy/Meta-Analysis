to offer a 
full range of mental and physical health services to 
adolescents. 
the traditional health ser- 
vices provide care based on medical needs such as 
gynecology, pediatrics, and dentistry, and provide 
care for all age ranges from child to adult. 

The two-wave design will allow evaluation of the 
clinics’ awareness and treatment of the problems 
reported by adolescents 
in the first wave, and of the 
impact of these different types of health services on

The adolescents participating were selected for in- 
terviews by the research team in the order that they 
presented 
to the clinics for care. The adolescents 
understood 
that these interviews were totally in- 
dependent of their health care. Whenever possible, 
interviews were completed on site immediately be- 
fore or after a clinic visit. Otherwise, an appointment 
for a future interview was arranged. Postponed 
in- 
terviews were usually completed within a few days 
of the clinic visit either on site or at a location mu-

However, our findings suggest 
that high-risk ado- 
lescents typically do not seek help for these prob- 
lems. The highest rate of help seeking occurred for 
the physical care needs of sexually active females, 
as securing a contraceptive, but even then it 
ot exceed tie thirds. Thus, even in the current 
national climate in which considerable attention 
is 
being given to the prevention of adolescent preg- 
nancy, a substantial number of sexually active girls 
who are in contact with a medical clinic are not ask- 
ing for or being offered contraceptive 
help. Al- 
though considerable variation in help seeking for the 
other four mental health conditions was found, 
in 
each case less ?han half of those identified by the 
interview as having a high-risk condition sought or 
received help. The rates of care for suicide ideation, 
conduct disorder, and substance abuse were partic- 
ularly low, with less than a third of those youths 
identified by the research 
the 
problem seeking or receiving help. 


These less than satisfactory rates of help seeking 
are important, given 
that the sample youths had 
already elected to visit a clinic for some type of help, 
and at least some of them had had multiple clinic 
contacts. This finding suggests

a major problem exists in attracting at-risk males. 

The problems

sion are important because they put youth at a high
