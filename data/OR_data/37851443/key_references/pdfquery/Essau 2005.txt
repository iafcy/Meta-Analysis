FREQUENCY AND PATTERNS OF MENTAL HEALTH 
SERVICES UTILIZATION AMONG ADOLESCENTS WITH 
ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS 


The main aim of this study was to examine the frequency and patterns of mental 
health services utilization among 12- to 17-year-old adolescents with anxiety 
and depressive disorders. Another aim was to examine the factors associated with 
the use of mental health services. The study population comprised 1,035 
adolescents randomly recruited from 36 schools. Anxiety and depressive 
disorders were coded based on DSM-IV criteria using the computerized Munich 
version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Only 18.2% of the 
adolescents who met DSM-IV criteria for anxiety disorders, and 23% of those 
with depressive disorders, used mental health services. Among adolescents with 
anxiety disorders, mental health services utilization was associated with past 
suicide attempt, older age, the presence of comorbid disorders, as well as parental 
anxiety and depression. The only factor that predicts the use of mental health 
service among adolescents with depressive disorder was a history of suicide 
attempt. The implication of the results in terms of tailoring services for children 
and adolescents with anxiety and depressive disorders are discussed. Depression

INTRODUCTION 
Information about the use of mental health services 
among adolescents with anxiety and depressive dis- 
orders is important for a number of reasons: First, 
anxiety and depressive disorders are among the most 
common psychiatric disorders in adolescents, with as 
the adolescents in the general 
many as 20% of 
population reported as having had these disorders 
sometimes in their lives [e.g., Cohen et al., 1993; 
Essau et al., 2000; Lewinsohn et al., 1993, 1997; 
McGee et al., 1990]. Second, anxiety and depressive 
disorders generally co-occur with other disorders such 
as substance use disorders [Cohen et al., 1993; Essau 
et al., 2000; Kashani and Orvaschel, 1990; Keller et al., 
1992; Lewinsohn et al., 1997; McGee et al., 1990]. 
Third, adolescents who have anxiety and depression 
are highly impaired in various life domains, such 
as 
in school, at home, and in social activities 
[Ginsburg et al., 1998; Kashani and Orvaschel, 1990]. 
tend to

follow a chronic course, with a low remission rate 
[Harrington et 
1996; Last 
et al., 1997; Pine et al., 1998]. Finally, the presence of 
anxiety and depressive disorders early in life tends 
to increase a risk of developing other disorders later 
in life.

studies on the 
to the amount of 
epidemiology, comorbidity, and course of anxiety and 
depressive disorders, only a few studies have examined 
the use of mental health services among adolescents 
with these disorders. The few existing studies have 
reported much variation in the use of mental health 
services for anxiety and depressive disorders, which 
may reflect methodological differences or real cultural 
differences among samples, or differences in health 
care systems in different countries. For example, in one 
American study [Whitaker et al., 1990], about half of 
the adolescents with an anxiety disorder have made 
some type of consultation for emotional problems from 
a general health provider and mental health profes- 
sional. Most of these visits were made by those with 
generalized anxiety disorder (60%) and obsessive–com- 
pulsive disorder (25%), and less frequently by those 
with panic disorder (14%). The rates of mental health 
service utilization reported in other studies were much 
lower than those reported by Whitaker and colleagues. 
In another American study [Keller et al., 1992], only 
24% of the children with anxiety received treatment for 
these anxiety disorders. Of those who sought treat- 
ment, 13% received individual counseling, 5% received 
family counseling, and 5% received psychological 
evaluation (without treatment). In a Canadian study 
[Bowen et al., 1990], almost 16% of the subjects 
had used mental health or 
services, and 
another 10.3% perceived themselves as having had 
emotional or behavioral problems for which profes- 
sional help is or was needed. In a study in New Zealand 
[Fergusson et al., 1993], 9% of the children with 
anxiety or mood disorder had used some forms of 
health services for their conditions. The use of health 
services was significantly affected by the presence of 
comorbid disorders, with service utilization rates 
increasing significantly with the increased number of 
comorbid disorders. 

The rates for mental health services utilization for 
adolescent depression also differed across studies, with 
rates ranging from 15% to 65% [Cuffe et al., 1995; 
Goodman et al., 1997; Offord et al., 1987]. In a study 
by Lewinsohn et al. [1998], 60% of the adolescents 
who met the diagnosis of a major depression had 
received any mental health treatment. The most 
commonly used treatment was individual outpatient 
psychotherapy (60.1%). Inpatient treatment was rare, 
and was generally given to those whose depression co- 
occurred with substance use disorders. Mental health 
services utilization was significantly associated with the 
presence of comorbid mental disorders, a history of 
suicide attempt, academic problems, a nonintact family, 
female gender, severity of depression, and the number 
of previous depressive episodes. Nine percent received 
pharmacotherapy, mostly antidepressant (4.2%) and 
antianxiety (3.7%) medication. 
Because most of these studies have been conducted in 
the United States [Keller et al., 1992; Whitaker et al., 
1990], Canada [Bowen et al., 1990], and New Zealand 

[Fergusson et al., 1993], they cannot be regarded as 
representative of services utilization among adolescents 
with anxiety and depressive disorders in other countries 
due to reasons discussed earlier (e.g., methodological 
differences, real cultural differences, and differences in 
health care systems). In Germany, for example, the 
history of the modern German health care system can 
be traced back to Bismarck and his initiative to provide 
social security independent of socioeconomic status. 
The statutory health insurance occupies a central 
position in the health care system in the Federal 
Republic of Germany. At present, about 88% of the 
population is covered by the statutory health insurance 
[European Observatory on Health Care Systems, 
2000]. About 9% are covered by private health 
insurance, 2% by free governmental health care (e.g., 
police officers, 
the 
population is not insured. Individuals’ contributions 
to the health insurance are dependent on their income, 
and are shared on an equal basis by the insured and 
their employers. Included in the health care benefits 
package are prevention, screening, and treatment of 
diseases (medical, psychiatric, dental, psychotherapy), 
as well as transportation to the hospitals or outpatient 
clinics. As a result, comprehensive health care for the 
population is guaranteed. Another important feature of 
the German health care system, unlike many health 
care systems around the world, is that it is not based on 
a gatekeeper system; that is, the patients have the right 
to select and to go directly to any health professional 
they wish to receive help or treatment. A referral from a 
general practitioner as a prerequisite for a visit to 
a specialist 
(including a clinical psychologist or 
psychiatrist) is not needed. All medical matters, and 
matters 
the 
jurisdiction of 
lobby (Kassena¨rztliche 
Vereinigung), which acts as a mediator between the 
Federal Ministry of Health and the health insurance 
companies, as well as between the insured persons 
and the health insurance companies. In the current 
related to 
reimbursement 
psychodynamic therapy/psychoanalysis 
(since 1970) 
and cognitive-behavioral or behavioral therapy (since 
1981) can be reimbursed from the health insurance 
companies. 



If more effective service systems are to be developed, 
it is important to have information regarding where 
adolescents with anxiety and depression receive mental 
health services. Furthermore, we need to know the 
extent to which those in greatest need of these services 
actually receive treatment. Therefore, the main aims of 
this study were to address the following questions: 
(1) How frequently did adolescents with anxiety 
and depressive disorders seek mental health services? 
(2) Of those who sought help, what type of treatment 
was received? (3) What factors were related to mental 
health utilization? (4) Was 
there any association 
between mental health services and the stability of 
anxiety and depressive disorders? 




Participants were adolescents, ages 12 to 17 years, 
who were randomly selected from 36 high schools in 
the province of Bremen, Germany. The study is a 
longitudinal, 
large-scale, community-based study of 
the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders among 
adolescents [Essau et al., 1998, 1999a,b]. The specific 
aims of the study are to estimate the frequency, risks, 
course, and outcome of psychiatric disorders, 
to 
determine age of onset and severity, and to examine 
the comorbidity patterns of disorders and associated 
impairment, as well as service utiliza- 
psychosocial 
tion patterns. 
Permission to conduct the study in the schools was 
granted by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of 
‘‘Confidentality’’ (in German: Landesbeaufragter fu¨r den 
Datenschutz), and the ethics committees 
in each 
participating school. Schools were selected to ensure 
nationally representative estimates for each grade, and 
classes were selected from the target grade using simple 
random sampling. All students in a selected class were 
asked to participate, with active parental and student 
written consent. 
Data collection for the first wave of the study took 
place between May 1996 and July 1997. Details about 
the study´s design, sample, and characteristic have been 
described elsewhere [Essau et al., 2000, 2001]. Alto- 
gether 2,300 students 
in the 36 schools were 
approached to participate in the study; the number of 
students approached in each individual school varied 
due to organization (e.g., tight schedule, lack of room 
to conduct the interview) and political issues (e.g., lack 
of interest or support from teachers) in some schools. 
A total of 1,444 adolescents agreed to participate; 
however, data of 1,035 students were used in this 
analysis. Data of 197 adolescents were excluded 
because they did not fulfill the age criteria (they were 
younger than 12 years or older than 17 years; N 5 87), 
or had too many missing or problematic data points 
(N 5 110). In addition, 79 students wanted to partici- 
pate but were unable to do so due to being sick or on 
holiday, or were not allowed by their teachers to parti- 
cipate due to tight academic schedules in their class; 
another 133 students were unable to obtain a signed 
consent form from their parent or guidance counselor. 
Thus, the response rate for the present study was 62.8%. 
Of the 1,035 adolescents with a complete data set, 
421 were males and 614 were females. The average 
age was 14.3 years (SD 5 1.7). Almost all of 
the 
adolescents were living at home with at least one of 
their parents. About an average of 15 months after the 
first interview (T1), attempts were made to contact 
(via telephone and mail) all the 1,035 adolescents to 
participate in the follow-up investigation, of whom 760 
could be reached. A total of 240 adolescents could not 
be contacted either by telephone (up to 10 attempts) or 
by mail (e.g., unknown new address), and 35 adoles-

cents were not in Bremen during the whole of the 
follow-up period: Six were on an exchange program 
overseas and 29 had moved to other German cities. 
One hundred thirty-eight students refused to take part, 
mostly due to lack of time. Among those who agreed to 
participate (N 5 622) in the T2 interview, 566 actually 
were interviewed. No interview could be made for 61 
adolescents due to organizational problems, such as 
being sick or on holiday. Data of 43 adolescents had to 
be excluded due to ‘‘problematic’’ or missing data. 
Therefore, data of 523 adolescents formed the database 
for the T2 interview. Of these adolescents, 195 were 
males and 328 were females, with a mean age of 15.2 
years (SD 5 1.7). The attrition and nonattrition groups 
did not differ significantly on age and gender, as well as 
on parental marital and socioeconomic status. 

Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) of 
the 
Munich version of the Composite International Diagnostic 
Interview (CIDI). Anxiety (agoraphobia, social phobia, 
specific phobia, panic disorder, generalized anxiety 
disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive– 
compulsive disorder), depressive, and other psychiatric 
disorders (substance use and somatoform disorders) 
were coded based on DSM-IV criteria [American 
Psychiatric Association, 1994] using the CAPI [Wittch- 
en and Pfister, 1997] of the Munich version of the 
CIDI. The CAPI, a modified version of the CIDI, is a 
fully structured diagnostic interview developed as a 
collaborative project between the World Health 
Organization and the U.S. Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and 
Mental Health Administration. 
The CAPI also contains questions related to parental 
the presence of psychiatric 




syndromes in students’ parents). Reports of parental 
psychopathology were obtained from the adolescents. 
the CIDI 
diagnoses have been examined in numerous studies in 
different centers throughout the world as part of the 
World Health Organization field trials of the CIDI. 
Findings of these field trials have shown the CIDI to 
have good cultural appropriateness, excellent interrater 
reliability, and good test–retest reliability [Wittchen 
et al., 1991]. The test–retest reliability of the CAPI has 
also been examined in a sample of 60 community 
adolescents and young adults [Wittchen and Pfister, 
1997]. With the exception of generalized anxiety 
disorder (k 5 .45), the k values of the other anxiety 
disorders were all above .72. The test–retest reliability 
for age of onset and time-related questions was also 
high, with intraclass correlation values of .79 or above. 
The validity of the CAPI has been examined in young 
adults recruited from a psychiatric hospital. The 
concordance between clinicians and interview for 
DSM-IV diagnoses was generally good across dis- 
orders. The k value for any anxiety disorders was .79, 
for posttraumatic stress disorder, .91, for social phobia, 
.80, and for panic disorder, .63. 
Use of mental health services was assessed using the 
mental health services utilization section (section Q) of 
the CAPI. The subjects were asked whether or not they 
had ever sought professional help due to emotional/ 
psychiatric problems or problems related to alcohol/ 
drugs. This question was followed by a list of different 
types of services in which mental health services were 
sought: (1) inpatient setting (e.g., psychiatric clinic, 
neurological clinic, psychotherapeutic clinic, psycho- 
somatic clinic, clinic for alcohol and drug dependence); 
(2) 
or 
psychotherapeutic outpatient services, psychiatric out- 
patient services, different types of counseling services, 
clinical psychologist, 
services); 
(3) general practitioners (only related to the treatment 
of emotional difficulties) and school psychologist; 
self-help groups, 
and (4) other 
telephone services). 










(SCL-90-R). The 
SCL-90-R is a 90-item self-report questionnaire used 
to assess psychological distress [Derogatis, 1977]. Each 
item is rated on a 5-point scale (not at all to extremely) to 
indicate the severity of the symptom over the past 
week. The inventory assesses nine clusters or primary 
symptom dimensions: somatization, obsessive–compul- 
sive behavior, 
sensitivity, depression, 
anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, 
and psychoticism. Although the SCL-90-R was 
it has been used 
originally developed for adults, 
in adolescents and has proved to have good to excellent 
psychometric properties [McGough and Curry, 1992]. 
Both the reliability and validity of the German version 
of the SCL-90-R, when used in adolescents, have been 

reported in an earlier publication [Essau et al., 2001]. 
The internal consistency for all 
the SCL-90-R 
subscales was 
relatively high, with Cronbach’s 
a’s between .64 and .84. Furthermore, adolescents 
the diagnosis of several disorders (e.g., 
who met 
anxiety, depressive, somatoform, and substance use 
disorders) had higher scores on the SCL-90-R than 
those without any of these psychiatric disorders [Essau 
et al., 2001]. 
RESULTS 
FREQUENCY AND PATTERNS OF MENTAL 
HEALTH SERVICES USE AMONG 
ADOLESCENTS WITH ANXIETY AND 
DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS 
Among those with any anxiety disorders (N 5 192), 
only 35 (18.2%) received any mental health treatment 
(Table 1). Within the anxiety disorders, adolescents 
with posttraumatic stress disorder (47.1%) had the 
highest rate of mental health services utilization, 
followed by those with obsessive–compulsive disorder 
(30.8%) and generalized anxiety disorder 
(25%). 
Phobia not otherwise specified (phobia NOS), which 
is a residual category, had the lowest rate of utilization. 
Most treatment was carried out in outpatient settings 
(88.3%), with almost half of the adolescents seeking 
help from school psychologists. Treatment received 
at an inpatient setting was rare: Only 5.9% of the 
setting. 
treatment 
adolescents 
About 5.9% received help from ‘‘other social services,’’ 
such as telephone counseling (e.g., tele-care) and self- 
help group. 


Logistic regression was performed to examine factors 
associated with the use of mental health services among 
adolescents with anxiety and depressive disorders. 
Among adolescents with anxiety disorders, mental 
health services utilization was associated with past 
suicide attempt, parental anxiety, parental depression, 
older age, and the presence of comorbid disorders, but 
not with gender and parental alcohol problems 
(Table 2). The association between the use of mental 
health services and comorbid disorders was interesting; 
that is, the frequency of any mental health services 
increased with the number of comorbid disorders. Ten 
(10.6%) of the pure anxiety cases reported having 
sought mental health services, compared to 16 (22.9%) 
of those with one comorbid disorders, and to nine 
(32.1%) of those with at least two comorbid disorders. 
However, when males and females were analyzed 
separately, the presence of comorbid disorders was 
significantly associated with the use of mental health 
services in anxious males (w2 5 6.60, P 5.037), whereas 
no such association was 
found among females 
(w2 5 3.65, P 5.16). 
Among adolescents with any depressive disorders 
(N 5 185), 23% had received mental health services 







sometime in their lives. The majority of adolescents 
with depression sought mental health services treat- 
ment in the outpatient setting (62%), mostly from 
school psychologists. About 12% had sought treatment 
through other social services. The number of those 
who had received treatment in inpatient settings (19%) 
was higher than that of those with anxiety disorders. 
The only factor significantly associated with mental 
health services utilization was the presence of a past 
suicide attempt (Table 2). 
Because of the frequent comorbidity between anxiety 
and depression, the next step of our analysis was to 
estimate the rates of mental health services use among 
those with pure 
those with lifetime pure anxiety, 
depressive disorders, and those with both disorders. 
As shown in Table 1, mental health services utilization 
was the highest among those with both disorders 
(26.5%), compared to those with pure anxiety (10.6%) 
and with pure depression (18.2%). 

and Mental Health 
Services. The next step of our analysis was to 
compare the level of psychological distress among 
adolescents who had received any mental health 
services with that of adolescents who had not received 
such services. We compared differences between these 
groups of adolescents (i.e., with and without mental 
health services) using one-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA). Group membership (adolescents with 
anxiety or depression, with or without mental health 
services) was used as 
independent variable, and 
psychological distress, as measured by the SCL-90-R, 
was the dependent variable. 
Results showed that among adolescents with anxiety 
disorders, those who sought mental health services, 
compared to those without any treatment, had 
significantly higher scores on psychological distress, 
as measured using the SCL-90-R. As shown in Table 3, 
anxiety cases that received mental health services 
compared to those that did not receive such services 
had significantly higher scores on the global severity 
index [(1, 156) 5 8.08, P o.01], and on the following 
the SCL-90-R: obsessive–compulsive 
subscales of 
behavior 
interpersonal 
sensitivity [F(1, 159) 5 11.20, P o.01]; depression 
[F(1, 159) 5 13.75, P o.001]; anger–hostility [F(1, 
159) 5 6.48, P o.05]; paranoid ideation [F(1, 159) 5 
17.37, P o.001]; and psychoticism [F(1, 159) 5 7.99, 
P o.05]. 

Similar results were also obtained for adolescents 
with depressive disorders; that is, those who received 
mental health services had significantly higher scores 
on the global severity index [(1, 153) 5 7.74, P o.01], 
and on the various SCL-90-R subscales compared to 
depressed adolescents who did not use mental health 
interpersonal sensitivity [F(1, 156) 5 10.78,

anxiety [F(1, 156) 5 4.84, P o.05]; paranoid ideation 
[F(1, 156) 5 5.19, P o.05]; and psychoticism [F(1,

Impact of Mental Health Services on the Course 
of Anxiety and Depression. 
Table 4 shows the 
impact of mental health services utilization on the 
course of anxiety and depression. Among adolescents 
with anxiety and depression at both T1 and T2, a large 
majority did not receive any mental health services; that 
is, only 15.8% of the chronic anxiety cases (i.e., T1 and 
T2) received treatment; 84.3% of the chronic anxiety 
cases had never received mental health services. Among 
adolescents with depression, 36.4% of those who used 
mental health services met the diagnosis of depressive 
disorders at both T1 and T2. There were 36 and 
23 new cases of anxiety and depression, respectively. 
Most of these cases had not received any mental health 
services. 

The main aim of this study has been to examine the 
frequency and patterns of mental health services 


utilization among adolescents with anxiety and depres- 
sive disorders. Before discussing our findings, some 
limitations should be discussed: First, our measure of 
treatment utilization is entirely based on adolescents’ 
self-reports. Reports from other informants, such as 
parents and teachers, would have been desirable. 
However, according to some authors [e.g., Verhulst 
et al., 1989], adolescents’ self-reports tend to be valid 
and reliable. Second, reports of parental psychopathol- 
ogy were obtained from the adolescents themselves, 
which could be influenced by the quality of 
the 
adolescents’ relationship with their parents, and/or by 
the cognitive biases that may be associated with anxiety 
and depression in adolescents. Because parents were 
not directly asked about the presence of psychopathol- 
ogy, we have no way of testing the reliability of this 
information. Third, only about half of the baseline 
samples could be reinvestigated, which influences the 
data on the cause of anxiety and depression. Fourth, the 
number of 
the analyses on factors 
associated with service use is relatively small. Finally, 
some major barriers (e.g., attitudes, location of institu- 
to receiving 
tions offering mental health services) 
treatment were not assessed. These limitations should 
be taken into account when interpreting our findings. 
A total of 18.2% of the adolescents who met the 
lifetime diagnosis of anxiety disorders and 23% of those 
with depression reported having used any mental health 
services. This utilization rate is lower than has been 
reported in some studies [Lewinsohn et al., 1998; 
Whitaker et al., 1990] but seems comparable to others 
[Bowen et al., 1990; Keller et al., 1992]. For example, in 
the Lewinsohn et al. study [1998], 60.7% of 
the 
adolescents with major depression had received treat- 
ment. This difference may reflect not only methodolo- 
gical differences but also real cultural differences among 
the samples, and differences in the health care systems 
for these various countries. The low rate of mental health 
utilization found in our study was surprising because of 
the comprehensive coverage and the non-gatekeeper 
system in the German health system. Unfortunately, no 
questions were asked about the reasons related to low 
rate of mental health services utilization in this study. 
However, 
it could be that stigmatization may have 
accounted for the low use of mental health services. 

In our study, most treatment was carried out in 
outpatient settings, with almost half of the adolescents 
seeking help from school psychologists. Similar to the 
findings reported by Lewinsohn et al. [1998], inpatient 
study. The 
treatment was 
Methods of the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent 
Mental Disorders [MECA study; Leaf et al., 1996] has 
similarly reported a high number of youth with serious 
emotional and behavioral problems in schools. This 
finding has two important implications: First, there is a 
need to have a close collaboration with school-based 
professionals such as teachers and school psychologists. 
Second, since only a small proportion of adolescents 
with any anxiety and depressive disorders received

professional help for their disorders, it is important to 
provide a prevention program that could reach the 
largest number of children before they reach the age at 
which the peak risk occurs for developing these 
disorders. It is through a well-developed preventive 
strategy that the stress experienced by children and 
their families, as well as 
the negative long-term 
consequences of anxiety and depressive disorders, can 
be prevented. As shown in recent studies by Barrett and 
her colleagues [Barrett and Turner, 2001; Barrett et al., 
2003; Lowry-Webster et al., 2001], 
the use of a 
preventive program based on cognitive-behavioral 
principles can successfully prevent the development 
of anxiety and depression in children. 
The only factor significantly associated with treat- 
ment among adolescents with depressive disorder was a 
history of suicide attempt. Unlike the Lewinsohn et al. 
[1998] study, gender and the presence of comorbid 
disorders failed to correlate significantly with the use of 
mental health services in our study. The reason for this 
was unclear, perhaps due to methodological differ- 
ences; that is, our samples were much younger than 
those in their study; the subjects in our study were ages 
12–17 years, and in their study, subjects were ages 19 to 
24. As for the comorbid disorders, it is not clear which 
disorders were included under ‘‘nonaffective disorders’’ 
in the Lewinsohn et al. study. In our study, comorbid 
disorders included somatoform, substance use, and 
anxiety disorders. 

seemed to influence the stability of 
anxiety and depression. Among adolescents with 
anxiety and depression at both T1 and T2, a high 
majority did not receive any mental health services. 
In the Lewinsohn et al. study [1998], adolescents who 
received treatment were not less likely to experience a 
new depressive episode at young adulthood. Their 
findings showed that among formerly depressed males 
(but not among females) previous 
treatment was 
associated with greater relapse. 
Among adolescents with anxiety disorders, mental 
health services utilization was associated with past 
suicide attempt, parental anxiety, parental depression, 
and the presence of comorbid disorders. The finding 
that parental anxiety and depression significantly 
predicted the use of services suggested that in addition 
to their own problems 
(e.g., having had suicide 
attempt, high level of distress, and comorbid disor- 
ders), referred adolescents lived in families with stress 
as a result of their parents’ psychopathology. It also 
suggested that parents’ psychopathology may have 
lowered the threshold for reporting the child’s problem 
behavior [Verhulst and van der Ende, 1997]. Our 
finding may also suggest that these parents are not 
equipped to manage problems in their children. Thus, 
in working with children and adolescents with anxiety 
and depressive disorders, 
to tailor 
services provision by taking family characteristics 
(e.g., parental psychopathology) into account.
