A prerequisite for effective service planning is accurate 
information about the extent to which those with men- 
tal disorders receive professional help. This includes 
information about the types of services attended, help 
provided by these services, factors that influence service 
attendance, and barriers to service access. 
Population-based studies have consistently found 
that only a minority of children with mental health 
problems attend specialist mental health services (An- 
gold et al., 1998; Offord et al., 1987; Verhulst and van 
der Ende, 1996). For example, Offord et al. (1987) 
reported that only 16.1% of children with mental dis- 
orders had received help from specialist mental 
health/social services in Ontario, Canada, during the 
previous 6 months. Similarly, in a study of 2,227 chil- 



dren aged 4 to 18 years in the Netherlands, Verhulst 
and van der Ende (1996) reported that only 13% of 
those who scored above the recommended cutoff on 
the Child Behavior Checklist had been referred to 
mental health services during the previous 12 months. 
In a community sample of 1,015 children aged 9, 11, 
and 13 years in North Carolina, Angold et al. (1998) 
found that 40% of those with “serious emotional dis- 
turbance” had received any professional help and 20% 
had received help from specialist mental health services. 
Results from these studies also showed that children 
with mental health problems often receive help from 
services other than specialist mental health services. 
These include school-based services, family practitio- 
ners, pediatricians, and community health services 
(Burns et al., 1995; Cohen et al., 1990). 
There is also evidence that the type of help provided 
for children with mental health problems is changing. 
For example, Hoagwood et al. (2000) used information 
from a national survey of practice-based physicians and 
primary care physicians to compare the treatment be- 
ing provided to children with attention-deficit/hyper- 
activity disorder (ADHD) in 1989 and 1996. They 
reported that, during this period, the frequency of 
stimulant prescriptions increased from 54.8% of visits 
to 75.4%, whereas psychotherapy decreased from 
41.1% of visits to 25.2%. These changes emphasize the 
importance of not assuming that the type of treatment 
provided to children with mental disorders is the same 
in different geographical regions or at different points 
of time. 
A number of studies have investigated factors that 
influence service use. For example, Jensen et al. (1990) 
compared 134 children aged 6 to 12 years who had 
been referred to a military child psychiatry clinic with 
a matched community sample. Parental psychopathol- 
ogy, family size, and marital status were most predictive 
of children’s symptoms, whereas stress levels, family 
size, and marital status were most predictive of service 
use. The authors reported that factors other than chil- 
dren’s symptom levels explained 13.2% of the variance 
in referral rates. Lavigne et al. (1998) investigated the 
use of mental health services by 510 children aged 2 to 
5 years who were attending pediatric practices in Chi- 
cago. They reported that high levels of family conflict 
and a diagnosis of a mental disorder increased the like- 
lihood of referral to a mental health service. There are 
differing reports of the relationship between socioeco- 
nomic status and service attendance. Lavigne et al. 
(1998) and Laitinen-Krispijn et al. (1999) reported 
that service use was not associated with socioeconomic 
status, whereas Burns et al. (1995) reported that pov- 
erty was significantly associated with service use among 
children in North Carolina. 
Although substantial information is available about 
service use by children, most studies have focused on 
children identified as having mental health problems 
based on their scoring above recommended cutoffs on 
behavior checklists rather than based on diagnostic in- 
terviews (Offord et al., 1987; Verhulst and van der 
Ende, 1996). They have also largely used community- 
based convenience samples rather than nationally rep- 
resentative samples. These limitations reduce the 
impact of findings on planning and policy develop- 
ment. Further, most epidemiological data available for 
ADHD are based on DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria so 
that little is known about the use of services by children 
with the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive sub- 
types of ADHD introduced in DSM-IV. 
This study focused on service use by children who 
met symptom criteria for ADHD and who participated 
in a national survey of the prevalence and distribution 
of child and adolescent mental health problems in Aus- 
tralia. ADHD is one of the most common disorders 
experienced by children and adolescents, and it has a 
significant adverse impact on children, families, and 
school communities (Seija, 2002). However, most of 
the information available refers to the combined sub- 
type. There are limited data about the extent to which 
inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive subtypes, although 
dissimilar in their symptoms, actually differ in service 
use and parental perceptions of need for help (Lahey, 
2001). 
Specific aims of this study were (1) to describe the 
percentage of children with each of the three subtypes 
of ADHD attending health or school-based services, 
(2) to describe the type of help being provided for these 
children, and (3) to identify factors that are associated 
with use of these services, including barriers to service 
access. We hypothesized that comorbid depressive and 
conduct disorders, children’s level of impairment, pa- 
rental perceptions of the extent of children’s problems 
and need for professional help, and parental percep- 
tions of the impact of children’s problems on parents 
would each have a significant and independent rela- 
tionship with service attendance. 




The participants were 398 children of the 3,597 children aged 6 
to 17 years who were recruited for the Child and Adolescent Com- 
ponent of the National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being in 
Australia and who met DSM-IV symptom criteria for ADHD. The 
survey methodology has been described in detail elsewhere (Sawyer 
et al., 2000). In brief, the survey used a multistage probability 
sample of 4,509 households to select a representative sample of 
Australian children aged 4 to 17 years (for brevity, the term chil- 
dren will be used to describe both children and adolescents). Be- 
tween February and May 1998, interviewers approached randomly 
selected households, the number chosen being proportional to the 
population of each state or territory. At each household, interview- 
ers obtained informed consent before the interview proceeded. The 
response rate was 70%. 
Parents or primary caregivers completed the parent version of the 
Diagnostic Interview for Children Version IV (DISC-IV) modules 
to identify major depressive disorder (MDD), conduct disorder 
(CD), and ADHD (Shaffer et al., 2000). The 1-year prevalence of 
ADHD was 11.2%, CD was 3.0%, and MDD was 3.7%. Among 
those with ADHD symptoms, 17% also met the criteria for CD 
and 11% met the criteria for MDD. This study focused on service 
use reported by 398 parents of children diagnosed with one of the 
three ADHD subtypes, including those with comorbid CD and 
MDD. 
Ethical approval for the survey was obtained from the Research 
Ethics Committee at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Adelaide. 

Assessment of Disorder. In face-to-face interviews, parents com- 
pleted the parent version of the DISC-IV (Shaffer et al., 2000). The 
DISC-IV is a structured diagnostic interview that can be used by lay 
interviewers. It is designed to diagnose a range of mental disorders 
in children based on DSM-IV criteria. The diagnoses for the current 
study were based on the algorithms recommended to identify chil- 
dren with ADHD (DISC-IV Version H, July 2001). These algo- 
rithms meet the symptom criteria for psychiatric diagnosis according 
to DSM-IV but do not incorporate the impairment criteria. 
Functional Impairment. For children who meet the criteria for a 
diagnosis, the DISC-IV assesses six areas in which children’s symp- 
toms may impair their functioning. These include annoying or 
upsetting caregivers or teachers, interference with school work, peer 
or family activities, and causing distress to the child with the dis- 
order. In each case, caregivers are asked to rate the level of children’s 
impairment at the time during the past year when the child’s symp- 
toms were causing the most problems. Ratings employ 3-point 
scales labeled either “A lot of the time/Some of the time/Hardly 
ever” or “Very bad/Bad/Not too bad.” For the purpose of this 
study, impairment was rated as 0 if the parent reported the child’s 
problem was not causing any problems, 1 if it was rated “not too 
bad/hardly ever,” 2 if it was “bad/some of the time,” and 3 if it as 
“very bad/a lot of the time.” For children with the combined sub- 
type, two ratings are obtained for each of the six areas of impair- 
ment, 
i.e., the six asking about the impact of inattentive 
symptomatology and the six asking about hyperactive/impulsive 
symptomatology. The ratings for each set were independently 
summed, and the higher score was used for children with the com- 
bined subtype. The range of scores for children with each ADHD 

subtype was 0 to 18. The internal reliability (α coefficient) of the 
scales was 0.7 (inattentive) and 0.8 (hyperactive/impulsive). 
Impact on Parents. The Parental Impact-Emotional and Parental 
Impact-Time scales from the Child Health Questionnaire were 
used to assess parental perceptions of the impact of children’s prob- 
lems on the time that parents have for their personal needs and on 
their emotional functioning (Landgraf et al., 1996). As recom- 
mended in the Child Health Questionnaire manual, before the 
analysis of results, the raw scores on each scale were initially trans- 
formed to a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better 
functioning. The internal reliability (α coefficient) of both scales 
was 0.7. 
Parents’ Perceptions of Children’s Problems. All parents were asked 
whether they considered their child to have had emotional or be- 
havioral problems during the past 6 months. Those who responded 
“yes” were then asked “During that time, did he or she tend to have 
more emotional and behavioral problems than other boys or girls of 
his or her age?” and “Do you think he or she needs or needed 
professional help with these problems?” (all the questions were 
answered as yes or no). The responses to the latter two questions 
were dummy coded (0/1) and used for statistical analyses in the 
current study. 
Service Use. The survey asked parents about a wide range of 
services used by children and adolescents to obtain help for emo- 
tional and behavioral problems during the 6 months before the 
survey. Service use was divided into two categories: (1) use of health 
services (including family doctors, pediatricians, psychiatrists, psy- 
chologists, and community- or hospital-based mental health clinics) 
and (2) use of school services (including counseling services and 
special school classes). Parents were also asked to identify whether 
their child had received medication for emotional or behavioral 
problems within the previous 6 months. 

We first examined the rates of service use by children and the 
types of help that the children received. In each table, rates and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) are shown. In addition, the signifi- 
cance levels of specific comparisons of interest are cited in the text. 
The rates reported are unweighted because previous analyses have 
shown that there are minimal differences between results obtained 
using weighted and unweighted analyses with data collected in this 
survey. In the presentation of results, the term significantly refers to 
p ≤ .05. 
Univariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the 
variables that were significantly associated (p ≤ .05) with the use of 
health services or school services by children with ADHD symp- 
toms. In each analysis, the dependent variable was attendance at 
one or more of these services, whereas the independent variables 
were children’s demographic characteristics, parental perceptions of 
children’s problems, the impact of problems on parents, the type of 
ADHD (combined versus inattentive/hyperactive), the level of chil- 
dren’s impairment, and the presence of a comorbid disorder. Vari- 
ables that had a significant univariate relationship with service use 
were entered as independent variables in the multivariate model. 


The characteristics of children with each ADHD 
subtype are shown in Table 1. Overall, 70.1% were

b Parental employment: In this study, a parent was considered employed if he or she was in any type of paid employment 

males, 64.6% were aged 6 to 11 years, and 25.4% lived 
in single-parent families. Compared with other chil- 
dren in the survey, children with ADHD symptom- 
atology were significantly younger (ADHD = 10.2 
years, non-ADHD = 11.6 years, t = 7.8, df = 1,3559, 
p < .001), more frequently male (ADHD = 70%, non- 
ADHD = 47%; χ2 = 73.9, df = 1,p < .001), and more 
often living in single-parent households (ADHD = 
25%, non-ADHD = 16%; χ2 = 21.1, df = 1,p < .001). 
Children with the hyperactive/impulsive subtype 
were more frequently in the younger age group (χ2 = 
8.4, df = 1,p = .004) than those with the inattentive 
subtype. Compared with children with the other two 
ADHD subtypes, children with the combined subtype 
were significantly more often perceived by their parents 
as having emotional and behavioral problems (com- 
bined versus hyperactive/impulsive: χ2 = 10.0, df = 1, 
p = .002; combined versus inattentive: χ2 = 18.1, df = 
1, p < .001), to have comorbid depressive or conduct 
disorders (combined versus hyperactive/impulsive: χ2 = 
9.7, df = 1,p = .002; combined versus inattentive: χ2 = 
23.4, df = 1,p < .001), and their problems had a sig- 
nificantly greater time impact (combined versus 
hyperactive/impulsive: t = 3.0, p < .003; combined ver- 
sus inattentive: t = 3.5, p < .001) and emotional impact 
on parents (combined versus hyperactive/impulsive: t = 
3.3, p < .001; combined versus inattentive: t = 2.0, p < 
.05). The mean impairment score for children with the 
combined subtype (mean ± SD, 10.3 ± 3.8) was also 
significantly higher than the scores for children with 
either of the other subtypes, whereas the mean score for 
children with the inattentive subtype (mean ± SD, 
8.1 ± 3.9) was significantly higher than that for chil- 
dren with the hyperactive/impulsive subtype (mean ± 
SD, 5.4 ± 3.7). 

Among the 398 children with ADHD symptoms, 
112 (28.1%) had attended a health or school-based 
service during the 6 months before the study (Table 2). 
Although a higher proportion of children had attended 
health services (22.6%) than school services (17.1%), 
this difference was not statistically significant. Among 
those who had attended at least one of these services,

a Other health-based services included outpatient services, telephone counseling, and drug and alcohol services. 
b Other school-based services included help from psychologists, teacher assistants, and teachers. 
41.1% (95% CI = 32.0%–50.2%) had attended both 
health and school services, 39.3% (95% CI = 30.2%– 
48.3%) had attended only health services, and 19.6% 
(95% CI = 12.3%–27.0%) had attended only school 
services. This pattern of attendance varied little for 
children with different ADHD subtypes. 
The general health services attended most frequently 
were pediatricians (13.8%) and family doctors (12.3%) 
(Table 2). A similar number of children (12.6%) had 
attended mental health services (this service category 
included community- and hospital-based mental health 
services and psychiatrists and psychologists in private 
practice). 
Across the ADHD groups, significantly more chil- 
dren with the combined ADHD subtype than those 
with inattentive or hyperactive/impulsive subtypes had 
attended any services (combined versus hyperactive/im- 
pulsive: χ2 = 12.5, df = 1,p < .001; combined versus 
inattentive: χ2 = 13.0, df = 1,p < .001). This occurred 
because a larger proportion of children with combined 
subtype had attended both health services (combined 
versus hyperactive/impulsive: χ2 = 10.5, df = 1,p = 
.001; combined versus inattentive: χ2 = 11.1, df = 1, 
p = .001) and school-based services (combined versus 
hyperactive/impulsive: χ2 = 5.7, df = 1,p = .002; com- 
bined versus inattentive: χ2 = 5.4, df = 1,p = .02). 
Children with the hyperactive/impulsive subtype gen- 
erally attended services less often than those with the 
other subtypes. 
We also explored the hypothesis that the higher use 
of services among those with ADHD symptoms is not 
due to ADHD itself but to comorbid conditions that 
are commonly associated with ADHD. This is impor- 
tant because of the high rates of comorbidity among 
those with ADHD symptoms. These analyses showed 
that for each subtype, rates of service use by children 
with ADHD symptoms who did not have a comorbid 
condition remained significantly higher than those 
without ADHD symptoms (results not shown). 

In schools, counseling was the service most fre- 
quently received by children with any ADHD subtype 
(12.8%). Counseling was also the help most frequently 
provided by health services (Table 3). This included 
counseling for the children and counseling to help par- 
ents manage children’s problems or to improve family 
relationships. Eighteen percent of children with 
ADHD symptoms (95% CI = 14.5%–22.1%) were be- 
ing treated with medications (these included stimu- 
lants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics). 
Among those who had attended a health service dur- 
ing the past 6 months, 58.9% (95% CI = 48.7%– 
69.1%) were receiving medication. These included

25.6% (95% CI = 16.5%–34.6%) who were receiving 
medications only and 33.3% (95% CI = 23.6%– 
43.1%) who were receiving both medications and 
counseling. A further 31.1% (95% CI = 21.5%– 
40.7%) of those using health services received counsel- 
ing only. It should be noted that another 20 children 
(i.e., another 5%) were being treated with medications, 
but their parents did not report them as having at- 
tended a health service in the previous 6 months. It is 
likely that these children had been prescribed medica- 
tion before the time period during which service use 
was assessed. 
Additional Help Requested by Those Attending 
Health Services 
Among parents of children attending health services, 
68.8% (95% CI = 60.2%–77.3%) wanted more help 
(Table 4). Counseling was the help most frequently 
requested, with 53.6% of these parents requesting ad- 
ditional counseling for their children and 57.1% re- 
questing additional counseling for themselves. 
Interestingly, 17% of parents (95% CI = 10.0%– 
23.9%), primarily single mothers and parents already 
receiving government assistance, requested additional 
help with rent, finance, food, or clothing. Only 21.4%

wanted additional medication for their children. Of 
these, 75% (18 of 24) were parents of children who 
were already receiving medication as part of their treat- 
ment regimen. 
Factors Associated With the Use of School and 
Health Services 
In univariate analyses, parental perceptions that chil- 
dren had more problems than their peers and that they 
needed professional help, the impact of problems on 
the lives of parents, 
impaired functioning due to 
ADHD, symptoms of combined ADHD subtype, and 
the presence of a comorbid MDD or CD were all 
significantly associated with attendance at a school or 
health service (Table 5). In analyses adjusting for the 
presence of the other variables showing a significant 
univariate relationship with service use, parental per- 
ception of the need for professional help, the impact of 
problems on parental time, impaired functioning due 
to ADHD symptoms, and the presence of comorbid 
MDD or CD had a significant association with ser- 
vice use. As anticipated, in the univariate analysis, 
the parent emotional impact score was inversely asso- 
ciated with service use (low score implies high impact), 
but after adjustment for other terms including time 
impact, the association was no longer inverse. This 
result is difficult to interpret given the high correlation 
(r = 0.65, p < .001) between time and emotional im- 
pacts. 
We also tested relevant interactions to determine 
whether the factors in the final model differed by age 
and gender. The only significant interactions are shown 
in Table 5. These show that, among children with 
ADHD, a higher proportion of girls with comorbid 
disorders than boys with comorbid disorders and a 
higher proportion of older children with the combined 
ADHD subtype than the younger children with the 
combined ADHD subtype attend services. The inclu- 
sion of these interaction terms and the associated main 
effects of age and gender produced a significant im- 
provement in the overall fit of the model (χ2 = 11.85, 
df = 4,p < .05). 
This set of analyses was repeated to identify signifi- 
cant correlates (from those shown in Table 5) of atten- 
dance at health services, school services, or mental 
health services. Univariate relationships between the 
correlates and service attendance varied little across the

a Adjusted for the other independent variables shown in the 

three service types. However, for health services, only 
parent perception that children had more problems 
than their peers (3.0; 95% CI = 1.2–7.5) and the im- 
pact of problems on parental time (0.98; 95% CI = 
0.97–1.00) had significant adjusted odds ratios; for 
mental health services, the presence of a comorbid dis- 
order (4.0; 95% CI = 1.7–9.6) and less maternal edu- 
cation (2.4; 95% CI = 1.1–5.5) had significant 
adjusted odds ratios; and for school services only pa- 
rental perception that children needed professional 
help (4.7; 95% CI = 1.5–14.7) had a significant ad- 
justed odds ratio. 




The most frequent reason given by parents of chil- 
dren with ADHD symptoms who had not attended 
services was that they felt they could manage their chil- 
dren’s problems on their own (20.3%). Other reasons 
were primarily practical such as the cost of services 
(14.7%), not knowing where to get help (14%), and 
the length of waiting lists (10.5%). Only 2.8% of par- 
ents reported that the attitude of friends or family 
members was a barrier to seeking help. 

Only a minority of children with ADHD symptoms 
had received help from professional services during the 
6 months before the survey. Family doctors and pedia- 
tricians played a key role in the provision of these 
services. Dulcan et al. (1990) have drawn attention to 
the role of pediatricians as gatekeepers to mental health 
services in the United States. In other countries such as 
the United Kingdom and Australia, family doctors pro- 
vide primary health care for children, with pediatricians 
having a more specialist role. In these countries, increasing 
recognition of the important role of family doctors in the 
provision of help for children and adults with mental 
health problems has led to several policy changes. These 
include attempts to improve the quality of treatment part- 
nerships between family doctors and psychiatrists, pro- 
viding financial incentives to encourage family doctors 
to obtain additional training in brief psychotherapeutic 
techniques, and the provision of financial support that 
can be used by family doctors to arrange additional 
help for children with mental health problems. 
School-based services were also an important source 
of professional help for children with ADHD symp- 
toms, although the rate of use of these services in this 
study (17.1%) was lower than that reported in the 
United States (25%) (Jensen et al., 1999). In this 
study, more than 80% of children attending school- 
based services were also attending health services. This 
pattern may reflect the high rates of comorbid aca- 
demic and learning problems experienced by children 
with ADHD symptoms. Health and education services 
are typically administered separately in most Western 
countries. However, this does not reflect the pattern of 
problems experienced by children where those with 
problems in one area often have problems in another. 
Among those who attended health services, 72.2% 
received counseling and 45.6% received stimulants. Be- 
cause they may not be measuring the same thing, cau- 
tion is necessary when comparing differences in the 
rates of counseling in this study (72.2%) and rates of 
psychotherapy (25.2%) in the study conducted by 
Hoagwood et al. (2000). However, it does appear that 
stimulants are prescribed less often for children with 
ADHD attending health services in Australia (45.6%) 
than in the United States (75.4%). Despite this, among 
those who had attended health services in Australia, 
63.4% of parents requested additional counseling for 
children and parents. A much smaller proportion 
(25.6%) requested additional medication for their chil- 
dren. Interestingly, the majority of these were parents 
whose children were already receiving medication. It 
suggests that the medication being received may not 
have been effective or the amount was inadequate. This 
is consistent with previous findings that children with 
ADHD treated in the community often receive a sub- 
optimal dose of stimulants (MTA, 1999). 
The frequency at which additional help was re- 
quested by parents highlights the importance of not 
assuming that the needs of children and their parents 
who attend services have been met. It also highlights 
the importance of considering public knowledge and 
attitudes when planning mental health services (Jorm, 
2000). There has been considerable emphasis on the 
importance of evidence-based practice. However, new 
treatment programs must not only be effective, they 
must also be acceptable to children and their parents 
who are the potential recipients of the programs. If they 
fail to do this, it is likely that parents will seek help 
from alternative service providers. At present, there is a 
strong focus on the development of new medications to 
help children with mental health problems. However, 
the results of this study highlight the importance that 
parents place on counseling for their children and 
themselves. 
Key predictors of service use were parental percep- 
tions that children had emotional and behavioral prob- 
lems and needed professional help, the perceived 
impact of children’s problems on parents, children’s 
functional impairment, and the presence of comorbid 
MDD or CD. The findings highlight the crucial role 
played by parental perceptions of children’s problems 
and their need for professional help. Dulcan et al. 
(1990) have shown that parents are crucial informants, 


alerting pediatricians to the presence of emotional and 
behavioral problems that would otherwise go undetec- 
ted. In this study, we highlight the close relationship 
between parental perceptions of children’s problems 
and attendance at services by children. It draws atten- 
tion to the potential influence of factors other than 
children’s symptomatology on their use of health and 
school services. 

Limitations of the study are the use of parent reports 
to describe children’s use of health and school services, 
the use of symptom criteria to identify children with 
ADHD, the absence of reports from teachers about 
children’s ADHD symptomatology, and the response 
rate of 70%. In regard to the latter, extensive compari- 
sons were made between the demographic characteris- 
tics of children and adolescents who participated in the 
study and those of the same age group reported in 
census data collected by the Australian Bureau of Sta- 
tistics. The characteristics of the study sample showed 
only minor deviations from the total population. These 
primarily consisted of a slight overrepresentation of 
younger children and underrepresentation of the oldest 
children. We cannot determine in this study whether 
the factors associated with service use were specific for 
ADHD or apply to mental disorders more generally. 
Finally, the data were collected 6 years ago and patterns 
of service and awareness of ADHD may have changed 
in the interim. 

Only a minority of children in the community with 
mental health problems receive professional help. 
Among these, the majority receive help from general 
health services and school-based services with only a 
small proportion of children receiving help from spe- 
cialist mental health services. There are two important 
implications for child and adolescent psychiatrists aris- 
ing from these findings. First, the findings emphasize 
the important role that child and adolescent psychia- 
trists can play in providing professional advice and sup- 
port to staff in general health and educational services. 
Second, the results highlight the major challenge facing 
health services in determining the level of resources that 
should be allocated to clinical versus population-level 

interventions for children and adolescents with mental 
health problems. It is important that child and adoles- 
cent psychiatrists are actively involved in this process of 
resource allocation to achieve the most effective use of 
the scarce resources available to help children and ado- 
lescents with mental disorders (Offord et al., 1987).
