Background: Depression is a common mental health problem in adolescents worldwide. The aim of the present 
study was to investigate the prevalence, comorbidity and sociodemographic and socioeconomic associations of 
depression and depressive symptoms, as well as the relevant health services use in a sample of adolescents in 
Greece. 
Methods: Five thousand six hundred fourteen adolescents aged 16–18 years old and attending 25 senior high 
schools were screened and a stratified random sample of 2,427 were selected for a detailed interview. Psychiatric 
morbidity was assessed with a fully structured psychiatric interview, the revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R). 
The use of substances, such as alcohol, nicotine and cannabis, and several sociodemographic and socioeconomic 
variables have been also assessed. 
Results: In our sample the prevalence rates were 5.67 % for the depressive episode according to ICD-10 and 17.43 % 
for a broader definition of depressive symptoms. 49.38 % of the adolescents with depressive episode had at least one 
comorbid anxiety disorder [OR: 7.76 (5.52-10.92)]. Only 17.08 % of the adolescents with depression have visited a 
doctor due to a psychological problem during the previous year. Anxiety disorders, substance use, female gender, 
older age, having one sibling, and divorce or separation of the parents were all associated with depression. In 
addition, the presence of financial difficulties in the family was significantly associated with an increased 
prevalence of both depression and depressive symptoms. 
Conclusions: Prevalence and comorbidity rates of depression among Greek adolescents are substantial. Only a 
small minority of depressed adolescents seek professional help. Significant associations with financial difficulties 
are reported. 
Background 
Depression is one of the leading causes of disease bur- 
den and disability across all age groups [1] and a major 
risk factor for suicide, substance abuse and serious 
social and educational impairments [2–4]. Although ad- 
olescents are often considered as a healthy population, 
they appear to be particularly vulnerable to depressive 
disorders [5]. Prevalence rates in childhood are low 
with no gender differences [6] and then increase signifi- 
cantly in adolescence, while gender differences emerge 
[7, 8]. Estimated 1-year prevalence rates of unipolar de- 
pression in mid to late adolescence range between 4–5 %

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article 
and are comparable to those observed in the adult popula- 
tion [9, 10], while the cumulative probability of depression 
by the end of adolescence appears to be as high as 20 % 
[11, 12]. During the last decades the prevalence of depres- 
sion in adolescence appears to have increased in the most 
recent birth cohorts [13]. Although it is not yet clear if this 
is due to a pure rise in the prevalence of the disorder or if 
it can be at least partially attributed to methodological 
problems, the World Health Organization reports a rise in 
the burden of depression globally and a World Health 
Assembly resolution in May 2012 called for a coordinated 
response to mental disorders at country level [14]. In 
Greece there has been limited research on the epidemi- 
ology of depressive disorders in adolescence. A recent 
study, which investigated depressive symptomatology in 
Greek adolescents attending senior high schools, reported

a prevalence rate of 26.2 % [15]. An earlier study has also 
shown high prevalence of depressive symptoms in adoles- 
cents aged 12–17 years old [16]. A recent study in Greek 
adults reported that one month prevalence rate of major 
depression in the subgroup of youth under 24 years old 
increased considerably between the years 2008 and 2011. 
In the same study, younger age was identified as a risk fac- 
tor for major depression in the Greek population [17]. 
However, it is worth noting that the above mentioned 
study was a telephone survey. Another study of Greek 
adults, which has implemented a different sampling 
procedure and has used a fully structured psychiatric 
interview, reported a lower prevalence rate of depres- 
sion, which increased with age [18]. 
Depression in adolescence shows substantial comor- 
bidity with anxiety and substance abuse disorders and 
this finding has been well established through various 
studies [19]. Comorbid disorders are more common 
than the “pure” types, while comorbidity between anx- 
iety and depressive disorders in adolescents is greater 
than within the diagnostic group of anxiety disorders. 
Another common finding regarding adolescent depres- 
sion is the relatively low use of health services, despite 
the high prevalence and disability associated with the 
disorder. Health services utilization appears to be even 
lower in cases of non-comorbid depression [20]. 
Regarding the correlates of depression, beyond the 
well established sociodemographic factors of age and 
gender, socioeconomic factors are also important. A 
socioeconomic gradient in adolescent depression has 
been documented in both the United States and Europe. 
Similarly to findings reported by studies in adults [21], 
lower socioeconomic status has been correlated with a 
greater prevalence of depression in adolescents [22]. 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the 
prevalence, comorbidity and sociodemographic/ socioeco- 
nomic associations of depressive disorders and depressive 
symptoms, as well as some aspects of the health services 
use, in late adolescents in Greece. Greece has recently en- 
tered a long period of economic crisis with fundamental 
adverse effects on many areas of the life of the population. 
Our study took place during the years 2007 and 2008 just 
before the eruption of the 2009 financial crisis. We there- 
fore consider as important the investigation of some sig- 
nificant mental health aspects of Greek adolescents during 
the crucial period that preceded the onset of the current 
socioeconomic crisis. 
Methods 
Description of the data set 
The data reported here are derived from the “Epirus 
School Project” [23] which is a cross-sectional survey 
carried out in selected upper secondary schools in Greece. 
The study was approved by the Ethical committee of the 
Ministry of Education and the Greek Educational Institute 
and was conducted according to the Helsinki declaration. 
The study was also approved by the Head of each partici- 
pating School. All students in the selected schools were 
invited to participate in the study, while the participation 
was voluntary. Consent was actively obtained from both 
the students and their parents. 
Secondary education in Greece 
Secondary education in Greece is distinguished into 
lower secondary (grades 7–9; ages 13–15 years; attend- 
ance is compulsory) and upper secondary (grades 10–12; 
ages 16–18 years; attendance is not compulsory). Upper 
secondary schools are further distinguished into senior 
high schools (Lyceum) and technical vocational schools 
with the majority of students (75 %) attending senior 
high schools. In the “Epirus School Project” only senior 
high schools were selected (age of pupils 16–18 years). 
At the time of the design of the study approximately 
75,000 students attended 1,193 senior high schools in 
Greece. 
Sampling of schools and pupils 
Schools were selected according to the following rules: 
a) all senior high schools of the major cities in the 
north-western part of Greece (regions of Epirus and 
Aetoloakarnania) due to the proximity of this area to the 
University of Ioannina, b) all senior high schools in one 
randomly selected district of the Athens Metropolitan 
Area (the district of Kallithea was selected), c) all senior 
high schools of the island of Paros in the Aegean Sea 
(the island was conveniently selected due to the close 
collaboration of the schools and mental health units of 
the island with the Panteion University). A total of 25 
schools took part in the study. The mean number of 
participants per school was 267 pupils ranging from 100 
to 502. The main fieldwork took place between January 
2007 and April 2008. 
Design of the study and data collection procedure 
The study used a two-phase design [24]. In the first 
phase, all consenting students (N = 5,614, response rate 
82 %) were administered a brief screening instrument in 
the classroom. The screening instrument of the first 
phase was developed from the revised clinical interview 
schedule (CIS-R) used in the second phase of the study. 
Students were selected for the second phase psychiatric 
interview using a stratified random sampling procedure 
according to the scores on the screening questionnaire: 
100 % of those scoring high on the screening instrument 
(>75th percentile), 30 % of those scoring in the middle 
and 10 % of those scoring low (<25th percentile). The 
second phase (N = 2,431, response rate 95 %) consisted of 
the computerized version of a fully-structured psychiatric 


interview (see next section) and was carried out in the 
computer laboratories of the schools. It is noted that in 
two schools (both in the island of Paros) all consenting 
students were interviewed (that is the two phases were 
merged into one). The reason was the availability of the 
fieldworkers of the island of Paros, which allowed us to 
provide the instrument of the CIS-R interview in full to all 
consenting students. From the remaining 1,960 pupils 
who were selected according to the stratified random sam- 
pling procedure, 926 (47.2 %) were on the 100 % stratum, 
866 (44.2 %) on the 30 % stratum and 168 (8.6 %) on the 
10 % stratum. Four out of the 2,431 selected pupils had 
missing values on the sociodemographic questions (ad- 
ministered in the first phase of the study) and therefore 
2,427 pupils were used in the final analysis. 
Assessment of psychiatric morbidity: the revised clinical 
interview schedule (CIS-R) 
Depressive and other psychiatric symptoms were assessed 
with the revised clinical interview schedule (CIS-R), a fully 
structured psychiatric interview designed to be used by 
trained lay interviewers [25]. The CIS-R was the main 
instrument used in the national psychiatric morbidity 
surveys in the UK [26] and has been used in several other 
similar surveys around the world. A computerized version 
has also been developed and found to be comparable with 
the regular interview [27]. The CIS-R was originally de- 
signed to assess symptoms in participants above 16 years 
old but has been previously used in teenagers above 
14 years old in Australia [28]. The CIS-R assesses the 
presence and severity of 14 common psychiatric symp- 
toms (psychosomatic symptoms, fatigue, concentration/ 
memory problems, sleep problems, irritability, depressive 
mood, depressive ideas, general worry, worry about phys- 
ical health, free-floating anxiety, phobias, panic anxiety, 
compulsions and obsessions). Two screening questions in 
each section ask about the presence of the symptom dur- 
ing the past month and then there is a more detailed as- 
sessment of the presence, frequency, duration and severity 
of the symptom during the past seven days. Based on the 
above-mentioned characteristics of the symptoms each 
one of the 14 symptoms is rated with an individual score 
on a scale ranging from 0 to 4 (except depressive ideas 
scored from 0 to 5). In the first phase of the study we 
used the screening questions of the several symptom 
sections of the CIS-R. The full interview was taken by 
those students selected for the second phase of the 
study. Additional questions enable the application of 
the International Classification of Diseases – 10th edi- 
tion (ICD-10) research diagnostic criteria for common 
mental disorders (including depressive episode, phobic 
disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder 
and obsessive-compulsive disorder) using specially de- 
veloped computerized algorithms. 
The Greek version of the CIS-R was translated and 
back-translated using the procedure recommended by 
the World Health Organization http://www.who.int/sub- 
stance_abuse/research_tools/translation/en/index.html. 
The psychometric properties of the Greek version of 
the CIS-R including its factor structure and internal 
consistency have been reported by Skapinakis et al. 2011 
[29]. A test-retest reliability of the CIS-R was carried out 
in a subset of the present data set (two schools of the city 
of Ioannina with an interval between assessments of 
2 weeks) and was found to be 0.84 [23]. 
Assessment of depressive episode and depressive 
symptoms 
As mentioned above, there are two depression-related 
sections in the CIS-R: in the first section (“depressive 
mood) respondents are asked about feeling sad, miser- 
able or depressed, or being unable to enjoy or take an 
interest in things. More detailed questions ask about the 
frequency and intensity of these symptoms. In the sec- 
ond section (“depressive ideas”), respondents are asked 
about feelings of guilt, inadequacy and hopelessness and 
whether they thought that life was not worth living. 
Additional questions throughout the remaining CIS-R 
sections enable the application of ICD-10 diagnostic 
criteria for depressive episode. For the purposes of the 
present paper we defined a single variable for depressive 
episode, which includes all severities of depressive epi- 
sodes according to ICD-10 (mild, moderate, severe). The 
reason was that we expected very low prevalence rates 
of the more severe types of the disorder, since our sam- 
ple were active pupils able to attend school. Apart from 
this formal definition of depression, in our analyses we 
have also used a broader definition of “depressive symp- 
toms” irrespectively of meeting the ICD-10 diagnostic 
criteria for a depressive episode. This was defined as 
having a score of two or more (denoting presence of 
clinically significant symptoms) in both the “depressive 
mood” and “depressive ideas” sections of the CIS-R. 
Socioeconomic and sociodemographic variables 
Information about several sociodemographic and socio- 
economic variables was obtained from the students in 
the first phase of the study. The variables included: 
gender, own age, parent’s age, parent’s marital status, 
number of brothers and sisters, mother’s educational 
status, father’s educational status, mother’s employment 
status, and father’s employment status. The variable of 
the employment status of the mother included the add- 
itional category “looks after the house”, which was not 
included in the employment status of the father, since a 
in 
considerable proportion of women, but not men, 
Greece choose to stay out of the labour market, 
in 
order to look after the house. Students were also asked 


to subjectively rate their academic performance in school 
on a 4-point scale (excellent, very good, good, fair). In 
Greece, where typical 16–18 years-old adolescents have 
not yet entered the labour market, neither have they com- 
pleted their education, own educational level or occupa- 
tion cannot be used as a measure of personal social 
position. Academic performance in school has been often 
used in the literature as a measure of the social position of 
the pupils in school [30–32]. Further, adolescents were 
asked to rate their relationship with mother and father 
(excellent, very good, good, fair, bad). In addition we asked 
students to subjectively assess their family’s financial con- 
dition by asking them whether their family was having any 
financial difficulties. The specific question asked was: 
“How do you think that your family is doing financially?” 
The possible answers included: “My family experiences no 
financial difficulties”, “My family experiences very few fi- 
nancial difficulties”, “My family experiences some financial 
difficulties” and “My family experiences a lot of financial 
difficulties”. 
Other variables 
We obtained information about the use of health services 
in the second phase of the study. The specific question 
asked was: “How many times did you consult a doctor 
(family doctor, pediatrician, hospital doctor or any other 
doctor) for any reason during the last 12 months?” The 
possible answers were: “None”, “1-2 times”, “3-4 times”, 
“5-6 times”, “7-10 times” and “More than 10 times”. A 
second similar question followed, asking about doctor 
consultations specifically for a psychological reason. Add- 
itionally, we have investigated the use of substances, such 
as alcohol, nicotine and cannabis. For the purposes of the 
present paper we have defined frequent alcohol use as the 
consumption of hard liquor at least once weekly, smoking 
as smoking cigarettes daily and cannabis use as having 
tried cannabis at least once in their life. 


Statistical analyses 
The analyses were all conducted using the statistical 
software package STATA 12.0. To take into account the 
potential effect of clustering of our data (since adoles- 
cents were nested into 25 schools) we first carried out a 
two-level 
level 2: 
schools) in Stata using the gllamm command [33]. We 
also performed the models with the survey commands 
of Stata using school as the stratum. Results were very 
similar with both models and therefore in the paper we 
present the results using the survey commands because 
their use is more widespread in the literature. It should 
be noted that the effect of schools was negligible with an 
intraclass correlation coefficient close to zero (<0.08). In 
all analyses we have used probability weights to take into 
account the stratified random sampling procedure. 
The associations between health measures and socio- 
demographic and socioeconomic variables were investi- 
gated using logistic regression models. We used two 
dependent variables: (i) meeting the criteria for a depres- 
sive episode according to ICD-10 and (ii) experiencing 
substantial depressive symptoms (depressive mood and 
depressive ideas concurrently), irrespectively of meeting 
the criteria of a depressive episode. For each dependent 
variable we have initially calculated odds ratios adjusted 
only for age and gender and then odds ratios adjusted 
additionally for all other variables. Comorbidity was 
investigated using odds ratios calculated from logistic 
regression models, where the comorbid condition was 
the dependent variable and depression (either yes or no) 
the independent variable. Using similar models we inves- 
tigated the use of health services. Frequent doctor visits 
was the dependent variable and was defined as having 
visited a doctor more than twice during the previous 
12 months for any reason or at least once for a psycho- 
logical reason. For the purposes of the latter analysis we 
have created a variable for depression with three values: 
“no depression”, “pure depression” (meeting the criteria 
for a depressive episode only) and “comorbid depres- 
sion” (meeting the criteria for a depressive episode and 
for at least one anxiety disorder). 
Results 
Description of the sample 
Overall 5,614 students took part in the first phase of 
the study (55 % girls, 41 % 10th grade, 31 % 11th grade, 
28 % 12th grade), while 2,431 students were interviewed 
in the second phase (59 % girls, 39 % 10th grade, 32 % 
11th grade, 29 % 12th grade). A detailed table of the socio- 
demographic characteristics of the whole sample in both 
phases of the study is given in Additional file 1: Table S1. 
Due to the stratified sampling procedure there were more 
female than male students in the second phase. 
Prevalence of depression 
The prevalence of “depressive episode” according to the 
ICD-10 and “depressive symptoms” by gender are 
shown in Table 1. For all variables investigated preva- 
lence was significantly higher among the girls in our 
sample (p < 0.001). Having concurrent depressive symp- 
toms only (17.4 %, 95 % CI: 15.81-19.17) was three 
times more common than suffering a depressive epi- 
sode according to the criteria of ICD-10 (5.7 %, 95 % 
CI: 4.90-6.56). 
Figure 1 presents the reason reported by respondents 
about their depressed mood (“What sorts of things 
made you feel sad, miserable or depressed or unable to 
enjoy or take an interest in things in the past week?). 
The most common reasons were “my psychological 
condition” (24 %) and “problems with relationships

with friends” (21.2 %), while the least common was “my 
physical health” (2.2 %). 
Co-morbidity 
Table 2 presents the co-morbidity rates of depressive 
episode with main anxiety disorders and alcohol, smok- 
ing and cannabis use. 49.4 % of the adolescents with 
depressive episode had at least one comorbid anxiety 
disorder, while the respective frequency for adolescents 
without depression was 9.4 % [OR: 7.76 (5.52-10.92)]. 
All anxiety disorders were significantly more common 
among depressive adolescents. The strongest associ- 
ation was reported for generalized anxiety [OR: 7.92 
(5.35-11.74)]. 24.5 % of the adolescents with depression 
reported consuming hard liquor at least once weekly 
[OR: 1.85 (1.27-2.70)], 22 % responded smoking ciga- 
rettes daily [OR: 2.05 (1.39-3.04)], while 10.3 % re- 
ported having used cannabis at least once [OR: 3.48 
(2.05-5.93)]. 
Use of health services 
The use of health services is shown in Table 3. 10.4 % 
of the adolescents with “pure” depression (non-comor- 
bid) and 23.9 % of those with comorbid depression had 
visited a doctor for a mental health reason at least 
once during the previous year. On the whole 17.1 % of 
the adolescents with a current depressive episode had 
seen a doctor for a psychological problem or symptom 
during the previous year. Statistically significant differ- 
ences in frequent doctor visits were observed for ado- 
lescents who received at least two diagnoses and only 
for consultations due to psychological reasons [OR: 
2.54 (1.55-4.19)]. 
Sociodemographic and socioeconomic correlations

gender was statistically significantly associated with a 
higher risk for both dependent variables investigated in 
our analyses. The association was stronger for depressive 
episode [OR: 3.93 (2.65-5.82)]. Older age as expressed by 
the school grade of the pupils [OR: 1.69 (1.16-2.47)] and 
having one sibling [OR: 2.20 (1.17-4.13)] were both signifi- 
cantly associated with a greater risk for depressive episode 
according to ICD-10. Parent’s divorce or separation [OR: 
2.02 (1.34-3.03)] was associated with an increased preva- 
lence of depressive symptoms. 
Regarding parent’s employment status, the retirement of 
the father was significantly associated with a lower risk for 
depressive episode [OR: 0.39 (0.16-0.99)]. Some or a lot 
financial difficulties in the family showed a statistically 
significant association with both dependent variables. 
School performance was not associated at a statistically 
significant level with our dependent variables. We have, 
however, performed separate analyses for the boys and 
girls in our sample and we found that lower academic per- 
formance increases the risk of depressive episode only for 
the boys of the sample [OR: 2.72 (1.28-5.78)]. 
Discussion 
Main findings 
5.7 % of the adolescents in our sample met the criteria 
of a depressive episode according to ICD-10. One in two 
adolescents with depression reported at least one comor- 
bid anxiety disorder. Frequent doctor consultations due 
to psychological reasons were positively associated with 
depression. Less than one in five depressed adolescents 
had visited a doctor during the previous 12 months due 
to a mental health reason. A number of sociodemo- 
graphic and socioeconomic factors were associated with 
adolescents’ depression. Among them, the presence of 
financial difficulties in the family, as perceived by the 
adolescent, was significantly associated with both de- 
pressive outcomes investigated in the present paper. 
Comparison with other studies 
The prevalence rate of depression found in our study is 
similar to ones reported by other studies conducted in 
Europe and the Unites States. Costello et al. performed a 
large meta-analysis of approximately 60,000 children 
born over the past 30 years, from studies that had used 
a structured psychiatric interview to assess depression. 
For the subgroup of adolescents aged 13–18 years old 
they reported an overall prevalence estimate of 5.6 % 
[10]. Past studies in adolescent populations in Greece 
have not used structured psychiatric interviews and have 
mainly assessed depressive symptoms. Previous studies 
have chosen measures, such as the CES-D scale (center

for epidemiological studies of depression scale) [15, 16] 
or the Delusions Symptoms States Inventory/states of 
Anxiety and Depression [34]. The most recent among 
the studies in Greek adolescents showed a prevalence 
rate of depressive symptomatology equal to 26.2 % [15], 
a figure which is somewhat higher than our estimate of 
17.4 %. Studies conducted during the ‘90s on similar 
samples, found rates of depressive symptoms of as high 
as 33.4 % for males and 60.6 % for females [34] or even 
higher [16]. The observed differences could be explained 
through the different sampling frame and instruments 
used. Structured interviews, such as the CIS-R, may be 
more conservative in their estimate of symptoms com- 
pared to simpler scales [35]. 


Gender differences in the prevalence of depression 
among adolescents have been well established with ap- 
proximately twice as many females than males reporting 
depressive disorders in mid-adolescence [7]. It is not yet 
clear whether the observed differences are real or emerge 
due to methodological 
issues [36]. Misclassification of 
questionnaires has been reported and it has been dis- 
cussed that some items (like crying and lost interest in 
sex) are related in certain ways to female gender and, 
therefore, give gender-biased results in measuring depres- 
siveness [37]. In the present study the assessment of 
depressiveness is based on a fully structured psychiatric 
interview and not only on a questionnaire. As a result, it is 
expected that the variation found may be less attributable 
to methodological artefacts. 
Almost half of the adolescents with depression in the 
present study were presented with at least one comor- 
bid anxiety disorder. The finding is consistent with 
figures reported by studies conducted in different popu- 
lations. Comorbidity rates of as high as 75 % have been 
shown in some clinical samples [38, 39], with rates be- 
tween 20 and 50 % more likely to be reported [40, 41]. 
An interesting consideration regarding comorbidity 
rates between depression and anxiety is the one stated 
by some researchers, who point out that studies may 
underestimate rates, since major depression accompan- 
ied by subclinical anxiety would not qualify as comor- 
bidity [39]. The co-occurring anxiety, however, though 
subclinical at the moment, may have significant clinical 
implications later in development. 
Alcohol, cigarette smoking and cannabis use were sig- 
nificantly more common among adolescents with de- 
pression in our study. The strong relationship between 
alcohol use and major depressive disorder in adolescents 
has been noted by many previous studies [42–44]. The- 
ories about their etiological relation have proposed that 
depression increases the risk of alcohol dependence [45]. 
On the other hand, however, there is evidence that alco- 
hol use disorders may not only exacerbate, but may also 
induce depression [46]. 
Cannabis use and depression are presented com- 
monly as comorbid conditions in clinical and commu- 
nity populations [47, 48]. Nevertheless, the degree and 
the direction of their causal relation is a subject of contro- 
versy. Adolescents may use cannabis as a self-medication 
for their feelings of dysphoria, but cannabis use itself may 
significantly worsen, or even induce, such feelings [49, 50]. 
A number of cohort and well-designed cross-sectional 
studies have shown that it is the heavy and problematic 
cannabis use, rather than the infrequent one, which is as- 
sociated with depression [51]. Our study, however, did not 
aim at exploring the effect of the frequency of cannabis 
use on depression. 
Similarly, a number of epidemiological studies have 
investigated the association of cigarette smoking with 
adolescents’ mental health disorders [52, 53]. While 
externalizing disorders, such as conduct disorder or at- 
tention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been 
consistently related to adolescents’ cigarette smoking [54], 
findings about internalizing disorders, such as depression 
and anxiety, appear to be contradictory. Some studies 
report a significant relationship between these disorders 
and smoking [55, 56], while others have not confirmed 
any significant association [57, 58]. A recent study in 
Greek adolescents has shown that cigarette smoking was 
strongly associated with higher levels of emotional/ behav- 
ioural problems and the association was not moderated 
after controlling for the effects of possible covariates [59]. 
The present study presented evidence of socioeco- 
nomic inequalities in adolescent depression. On the 
whole, the association between socioeconomic position 
and depression across the lifespan remains a controversial 


area. Although lower socioeconomic status shows a robust 
association with high psychiatric morbidity, the results for 
depression are ambiguous [60]. In our study the socioeco- 
nomic risk factor was conceptualized through the financial 
difficulties of the family, as perceived and reported by the 
adolescent. Our finding is consistent with previous stud- 
ies, which showed that adolescents, who thought that their 
socioeconomic status was somewhat or much worse off 
than their peers had a higher prevalence of depression 
[22]. In our study both depression according to ICD-10 
and depressive symptoms correlated with financial diffi- 
culties of the family. Other studies, which investigated de- 
pressive symptomatology, have also reported associations 
with subjective measures of adolescent socioeconomic 
status [61]. A number of theories have tried to identify the 
pathways linking socioeconomic status and depression 
[62]. According to the stress theory lower socioeconomic 
status is associated on the one hand with higher levels of 
chronic stress due to financial difficulties, family problems 
and adverse living conditions, and with lower levels of 
personal resources, such as coping style, self-esteem, mas- 
tery and locus of control on the other. Many studies in 
depression are consistent with the above mentioned the- 
ory, while evidence supporting the strain theory, which 
underlines the decisive role of contextual and community 
features such as values, social welfare, social cohesion, 
infrastructure and policies, is conflicting [60]. Some re- 
searchers suggest that social determinants of health may 
be also explainable through the mechanism of status com- 
parisons [63]. In our study we have not asked the adoles- 
cents about their family income. It is expected that one 
part of the information obtained through the question 
about the financial difficulties of the families of the adoles- 
cents may be related to aspects relevant to social compari- 
sons. Likewise, the association in the boys of our sample 
of depression with lower academic performance, which 
could be seen as an indicator of the social position of the 
pupil in the school context, may also reflect a process of 
social comparisons among the adolescents. 
Finally, the present study reports an association be- 
tween depression and service utilization as expressed 
by frequent doctor consultations. The finding is con- 
sistent with previous studies suggesting that adoles- 
cents’ mental health problems increase help-seeking 
from all health-service providers [64]. In the Greek 
health system general practitioners do not act as a filter 
to specialized services and patients are not restricted to 
consult directly the health professional of their choice. 
As a result, medical doctors are usually the first profes- 
sionals the patients seek, when in need. Less than one 
in five adolescents experiencing depression consulted a 
doctor during the last year due to their condition, while 
only one in ten depressed adolescents with no comorbid 
anxiety have seen a doctor. The finding is consistent with 
previous studies from Europe and the United States 
reporting that only a minority of adolescents with depres- 
sion seeks professional help [20]. 
There are certain limitations of our study. The cross- 
sectional nature of our study should be taken into 
account when trying to interpret our results and draw 
causal inferences. Moreover, our sample included only 
pupils attending senior high schools (approximately 
75 % of the school-attending adolescents of this age) 
and not those attending other school types (for example 
technical vocational schools). Additionally, in the present 
study we have included adolescents from urban areas. Our 
sample is not a typically representative sample of the 
Greek population and many areas were conveniently 
selected, however it represents a significant part of the 
population of the country, since it includes important as- 
pects of the observed intranational geographical, econom- 
ical and cultural diversity (urban mainland, metropolitan 
and island population). Furthermore, parental employ- 
ment status was based on adolescents’ self-report, which 
may result in some misclassification. However, this kind of 
misclassification is expected to be random. Moreover, 
the question about parental employment status did not 
include information about the exact occupation and as 
a result an official “occupational status” classification 
was not possible. 

Additionally, we have used a subjective socioeconomic 
variable, namely adolescents’ self-reports on the financial 
difficulties of their families. It has been suggested that 
family’s 
directly questioning adolescents about 
income can be unreliable [31]. In the literature financial 
difficulties of the family have been often used as a socio- 
economic indicator in studies investigating socioeconomic 
health inequalities in populations of children and adults 
[23, 65]. These studies have shown that subjective indica- 
tors may be equally or even more important compared to 
more objective indicators of socio-economic status [65]. 
Further, regarding the service utilization, help-seeking 
can be only reported in retrospect, and symptoms of 
depression only at present. As a result, help-seeking 
may be reported for psychological problems in adoles- 
cents without current symptoms and vice versa. 
Conclusions 
During the last few years Greece is confronted with a 
serious economic crisis. Our study has tried to investi- 
gate some important aspects of adolescent depression 
in the country with data obtained just before the out- 
break of the crisis. The present study reports a significant 
burden of depression for Greek adolescents, even before 
the crisis and its effects became evident, and suggests that 
there is an important association between depressive 
symptomatology and financial problems. Only a small 
proportion of the adolescents experiencing depression 


have used professional help. It could be expected that a 
socioeconomic crisis would further worsen the above pic- 
ture. Further research, however, is needed to support this 
argument, with the goal to make the best possible use and 
distribution of available resources.
