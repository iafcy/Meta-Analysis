Abstract 
Purpose Adolescence is a critical age for the development 
of psychiatric disorders. Although Lebanon, a low-to- 
middle income country, has suffered from decades of war 
and political instability, the burden of psychiatric disorders 
among adolescents in Lebanon remains unclear. This study 
aims to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders 
among adolescents in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, and to 
study the correlates and treatment seeking behavior asso- 
ciated with these disorders. 
Methods Through a multistage cluster sampling design, 
510 adolescents, aged 11–17 years were recruited from a 
household sample in Beirut in 2012. Parents and adoles- 
cents completed a battery of self-reported questionnaires 
and interviews including the Development and Well-being 
Assessment (DAWBA), the Peer-Relations Questionnaire 
(PRQ), and a demographic/clinical information question- 
naire. Logistic regression models were used to study the 
correlates of psychiatric disorders. 
Results The 30-day prevalence of psychiatric disorders 
was 26.1 %, with anxiety disorders (13.1 %) and ADHD

(10.2 %) being the most prevalent disorders. Only 6 % of 
those with disorders reported seeking professional help. 
Parental marital status, not attending school, having a 
chronic medical condition, having a family history of 
psychiatric disorders, as well as propensity to bullying and 
to being victimized by peers emerged as correlates of 
having psychiatric disorders. 
Conclusions A clear treatment gap is evident with a high 
30-day prevalence of psychiatric disorders among adoles- 
cents in Beirut coupled with a very low percentage seeking 
treatment. Scaling up mental health services and addressing 
potential barriers to seeking care would be important to 
close this gap.

Epidemiology (cid:2) Arab world 

Mental health surveys [1–3] point toward an early age of 
onset of psychiatric disorders, with a substantial percentage 
of people developing at 
least one psychiatric disorder 
before late adolescence [3, 4]. Such data draw attention to 
adolescence as a critical period for the early detection of 
mental illness and early intervention. 
A recent meta-analysis of 41 studies from 27 different 
countries reported a pooled worldwide prevalence of 
13.4 % for mental disorders in children and adolescents 
[5]. Only two reports in that meta-analysis were from 
Arabic speaking Middle-Eastern countries. Indeed, 
the 
response to the growing burden of mental disorders in Arab 
countries has fallen short as evident by insufﬁcient mental 
health infrastructure and services [6, 7]. Implemented 
policies and services in the Eastern Mediterranean region 




speciﬁc to child and adolescent mental health are particu- 
larly suboptimal [7]. The paucity of large-scale systematic 
epidemiological regional data may have contributed to this 
shortage. The few studies that have been conducted, 
however, found a prevalence of psychiatric disorders in 
Arab youths that is comparable to worldwide data [8–11]. 
Although these studies relied on large representative 
samples and employed sound methodology, they were all 
limited to the Arab Gulf region which is characterized by a 
relative ﬁnancial and political stability as well as unique 
cultural values and lifestyle patterns distinct from other 
neighboring Arab countries, such as Lebanon. In addition, 
Lebanon has undergone decades of war and insecurity. In 
fact, Lebanon underwent a long demolishing civil war 
between 1975 and 1990 followed by multiple regional and 
internal armed conﬂicts as well as a long series of bomb- 
ings in its capital Beirut. This exposure to war and violence 
is known to lead to distress or even mental illness among 
some children and adolescents [12]. 
Despite strong evidence for a high burden of psychiatric 
disorders and a substantial treatment gap among adults in 
Lebanon [13, 14], prevalence estimates among the general 
population of children and adolescents are still lacking. 
Available population surveys in this age group in Lebanon 
have been limited so far to studying speciﬁc disorders 
[15, 16] and children in speciﬁc settings [17]. Reporting on 
data from the Global School-based Student Heath Survey 
(GSHS) collected in 2005, Mahfoud et al. found the 
prevalence of suicidal ideation to be at 16 % [16]. Through 
a nationwide study that relied on a teacher-completed rat- 
ing scale, the prevalence of attention deﬁcit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) was reported to be 3 %. The present 
study, 
the 
psychiatric status of youth (BEI-PSY), was conducted in an 
attempt to generate the ﬁrst general population-based sur- 
vey estimates on the prevalence, correlates, and treatment 
seeking behavior related to psychiatric disorders among 
adolescents in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. 




BEI-PSY recruited Arabic speaking adolescents, aged 
living in Beirut between 
11–17 years and 11 months, 
March 2012 and December 2012. Participants were 
recruited using a multistage cluster sampling technique 
whereby neighborhoods, streets, and then households (HH) 
were sampled from the different segment areas within 
Beirut. Neighborhoods were purposefully chosen by a 
contracted private research company in Beirut, based on 
their experience, to represent the different socioeconomic 

statuses within these areas. Since Lebanon lacks consistent 
street naming, an important landmark was identiﬁed within 
each neighborhood and streets in all four directions around 
the landmark were sampled. These landmarks included 
churches, mosques, schools, and other 
locations that 
deemed important within each neighborhood. If more than 
one landmark was identiﬁed within each neighborhood, 
only one was selected randomly. Household sampling was 
systematic and proportionate to the population within 
segment areas, according to the estimates provided by the 
Central Administration of Statistics (CAS) in 2004 [18]. 
Since estimates of households were not available for 
neighborhoods and streets, the number of households to be 
sampled was divided equally among neighborhoods, and 
then among streets, within each segment area. At the level 
of streets, and in the absence of a sampling frame for 
available households, household sampling continued until 
the target number of households from a given street was 
obtained. Data collectors surveyed an equal number of HH 
on each street, starting on opposing ends and sides of the 
street. Sampling of participants on each street ceased when 
the targeted number had been reached. When the data 
collector completed their end of the street before reaching 
their target number of HH knocks, they walked back in the 
opposite direction knocking on the ﬂoors the other surveyor 
had left out (i.e., knocking on odd ﬂoors in case previous 
surveyor knocked on even ﬂoors). We here assumed that 
any household on a street is representative of that street. 
Households with at least one adolescent who spoke Arabic 
were eligible to participate. Within eligible households, 
one adolescent along with his/her parent/legal guardian 
were selected. For households with more than one eligible 
adolescent, only one was randomly chosen. When the 
chosen adolescent was unavailable or the household could 
not be reached, the household was revisited only once. 
Data collection was done after school hours and on 
weekends. 
After extensive training, monitoring, and assessment by 
our research team, 22 data collectors were ultimately 
employed. A total of 9061 households were approached. Of 
those, 3517 households were identiﬁed as ineligible and 
4540 were of unknown eligibility [No one answered the 
door (59 %), only the helper was present (16 %), ﬁeld 
workers could not access the building (12 %), refusal 
before establishing eligibility (9 %), parents not available 
(3 %), or ﬁeld worker could not tell if the household was 
eligible for another reason (1 %)]. A total of 1004 house- 
holds were eligible for participation. Of those, 51.0 % 
completed the interviews leaving a total sample of 510, 363 
refused to participate, and the remaining were either break- 
offs or cases where the randomly selected child was 
unavailable in both visits. Across the different segment 
areas, response rates varied in range between 44 and 71 % 


in seven out of eight of the areas, within one area (Zkak El 
Blat) having an exceptionally low rate at 16 %.

the parents/legal 
The selected adolescent and one of 
guardians were separately interviewed using the Develop- 
ment and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) [19]. Clinical 
diagnoses were generated based on the DAWBA by a child 
and adolescent psychiatrist (FM) and a licensed masters- 
level psychologist 
the adolescents 
completed the Peer-Relations Questionnaire (PRQ) [20]. 


The DAWBA is a package of interviews and questionnaires 
used to generate psychiatric diagnoses in children and 
adolescents based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Man- 
ual—4th edition (DSM-IV) and the International Classiﬁ- 
cation of Disease-10 (ICD-10). Diagnostic predictions are 
generated by the DAWBA based on input from multiple 
informants. The information, including open-ended ques- 
tions, is then reviewed by a mental health professional to 
verify or overrule the generated diagnoses. 
For this study, an Arabic version of the DAWBA that 
had been validated for the use in Yemeni children aged 
5–12 years [21] was revised to improve cultural and lin- 
guistic applicability to the Lebanese sample, and was 
updated to expand clinical breadth to bipolar disorder, 
substance use, eating disorder, and psychosis. The revised 
Arabic version of the DAWBA was validated in a Leba- 
nese clinical sample of children and adolescents and 
showed excellent inter-rater reliabilities for disruptive and 
mood disorders (j = 0.93 and 0.82, respectively), and 
good inter-rater reliability for anxiety disorders (j = 0.72) 
between the raters who generated diagnoses for BEI-PSY 
[22]. 
The recruited adolescent and one parent were inter- 
viewed separately. Adolescents were also asked to com- 
plete the ‘‘Substance Use’’ section of the DAWBA alone, 
without being interviewed by the ﬁeld worker. A few cases 
(3 %) were judged to be challenging for rating by at least 
one rater and were accordingly discussed between the two 
raters until a consensus was reached. Diagnoses were 
grouped and analyzed as follows: ‘‘Emotional Disorders’’ 
included Mood Disorders and Anxiety Disorders with the 
latter 
and 
including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; 
‘‘Externalizing Disor- 
ders’’ included Attention Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity Disorder 
and Conduct Disorders (Conduct Disorder & Oppositional 
Deﬁant Disorder); ‘‘Others’’ included Tic Disorder, Per- 
Eating Disorder, 
vasive Developmental Disorder, 
This 12-item scale produces three sub-scores: bullying 
(PRQ-Bully), being victimized (PRQ-Victim), and proso- 
cial behavior (PRQ-Prosocial). Response options include a 
4-point Likert scale from 1 = Never to 4 = Very Often. It 
was translated to Arabic by the study team and back- 
translated by a psychologist and then the ﬁnal Arabic 
version was adjusted accordingly. The version used in this 
study showed good internal consistency in this sample 
‘‘PRQ-Bullies’’ 
[‘‘PRQ-Victim’’ 
(a = 0.70)]. 



Basic demographic information was collected from the 
parent and included information about the family structure, 
the parents’ educational level and income; the adolescent’s 
education; the adolescent’s general medical health; and 
family psychiatric history. 

As part of the data collection sheet provided, questions on 
treatment seeking behavior were collected from the par- 
ents. These questions included whether the adolescent ever 
expressed interest in seeking treatment, whether the parents 
ever considered that their child needed treatment, whether 
treatment was ever sought, whether the adolescent was 
receiving treatment at 
the time of interview, and who 
provided that treatment. 

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) at the American University of Beirut, and has been 
performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid 
down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later 
amendments. Written informed consents from participating 
parents/legal guardians and assents from adolescents were 
obtained. Prior to initiating the study, data collectors were 
trained by the study team on the interview approach and 
administration of the instruments. Participants were given a 
stationery kit at the end of their participation. 
Three pilots were conducted before initiating the study 
during which data collectors were supervised and evaluated 
before deciding on the ﬁnal pool of ﬁeld workers. Quality 
control was performed separately by the research company 
and the study team through random call-backs of 10 % of 



recruited households that assessed accuracy of the infor- 
mation collected. 
(ADHD), and 24 (4.7 %) had a disruptive behavior disor- 
der (Table 2). 

Analysis was conducted using the Statistical Package for 
the Social Sciences (SPSS) (version 22.0). Chi-square tests, 
Student’s t test, and Pearson’s correlations were used to 
explore correlations between the different demographic 
variables. Less than 1 % missing values were present for 
each of the variables included in the analyses, and thus, 
list-wise deletion was performed for all further analyses. 
Logistic regression models were run to examine demo- 
graphic correlates of any psychiatric disorder, as well as 
any emotional and any externalizing disorder, separately. 
This analysis was done on three levels. First, bivariate 
analyses were run followed by multivariable logistic 
regression analyses whereby associations were adjusted for 
age and gender. At the ﬁnal level, multivariable analyses 
were run including all variables correlated with the out- 
come at the bivariate level at p B 0.100 (entered in the 
second block) in addition to gender and age in years (en- 
tered in the ﬁrst block). For correlates with high association 
with one another, we only selected the more semantically 
meaningful variable to include in the ﬁnal multivariable 
logistic regression. The threshold for statistical signiﬁcance 
was set at a = 0.05 based on two-tailed tests. 



Table 1 summarizes the sociodemographic characteristics 
of the sample. The sample included slightly more males 
(56 %), with an average age of 13.94 (SD 2.14 years); 
about a third of the sample was found in each age group 
late 
[early 
(16–17 years) adolescence], with no observed gender dif- 
ferences across these age groups. The vast majority (90 %) 
was Lebanese and about half of the participants came from 
households in which the father’s highest level of education 
was a secondary school degree or more. 


Prevalence of psychiatric disorders and treatment 
seeking behavior in the sample 
About one in four adolescents (26.1 %) were diagnosed 
with at least one psychiatric disorder. Of those, 54.1 % had 
only one disorder, 30.8 % had two and 15.1 % had three or 
more diagnoses. Thirty-four participants 34 (6.7 %) had 
mood disorders, 67 (13.1 %) had anxiety disorders, 52 
(10.2 %) had attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder 

Only eight of the participants (6 %) who received any 
psychiatric diagnosis sought treatment for their symptoms 
at any point; the parents of 50 (37.6 %), however, con- 
sidered that their child might need to see a psychiatrist or a 
psychologist. Due to the small number of participants that 
sought treatment, no further analysis was possible on this 
group. 
Habitual substance use, deﬁned as daily or almost daily 
use in the 30-days before the interview, was endorsed by 
a minority of participants with 12 (2.4 %) 
reporting 
smoking cigarettes and 9 (1.8 %) 
reporting drinking 
alcohol. Occasionally smoking marijuana in the past 
30 days was reported by 4 (0.8 %) and none reported 
using any other drugs. Substance use, however, was not 
considered in the calculation of the prevalence of any 
psychiatric disorder. 


There was no association between having any psychiatric

cents with psychiatric disorders were three times more 
likely to be from families in which the biological parents 
were divorced, separated, or deceased as compared to 
married. In further multivariable logistic regression anal- 
yses, only parental marital status was included in the 
models as a proxy for having the mother and father at home 
because they were strongly associated in the sample.

higher college degree was associated with 35 % decreased 
odds of the adolescent having a psychiatric disorder. Other 
indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) including the 
presence of a nanny/house-aid at home and the attendance 
of a public versus private school were not associated with 
having a disorder. Having a psychiatric disorder was 
associated with not attending school while family income 
in the lower tertile was associated with a 50 % increase in 
the likelihood of having a psychiatric disorder at a 
p = 0.072. Not attending school was used as a proxy for 
SES indicators in multivariate analyses as it was highly 
correlated with paternal educational 
level and family 
income. 

Among the 483 participants who attended school, repeating 
a school grade and receiving private tutoring at home were 
each associated with having a psychiatric disorder. Since 
data on school factors was only available for participants 
who attended schools, these variables were not used in 
further analyses.

Higher scores on both the PRQ-Bullies and the PRQ-Vic-

having a psychiatric disorder. 

Higher likelihood of having a psychiatric disorder was 
associated with biological parents not being married at the 
time of interview (divorced, separated, or deceased), the 
adolescent not attending school, having a chronic medical 
condition, having a family history of psychiatric disorders 
and having higher scores on PRQ-Bullies and PRQ-Vic-

While a higher likelihood of having emotional disorders 
was associated with being female, biological parents not 
being married at 
interview, having a chronic medical 
condition and higher scores on PRQ-Victim (Table 4), 
higher likelihood of having externalizing disorders was 
associated with being male, not attending school, and 
higher scores on both PRQ-Bullies and PRQ-Victim 
(Table 5). 

BEI-PSY, the ﬁrst study to investigate the prevalence of 
psychiatric disorders among adolescents residing in Beirut, 
showed that about one in four adolescents suffer from at 
least one psychiatric disorder, most commonly anxiety 
disorders and ADHD. Parental marital status, paternal 
educational level, not attending school, repeating school 
grades, receiving private tutoring at home, psychiatric 
family history, having chronic medical conditions, as well 
as higher propensity to bullying and to being victimized by 
peers all emerged as correlates of having a psychiatric 
disorder. 
The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in our study is 
higher than what has been reported in the international 
literature [5, 23], in systematic reports from neighboring

Arab countries [8–11], and in many of the studies that have 
used the DAWBA as a diagnostic tool [24]. Our ﬁg- 
ure seems to be primarily driven by a higher occurrence of 
anxiety disorders and ADHD as compared to pooled 
worldwide estimates [5, 25]. Previous reports on ADHD in 
the Arab World [26] and in Lebanon described lower rates. 
For example, a national study in school aged children in 
Lebanon revealed a rate of 3.2 %, using a teacher rating 
scale [15]. Our study, however, collected data in a struc- 
tured way from both parents and adolescents and our 
sample was taken from an urban environment—a setting 
that has been associated with increased parental reporting 
of ADHD [27]. With one in ten adolescents in our sample 
diagnosed with ADHD, our study provides evidence to 
prioritize ADHD in future interventions including educa- 
tion and support for teachers and parents. 
Our prevalence of anxiety disorders at 13.1 % compares 
interestingly with neighboring Arab populations. While 
1.6 % in a United Arab Emirates (UAE) school sample [8] 
and 5.6 % in Oman [10], the prevalence of anxiety disor- 
ders among a pre-adolescent sample in the Gaza strip was 
(21.5 %) [28]. Despite methodological differences among 
the studies, exposure to war and violence may also be an 
important contributor to these variations. While Oman and 
UAE have not experienced political turmoil or insecurity in 
the past few decades, Gaza has experienced constant 
instability. In addition to armed conﬂicts in recent years, 
political turmoil, ﬁnancial instability, and concerns about 
security continue to be daily stressors in Beirut. The rela- 
tionship between psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety 
disorders, and exposure to war has been established among 
adults as well as children and adolescents in Lebanon 
[14, 17, 29]. Among Lebanese adolescents, however, 
exposure to war has been both direct, through experiencing 
frequent turmoil since 2005, and indirect, through parental 
and societal reaction to a long civil war between 1975 and 
the early 1990s, and thus, warrants particular attention to 
understand the mechanisms underlying the development of 
these disorders. 
Despite the relatively high disorder prevalence, only 6 % 
of those who were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder 
sought professional help with a higher percentage of parents 
having considered that their child might need help. Although 
a majority of children and adolescents with mental illness do 
not receive treatment [30], the rate in our sample is alarm- 
ingly lower than that reported elsewhere, especially in

Western countries. For example, in the National Comor- 
bidity Survey—Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), around 
45 % of adolescents with a psychiatric disorder received 
some form of mental health service [31]. Conversely, in 
Oman, treatment seeking rates were similar to our ﬁndings 
[32]. No formal reports on the pathways and patterns of 
referral of mental disorders are available in Lebanon to help 
us understand the areas that require particular attention. 
However, public awareness on mental health remained vir- 
tually inexistent until recent efforts by non-governmental 
and governmental organizations yielded some substantial 
media attention. Additionally, the mental health coverage 
system in Lebanon raises signiﬁcant concerns regarding its 
equity and effectiveness whereby reliance on out-of-pocket 
expenditure and the fragmented nature of coverage may 
make mental health care too expensive for some [33]. With 
only about 75 practicing psychiatrists (1.9:100,000), Leba- 
non would be exemplary for studying and implementing 
task-shifting strategies, such as those proposed by the World 
Health Organization, involving schools and primary care in 
mental health service planning. 
Our study also provides evidence regarding groups at 
higher odds of having psychiatric disorders. About 40 % of 
adolescents with a chronic medical illness were found to 
have at least one psychiatric disorder. Evidence supporting 
routine psychological screening for some chronic condi- 
tions, including diabetes [34], has been established. Inves- 
tigating the applicability and efﬁcacy of screening models in 
the Lebanese context, including the assessment of available 
validated screening tools and possible referral strategies 
considering the limited number of child psychiatrists, is an 
urgent next step in bridging the treatment gap in this popu- 
lation. In addition, one out of two adolescents whose bio- 
logical parents were divorced, separated, or deceased were 
also found to have a psychiatric disorder. While many studies 
have reported on this association, highlighting parental 
divorce at an early age [35], family conﬂict before and after 
separation [36], and the lack of parental involvement after 
divorce [37] as predictors of psychopathology, these ﬁndings 
were limited to Western societies; therefore, further studies 
are needed to clarify the nature of this association, and room 
for intervention, in the Lebanese context. With respect to 
socioeconomic status, two proxies—paternal educational 
level and not attending school—were found to be associated 
with having a psychiatric disorder. While a similar rela- 
tionship was not found among Lebanese adults [14], our 
ﬁndings yet again highlight that groups with less resources 
require the most attention.

(cid:2) Adjusting for age in years and gender 
(cid:3) Multivariable logistic regression model included age in years and gender entered in the ﬁrst block; parental marital status, attending school,

School factors have emerged as important predictors of 
disorders in our sample. Adolescents who repeated school 
grades and who required assistance in their schoolwork were 
found to have more psychiatric disorders than their peers. 
Additionally, experiencing more bullying, both as victims or 
perpetrators, was associated with higher likelihood of having 
any psychiatric disorder with the former predicting both 
emotional and externalizing disorders and the latter pre- 
dicting externalizing disorders only. School mental health 
screening, particularly models relying on systematic identi- 
ﬁcation of individuals at risk [38], have been found to be 
effective as referral strategies for these adolescents. 

Due to the lack of an available recent census and local 
statistics, we opted to purposefully select neighborhoods in 
the different socioeconomic levels 
a way to represent 
within Beirut. This may limit our ability to generalize our 
ﬁndings to the population of Arabic speaking adolescents 
living in Beirut. In addition, our response rate of 51 % falls 
in the lower range of other community-based studies. For 
example, while response rate in the National Comorbidity 
Survey of Adolescents was 75.6 % [39], the response rate 
in the second Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of 
Mental health and wellbeing was 55 % [40]. The low 
response rate may have introduced biases to our sample, 
the most concerning of which is the possibility of selective 
recruitment whereby families with adolescents who may be 
suffering from mental illness were more likely to partici- 
pate in the study which could have inﬂated our prevalence 
estimates. Another 
limitation is that we only visited 
households twice for recruitment. While revisiting the 
households several times may have improved the response 
rate especially in the group who did not answer the door 
and in cases where only the helper was present, 
the 
response rate would not have improved the outcomes in 



cases where data collectors could not access the building 
and where parents refused participation before we were 
able to establish eligibility. Solutions to these challenges 
need to take into account the local context. Notwithstand- 
ing these concerns, our sample seems to reﬂect general 
demographic and socioeconomic trends within Lebanon. 
For example, the ratio of boys to girls in our sample was 
1.27 which is only slightly higher than the ratio reported by 
the Center of Administration of Statistics (1.07–1.17) [41]. 
In addition, the parental educational level was in line with 
statistics regarding the maximal level of education among 
Lebanese adults [41] with about a third of our sample 
having less than secondary level of education and a third of 
the adolescent sample having one or both of their parents 
complete a college education while monthly income. 
Moreover, and with regards to income levels, the average 
monthly income per producer in Beirut in 2007 was 606 
USD [41]; our sample fairs average in terms of socioeco- 
nomic status given that the median HH (monthly) income 
was about 1000 USD or less, and only 12 % reported a HH 
income of more than 2000 USD. However, the inability to 
test the representativeness of the sample, together with the 
sample being limited to Beirut, remains a major limitation 
to the generalizability of our results to Lebanon. 
While the DAWBA as a diagnostic tool has been 
extensively used in prevalence estimation studies, it is not 
without some limitations. In the Turkish translation, the 
agreement between the clinical diagnoses versus the diag- 
noses generated using DAWBA was only in the accept- 
able range for behavioral disorders [42]. The Arabic 
translation also had an inter-rater agreement for anxiety 
disorders that was only in the acceptable range [22]. 
Additionally, the DAWBA has been deemed to give more 
conservative estimates in comparison to other widely used 
tools, such as the DISC and the CAPA, particularly when it 
comes to internalizing disorders [43]. We also believe that 
our interview settings may have affected the extent to 
which adolescents reported substance use. Although the 
adolescents were asked to complete the substance use 
section of the DAWBA alone, they were still in the same 
house, and in some cases in the same room, as their par- 
ents, which may have contributed to the underreporting of 
substance use. 

BEI-PSY ﬁndings are the ﬁrst to highlight that psychiatric 
disorders are highly prevalent in adolescents in Beirut. Our 
data on treatment gap provides further evidence for mental 
health advocacy, research and policies focusing on treat- 
ment seeking behavior and access to care, respectively. 

Acknowledgments This study was funded through the Medical
