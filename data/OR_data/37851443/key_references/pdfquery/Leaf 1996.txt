Policy makers, researchers, and clinicians have long 
been concerned about the large number of children 
with serious emotional disturbances who do not receive 
treatment for their disorders (Institute of Medicine, 
1989; Joint Commission on the Mental Health of

Children, 1969; Knitzer, 1982; National Advisory 
Mental Health Council, 1990; National Research 
Council, 1993; Office of Technology Assessment, 
1986; President's Commission on Mental Health, 
1978; Select Panel for the Promotion of Child Health, 
1981). Many children and adolescents have home or 
neighborhood environments that place them at high 
risk for a psychiatric disorder (e.g., Richters and Marti 
nez, 1993). Recent studies have found high (e.g., Bird 
et al., 1989; McGee et al., 1990; Offord et al., 1987; 
Shafferet al., 1996; Whitaker et al., 1990) and possibly 
increasing (Achenbach and Howell, 1993; Ryan et al., 
1992) rates of psychiatric disorders in children and 
adolescents. We know little, however, about the use 
of mental health services by children and adolescents 
with psychiatric disorders or how recent changes in 
the organization and financing of mental health services 
have affected the availabiliry or accessibility of these 
services. 




In recent years, much effort has been devoted to 
improving procedures for detecting and classifyingpsy 
chiatric disorders in community samples of children 
and adolescents (e.g., Costello et aI., 1993; Lahey er aI., 
1996; Shaffer et aI., 1996). In addition to increasing 
our capacity to identify and monitor psychopathology, 
the goal of the National Institute of Mental Health 
(NIMH)-funded Methods for the Epidemiology of 
Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA) Study 
was to develop and test procedures for describing the 
use of mental health services in different communities 
and to determine whether the use of these services was 
related to the need for services (Lahey et al., 1996). 
Even more than adults (Regier et aI., 1993), children 
and adolescents receive mental health and substance 
abuse servicesin a variety of settings and from numerous 
professionals. If more effective systems of services are 
to be developed, we need to know where children and 
adolescents receive mental health services and whether 
those in greatest need of these services are most likely 
to receive treatment. 
In describing the use of mental health and substance 
abuse services in the four communities studied, we 
first present the procedures developed by the MECA 
project for the measurement ofservice-related variables. 
We then describe the agreement between reports of 
services made by parents and their children. Finally, 
we describe patterns of service use at the four sites. 


As described by Lahey et al. (1996). parents and youths aged 
9 through 17 years were surveyed concerning demographic charac 
teristics of the child and his or her household, 
the existence of 
psychiatric symptoms, 
level of functioning, and risk factors for 
psychiatric disorders. Both youths and parents were asked to identify 
the mental health and substance abuse services used by the youths 
both in the previous year and ever in their lives. The parenr 
interview obtained more detailed information than the youth 
interview because the collaborators had concerns abour the ability 
of youths to provide accurare reports concerning the details of 
mental health-related service contacts. 
ParentsReports ofServices. The services componenr of the inter 
view administered to parents obtained information about the 
youths' contacts with health , school-based, social services, and other 
service providers because of emotional or behavior problems or 
because of drug or alcohol problems. In an interview that used 
items modeled on the questions used in the National Comorbidity 
Survey (Kessler et al. 1994), parenrs were provided a list of service 
settings (hospital emergency room, drug or alcohol outpatient 
clinic, psychiatric outpatient clinic, social service agency or depart 
ment, social program in jail or prison, drop-in center or program 
for people with emotional or behavior problems or alcohol or drug 
problems, mental health professional's private office, medical clinic, 
health maintenance organization. or family clinic) and asked to 
indicate whether the youth had ever been brought to any of these 
settings because ofan emotional, behavior. drug, or alcohol problem. 
The parent also was provided with a list ofpotential service providers 
(pediatrician , general practitioner, family physician, psychiatrist, 
psychologist, social worker, min ister, rabbi, priest, other religious 
leader, counselor, nurse, occupational 
therapist, another health 
professional, spiritualist , herbalist, natural therapist, or faith healer) 
and again asked to provide information about the youth's contacts 
related to an emotional, behavior, drug, or alcohol problem. 

For youths with any reported contact, information was collected 
as to how old the youth was the first time a service was used, the 
most recent use, whether insurance paid for any of the services, 
and the frequency of contacts for nonschool services. Information 
was collected about prescription medications used during the 12 
months prior to the interview. For a child who had ever stayed 
overnight 
treatment program because of 
emotional or behavior problems , or because of the use of alcohol 
or drugs, information was collected about 
the type of treatment 
facility, whether the treatment was for emotional or behavior 
problems or drugs or alcohol, the number of admissions during 
the previous year, and the number of nights spent in these facilities. 
Parents were asked to report on whether the youth had received 
extra help at school for emotional or behavior problems, alcohol 
use problems , or drug use problems and on the nature of the 
services received, the age of the youth when help was first received, 
and whether help had been provided within the year prior to the 
interview. The MECA project also obtained data, not discussed 
in this report, on barriers to care and attitudes toward services. 
In the analyses presented in this article, summaty measures were 
created to identify the use of mental health and substance abuse 
services in the year preceding the interview. Using the reports of 
specific services and providers used by the youth, outpatient service 
utilization was categorized into six types of services: (1) mental 
health specialty sector including contacts with a psychiatrist, psy 
chologist, social worker, or counselor in a private office or psychiatric 
outpatient facility, or unspecified location for each of these except 
for the social worker; (2) medical services from a non psychiatrist 
physician or a nurse; (3) school-based services; (4) clergy; (5) social 
services; and (6) other or classification unknown, including services 
therapists, or faith 
provided by spiritualists. herbalists, natural 
healers. Inpatient and residential serviceswere categorized separately 
and not discussed in this report, which focuses on outpatient or 
community-based services. 
Youtbs'<Reports ofServices. All youths were asked whether they 
had ever received extra help in school for emotional or behavior 
problems, alcohol use problems, or drug use problems; the nature 
of the services received; their age when help was first received; and 
whether help was provided within the year prior to the interview. 
These questions about school-based serviceswere the same questions 
asked of parents. Youths aged 12 and older also were asked whether 
they had ever seen a professional outside of school for an emotional 
or behavioral problem or for the use of drugs or alcohol. Youths 
were not asked detailed questions about the type of professional 
or site of service and youths aged 9 through 11 were not asked 
their contacts with professionals outside of school. Thus, 
about 
the youth data could not be categorized into the six types of 


services described in the previous section. For some analyses, a 
variable was created that combines reports from parents and youths. 
Diagnosis and Functioning. Both parents and youths were inter 
viewedwith the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children 
(DISC) Version 2.3, a highly structured diagnostic instrument 
developed for use by lay interviewers (Shaffer et al., 1996). In this 
study, we used a summary measure of psychiatric disorders that 
included all children meeting criteria for any of the disorders 
included in the DISC-2.3 with the exception of the screen for 
psychosis and children who only met criteria for a diagnosis of 
phobia. In determining the existence of a disorder, we used the 
diagnostic algorithms that included data from both the parent and 
child and that required reports of impairment based on questions 
that were included in the DISC (Shaffer et al, 1996). 
An important issue for clinicians and policy makers is whether 
psychiatric services are being used by the youths most in need of 
these services. Because the MECA researchers had only limited 
experience with the impairment questions that are internal to the 
DISC interview, we also present analyses that 
incorporated the 
results of a more widely used measure of functioning, the Children's 
Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) (Shaffer et al., 1983). The CGAS 
was completed by both the interviewer of the youth and the 
interviewer of the parent, and it provided a summary of the worst 
level of functioning of the youth during the 6 months prior to 
the interview. In analysespresented, the CGAS score is dichtomized 
into children scoring 61 and higher and those scoring 60 or less. 
A score of 60 indicated that 
the youth had problems in some 
situations that were noticeable to anyone, although the youth could 
seem fine in other situations. Lowerscoresindicated more significant 
impairment. Because reports from both the parent and youth were 
used in ascertaining the existence of a psychiatric disorder, the 
lower of the parent and youth CGAS scores are used in the 
analyses presented. 



Sites. Data were collected from four geographic areas: (1) DeKalb, 
Rockdale, and Henry Counties, Georgia; (2) three towns adjacent 
to New Haven, Connecticut; (3) Westchester Counry, New York; 
and (4) San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
Populations. Children aged 9 through 17 years living in the 
community were eligible for inclusion in the study. Almost all 
adult respondents were mothers. 
Samples. A random sample of community residenceswas selected 
at each of the four sites. Data were collected on 1,285 child-adult 
pairs, although three of the children studied provided limited data 
because they had developmental delays. 
Sample Demographics by Site. The demographic characteristics 
of the sites were reported by Lahey et al. (1996). The sites did 
not differ significantly in gender or age of the children studied, 
but they did vary in other characteristics of the sample. The New 
York sample had the greatest proportion of non-Hispanic whites, 
the Georgia sample had the highest proportion of Mtican-Ameri 
cans, and the Puerto Rico sample had the highest proportion of 
Hispanics. Sites also varied in terms of household income and 
education of adult respondents, with the New York sample having 
the highest incomes and the Puerto Rico sample the lowest.

Because the primary goals of the MECA study were 
methodological in nature, we begin with a comparison 
of reports of service use by parents and youths. It is 
important to point out that these data include visits 
for mental health-related problems as defined by the 
parent or youth. Detailed information about the treat 
ment provided during each contact is not available. 
Parents and youths frequently differed in their re 
ports about the use of mental health services (Tables 
1 and 2). Regarding school-based services, 14.2% of 
the combined four-site sample were identified by parent 
or youth as having had an in-school mental health or 
substance abuse-related contact during the year prior 
to the interview. Although agreement was greater than 
chance, youths aged 9 through 12 years showed low 
agreement with parents (K = .21), with youths aged 
13 through 17 having a moderate level of agreement 
(K = .45) and an overall youth-parent agreement of

lC = .34. As expected, agreement concerning not using 
services was much greater than agreement concerning 
use. For youths aged 9 through 12 years, when the 
parent said no school-based services had been received, 
92% of the youths agreed. However, when the parent 
said school-based services had been received, only 30% 
of youths agreed. For youths aged 13 through 17 years, 
when the parent indicated that no school-based services 
had been received, 94% ofyouths agreed. When parents 
said school-based services had been received, 56% of 
youths agreed. When we examined agreement only for 
youths meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder, we 
found only a moderate level of agreement (x = .38), 
with only 49% of the parent reports being confirmed 
by youths. 
Children aged 9 through 11 years were not asked 
about mental health and substance abuse services pro 
vided outside of the school, so assessmentsof agreement 
are limited to youths aged 12 through 17. As Table 
2 shows, parents or youths identified 12.9% of the 
youths aged 12 through 17 as having at 
least one 
mental health-related service contact outside of school 
during the year prior to the interview. The patterns 
of agreement concerning use were similar to those 
found for school-based services. For youths aged 9 
through 12 years, when the parent said no nonschool 
mental health services had been received, 96% of 
the youths agreed. However, when the parent said 
nonschool services had been received, only 31 % of 
youths agreed. For youths aged 13 through 17 years, 
when the parent indicated that no nonschool services 
had been received, 98% ofyouths agreed. When parents 
said nonschool services had been received, 46% of 
youths agreed. When only youths meeting criteria for 
a psychiatric disorder were included in the analyses, 
agreement between parents and youths was .60 (ic) 
compared with .29 (x) for youths not meeting criteria 
for a psychiatric disorder. 
The MECA project did not evaluate the test-retest 
reliability of the questions related to service use, but 
it was possible to examine agreement between parents 
and youths concerning reports of psychiatric disorders. 
As shown in Table 3, agreement between parents and 
youths concerning the existenceof a psychiatric disorder 
was relativelylow (lC = .16), with the results not varying 
much with the age of the child (ages 9 through 12 
lC = .08 versus ages 13 through 17 lC = .23). Only 
17% of the children aged 9 through 12 years meeting

diagnostic criteria for at 
were identified by both parent and youth as having a 
psychiatric disorder, and only 23% of the youths aged 
13 through 17 with one or more DISC disorders 
were identified by both parent and youth as having a 
psychiatric disorder. For children aged 9 through 12 
who were using some school-based mental health ser 
vices, only 16% were identified by both parent and 
youth. Of children aged 13 through 17 who had a 
reported use of a school-based service, 33% were iden 
tified by both parent and youth, and of children aged 
13 through 17 who reported using a non-school-based 
service, 41% were identified by both parent and youth . 
Little information is available from earlier studies 
about whether or how use of mental health services 
varies by community. Table 4 indicates that the four 
sites included in the MECA project differed in the 
reports of parents concerning the use of any mental 
health or substance abuse services, and the specific 
types of services used at each site, although the three 
mainland sites produced similar reports of overall ser 
vice use. Those in New York were most likely to have 
had some mental health-related services (18.1%), while 
youths in Puerto Rico had the lowest report of service 
use (7.4%). Sites differed significantly in use of mental 
health specialists and mental health contacts with gen 
eral medical providers. Youths at the Connecticut site 
were three times as likely as those at the New York 
site to have a mental health-related contact 
in the 
general medical sector and 3.6 times as likely as youths 
in Puerto Rico. 
As Table 4 indicates, school-based services and men 
tal health-related contacts with the clergy also showed

significant site variations in the likelihood of use. At 
all sites, mental health-related contacts were most 
frequently provided in schools or by mental health 
specialists. In three of the four communities, the excep 
tion being New Haven, mental health specialists were 
more than twice as likely as nonpsychiatric physicians 
to have had a mental health-related contact. 
Although we did not ask younger children to differ 
entiate among providers of mental health services, it 
is useful to examine the overall reports of mental 
health-related contacts based on the combined reports 
of the parents and youths. In Table 5, reports from 
parents and youths are combined to provide an overall 
estimate of the use of mental health services in the 
four MECA communities. Patterns of service use are 
very similar to those in Table 4, which are based 
only on the reports of the parents. In addition to 
investigating the overall use ofservices, Table 5 differen 
tiates between services provided in a school setting and 
those outside of school, and services provided to youths 
who met criteria for one of the psychiatric disorders 
assessed by the DISC and those who did not. 
As with the parent reports, we found significant 
differences in the likelihood of service use in the four 
MECA communities when we combined reports from 
the parents and the youths, with the overall rates of 
use being higher as a result of the inclusion of service 
contacts reported by youths but not by parents. Overall 
service use varies little in the three mainland sites, 
from 22.8% in New York to 23.8% in Atlanta. When 
we differentiated between the youths with a psychiatric 
disorder as measured by the DISC (excluding the 
psychosis screen and phobias) and those not meeting 
criteria for a disorder, we found that serviceuse differs in 
the four communities only for those with a psychiatric 
disorder. At the three mainland sites, between 38.4% 
and 43.5% of all the children meeting criteria for a 
psychiatric disorder in the previous 6 months also had

some mental health-related contact in the year prior 
to the interview. 
An important question for clinicians, policy makers, 
and advocates is whether children with more severe or 
disabling psychiatric disorders are more likely than 
other children to receive treatment. Combining the 
data from the four MECA sites, T able 6 indicates that 
youths with psychiatric disorders and poor function ing 
as measured by the CGAS were 6.8 times more likely 
to have seen a mental health specialist thari were youths 
without a psychiatric disorder and with a higher level 
of functioning. When we examined the combined 
reports from parents at all four sites concerning contacts 
with mental health specialists, we found that having 
a psychiatric disorder (X2 = 10.48, df = 1, P < .001) 
and having significant impairment in functioning, mea 
sured by a CGAS score of 60 or less (X2 = 17.80, df= 
1, P < .001), each had a significant effect on reported 
use of mental health specialists. 
As Table 6 indicates, when we categorized children 
by diagnostic status and level of functioning, we found 
significant differences in the rates of service use only 
for the children with a DISC diagnosis and a higher 
level of functioning (CGAS = 61 or more). The use 
of mental health specialists by youths with psychiatric 
disorders and significant dysfunction were similar in 
the four communities studied, although the four com 
munities differed in the percentage of children with a 
diagnosis who received mental health services and the 
percentage of children with a diagnosis and a CGAS 
score of 61 or greater. 

States and local communities are restructuring their 
systems for delivering services to children and adoles 
cents without the benefit of data concerning the preva 
lence of specific psychiatric disorders, 
the level of 
dysfunction accompanying these disorders, or knowl 
edge of the use of existing services. Many of the changes 
in the organization and financing of mental health 
services are being driven by concerns with the overall 
cost of health care. These broad efforts to reduce the 
cost of Medicaid programs or the cost to corporations 
of health benefits pay only limited attention to issues 
related to the provision of services to youths with 
serious emotional or behavioral problems. To ensure 
that 
the needs of children with serious emotional 
disturbances are met, it will be important to mon itor 
the changes in health care policy and the changes in 
the patterns and outcomes of mental health services 
that accompany these changes in policy. 
The MECA study demonstrates the feasibility of 
conducting community-based research to examine the 
use of services by youths meeting criteria for one 
or more psychiatric disorders and the potential for 
generating data that can be used for structuring and 
monitoring systems of mental health services for chil 
dren. Even with the relatively small samples obta ined 
at each MECA site, we have been able to detect 
differences in patterns of service use, with important 
implications for unde rstanding the detection and treat 
ment of mental disorders. Important findings of this

study included the importance of schools in the provi 
sion of mental health services and the finding that 
symptomatology and dysfunction have independent 
effects on the use of mental health services. 
We had expected to find that reports of mental 
health services were related to the existence of a mental 
disorder. The finding that 
impairment also had an 
independent effect on use of mental health services 
warrants further investigation. It may be that dysfunc 
tion in children and adolescents precipitates the seeking 
of help regardless of the perceived cause of these 
problems, and some of this help-seeking is related to 
emotional distress not related to one of the psychiatric 
disorders assessed by the DISC. Future studies will 
need to investigate whether only certain types ofimpair 
ment are related to use of mental health services and 
the extent 
to which the failure to provide mental 
health services to certain youths, e.g., older youths with 
conduct disorders, could be influencing these findings. 
The MECA project constitutes an important attempt 
to link assessments of psychopathology with reports 
of service use. Although the lack of agreement between 
reports of parents and yourhs concerning the use of 
mental health services is similar to that found with 
reports of psychiatric disorders, 
this is an area of 
investigation where additional methodological work is 
required. In this study, we did not ask younger children 
the same questions about 
the use of mental health 
services as we asked older children. This means that 
we did not receive reports of service use from these 
children, although we did receive reports of symptoms 
from them. Additional research and deliberation will 
be required to determine the best way to obtain infor 
mation concerning psychopathology in younger chil 
dren and their use of mental health services. 

the purposes of this study, service use was 
defined as a contact with a mental health professional 
or other service provider related to a mental health or 
behavioral problem or a problem with alcohol or drugs. 
Some of these contacts might not have involved treat 
ment or mental health services. Many of the providers 
and service settings included in the list of potential 
service sites perform activities in addition to the treat 
ment of mental disorders. For example, pediatricians 
might refer children rather than provide treatment, 
and many school-based contacts might reflect testing 
rather than treatment, or even punishment for "bad" 
behaviors. In developing estimates of met and unmet 

needs, future research should examine the reasons for 
specific contacts and monitor in greater detail 
the 
activities that take place during the "service contact." 
This study found that one quarter of the youths 
had some reported mental health service contact, with 
36.5% of those meeting criteria for a psychiatric disor 
der having a report of a mental health service. In no 
community did as many as a third of the youths 
with a psychiatric disorder and significant impairment 
receive services from a mental health specialist. Future 
researchwill need to pay greater attention to monitoring 
the standards of care provided in different communities 
and determining whether some patterns of practice are 
more highly related to positive outcomes for youths 
than others. Many of the youths with a psychiatric 
disorder who did not receive services experienced less 
impairment and/or may have recovered without the 
use of formal services. Additional attention must be 
paid to developing an overall estimate of the number 
of children who are in need of treatment during any 
specified period of time. At a minimum, 
it will be 
important to take severity into account when trying 
to determine the extent to which there is a need for 
specific types of mental health service and the overall 
magnitude of the problem for different communities. 
These data also suggest that greater attention needs 
to be paid to the many professionals, especially social 
workers, psychologists, and teachers, who play critical 
roles in the identification and treatment of children 
with serious emotional disturbances. Schools present 
an important opportunity for the early detection of 
psychiatric disorders and the mobilization of resources 
for the support of youths with serious emotional and 
behavioral problems. The frequency with which mental 
health-related contacts are reported in schools suggests 
that psychiatrists and mental health professionals need 
to pay greater attention to collaborations with school 
based professionals, the training needs of these staff, 
and the supervision of mental health services provided 
within schools. Are children reported as having mental 
health-related contacts actually receiving mental health 
services or are they simply receiving information about 
potential referrals? We need to examine the roles played 
by educational, social service, and juvenile justice agen 
cies in the detection and treatment of youths with 
serious emotional disturbances and the extent to which 
the policies and programs in these agencies facilitate 



the identification and treatment of children with psy 
chiatric disorders. 
A limitation of the MECA study was the differences 
in time frames used to assess symptoms and service 
use. Information about psychopathology focused on 
the 6 months prior to the interview. Seasonal variations 
related to school assessments necessitated a different 
time frame, a l-year interval, for reports of service use. 
This inconsistency in time frames in the current study 
may have resulted in some youths being classified as 
using services while not meeting diagnostic criteria, 
when both the disorder and service use could have co 
occurred during the period 7 to 12 months prior to 
the interview. Future research needs to pay greater 
attention to more closely relating the assessments of 
psychopathology and dysfunction with reports of ser 
VIce use. 
The procedures developed for the MECA surveys 
constitute an important strategy for collecting the type 
of data that will be necessary if future health and 
mental health care systems are going to meet 
the 
diverse needs of children and adolescents with serious 
emotional disturbances. Projects such as the MECA 
project and the ongoing NIMH cooperative agreement 
studying the use, need, outcomes, and cost of mental 
health services in child and adolescent populations 
(UNOCCAP) will be very important as mental health 
professionals, policy makers, and consumers attempt 
to monitor changes in the services provided to children 
that would accompany the health care reform plans 
currently under consideration. The identification of a 
large number of children whose mental health contacts 
occur in schools, social service agencies, and juvenile 
justice agencies suggests that many of the costs incurred 
in the provision of mental health services are not 
included in data obtained only from the formal mental 
health service system. Efforts monitoring the effects of 
future health care reforms also will need to monitor 
potential shifts in the settings where children with 
serious emotional problems are served to ensure that 
these children have access to appropriate services.
