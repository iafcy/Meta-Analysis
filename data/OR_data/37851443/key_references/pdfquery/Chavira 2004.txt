CHILD ANXIETY IN PRIMARY CARE: 
PREVALENT BUT UNTREATED 

We present prevalence and treatment utilization rates for child anxiety disorders 
in a university-affiliated primary care clinic. Families were recruited from a 
pediatric patient list and 714 families participated in an initial study wherein 
they completed child anxiety questionnaires. According to parent and child self- 
report questionnaires (n ¼ 714), 22% and 20% of children, respectively, were 
above a suggested clinical cutoff on a brief anxiety screen; 19% and 14% of 
children exceeded clinical cutoffs on a separate social anxiety questionnaire. All 
families were invited to participate in a second study that included the Anxiety 
Disorders Interview Schedule for Children-Parent Version and questions about 
treatment utilization; telephone interviews with 190 parents showed 1-year 
prevalence rates of DSM-IV child disorders to be 10.0% (se ¼ 2.2%) for specific 
phobia, 6.8% (se ¼ 1.8%) for social phobia, 3.2% (se ¼ 1.3%) for generalized 
anxiety disorder, 0.5% (se ¼ .7%) for selective mutism, 1.6% (se ¼ .9%) for 
major depressive disorder, 1.1% (se ¼ .7%) 
for dysthymia, and 12.6% 
(se ¼ 2.4%) 
for attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Among 
children with a current anxiety disorder, 31% had received counseling or 
medication treatment during their lifetime, compared to 40% of children with 
depression and 79% with ADHD. Adolescent age and being Caucasian were 
predictors of psychotherapy use; having an ADHD diagnosis was a predictor of 
both psychotherapy and medication use. The high prevalence of impairing 
anxiety disorders, in concert with the very low extent of treatment utilization, 
suggests a need for methods to identify and disseminate empirically validated 
treatments for these disorders in the primary care setting. Depression and

INTRODUCTION 
Previous prevalence studies conducted in primary 
care demonstrate that child DSM-III and DSM-III-R 
psychiatric disorders are common in this setting. Rates 
of any psychiatric disorder range from 9–22% [Cost- 
ello, 1989; Lavigne et al., 1996] and extend to 42% 
when children with subthreshold diagnoses are in- 
cluded [Costello and Shugart, 1992]. Although much of 
the child primary care literature has 
focused on 
detecting and treating behavioral problems such as 
ADHD, epidemiologic findings show that anxiety 
disorders are also remarkably common in this setting.

children 7–11 years old, ranged from 1.0–9.1% (simple 
phobia ¼ 9.2%; separation anxiety ¼ 4.1%; overanxious 
disorder ¼ 4.6%; 
social 
phobia ¼ 1.0%). According to parent report, the rate 
of any anxiety disorder was 6.6%; based on child’s 
report the rate rose to 10.5%. More recently, Briggs- 
Gowan et al. [2000] reported a rate of 6.1% for child 
anxiety disorders in a primary care sample of 5–9 year 
olds (simple phobia ¼ 2.8%; separation anxiety ¼ 3.6%; 
overanxious disorder ¼ 0.5%). In a case control study 
of children (6–18 years old) with and without ADHD 
in a primary care setting [Busch et al., 2002], lifetime 
rates of anxiety disorders in the control group were 4% 
for overanxious disorder, 8% for specific phobia, 3% 
for social anxiety, 6% for separation anxiety, 2% for 
obsessive compulsive disorder, 1% for agoraphobia, 
and 0% for panic disorder and posttraumatic stress 
disorder. Among children with ADHD, the rates of 
anxiety disorders were much higher. Other studies have 
found somewhat lower rates, particularly in preschoo- 
lers [Kramer and Garralda, 1998; Lavigne et al., 1996] 
where methodological and diagnostic issues are com- 
mon. Overall, however, the not inconsiderable pre- 
valence of anxiety in pediatric primary care remains 
evident. To the best of our knowledge, data presenting 
the prevalence of DSM-IV child anxiety disorders in a 
primary care setting are not yet available. 
Differences in prevalence rates across studies often 
arise because of methodological factors, such as varying 
diagnostic criteria or changing levels of interference 
used to delimit ‘‘clinical significance.’’ For example, in 
a community sample, rates of any anxiety disorder 
dropped from 21% to 7.7% when a measure of global 
impairment was applied and rates were reduced further 
when disorder-specific impairment was also required 
[Shaffer et al., 1996]. Based on independent estimates 
from parent and child, 6.8% and 23.4% of children 
from primary care settings had a subthreshold-level 
anxiety disorder when symptom, duration, and severity 
criteria were more lenient whereas 6.6% and 10.5% of 
children had a clinical level anxiety diagnosis when 
more conservative (i.e., strict) criteria were applied 
[Costello and Shugart, 1992]. Although the optimal 
threshold for clinical significance remains somewhat 
arbitrary, different 
thresholds may serve different 
for 
purposes. Low thresholds may be important 
identifying children who are at risk for psychopathol- 
ogy whereas higher thresholds may identify children 
who are in need of more immediate treatment. The 
current study presents prevalence rates using both high 
and low impairment thresholds. We use the term 
‘‘clinical-level’’ to describe disorders that meet all 
diagnostic criteria and are associated with a lot of 
impairment (i.e., a high impairment threshold). Alter- 
natively we use the term ‘‘subthreshold’’ to describe 
that meet diagnostic criteria but are 
symptoms 
associated only with impairment 
is mild to 
moderate and infrequent 
(i.e., a low impairment 
threshold). 

According to previous estimates, 70% of youth visit a 
pediatrician at least once per year [Gans et al., 1991] 
and approximately 25% of 
families present with 
psychiatric concerns [Costello et al., 1988]. Recent 
data suggest that detection rates of psychiatric pro- 
blems in primary care are increasing [Kelleher et al., 
2000], but despite increasing rates of detection, there 
remains a significant gap between the number of 
children who need mental health services and those 
who actually receive appropriate care. In two separate 
studies, only 40–50% of children with a diagnosable 
disorder received a referral to a mental health profes- 
sional, medication, or counseling [Costello, 1989; 
Costello et al., 1988; Lavigne et al., 1993]. Of those 
children who are identified and receive a mental health 
follow up with treatment 
referral, many do not 
[Rushton et al., 2002] 
(or do not have access to 
treatment) and instead rely on their primary care 
provider for management of such concerns. 
At present, disproportionately more children with 
externalizing disorders receive treatment when com- 
pared to children with internalizing disorders, particu- 
larly in public sectors [Garland et al., 2000]. Within the 
primary care setting, the most frequently recognized 
problems include family problems, behavioral issues 
(e.g., enuresis and temper tantrums), cognitive lan- 
learning disabilities, and attention 
guage problems, 
problems [Horwitz et al., 1992]. The primary care 
setting having greater access and potential for devel- 
opmental assessment seems ideally situated to detect 
and possibly address mental health problems, including 
anxiety disorders. 
The goal of the current study is to provide a glimpse 
into the prevalence of commonly occurring childhood 
anxiety disorders and comorbid conditions in the 
primary care pediatric setting using contemporary 
diagnostic criteria. We also demonstrate the sensitivity 
of prevalence rates to various impairment thresholds. 
We provide a brief overview of mental health utiliza- 
tion in this sample. 
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS 
Families were selected from a list of pediatric 
patients who had been seen by their physician in the 
past year. Approximately 1,430 families with children 
between the ages of 8–17 were selected randomly and 
anxiety questionnaires were mailed to these residences 
by the providing clinic; 297 packets were deemed 
ineligible (i.e., wrong addresses or outside our age 
criteria), resulting in an adjusted eligible sample of 
1,173 families. Of these 1,173 families, 714 parents and 
children (61%) completed the anxiety questionnaire 
packets. Data in this first study were gathered to attain 
prevalence rates of anxiety symptoms in a community 
sample based on self-report instruments. Parents and 
children were asked to complete the initial question- 
naires, for which they received a $10 book certificate, 
in the follow-up study 
and to indicate interest 


presented in the current article by checking a box on 
the demographic form and providing their name, 
phone number, and address. 
Of those 714 families who completed the initial 
questionnaires, 359 expressed interest in the follow-up 
study, which included a telephone interview with the 
parent and supplemental questionnaires addressing 
attitudes toward treatment and social 
functioning. 
Only those 359 families who expressed interest in the 
second study and provided consent to contact were 
mailed a consent form; 190 families completed the 
consent forms (i.e., parental consent and child or 
adolescent assent), questionnaires, and the telephone 
interview. An additional 23 families completed the 
consents and questionnaires only. Families received 
$25 for their participation in the follow-up study. 
Diagnostic and treatment utilization data derived 
from the semi-structured interviews are the focus 
of 
the current study. Both studies were approved 
by the Human Research Protection Program at our 
University. 


the parents completing the 
interview was 43.95 (sd ¼ 6.03) years (age range ¼ 24– 
75 years old). Most parent participants had a college 
education (74%) and were Caucasian-American (71%). 
The ethnic composition of the non-Caucasian parent 
sample included Latinos/Hispanic-Americans (7%), 
African-Americans 
(5%), Filipino/Asian-Americans 
(5%), and individuals who identified as multicultural 
(9%). Approximately 54% of the child participants 
were between the ages of 8–12 and 46% were between 
the ages of 13–17. An equivalent number of boys 
(49.8%) and girls (50.2%) participated in the study. 

The Social Anxiety Scales. The Social Anxiety 
Scale-Children Revised (SASC-R) [La Greca et al., 
1988] and Social Anxiety Scale-Adolescents (SAS-A) 
[La Greca and Lopez, 1998] were used to assess levels 
of social anxiety with regard to peer relations. A 5- 
point Likert scale is used and total scores range from 1– 
90 for the social anxiety items. Adequate psychometric 
properties have been established in both clinical and 
non-clinical samples [Ginsburg et al., 1998; La Greca 
and Stone, 1993]. Clinical cutof fs ranging from 50–54 
(depending on gender and age group) have been 
suggested to identify high socially anxious children 
and adolescents [La Greca and Lopez, 1998; La Greca 
and Stone, 1993]. The SASC-R and SAS-A both have 
fear of negative evaluation; 
three subscales (FNE, 
SAD-New, 
in new 
situations; and SAD-General, social avoidance and 
distress in general). Subscale scores are used frequently; 
however, total scores are appropriate when attempting 
to identify clinical levels of social anxiety [La Greca, 
1998]. Internal consistency estimates range 0.80–0.94 

for the FNE subscale; 0.66–0.87 for the SAD-New 
subscale, and 0.60–0.80 for the SAD-General subscale 
in community and clinic samples [Ginsburg et al., 
1998; La Greca et al., 1988; La Greca and Stone, 1993; 
La Greca and Shiloff, 1998]. Test–retest estimates for 
the scales ranged from 0.63–0.75 for FNE, 0.61–0.75 
for SAD-New, and 0.51–0.47 for SAD General, using 
2, 4, and 6 month intervals [La Greca et al., 1998; 
Vernberg et al., 1992]. Concurrent validity has been 
established with other popular measures of social 
anxiety [Morris and Masia, 1998] and in a clinic 
sample, adolescents with social anxiety disorder re- 
ported greater SAS-A scores than did adolescents with 
other anxiety disorders [Ginsberg et al., 1998]. Both 
the parent and child versions were mailed to families. 
Anxiety Scale. The Screen for Child Anxiety 
Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED-5 item) [Bir- 
maher et al., 1997, 1999] was completed by parents and 
children. The 5-item SCARED is derived from the 41- 
item SCARED, which has good psychometric proper- 
ties and assesses various types of childhood anxiety 
including generalized anxiety disorder, 
separation 
anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, 
and school phobia. A 3-point Likert scale is used and 
total scores range from 0–10. The original SCARED is 
reported to have moderate parent child agreement 
(r ¼ 0.20–0.47), internal consistency estimates ranging 
from 0.74–0.93, and test–retest estimates ranging from 
0.70–0.90 [Birmaher et al., 1997]. The SCARED was 
also able to discriminate between anxiety disorders and 
other disorders as well as within anxiety disorders 
[Birmaher et al., 1997, 1999]. The five-item scale was 
created by selecting the one item from each of the five 
factors with the highest loading in a discriminant 
function analysis. The 5-item SCARED is reported to 
have similar psychometric properties as the original 
scale; scores of 3 or greater differentiate children with 
anxiety disorders 
from children with no anxiety 
disorders [Birmaher et al., 1999]. Both the parent and 
child versions were mailed to families. 

Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Chil- 
dren. The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for 
Children-Parent Version (Silverman and Albano, 1996) 
is a semi-structured diagnostic interview designed to 
assess DSM-IV childhood anxiety disorders as well as 
depressive and behavioral disorders. The following 
modules were included in this study: school refusal, 
separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, 
specific phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive 
compulsive disorder (OCD), dysthymia, major depres- 
sion (current and past), selective mutism, and ADHD. 
Due to time constraints, we did not include posttrau- 
matic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, agor- 
aphobia, conduct disorder, or oppositional defiant 
disorder. Published k coefficients for the ADIS-C/P 
disorders are 0.88 for separation anxiety, 0.86 for social 


anxiety disorder, 0.65 for specific phobia, 0.72 for 
generalized anxiety disorder, and 1.00 for ADHD 
[Silverman et al., 2001]. 

The ADIS uses an 8-point scale to assess impair- 
ment; scores of 4 or greater reflect at least ‘‘some’’ 
impairment. Parents were asked to give a rating of 
interference and to describe whether the child experi- 
enced impairment at home, in school, in friendships, or 
in some other way. In the current study, individuals 
were given a clinician rating of 4 or 5 if the parent 
reported ‘‘some’’ 
in one domain of 
functioning. The presence of such impairment was 
particularly common in individuals with specific fears 
and circumscribed public speaking fears where impair- 
ment was often focal and infrequent. Interference 
ratings of 6 or greater were deemed as more consistent 
with clinical levels of interference and with a need for 
mental health treatment. More specifically interference 
ratings of 6 or 7 were associated with ‘‘a lot’’ of 
impairment and a rating of 8 was consistent with the 
maximum ‘‘very very much’’ term. Clinician ratings of 
interference incorporated parent 
clinician 
judgment, and were informed further by consensus 
meetings that were held on a biweekly basis. As 
mentioned previously, the presence of all diagnostic 
criteria and significant impairment (as defined by a 
severity rating of at least 6) was used to identify the 
presence of a clinical disorder. 

A section on treatment utilization was administered 
at the end of the interview. Parents were asked yes–no 
questions about treatment received for anxiety, depres- 
sion, and behavioral problems during the child’s 
lifetime. Positive responses to treatment received were 
followed by questions about duration and type of 
treatment. 

REPRESENTATIVENESS OF THE SAMPLE: 
RESPONDERS VERSUS NONRESPONDERS 
There were no significant dif ferences in child’s 
gender, age group, parental 
level of education, or 
child- or parent-reporting of anxiety severity between 
participants who completed the initial questionnaires 
only (n ¼ 524) and those who completed both the 
questionnaires and interview (n ¼ 190). More Cauca- 
sians than non-Caucasians completed both the inter- 
view and questionnaire studies [w2 (1, n ¼ 676) ¼ 3.04, 
P o .08] but this w2 was not statistically significant at P 
o .05. Importantly, anxiety scores and social anxiety 
scores were not significantly different between those 
who did and did not participate, suggesting that 
response biases based on anxiety levels were largely 
absent in this study (Table 1). 

Interviews were audiotaped and reliability data were 
gathered on 42 ADIS-C/P interviews. 
Inter-rater 
reliability was estimated by having the second rater 
listen to the audiotaped interviews and assign diagnoses 
blind to those of the first rater. The k coefficients were 
as follows: specific phobia ¼ 0.77, generalized anxiety 
disorder ¼ 0.90, attention deficit hyperactivity dis- 
order ¼ 0.93, generalized social anxiety disorder ¼ 1.00, 
1.00, nongeneralized social anxiety disorder ¼ 1.00, and 
major depression ¼ 1.00. Due to small sample sizes k 
coef ficients were not calculated for the remaining 
disorders. 
CLINICAL ANXIETY AS DEFINED BY SELF- 
REPORT SCALES AND SEMI-STRUCTURED 
INTERVIEW 
According to parent and child self-report question- 
naires (n ¼ 714), 22% and 20% of children, respec- 
tively, were above a suggested clinical cutof f on the 
SCARED whereas 18% and 12% of children exceeded 
clinical cutof fs on the SAS-C/SAS-A social anxiety 
questionnaires. Table 2 presents 12-month prevalence 
rates, as derived from the ADIS telephone interviews, 
with standard errors according to varying levels of 
impairment. Approximately 17% of children (n ¼ 32) 
presented with a clinical-level anxiety disorder and 
28% (n ¼ 53) presented with one or more of the 
disorders assessed in the study (i.e., anxiety disorder, 
depressive disorder, or ADHD). Among the children 
with anxiety disorders, 28% had more than one 
psychiatric disorder and 19% had a comorbid anxiety 
disorder. The most common disorder in this sample

was ADHD (12.6%) 
followed by specific phobia 
(10.0%) and social phobia (6.8%). When low impair- 
ment thresholds were applied, rates of any psychiatric 
disorder and any anxiety disorder were 44% and 35%, 
respectively. Adjustments to the impairment threshold 
most significantly impacted the anxiety disorders, 
reducing the rates of social phobia, specific phobia, 
and generalized anxiety disorder by at least 50%. As 
shown in Table 2, w2 tests for equality of proportions 
were used to examine the effect of requiring a ‘‘clinical’’ 
threshold for impairment. The formula, w2 ¼ n * p/ 
(1(cid:1)p) with 1 df [Fleiss, 1981] (see Appendix 1 for a full 
applied, where 
derivation of 
n ¼ number of children meeting criteria for a given 
anxiety disorder using a low threshold of impairment 
and p ¼ the difference between the proportion of 
children meeting criteria with the low threshold of 
(subthreshold) and the proportion of 
impairment 
individuals meeting criteria using a clinical level (‘‘a 
lot’’) of impairment. This analytic technique has been 
used in previous studies where impairment thresholds 
were adjusted and rates were compared [Romano et al., 
2001]. 
the inclusion of a stricter 
impairment threshold significantly reduced prevalence 
rates for social phobia and specific phobia. 




There were no gender dif ferences across disorders 
except for ADHD [w2 (1, n ¼ 190) ¼ 5.04, P o .05]. 
Boys had more ADHD diagnoses than girls did (8.9% 
versus 3.7%). There was not an age (i.e., younger 
children and adolescents) or ethnic difference (Cauca- 
sian and non-Caucasian) in the distribution of dis- 
orders across groups (data not shown). Ethnic groups 
were combined due to small sample sizes. 

Based on the sample of 190 telephone interview 
participants, approximately 35% (n ¼ 66) of children in 
our sample had received at least three sessions of 
counseling for problems such as anxiety, depression, 
ADHD, anger, enuresis, 
learning disabilities, sleep 
difficulties, or family issues at some point in their 
lifetimes. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were 
conducted to examine how various demographic 
characteristics and DSM-IV disorders (for categories 
that had at least five individuals) were related to 
treatment utilization (i.e., counseling/psychotherapy 
and psychotropic medication use) (Table 3). Gender, 
ethnicity, educational level, and age group were entered 
on the first step, and social anxiety disorder, specific 
phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, depressive dis- 
orders, and ADHD were included on the second step. 
The overall model for lifetime psychotherapy use was 
significant, [w2 (9, 185) ¼ 28.02, P o .001]; age group 
(adolescents), ethnicity (Caucasian), and ADHD were 
associated with an increased odds ratio (OR) of a 
lifetime history of counseling. The model for lifetime 
psychotropic medication use was also significant [w2 (9, 
185) ¼ 59.78, P o .001]. ADHD was the only variable 
associated with an increased OR of psychotropic use. 
The effect of comorbidity (i.e., presence of two or 
more disorders) was also assessed in two separate

anxiety, depression, or ADHD treated with medica- 
tions had either received selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors or 
stimulant medications. No parents 
reported that their child had received benzodiazepines, 
MAOI, tricyclics, or other antidepressant agents for 
these conditions. Among those children with a clinical 
level anxiety disorder during the past year, 31% had 
received some type of counseling or medication for 
anxiety-related problems. Approximately 40% of chil- 
dren with past-year depressive disorders had received 
counseling or medication for depression and 67% of 
children with a lifetime history of a depressive disorder 
had received services. Among children with a current 
ADHD diagnosis, 79% had received counseling or 
stimulant medication for ADHD. 
DISCUSSION 
DSM-IV childhood anxiety disorders are highly 
prevalent even outside of mental health settings. In 
the current study, the rate of anxiety disorders in a 
primary care setting was 35% when only a mild– 
moderate level of impairment was required. When a 
stricter criterion for disorder specific impairment was 
required (i.e., at least ‘‘a lot’’ of impairment), the rate 
is broadly 
dropped to 17%, which although high, 
consistent with findings from community samples. 
Kashani and Orvaschel [1988] reported a 6-month 
prevalence rate of 17.3% for any anxiety disorder, 7.3% 
for overanxious disorder, and 7.0% for separation 











anxiety disorder among adolescents. Reinherz et al. 
[1993] found a lifetime prevalence of 22.8% for social 
and simple phobia, 6.3% for PTSD, and 2.1% for 
OCD among 18 year olds. In the Bremen Adolescent 
study, a rate of 18.6% was found for a lifetime history 
of at least one anxiety disorder, the most common 
being phobias [Essau et al., 2000]. It is likely that 
prevalence rates would have been lower had we used a 
global assessment of impairment [Canino et al., 2004], 
and further reduced had we coupled global impairment 
with diagnosis-specific impairment. 
Further paralleling findings from other epidemiolo- 
gical studies of child psychiatric disorders in commu- 
nity samples, varying the threshold of impairment had 
the greatest impact on reducing rates of internalizing 
disorders such as simple phobias and social phobia 
[Romano et al., 2001; Shaffer et al., 1996; Simonof f et 
al., 1997]. Less stringent impairment thresholds may be 
more likely to capture individuals with internalizing 
disorders given that these symptoms (e.g., social fears 
and specific fears) are frequently less noticeable and 
outwardly disruptive. Similarly the boundary is often 
blurred when dif ferentiating pathological social fears 
from normative social concerns or when identifying 
clinically significant impairment, inevitably leading to a 
large number of childhood fears that are referred to as 
subthreshold. 
It was particularly noteworthy that anxiety disorders 
were the most prevalent, yet 
least often treated 
psychiatric condition. Families of children who had 
ADHD or depressive disorders had obtained counsel- 
ing more often than did families of children with 
anxiety disorders, although the rate of 
treatment 
utilization for children with depressive disorders was 
also considerably low. Overall, 72% of children with an 
impairing anxiety disorder had not received any kind of 
counseling. Still fewer individuals with anxiety (9%) 
had received medication treatment when compared to 
individuals with current depressive disorders (20%) and 
individuals with current ADHD (79%). Families most 
often received treatment for ADHD and somewhat less 
often for problems such as depression and anxiety. 
Logistic regression analyses supported these descrip- 
tive findings. ADHD was the only DSM-IV disorder 
associated with increased use of counseling/psy- 
chotherapy and psychotropic medication. Once again, 
it may be that families do not perceive internalizing 
behaviors 
serious or disruptive, despite 
endorsing a diagnosis of clinically significant impair- 
ment for their child. Also, pediatricians may be less 
aware of efficacious therapeutic options for child 
anxiety disorders and therefore less likely to encourage 
treatment. Furthermore, there may be more systemic 
barriers that families encounter when seeking treat- 
insurance 
ment 
coverage). The explanation for 
this gap between 
prevalence and treatment requires additional study. 


Other significant predictors of psychotherapy use 
included ethnicity (Caucasians) and age of child 
(adolescent). Although findings 
from studies are 
inconsistent, some data support that ethnic minorities 
are less likely to receive counseling and psychotropic 
medication when compared to Caucasians [Kataoka 
et al., 2002; Lavigne et al., 1998; Rushton and 
Whitmire, 2001; Zito et al., 2003]. These patterns of 
utilization are often explained by dif ferences 
in 
treatment acceptability, stigma, detection, and help- 
seeking behaviors across ethnic groups. In a study 
exploring parental beliefs about the causes of child 
mental health problems, it was found that parents of 
ethnic minority youths were generally less likely than 
parents of non-Hispanic Caucasians to endorse biop- 
sychosocial etiologies and more likely to report socio- 
logical 
friends, American culture, 
prejudice, economic problems); a pattern that may 
make ethnic minority parents 
likely to seek 
mainstream mental health services or may lead to 
conflict when they are met with services that espouse 
biopsychosocial explanatory models [Yeh et al., 2004]. 
The increased likelihood for adolescents 
to have 
received psychotherapy may be attributed to the fact 
that we assessed lifetime utilization. It may also be that 
families become more likely to seek services if a child’s 
problem has persisted over a significant period. 



The gap between prevalence and treatment utiliza- 
tion for anxiety disorders is apparent and worrisome for 
several reasons. First, longitudinal studies with clinical 
and community samples suggest that anxiety disorders 
during youth are associated with risk for later (i.e., 
chronic) anxiety, major depression, and substance abuse 
[Costello et al., 2003; Essau et al., 2002; Pine et al., 
1998; Stein et al., 2001]. Second, varying forms of 
childhood anxiety are associated with educational 
underachievement, 
low self-esteem, and loneliness 
[Fordham and Stevenson-Hinde, 1999; Van Ameringen 
et al., 2003; Woodward and Fergusson, 2001]. Third, 
childhood anxiety may intensify the impact of com- 
monly co-occurring disorders such as ADHD [Jensen 
et al., 2001]. Efforts to improve identification and 
treatment delivery seem to be a logical next step to 
improving short- and long-term outcomes for youth 
with anxiety disorders. 

Although we drew randomly from a complete roster 
of primary care pediatrics patients and were able to 
demonstrate that responders and non-responders were 
not dissimilar on a number of attributes, the general- 
this study is nonetheless limited. The 
izability of 
interviewed sample was relatively small 
in number, 
predominantly Caucasian and educated. Another lim- 
itation is the fact that diagnoses were based solely on 
parents’ reports. Research shows that whenever parents 
and children are assessed independently, reports are 
frequently discrepant 
[Grills and Ollendick, 2003; 
Verhulst et al., 1997]; this seems to be true for both 
internalizing and externalizing disorders although 


agreement seems greater for behaviors that are more 
observable (i.e., externalizing behaviors) 
[Silverman 
and Eisen, 1992]. It is possible that rates of anxiety 
disorders could have been higher, given that children 
internal 
are sometimes cited as better reporters of 
distress [Sourander et al., 1999]. The reporting of some 
anxiety symptoms (such as social avoidance in social 
anxiety disorder), however, may be associated with a 
child’s self-presentation concerns and therefore less 
likely to be disclosed [DiBartolo et al., 1998]. 
The study also carries the limitations associated with 
self-report 
telephone 
instruments and the use of 
interviews represents a separate limitation. The psy- 
chometric properties of the ADIS-C delivered via 
telephone to parents have not been investigated. In a 
study of the comparability of telephone and face-to- 
face interviews with young adults (24 years old) using 
the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophre- 
nia for School-Age Children (KIDDIE-SADS) [Cham- 
bers et al., 1985], Rohde et al. [1997] found that the 
reliability was excellent for anxiety disorders and very 
good for major depressive disorder and substance use 
disorders. 

Lastly, this study is limited by the absence of a 
structured, 
reliable assessment of 
functional impairment. In the current study, as part 
of the ADIS-C/P interview, parents were asked simply 
to respond with ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ to disorder-specific 
impairment 
functioning 
in dif ferent domains of 
(school, home life, friendships, health) and then to 
give an overall interference rating for that disorder. 
judgment and consensus meetings yielded 
Clinical 
impairment ratings that reflected absent, subthreshold 
(mild to moderate impairment), and clinically signifi- 
cant diagnoses. Efforts directed at operationalizing 
‘‘clinically meaningful’’ 
impairment accompanied by 
standardized self-report assessments reflecting this 
construct will help to advance the reliability and 
validity of epidemiological research in this area. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Childhood anxiety disorders are common in the 
pediatric primary care setting but 
frequently go 
undetected and untreated. Pediatricians are in a 
challenging position as gatekeepers who bear the onus 
of identifying and referring children with psychosocial 
disorders, but simultaneously are met with increasing 
demands on their time and restricted access to specialty 
mental health services [Blumenthal et al., 1999; Reid et 
al., 1996]. The use of brief and valid screening 
instruments may facilitate this process, but efforts to 
improve identification raise ethical concerns. Incum- 
bent with increased identification is the increased need 
for services from a mental health care system that is 
currently underfunded and overburdened [Stephenson, 
2000]. Furthermore, treatments with known ef ficacy 
are delivered mostly in specialty clinics and therefore 
remain difficult to access. Research aimed at improving 
identification and detection must be accompanied by 
efforts to develop interventions that are empirically 
validated, accessible, and effective across settings. In 
particular, 
it may be worthwhile to investigate the 
effectiveness and acceptability of abbreviated cognitive 
behavioral strategies to treat anxiety disorders as well as 
the use of such techniques to augment pharmacother- 
apy options [e.g., Chavira and Stein, 2002]. Data show 
that pediatricians are already prescribing a significant 
proportion of psychotropic medications [Pincus et al., 
1998; Rushton and Whitmire, 2001], but medication 
alone may be less than optimal for some disorders. 
Studies currently in progress will provide data regard- 
ing the efficacy of combined pharmacotherapy and 
behavioral interventions when compared to monother- 
apy. Equally important will be studies that attempt to 
transport efficacious treatments for childhood disor- 
ders to primary care settings [Weisz, 2000].
