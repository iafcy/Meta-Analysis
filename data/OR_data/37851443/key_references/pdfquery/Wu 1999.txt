Depression is one of the leading risk factors for suicide 
in children and adolescents (Brent et al., 1993; Shaffer 
et al., 1996b), as well as a source of serious distress and 
impairment (Weissman et al., 1991). Improving the 
early identification and treatment of youths with depres 
sion, therefore, has both clinical and policy implications.

Identifying the patterns of service use or nonuse in this 
vulnerable population is the first step to improving men 
tal health services. There has been limited research in 
this specific area, and consequently little is known about 
the service use patterns of children and adolescents with 
depressive disorders in the community. 
Many children with a need for mental health services 
do not receive professional help (Burn s, 1991 ; Burns 
et al., 1995; Costello, 1989; Gould et al., 1980; Staghezza 
Jaramillo et al., 1995; Whitaker et al., 1990) or appro 
priate services (Saxe et al., 1988). However, few studies 
have examined the relationship between types of psychiat 
ric disorders and patterns of service utilization (Anderson 
et al., 1987; Cohen et al., 1991; Cuffe et al., 1995; Koot 
and Verhulst, 1992; Verhulst and Ende, 1997). The find 
ings are also inconsistent. For example, some studies 
found that children with "externalizing" disorders, such 
as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct dis 
order, and oppositional defiant disorder are more likely 



to be referred to and to use mental health services than 
children without these disorders. On the other hand, 
«internalizing" disorders, such as depression and anxiety, 
are not generally associated with service use (Anderson 
et al., 1987; Cohen et al., 1991; Koot and Verhulst, 1992). 
In Verhulst and Ende's recent study in the Netherlands 
(1997), both externalizing and internalizing problems 
made unique contributions to service use. However, the 
effect of externalizing disorders was stronger than that of 
the internalizing disorders. Studies also found that 
impairment had an impact on child use of mental health 
services, which is independent of the psychiatric dis 
orders (Bird et al., 1996; Leaf et al., 1996; Staghezza 
Jaramillo et al., 1995). 
Besides the type of disorder and impairment, some 
characteristics of family, parent, and youth have been 
.found to affect child service utilization patterns, including 
the child's age (Barber et al., 1992; Cohen and Hesselbart, 
1993; Zahner and Daskalakis, 1997) , gender (Barber 
et al., 1992; Cuffe et al., 1995; Garralda and Bailey, 1988; 
Zahner and Daskalakis, 1997), ethnicity (Cohen and 
Hesselbart, 1993 ; Cuffe et al., 1995; Neighbors et al., 
1992; Zahner and Daskalakis , 1997), family socioeco 
nomic status (Cohen and Hesselbart, 1993; Garralda and 
Bailey, 1988;John et al., 1995; Koot and Verhulst, 1992), 
child physical illness (john et al., 1995), parental use of 
mental health servicesfor psychiatric problems (Garralda 
and Bailey, 1988), and parental perceived burden (Angold 
et al., 1998). Inasmuch as most of these factors are related 
to disorders as well as to service utilization, it is important 
to control for them when assessing the relationship be 
tween type of disorder and patterns of service utilization. 
In Andersen's model of health services utilization 
among adults (Andersen, 1995; Andersen and Newman, 
1973), an important determinant is the "need" for ser 
vices, which includes perceived need and evaluated need 
(diagnosis). Children's pathways to mental health ser 
vices, however, are more complicated than those of adults 
in that children do not usually decide to seek mental 
health services. Others, usually parents and teachers, and 
in some instances, other agents, such as the police 
(Horwitz, 1982), play the most important role in both 
identifying a child's mental health problems and obtain 
ing professional help. Their attitudes toward and percep 
tions of children's needs for services have a major impact 
on child service use decisions (Angold et al., 1998; 
Costello and Janiszewski, 1990; Hoberman, 1992; Tarico 
et al., 1989; Zahner and Daskalakis, 1997). 
Recent studies have shown that more than three 
fourths of children using mental health services were 
seen in school, and for many of them the school-based 
service is the only source of care received (Burns et al., 
1995; Leafet al., 1996; Staghezza-Jaramillo et al., 1995). 
Perhaps for this reason, school-based health and mental 
health centers continue to grow (Lear, 1996). Schools 
provide a single point of access to services in a non 
threatening atmosphere and thus reduce the barriers to 
children receiving help for emotional, behavioral, and 
drug-related problems (Flaherty et al., 1996). However, 
few studies have examined and compared the impact of 
specific psychiatric disorder and risk factors on the utili 
zation of mental health services within or outside the 
school setting (Angold et al., 1998; Koot and Verhulst, 
1992; Zahner et al., 1992; Zahner and Daskalakis, 1997). 
To examine the unmet needs of children with depres 
sive disorders, the service use patterns of depressed chil 
dren were compared with those of children with disruptive 
disorders. These comparisons were conducted on chil 
dren's use of specialty mental health services, school-based 
services, as well as any service use for emotional, behav 
ioral, and drug-related problems. The analysis addresses 
4 questions: (1) How do children with depressive disor 
ders receive mental health services? (2) Are the patterns 
of service utilization the same for children with depres 
sive disorders as for those with disruptive disorders? (3) 
If there are differences, do these differences exist for spe 
cialty mental health services, as well as school-based ser 
vices? (4) Finally, if there are differences, can they be 
explained by demographic, familial, parental, and indi 
vidual characteristics or by perceived service needs? The 
answers to these questions will provide a more thorough 
understanding of the unmet needs of children with 
depressive disorders, identify various factors affecting 
children's use of mental health services, and provide cli 
nicians and policymakers with useful information to 
help improve services for children in need, especially 
those with depression. 


Data were obtained in the National Institute of Mental H ealth 
(NIMH)-funded Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and 
Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA) Study (Dulcan , 1996; Lahey 
et aI., 1996), a multi site community survey conducted in 1992. Prob 
ability samples of children aged 9 to 17years were obtained in 4 geo 
graphic areas:(l ) Hamden, East Haven, and West Haven, Connecticut 
(N = 314); (2) DeKalb, Rockdale, and Henry counties, Georgia (N = 


299); (3) Westchester County, New York (N = 360); and (4) San 
Juan , Puerto Rico (N = 312). The 1,285 parent-child pairs interviewed 
represented 84% of tho se eligible (Lahey et al., 1996). Fifty-three 
percent of the sample were boys, and the mean age of the children in 
the sample was 12.9 years (SD = 2.6). 
Structured, in-person interviews were conducted in families' homes 
separately for parents and children. The protocol included the NIMH 
D iagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DI SC) Version 2.3 
(Shaffer er al., 1996a) and a Service Utilization and Risk Factors int er 
view (Goodman et al., 1998 ; Leafer al., 1996). 


All parents and children were asked about mental health and sub 
stance use services used by children, both in the previous year as well 
as in their lifetime. However, only parents were asked about chil 
dren's use of specific types of services (Leaf et al., 1996). On the basis 
of information from both parents and children, the following 3 types 
of service utilization in lifetime and past year were used in th is stu dy: 
Mental Health Services. A child was seen by a psychiatrist , psychol 
ogist, or counselor in his/her private office, or received treatment in a 
psychiatric or drug and alcohol outpatient clinic, or stayed overnight 
in a hospital or residential treatment center for psychiatric or sub 
stance use problems. 
School-Based MentalHealth Services. A child used school-based ser 
vicesfor emotional, behavioral, and/or drug use problems . The services 
include both individual counseling and special classesor programs . 
Any Service. A child used any of the following services for emo 
tional or behavioral problems or alcohol or drug use: (1) mental 
health services, (2) medical professionals, (3) school-based services, 
(4) social services, (5) clergy,or (6) other (e.g., spiritualists, herbalists). 

Parent and child perceptions of the child's need for services for 
emotional, behavioral, and/or drug problems were based on the ir 
own reports. Teacher's perceptions of th e child's service need and 
polic e contact (for anyth ing but minor traffic violations) were based 
on reports from either parent or child. 

Psychiatric Disorders and Impairment. Children's psychopathology 
in the previous 6 months was assessed by the DISC (version 2.3) . 
Aggregated data from both par ent and child interviews were used, 
that is, a diagnosis was considered to be positive if symptoms reported 
by the parent and/or the child , when combined, met diagnostic crite 
ria. Impairment was included in the definition of each psychiatr ic 
disord er. In this study, a child was considered to have positive results 
for any disorder when (1) DSM-III-R criteria for th at disorder were 
met, (2) there was an indication of diagnosis-specific imp airment, 
and (3) either parent or child interviewer ratings on the nonclinician 
Global Assessment Scale for Children were below 71 (Shaffer et al., 
1996a). Depressive disorders included major depression and dysthy 
mia. Disruptive behavior disorders included attention-deficit hyper 
activity disorder, oppositional defiant disorde r, and conduct disorder. 
Any other disorders included any of 24 other disorders assessed by the 
DISC (Shaffer er al., 1996a). 
The Columbia Impai rment Scale is a 13-item scale covering inter 
personal relations and funct ioning at work, in school , and at home. 
Items are scored from 0 ("no problem") to 4 ("a vety bad pr oblem") 
(Bird et al., 1993, 1996). The internal reliability of the scale is 0.83. 

The scale was based on both parent and child reports and was dichoto 
mized at the optimal threshold ~6 recommended by Bird et al. (1996) 
to distingu ish between those with definite impairment and all others . 
PhysicalIllness. Thirteen childhood illnesses such as diabetes, heart 
disease, asthma, allergy, and others were included in the parent 
report. A dichotomized variable was created with two or more types 
of illnesses coded as 1 and none or one as O. 
Child Demographics. Child demograph ics include gender, age, and 
ethnicity. Children were divided into 4 ethnic groups: non-Hispani c 
wh ite, African-American, Hi spani c, and other. Three dummy-coded 
variables-African-Am erican, Hi spanic , and other-were created for 
logistic regression analyses with non-Hispanic white as the reference 
group. 

Low family income was defined as receiving public assistance or 
having an annual household income of less than $18 ,000 (1 SD 
below the mean) for the 3 U .S. sites. Because income in Puerto Rico 
was co nsiderably lower th an at the other 3 sites, low income in 
Puerto Rico was defined as receiving public assistance or having an 
annual household income of less than $4,000 (1 SD below the mean 
of Puerto Rico). Mo ther's education was dichotomized with 13 or 
more years of schooling coded as 1 in th e analysis. Information about 
family insurance coverage (either privat e or public, such as Medicaid 
or Medicare) was obtained from paren ts. Mothers' or fathe rs' use of 
mental health services was determined by having "ever seen a psychi 
atr ist , psychologist, social worker, doctor, or other health profes 
sional, for a psychological or emotional problem." 

Univariate analyses compared the service use patterns, identified 
need for services, and child and family characteristics of depressed 
child ren and childr en with disruptive behavior disorders..Because 
comorbidity existed between the 2 types of disorders , children who 
had eith er type of disorder were divided into 3 groups : (1) depressive 
only (n = 44), (2) disruptive only (n = 96 ), and (3) both depressive 
and disruptive disorders (n = 36). Children withou t any disorder (n = 
1,016) served as a reference group. 
LOgistic regression analyses predicting child mental health service 
use were conducted for the total sample in 5 steps. In each model, 
study site, mother's education, family income, health insurance status, 
and child's age, sex, and ethnicity were controlled. In model I , depres 
sive disorder was entered into the equati on . In model 2, disruptive dis 
order was entered into the equation. In model 3, both depressive and 
disruptive disorders were sim ultaneously entered to take comorbidity 
into account . The odds ratio for each disorder shows the effect of one 
disorder while controlling for the effect of the other. In model 4, all 
variables in model 3, plus child 's other psychiatric disorders, impair 
m ent, and lifetime chronic ph ysical illnes ses, were simultaneously 
entered so we could examine the un ique contribution of depressive or 
disruptive disorders while controlling for other mental and physical ill 
nesses as well as impairment. Finally, model 5 added perceived need, 
police contact, and parental use of m ental health services into the 
equation. These latter variables were entered into the model so we 
could examine whether recognition of child psychopathology by par 
ent and oth ers is relat ed to service use and whether the difference 
between depressive and disruptive disorders was due to the fact that 
children with disruptive disorders were more easily identified and 
labeled as being in need of help than those with depressive disorders. 
The differences among the 4 sites in the MECA study have been 
previously discussed (Lahey et al., 1996). In all the logistic regression 



analyses, the effect ofsire was controlled. Also, the interactions ofsire 
with depressive disorders, disruptive disorders, and important demo 
graphic variables were added to the final model to exami ne whether 
the ma in findings still held . 


Individual and family characteristics were first com 
pared among children with depressive but not disrup 
tive disorders (n = 44) , children with disruptive but not 
depressive disorders (n = 96), children with both disor 
ders (n =36), and those without any disorder (n = 1,016) 
(Table 1). 
The ethnic distribution of the Disruptive Only group 
was significantly different from that of the No Disorder 
group. Therewere more African-Americans and fewer 
Hispanics in me Disruptive Only group than in the No 
Disorder group: Children with depressive disorders 
tended to be older (mean age = 14.3) than those without 
depression (12.9 in the No Disorder group and 12.6 in 
the Disruptive Only group). As expected, more girls met 
criteria for depression and more boys met criteria for dis 
ruptive disorders. Fifty-nine percent of children with 
depression only and 31% of children in the Disruptive 
Only group were girls. Among chi ldren with either 
depressive or disruptive disorders or both disorders, a 
high proportion of children (more than 60%) also met 
criteria for other disorders. Children with either depres 
sive or disruptive disorders were also more likely to be 
impaired than those with no disorder. Finally, children 
with both depressive and disruptive disorders were most 
likely to be impaired (67%). No significant difference 
was found on physical illnesses across groups. 
The comparison of family and parental characteristics 
across groups showed that the mothers of children with 
both depressive and disruptive disordershad lesseducation

than mothers in other groups. Mothers' rates of mental 
health service use were higher in the Depressive Only 
group and Disruptive Only group than in the No Disorder 
group. No significant differences were found in income, 
health insurance, or fathers' use of mental health services. 
Table 2 shows children's service use patterns by type 
of disorder. For both lifetime and past year service use, 
children with either one or both disorders used more ser 
vices than those with no disorder. For lifetime service 
use, children with disruptive disorder, whether they had 
a depressive disorder or not (Disruptive Only and Both 
groups), were more likely to report receiving mental 
health services(56.1%) than those in the DepressiveOnly 
group (38.6%). However, this pattern was not found in 
school-based service use. For service use in the past year, 
no significant difference was found among children with 
different types of disorders. 
One explanation of the findings in Table 2 may be 
that children with disruptive disorders are more likely to 
use mental health services because they (or their parents) 
perceive greater need for services than those with depres 
sive disorders. To test this hypothesis, the perceived 
needs for services were compared among children with 
different disorders (Table 3). As we expected, signifi 
cantly higher rates of service need recognition by par 
ents, teachers, and children themselves were found in 
children with either or both disorders than those with 
no disorder. Also, children with either or both disorders 
were more likely to report police contact than those with 
no disorder. Parents of children with disruptive dis 
orders (with or without depressive disorder) were more 
likely to perceive child service need (51.5%) than those 
with depressive disorder only (36.4%). The highest rate 
of parent-perceived need was found in children with 
both depressive and disruptive disorders (61.1 %), and a 
similar pattern was found for police contact. However, a 
different pattern was found for child-perceived mental 
health service need. Children with depressive disorders 
(with or without disruptive disorders) were more likely 
to perceive a need for services (35.0%) than those with 
disruptive disorders only (22.9%). No significant differ 
ence was found between the 2 disorders for teachers' per 
ceived need (reported by parents and children). 

To explore further the relationship between types of 
disorders and service use, we conducted logistic regres 
sion analyses to assess the effect of each specific category 
of disorder, adjusting for the effects of other factors. The 
results are summarized in Table 4. 
Mental Health Services. The resultsfor mental health ser 
vice use show striking differences between depressive and 
disruptive disorders. When the 2 types of disorders were 
entered into the equation (model 3), the adjusted odds 
ratio (AOR) for disruptive disorders (6.05, p < .001) was 
about 3 times that for depressive disorders (2.00, p < .05). 



Results in model 4 showed that impairment, other psychi 
atric disorders, and chronic illness were also significantly 
associated with child mental health service use. Control 
ling for them, the AOR for disruptive disorder reduced to 
4.01 (p < .001), while depressive disorders were no longer 
significantly related to mental health service use (AOR = 
1.35). ModelS assumes that children with disruptive dis 
orders are more easily identified and labeled as being in 
need of help. If this assumption is true, the effect of dis 
ruptive disorders on service use will disappear or diminish 
after control for perception of child service need. The 
effect of disruptive disorders still held in this final model 
(AOR = 3.44, P < .001). Also significantly associated with 
child mental health service use were child physical illness; 
mother's lifetime mental health service use; perceived child 
mental health service need by children, parents, and 
teachers; and police contact. In addition, African-American 
children were less likely than whites to use mental health 
services (AOR = 0.57, P < .05). Older children (15 or 
older) were more likely to use services than younger ones 
(9-11 years old) (AOR = 1.78, P < .05). 
School-Based Services. No difference between the effects 
of depressive and disruptive disorders was found on 
school-based mental health service use. For example, in 
model 3, theAOR was 3.14 (p < .001) for disruptive dis 
orders and 2.88 (p < .001) for depressive disorders. When 
all the other factors were controlled (model 5), neither of 
the 2 disorders remained significant. Teacher-perceived 
need is the strongest predictor of school-based service use 
(AOR = 3.90, P < .001), followed by child-perceived 
(AOR = 2.65, P < .001) and parent-perceived need (AOR = 
2.18) for mental health services. 
Any Service Use. The findings for use of any services 
were quite similar to those for mental health service use, 
although the difference between depressive and disrup 
tive disorders was not as striking. In the final model (5), 
the effects of depressive disorder became nonsignificant 
(AOR = 1.69), while the effects of disruptive disorders 
still held (AOR = 2.55,p < .01). 
The stronger effect of disruptive disorders on mental 
health service utilization than depressive disorders was 
found for lifetime service use only, and thus it is possible 
that this difference was due to the greater chronicity of 
disruptive disorders. Using age of onset of each disorder 
reported by both parent and child, we created a proxy of 
the "duration" for each disorder and conducted addi 
tional analyses to control for the duration of disorders. 
The results indicate that the difference between the 2 
types of disorders still held. 
In addition to controlling for site effect in each model, 
we also conducted analyses with interactions of site with 
depressive, disruptive, and some important sociodem 
ographic variables controlled. The results showed no signif 
icant interaction, and the main findings remained the same. 

This study examines the effects of disorders, primarily 
depression and disruptive disorders, on the use of services 
for emotional, behavioral, and/or drug-related problems 
by children and adolescents in a community sample.

The results of the study highlight the unmet service 
needs of children with depressive disorders and indicate 
possible ways to meet their needs. 

In contrast to children with disruptive disorders, chil 
dren with depressivedisorders are lesslikely to receive spe- 
cialty mental health services. This is especially true for 
those with depressive disorders alone . This pattern sug 
gests that children with internalizing problems are under 
identified or underreferred. The pattern we observed is 
consistent with findings from other studies (Anderson 
et al., 1987; Cohen er al., 1991; Koot and Verhulst, 1992). 
However, this studj went beyond the previous studies in 



several aspects. Unlike the studies of Anderson et al. 
(1987) and Cohen et al. (1991), this study took cornor 
bidity between depressive and disruptive disorders into 
account. Also, different from Koot and Verhulst's study 
(1992), this study used DSM-III-R criteria, measured by 
the DISC, to assess child psychopathology. Finally, addi 
tional potential confounding variables, such as impair 
ment, perceived needs, physical illness, and parental 
mental health service use, were controlled for in our mul 
tivariate analyses. Logistic regression analyses were con 
ducted hierarchically to determine whether the difference 
between the 2 types of disorders could be explained by the 
effects of other disorders; by level of impairment; by 
familial, parental, and irldividual characteristics; or by 
perceived child service needs. The results indicate that 
after controlling all the confounding factors, children 
with disruptive disorders still appeared to be more likely . 
to use mental health services than children without dis 
ruptive disorders, while the presence of depressive dis 
orders was not associated with receiving mental health 
services. The findings from testing the multiple-step 
model indicate that the effects of child psychiatric dis 
orders on child mental health serviceuse are partially indi 
rect, being mediated through impairment and perceived 
needs. When impairment was entered into the equation, 
it contributed significantly to mental health service use 
and reduced the effect of disorders. When perceivedmen 
tal health serviceneeds were entered into the equation, the 
effect of impairment became insignificant. 
Another unique aspect of our analysis is that, in 
addition to service use, we compared perceived need for 
services among children with different disorders. The 
results showed that, while depressed children used 
mental health services less, they acrually reported more 
need for services than those with disruptive disorders. 
These findings further highlight the unmet need of 
depressed children. 

A comparison between children's use of non-school 
based mental health services and their use of school 
based services shows that, after control for familial , 
parental, and individual factors, the difference between 
the effect of disruptive disorders and depressivedisorders 
on service use is significant regarding the use of specialty 
mental services, but not for the use of school-based ser 
vices. Moreover, the findings suggest that children's use of 
school-based services is less likely than use of mental 
health services outside of school to be influenced by 
demographic and parental factors. Ethnicity, child's age, 
and maternal use of mental health services are signifi 
cantly associated with child mental health service use but 
have no effect on use of school services. These findings 
are consistent with those reported in other studies which 
showed that school-based services are most widely used 
by children and adolescents and are easier to access 
(Burns et al., 1995; Flaherty et al., 1996; Lear, 1996; 
Staghezza-Jaramillo et al., 1995). These results suggest 
that unlike children's use of specialty mental health ser 
vices, children with depressivedisorders did not appear to 
have more difficulties in accessing school services for 
their emotional and behavioral problems. Therefore, 
expanding and improving school-based mental health 
services can be potentially helpful in meeting the specific 
needs of depressed children and adolescents. 

Consistent with previous studies (Angold et al., 1998; 
Costello and Janiszewski, 1990; Zahner and Daskalakis, 
1997), our findings indicate the importance of parents 
and teachers in initiating children's use of mental health 
services. Teacher's perception of child service needs was 
strongly associated with the use of both school and non 
school mental health services. Parents' perceived needs 
had a stronger impact on children receiving mental 
health services outside of school than on receipt of school 
services. In our final model, when the perceived needs 
were entered into the equation, with the exception of dis 
ruptive disorder, the effects of psychopathology and . 
impairment on serviceuse disappeared.These findings are 
similar to those reported by Angoldand colleagues (1998). 

It should be noted that the conclusions drawn from 
this study are limited in several ways. First, because of 
the cross-sectional design of the MECA study, we can 
not address pathways to mental health services and no 
causal relationships can be determined regarding service 
use and perceived service need. A longitudinal study is 
necessary to confirm these findings. Also, while the anal 
yses were conducted on service utilization, no conclu 
sion can be made about the effectiveness of the services 
offered or received. However, the large size of the MECA 
sample, the detail of the psychiatric disorders measured 
by the NIMH DISC, and the rich information on ser 
vice utilization for mental health problems gave us a 


wonderful opportunity to explore the pattern of service 
utilization and the need for mental health services for 
children with different types of psychiatric disorders. 
The results provide useful information for clinicians as 
well as policymakers. 

Our findings indicate that patterns of service use are 
influenced not only by sociodemographic factors but 
also by types of disorders. Among children and adoles 
cents, depressive disorders are less likely to be identified 
than disruptive disorders. Consequently, children with 
depressive disorders are less likely to be referred to men 
tal health professionals. In future service planning, poli 
cymakers and clinicians need to find more effectiveways 
to identify and appropriately refer depressed children. 
The findings of this study indicate the important role of 
school-based services in meeting children's needs for 
mental health services. School-based services provide an 
efficient locus for the cost-effective delivery of mental 
health services to children. Existing services should be 
improved and new services developed to meet children's 
unmet needs. For example, there is a need for school 
based screening instruments to identify children's psy 
chiatric disorders at an early stage. Finally, parent's or 
teacher's perceived need for child mental health services 
plays a critical role in children's obtaining mental health 
services. Further mental health education should be 
offered to parents and teachers, which in turn will 
improve early identification and treatment of children 
with psychiatric disorders.

Wu and colleagues (1999) illuminate the difficulty chil 
dren with depression too often experience in "getting 
noticed," let alone in receiving treatment. Specifically, 
this latest MECA report confirms the paucity of atten 
tion and services for children with depression whe n 
comp ared with those with attention deficit, oppositional 
defiant , or conduct disorders. Perhaps more troubl ing, 
while juveniles with depression recognized their need for 
mental health services, 
their parents and teachers 
frequently were unaware of the child's depression. 
Disruptive disorders, by definition , impact the lives of 
others, who often react by demanding intervention. 
Fortunately, for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder 
part icularly, we can respond with effective treatments 
th at benefit the child as well as parents and teachers. 
Historically, treatm ents of juvenile depression have been 
less predictable, rapid, or efficacious. Parents, teachers, 
and even child and adolescent psychiatrists may be less 
aggressive or able to identify something, such as depres-

sion, which usually distresses the individual afflicted more 
than others in the environment. Given the powerful im 
pact of a depression on a juvenile, Wu and colleagues' 
study reiterates the impo rtance of detecting depression 
even though it may not immediately distress others. 
Consistent with other epidemiological samples, girls 
were almost twice as likely to be depressed as boys. 
Sensitivity to adolescent girls' distress manifested in 
depression or dysthymia continues to lag behind efforts 
observed for boys manifesting behavioral problems dur 
ing this same age span. Similarly, ethnic differences were 
described in this report, as disruptive disorders were iden 
tified more often in African-Americans than in other eth 
nic groups. These discrepancies pun ctuate the need for 
bett er identification and for equitable treatment of 
diverse juveniles with various psychiatric disorders. 
Ultimately,Wu et al. suggest that expanding services 
on-site at the school would be one appropriate strategy 
for improving treatme nt of juven ile dep ression. As 
schools absorb increasing responsibility for th e care of 
our children (somewhat as a consequence of managed 
care, fragmented or overworked families, etc.), school 
based services represent an effort to include caregivers 
such as psychiatrists to participate in the creation of a 
school "community" where multiple adults interact to 
care for "its" children. Contemp orary mental health 
models have similarly recognized the need for integration
