Treatment of mental disorders for adolescents in Mexico City 
G Borges,a C Benjet,a ME Medina-Mora,a R Orozco b & PS Wang c 


In Mexico,1 as elsewhere, only a minor- 
ity of adults with psychiatric disorders 
receive some form of treatment.2–5 
However, it is unclear to what extent 
this situation is similar for Mexican 
adolescents. Some studies of adult popu- 
lations have shown that younger adult 
cohorts are more likely to receive care 
than older cohorts.6 However, other 
studies, mostly conducted in developed 
countries, have begun to shed light on 
important shortfalls in the mental health 
care received by adolescents.7–12 
In 2001–2002, the National Insti- 
tute of Psychiatry in Mexico conducted 
the Mexico National Comorbidity 
Survey,1 which is part of WHO’s World 
Mental Health Survey Initiative.13,14 
Results for the urban Mexican adult 
population showed that fewer than one 
in five respondents with a 12-month 
prevalence of a psychiatric disorder used 
any service during the previous year and 
only one in every two respondents who 
used services received care that met 
minimal standards for adequacy.3 In 
2005, the National Institute of Psychia- 
try in Mexico conducted the Mexican 
Adolescent Mental Health Survey 
employing similar methodology.15 We 
report here the rate of mental health 
service use in the previous year among 
these adolescents, the adequacy of treat- 
ments, and potential determinants of 
service use and treatment adequacy. 
Methods 
Participants 
The survey was designed to be repre- 
sentative of the 1 834 661 adolescents 
aged 12–17 years that are permanent 
residents of private housing units in 
the Mexico City metropolitan area. The 
final sample included 3005 adolescent 
respondents selected from a stratified 
multistage area probability sample. In 
all strata, the primary sampling units 
were census count areas cartographi- 
cally defined and updated by the Insti- 
tuto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía 
e Informática.16 All households within 
these city block units with adolescents 
aged 12–17 years were selected. One 
eligible member from each of these 
households was randomly selected. The 
response rate of eligible respondents 
was 71%. 
Procedures 
Fieldwork involving face-to-face in- 
terviews in the homes of the selected 
participants was carried out from March 
through August 2005 by interview- 
ers who had received training in the 
Composite International Diagnostic 
Interview according to the WHO pro- 
tocol stipulated for participating World 
Mental Health countries. A verbal and 
written explanation of the study was 
given to both parents and adolescents. 
Interviews were administered only to 
those participants for whom a signed 
informed consent from a parent and/or 
legal guardian and the adolescent was 
obtained. Although an adult had to be 
present in the home during the course 
of the interview, interviewers attempted 
to interview the adolescent privately, i.e. 
in another room. All study participants 
were given a mental health resources 
card with the contact information for

Objective This study describes the prevalence, adequacy and correlates of 12-month mental health service use among participants 
in the Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey. 
Methods The authors conducted face-to-face household surveys of a probability sample of 3005 adolescents aged 12–17 years 
residing in the Mexico City metropolitan area during 2005. The prevalence of mental health disorders and the use of services were 
assessed with the computer-assisted adolescent version of the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. 
Correlates of service use and adequate treatment were identified in logistic regression analyses that took into account the complex 
sample design and weighting process. 
Findings Less than one in seven respondents with psychiatric disorders used any mental health services during the previous year. 
Respondents with substance-use disorders reported the highest prevalence of service use and those with anxiety disorders the 
lowest. Approximately one in every two respondents receiving any services obtained treatment that could be considered minimally 
adequate. 
Conclusion We found large unmet needs for mental health services among adolescents with psychiatric disorders in Mexico City. 
Improvements in the mental health care of Mexican youth are urgently needed.

different institutions where they could 
seek services should they wish to do 
so. The Human Subjects Committee 
of the National Institute of Psychiatry 
approved the recruitment, consent and 
field procedures. 
Measures 
Psychiatric disorders, service use and 
potential correlates were assessed in the 
Mexican Adolescent Mental Health 
Survey using the computer-assisted 
adolescent version of the World Mental 
Health Composite International Diag- 
nostic Interview (WMH-CIDI-A).17 
The WMH-CIDI-A was adapted from 
the adult version WMH-CIDI 3.0 used 
in the Mexico National Comorbidity 
Survey and validated in diverse coun- 
tries and cultures.18 The diagnostic 
sections are similar to the adult version 
except that the language has been sim- 
plified to be more easily understood by 
younger respondents, examples were 
made more age appropriate (e.g. refer- 
ences to school instead of work), and 
criteria were changed to accommodate 
caveats made for adolescents in the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition 
(DSM-IV). 
Prevalence of mental disorders 
The 12-month prevalence of the fol- 
lowing categories of psychiatric disor- 
ders were recorded: affective disorders 
(major depressive disorder, bipolar I and 
II disorder and dysthymia with hierar- 
chy); anxiety disorders (panic disorder, 
agoraphobia without panic disorder, so- 
cial phobia, specific phobia, separation 
anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety dis- 
order and posttraumatic stress disorder); 
impulse control disorders (intermittent 
explosive disorder, oppositional-defiant 
disorder, conduct disorder and atten- 
tion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder); and 
substance use disorders (alcohol and 
drug abuse and dependence). 
Mental health service use 
Information was collected about the use 
of mental health services, including the 
type of professionals visited, use of self- 
help, support groups or hotlines, and 
school-based programmes. The number 
of treatment visits made was also as- 
sessed and respondents could endorse 
as many professionals and treatment 
options as they had used in the previous 
12 months. 
Care received in the 12 months 
before the survey was categorized into 
the following sectors: (i) any mental 
health specialty provider, including 
psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors, 
psychotherapists, mental health nurses 
and social workers in a mental health 
specialty setting; (ii) general medical 
practitioners, including family physi- 
cians and paediatricians; (iii) human 
services, including outpatient treatment 
with a religious or spiritual adviser or a 
social worker or counsellor in any set- 
ting other than a specialty mental health 
setting; (iv) complementary-alternative 
medicine and internet use, includ- 
ing self-help groups, any other healer, 
such as a herbalist, a chiropractor, or a 
spiritualist and other alternative therapy; 
and (v) school-based programmes that 
consisted of any special schools, special 
classes within a school and school-based 
therapies. 

Available evidence-based treatment 
guidelines for primary care19 and special- 
ty mental health providers 20–24 were used 
to define minimally adequate treatment 
during the previous 12 months as receiv- 
ing: (i) minimally adequate psychothera- 
py, consisting of four or more outpatient 
visits to any provider 25,26; (ii) minimally 
adequate pharmacotherapy, consisting 
of two or more outpatient visits to 
any provider and treatment with any 
medication for any length of time; 27 or 
(iii) reporting still being “in treatment” 
at the time of the interview. Although 
this definition is broader than the one 
that we used previously, 28 it allowed 
us to obtain conservative estimates of 
minimally adequate treatment across 
sectors. In sensitivity analyses, a more 
stringent definition of minimally ad- 
equate treatment was also used in which 
we required: (i) eight or more visits to 
any service sector for psychotherapy, 
or (ii) four or more visits to any service 
sector and 30 or more days taking any 
medication for pharmacotherapy. 
Assessment of sociodemographic 
correlates 
Information was collected on sex, 
age and family grouping, i.e. whether 
participants lived with both parents. 
Participants were considered students 
if currently enrolled. Adolescents were 
asked whether they worked during the 

school year, whether they were ever 
married and whether they had children. 
All three conditions represent an addi- 
tional social burden not typical of most 
adolescents; therefore, participants an- 
swering affirmatively to any of the three 
were categorized as having social bur- 
dens. Adolescents were asked about the 
educational attainment of each of their 
parents. Parental education was then 
categorized as none/primary (≤ 6 years 
of education), secondary (7–9 years of 
education), high school (10–12 years 
of education) or college (≥ 13 years of 
education) and the score of the parent 
with the highest level of education was 
used. Parent-reported family income was 
categorized into low, average and high. 

The data were weighted to adjust for 
differential probabilities of selection 
and non-response. Post-stratification to 
the urban Mexican adolescent popula- 
tion according to the 2000 census in 
the target age and sex range was also 
performed. Standard errors for propor- 
tions were obtained by the Taylor series 
linearization method with SUDAAN 
software (RTI International, Research 
Triangle Park, NC, United States of 
America).29 Logistic regression analysis 30 
was performed to study demographic 
correlates. Two parallel analyses were 
performed, one for receiving any treat- 
ment among those with disorders and 
a second one for receiving minimally 
adequate treatment among those with 
disorders who received any treatment. 
Odds ratios and corresponding stan- 
dard errors from logistic regression 
coefficients were also obtained with 
SUDAAN and 95% confidence in- 
tervals (CIs) were adjusted for design 
effects. Statistical significance was 
evaluated with two-sided design-based 
tests with the 0.05 level of significance. 

Table 1 shows that 9.1% of the ado- 
lescents used any service for emotional 
problems, with a higher use of services 
among those with a disorder (13.7%) 
compared to those with no disorder 
(6.1%). Respondents with a substance- 
use disorder reported the greatest use 
of services, and those with an anxiety 
disorder the lowest. For those with any 
disorder, the health-care sector was the 
most widely used for mental health

services (by 9.5%), with school-based 
treatments being next most frequent. 
Most services delivered by the health- 
care sector were provided by mental 
health specialists, with minimal partici- 
pation of the general medical sector. The 
disorder with the highest level of treat- 
ment was drug abuse with dependence 
(38%, largely treated in the non-health 
care system), followed by conduct 
disorder (25%, largely treated in the 
health-care system; data not shown). 
Among those with a psychiatric 
disorder, 80% used only one type of 
provider, 17% two types of provid- 
ers, and 3% used three or more types 
of providers. Among those that used 
two providers, the most common 
combination was for health care and 
school-based providers. About 72% of 
those used both services simultaneously, 
while 18% used school services first and 
later reported the use of a health-care 
provider. In the health-care sector, the 
mean number of visits was 7.8 for those 
with a psychiatric disorder and 6.2 for 
those without a disorder; for the non- 
health-care sector it was 19.1 and 16.5 
visits respectively, and for school-based 
services it was 14.9 and 16.9 visits, re- 
spectively (results are not shown). 
Table 2 presents the adequacy of 
treatment. Overall, 58.4% of those 
receiving any services obtained any 
treatment that could be considered 
minimally adequate, with anxiety dis- 
orders showing the lowest percentage 
and substance use disorders the high- 
est. Those with a disorder were more 
likely to receive adequate treatment 
than those without a disorder and the 
health-care sector showed the lowest 
level of adequacy. 
In sensitivity analyses using our 
more stringent definition, the propor- 
tion of respondents obtaining mini- 
mally adequate treatment among those 
with disorders receiving any services de- 
creased to 27.2%; this proportion var- 
ied between 22.2% among respondents 
with substance disorders to 36.8% 
among those with affective disorders. 
(The results are not shown but are avail- 
able upon request from G Borges.) 
Table 3 presents sociodemographic 
correlates of receiving any services, as 
well as receiving minimally adequate 
treatment, among respondents with 
12-month prevalence of these disorders. 
Females and those whose parents had 
higher levels of education were more 
likely to use services. Those attending 
school and adolescents without any 
“social burden” had increased, but not 
significantly, odds ratios of receiving 
treatment. The only significant cor- 
relate of receiving adequate treatment 
among those with a psychiatric disorder 
receiving any treatment was those cur- 
rently attending school. 
The greater likelihood of service 
use and adequacy of services for those 
attending school may be related to 
school-based programmes being exclu- 
sively available for this group only. For

this reason, we refitted our models to 
obtain results for health care and non- 
health care services separately. In these 
analyses, respondents attending school 
were no more likely to get health care 
or non-health care services than those 
not attending school. Nevertheless, 
those attending school still had a sig- 
nificantly increased likelihood (odds 
ratio: 11.6; 95% CI: 3.5–38.2) of re- 
ceiving adequate health care compared 
to those not attending school (data not 
shown). 
Discussion 
Main findings 
Less than one in seven adolescents with 
any psychiatric disorder in the last 12 
months used any services. Although 
this is the first time that representative 
service use data are available for adoles- 
cents in Mexico, prior research among 
adults in Mexico also showed that the 
majority of people with a recent psy- 
chiatric disorder did not receive recent 
treatment.3,31,32 Comparable data from 
other developed countries confirms 
the large unmet need that adolescents 
face.8–12 A study of another Latino 
population in Puerto Rico 7 showed 
that only 26% of adolescents affected 
by mental disorders used services. Our 
results reveal the even larger gap that 
adolescents in Mexico face, with only 
14% of those with a disorder using any 
service in the prior 12 months. Data 
for comparison on service use in other 
Latin American countries are lacking, 
although the situation of scarce re- 
sources, as well as few services and 

personnel for treating children having 
a mental disorder, is commonplace in 
the region.33 The lack of resources in 
Mexico City may be similar to other 
less-developed countries, although 
more research is needed before we can 
generalize our findings. Respondents 
without a disorder comprised about 
40% of the population using services, 
raising concern that scarce resources 
for mental health care may be misal- 
located. However, some services may 
be used by respondents with lifetime 
histories of disorders; other respondents 
without apparent disorders may also be 
using services appropriately for primary 
prevention, subthreshold symptoms 
that do not qualify as full-blown dis- 
orders or for disorders not assessed by 
our survey. 
Our results on the percentages re- 
ceiving minimally adequate care (58%) 
as well as a more stringent definition 
(27%) are very low and similar to rates 
reported among adults in Mexico,3 sug- 
gesting that the entire system of care for 
mental disorders is in need of reform. 
The system for child mental health care 
in Latin America has been described as 
excessively focused on serious and rare 
disorders.33 A recent evaluation of psy- 
chiatric care in Mexico 34 concluded that 
it is still mainly provided by large public 
psychiatric hospitals. Even though this 
study did not focus specifically on ado- 
lescents, these conclusions could well 
apply to youth. 
There are many potential reasons 
for failure to receive minimally ad- 
equate care. Individuals with mental 
disorders, especially those with the 
most serious and impairing forms, 
may suffer from considerable stigma- 
tization and discrimination associated 
with their mental disorder 32 and may 
lack the ability and resources to consis- 
tently access mental health treatments.35 
Patients may also find prescribed treat- 
ments intolerable.36 Providers may lack 
the training to recognize and properly 
diagnose mental disorders or lack the 
knowledge concerning optimal treat- 
ment regimens.37–39 These results may 
not be surprising, given the dearth of 
mental health resources in Mexico.40 
It is noteworthy that there is only one 
child psychiatric hospital in the entire 
country, located in Mexico City. 
Two sociodemographic character- 
istics predicted the use of mental health 
services among subjects with psychiat- 
ric disorders, being female and having 
more educated parents. Some studies 
find adolescent males to be more likely 
to receive services than females,41 but 
others have failed to do so.8,10,11,42,43 It is 
not clear why in this Mexican sample, 
females with psychiatric disorders 
were more likely to get services, but it 
is possible that the Mexican culture, 
that emphasizes protection of young 
females more so than males, could 
play a role or that deviant behaviour 
is tolerated more in males than fe- 
males. More educated parents may be 
more likely to recognize symptoms of 
distress and mental disorders in their 
child and be able to seek treatment.44 
It is possible that these adolescents 
have more supportive environments

or more assistance in promoting treat- 
ment adherence. Although Mexico is a 
country with low socioeconomic status 
and the lack of financial resources may 
help explain the low rate of service use, 
we did not find an association between 
income and receiving any treatment 
or minimally adequate treatment – a 
lack of association also reported from 
other studies in developed countries,8 
but not all.42,43 

The Mexican Adolescent Mental Health 
Survey is a household survey with a lim- 
ited response rate (71%), representing 
adolescents living in one of the largest 
metropolitan areas in the world, where 
health services are more available and 
so these results may not be generalized 
to other urban or rural areas of Mexico. 
Furthermore, we did not interview 
institutionalized or homeless adoles- 
cents, we only assessed a limited subset 
of DSM-IV disorders, and those more 
affected by mental illness may be more 
likely to have been non-respondents. 
Although the WMH-CIDI-A was 
adapted from the adult version used 
in the Mexico National Comorbid- 
ity Survey and validated in another 
Spanish-speaking country,18 the reli- 
ability and validity of the adolescent 
version used in this survey has not yet 
been established in Mexico. This set 
of limitations may have caused us to 
underestimate the unmet needs for 
mental health treatment and minimally 
adequate treatment. 
In addition, we used a definition of 
minimally adequate treatment created 
for the adult population.5,13 Although 
some investigators 45–50 have shown that 
treatments conforming to recommen- 
dations in evidence-based guidelines 
improve clinical outcomes, we are not 
aware of studies that validated our 
exact definition of minimally adequate 
treatment for this population. 
Finally, we only examined rela- 
tionships between a small number of 
patient or family factors 44 and service 
utilization, type and adequacy; we did 
not have the ability to investigate other 
potentially important variables, such as 
the characteristics of service providers. 
All variables assessed were subject to 
misclassification which, especially if dif- 
ferential, could have introduced bias.

Finally, we cannot conclude that factors

related causally because of the study’s 
cross-sectional nature. 

Improvement in the mental health 
care of Mexican youth is urgently 
needed and should not depend only 
on additional services and resources. 
Our results shed light on an enor- 
mous public health problem facing 
Mexico. The large majority of those 
with needs received no treatment from 
any sector. The negative public health 
consequences of such unmet needs for 
treatment in adolescents are likely to be 
large. In this context, the development 
of additional mental health resources 
is sorely needed and an essential first 
step. However, reallocation of services 
and providers will be needed to take ad- 
vantage of the resources that are made 
available. Active outreach, school- 
based programmes employing brief 
screens may be needed for the accurate 
identification of children with mental 
disorders. Interventions to train non- 
health care professionals to recognize 
children with mental health conditions 
and make referrals for health care may 
also be useful. Finally, even among 
Mexican youth with mental disorders 
from families with financial means, 
addressing out-of-pocket costs and 
other economic barriers may also be

treatment among those

Traitement des troubles mentaux chez les adolescentes de Mexico 
Objectif La présente étude décrit la prévalence, l’adéquation aux 
besoins et les corrélats du recours aux services de santé mentale 
sur 12 mois chez les sujets de l’Enquête sur la santé mentale des 
adolescents de Mexico. 
Méthodes Les auteurs ont mené une enquête en face-à-face dans les 
ménages sur un échantillon probabiliste de 3005 adolescents de 12 à 
17 ans, résidant dans la zone métropolitaine de Mexico en 2005. Ils ont 
évalué la prévalence des troubles mentaux et le recours aux services de 
santé mentale à l’aide de la version Adolescents et assistée par ordinateur 
du World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. 
Des corrélations entre le recours aux services de santé mentale et 
l’adéquation du traitement ont été identifiées à l’aide d’analyses par 
régression logistique prenant en compte le mode de constitution de 
l’échantillon complexe et les processus de pondération. 
Résultats Parmi les adolescents interrogés souffrant de troubles 
psychiatriques, moins d’un sur sept avaient fait appel aux services 
de santé mentale au cours de l’année précédente. Ce sont les 
adolescents interrogés présentant des troubles toxicomaniaques 
qui ont mentionné la plus forte prévalence du recours à ces 
services et dont les troubles anxieux étaient les plus faibles. Parmi 
les adolescents interrogés ayant bénéficié de services de santé 
mentale, environ un sur deux avait reçu un traitement pouvant 
être considéré comme très peu adapté. 
Conclusion Nous avons relevé d’importants besoins non satisfaits 
en matière de santé mentale chez les adolescents de Mexico 
souffrant de troubles psychiatriques. Il est urgent d’améliorer les 
soins de santé mentale dispensés aux jeunes de cette ville. 

Tratamiento de los adolescentes con trastornos mentales en México D.F. 
Objetivo Se describen aquí la prevalencia, la idoneidad y los 
factores correlacionados del uso de servicios de salud mental a lo 
largo de 12 meses entre los participantes en la Encuesta de Salud 
Mental de Adolescentes de México. 
Métodos Los autores llevaron a cabo encuestas de hogares personales 
con una muestra probabilística de 3005 adolescentes de 12 a 17 años 
residentes en el área metropolitana de México D.F. durante 2005. La 
prevalencia de trastornos de salud mental y el uso de los servicios 
correspondientes se evaluaron con la versión computadorizada para 
adolescentes de la Entrevista CIDI (Composite International Diagnostic 
Interview) sobre Salud Mental Mundial. Los factores correlacionados 
con la utilización de los servicios y el tratamiento adecuado se 
determinaron mediante análisis de regresión logística adaptados al 
complejo proceso de diseño y ponderación de muestras. 
mexicanos. 
Resultados Menos de uno de cada siete encuestados con 
trastornos psiquiátricos habían usado algún tipo de servicio de 
salud mental durante el año precedente. Los encuestados con 
trastornos de consumo de sustancias son los que declararon la 
máxima prevalencia de uso de servicios, y la prevalencia más baja 
correspondió a los afectados por trastornos de ansiedad. Entre 
quienes usaron algún tipo de servicio, alrededor de uno de cada dos 
encuestados recibieron un tratamiento mínimamente adecuado. 
Conclusión Se han detectado importantes necesidades no 
atendidas de servicios de salud mental entre los adolescentes 
con trastornos psiquiátricos de México D.F. Es preciso mejorar 
urgentemente la atención de salud mental de los jóvenes
