            "criteria": "A search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases was conducted through March 2009 using the search terms life stress, life event, depression, depress, serotonin transporter, 5-HTTLPR, interaction, and moderation. Bibliographies of studies were also reviewed. A total of 26 articles published or set for publication were identified through this search strategy (Figure 1). Inclusion criteria for studies for the meta-analyses were published articles that included data on the association between the (1) 5-HTTLPR genotype (S, SL, or LL), (2) number of stressful life events (0, 1, 2, or \u22653) or equivalent, and (3) categorical measure of depression defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) or ability to use a cut point to define depression from standardized rating scales. To maximize our ability to use a common framework for variable definition, we also requested original data from all studies that appeared to meet inclusion criteria published prior to 2008.10,15-28 We received original data in a usable format for the meta-analysis from 10 of the 14 study investigators. A total of 14 studies were included in the analysis, 15-20,23,25-27,29-32 10 of which15-20,23,25-27,29,30 were also included in a second sex-specific meta-analysis of original data. Nine other studies did not meet inclusion criteria.33-41",
