Previous research examining gene–environment interaction (GrE) with regard to vulnerability to 
depression and anxiety has yielded conﬂicting results. The present study was designed to further inves- 
tigate GrE between 5-HTTLPR and exposure to environmental adversity, using diﬀerent phenotypic and 
genotypic characterizations as well as diﬀerent types of adversity within a prospective study design. Data 
were available from an ongoing epidemiological cohort study following the outcome of early risk factors 
from birth to adulthood. At age 19 yr, 309 participants (142 males, 167 females) were characterized 
on measures of depression and anxiety through interview and questionnaire (DSM-IV diagnosis, 
Beck Depression Inventory, Harm Avoidance). Environmental adversity was assessed at birth (family 
adversity), and at age 19 yr (stressful life events). Bi- and tri-allelic 5-HTTLPR genotypes were obtained 
from genomic DNA. Results indicated that depression and anxiety in 19-yr-olds were strongly associated 
with both family adversity and stressful life events. Individuals with the LL genotype of 5-HTTLPR who 
were exposed to high family adversity displayed signiﬁcantly higher rates of depressive or anxiety 
disorders and had more depressive symptoms than those without either condition. This GrE replicates 
recent ﬁndings from an epidemiological cohort study of adolescents but is in contrast to many previous 
reports suggesting an interaction with the S allele. No evidence for GrE was obtained with regard to 
current stressful life events and trait anxiety. One possible source for the conﬂicting ﬁndings might be 
attributed to heterogeneity in depression phenotypes and environmental adversity.

disorders are associated with signiﬁcant morbidity 
and increased mortality and co-occurrence of other 
clinical syndromes (such as substance use disorder) 
is common. The social and economic consequences 
of these conditions are huge ; major depression is cur- 
rently the leading cause of disability in individuals 
aged 15–44 yr, and it is estimated that it will rank ﬁrst 
in the global burden of disease by 2030 (Mathers & 
Loncar, 2006). The comorbidity of these disorders is 
high, with prospective studies indicating that anxiety 

disorders often precede the onset of depression and 
identify individuals at risk for developing depression 
(Beesdo et al. 2007). Despite intense research eﬀorts, 
progress in understanding the aetiology of these dis- 
orders is limited. Genetic epidemiological studies 
reported moderate heritability, with an estimated 
genetic contribution of y40–50 % for depression and 
30–40 % for anxiety disorders, although the speci- 
ﬁc genes that confer risk are largely unidentiﬁed 
(Hettema et al. 2001 ; McGuﬃn et al. 2003). 
Of the brain systems suggested to be involved in the 
aetiology of these disorders, much attention has been 
placed on serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission. A 
critical role in the regulation of serotonin function in 
the brain pertains to the serotonin transporter (5-HTT), 
making the gene encoding this protein a prominent 
candidate for genetic association studies. This locus 
contains a well-studied bi-allelic polymorphism in the 
promoter region (5-HTTLPR) consisting of two com- 
mon alleles, which appear to result in diﬀerential 
5-HTT expression and function (Heils et al. 1996 ; Lesch 
et al. 1996). Compared with the ‘long’ (L) variant, the 
‘short ’ (S) allele was found to exhibit signiﬁcantly 
lower transcriptional activity of the 5-HTT gene in 
vitro. Recently, a third functional allele has been de- 
scribed, resulting from an A>G substitution in the 
L allele, which was reported to be equivalent in ex- 
pression to the S allele (Nakamura et al. 2000). Failure 
to distinguish between these alleles may be one reason 
for the inconsistency in previous studies investigating 
the eﬀects of 5-HTTLPR. 
Since the ﬁrst reports by Lesch et al. (1996), num- 
erous studies have examined a potential role of 5- 
HTTLPR in determining a variety of personality traits 
and psychiatric disorders, including depression and 
anxiety. However, a consistent picture of the contri- 
bution of this polymorphism has not yet emerged. 
In a meta-analysis surveying 17 independent samples, 
evidence for a signiﬁcant, albeit weak association of 
5-HTTLPR with bipolar depression was found, in- 
dicating that the S allele increased the risk (OR 1.13, 
95 % CI 1.05–1.22). While no association with unipolar 
depression was detected in this meta-analysis which 
was comprised of samples of small sizes (Lasky-Su et 
al. 2005), a subsequent analysis conducted in a large 
and homogeneous sample did ﬁnd association (OR 
1.26, 95 % CI 1.07–1.48) (Hoefgen et al. 2005). A meta- 
analysis of the association between 5-HTTLPR and 
trait anxiety based on 26 studies failed to provide 
support for a relationship between anxiety and the 
presence of the S allele (Schinka et al. 2004). Recently, 
in a meta-analysis of 51 studies, the negative ﬁndings 
of previous surveys was conﬁrmed with regard to two 
measures of trait anxiety [Harm Avoidance (HA) and 
EPQ Neuroticism], suggesting, however, a possible 
association with NEO Neuroticism (Munafo et al. 
2008c). 
Epidemiological studies have amply demonstrated 
that stress constitutes a major risk factor for the de- 
velopment and persistence of depression and anxiety. 
However, little is known as to why certain individuals 
exposed to speciﬁc environmental pathogens actually 
develop a disorder while others remain unaﬀected. 
Only very recently have researchers started to inves- 
tigate the importance of interactions between genetic 
and environmental factors (GrE) in the development 
of these disorders. In a seminal study, Caspi et al. 
(2003) reported an interaction between 5-HTTLPR and 
depression, demonstrating that the S allele was as- 
sociated with depression only in individuals exposed 
to stressful 
life events (SLE). These ﬁndings have 
attracted a large number of replication attempts, the 
majority of which provided results largely consistent 
with the initial reports (Uher & McGuﬃn, 2008). While 
a similar relationship was conﬁrmed for alcohol use, 
no evidence was found for GrE in anxiety. 
Although the majority of previous positive GrE 
ﬁndings showed that individuals exposed to stress 
had an increased risk of depression only when carry- 
ing the S allele of 5-HTTLPR, a few studies revealed 
the opposite eﬀect suggesting an interaction with the 
L allele (Eley et al. 2004 ; Gillespie et al. 2005 ; Surtees 
et al. 2006). In a recent publication reporting the results 
from two large Australian community surveys of ado- 
lescents and young adults, Chipman et al. (2007) failed 
to replicate a signiﬁcant GrE between 5-HTTLPR and 
recent SLE or childhood adversity on symptoms of 
depression. However, using data from the Australian 
(ATP), a longitudinal study 
Temperament Project 
following child development since early infancy, 
Chipman et al. found evidence that adolescents aged 
17–18 yr with the LL genotype of 5-HTTLPR who had 
experienced persistently high levels of family ad- 
versity were at a greater risk of depression than those 
without either condition. Based on these ﬁndings, the 
authors proposed that the duration of exposure to 
stress might be a critical condition which may account 
for the conﬂicting results. 
A similar ﬁnding was reported by Olsson et al. 
(2005) with regard to anxiety in adolescents, indicating 
an increase of persistent ruminative anxiety in risk 
settings with each additional copy of the L allele. 
Recently, a study by Sjoberg et al. (2006) in an ado- 
lescent sample suggested that the interaction between 
5-HTTLPR and environmental stress factors on de- 
pression might be sex-speciﬁc. While females with the 
SS genotype displayed a signiﬁcant increase in de- 
pressive symptoms when exposed to psychosocial 
adversity, the opposite eﬀect was found in males, with 
higher scores only in those who were carriers of the LL 
genotype and had experienced adversity. Considering 
the current evidence, in a most recent meta-analysis 
(Munafo et al. 2008 b) concluded that the eﬀects of 
5-HTTLPR and its interaction with SLE on risk of de- 
pression were negligible and positive results were 
compatible with chance ﬁndings. 
Given the discrepant evidence regarding the mod- 
erating eﬀect of 5-HTTLPR on vulnerability to adverse 
environments, the present study aims to further in- 
vestigate GrE between 5-HTTLPR and exposure to 
environmental adversity on depression and anxiety 
in a high-risk community sample of young adults. 
Particular attention is given to variation in genotypic 
and phenotypic characteristics as well as to the dur- 
ation of stressors, considering both persistent family 
adversity and current SLE as potential environmental 
pathogens. 


This investigation was conducted as part of 
the 
Mannheim Study of Children at Risk, an ongoing epi- 
demiological cohort study following the outcome of 
early risk factors from infancy into adulthood (Laucht 
et al. 2000). The initial sample comprised 384 chil- 
dren born between 1986 and 1988, of predominantly 
(>99.0 %) European descent. Infants were recruited 
from two obstetric and six children’s hospitals of the 
Rhine-Neckar region of Germany and were included 
consecutively into the sample according to a two- 
factorial design intended to enrich and control the 
status of the sample regarding obstetric and psycho- 
social risks (for more details, see Laucht et al. 1997). 
Only ﬁrst-born children with singleton births and 
German-speaking parents were enrolled in the study. 
Furthermore, children with severe physical handicaps, 
obvious genetic defects, or metabolic diseases were 
excluded. Assessments were conducted at regular in- 
tervals throughout development, most recently at 
age 19 yr. Of the initial sample of 384 participants, 18 
(4.7 %) were excluded because of severe handicaps 
(IQ or MQ<70 or neurological disorder), 39 (10.2 %) 
were dropouts or had incomplete data, and 18 (4.7 %) 
refused to participate in blood sampling. The ﬁnal 
sample on which complete data were available con- 
sisted of 309 young adults (142 males, 167 females). 
Loss of subjects was not selective with regard to sex 


and obstetric or psychosocial risks. The study was 
approved by the ethics committee of the University of 
Heidelberg and written informed consent was ob- 
tained from all participants. 

To obtain psychiatric diagnoses for the period be- 
tween ages 15 yr and 19 yr, i.e. between prior and 
current assessment, the Structured Clinical Interview 
for DSM-IV (SCID ; APA, 1994 ; German version by 
Wittchen et al. 1997) was administered to the 19-yr- 
olds. The SCID is a widely used diagnostic interview, 
for which a considerable body of reliability and 
validity data has been published. Twenty-four (7.8 %) 
of the young adults met criteria for any depressive 
disorder, and 19 (6.8 %) met criteria for any anxiety 
disorder. Due to the low number of clinical diagnoses 
in this epidemiological study, a broad phenotype was 
utilized for the present evaluation, deﬁned as diag- 
nosis of any anxiety or depressive disorder (n=39, 
12.6 %). In addition, symptoms of depression and 
trait anxiety at age 19 yr were assessed by the 
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI ; Beck & Steer, 1987 ; 
German version by Hautzinger et al. 1994) and the 
Harm Avoidance subscale of the Temperament and 
Character Inventory (TCI ; Cloninger et al. 1994 ; Ger- 
man version by Richter et al. 2000), respectively. Both 
self-report instruments have been used extensively in 
clinical and epidemiological research and have excel- 
lent psychometric properties. 
Measurement of family adversity according to an 
‘enriched ’ index as proposed by Rutter & Quinton 
(1977) was derived from a standardized parent in- 
terview conducted at the 3-month assessment. The 
index assesses the presence or absence of 11 adverse 
family factors (Table 1), covering characteristics of the 
parents, the partnership, and the family environment 
during a period of 1 yr prior to birth (mean=1.93, 
S.D.=2.06, range 0–7). Assessment of stability over a 
period of >10 yr revealed coeﬃcients of about r=0.70. 
Current SLE were assessed using a modiﬁed and 
shortened version of the Munich Events List (MEL ; 
Maier-Diewald et al. 1983). The 53-item questionnaire 
asked about occurrence and threat of severe life events 
and chronic diﬃculties in the period between the 15-yr 
and 19-yr assessments. The items addressed all areas 
of young adults’ lives from school and job to partner, 
family, parents, living conditions, legal troubles, and 
health problems. Several indices can be derived from 
the MEL. For the current analysis, a total life event 
score was computed which counted the number of 
the past 4 yr (mean=7.74, 
life events throughout

the psychometric characteristics of the MEL (Wittchen 
et al. 1989). 

Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood or 
saliva with the Qiamp (Qiagen, USA) kit. The bi-allelic 
LS polymorphism was ampliﬁed by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), as previously described (Heils et al. 
1996). The 484-bp fragment was designed as S and 
the 528-bp fragment as L, respectively. The functional 
rs25531 variant which is located on this locus deﬁnes a 
tri-allelic polymorphism. This is comprised of the LA, 
LG, and SA alleles (the SG allele is extremely rare). 
The LG and S alleles have comparable levels of 5-HTT 
expression which are lower than that of the LA allele. 
The 5-HTTLPR locus was ampliﬁed by PCR as out- 
lined by Wendland et al. (2006), without multiplexing. 
In a total volume of 20 ml, y25 ng genomic DNA was 
ampliﬁed in the presence of 1rPromega PCR Master 
Mix (www.promega.com) with oligonucleotide pri- 
mers ‘5-HTTLPR and rs25531 forw. ’/‘5-HTTLPR and 
rs25531 rev. ’ PCR conditions were : 5 min at 95 xC, 
followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 xC, 90 s at 70 xC, 60 s 
at 72 xC, and a ﬁnal extension of 10 min at 72 xC. 
Restriction was performed with 10 U HpaII for 4 h, 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (www. 
neb.com). Genotypes were scored according to the tri- 
allelic polymorphism LA, LG, and S alleles. To check 
5-HTTLPR ampliﬁcations for dropout of the L allele, 
the genotypes produced by two diﬀerent sets of 
primers and ampliﬁcation conditions were compared. 
Comparison between the protocols of Heils et al. (1996) 
and Wendland et al. (2006) yielded an error rate <0.01 
in 95 % of the total sample genotyped in comparison. 

t tests or analyses of variance and x2 tests, respectively, 
were performed to test diﬀerences in scores and fre- 
quencies between sex and genotype groups. Linear 
and logistic regression analyses were conducted, as 
appropriate, to examine whether 5-HTTLPR geno- 
types moderated the eﬀect of environmental adversity 
on continuous and categorical outcome measures. For 
each analysis, sex was controlled for in the ﬁrst step, 
the main eﬀects of genotype and adversity were en- 
tered in the second step, followed by their interaction 
in the third step. To assess potential sex-speciﬁc GrE 
eﬀects, a three-way interaction with sex was entered in 
the ﬁnal step. Family adversity and current SLE were 
examined in separate models. Results are reported for 
the traditional LS classiﬁcation and, additionally, for 
a re-classiﬁcation, based on the tri-allelic genotypes. 
Therefore, the tri-allelic genotypes were transformed 
into a bi-allelic model according to their level of ex- 
pression as follows : LGS, LGLG, and SS were desig- 
nated as S’S’, LAS and LALG as L’S’, and LALA as L’L’. 
The distribution of genotypes (LL, 34.0 % ; LS, 50.8 % ; 
SS, 15.2 % ; and L’L’, 25.6 % ; L’S’, 55.7 % ; S’S’, 18.8 %) 
did not deviate from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.

There was a signiﬁcant eﬀect of sex on measures of 
depression and anxiety, indicating higher BDI (p< 
0.001) and HA scores (p<0.002) as well as higher rates 
of DSM-IV diagnoses related to anxiety or depression 
(p<0.002) in females than in males. Genotype groups 
did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly with regard to sex, age, IQ, 
family adversity, or number of SLE (data not shown). 
Table 2 summarizes the ﬁndings of linear regression 
models testing the eﬀect of 5-HTTLPR genotypes and 
environmental adversity on measures of depression 
and anxiety in young adults. When family adversity 
was examined, a signiﬁcant interaction was observed 
for diagnosis of depression or anxiety with regard to 
both the 5-HTTLPR LS and L’S’ polymorphisms, such 
that higher adversity was associated with increased 
rates of disorder in LL and L’L’ homozygotes, re- 
spectively (LL : OR 1.64, 95 % CI 1.21–2.22 ; L’L’ : OR 
1.64, 95 % CI 1.16–2.33) but not in S allele carriers (LL : 
OR 1.16, 95 % CI 0.96–1.40 ; L’L’ : OR 1.20, 95 % CI 
0.99–1.44). Similar results were obtained for the BDI 
score and the 5-HTTLPR LS polymorphism but not the 
L’S’ polymorphism. Figure 1 illustrates the interaction, 
indicating that, when exposed to high adversity, LL 

median split on the family adversity index. No sig- 
niﬁcant GrE emerged between 5-HTTLPR genotypes 
and family adversity on the HA score. Furthermore, 
there was a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of family adversity 
on all outcome measures, with higher scores and 
rates of depression or anxiety associated with in- 
creasing adversity, while no signiﬁcant main eﬀect of 
5-HTTLPR genotypes and no three-way interaction 
with sex were found (data not shown). 
With regard to current SLE, Table 2 conﬁrms 
the presence of a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of SLE on all 
outcome measures, indicating rising scores or rates 
of depression and anxiety when the number of life 
events increased, and the absence of any GrE with 
5-HTTLPR genotypes. 

The present study aimed at further investigating GrE 
between 5-HTTLPR and exposure to environmental 
adversity, using diﬀerent phenotypic and genotypic 
characterizations as well as diﬀerent types of ad- 
versity. Based on data from a 19-yr longitudinal study 
of a high-risk community sample, our results demon- 
strate that 5-HTTLPR and adverse psychosocial con- 
ditions interact 
to predict patterns of mood and 
anxiety psychopathology in young adults. Speciﬁcally, 
we found that individuals homozygous for the L allele 
of 5-HTTLPR displayed higher rates of depressive 
or anxiety disorders and reported more depressive 
symptoms when exposed to adversity, while no such 
relationship emerged in individuals carrying the S 
allele. This GrE was demonstrated for (i) exposure 
to family adversity, but not to current SLE, and (ii) 
depressive symptoms, but not trait anxiety. 
The results outlined above are at variance with 
those from numerous previous studies indicating 5- 
HTTLPR by adversity interaction in which higher 
rates of depression were observed in carriers of the S 
allele who experienced SLE (Uher & McGuﬃn, 2008). 
However, they are, in agreement with a recent report 
from the ATP study (Chipman et al. 2007) which 
demonstrated that adolescents homozygous for the L 
allele were at greater risk of depression when exposed 
to persistently high levels of family adversity, while no 
evidence for GrE was obtained in individuals ex- 
posed to recent SLE or recent 
family adversity. 
The present study can be considered as a direct repli- 
cation of the ATP ﬁndings, as it shares a number of 
important features with that study. Both the ATP and 
our study (i) rely on data collected within an epide- 
miological cohort design following children during 
(ii) use similar 
their development, 
the course of 
measures of psychosocial adversity (in particular, of 
family adversity) and diﬀerentiate between diﬀerent 
types of adversity, i.e. between current (episodic) life 
stress vs. persistent family adversity, and (iii) examine 
GrE with regard to depression in young age cohorts 
at the transition from adolescence to adulthood. 
The current ﬁndings parallel recent evidence of a 
moderating eﬀect of 5-HTTLPR on the relationship 
between SLE and alcohol use, revealing a similar in- 
consistency. While Covault et al. (2007) and Kaufman 
et al. (2007) found evidence for earlier and heavier 
alcohol use only in carriers of the S allele following 
SLE, Olsson et al. (2005) reported an increase in binge 
drinking with each additional copy of the L allele in 
individuals exposed to childhood adversity. The latter 
observation corresponds to a number of more recent 
reports indicating that carriers of the LL genotype 
exhibit higher drinking activity (Bleich et al. 2007 ; 
Hinckers et al. 2006 ; Hu et al. 2006 ; Kweon et al. 2005). 
Given the high comorbidity of depression with alcohol 
dependence, and of adolescent behaviour disorders 
with depression and alcohol abuse, a moderating ef- 
fect of 5-HTTLPR on the relationship of these disorders 
with stress seems plausible. 
A number of reasons may explain why some studies 
oﬀer support for a potential 5-HTTLPRradversity 
interaction implicating the S allele as a risk allele, 
while others found the opposite eﬀect. One aspect that 
has been largely overlooked in previous research is 
the importance of a developmental perspective. The 
majority of studies conducted so far have neglected 
issues, using subjects whose ages 
developmental 
spanned a wide range. Given the dynamics of genetic 
inﬂuences across the lifespan, the impact of genetic 
factors is likely to depend on developmental stages 
(Reiss & Neiderhiser, 2000). Research ﬁndings ob- 
served across the life cycle suggest that adolescent- 
and adult-onset depressive and anxiety disorders may 
represent diﬀerent subtypes. For example, most adults 
with depression were found not to have been de- 
pressed as adolescents (Klein et al. 1999). Moreover, 
depressed adolescents were reported to diﬀer from 
depressed adults with regard to various neurobiolog- 
ical correlates and treatment response, such as basal 
cortisol secretion, response to serotonergic probes, and 
eﬃcacy of tricyclic medication (Kaufman et al. 2001). 
Furthermore, compared to individuals with adult on- 
set, those with adolescent onset were more likely 
to have experienced unique childhood risks, such as 
neurodevelopmental problems, psychopathology and 
instability in their family of origin, and behavioural 
problems, in particular of the externalizing spectrum, 
such as antisocial and hyperactive behaviour ( Jaﬀee 
et al. 2002). Another feature speciﬁc to adolescent onset 
is the high comorbidity with other psychiatric dis- 
orders, particularly with conduct disorder (Angold 
et al. 1999). Following this line of evidence, it could be 
hypothesized that depression and anxiety in young 
adulthood may represent a heterogeneous phenotype, 
which should be diﬀerentiated into developmentally 
speciﬁc subtypes, with the adolescent-onset subtype 
being characterized by a particularly high psycho- 
social load and more externalizing disorders. 
Consistent with this hypothesis, our ﬁndings re- 
vealed a strong main eﬀect of family adversity on 
measures of depression and anxiety. Furthermore, ac- 
cording to additional analyses of our data, individuals 
with depressive or anxiety disorders scored signiﬁ- 
cantly higher on externalizing problems [aggressive 
behaviour and delinquent behaviour according to 
the Young Adult Self Report (YASR ; Achenbach, 
1991)] and were more likely to have a history of 
externalizing disorders, such as conduct disorder, op- 
positional-deﬁant disorder or attention deﬁcit hyper- 
activity disorder (ADHD). Isolating a phenotype of 
adolescent-onset depression characterized by high 
comorbidity with externalizing disorders is of par- 
ticular importance, as several studies have provided 
evidence for an association of conduct problems, ag- 
gressive behaviour and ADHD in childhood with the 
LL genotype of 5-HTTLPR both alone or in interaction 
with environmental adversity (Cadoret et al. 2003 ; 
Kent et al. 2002 ; Nobile et al. 2007 ; Seeger et al. 2001 ; 
Twitchell et al. 2001). 
Further support for diﬀerentiating developmen- 
tally speciﬁc subtypes of depression and anxiety is 
provided by two recent studies investigating the as- 
sociation with 5-HTTLPR in younger samples. In ac- 
cordance with the ﬁndings of the present study, in a 
sample of 247 young adult twins, Chorbov et al. (2007) 
found a signiﬁcant interaction between the number of 
LA alleles and exposure to traumatic life events with 
regard to adolescent onset major depression. In a fMRI 
study assessing amygdala function, Lau et al. (2008) 
demonstrated that adolescents with current anxiety 
or major depressive disorder who were carriers of 
the high-functioning LALA genotype of 5-HTTLPR ex- 
hibited higher amygdala activation to fearful faces 
than patients with the low-functioning S or LG alleles. 
This ﬁnding is at odds with those reported from af- 
fected adults, indicating greater amygdala response in 
S allele carriers (Munafo et al. 2008a). 
Another possible factor contributing to inconsist- 
ency may be heterogeneity in measures and charac- 
teristics of environmental adversity investigated in the 
diﬀerent studies. Several aspects deserve discussion in 


this context, one of which is the timing and duration of 
exposure to adversity. Both animal and human studies 
have underscored the predisposing eﬀect of exposure 
to stress during early childhood for the development 
of later mood and anxiety disorders (Heim et al. 2004). 
Epidemiological studies have provided ample evi- 
dence that exposure to recent SLE is likely to precede 
the onset of episodes of mood and anxiety disorders 
(Kendler et al. 1999). Both early and recent adversity 
have been studied in previous GrE research in hu- 
mans, with the majority of studies having examined 
5-HTTLPR as a moderator of the impact of SLE. Far 
fewer studies have focused on early childhood ad- 
versity as an environmental pathogen. Interestingly, 
several studies reporting association or interaction 
with the LL genotype such as those outlined above 
used indices of family adversity as measures of early 
adversity. However, caution must be exercised in the 
interpretation of such composite measures, as it is 
diﬃcult to separate diﬀerent aspects of exposure to 
adversity. In particular, several family adversity fac- 
tors, such as low educational level or psychiatric dis- 
order of a parent are proxies for persistent adverse 
conditions, as reﬂected by the high stability found 
for this index. Thus, measures of family adversity may 
well confound early exposure to adversity with the 
duration of exposure, a characteristic found to be 
salient in the ATP study. Research on individual dif- 
ferences in biological reactivity to environmental 
stress has highlighted the duration of a stressor as an 
important determinant of the phenomenon of ‘hypo- 
cortisolism ’, characterized by a suppression of the 
activity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) 
axis under conditions of stress (Fries et al. 2005). This 
paradoxical down-regulation of the HPA axis which 
has been noted in both animal and human research is 
suggested to occur after a prolonged period of hyper- 
activity of the HPA axis due to chronic stress. Whether 
the diﬀerentiation between acute and chronic stress 
may contribute to explaining the controversial ﬁnd- 
ings regarding the association between 5-HTTLPR, 
stress and depression, remains an interesting question 
to be addressed in future research. 
Sex is another variable to be taken into consider- 
ation in light of the conﬂicting ﬁndings. Given the 
marked diﬀerences in the extent to which adult males 
and females develop anxiety and mood disorders, one 
possible hypothesis could be that sex-speciﬁc GrE 
may contribute to this pattern. Support for this hy- 
pothesis comes from research indicating diﬀerences in 
HPA axis reactivity in males and females which may 
be directly responsible for higher stress vulnerability in 
women (Kirschbaum et al. 1999). Accordingly, women 

are more likely than men to develop depression 
following SLE (Cyranowski et al. 2000), particularly 
with low stress exposure (Kendler et al. 2004). First 
evidence for a moderating role of sex in GrE ﬁndings 
was reported by a study in non-human primates, 
suggesting that female animals carrying the S allele in 
particular exhibited increased stress reactivity follow- 
ing early stress exposure (Barr et al. 2004). Consistent 
with this ﬁnding, two human studies in adolescents 
found an interaction with the S allele in females only 
and an opposite eﬀect, i.e. higher rates of depression in 
carriers of the LL genotype, in males (Eley et al. 2004 ; 
Sjoberg et al. 2006). However, in the present study no 
signiﬁcant sex diﬀerences with regard to 5-HTTLPR 
GrE on depression were observed, thus failing to 
provide further support for this hypothesis. 
Furthermore, two methodological issues should be 
considered when interpreting the discrepant ﬁndings. 
Recently, an A>G single nucleotide polymorphism 
within the L allele of 5-HTTLPR has been described as 
a potential modulator of 5-HTT function (Hu et al. 
2006), where the LG allele was associated with reduced 
5-HTT expression making it functionally similar to the 
S allele. Unrecognized LG alleles have been suggested 
as one reason for inconsistency in previous studies. As 
our GrE ﬁndings were, at least in part, dependent on 
how the L allele was classiﬁed, this explanation cannot 
be ruled out. However, another possible reason for 
the discrepant results can be excluded by the present 
study. 5-HTTLPR is known to be extremely diﬃcult to 
genotype (Kaiser et al. 2002) ; in a recent study, Yonan 
et al. (2006) demonstrated that levels of magnesium 
concentrations in the PCR reported in previous 
studies caused allele-dependent non-random geno- 
typing errors, resulting in clearly diﬀerent association 
ﬁndings. In our study, typing of the bi-allelic genotype 
of 5-HTTLPR was replicated almost completely using 
two diﬀerent methods yielding a high degree of 
agreement. 
Finally, the present ﬁndings have to be viewed in the 
light of a number of diﬃculties inherent in detecting 
‘true ’ gene–environment interactions. Major issues of 
criticism relate to the multiple testing, low statistical 
power, and the lack of criteria for replication. Multiple 
testing has long been a serious problem in geneti- 
cal research. The availability of datasets which aﬀord 
large numbers of subdivisions (due to diﬀerent ways 
of deﬁning genotype and environmental character- 
istics) multiplies the potential of multiple testing by 
oﬀering numerous additional possibilities for data 
mining (Flint & Munafo, 2008). Another diﬃculty in 
genetic association research is that most studies are 
underpowered. Since statistical tests for examining 
interaction are less powerful than tests of main eﬀects, 
this problem applies particularly to studies of GrE. 
The power to detect an interaction depends on a 
number of conditions, including the distribution of 
genotypes and environmental exposures in the sample 
and the sample size. The relationship between these 
conditions is complex, providing another source of 
heterogeneity between results in the literature attri- 
butable to methodological reasons. Given the probable 
small eﬀects of any single GrE and the associated risk 
of false-positive results, this implies a critical need for 
replication. However, diﬀerences in the measurement 
instruments in assessing genotype, phenotype and 
environmental variables between studies may pro- 
duce further heterogeneity. As long as rigorous cri- 
teria for replication studies are lacking, the GrE 
literature is at risk of being ﬂooded with false-positive 
results, which are broadly described as ‘replications ’ 
when, in fact, they are not. 
Several additional limitations to our study should 
be noted. First, the sample size of the present investi- 
gation is relatively small for a genetic association 
study examining GrE. Since association studies are 
prone to false-positive results, the results reported 
here require further validation in independent sam- 
ples of adequate size. However, as the present study 
can be considered a close replication of the study by 
Chipman et al. (2007), this limitation may be mitigated. 
Second, it is noteworthy that exposure to environ- 
mental adversity, such as family adversity or SLE may 
be under genetic control. Thus, the GrE observed in 
this study might well be due to interactions between 
5-HTTLPR and other genes that were not identiﬁed 
(Plomin et al. 1994). However, as there were no 
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between genotypes regarding 
environmental adversity, this is unlikely to be a con- 
founder in the present study. A third limitation in- 
volves the eﬀects of population stratiﬁcation, such that 
true associations may be hidden by the population 
substructure. However, the potential impact of this 
eﬀect is likely to be minimal here, because all pro- 
bands were selected from an epidemiological cohort 
sample of a well-deﬁned region, where 5-HTTLPR 
allele frequencies in diﬀerent phenotypes were largely 
unbiased by geographical variation in proband char- 
acteristics. Another point of criticism may refer to 
population-speciﬁc variation in linkage disequilib- 
rium (LD). However, in view of the robust evidence of 
a physiological impact of 5-HTTLPR detected in vivo 
(Munafo et al. 2008a) which strongly supports a func- 
tional role of this variant, it is implausible to assume 
that variation in LD may account for the reported dif- 
ferences. 
To summarize, the present study provides fur- 
ther evidence for GrE in the association of 5-HTTLPR 
with depression and anxiety in young adults. The 
ﬁnding that individuals with the LL genotype dis- 
played more psychopathology when exposed to 
family adversity conﬁrms recent reports but is in the 
opposite direction to those of various previous studies, 
which demonstrated elevated rates of depression in 
carriers of the S allele. Potential explanations for 
the conﬂicting ﬁndings pertain to the need for a 
developmentally speciﬁc phenotype deﬁnition and 
to diﬀerences in characterizing environmental ad- 
versity.
