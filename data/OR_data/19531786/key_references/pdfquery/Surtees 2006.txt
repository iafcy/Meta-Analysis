(5-HTTLPR) Polymorphism and Major 
Depressive Disorder

Background: Recent evidence has suggested that the short allele of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene-linked polymorphic region 
(5-HTTLPR of the human serotonin gene [SLC6A4]) is associated with increased risk of depressive disorder but only among individuals 
exposed to social adversity. We report an investigation designed to replicate this finding. 
Methods: Data were available from a non-clinical sample of 4175 adult men and women, ages 41– 80 years, selected from 
participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition in Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk, United Kingdom) study. 
Evidence of past-year prevalent episodic major depressive disorder (MDD), defined by restricted DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, was 
assessed through questionnaire. Adverse experiences in childhood and in adulthood (during the five years preceding assessment) were 
also assessed through self-report. The 5-HTTLPR variant was genotyped according to published protocols. 
Results: One-year prevalent MDD criteria were met by 298 study participants. The experience of social adversity (both in childhood 
and adulthood) was strongly associated with increased rates of past-year prevalent MDD. No gene by environment (GxE) interactions 
between the 5-HTTLPR genotype, social adversity, and MDD were observed. 
Conclusions: This study has not replicated a previous finding of a GxE interaction between the 5-HTTLPR genotype, social adversity, 
and depression. 
Key Words: Depression, stress, serotonin transporter, 5-HTTLPR, 
SLC6A4, gene-environment interaction 

known for a wide variety of biological phenotypes, such as 
the thalassaemias (Weatherall 2001) and reactive spondylo- 
arthropathies (Scofield et al 1995). Few such interactions, how- 
ever, have been successfully characterized in relation to human 
psychiatric phenotypes, despite clear indications from nonhu- 
man mammal research that they exist. For example, investiga- 
tions of the genetic contribution of the serotonin transporter 
(5-HTT) to behavioral measures of anxiety in both rodents and 
nonhuman primates have indicated a moderating role of social 
adversity, most specifically during early stages of development 
(Ansorge et al 2004; Bennett et al 2002; Champoux et al 2002). 
Recently, Caspi et al (2003) reported that a length polymor- 
phism (SLC6A4) in the promoter region of 5-HTT (5-HTTLPR) 
mediates the influence of stressful life events on human depres- 
sion. They showed that individuals carrying one or more short 
(S) allele who were exposed to stressful life events were more 
likely to develop depression than those homozygous for the long 
(L) allele. They also reported that childhood maltreatment pre- 
dicted adult depression only among individuals carrying a copy 
of the S allele. 
This finding is intriguing for a number of reasons. First, as one 
of the few examples of a gene by environment (GxE) interaction, 
it provides an opportunity to investigate the phenomenon at a 
molecular level. Because of its potential importance, Caspi et al

the 
have emphasized the need for its replication. Second, 
interaction effects reported seem to be present in the absence of 
a main effect of the SLC6A4 promoter length polymorphism on 
depression. Although, historically, studies that have addressed 
this question in relation to (unipolar) depression have reached 
inconsistent conclusions, a recent large multicenter case-control 
study (involving 539 unipolar patients and 821 control subjects; 
Mendlewicz et al 2004) and a recent meta-analysis (Lasky-Su et al 
2005) have both reported no main effect, indicating that the main 
effect, if present, must be very small. Third, the reported effect 
was observed on depression occurring in the year before assess- 
ment (at age 26) for individuals experiencing stressful life events 
in the preceding five years. In contrast, the reported impact of life 
events is typically limited to the 1–3 months preceding the onset 
of a depressive episode (Brown et al 1973; Kendler et al 1998; 
Surtees et al 1986). 
We now report an attempt to replicate the GxE interaction 
between SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR) genotype, the experience of social 
adversity, and DSM-IV– defined (American Psychiatric Associa- 
large 
tion 1994) major depressive disorder (MDD) among a 
non-clinical sample of men and women participating in the 
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition in 
Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk), United Kingdom study (Day et al 1999). 


During 1993–1997, EPIC-Norfolk recruited, through general 
practice age-gender registers, a total of 30,414 men and women 
(then) ages 40 –74 years and resident in Norfolk, England (Day et 
al 1999). The study was approved by the Norwich District Health 
Authority Ethics Committee and all participants gave signed 
informed consent. During 1996 –2000, an assessment of social 
and psychological circumstances, on the basis of the Health and 
Life Experiences Questionnaire (HLEQ) (Surtees et al 2003b), 
was completed by a total of 20,921 participants, representing a 
response rate of 73.2% of the total eligible EPIC-Norfolk sample 
(28,582). A sample of 5000 participants was selected from the 
BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2006;59:224 –229

EPIC-Norfolk HLEQ cohort. This sample was originally designed 
for a study of neuroticism (Willis-Owen, in press) and included 
2500 men and 2500 women with DNA available, selected accord- 
ing to extremes of high and low neuroticism scores (assessed 
through completion of a 12-item scale; Eysenck et al 1985). The 
boundaries of high and low neuroticism varied by gender (high: 
scale score ranges 6 –12 and 8 –12 for men and women, respec- 
tively; and low: scale score ranges 0 –1 and 0 –2; see Willis-Owen, 
in press for further details). The final study sample consisted of 
4175 study participants for whom the SLC6A4 variant was 
successfully genotyped. 

The HLEQ includes a structured self-assessment approach to 
psychiatric symptoms embodying restricted DSM-IV (American 
Psychiatric Association 1994) criteria for MDD. The assessment 
was designed to identify those EPIC-Norfolk HLEQ participants 
thought likely to have met a putative diagnosis of MDD at any 
time in their lives. Where any episode was reported, participants 
were asked to estimate onset and (if appropriate) offset timings 
(see Surtees et al 2000 for full details of this assessment). The 
dependent variable was taken as 1-year prevalence of MDD (i.e., 
any episode that was either current at the time of or ended within 
1 year of HLEQ completion). In addition, this measure was 
refined according to neuroticism score, with cases defined as 
those with both 1-year prevalent MDD and high neuroticism, and 
with control subjects defined as those free of 1-year prevalent 
MDD and with low neuroticism. 

The HLEQ included an assessment of social adversity, defined 
by adverse experience in childhood (0 –16 years) and in adult- 
hood (represented by stressful life events and enduring personal 
difficulties). 
Adverse experience in childhood was assessed by the follow- 
ing eight circumstances: separation from mother for more than 1 
year; hospital stay for two or more weeks; parental divorce; 
parental unemployment for several years when they wanted to 
be working; an experience that was so frightening as to be 
thought about for years following its occurrence; being sent 
away from home because of doing something wrong; parental 
alcohol or drug use sufficient to cause family problems; and 
experience of physical abuse by someone close. An overall 
measure of childhood adverse experience was constructed as the 
total number of circumstances reported (Surtees et al 2003a; 
Wainwright and Surtees 2002a). 
Retrospective assessment of adverse event experience in 
adulthood was restricted to 16 specific events and a further 
undefined event of personal significance. Specific events in- 
volved serious illnesses (injuries or assaults) experienced by the 
participant (or a first degree relative), relationship events (con- 
cerning separation, divorce, termination of pregnancy), work 
events (retirement, redundancy, or being fired) and loss experi- 
ences (through death of first degree relatives). The undefined 
event provided an opportunity for the participant to describe 
(and rate) the lifetime experience of any other particularly 
stressful experience. Participants were asked to provide details of 
event timing to within a year of occurrence and a rating of their 
degree of upset (rated on a four-point scale) associated with each 
event experienced. These events were selected on the basis of 
the questionnaire version of the List of Threatening Experiences 
(LTE-Q) (Brugha et al 1985). Concurrent validity of the LTE-Q 
assessed against the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS; 
Brown and Harris 1978) has shown both high specificity and 
sensitivity (Brugha and Cragg 1990) (see Surtees and Wainwright 
1998, 2000 for further details). A calendar-based Personal Life 
Chart (PLC) was designed to allow each participant to record the 
date, description, and onset/offset times of (up to six) prolonged 
difficulties in their lives. The design format provided a brief way 
of representing periods of personal difficulty and stems from the 
methodological framework of the LEDS (Brown and Harris 1978) 
approach to the assessment of long-term difficulties adapted for 
use within a questionnaire format and to record experiences 
across a lifetime. Only those long-term difficulties reported to 
have been experienced by the study participant or close family 
(restricted to spouse/partner, parent, sibling, or child) were 
included. Adverse experience in adulthood was represented by 
the total number of moderately or extremely upsetting life events 
and/or a period of long-term difficulty reported to have been 
experienced during the past 5 years. In addition, these measures 
were refined to include only those adverse events and difficulties 
reported to have been experienced in the year preceding MDD 
episode onset (or time of HLEQ assessment for those with no 
1-year prevalent MDD). 

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from fresh 9-mL 
EDTA whole blood samples (Whatman International, Ely, United 
Kingdom) and arrayed onto 96 well plates. Two oligonucleotide 
primers (5=-GGCGTTGCCGCTCTGAATGC-3=, 5=-GAGGGACTGA- 
GCTGGACAACCCAC-3=) were used to generate SLC6A4 allele- 
specific fragments (484-base pair [bp], 528-bp) (Lerman et al 1998) 
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genotype was then ascer- 
tained by agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products, and visual- 
ized by transillumination. The PCR was initially performed in a 
10-(cid:1)L reaction including 5 (cid:1)L of DNA template (10 ng), and this was 
increased to a final volume of 15 (cid:1)L (16.8 ng DNA) where samples 
failed to produce amplification. Each 10-(cid:1)L reaction included 1 (cid:1)L 
NH4 buffer, .25 (cid:1)L dNTP (40 mmol/L), 2.35 (cid:1)L 2xPolymate (Bio- 
Line, London, United Kingdom), 0.3 (cid:1)L MgCl2 (50 mmol/L), 1 (cid:1)L 
primers, and .1 (cid:1)L BioTaq DNA Polymerase (BioLine). The PCR 
consisted of a 5-min denature step at 95°C (1 cycle), 95°C for 30 
seconds, 62°C for 45 seconds, and 72°C for 1 min (35 cycles), and 
72°C for 4 min (1 cycle). 

Logistic regression was used to investigate the presence of 
GxE interaction for past-year prevalent MDD. Models were fit for 
the main effect of SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR) genotype (included as 
L/L; L/S and S/S, assuming a multiplicative effect for the S allele 
and, correspondingly, a 1 degree of freedom test of trend [allele 
test]) and main effect of environment (with childhood adverse 
experience classified as 0, 1, and 2 or more and adult life events 
or long-term difficulty experience as 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more 
included as continuous variables, again with a 1 degree of 
freedom test of trend), and with subsequent addition of GxE 
interaction (through inclusion of the cross-product term for a 1 
degree of freedom test of multiplicative interaction). All models 
included gender as a covariate. Secondary analyses were per- 
formed to confirm the absence of significant GxE interaction in 
these data. Analyses were repeated 1) for the refined measure of 
adverse experience in adulthood (in the year before MDD onset), 
2) for lifetime MDD, 3) for the combined measure of past-year 
prevalent MDD and neuroticism, and 4) for past-year prevalent 
MDD by gender.

A total of 4175 genotype calls were made from a total of 4416 
individuals genotyped (a 94.5% genotype call rate). Of the 4175 
study participants, 2225 were men and 1950 were women. The 
age range of the sample was 41– 80 years (mean 60.3 years, SD 
9.1). Genotype frequencies were: L/L homozygotes, n (cid:2) 1391 
(33.3%); L/S heterozygotes, n (cid:2) 2029 (48.6%); and S/S homozy- 
gotes, n (cid:2) 755 (18.1%). Allele frequencies were in Hardy- 
Weinberg equilibrium [(cid:3)2(1) (cid:2) .10, p (cid:2) .75]. The 1-year preva- 
lence of MDD (in this neuroticism-enriched sample) was 7.1% (n (cid:2) 
298) and lifetime MDD prevalence was 18.3% (n (cid:2) 767). 
Past-year prevalence of MDD was 5.6%, 8.5%, and 10.1%, 
respectively, for those who reported 0, 1, and (cid:1) 2 adverse 
experiences in childhood, and was 2.9%, 5.5%, 11.2%, 14.5%, and 
26.8%, respectively, for those who reported 0, 1, 2, 3, and (cid:1) 4 life 
events or difficulties. No differences were observed by genotype, 
either in the mean number of reported adverse experiences in 
childhood (.78 for L/L, .77 for L/S, and .80 for S/S, p (cid:2) .75) or 
adverse experiences during adulthood (1.14 for L/L, 1.07 for L/S, 
and 1.05 for S/S, p (cid:2) .19).

adversity and their interaction on past-year prevalent MDD. The 
table confirms the absence of any main effect for genotype and 
the presence of strong main effects for environment (as repre- 
sented by either adverse experience in childhood or adult life 
events or difficulties) and reveals that no GxE interactions were 
observed in these data. 
Adverse adult events or difficulties were reported in the year 
before MDD onset/HLEQ completion by 930 participants (732 
[17.5%] reported one and 198 [4.7%] reported more than one 
event and/or difficulty in this 1-year period). This refined mea- 
sure of adult adverse events showed a stronger association with 
past-year MDD (OR (cid:2) 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.78 – 
2.51 per event) but, again, no GxE interaction with SLC6A4 
(5-HTTLPR) genotype was observed (OR (cid:2) .91, 95% CI .71– 
1.17). Nor was there a significant interaction between genotype 
and adverse events experienced in childhood or between geno- 
type and adult adverse experience (in the past 5 years) on the 
basis of a lifetime MDD phenotype. Finally, we found no 
evidence for a significant interaction between genotype and 
adverse experience in childhood or adult adverse experience for 
the combined measure of past-year prevalent MDD and neurot- 
icism (n (cid:2) 276 cases and n (cid:2) 2018 control subjects). 
A significant interaction was observed for past-year prevalent 
MDD and adverse experience in childhood among men (p (cid:2) 
.040) such that adverse experiences in childhood were associ- 
ated with increased rates of past-year prevalent MDD for L/L 
homozygotes (OR (cid:2) 1.69, 95% CI 1.17–2.44) but not for L/S 
heterozygotes (OR (cid:2) 1.26, 95% CI .91–1.75) or S/S homozygotes 
(OR (cid:2) .82, 95% CI .46 –1.48). This finding is in the opposite 
direction of that previously reported for a GxE interaction (Caspi

et al 2003; Figure 2). No GxE interactions were observed for 
adverse experience in childhood and past-year prevalent MDD 
among women or for adult adverse experience and past-year 
prevalent MDD in either men or women. With Bonferroni 
correction, according to the number of subgroup analyses per- 
formed, the interaction for adverse experience in childhood and 
past-year prevalent MDD in men was not significant (required p 
value for nine tests, p (cid:2) .006). 

This investigation was designed to attempt replication of a 
recent report of interaction between the experience of social 
adversity, the SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR) genotype, and past-year prev- 
alent MDD (Caspi et al 2003). Our results, on the basis of a 
sample of 4175 study participants, did not support such a GxE 
interaction. 
To our knowledge, five other human studies, to date, have 
focused on the relationship between the SLC6A4 genotype, 
social adversity, and mood-related phenotypes (Eley et al 2004; 
Gillespie et al 2005; Grabe et al 2005; Kaufman et al 2004; 
Kendler et al 2005). Of these studies, one (Gillespie et al 2005) 
reported no evidence of replication, and four studies provided 
evidence for replication, though on the basis of different catego- 
rizations of genotype (full [Kaufman et al 2004], additive [Eley et 
al 2004], recessive [Kendler et al 2005], and dominant [Grabe et al 
2005]). In addition, two of these studies found a result only when 
on the basis of a data subset (in both cases in women and not in 
men [Eley et al 2004; Grabe et al 2005]). Care is required in 
interpreting studies that only partially replicate an original study 
finding, because multiple testing can distort the type I error rate. 
Marginal evidence followed by partial replication does not 
provide strong evidence of association (Colhoun et al 2003). In 
addition, all of these replications were on the basis of small 
samples, of more limited statistical power than the population 
presented here. Our study carries approximately twice the 
number of MDD cases as in the original report by Caspi et al 
(2003); however, sample size requirements for interactions are 
approximately four times as great as those required for the 
detection of main effects of the same magnitude (Cooper 2003). 
Therefore, the current study, as in the other studies cited, remains 
underpowered to detect interactions other than those of large 
magnitude (Hwang et al 1994; Smith and Day 1984). 
Associations between genotype(s) and complex phenotypes 
are likely to be of modest effect size and large sample sizes with, 
perhaps, thousands of cases required to detect and confirm 
associations at appropriate levels of statistical significance 
(Keavney et al 2004; Pharoah et al 2004; Zondervan and Cardon 
2004). Where large sample sizes have been unavailable, many 
genetic association studies have employed liberal type I error 
rates (e.g., 5%) on the basis that, as few variants are studied, the 
need to correct for multiple comparisons is reduced (Freimer and 
Sabatti 2004). These studies should be followed by definitive 
replication (Thomas and Clayton 2004). 
This study differs markedly both in design and methodology 
from the report by Caspi et al (2003). These differences could 
explain our non-replication of study findings. In particular, 
participants in the original Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and 
Development Study were a representative birth cohort with 
repeated follow-up assessments with the GxE analyses on the 
basis of the cohort at age 26 years. In marked contrast, this study 
was on the basis of a single retrospective questionnaire assess- 
ment of a population cohort with age range 41– 80. Therefore, 
consideration needs to be given to the possibility that either the 
GxE interaction is restricted to younger age groups (for example, 
one recent partial replication was on the basis of a younger 
cohort [Kendler et al 2005]) or that the strength of the interaction 
varies with age and that the large and older age range in this 
study might have obscured any potentially positive result. 

In addition, the assessment of phenotype differed between 
the two studies. Participants in the birth cohort study were 
assessed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (Robins and 
Regier 1991) at ages 18, 21, and 26 years. An important conse- 
quence of these assessments is that most of the depressive 
episodes identified in the study were likely to be the participants’ 
first such experience. In contrast, in the present study, a single 
comprehensive structured self-assessment was employed to pro- 
vide evidence of each participant’s history of MDD episodes 
those 298 
(Surtees et al 2000). These data suggest 
participants who met one-year prevalent DSM-IV MDD criteria, 
for only 9.4% was this their first episode, giving further emphasis 
to the difference between this and the original birth cohort study. 
In addition, clinical observations and epidemiological evidence 
have grown to support a “kindling” hypothesis (Post 1992; Post 
and Weiss 1998) that the strength of the association between 
social adversity and the onset of MDD decays with progressively 
increasing number of previous episodes (Kendler et al 2000). 
Therefore, these observations combine to compound the differ- 
ences between this study and the original report by Caspi et al 
(2003). Our sample was enriched by participants meeting MDD 
criteria through implementation of an extreme-phenotype design 
to permit evaluation of an associated hypothesis (Willis-Owen, in 
press). As expected, the 1-year prevalence of MDD was much 
greater in the extreme high neuroticism group (13.2%) than in 
the low neuroticism group (1.1%). It remains possible that the 
absence of 
individuals with intermediate neuroticism scores 
might have acted to obscure any GxE interaction. 
Our measures of adverse exposure history, both in childhood 
and adulthood, were reported at rates that closely matched those 
reported in the original study; however, 
in the context of a 
research program designed to investigate the association be- 
tween diet and chronic disease incidence, the assessment of 
sexual abuse was considered inappropriate. Availability of the 
relative timings of measures of MDD onset, offset, and adverse 
event exposure in adulthood also permitted inclusion of only 
those events that occurred in the year before episode onset, and 
importantly, permitted exclusion of event exposures that fol- 
lowed episode onset. This refined measure of adverse exposure, 
again, provided no evidence for GxE interaction in these data. 
While population stratification could, 
theoretically, have im- 
this is unlikely to be an important 
pacted on our findings, 
consideration (Cardon and Palmer 2003), given 
the design 
characteristics of the EPIC-Norfolk HLEQ study. 
We acknowledge that study limitations might follow from the 
collection of episodic MDD state and social adversity exposure 
history data through self-report, through the retrospective recall 
of early adverse experience and through the potential confound- 
ing of current emotional state with recall of adverse experience. 
In the EPIC-Norfolk HLEQ cohort (n (cid:2) 20,921; age range 41– 80; 
SD 9.3), the lifetime prevalence of MDD is 15.4% and annual 
MDD prevalence is 5.2%. These MDD prevalence estimates (and 
age-gender distributions) are comparable to those from inter- 
view-based assessments from United Kingdom and international 
psychiatric epidemiology studies (Surtees et al 2000). In addition, 
analysis of EPIC-Norfolk HLEQ episodic mood state data has 
revealed only a small amount of compression of reported MDD 



episodes (clustering of episodes in the immediate pre-assess- 
ment period) (Surtees et al 2000) and has aided elucidation of the 
association between adverse event exposure history (including 
those experienced in childhood) and the onset (and recurrence) 
of depression (Wainwright and Surtees 2002a, 2002b). 
The GxE evidence reported by Caspi et al (2003) represents 
an exciting development in psychiatric genetic research. There- 
fore, the finding has provoked considerable interest. The small 
sample sizes of the original study and of the replication studies so 
far reported could account for differences between findings. In 
addition, the failure of the current study to replicate the finding 
of Caspi et al could be due to differences in research design and 
measures employed; however, the original finding was of mod- 
est statistical significance, and the authors emphasized the re- 
quirement 
replication. Subsequent evidence has been, 
largely, on the basis of studies that only partially replicate the 
original finding. In addition, large multicenter case-control stud- 
ies and meta-analyses suggest that if there is any direct associa- 
tion between SLC6A4 genotype and (unipolar) depression, it 
must be very small. Collectively, we believe that these consider- 
ations suggest that evidence, to date, is not supportive of a GxE 
interaction between the SLC6A4 genotype, social adversity, and 
depression.
