Modiﬁcation of the effect of life events on risk of depression by a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene promoter (5-HTTLPR) 
has been reported in child, adolescent, adult and elderly populations. Replication attempted on data collected from 1421 individuals aged 65 
and over from a French community study provided no evidence of a similar modifying effect. In the only analysis known to the authors to 
be carried out in an exclusively elderly, European population, this null ﬁnding remained consistent after restriction of analysis to prevalent or 
incident cases.

The common, 44 bp indel polymorphism in the serotonin 
transporter gene promoter (5-HTTLPR) has been found to 
modify the depressogenic effect of stressful life events, with 
the 5-HTTLPR “short” (s) allele of associated with increased, 
and the “long” (l) allele associated with reduced, inﬂuence 
(Caspi et al., 2003). This ﬁnding was recently replicated for 
late-life depression in Korea (Kim et al., 2007), but has not 
received further evaluation in an older community population 
or one where the functional inﬂuence of a recently identiﬁed 
SNP (rs25531) has been considered (Wendland et al., 2006).

In a French community sample of 1421 people aged 65+, 
recent (within 12 months) life-events were ascertained using 
a structured questionnaire and case-level depression was 
assessed using the MINI and CES-D schedules (Ritchie et al., 
2004). 5-HTTLPR genotype was assayed from blood samples 
and recoded according to rs25531 status (Wendland et al., 
2006). After two years, life events and depression were ascer- 
tained again using identical procedures. Interaction between 
life-events and 5-HTTLPR functional genotype was tested 
in binary logistic regression models with prevalent depres- 
sion at baseline and incident depression at follow-up as the 
dependent variable. 

5-HTTLPR functional genotype and life event frequencies 
at baseline were ll = 24.1%, sl = 47.4% and ss = 28.5% and

0 = 40.3%, 1 = 34.8% and 2 or more = 24.9%, respectively. 
Case-level depression was present in 3.1% according to MINI 
and 29.2% according to CES-D at this time. Incident depres- 
sion was present in 1.9% and 11.7% of the sample according 
to these instruments at follow-up. Results of the logistic 
regression analyses are displayed in Table 1. Stressful life- 
events were strongly associated with depression at baseline 
but not at follow-up. No main effect for 5-HTTLPR func- 
tional genotype or 5-HTTLPR functional genotype × life 
event interaction was evident for either depression measure 
or time point of assessment. 

In this sample of older people, we were not able to replicate 
the previously reported interaction between 5-HTTLPR and 
life-events as risk factors for depression. This outcome was 
unaffected by instrument used to identify depression, restric- 
tion of the analysis to incident cases or use of 5-HTTLPR 
genotype without reclassiﬁcation according to rs25531 (see 
Supplementary material). Previously, two studies of the 5- 
HTTLPR × life event interaction for depression have focused 
on older participants: a European study with a 41–80 year 
age-range which not did not ﬁnd an interaction (Surtees et 
al., 2006) and a Korean study with over 65’s only which did 
(Kim et al., 2007). One possible explanation for the differ- 
ence is the greater prevalence of the 5-HTTLPR s allele in 
the Korean sample (52.7% vs. 21.9% with an ss genotype), 
consistent with other East Asian populations. The Korean 
sample had also experienced more life events over the same 
time period (71.9% vs. 59.7% with >1 life event) and had a 
relatively high prevalence of the BDNF met allele that was 
found to be a modifying factor (Kim et al., 2007). It is possible 
that the relatively low number of risk factors leave the current 
analyses underpowered to detect an interaction. Another pos- 
sibility is that the interaction is risk- rather than, or as well as, 
age-speciﬁc and is only apparent in comparatively high-risk 
environments. Exploration of this hypothesis could involve 
assessment of subjective experience of stressful events, as per 
Kendler et al. (2005). The 5-HTTLPR × life-event interaction 
is an important ﬁnding which has been well replicated. Our 
results suggest that, for late-life depression at least, there may 
be inter-population heterogeneity that should be considered 
when interpreting future studies.
