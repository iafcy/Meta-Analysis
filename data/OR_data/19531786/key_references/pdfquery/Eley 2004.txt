Gene–environment interaction analysis of serotonin 
system markers with adolescent depression 
TC Eley, K Sugden, A Corsico, AM Gregory, P Sham, P McGuffin, R Plomin and IW Craig 

We report analyses from a study of gene–environment interaction in adolescent depression. 
The sample was selected from 1990 adolescents aged 10–20 years: those with depression 
symptoms in the top or bottom 15% were identified and divided into high or low environmental 
risk groups. DNA was obtained from 377 adolescents, representing the four quadrants of high 
or low depression and high or low environmental risk. Markers within, or close to, each of the 
serotonergic genes 5HTT, HTR2A, HTR2C, MAOA (monoamine oxidase type A) and tryptophan 
hydroxylase (TPH) were genotyped. Environmental risk group was a nonsignificant predictor 
and sex was a significant predictor of the depression group. HTR2A and TPH significantly 
predicted the depression group, independent of the effects of sex, environmental risk group 
and their interaction. In addition, there was a trend for an effect of 5HTTLPR, which was 
significant in female subjects. Furthermore, there was a significant genotype–environmental 
risk interaction for 5HTTLPR in female subjects only, with the effect being in the same 
direction as another 
reaffirming that an important source of genetic 
heterogeneity is exposure to environmental risk.

The past decade of research has revealed just how 
difficult it is to find genes that contribute to variance 
in complex traits.1 Progress in the area as a whole has 
been slow, reflecting the complexity of the aetiology 
of these traits. It is now widely recognized not only 
that there are both genetic and environmental influ- 
ences on almost every psychological trait and asso- 
ciated disorder, but that this genetic risk results from 
a large number of individually small effect sizes. 
Furthermore, genetic risks are likely to interact with 
environmental risks. As such, there is considerable 
heterogeneity in the effect of each genetic variant 
across different levels of environmental risk, with a 
small overall average effect size in the entire popula- 
tion.1 As a result, the analysis of the main effects will 
fail to identify genetic risks to the extent that they 
operate only in conjunction with environmental risk. 
Depression is an excellent example of a complex 
trait for which gene–environment interactions are 
likely to be important. 
In addition to the well- 
reported evidence for both genetic2 and environmen- 
tal3 influences on depressive symptoms in adoles- 
cence, behavioural genetic research has begun to 
provide evidence for interactions between individual 
familial, or genetic) vulnerability and

environmental stress in adolescent4,5 samples (de- 
scribed in more detail below). In this study, we 
interactions 
therefore examined gene–environment 
associated with risk for high levels of depression 
symptoms in adolescence, concentrating on loci 
implicated in the serotonin (5HT) system. 
Molecular genetic work has begun to identify 
targets and investigate their role as genetic risks for 
depression. The predominant theory for explaining 
the biological basis of depression has been the 
monoamine hypothesis, reflected in the development 
of antidepressants, that work on this system, most 
recently the important introduction of the serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).6 Other evidence implicat- 
ing the serotonin system includes the finding that 
there is increased density of the 5HT receptor 2A 
(5HT2A) receptor-binding sites in brain regions of 
depressed individuals who committed suicide7 and 
in platelets of depressed suicidal patients.8 Candidate 
gene studies in this area have examined markers from 
genes covering many steps at different stages within 
the 5HT system. First, there are results relating the 
functional polymorphism in the 5HT transporter gene 
promotor region (5HTTLPR) and neuroticism and 
other personality traits associated with anxiety and 
depression,9 which have been widely re-examined 
leading to both replications and nonreplications.10 
Research in this area has culminated recently in the 
demonstration that the variant associated with lower 
activity (short allele) confers risk for the development 
of depression in the presence of adverse life events.11 
Second, several receptor genes have been examined. 
For example, 5HT2A has been repeatedly investigated 
for association with depression, with both positive12 
and negative13 results, and has also been found to be 
associated with learned helplessness in rats, an 
animal model of depression.14 The C allele at the 
T102C SNP of the 5HT receptor 2A has also been 
associated with suicide15 and suicidal 
ideation,12 
although again there have also been negative find- 
ings.16 The 5HT receptor 2C (5HT2C) has also been 
explored, with some studies finding association with 
depression17 and bipolar affective disorder,18 while 
others do not.19 Third, monoamine oxidase type A 
in the degradation of 
(MAOA) acts as catalyst 
neurotransmitters, 
including 5HT, and has been 
examined with regard to a high-activity allele within 
a VNTR in the promotor region of MAOA, which is 
associated with a number of related phenotypes 
including major depression,20 suicide attempts,21 
panic disorder22 and neuroticism.20,23 Finally, trypto- 
phan hydroxylase (TPH1) is a rate-limiting enzyme in 
the synthesis of 5HT. 
It has been associated 
with somatic anxiety in unipolar depression,24 with 
and also 
paroxetine 
with suicide,26 while results from other studies are 
equivocal.27 




Environmental influences associated with depres- 
sion in adolescence can be broadly divided into two 
groups: child-specific risks and family-general risks. 
Child-specific risks include acute sources of stress 
such as life events and more chronic ongoing 
difficulties such as peer 
relationship problems. 
Family-general risks include parental psychopathol- 
ogy, which in the developmental psychology litera- 
ture 
of 
environmental risk,28 social adversity factors such as 
poverty or low SES29 and family-based stressful life 
events.4 Recent reports indicate that shared environ- 
mental influences, which are likely to be family- 
general risks, are particularly important 
for high 
levels of depression, while being relatively unim- 
portant for variation in the full range.30 For this reason 
in the present study, we chose to use a measure of 
family-based environmental risk and classified ado- 
lescents as high or low on this risk variable. 


Gene–environment interactions have recently be- 
gun to be identified. There are two main methods that 
have been used. The first 
indirect 
approach—showing that heritability of a phenotype 
varies as a function of environmental 
risk. For 
example, one study found that genetic risk for 
depression in adolescent girls was greater in the 
presence of life events.4 Another example comes from 
research on the sample used in the present study 
regarding the prediction of high levels of adolescent 
depression, which revealed an interaction between a 
variable reflecting familial risk for anxiety, depression 
and neuroticism in parents and lack of parental 
educational qualifications.5 However, a second and 
more direct approach is to assess specific aspects of 

Gene–environment interactions on adolescent depression 
TC Eley et al 
both the genetic and environmental risks. For exam- 
ple, an interaction has been demonstrated between 
adverse life events and the short allele of the 5HT 
transporter promoter on depression and suicidality in 
a study of young adults.11 To our knowledge, this 
current study is the first to examine gene–environ- 
ment interaction directly for adolescent depression. 
Adolescence is a particularly good time to conduct a 
study of this kind, as it is when many individuals will 
be experiencing their first onset of depression. We 
assessed interactions between five markers in the 5HT 
system (5HTTLPR, 5HT2A, 5HT2C, MAOA and TPH) 
and a composite measure of family-based environ- 
mental risk (parental education, social adversity and 
family life events) in the prediction of high levels of 
adolescent depression. We selected as markers simple 
sequence repeat motifs within or close to the genes. 
For some, there was evidence that they influenced 
gene activity and for others that their high informa- 
tion content conferred advantage through their po- 
tential 
putative 
functional variants. An additional advantage was that 
some of the markers chosen could be combined in a 
single tube multiplex reaction. 



Procedure 
the genetics of 
Adults screened for a study of 
depression and anxiety (GENESiS31), who had re- 
ported children living at home, were sent a letter 
asking them to pass on a booklet containing the short 
form of 
the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire 
(SMFQ)32 to any offspring aged 12–19 years. This 
measure consists of 13 statements such as ‘I did 
everything wrong’, which are rated on a three-point 
scale for frequency over the past 2 weeks. In this 
study we used a 4-point scale in order to gain more 
differentiation at the extremes, then converted the 
scale back to have a range of 0–26, with higher scores 
reflecting higher 
levels of depressive symptoms. 
Completed questionnaire booklets were returned by 
1900 adolescents (more details on this sample are 
given elsewhere5). The mean SMFQ score in this 
sample was 7.7 (SD ¼ 5.5), and those with scores 
greater than 12 or less than 3 on the SMFQ (roughly 
the top and bottom 15%, N ¼ 560) were selected for 
follow-up and sent buccal swab kits.33 In all, 377 
adolescents provided DNA (67%). Of this sample, 295 
adolescents were unrelated and the remaining 82 
were from sibling pairs. 
Family environmental risk was assessed using three 
variables. First, the level of family social adversity 
was assessed using the Social Problems Question- 
naire (SPQ),34 which has a four-point rating scale. The 
scale assesses problems relating to finances, housing, 
work, relationships and social difficulties. Second, 
parental educational level was assessed using an 
eight-point scale ranging from ‘No qualifications’ to 
‘Postgraduate degree (eg Masters, PhD)’, which was 
recoded such that higher scores reflected a poorer 


Gene–environment interactions on adolescent depression 
TC Eley et al 
level of education. Third, adverse life events were 
assessed with the 12-item ‘List of Threatening Events’ 
(LTE),35 which relates to the previous 6 months. These 
events related to the parent or family as a whole and 
included items relating to serious illness, bereave- 
ment, relationship breakdowns, unemployment and 
financial crisis. A composite environmental measure 
was created by standardizing and combining the 
individual environmental measures, and this was 
dichotomized into above and below the entire sample 
mean. 
The sample consisted of 93 (73 female), 117 (73 
female), 57 (25 female) and 110 (49 female) in the high 
depression high environmental risk, high depression 
low environmental risk, low depression high envir- 
onmental risk and low depression low environmental 
risk groups, respectively. The sex differences between 
these groups were highly significant, so we included 
sex in all analyses. There were no significant age 
differences between the four groups. 
Genotyping 
Markers from five genes within the serotonergic 
system were genotyped: 5HTT, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 
MAOA and TPH. Genotyping was carried out follow- 
ing previously published protocols, and for multi- 
allelic markers the alleles were binned into two 
groups. For the 5HT transporter, we analysed the 
promoter polymorphic region (5HTTLPR) following 
the method described by Gelernter et al.36 We 
categorized the alleles as either ‘long’ (L) or ‘short’ 
(S) as described by Lesch et al.9 For 5HT2A, we 
analysed the well-documented T102C SNP.37 For the 
5-HT2C promoter repeat polymorphism,38 the allele 
designated ‘allele 1’, which is associated with 
increased transcriptional activity in a haplotype 
construct, was analysed vs the remainder of 
the 
alleles. For MAOA, genotyping conditions and the 
classification of alleles into high (H) and low (L) 
functionality were as described by Deckert et al.22 For 
the 30 microsatellite of TPH,39 we examined the 198 bp 
allele (vs all other alleles), which we designated as 
allele 5, being the fifth from shortest fragment length 
found within this sample. We chose this allele on the 
basis of work from the adult GENESiS sample in 
which it was shown to be a significant predictor of a 
psychometrically derived measure of familial vulner- 
ability to depression and related traits. Although 
TPH2 could also be considered to be of interest as it is 
expressed in the brain stem of mice, 
rats and 
humans,40 we did not genotype this marker as the 
expression data on TPH1 and TPH2 from within our 
own laboratories, suggesting that both forms are 
expressed at approximately equal levels in the brain 
(K Sugden personal communication), thus indicating 
that data from either can stand alone on their own 
merits. Further work on SNP analysis of relevant loci 
is in progress, but beyond the scope and time scale for 
this investigation. All genotyping was conducted 
blind to depression and environmental group mem- 
bership. 
Analyses 
For the first stage of the analyses w2’s were calculated 
to examine the main effects of genotype on the 
depression groups. Second, we used STATA41 to 
compute multivariate logistic regressions to examine 
the joint effects of several variables in predicting the 
depression group. Furthermore, this analysis can take 
into account clustering within a data set due to 
nonindependent observations. As there were 41 
sibling pairs within the data set, there were non- 
independent observations, which would lead to an 
underestimation of confidence intervals in standard 
analyses. The ‘robust, cluster’ option was therefore 
used to take these related observations into account in 
order to utilize the entire data set. The variables 
entered into each analysis were sex, environmental 
risk group, the interaction between sex and environ- 
mental risk group, genotype and gene–environment 
interaction. No complications from ethnic stratifica- 
tion were anticipated as a latent class analysis of 
genotype data from a whole genome scan on the 
parents of the selected individuals found no evidence 
for population heterogeneity (Matthew Nash and Pak 
Sham 2003, personal communication). 

The genotype frequencies within the two depression 
groups are given in Table 1, separately for the two 
sexes, for MAOA and 5HT2C, given their location on 
the X-chromosome. All markers were in Hardy– 
Weinberg equilibrium. As can be seen, a significant 
association with depression was observed for HTR2A, 
with the T allele more common in the high depression 
group. There was also a trend in the males for MAOA. 
However, these simplistic analyses do not take into 
account either the sex of the individual (apart from 
markers on the X-chromosome), their environmental 
risk group or interactions between these effects. In 
order to model these effects concurrently, we con- 
ducted a series of multiple logistic regressions. Initial 
analyses indicated a significant main effect of sex on 
depression group, with 70% of the high depression 
group being female as compared to 43% of the low 
depression group, an odds ratio (OR) of 2.84. 
Environmental risk group did not significantly pre- 
dict depression group, but there was a nonsignificant 
trend indicating an interaction between sex and 
environmental group, such that the excess of females 
with high depression symptom scores was more 
extreme in the high environmental risk group (80%). 
In the multiple logistic regression analyses, the OR 
for sex, environmental risk group and their interac- 
tion were 2.13 (P ¼ 0.006), 0.89 (P ¼ 0.75) and 2.20 
(P ¼ 0.09), respectively. In addition to these three 
parameters, we then incorporated each genotype and 
the interaction with the environmental stress group 
resulting in five separate multiple logistic regressions, 
one for each marker. The results for the effects of each 
genotype and the interaction between this and 
environmental risk group are given in Table 2. For

5HTTLPR, there was a nonsignificant trend indicating 
an overall decrease in odds of depression for an 
increasing number of ‘short’ alleles (OR ¼ 0.69) and a 
nonsignificant interaction between this genotype and 
environmental risk. However, in female subjects, the 
main effect of ‘short’ alleles was significant, with an 
OR of 0.56 (CI ¼ 0.32–0.96, P ¼ 0.03). Similarly, in 
female subjects the interaction with the environmen- 
tal group was significant, with an OR of 2.82 
(CI ¼ 1.12–7.12, P ¼ 0.03). For 5HT2A, the T allele 

confers significantly increased risk of depression 
(OR ¼ 1.61), 
the odds of severe 
depressive symptoms in the adolescent rise by a 
factor of 1.61 for each additional T allele. The 
interaction between 5HT2A and environmental risk 
group was not significant. For both 5HT2C and 
MAOA, 
the main effects and interactions with 
environmental risk group were all nonsignificant. 
For TPH1, allele 5 (198 bp fragment length) had a 
significant protective effect, such that each additional 

and 5HTTLPR and environmental 
prediction of depression group membership. 

Results indicated that for 5HT2A, there was a 
protective effect of 
the T allele, consistent with 
previous reports that the C allele is a risk factor for 
suicide ideation within a major depressive disorder.12 
These data are also in line with findings that the 
density of 5HT2A receptors is increased in the brain 
regions of depressed suicide victims7 and in the 
platelets of suicidal individuals with a major depres- 
sion.8 These data indicate that 5HT2A remains an 
important 
for molecular genetic work in 
depression and related phenotypes. 

Results for TPH revealed a protective effect for 
allele 5 (fragment length 198 bp). This allele was 
considered as it was found to be putative in the adult 
study, GENESiS.42 However, as was noted in the 
original univariate analyses, there was no robust main 
effect in this sample independent of sex and environ- 
mental group, so further replication is required to 
examine this finding. Recently, a novel TPH gene 
(TPH2) has been described, which appears to be 
mainly responsible for TPH activity in the murine 
brain.40 Nevertheless, given the currently available 
evidence, 
this situation may not be the case in 
humans as the reported sequence of cDNA derived 
from the human brain is from the TPH1 gene rather 
than the TPH2 gene.43 However, it will be of interest 
to study the expression pattern of TPH2 and any 
potential association of 
it with anxiety and/or 
depression. 
For 5HTTPLR, there was a significant risk from the 
‘short–short’ genotype, but only for girls in the high 
environmental risk group. Indeed, the overall (non- 
significant) trend suggests an association of the short 
allele with low depressive symptoms groups. This is 
particularly interesting as the observations replicate 
in part recent findings from another study, which 
found that the short allele of the 5HTTPLR interacts 
with life events to increase risk for depression and 
suicidality.11 The main difference between the two 
sets of results is that in our study the increased risk of 
those with both the short–short 
depression for 
genotype and high environmental risk was only 
present for girls, whereas in the study of adults the 
finding applied to both sexes (K Sugden, personal 
communication). However, it should also be noted 
that our sample consisted of 
individuals in the 
adolescent age range, rather than young adulthood. 
Hormonal fluctuations in female subjects, starting in 
adolescence, may be especially relevant to mood 
disorders, which are twice as common in females as 
they are in males.44 These findings are also in line 
with another recent study that revealed an interaction 
between the short allele of the 5HTTLPR and fearful 
stimuli on increased amygdala activity in adults.45 
Furthermore, these results are consistent with re- 
search in animals on the topic, including an interac- 
tion between the 5HTTLPR, stress and increased 
in mice,46 and an interaction 
fearful behaviour 
between 5HTTLPR, stressful-rearing conditions and

allele 5 roughly halves the odds of being in the high 
depression group once sex and environmental risk are 
taken into account. There was also a nonsignificant 
interaction between TPH1 and environmental risk 
group. This was found to be significant in the male 
subjects with an OR of 4.99 (CI ¼ 1.03–24.26, 
Po0.05), although the effect was largely due to a 
small group of male subjects in the high environ- 
mental risk group with the ‘TT’ genotype, none of 
whom were in the high depression group. As a result 
of this small group leading to this finding, this result 
is not interpreted further. 
It is of note that the interaction between 5HTTLPR 
and the environmental risk group is significant in the 
larger group of female subjects (total N ¼ 216), and is 
in the same direction as the only other published data 
examining gene–environment 
interactions for this 
marker in depression. 
In order to illustrate this 
interaction, the proportion of female subjects in the 
high depression group by 5HTTLPR genotype for the 
two environmental risk groups is given in Figure 1. As 
can be seen from the figure, an increase in the number 
of ‘short’ alleles increases the likelihood of being in 
the high depression group for females within the high 
environmental risk group, such that those with two 
‘short’ alleles are at nearly twice the risk of being in 
the high depression group as compared to those with 
two ‘short’ alleles but low environmental risk. 

This study is the first to report an analysis of the main 
effects and interactions between markers in the 5HT 
system and environmental risk on adolescent depres- 
sion. We found evidence for the main effects of 
5HT2A, TPH and of 5HTTLPR in female subjects only. 
In addition, we found evidence, albeit only in one of 
the sexes each, for interactions between both 5HT2A 

high environmental risk 
low environmental risk 

decreased serotonergic function in rhesus monkeys.47 
What clearly emerges from these studies is that the 
effects of 5HTTLPR are dependent on environmental 
stress. This may in part explain the difficulties seen 
in trying to replicate the original association between 
the 5HTTLPR and neuroticism and other anxiety- and 
depression-related traits.48 
At face value, the recent observations suggest that 
the short (low-activity) allele of 5HTTPR is a risk 
factor for depression may appear to be unexpected, 
given the efficacious prescription of SSRIs. However, 
much remains to be understood concerning the 
activity of 5HT at the synapse and its significance 
with respect to affective symptoms and disorders. The 
time course of the effects of SSRI drugs suggests that 
neurogenesis may be required for their activity.49 The 
possibility of changes in concentrations of pre- and 
postsynaptic 5HT receptors makes simplistic inter- 
pretations untenable and it is possible that drug 
effects may interact with other neurotransmission 
pathways. The hope must be that accumulated data 
from studies that examine the polymorphic variants 
at most, or all of the significant loci implicated in 5HT 
system and their interaction with environmental 
measures, will eventually lead to a clearer under- 
standing of the important parameters in understand- 
ing and treating depression. 
This study benefits from a number of strengths 
including a large sample size and unusual but 
important age-range (mid to late adolescence), when 
there is a high rate of first onsets of depression. The 
sample also gains power from the selected extremes 
design. However, there are also a number of limita- 
tions. First, the number of individuals in the four 
‘depression by environmental risk’ groups differed, 
with the group in high environmental risk but low 
depression being only around half the size of the 
other three groups. While this may be expected, it 
does reduce the power of 
this specific group. 
Furthermore, 
the sex distribution across the four 
groups was not consistent, with a high preponderance 
of 
female subjects in the high relative to low 
depression groups. Again, this would be expected, 
given the frequency differences in depression be- 
tween girls and boys from adolescence onwards. 
Replication of these analyses is clearly paramount, 
but as a result of these distributions, it would be 
particularly beneficial to examine these findings in a 
sample with a high number of those at high environ- 
mental risk but low depression, and of male subjects 
with high levels of depression. Second, many of our 
results were significant only at the 0.05 level, and this 
also adds to the need for replication. We have 
therefore presented confidence intervals 
for all 
our ORs. Our use of a selected extremes design 
increased power relative to an unselected sample, but 
nonetheless a larger sample would be of benefit. 
However, it should be noted that in order to halve the 
confidence interval, we would need to quadruple the 
sample size. Third, the measure of depression used 
was a self-report questionnaire rather than a diagnos- 
Gene–environment interactions on adolescent depression 
TC Eley et al 
tic interview. Thus, the individuals with high levels 
of depression would not necessarily approach the 
criteria for a major depressive disorder. However, we 
selected the top 15% on our depression measure, so 
the sample is likely to reflect those with symptom 
levels approaching clinical significance. Finally, our 
measure of environmental stress was parent reported 
and related to family-wide aspects of environmental 
risk rather than child-specific aspects of the environ- 
ment. Although this has the important benefit of 
providing a different source of information for the 
measure of depression (adolescent self-report) and the 
measure of environmental 
report), 
future studies would also benefit 
from assessing 
individual-specific environment directly from the 
adolescents themselves. 


this study considered the role of 
markers in the serotonergic system for adolescent 
depression. Furthermore, we examined the combined 
influence of genotype, sex and environmental risk and 
their 
interactions on depression symptoms. Both 
HTR2A and TPH significantly predicted high levels 
of depression symptoms, with a significant effect for 
5HTTLPR in female subjects only. There were also 
significant interactions with environmental risk for 
both 5HTLPR (in females) and TPH (in males) 
consistent with the hypothesis that there is hetero- 
geneity in the effects of genetic risks, which may only 
be an impact on subgroups of the population. One of 
these findings (5HTTLPR) partially replicates recent 
data in the adult literature, indicating that this is likely 
to be more than a chance effect. While these results are 
clearly preliminary and in need of further replication, 
they indicate that further work is needed both with 
adolescent samples and using interaction approaches.
