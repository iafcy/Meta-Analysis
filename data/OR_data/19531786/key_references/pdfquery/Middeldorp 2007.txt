Abstract We studied the association between the 
short/long promotor-based length polymorphism of 
the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) and 
neuroticism, anxiety and depression. Subjects included 
twins, their siblings and parents from the Netherlands 
Twin Register (559 parents and 1,245 offspring). 
Subjects had participated between one and ﬁve times 
in a survey study measuring neuroticism, anxiety and 
these families were also 
depression. Offspring of 
approached to participate in a psychiatric interview 
diagnosing DSM-IV major depression. Within-family 
and total association between 5-HTTLPR and these 
traits were tested. Only three of the 36 tests showed a 
signiﬁcant effect of 5-HTTLPR (P < 0.05). These 
effects were in opposite directions, i.e. both negative 
and positive regression coefﬁcients were found for the s 
allele. No additive effect of the s allele was found for

In 1996, Lesch et al. (1996) reported an association 
between the promoter-based length polymorphism of 
the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) and the 
anxiety-related personality traits neuroticism and harm 
avoidance. The 5-HTTLPR is deﬁned by a length 
variation of a repetitive sequence with the short and the 
long fragment consisting of respectively 484 and 528 
basepairs. In vitro analyses showed that the basal 
activity of the long variant was about threefold higher 
than that of the short variant, indicating that this is a 
functional polymorphism (Heils et al. 1996). As the 
association of the short variant with higher neuroticism 
and harm avoidance scores was found in two indepen- 
dent groups of subjects as well as within families, this 
seemed a very promising result (Lesch et al. 1996). The 
association between 5-HTTLPR and anxiety-related 
personality traits or depressive psychopathology has 
been investigated in numerous studies since then, but 
with conﬂicting results. Even meta-analyses on the 
association between 5-HTTLPR and personality traits 
(Munafo et al. 2003; Munafo et al. 2005a; Schinka et al. 
2004; Sen et al. 2004) or affective disorders (Lasky-Su 
et al. 2005; Lotrich and Pollock 2004) reached conﬂict- 
ing conclusions. This might be partly due to method- 
the meta-analyses 
between 
ological 




(Munafo et al. 2005b; Schinka 2005; Sen et al. 2005). 
Munafo et al. (2005b), therefore, stated that ‘‘Very 
large, well designed primary studies remain the most 
reliable way of obtaining reproducible results’’. 
Such a study was performed by Willis-Owen et al. 
(2005). An association study was carried out in three 
independent samples including respectively 564, 1,001 
and 5,000 subjects selected from two general popula- 
tions based on extreme high or low scores on neuro- 
ticism. Their samples retained virtually 100% power to 
detect a genetic effect accounting for just 0.5% of 
phenotypic variance at an alpha level of 0.05. They 
did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant association between 
5-HTTLPR and neuroticism measured with the 
Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck and 
Eysenck 1975) or major depression as deﬁned by the 
DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association 1994). 
We collected measures of neuroticism, as well as 
measures of anxiety, depression and DSM-IV based 
diagnoses of depression in a large sample of Dutch 
twin families. Association tests were carried out in 
a sample of 1,800 subjects who were genotyped for 
5-HTTLPR. The self report measures of neuroticism, 
anxiety and depression were assessed ﬁve times in a 
time period of around ten years. This made it possible 
to carry out analyses on the scores from the different 
time points to test whether effects replicated across 
time, as well as on the mean scores over the occasions. 
DSM-IV major depression data, diagnosed with a 
structured psychiatric interview, were also investigated 
for an association with 5-HTTLPR. In addition to 
testing multiple phenotypes repeatedly over time, the 
family based sample, allowed testing for population 
stratiﬁcation by decomposing the association effect in a 
between and within family component (Fulker et al. 
1999). A signiﬁcant within-family effect 
indicates 
genuine association whereas a signiﬁcant between 
family effect may be due to population stratiﬁcation. 
It is important to note that population stratiﬁcation 
cannot only result in spurious associations, but can also 
obscure genuine associations (Posthuma et al. 2004). 


This study is part of an ongoing longitudinal survey 
study of the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) that has 
assessed families with adolescent and adult 
twins 
roughly every two years since 1991 (Boomsma et al. 
2002). Each survey was sent to the twins and additional 
family members, namely parents in 1991 and 1993, 


siblings in 1997 and 2000 and parents and siblings in 
1995 and 2002. Each survey collected information on 
personality and psychopathology, although less exten- 
sive in the 1995 wave. As part of a project aiming to 
ﬁnd the genes underlying the susceptibility to anxiety 
informative families were 
and depression, 
selected from this database. For a detailed description 
of the selection and the data collection, see Boomsma 
et al. (2000) and Middeldorp et al. (2006). In short, the 
selection strategy was based on the recommendation of 
Eaves and Meyer (1994) and Risch and Zhang (1995) 
to select 
for genotyping who score 
extreme (high/high, low/low, low/high or high/low) on 
a quantitative scale of interest. Simulation studies have 
shown the optimal selection percentages for linkage 
analysis in sibling pairs from random samples (Dolan 
and Boomsma 1998). Concordant sibling pairs were 
selected when both had scores in the top 12% or in the 
bottom 12% of 
the phenotypic distribution. For 
discordant pairs, an ‘asymmetrical’ criterion was used. 
Sibling pairs were selected if one had a score in the 
top 25% and the other in the bottom 20% or vice 
versa. A quantitative factor score expressing a subject’s 
genetic susceptibility to ‘anxious depression’ was used 
for the selection. The genetic factor scores were 
derived from a multivariate genetic analysis of the 
anxiety, depression, neuroticism and somatic-anxiety 
data that showed that the covariance between these 
traits was explained by a common genetic factor 
(Boomsma et al. 2000). 
A factor score was calculated for 7,836 twins and 
siblings who participated at least once in the 1991, 1993 
or 1997 survey. Subjects who missed one or more of the 
inventories that measured neuroticism, anxiety, somatic 
anxiety or depression were excluded. Based on these 
factor scores, 561 families were selected in which two 
siblings had extreme factor scores. All members of the 
selected families, regardless of their value on the 
genetic factor score, were asked to provide a buccal 
swab for DNA isolation. Twins and siblings of these 
families were also asked to participate in a diagnostic 
psychiatric interview. Two hundred and ﬁfty four 
fathers, 305 mothers, 501 male and 744 female offspring 
of 466 participating families, all aged between 16 and 65 
years, were genotyped for 5-HTTLPR. The offspring 
consists of 327 MZ twins and 918 DZ twins or siblings 
with on average 2.7 siblings per family. The psychiatric 
interview was administered to 1,256 twins and siblings 
of whom 989 were also genotyped for 5-HTTLPR. 
Table 1 shows the distribution of the genetic factors 
scores in the total offspring sample, the offspring 
genotyped for 5-HTTLPR and offspring who parti- 
cipated in the interview. An individual was assigned to

a Factor scores were calculated in 1991, 1993 and 1997. A subject is assigned to a group based on his lowest or highest score of these 
three occasions. Subjects who score above the 75th percentile on one occasion and below the 25th percentile on another are classiﬁed 
in a separate group 
b For sixteen twins and siblings, who participated in the CIDI, a factor score is missing 
c For ten twins and siblings, who were genotyped for 5-HTTLPR, a factor score is missing 

one of the groups (score below 25th percentile, above 
75th percentile, or in between) based on the highest or 
lowest factor score in 1991, 1993 or 1997. This explains 
how, 
the percentages of 
extreme scoring subjects are higher than 25%. The 
selection was also based on the highest or lowest 
genetic factor score on these three occasions. Subjects 
who scored high on one occasion and low on another 
were assigned to a separate group. Table 1 shows that 
the genotyped sample is similar to the total sample, 
probably due to the inclusion of all family members of 
the extreme scoring sibling pairs. The subjects who 
scored somewhat more 
participated in the CIDI 
extreme than the total sample. 

Association analyses were performed on the anxiety, 
neuroticism and depression scales. The scores on these 
instruments were used to calculate the genetic factor 
scores. In 1991, 1993, 1997, 2000 and 2002, anxiety 
was measured with the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety 
Inventory – Trait version (STAI) (Spielberger et al. 
1970; Van der Ploeg et al. 1979) and neuroticism 
was measured with the Amsterdamse Biograﬁsche 
Vragenslijst (Wilde 1970), which 30-item neuroticism 
scale is modelled after the neuroticism scale of the 
Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck and 
Eysenck 1964). In 1991, 1995, 1997, 2000 and 2002, 
anxious depression was measured with the Young 
Adult Self Report (YASR) (Achenbach 1990; Verhulst 
et al. 1997). The scores were log transformed following 
earlier analyses of these data (Boomsma et al. 2000). 
Cross-sectional correlations between the scores on 
these three scales varied from 0.60 to 0.75 (Middeldorp 
et al. 2006). Longitudinal correlations for the neuro- 
ticism, anxiety and depression scores ranged from 0.58 
for neuroticism and 0.62 for anxiety measured at 1991 
and 1993 and from 0.36 for depression and 0.50 for 

neuroticism measured at 1991 and 1997 (Boomsma 
et al. 2000). 
Association analyses were carried out on the scores 
from each survey separately. In addition, the neuro- 
ticism, anxiety and depression scores were averaged 
over all surveys in which each subject had participated. 
Thus for example in the case of neuroticism, 
if a 
subject had participated once, this neuroticism score 
was used as the mean score. If a subject had partici- 
pated twice, the average of these scores were used as 
the mean score. Association analyses of the mean 
scores have as advantage that all available data are 
used, while measurement error is minimized because 
part of the error is averaged out. 
All offspring of selected families were asked to 
participate in a telephone interview, during which the 
computerized version of the Composite International 
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) (World Health Organi- 
zation 1992) was administered to obtain lifetime DSM- 
IV diagnoses of mood and anxiety disorders. The CIDI 
is a fully standardized diagnostic interview. No infor- 
mation on the reliability and validity of the Dutch 
version of the CIDI is available, but good reliability 
and validity have been reported for the English version 
of the CIDI (Andrews and Peters 1998). All inter- 
viewers were trained by the Dutch World Health 
Organization training center. In order to minimize 
observer bias, interviewers were unaware of intervie- 
wees’ scores on the initial selection variables through- 
out the study. 

The 5-HTT regulatory gene region was ampliﬁed using 
a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of oligonucleotide 
primers 5¢-GAGGGACTGAGCTGGACAACCCAC 
(Greenberg et al. 1999) and 5¢-ATGCCAGCACCT- 
AACCCCTAATGT (Gelernter et al. 1997). PCR was 
performed in a 40 ll volume containing 10 ng of 


genomic template, 0.33 mM of each primer, 0.4 mM 
deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 2.5% dimethyl sulfox- 
ide (DMSO),1.6 units of rTaq DNA polymerase 
(Amersham Biosciences). Initial denaturation at 94(cid:2)C 
for 3 min. was followed by denaturation at 94(cid:2)C for 
30 s, annealing at 59(cid:2)C for 30 s, and extension at 72(cid:2)C 
for 1 min 30 s for 35 cycles. The PCR procedure was 
terminated by extension at 72(cid:2)C for 6 min. Ampliﬁed 
469/513 bp fragments were electrophoresed through 
2% agarose and were visualized by ultraviolet illumi- 
nation upon ethidium bromide staining. 

Power analyses of the family and total association 
analyses were carried out with the Genetic Power 
Calculator designed by Purcell et al. (2003). Associa- 
tion between the ss, sl and ll variants of 5-HTTLPR, 
and the quantitative traits were investigated by mode- 
lling an additive effect of the s-allele with sex included 
as a ﬁxed effect. These analyses were carried out in 
QTDT using the test that models total association 
(Abecasis et al. 2000a). To exclude population strati- 
ﬁcation, the association was also tested in the orthog- 
onal model as deﬁned in QTDT. In this model, the 
association is decomposed into a between- and within- 
family association effect with a signiﬁcant within family 
association effect indicating a genuine effect (Abecasis 
et al. 2000a; Fulker et al. 1999). Equal within- and 
between-family effects indicate the absence of popula- 
tion stratiﬁcation (Abecasis et al. 2000a; Fulker et al. 
1999). In each analysis, the dependency among indi- 
viduals from the same pedigree was modelled as a 
function of their genetic relatedness. 
Differences between the prevalences of DSM-IV 
major depression for the three genotypes were tested 
with a permutation v2 test using StatXact (1992). 
Population stratiﬁcation was evaluated with the trans- 
mission disequilibrium test (TDT) in QTDT (Abecasis 
et al. 2000b). 
A P-value below 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant, even 
though multiple tests were carried out. An important 
feature of our study is replication as indicated by the 
agreement between the results for different time points. 
If, for example, we would ﬁnd that the test on the mean 
score over the occasions is signiﬁcant as well as four 
of the ﬁve tests on the scores across occasions with 
P-values between 0.01 and 0.04, an association with 
5-HTTLPR would seem likely. 

Table 2 gives the number of subjects and their mean 
age available for the total association and the within 
family association tests of the neuroticism, anxiety and 
depression data. The number of subjects that partici- 
pated in the CIDI is also shown. It is important to note 
that in the total association test, phenotypic data of 
parents as well as siblings are used, whereas in the 
within family association test only the phenotypic data 
of the siblings are analysed. In the latter test, the 
parents only provide genotypic information. As can be 
seen in Table 2, phenotypic parental data were avai- 
lable for anxiety and neuroticism measured in 1991, 
1993 and 2002 and for depression measured in 1991 
and 2002. The total number of subjects for the analyses 
of the averaged scores across occasions is higher for 
neuroticism and anxiety than for depression, as in 1993, 
neuroticism and anxiety were also assessed in the 
parents, while in 1995 depression was only assessed in 
the twins and siblings. 
The power of the study was calculated for the 
analyses of the smallest and largest sample of siblings

i.e. the sample that participated in 1991 and the sample 
used to analyse the mean scores. When data from 
parents are not considered and sib ships are deﬁned as 
pairs, the power to ﬁnd an effect explaining 5% of the 
variance with an P-level of 0.05 is 0.90 for the smallest 
sample and virtually 1.0 for the largest sample. 
The null hypothesis of Hardy Weinberg Equilib- 
rium, tested in the total sample, was not rejected. The 
allele frequencies of 57% for the long allele and 43% 
for the short allele were similar to the frequencies 
reported by Lesch et al. (1996). Table 3 shows the 
mean neuroticism, anxiety and depression scores for 
each occasion and across the ﬁve occasions as well as 
the results of the tests for association and population 
stratiﬁcation. None of the total association tests were 
signiﬁcant with the exception of neuroticism measured 
in 2000 for which a positive regression coefﬁcient for 
the s allele was found. The results of the between and 
within family association tests showed that anxiety and 
neuroticism measured in 1991 were signiﬁcantly asso- 
ciated with 5-HTTLPR. Population stratiﬁcation 
seemed to counteract the effect, since the total asso- 
ciation tests for anxiety and neuroticism measured in 
1991 were not signiﬁcant. However, the effect was in 
the opposite direction, i.e. the with a negative within- 
family regression coefﬁcient for the s allele. 
The analyses on the mean neuroticism, anxiety and 
depression scores over the ﬁve occasions showed no 
signiﬁcant results neither for the total association test 
nor for the within family association test. This also 

becomes clear from Table 3, which shows that the 
scores of the subjects in the three groups of genotypes 
are remarkably similar. 
Table 4 shows the number of subjects diagnosed 
with major depression per genotype. The v2 test was 
signiﬁcant with a P-value of 0.044 and remained 
signiﬁcant after 2,000 and 10,000 permutations with 
P-values of 0.045 and 0.042. This is due to the group of 
heterozygotes who appear to have a higher risk for 
depression than both homozygous groups. TDT did not 
show a signiﬁcant association. 
Table 5 gives the results for three additional ana- 
lyses on the mean neuroticism, anxiety and depression 
scores over the ﬁve occasions, resulting in the largest 
possible sample size. An earlier article suggested that 
the effect of 5-HTTLPR is largest in subjects scoring in 
the middle of the distribution (Sirota et al. 1999). Our 
selection could have obscured such an effect, although 
Table 1 shows that there is no obvious effect on the 
distribution of the factor scores of the selection on the 
total genotyped sample. Since not only selected sibling 
pairs but also their family members were approached

for this study, it was possible to repeat our analyses 
including only the subjects scoring between the 25th 
and 75th percentile on the genetic factor score on all 
occasions. No association was found. On the other 
hand, it is also conceivable that the effect is largest in 
the subjects on which the selection was based and that 
we did not ﬁnd the effect because we also included 
non-extreme scoring family members. However, trying 
to maximize the effect of 
the selection by only 
including the families with sibling pairs scoring con- 
cordant high or low in the analyses did not change the 
results either. Another reason no effect was found 
could be that the neuroticism scores of young subjects 
are not reliable since their personality is still 
in 
development. Therefore, the analyses were repeated 
in a sample consisting of subjects aged over 30 years. 
These analyses converged with the other analyses in 
not showing an association with 5-HTTLPR. 

The general picture emerging from these analyses 
clearly suggests no association between 5-HTTLPR 
and self report measures of neuroticism, anxiety and 
depression or DSM-IV major depression. These results 
support the conclusion of Willis-Owen et al. (2005) 
that 
the 5-HTTLPR variant does not contribute 
signiﬁcantly to neuroticism, anxiety or depression. 
The results of the additional analyses on three sub- 
samples indicate that the chance of a false negative 
ﬁnding is minimal. Finally, it was considered that the 
signiﬁcant v2 test for DSM-IV major depression could 
indicate that there is no additive or dominance effect, 
but that a mechanism called negative heterosis plays a 
role (Comings and MacMurray 2000). Since the TDT 
models an additive effect, the absence of a signiﬁcant 
result does not exclude the possibility of heterosis. 
Negative heterosis signiﬁes that having a heterozygous 
genotype is disadvantageous. Association studies of 
DRD2 gene polymorphisms and alcoholism or ADHD 
have suggested that this mechanism might play a role in 
psychiatric conditions (Comings and MacMurray 2000). 
However, only one out of eleven other studies investi- 
gating the association between 5-HTTLPR and major 
depression also found that heterozygous subjects are 
more at risk than the homozygotes, indicating that it 
is highly unlikely that negative heterosis is present 
(Bellivier et al. 1998; Collier et al. 1996; Frisch et al. 
1999; Furlong et al. 1998; Hauser et al. 2003; Hoehe 
et al. 1998; Kunugi et al. 1997; Mendlewicz et al. 2004; 
Rees et al. 1997; Serretti et al. 2002; Willis-Owen et al. 
2005). 
Our results also show how associations can be found 
by coincidence. Had we chosen to report exclusively 
on the results of the 1991 survey, we would have drawn 
the conclusion that a signiﬁcant association between 
5-HTTLPR and anxiety-related traits 
is present, 
although the effect was in the other direction than 
expected. Therefore, not only different phenotypes 
should be measured, as suggested by Munafo et al. 
(2005b), but they should also be measured repeatedly. 
This also provides the opportunity to analyse mean 
scores over occasions, which is more powerful because 
of the high number of subjects and the reduction of 
measurement error. 
To summarize, this study analysed the association 
between 5-HTTLPR and self report measures of neu- 
roticism, anxiety and depression as well as DSM-IV 
depression in a large family based sample providing the 
opportunity to take population stratiﬁcation into 
account. The quantitative phenotypes were measured 
at ﬁve different occasions. No consistent association 
was found, not even after repeating the analyses in 



sub-samples to decrease the effects of the selection or of 
the relatively low age of the original sample. These 
results strongly suggest the absence of a straightforward 
association between 5-HTTLPR and neuroticism, anx- 
iety or depression.
