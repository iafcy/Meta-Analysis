Background: It has been reported that the functional polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR) 
modiﬁes the association between stressful life events (SLEs) and depression in child, adolescent, and adult populations. We sought to 
replicate this ﬁnding in elders and, additionally, to test modifying effects of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) val66met 
polymorphism. 
Methods: In 732 Korean community residents ages 65(cid:1), diagnosis of depression (Geriatric Mental State Schedule), information on SLEs, 
and genotypes for 5-HTTLPR and BDNF val66met were ascertained. Of those without depression at baseline, 521 (88%) were followed up 2.5 
years later. Interactions between SLEs and the two genotypes were investigated for both prevalent depression at baseline and incident 
depression at follow-up. 
Results: Signiﬁcant interactions of SLEs with both 5-HTTLPR and BDNF genotypes were observed on risk of depression after adjustment for 
age, gender, education, and disability. A signiﬁcant three-way interaction between 5-HTTLPR, BDNF, and SLEs was also found. The same 
ﬁndings were observed for predictors of incident depression in the prospective analysis. 
Conclusions: These ﬁndings suggest that environmental risk of depression is modiﬁed by at least two genes and that gene– environment 
interactions are found even into old age.

events (SLEs), and genetic predisposition are important in 
Many studies have highlighted the potential 
importance of 
gene– environment interactions. Individuals with family history 
of depression are recognized to be more vulnerable to the 
depressogenic effects of SLEs than those without (Phelan et al. 
1991; Pollit 1972). In a community study of female twins, the risk 
of major depression after SLEs was increased in those with 
greater genetic liability (Kendler et al. 1995). Recently, specific 
genes have been implicated. The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) 
gene has attracted particular attention. There is a biallelic 
polymorphism in the 5-HTT gene linked promoter region (5- 
HTTLPR) with short (s) and long (l ) alleles. The s allele reduces 
the transcriptional activity of the 5-HTT gene promoter resulting 
in decreased 5-HTT expression (Heils et al. 1995) and therefore 
has been hypothesized to be a risk factor for depression (Angue- 
lova et al. 2003). In the context of gene– environment interaction, 
individuals with the s allele of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism 
exhibited more depression and suicidality in relation to SLEs than

those with the l allele (Caspi et al. 2003). This finding has been 
replicated in child (Kaufman et al. 2004), adolescent (Eley et al. 
2004), and adult (Jacobs et al. 2006; Kendler et al. 2005; Taylor et 
al. 2006) populations. However, negative findings have also 
been reported (Gillespie et al. 2005; Surtees et al. 2006). This line 
of investigation has not been pursued in elders, although bio- 
psychosocial origins of late-life depression have been hypothe- 
sized to extend into late-life (Blazer and Hybels 2005) and a 
study of elders who had all been subject to a traumatic event (hip 
fracture) found associations between the 5-HTTLPR s allele and 
subsequent depression (Lenze et al. 2005). 
Another more recent candidate etiological gene for depres- 
sion is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene. This 
is located on chromosome 11p14.1 and has several polymorphic 
markers. These include the single nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) at nucleotide 196 (G/A), which results in an amino acid 
substitution (valine to methionine) at codon 66 (val66met, dbSNP 
number: rs6265) of the proBDNF molecule. This SNP affects 
intracellular processing and secretion of BDNF, and the met 
allele is associated with reduced BDNF activity (Egan et al. 2003). 
The met allele might confer increased vulnerability to depression 
after SLEs, but interactions between the two have not thus far 
been investigated. A three-way interaction between BDNF, 5- 
HTTLPR, and maltreatment was found to be associated with 
depression in children (Kaufman et al. 2006), but this has not 
been investigated in an adult population. 
With data from a community study of an older Korean 
population, we examined the roles of SLEs, 5-HTTLPR, and 
BDNF polymorphisms in association with depression. The 
objectives of this investigation were: 1) to replicate and extend 
to elders the findings from child and younger adult popula- 
tions that suggest modifying effects of 5-HTTLPR polymor- 
phism on the associations between SLEs and depression, and 
2) to test modifying effects of BDNF polymorphism on these 
associations.

This analysis was carried out on data from a prospective 
community-based study of late-life psychiatric morbidity carried 
out in Kwangju, South Korea from 2001 to 2003, in collaboration 
with the 10/66 International Research Program on Dementia in 
Developing Countries (Prince et al. 2003). All participants gave 
written formal informed consent at each examination. This study 
was approved by the Chonnam National University Hospital 
Institutional Review Board. 
Cross-sectional data were analyzed from a survey of a geo- 
graphically defined population carried out in 2001. The sampling 
procedure and measurements have been described previously 
(Kim et al. 2004a, 2004b). In brief, 732 community residents ages 
65 or over identified from national residents registration lists 
within two areas of Kwangju, South Korea were examined. 
Examinations included a fully structured diagnostic interview for 
depression; assessment of SLEs; blood samples for 5-HTTLPR 
and BDNF genotypes; and formal assessment of disability, 
cognitive function, and demographic characteristics. 
Depression was assessed with the community version of the 
Geriatric Mental State (GMS) diagnostic schedule (GMS B3) 
(Copeland et al. 1986). This 
is a fully structured diagnostic 
instrument 
in wide international use with an accompanying 
computerized algorithm. The GMS B3 was translated into Korean 
according to a formal standardization process (Kim et al. 2003). 
As in other studies, a “stage one” (non-hierarchical) confidence 
level of 3 or above in the Automated Geriatric Examination for 
Computer Assisted Taxonomy (AGECAT) algorithm was used to 
define depression of clinical significance (encompassing both 
severe and moderate depression). 
The instrument used in this study to ascertain SLEs was the 
List of Threatening Events (LTE) (Brugha et al. 1985), designed to 
detect events carrying significant long-term threat and of partic- 
ular salience for depression. Nine SLEs over the previous year are 
enquired about: serious illness (self), serious illness (close rela- 
tive), bereavement (immediate family), bereavement (other rel- 
ative or close friend), marital separation, end of relationship, 
problem with close friend or relative, and theft or loss. Positive 
responses were totaled to generate a summary scale and, be- 
cause of the skewed distribution, were divided into four groups 
(0, 1, 2, 3(cid:1)). The SLEs over the previous year were ascertained 
from interview with the participant and with their family infor- 
mants where possible (available for 41.7% of participants at 
baseline and 53.6% of those followed up). The validity of this 
instrument 
in aging adults has been previously established 
(Prince et al. 1997). 
For genotyping, DNA was extracted from venous blood with 
standard procedures. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the 
PCR-based restriction fragment 
length polymorphism assays 
were performed following previously published protocols with 
slight modification (Edenberg and Reynolds 1998; Proschel et al. 
1992). Briefly, for the 5-HTTLPR genotype, a PCR product was 
amplified with primers (5=-GGCGTTGCCGCTCTGAATGC-3=, 
5=-GAGGGACTGAGCTGGACAACCA-3=) 
flanking the region 
containing the gene variation. The PCR conditions consisted of a 
5-min denaturation step at 94°C, 40 cycles of 30-sec denaturation 
at 94°C, 30 sec annealing at 63°C, and 60 sec extension at 72°C, 
and a final 10-min extension step at 72°C. The PCR products 
were separated by electrophoresis in a 3% agarose gel stained 
with ethidium bromide and visualized by UV transillumination. 
The different genotypes were defined by the specific bands. For 

BDNF genotyping, the primer sequences used were the forward 
primer 5=-ACTCTGGAGAGCGTGAATGG-3= and the reverse 
primer 5=-ACTACTGAGCATCACCCTGGA-3=. The amplification 
conditions were pre-denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 
40 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 30 sec, 62°C for 
30 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec, and post-elongation at 72°C for 5 
min, with a final maintenance step at 4°C. The PCR products 
were digested at 37°C with the corresponding restriction enzyme 
(Eco72I), and gel electrophoresis was used to detect the 196G 
(val: 99 and 72 base pair [bp] fragments) and 196A (met: 171 bp 
fragment) alleles. The genotypes were categorized as “s/s,” “s/l,” 
and “l/l” for the 5-HTTLPR and as “val/val,” “val/met,” and 
“met/met” for the BDNF (Supplements 1 and 2). 
Disability was assessed by the Korean version of the World 
Schedule II 
Health Organization Disability Assessment 
(WHODAS 
function was 
II) (Kim et al. 2005). Cognitive 
evaluated by the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Exam- 
ination (MMSE) (Park and Kwon 1990). Demographic data on 
age, gender, and education were recorded. 
Further prospective analyses were carried out on a sub- 
sample of 521 participants without depression at baseline who 
were re-examined in 2003 (83% follow-up rate, mean (SD) 
follow-up period 2.4 (.3) years). The follow-up examination has 
been described in detail previously (Kim et al. 2006). In brief, 
depression was identified in an identical manner with the same 
instrument, and SLEs over the previous year were also re- 
assessed. 

Associations between SLE score, 5-HTTLPR, and BDNF geno- 
types and depression were measured initially by univariate 
analyses ((cid:2)2 tests) and then further analyzed with multivariable 
logistic regression models adjusted for disability, cognitive func- 
tion, and demographic characteristics. The main effects of SLEs 
and genotypes in these models were investigated (entering these 
as ordinal variables), together with all possible two- and three- 
way interactions between the two genotypes and SLE score. 
These procedures were repeated in the follow-up sample. Sta- 
tistical analyses were carried out with SPSS 12.0 software (SPSS, 
Chicago, Illinois). 

Of 732 participants at baseline, case-level depression was 
present in 101 (13.8%). Frequencies of SLEs and 5-HTTLPR/ 
BDNF genotypes in the sample are displayed in the first 
column of Table 1. These are compared between those with 
and without depression in the second through fifth columns of 
Table 1. Depression was significantly associated with 
in- 
creased numbers of SLEs. Although associations between 
depression and the two genotypes were in the directions 
anticipated, these were not significant. In addition (further 
data not shown), depression was significantly associated with 
worse disability (p (cid:3) .001), lower cognitive function (p (cid:4) 
.006), and female gender (p (cid:4) .004) but was not associated 
with age (p (cid:4) .095) or education (p (cid:4) .321). No deviation from 
the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was observed for either 
genotypes [(cid:2)2 (cid:4) 1.72 and .66 for 5-HTTLPR and BDNF 
genotypes in the total sample, respectively; all p (cid:5) .05]. 
Prevalence rates of depression by SLE score and genotypes 
are displayed 
in Figure 1. For the 5-HTTLPR genotypes, the 
association between SLE score and depression was significant in 
s/s homozygotes [(cid:2)2 (cid:4) 20.5, p (cid:3) .001] and s/l heterozygotes [(cid:2)2 (cid:4)

depression was significant in met/met homozygotes [(cid:2)2 (cid:4) 16.6,

not in val/val homozygotes [(cid:2)2 (cid:4) 3.68, p (cid:4) .055]. 
A logistic regression analysis was carried out to examine 
further the effects of main covariates and effect modification 
(interaction) for depression as the dependent variable. All factors 
were entered as ordinal variables with Wald statistics analyzed 
against 1 df. In a model adjusted for age, gender, education, 
cognitive function, and disability, the following factors were 
statistically significant: SLEs (Wald 17.2, p (cid:3) .001), SLEs (cid:6) 
5-HTTLPR (Wald 6.69, p (cid:4) .010), SLEs (cid:6) BDNF (Wald 16.1, p (cid:3) 
.001), and SLEs (cid:6) 5-HTTLPR (cid:6) BDNF (Wald 6.38, p (cid:4) .012). 
There were no significant effects of either gene alone (Wald 
statistics for 5-HTTLPR and BDNF: .78 [p (cid:4) .378] and .05 [p (cid:4) 
.822], respectively), and there was no significant gene (cid:6) gene 
effect modification (Wald .54, p (cid:4) .461). 
The three-way effect modification was positive, indicating 
greater than expected effect modification by each allele on the 
SLE-depression association if the other risk allele was present. 
For example, the prevalence rates of depression for people with 
3 or more life events and the BDNF met/met genotype were as 
follows: 0% for those with the 5-HTTLPR l/l genotype, 20.0% for 
those with the s/l genotype, and 70.0% for those with the s/s 
genotype. For people with the 5-HTTLPR s/s genotype and 3 or 
more life events, prevalence rates of depression were 22.2% and 
16.7%, respectively, for those with the BDNF val/val and val/met 
genotype. 

Of the 521 participants without baseline depression, “inci- 
dent” depression at 
in 63 (12.1%). 
Frequencies of SLEs and 5-HTTLPR/BDNF genotypes in the 
followed sample and associations with depression were near- 
identical to those in the baseline sample (data not shown). 
Incident depression was significantly associated with increased 
numbers of SLEs but not directly with the two genotypes.

val/val homozygotes [(cid:2)2 (cid:4) .01, p (cid:4) .967]. In a logistic regression 
model identical to that summarized earlier for prevalent depres- 
sion, 
the following factors were statistically significant: SLEs 
(Wald 8.68, p (cid:4) .03), SLEs (cid:6) BDNF (Wald 10.1, p (cid:4) .001), and 
SLEs (cid:6) 5-HTTLPR (cid:6) BDNF (Wald 3.88, p (cid:4) .049). The SLEs (cid:6) 
5-HTTLPR effect modification term was of borderline significance 
(Wald 3.13, p (cid:4) .077) in this model. 

The principal findings of this study of community elders were 
as follows: 1) previous findings of effect modification between 
5-HTTLPR genotype and SLEs on risk of depression were con- 
firmed; 2) similar effect modification between BDNF val66met 
genotype and SLEs on risk of depression was identified; and 
3) three-way effect modification between these two genotypes 
and SLEs on risk of depression was found. These findings were 
largely confirmed when the analysis was repeated in a follow-up 
study of participants without depression at baseline for the 
life 
association between depression at follow-up and recent 
events. 
To our knowledge, this study is the first to report on effect 
modification between SLEs and 5-HTTLPR genotype for late-life 
depression in a community population and the first to report on 
an interaction between BDNF genotype and SLEs in an adult 
population. Strengths of our study were that depression was 
ascertained with a widely validated diagnostic schedule and that 
information on a variety of important risk factors was obtained by 
standardized assessment instruments. The polymorphisms were 
assayed specifically for this analysis and were two of only five 
genetic assays carried out to date on this sample (the other three 
assays having been carried out for potential associations with 
dementia: apolipoprotein E, aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, and 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase). An important limitation 
was that the onset of depression in relation to SLE occurrence 
was not ascertained; so, the direction of causal relationships 
between the two cannot be assumed. However, the prospec- 
tive analysis of participants without depression at baseline 

confirmed the cross-sectional findings, providing support for 
the anticipated direction of causation, even though the precise 
timing of onset of depression could not be established within 
the follow-up period. 
With respect to the 5-HTTLPR genotype, our sample had 
higher s allele (70%) and lower l allele (30%) frequencies 
compared with reports from Western populations (Caspi et al. 
2003; Eley et al. 2004; Gillespie et al. 2005; Kendler et al. 2005) 
where the usual frequencies are 43%– 47% (approximately) for 
the s allele and 53%–57% (approximately) for the l allele. 
However, the findings are consistent with reports from Korean 
(Ha et al. 2005) and other East Asian populations (Kato et al. 
2005). Despite the ethnic differences 
in 5-HTTLPR genotype 
distribution, the findings from this study are very similar to 
previous results from different populations (Caspi et al. 2003; 
Eley et al. 2004; Kendler et al. 2005), in that the 5-HTTLPR 
polymorphism was not directly associated with depression but 
instead modified associations with SLEs. In a finding similar to 
previous studies, associations between SLEs and depression 
were most prominent in people with one or more copies of the 
s allele. 
A three-way interaction between BDNF genotype, 5-HTTLPR 
genotype, and maltreatment has been previously found with 
respect to depression in childhood (Kaufman 2006). Our novel 
finding of modifying effects of BDNF val66met polymorphism on 
the association between SLEs and depression (as well as the 
three-way effect modification) in an elderly sample requires 
replication but suggests that several genes might underlie the 
well-recognized familial vulnerability to environmental stressors. 
The BDNF system is a logical source of candidate genes for 
depression, because BDNF is the most abundant neurotrophin in 
the brain and has survival-promoting actions on a variety of 
central nervous system functions (Angelucci et al. 2005). The met 
allele is associated with reduced BDNF activity compared with 
the val allele (Egan et al. 2003). However, evidence for an 
association between the met allele and depression is inconclu- 
sive (Levinson 2006). Although the BDNF val66met polymor- 
it 
phism might not be directly associated with depression, 


might—like 5-HTTLPR—modify the association between envi- 
ronmental stress and depression. There has been accumulating 
evidence on potential relationships between stress and BDNF. 
Animal models have indicated reduction in hippocampal BDNF 
expression (Smith et al. 1995) and atrophy of hippocampal 
BDNF neurons in response to stress (Magarinos et al. 1996). 
Downregulation of BDNF has been hypothesized as an impor- 
tant mediating pathway (Elkis 1995). With respect to the BDNF 
genotype, our sample had higher met allele (47%) and lower val 
allele (53%) frequencies compared with reports from Western 
populations (Kaufman et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2006) where the 
usual frequencies are 17%–21% (approximately) for the met 
allele and 78%– 87% (approximately) for the val allele. However, 
the findings are similar to reports from other Asian populations 
(Kunugi et al. 2004). 
There is evidence that the serotonin and BDNF systems might 
be linked at multiple intracellular and intercellular levels (Duman 
et al. 1997). For example, stress has been found to be associated 
with reductions in both Raphe serotonin transporter messenger 
RNA (mRNA) and hippocampal BDNF mRNA (Vollmayr et al. 
2000). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor knockout mice have 
also been found to have brain serotonergic abnormalities (Lyons 
et al. 1999). A recent study of maltreated children found that 
those with the met allele of the BDNF gene and two short alleles 
of 5-HTTLPR had the highest depression scores (Kaufman et al. 
2006). No direct interaction between the two genes was observed 
in the study presented here. However, gene– gene interactions, 
like direct gene effects, might only be observable in the presence 
of environmental stressors, and the significant three-way effect 
modification provides some evidence of this. Further research is 
required to confirm this association in other adult and elderly 
populations. 
Previous studies of gene– environment interactions have fo- 
cused on child or adolescent populations (Caspi et al. 2003; Eley 
et al. 2004; Kaufman et al. 2004). In adults, some studies have 
found significant associations (Jacobs et al. 2006; Kendler et al. 
2005; Taylor et al. 2006), whereas other have not (Gillespie et al. 
2005; Surtees et al. 2006). The negative findings from the large 
British EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer) 
population study reported by Surtees et al. (2006) are particularly 
important, because one of the suggestions for the failure to 
replicate the gene– environment interaction observed by Caspi et 
al. was that the EPIC sample was relatively old (ages 41– 80 
years). Our findings, in contrast, suggest that interactions be- 
tween genetic predisposition and environmental stressors are 
still observable in old age. An important difference between our 
study and the EPIC study was in the method used to ascertain 
depression. 
In the EPIC study, restrictive major depression 
criteria were applied, whereas in our study a less restrictive 
category of depression was used, encompassing both moderate 
and severe levels of symptoms. Also, a fully structured diagnostic 
interview was used in our study specifically developed for 
ascertaining depression in elderly populations in whom DSM 
major depression criteria might not adequately characterize 
clinically relevant depressive syndromes. Comparing our results 
with those from the EPIC study, we found that prevalence rates 
of depression were higher in our study, which reflect the broader 
definition applied. Therefore it is possible that gene– environ- 
ment interactions in older populations are more clearly observed 
with less restrictive criteria (i.e., they might apply to depressive 
syndromes that are not adequately measured by criteria developed 
for younger adult populations). The same reasons might underlie 
the difference between our findings and those of Gillespie et al. 
(2005), because DSM-IV criteria were also used in that study. The 
nature of the samples might also be relevant, because ours was an 
unselected community population compared with the twin-pair 
volunteer sample analyzed in the other study. 
Other features of our study might also underlie the positive 
findings. Both risk genotypes (5-HTTLPR s/s and BDNF met/met) 
were relatively common in our sample (as with other East Asian 
populations), which will have increased the statistical power to 
detect associations. If the three-way gene– gene– environment 
effect modification is confirmed in other samples, then the effect 
of each risk genotype will have been increased by the relatively 
high frequency of the other modifying allele in our sample. It is 
also possible that other risk alleles have higher population 
prevalence rates, increasing the chances of detectable associa- 
tions. Background environmental risk might also be raised. As 
can be seen from Table 1, adverse life events were commonly 
reported by participants with only just over one-quarter reporting 
no recent stressors. The strength of association between SLEs and 
depression was strong for both cross-sectional and prospective 
analyses (and consistent with that reported repeatedly from other 
research), which does not suggest that minor stressors were 
over-reported. Therefore it is possible that our positive findings 
are the product of a population with particularly high levels of 
genetic and environmental risk. The high prevalence rates of the 
5-HTTLPR s allele and the BDNF met allele might have public 
health relevance in East Asian populations because of their high 
prevalence, but this requires further evaluation. 
Although a view has traditionally been held that familial 
factors become less important in the etiology of depression in 
late life, genetic determinants of depression seem relatively 
stable across the lifespan (Gillespie et al. 2004). A recent study 
reported that there was no evidence for differences in the roles of 
genetic and environmental risk factors for major depression in 
birth cohorts spanning nearly 6 decades (Kendler et al. 2006). 
Life events, particularly bereavement, social isolation, physical 
illness, and economic loss, are considered to be important risk 
factors for late-life depression (Alexopoulos 2005). A biopsycho- 
social approach to evaluating the origins of late-life depression is 
heuristically valuable.
