We report results from the PREDICT-Gene case-control study nested in a prospective cohort 
designed to identify predictors of the onset of depression among adult primary-care attendees. 
We tested the potential gene-by-environment interaction between 5HTTLPR genotype at the 
serotonin transporter gene and previous exposure to threatening life events (TLEs) in 
depression. A total of 737 consecutively recruited participants were genotyped. Additional 
information was gathered on exposure to TLEs over a 6-month period, socio-demographic 
data and family history of psychological problems among first-degree relatives. Diagnoses of 
depression were ascertained using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) by 
trained interviewers. Two different depressive outcomes were used (ICD-10 depressive 
episode and ICD-10 severe depressive episode). Both the s/s genotype and exposure to 
increasing number of TLEs were significantly associated with depression. Moreover, the 
5HTTLPR s/s genotype significantly modified the risk conferred by TLEs for both depressive 
outcomes. Thus, s/s homozygous participants required minimal exposure to TLE (1 TLE) to 
acquire a level of risk for depression that was only found among l/s or l/l individuals after 
significantly higher exposure to TLEs (two or more TLEs). The interaction was more apparent 
when applied to the diagnosis of ICD-10 severe depressive episode and after adjusting for 
gender, age and family history of psychological problems. Likelihood ratios tests for the 
interaction were statistically significant for both depressive outcomes (ICD-10 depressive 
episode: LR X2 = 4.7, P = 0.09 (crude), LR-X2 = 6.4, P = 0.04 (adjusted); ICD-10 severe depressive 
episode: LR X2 = 6.9, P = 0.032 (crude), LR-X2 = 8.1, P = 0.017 (adjusted)).

be identified but, undoubtedly, comprise both genetic 
and environmental components. One of the environ- 
mental risk factors consistently linked to depression is 
life events.1–4 From the

(SLC6A4) 
that plays a key role in serotonergic 
neurotransmission is a candidate gene for depression. 
Moreover, its protein product is the central target for 
most antidepressant drugs. One of the polymorphisms 
described in the gene, the 5-HTTLPR, consists of an 
insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter 
region. Its short variant (s allele) reduces the transcrip- 
tional efficiency of the gene, resulting in decreased 
serotonin transporter expression in the neuron.5 Some 
association studies have reported an increased risk for 
depression among s/s genotype carriers,6–10 although 
others have reported negative results.11–13 
The interplay between genetic and environmental 
factors in the aetiology of common and complex 
diseases has been well recognized,14 but the techno- 
logy required to explore this relationship has only 
become available recently. Research on gene-by- 
environment interactions can improve our under- 
standing of the aetiology of complex diseases, such as 
mental disorders by providing a more accurate 
estimation of population-attributable risks for genetic 
and environmental risk factors. Such research can 
also contribute to the design of preventative and 
therapeutic interventions for depression.15 Over the 
past 3 years, the interaction between the 5HTTLPR 
polymorphism and exposure to stressful life events 
has been under scrutiny. Animal research has shown 
a greater 
likelihood of depressive outcomes in 
macaques subjected to adverse rearing experiences 
who carry the risk allele of the rh5HTTLPR poly- 
morphism.16 Moreover, imaging studies on humans 
have demonstrated amygdala hyperreactivity in re- 
sponse to fearful stimuli among s allele carriers 
compared to l/l individuals.17 
Longitudinal data on people with one or two s 
alleles at the 5HTTLPR locus indicate that they are 
more vulnerable to depression than non-s allele 
carriers for the same level of exposure to stressful life 
situations.12 Moreover, variations at the same locus 
modify the risk effect of developing depression in 
those maltreated in childhood.12 These findings 
have been more recently replicated18–23 to include: a 
population-based adult twin study in which people 
with the s/s genotype were more vulnerable to the 
depressogenic effects of exposure to stressful life 
events;21 research on 101 children in whom the s/s 
genotype at the 5HTTLPR locus made them more 
susceptible to depression when they had experienced 
maltreatment and/or lack of social support20 and a 
longitudinal follow-up of 127 people over 25 years in 
whom the s/s genotype was found to modify the effect 
of previous exposure to adverse life events as a risk 
factor for first onset of depression.23 
Some research has been conducted exclusively in 
women. Eley et al.18 compared 377 adolescents girls 
categorized by scores on the self-reported short form 
of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, and found 
that the risk of social environmental factors was 
higher among carriers of short (s) alleles. Sjo¨berg et 
al.22 reported similar findings in female adolescents, 
but showed the opposite effects in male adolescents 
(i.e., male s allele carriers were less likely to develop 
depression after being exposed to risky environmental 
factors). There have also been two larger studies that 
have failed to replicate the gene (cid:1) environment inter- 
action. The first study was conducted on an adult 
cohort of 1206 twins,24 and the other was a 1-year 
follow-up of 4175 people.25 
Overall, the strongest evidence is in favour of the 
effect of an interaction between 5HTTLPR and social 
distress.26 However, to date research has been limited 
by selective sample studies (i.e., children, adolescents 
or twins) and the use of non-standard depressive 
outcomes. There is, hence, an urgent need to replicate 
these findings in large representative adult popula-

tions on whom validated measures of depression 
have been used. The PREDICT-Gene study tests the 
hypothesis 
the 
5HTTLPR locus interacts with social adversity (ex- 
posure to stressful life events), modifying the risk for 
depression in a Spanish population of primary-care 
attendees. 


Design 
The PREDICT-Gene study9 is a case-control associa- 
tion study nested in a cohort of Spanish participants 
who were part of a larger study on prediction of onset 
of depression in European primary-care attendees 
(PREDICT study). A detailed description of 
the 
PREDICT study design and its method has been 
reported elsewhere.27 In brief, the PREDICT study is 
a 1-year prospective study assessing consecutive 
general practice attendees at 0 (time-1), 6 (time-2) 
and 12 months (time-3). Only cross-sectional (time-1) 
data are used in this analysis. Both PREDICT and the 
PREDICT-Gene studies were approved by the relevant 
research ethics committees. 
Sample 
Consecutive attendees to nine (two rural and seven 
urban) primary care centres in the area of Ma´laga 
(Spain), aged 18–75, were asked to participate 
between April 2003 and September 2004. The 
participant’s family doctor asked his/her patient to 
take part, and time-1 interviews were undertaken by 
three trained researchers within 2 weeks of informed 
consent being provided. Attendees over 75 were 
excluded because of higher prevalence of cognitive 
impairment after that age. Participants unable to 
understand Spanish, as well as those with an organic 
mental disorder and/or any terminal illness, were 
also excluded. This genetic study was not a part of 
the original PREDICT study protocol, that aimed to 
construct a predictive model of depression for use 
by general practitioners. Consequently, at 
time-3, 
further informed consent was requested to obtain a 
biological sample for genetic analysis consisting of 
10 cm3 of blood and/or up to 4-mouth swabs for saliva 
collection. 
Independent measures 
The PREDICT risk factor assessment was shown to 
have adequate test–retest reliability.27 In brief, the risk 
factors for depression were either based on previously 
validated measures, concerned exposures (such as 
socio-demographic data) that are likely to be reported 
with a high degree of reliability, or (where new 
questions were developed, e.g., 
family history of 
psychological problems and living arrangements) 
were subjected to reliability testing at the outset of 
the study. 
Social distress was measured using the List of 
Threatening Events.28 This is a list including serious 
events shown to carry high degrees of contextual 


Depression and 5-HTTLPR genotype 
JA Cervilla et al 
threat. The list includes serious life–events, such as 
the death of a parent, spouse or child, the death of 
another relative, the onset of a serious illness or 
accident affecting a relative, a marital separation, the 
ending of a friendship or relationship, a serious 
problem with a close friend, neighbour or relative, a 
financial crisis, the theft or loss of an item of personal 
value, having troubles with the police or courts, loss 
of work through redundancy and loss of work through 
dismissal. Subjects were asked whether any of these 
events had occurred within the 6 months before the 
interview. For the purposes of 
the analysis, we 
divided participants into three levels of exposure to 
threatening life events (TLEs): Having had no TLE, 
having had just one TLE or having had two or more 
TLEs, over the 6-month period before the interview. 
5HTTLPR genotype assays 
DNA from both blood and saliva was obtained by 
standard procedures. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism 
at SLC6A4 was genotyped in all samples. Amplifi- 
cation of genomic DNA was performed using 50 ng 
of DNA, 0.25 mM of each primer (forward: 50-GGCGTT 
GCCGCT CTG AAT GCC-30 and reverse: 50-CAGGGG 
AGATCC TGG GAG AGG T-30), 250 mM each of dATP, 
dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 
10 mM Tris-HCl and 0.3 units of DNA polymerase in a 
total volume of 25 ml. Samples were amplified for an 
initial cycle of 8 min at 951C followed by 35 cycles 
each consisting of 30 s at 951C, 30 s at 621C and 1 min 
at 721C. After amplification, genotypes were resolved 
by a 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium 
bromide staining. 
Measures of depression 
Six months prevalence of ICD-10 depressive episode 
(mild, moderate or severe) was ascertained using the 
depression section of the Composite International 
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).29 The CIDI was adminis- 
tered by trained lay interviewers. We tested our 
hypothesis by performing two sets of analyses. In 
the first, we used ICD-1030 depressive episode of any 
severity as our depression outcome, and in the second 
we repeated the analyses only in those with an ICD-10 
depressive episode of severe intensity. 
Data quality control 
Data quality was monitored to ensure that the project 
yielded data of the highest validity and reliability. 
The Spanish version of the PREDICT protocol was 
translated from English and then back translated by 
professional translators before the coordinating centre 
in London finally verified no major discrepancy in 
any back-translation. At a local level, each interview 
was checked for completion by each interviewer, all 
of whom had previously undergone a standardized 
training on administering the CIDI and the risk factor 
questionnaire, recruitment and interviewing of pa- 
tients and data management. A Spanish research 
coordinator made two assessments of each inter- 
viewer during the time-1 baseline interviews to 
monitor the adequacy of the interview and tackle 
any problems as they arose. Before transferring data to 
the coordinating centre, data quality control sheets 
were used and progress reports were submitted every 
6 months to allow critical assessment by the PREDICT 
study steering group during regular project manage- 
ment meetings. Ten per cent of data were double 
entered which revealed an error rate of only 0.13%. 
Statistical analyses 
The data were analysed using the STATA 9.0 
statistical package.31 An initial exploratory analysis 
was performed to study the distribution of both 
independent and dependent variables. Univariable 
associations were explored, using parametric or non- 
parametric significance tests as appropriate. Bivari- 
able risks were estimated using classical stratified 
analysis. Using a multivariable logistic regression 
analysis, odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals 
for depression were calculated across 5HTLPPR 
genotype categories (s/s vs l/s and/or l/l) and also 
across the three levels of exposure to previous TLE. 
Finally, using a logistic regression model, we tested 
the interaction between the genetic (5HTTLPR geno- 
(exposure to TLEs) 
type) and the environmental 
factors, both crudely and then after adjustment for 
sex, age and family history of psychological problems 
among first-degree relatives. We calculated probabil- 
ities for depression across all combinations of levels 
of exposure to TLE by 5HTTLPR genotype (s/s vs l/s 
or l/l). Crude and adjusted probabilities for depres- 
sion across strata were also calculated. Finally, like- 
lihood ratios tests for both differences of probabilities 
between such strata and for the genetic by environ- 
ment interaction were also estimated. 

The sample 
A total of 737 (80%) out of 922 participants at time-3 
gave informed consent to be included in the PRE- 
DICT-Gene genetic study and provided a biological 
sample for genetic testing (n = 737). The sample’s 
mean age was 49 years (s.d. = 15.2). Five hundred and 
twenty-nine participants were women (71.8%) and 
208 were men (21.2%). Most participants were 
married or living with a partner (71%), had primary 
(60%) or secondary (33.6%) schooling as their highest 
educational level and were working either in (30%) or 
away (30.3%) from home, whereas 15.9% were retired 
and 5.2% were unemployed. 36.6% of the sample had 
a positive family history of any psychological dis- 
order amongst at 
least one first-degree relative. 
Participants who agreed to take part in the genetic 
analysis did not vary systematically, in terms of sex 
(female gender: 74 vs 71%, X2 = 0.47, P = 0.49), mean 
age (49.18 vs 50 years, Student’s t = 0.87, P = 0.38), 
marital status (unmarried 33 vs 29%, X2 = 4.37, 
P = 0.49) or prevalence of ICD-10 depressive episode 
(35.4 vs 34.7%, X2 = 0.021, P = 0.88), from those who 
refused to give a genetic sample. Nor were there any 

significant differences on these variables between 
participants in the genetic study and those who 
participated in the initial baseline assessments (mean 
age 49.18 vs 49.02 years, Student’s t = 0.18, P = 0.85; 
female gender 74 vs 71.8%, X2 = 1.59, P = 0.020; being 
unmarried 33 vs 31%, X2 = 4.37, P = 0.49; prevalence 
of 
ICD-10 depressive episode (35.4 vs 33.4%, 
X2 = 0.72, P = 0.39). 
Independent variables frequencies 
Demographic, genotypic and phenotypic data on the 
sample are provided in Table 1. Summarizing, one in 
four participants had not experienced any TLE in the 
previous 6 months, and of the rest, about half had 
reported at least one TLE and the other half at least 
two or more TLEs. Just over a half of participants had 
the l allele, whereas the rest had the s allele. 
Approximately half 
the participants had the s/l 
genotype, a quarter had the l/l genotype and the 
remaining quarter had the s/s genotype (see Table 1 
for details). Genotype frequencies were in Hardy– 
Weinberg equilibrium, both in cases and controls. 
Associations with depression 
The 6-month prevalence of an ICD-10 depressive 
episode was 35.4% (262) and that of ICD-10 severe 
depressive episode was 25.4% (183) (see Table 1). 
Table 2 shows that depression was associated with 
the 5HTTLPR s/s genotype, as reported in detail 
elsewhere.9 In brief, the association between the s/s 
genotype and depression was independent of age, sex, 
family history of psychological problems among first- 
degree relatives and GAD, but these associations were 
stronger for more severe depressive episodes. Both 
outcomes of depression were strongly and indepen- 
dently associated with previous exposure to TLE with 
initial crude associations remaining robust after 
adjusting for age, gender, marital status, education 
and family history of psychological problems (Table 
2). Conversely, depression was not associated with 
marital status, professional situation, living arrange- 
ment or educational level in this sample. 
5HTTLPR genotype interaction with threatening life 
experiences 
The 5HTTLPR polymorphism significantly modified 
the risk effect for depression conferred by an increas- 
ing level of exposure to TLE (Table 3 and Figure 1). 
The interaction reached a higher level of significance 
when the TLE effect on depression in s/s genotype 
carriers was compared with the other two genotypes 
combined (l/l or l/s) (Table 3) and when only severe 
depression was considered. On adjustment, age did 
not modify the results and was hence excluded from 
the explanatory models. Finally, the interaction was 
stronger for both depressive outcomes after adjusting 
for gender, age and family history of psychological 
problems amongst first-degree relatives (Table 3 and 
Figure 1).

Summary of results 
Our main findings are that the 5HTTLPR s/s genotype 
and exposure to increasing numbers of TLEs were 
independently associated with depression, and that

the 5HTTLPR s/s genotype significantly modified the 
risk conferred by TLEs for both depressive outcomes. 
Thus, s/s homozygous participants required minimal 
exposure to TLE (1 TLE) to acquire a level of risk for 
depression, whereas l/s or l/l individuals required 
higher exposure to two or more TLEs. This interaction 
was more apparent 
for people with an ICD-10 
diagnosis of severe depression and after adjustment 
for gender, age and family history of psychological 
problems. 
Study design and limitations 
A case-control study nested in a cohort study with 
retrospective environmental and genetic data is an 
appropriate design to examine the gene–environment 
interaction hypothesis15 However, such studies may 
be limited by selection, recall and/or survivor bias. In 
this study, these biases were minimized by sampling a 
representative population of general practice atten- 
dees. In addition, no significant differences were 
found on socio-demographic factors, and the level of 
depression between the participants included in our 
genetic analyses with those who refused a genetic 
specimen or were lost to follow-up at time-3.9 We did 
not use the newly reported 5HTTLPR reclassification 
procedure by additionally genotypying the sample 
for the so-called A/G variant,32 which may imply a 
potential limitation to this study. However, some 
authors have posed that reclassification of subjects 
using such new polymorphism seem to render 
comparable results to the well-established method 
used by us.33 
Novelty and interest 
We aimed to replicate previous findings in which 
variation at the 5HTTLPR locus modified the risk 
effect for depression conferred by previous exposure 
to stressful life events.12,18–23 It was important to do 
this as although, the earliest report on the gene– 
environment interaction was conducted on an adult 
sample,12 most of the other studies were restricted to 
populations, such as women but not men,18,19,22 
younger people,18,20,22 twins21 or people with affective 
disorders.34 Our study used consecutive primary-care 
adult attendees and hence constitutes the first 
the 
representative population-based replication of 
earliest research. To our knowledge, it is also the first 
study to examine genetic-environment interaction in 
a homogeneous Spanish population in whom geno- 
type frequencies7,10 and prevalences of exposure to 
TLEs3,28 were similar to most other European popula- 
tions. Lastly, it is the first study to take account of 
potential confounders, such as age, gender and family 
history of psychological problems among first-degree 
relatives.

Depression and 5-HTTLPR genotype 
JA Cervilla et al 
in arriving at a diagnose of a depressive episode. 
Consequently, we performed parallel tests using both 
a broader depressive phenotype (i.e., ICD-10 depres- 
sive episode of any severity) and a narrower pheno- 
type (i.e., only ICD-10 severe depressive episode). The 
results for the gene–environment interaction are more 
apparent when using the latter construct. This may 
indicate that ICD-10 severe depressive episode is a 
more specific depressive phenotype. 
It may also 
suggest that there could be a linear tendency for the 
reported gene–environment interaction to influence 
increasingly more intense depressive states. The 
definition of the depressive phenotype is crucial in 
tests of the gene–environment interactions and has 
been one of the major limitations of previous research 
on this topic.18,22,24,25 
The gene–environment interaction 
Both crude and adjusted gene–environment interac- 
tions, on both depressive outcomes, show a non- 
linear effect of 
the risk conferred by TLEs for 
depression as a function of the 5HTTLPR genotype. 
Hence, among s/s individuals minimal 
levels of 
exposure to TLEs (from one onwards) confer a degree 
of risk for depression that is only reached by non-s/s 
individuals who have had higher levels of exposure 
(two or more). Thus, our results show an interaction 
follows a step-wise pattern with an abrupt 
that 
change, when comparing genotypes, at moderate 
levels (1 TLE) of exposure to TLEs (see Figure 1). 
We believe this may be partially owing to the intense 
threatening nature of the stressful life-events mea- 
sured by the scale we used, where only seriously 
threatening stressful life events are recorded.28 Caspi 
et al.12 reported an interaction of 5HTTLPR genotype 
with a linear progression of exposure to life events, 
possibly because their measure of stressful life-events 
included a wide range of situations, including those 
with a lower severity and contextual threat than those 
used in our measure.35 Our results are most similar to 
Kendler et al.21 and Wilheim et al.,23 who demonstrated 
a step-wise pattern for the interaction according to the 





























Depression and 5-HTTLPR genotype 
JA Cervilla et al 
level of threat conveyed by the stressful experiences. 
Although two independent, large studies have failed to 
replicate previous reports of 
this particular gene– 
environment interaction,24,25 their definitions of the 
depressive phenotypes examined may explain their 
findings. The study with the largest sample25 used a 
self-report, potentially non-specific measure of both 
depression and life events. Moreover, the study was 
not designed to measure risk factors for depression, but 
was based on a cohort developed to investigate cancer 
and nutritional problems. The second study was also 
based on a self-report instrument for depression in a 
study of alcoholism that was adapted to identify cases 
of DSM-IV depression.24 On the whole, our indepen- 
dent findings add to other positive studies that support 
the notion of a true 5HTTLPR by stressful life-events 
interaction first reported by Caspi et al.12 and repli- 
cated by others.18–23,34 



Accounting for gender, age and family history 
Our results show a somewhat better model fit after 
adjustment for potential confounders, such as gender 
and family history. Age had little impact. The 
relationship between gender and this particular 
gene–environment interaction is puzzling as some 
studies have 
both 
sexes,20,21,23,34 whereas others suggest an effect only 
in women18,19 or even an inverse effect in men.22 We 
found no statistically significant differences in the 
reported gene–environment interaction when women 
were compared to men. Family history of psycholo- 
gical problems has been associated with both ex- 
posure36 and outcome,37 and thus should remain in 
the model. The independence from family history of 
our reported gene–environment interaction may sug- 
gest that there could be some specific role for the 
5HTTLPR genotype (or the serotonin transporter 
for 
gene) 
depression conferred by previous TLEs. Nevertheless, 
there is a report for a different candidate gene for 
depression also interacting with stressful life experi- 
ences, although the sample studied was one of 
affective disorders sufferers with no controls.34 


In conclusion, our findings add further evidence, 
from a case-control study nested in a Spanish cohort 
of adult primary-care attendees, in favour of an effect 
modification by the 5HTTLPR genotype on the risk of 
depression conferred by previous exposure to stress- 
ful life-events.
