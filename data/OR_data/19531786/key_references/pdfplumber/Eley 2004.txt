We report analyses from a study of gene–environment interaction in adolescent depression.
The sample was selected from 1990 adolescents aged 10–20 years: those with depression
symptomsinthetoporbottom15%wereidentifiedanddividedintohighorlowenvironmental
riskgroups.DNAwasobtainedfrom377adolescents,representingthefourquadrantsofhigh

serotonergicgenes5HTT,HTR2A,HTR2C,MAOA(monoamineoxidasetypeA)andtryptophan
hydroxylase (TPH) were genotyped. Environmental risk group was a nonsignificant predictor
and sex was a significant predictor of the depression group. HTR2A and TPH significantly
predicted the depression group, independent of the effects of sex, environmental risk group
and their interaction. In addition, there was a trend for an effect of 5HTTLPR, which was
significant in female subjects. Furthermore, there was a significant genotype–environmental
risk interaction for 5HTTLPR in female subjects only, with the effect being in the same
direction as another recent study, reaffirming that an important source of genetic
