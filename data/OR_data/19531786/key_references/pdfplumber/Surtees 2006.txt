Methods: Data were available from a non-clinical sample of 4175 adult men and women, ages 41–80 years, selected from
participantsintheEuropeanProspectiveInvestigationintoCancerandNutritioninNorfolk(EPIC-Norfolk,UnitedKingdom)study.
Evidence of past-year prevalent episodic major depressive disorder (MDD), defined by restricted DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, was
assessedthroughquestionnaire.Adverseexperiencesinchildhoodandinadulthood(duringthefiveyearsprecedingassessment)were
alsoassessedthroughself-report.The5-HTTLPRvariantwasgenotypedaccordingtopublishedprotocols.
Results:One-yearprevalentMDDcriteriaweremetby298studyparticipants.Theexperienceofsocialadversity(bothinchildhood
