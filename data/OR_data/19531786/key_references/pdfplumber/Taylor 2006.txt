Background:Mixedevidencehassuggestedthathomozygouscarriersoftheshortallele(s/s)oftheserotonintransportergene-linked
polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) may be at increased risk for depression, if they have also been exposed to early or current

Methods: A nonclinical sample of 118 young adult men and women completed assessments of early family environment, recent
stressfulevents,psychosocialresources,andpsychologicaldistress,includingdepressivesymptomatology.The5-HTTLPRwasgenotyped

Results: A stressful early family environment was significantly related to depressive symptomatology. In addition, gene-by-

Conclusions: Early or current environment, in conjunction with the serotonin transporter polymorphism, predicts depressive

naire. This questionnaire (Taylor et al 2004) was adapted from an
instrument originally developed by Felitti et al (1998) to assess
the relation of family stress to mental and physical health
outcomes in adulthood. In previous research, we validated this
questionnaire against clinical interviews conducted and coded
bytrainedclinicalinterviewers;thedualassessments(question-

(Taylor et al 2004).1 The scale has been reliably tied to adverse
