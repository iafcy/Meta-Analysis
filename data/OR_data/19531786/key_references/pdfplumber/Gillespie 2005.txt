ABSTRACT
Background. Serotonin is a good candidate for major depression. We attempted to replicate the
studybyCaspiandcolleagues[Science(2003)301,386–389]whichreportedasignificantinteraction
between serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) genotype and stressful life events when predicting
majordepression.
Method. We typed the serotonin promoter 5-HTTLPR gene in 1206 male and female twins aged
19–78years(mean=39,S.D.=11).ADSM-IVdiagnosisofmajordepressionwasavailablefor1199
twins. Most of these twins had participated in a 1988–1990 study which included a stressful life

Results. There were significant main effects for stressful life events but there was no evidence for
anyeffectof5-HTTgenotype,noragenotyperstressfullifeeventinteraction.
Conclusions. Regardlessofwhetherourresultswerebasedonbinarylogisticorordinalregression
analyses we found no evidence to support a main effect of 5-HTTLPR, or an interaction between
the 5-HTTLPR genotype and stressful life events on major depression. Only 20% of our subjects
