We report results from the PREDICT-Gene case-control study nested in a prospective cohort
designedtoidentifypredictorsoftheonsetofdepressionamongadultprimary-careattendees.
We tested the potential gene-by-environment interaction between 5HTTLPR genotype at the
serotonin transporter gene and previous exposure to threatening life events (TLEs) in
depression. A total of 737 consecutively recruited participants were genotyped. Additional
information was gathered on exposure to TLEs over a 6-month period, socio-demographic
dataandfamilyhistoryofpsychologicalproblemsamongfirst-degreerelatives.Diagnosesof
depressionwereascertainedusingtheCompositeInternationalDiagnosticInterview(CIDI)by
trained interviewers. Two different depressive outcomes were used (ICD-10 depressive
episode and ICD-10 severe depressive episode). Both the s/s genotype and exposure to
increasing number of TLEs were significantly associated with depression. Moreover, the
5HTTLPR s/s genotype significantly modified the risk conferred by TLEs for both depressive
outcomes. Thus, s/s homozygous participants required minimal exposure to TLE (1 TLE) to
acquire a level of risk for depression that was only found among l/s or l/l individuals after
significantlyhigherexposuretoTLEs(twoormoreTLEs).Theinteractionwasmoreapparent

gender, age and family history of psychological problems. Likelihood ratios tests for the
interaction were statistically significant for both depressive outcomes (ICD-10 depressive
