Previous studies have yielded conflicting results as to the putative role of the functional
polymorphism of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) in the
etiology of anxiety-related traits and depressive disorders. Recently, a significant gene–
environment interaction was found between life stressors, the short allele of the SLC6A4

environment interaction could be replicated within a different population with a different risk
structure. A total of 1005 subjects from a general population sample (Study of Health in
Pomerania) were genotyped. Mental and physical distress were assessed on 38 items of the
modified complaint scale (BL-38). The interaction between the SLC6A4 genotype, social
stressorsandchronicdiseaseswithregardtotheBL-38scorewasevaluatedbyANOVA.There
was no independent association of genotype with mental and physical distress. However,

finding is sustained by the fact that the sample characteristics and the risk structure were
highlydifferent fromprevious studies.
