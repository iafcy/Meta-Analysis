Abstract
Previous research examining gene–environment interaction (GrE) with regard to vulnerability to
depressionandanxietyhasyieldedconflictingresults.Thepresentstudywasdesignedtofurtherinves-

genotypiccharacterizationsaswellasdifferenttypesofadversitywithinaprospectivestudydesign.Data
wereavailablefromanongoingepidemiologicalcohortstudyfollowingtheoutcomeofearlyriskfactors
from birth to adulthood. At age 19yr, 309 participants (142 males, 167 females) were characterized
on measures of depression and anxiety through interview and questionnaire (DSM-IV diagnosis,
Beck Depression Inventory, Harm Avoidance). Environmental adversity was assessed at birth (family
adversity),andatage19yr(stressfullifeevents).Bi-andtri-allelic5-HTTLPRgenotypeswereobtained
fromgenomicDNA.Resultsindicatedthatdepressionandanxietyin19-yr-oldswerestronglyassociated
withbothfamilyadversityandstressfullifeevents.IndividualswiththeLLgenotypeof5-HTTLPRwho
were exposed to high family adversity displayed significantly higher rates of depressive or anxiety
