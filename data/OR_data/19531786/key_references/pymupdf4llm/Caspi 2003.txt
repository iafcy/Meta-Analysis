right ACC during visuospatial decisions, projected on the same rendered brain as in Fig. 1.
Right ACC significantly

parts of the right IPS
(42/–42/44, _t max_ �

reduced to P � 0.05, uncorrected, no other significant clusters were found throughout the brain.
(B) This schema summarizes the negative findings for right ACC: As indicated by the gray dashed
lines, right ACC shows no context-dependent contributions to any left-hemispheric area during
visuospatial decisions and none to any left- or right-hemispheric area at all during letter decisions.


tivity (25) that investigated two tasks with right
hemisphere dominance demonstrated top-down
effects that were specific for the right hemisphere, i.e., from the right middle frontal gyrus
(area 46) on right extrastriate areas. It is thus
likely that our findings generalize to other lateralized tasks. Although we cannot exclude lateralization contingent on stimulus type in some
situations, our results are consistent with previous findings from split-brain patient studies (7)
and positron emission tomography (11) showing
hemispheric specialization based on task demands. Research on hemispheric specialization
should move beyond analyses of asymmetric
regional activations and focus more strongly on
functional interactions within and between
hemispheres.

# Influence of Life Stress on Depression: Moderation by a Polymorphism in the 5-HTT Gene

In a prospective-longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort, we tested
why stressful experiences lead to depression in some people but not in others.
A functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter
(5-HTT) gene was found to moderate the influence of stressful life events on
depression. Individuals with one or two copies of the short allele of the 5-HTT
promoter polymorphism exhibited more depressive symptoms, diagnosable
depression, and suicidality in relation to stressful life events than individuals
homozygous for the long allele. This epidemiological study thus provides evidence of a gene-by-environment interaction, in which an individual’s response
to environmental insults is moderated by his or her genetic makeup.


Depression is among the top five leading causes
of disability and disease burden throughout the
world (1). Across the life span, stressful life
events that involve threat, loss, humiliation, or
defeat influence the onset and course of depres

sion (2–5). However, not all people who encounter a stressful life experience succumb to
its depressogenic effect. Diathesis-stress theories of depression predict that individuals’ sensitivity to stressful events depends on their genetic makeup (6, 7). Behavioral genetics research supports this prediction, documenting
that the risk of depression after a stressful event
is elevated among people who are at high genetic risk and diminished among those at low
genetic risk (8). However, whether specific
genes exacerbate or buffer the effect of stressful
life events on depression is unknown. In this

moter region of the serotonin transporter gene
(SLC6A4) was used to characterize genetic vulnerability to depression and to test whether
5-HTT gene variation moderates the influence
of life stress on depression.
The serotonin system provides a logical
source of candidate genes for depression, because this system is the target of selective
serotonin reuptake–inhibitor drugs that are
effective in treating depression (9). The serotonin transporter has received particular attention because it is involved in the reuptake
of serotonin at brain synapses (10). The promoter activity of the 5-HTT gene, located on
17q11.2, is modified by sequence elements
within the proximal 5� regulatory region, designated the 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic
region (5-HTTLPR). The short (“s”) allele in
the 5-HTTLPR is associated with lower transcriptional efficiency of the promoter compared with the long (“l”) allele (11).
Evidence for an association between the
short promoter variant and depression is inconclusive (12). Although the 5-HTT gene may not
be directly associated with depression, it could
moderate the serotonergic response to stress.
Three lines of experimental research suggest
this hypothesis of a gene-by-environment (G �
E) interaction. First, in mice with disrupted
5-HTT, homozygous and heterozygous (5-HTT
–/– and �/–) strains exhibited more fearful
behavior and greater increases in the stress hormone (plasma) adrenocorticotropin in response
to stress compared to homozygous (5-HTT
�/�) controls, but in the absence of stress no
differences related to genotype were observed
(13). Second, in rhesus macaques, whose length
variation of the 5-HTTLPR is analogous to that
of humans, the short allele is associated with
decreased serotonergic function [lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
concentrations] among monkeys reared in
stressful conditions but not among normally
reared monkeys (14). Third, human neuroimaging research suggests that the stress response
is mediated by variations in the 5-HTTLPR.
Humans with one or two copies of the s allele
exhibit greater amygdala neuronal activity to
fearful stimuli compared to individuals homozygous for the l allele (15). Taken together,
these findings suggest the hypothesis that variations in the 5-HTT gene moderate psychopathological reactions to stressful experiences.
We tested this G � E hypothesis among
members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary
Health and Development Study (16). This
representative birth cohort of 1037 children
(52% male) has been assessed at ages 3, 5, 7,
9, 11, 13, 15, 18, and 21 and was virtually
intact (96%) at the age of 26 years. A total of
847 Caucasian non-Maori study members,
without stratification confounds, were divided into three groups on the basis of their
5-HTTLPR genotype (11): those with two


147; 17%), those with one copy of the s allele
(s/l heterozygotes; n � 435; 51%), and those
with two copies of the l allele (l/l homozygotes; n � 265; 31%). There was no difference in genotype frequencies between the
sexes [�[2](2) � 0.02, P � 0.99]. Stressful life
events occurring after the 21st birthday and
before the 26th birthday were assessed with
the aid of a life-history calendar (17), a highly reliable method for ascertaining life-event
histories (18). The 14 events included employment, financial, housing, health, and relationship stressors. Thirty percent of the
study members experienced no stressful life
events; 25% experienced one event; 20%,
two events; 11%, three events; and 15%, four
or more events. There were no significant
differences between the three genotype
groups in the number of life events they
experienced, F(2,846) � 0.56, P � 0.59,
suggesting that 5-HTTLPR genotype did not
influence exposure to stressful life events.
Study members were assessed for past-year
depression at age 26 with the use of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (19), which yields a
quantitative measure of depressive symptoms
and a categorical diagnosis of a major depressive episode according to Diagnostic and Sta_tistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)_
criteria (20). 17% of study members (58% female versus 42% male; odds ratio � 1.6; 95%
confidence interval from 1.1 to 2.2) met criteria
for a past-year major depressive episode, which
is comparable to age and sex prevalence rates
observed in U.S. epidemiological studies (21).
In addition, 3% of the study members reported
past-year suicide attempts or recurrent thoughts
about suicide in the context of a depressive
episode. We also collected informant reports
about symptoms of depression for 96% of study
members at age 26 by mailing a brief questionnaire to persons nominated by each study member as “someone who knows you well.”
We used a moderated regression framework (22), with sex as a covariate, to test the
association between depression and (i) 5HTTLPR genotype, (ii) stressful life events,
and (iii) their interaction (table S1). The interaction between 5-HTTLPR and life events
showed that the effect of life events on selfreports of depression symptoms at age 26 was
significantly stronger (P � 0.02) among individuals carrying an s allele than among l/l
homozygotes (Fig. 1A). We further tested
whether life events could predict within-individual increases in depression symptoms over
time among individuals with an s allele by
statistically controlling for the baseline number of depressive symptoms they had before
the life events occurred (table S1). The significant interaction (P � 0.05) showed that
individuals carrying an s allele whose life
events occurred after their 21st birthday experienced increases in depressive symptoms

whereas l/l homozygotes did not (b � 0.17,

The G � E interaction also showed that
stressful life events predicted a diagnosis of
major depression among carriers of an s allele
but not among l/l homozygotes (P � 0.056,
Fig. 1B). We further tested whether life
events could predict the onset of new diagnosed depression among carriers of an s allele
(table S1). We excluded from analysis study
members who were diagnosed with depression before age 21. The significant interaction (P � 0.02) showed that life events occurring after their 21st birthdays predicted
depression at age 26 among carriers of an s
allele who did not have a prior history of
depression (b � 0.79, SE � 0.25, z � 3.16,
_P �_ 0.002 among s/s homozygotes and b �
0.41, SE � 0.12, z � 3.29, P � 0.001 among
s/l heterozygotes) but did not predict onset of
new depression among l/l homozygotes (b �
0.08, SE � 0.20, z � 0.42, P � 0.67). Further
analyses showed that stressful life events predicted suicide ideation or attempt among individuals carrying an s allele but not among
l/l homozygotes (P � 0.05, Fig. 1C). The
hypothesized G � E interaction was also
significant when we predicted informant reports of age-26 depression (P � 0.01), an
analysis that ruled out the possibility of selfreport bias (Fig. 1D). The interaction showed
that the effect of life events on informant
reports of depression was stronger among
individuals carrying an s allele than among l/l
homozygotes. These analyses attest that the
5-HTT gene interacts with life events to predict depression symptoms, an increase in
symptoms, depression diagnoses, new-onset
diagnoses, suicidality, and an informant’s report of depressed behavior.
This evidence that 5-HTTLPR variation
moderates the effect of life events on depression does not constitute unambiguous evidence of a G � E interaction, because exposure to life events may be influenced by
genetic factors; if individuals have a heritable
tendency to enter situations where they encounter stressful life events, these events may
simply be a genetically saturated marker (23,
_24). Thus, what we have identified as a_
gene � environment interaction predicting
depression could actually reflect a gene �
“gene” interaction between the 5-HTTLPR
and other genes we did not measure. We
reasoned that, if our measure of life events
represents merely genetic risk, then life
events would interact with 5-HTTLPR even
if they occurred after the depression episode.
However, if our measure of life events represents environmental stress, then the timing
of life events relative to depression must

occur after depression should not interact
with 5-HTTLPR to postdict depression. We
tested this hypothesis by substituting the age26 measure of depression with depression
assessed in this longitudinal study when
study members were 21 and 18 years old,
before the occurrence of the measured life
events between the ages of 21 and 26 years.
Whereas the 5-HTTLPR � life events interaction predicted depression at the age of 26


depression reported at age 21 nor at the age of
18 years (table S2), indicating our finding is
a true G � E interaction.
If 5-HTT genotype moderates the depressogenic influence of stressful life events, it
should moderate the effect of life events that
occurred not just in adulthood but also of
stressful experiences that occurred in earlier
developmental periods. Based on this hypothesis, we tested whether adult depression was

the association between childhood maltreatment (between the ages of 3 and 11 years) and

of 5-HTT genotype. Among the 147 s/s homozygotes, 92 (63%), 39 (27%), and 16 (11%)
study members were in the no maltreatment,
probable maltreatment, and severe maltreatment groups, respectively. Among the 435 s/l

HTTLPR and childhood maltreatment that
occurred during the first decade of life (16,
_25). Consistent with the G �_ E hypothesis,
the longitudinal prediction from childhood
maltreatment to adult depression was significantly moderated by 5-HTTLPR (table S3).
The interaction showed (P � 0.05) that childhood maltreatment predicted adult depression
only among individuals carrying an s allele
but not among l/l homozygotes (Fig. 2).
We previously showed that variations in
the gene encoding the neurotransmitter-metabolizing enzyme monoamine oxidase A
(MAOA) moderate children’s sensitivity to
maltreatment (25). MAOA has high affinity
for 5-HTT, raising the possibility that the
protective effect of the l/l allele on psychiatric morbidity is further augmented by the
presence of a genotype conferring high
MAOA activity (13, 26). However, we found
that the moderation of life stress on depression was specific to a polymorphism in the
5-HTT gene, because this effect was observed regardless of the individual’s MAOA
gene status (tables S4 and S5).
Until this study’s findings are replicated,

mature. Nonetheless, although carriers of an s
5-HTTLPR allele who experienced four or
more life events constituted only 10% of the
birth cohort, they accounted for almost onequarter (23%) of the 133 cases of diagnosed
depression. Moreover, among cohort members suffering four or more stressful life
events, 33% of individuals with an s allele
became depressed, whereas only 17% of the
l/l homozygotes developed depression (Fig.
3). Thus, the G � E’s attributable risk and
predictive sensitivity indicate that more
knowledge about the functional properties of
the 5-HTT gene may lead to better pharmacological treatments for those already depressed. Although the short 5-HTTLPR variant is too prevalent for discriminatory screening (over half of the Caucasian population
has an s allele), a microarray of genes might
eventually identify those needing prophylaxis
against life’s stressful events (27).

5-HTTLPR and depression has been inconsistent (12), perhaps because prior studies
have not considered participants’ stress histories. In this study, no direct association
between the 5-HTT gene and depression was
observed. Previous experimental paradigms,
including 5-HTT knockout mice (13), stressreared rhesus macaques (14), and human
functional neuroimaging (15), have shown
that the 5-HTT gene can interact with environmental conditions, although these experiments did not address depression. Our study
demonstrates that this G � E interaction extends to the natural development of depression in a representative sample of humans.
However, we could not test hypotheses about
brain endophenotypes (28) intermediate between the 5-HTT gene and depression be

cause of the difficulty of taking CSF or functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements in an epidemiological cohort.
Much genetic research has been guided by
the assumption that genes cause diseases, but
the expectation that direct paths will be found
from gene to disease has not proven fruitful for
complex psychiatric disorders (29). Our findings of G � E interaction for the 5-HTT gene
and another candidate gene, MAOA (25), point
to a different, evolutionary model. This model
assumes that genetic variants maintained at
high prevalence in the population probably act
to promote organisms’ resistance to environmental pathogens (30). We extend the concept
of environmental pathogens to include traumatic, stressful life experiences and propose that
the effects of genes may be uncovered when
such pathogens are measured (in naturalistic
studies) or manipulated (in experimental studies). To date, few linkage studies detect genes,
many candidate gene studies fail consistent replication, and genes that replicate account for
little variation in the phenotype (29). If replicated, our G � E findings will have implications for improving research in psychiatric genetics. Incomplete gene penetrance, a major
source of error in linkage pedigrees, can be
explained if a gene’s effects are expressed only
among family members exposed to environmental risk. If risk exposure differs between
samples, candidate genes may fail replication.
If risk exposure differs among participants
within a sample, genes may account for little
variation in the phenotype. We speculate that
some multifactorial disorders, instead of resulting from variations in many genes of small
effect, may result from variations in fewer
genes whose effects are conditional on exposure to environmental risks.
