ABSTRACT

Background. Serotonin is a good candidate for major depression. We attempted to replicate the
study by Caspi and colleagues [Science (2003) 301, 386–389] which reported a significant interaction
between serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) genotype and stressful life events when predicting
major depression.

Method. We typed the serotonin promoter 5-HTTLPR gene in 1206 male and female twins aged
19–78 years (mean=39, S.D.=11). A DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression was available for 1199
twins. Most of these twins had participated in a 1988–1990 study which included a stressful life
events inventory and self-report measure of depression based on the SCL-90 and DSSI/sAD. Complete 5-HTT genotype and life events data, self-report symptoms and major depression diagnoses
were available for 1091 subjects. We regressed categorical and ordinal measures of depression onto
stressful life events and genotype.

Results. There were significant main effects for stressful life events but there was no evidence for
any effect of 5-HTT genotype, nor a genotyperstressful life event interaction.

Conclusions. Regardless of whether our results were based on binary logistic or ordinal regression
analyses we found no evidence to support a main effect of 5-HTTLPR, or an interaction between
the 5-HTTLPR genotype and stressful life events on major depression. Only 20% of our subjects
were aged below 30 years. It is possible that the effect reported by Caspi and colleagues is specific to
young people, in which case our study has much less power in this age group.


INTRODUCTION

The serotonergic system is a strong genetic candidate for major depression and suicide. In their
review, Owens & Nemeroff (1994) highlighted
considerable evidence to support the hypothesis
that there are significant differences in the serotonergic systems in patients with and without
major depression. It is known that the ‘s’ allele
of the polymorphism reduces the transcriptional

efficiency of this serotonin promoter, resulting
in decreased 5-HTT expression and serotonin
uptake in lymphoblasts (Lesch et al. 1996).
More recently, Caspi et al. (2003) have reported that variation in the 5-HTT gene-linked
polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) moderates the
influence of stressful life events (SLEs) on major
depression. Based on a sample of 1037 adults
aged 26 years, the influence of SLEs on the incidence of major depression was significantly
greater amongst homozygous and heterozygous
carriers of the short (‘s’) allele in the 5-HTTLPR
genotype. The same genotype by environment
(GrE) interaction also approached significance
for suicidal behaviour.

Aim
Using a sample of Australian twins, the aim of
this study is to determine whether variation in
the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) genotype moderates the influence of SLEs on major
depression and suicidal behaviour.

MATERIALS AND METHOD
Sample
Subjects were drawn from the Australian
National Health and Medical Research Council
Twin Register (ATR). The ATR is a volunteer
register founded in 1978 with approximately
25 000 twins of all types and ages enrolled at
various stages of active participation. This represents approximately 10–20% of living twins
in Australia. Numerous analyses have shown
that the ATR is typical of the Australian population in many respects including the prevalence
of psychiatric symptoms (Kendler et al. 1986),
although the ATR sample tends to be slightly
more middle class and educated than average,
particularly for males (Baker et al. 1996).
The current project was based on an older
cohort of 3808 twin pairs born before 1965
which was first surveyed during 1980–1982 and
was then followed up during 1988–1990 to investigate persistence and changes in drinking habits.
Mailedquestionnaireortelephoneinterviewdata
were obtained from 2997 complete twin pairs
and 334 singles, with an individual response rate
of 83%, and a complete pair response rate of
79%. At the same time, the 576 incomplete twin
pair respondents (singletons) and their co-twins
from the 1980–1982 study were also followed-up
with an identical questionnaire. The 1988–1990
study contained a lengthy self-report Health
and Lifestyle Questionnaire (HLQ) which incorporated many of the questions sent out to
the same twins 8 years previously such as
tobacco use, alcohol consumption, personality,
sociodemographic variables, psychiatric symptoms, SLEs, social attitudes and numerous
other behavioural measures (Heath et al. 1994).
Four years later in 1992, 3882 twin pairs, many
of whom had been targeted for the 1988–1990
study, were approached and asked to participate
in a study which included a semi-structured
assessment for the genetics of alcoholism. We
set out to obtain blood samples from as many of


these twins as possible, selected only on the basis
of willingness to cooperate. Samples were obtained from 3347 individual twins (comprising
1383 complete twin pairs and 581 singletons)
before funds were exhausted.

DNA extraction and genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted (Miller et al. 1988)
from peripheral venous blood samples. Zygosity
of same-sex twins was determined by typing nine
independent DNA microsatellite polymorphisms at QIMR using the profiler AmpFLSTRR
Profiler PlusT multiplex marker set (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). All twins
were also typed for ABO, Rh and MNS blood
groups by the Red Cross Blood Service in
Brisbane. Genotypes for the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were determined using the method
described by Turker et al. (1998), with primers
5k-GGCGTTGCCGCTCTGAATGCC and 5kCAGGGGAGATCCTGGGAGAGGT. The
PCR products were separated on 7% polyacrylamide gel and visualized with ethidium bromide.
The product lengths were 221 bp (short allele)
and 265 bp (long allele).

Imputation of missing genotypes
There were 15 monozygotic twins with missing
5-HTTLPR genotypes whose values were
imputed using their co-twin’s genotype. A total
of 1206 subjects had complete 5-HTTLPR
genotype information. The age range for this
sample was 19–78 years (mean=39 years, S.D.=
11 years). The sample was then split into three
groups on the basis of genotype. The frequencies
for the ‘ss’, ‘sl’ and ‘ll’ genotypes were 22%
(n=262), 48% (n=577) and 30% (n=367) respectively. These were not significantly different
from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (x[2]1[=][1.81),]
although this was tested without regard to the
relatedness of twins. In addition, there was no
significant difference in genotype frequencies
between the sexes (x[2]2[=][0.82,][ p][=][0.66). Popu-]
lation stratification was unlikely given that more
than 95% of the subjects’ great-grandparents
were reported as being of northern European
ancestry, mainly from Britain and Ireland.

1988–1990 General Health Questionnaire
Details of the SLEs and self-report measures of
depression which formed part of the 1988–1990
questionnaire are described below.

SLEs
Originally identified by Brown & Harris (1978)
and Bebbington et al. (1981), the SLEs were
adapted from the List of Threatening Experiences (LTE) by Brugha et al. (1985). In this
study, items were divided into two categories
based on previous research which has examined
these events in terms of (i) personal events which
primarily happen to the subject and (ii) network
events which happen to an individual in his
or her social network (Kendler & KarkowskiShuman, 1997; Kendler et al. 2001 b).
The 12-item personal SLE inventory in the
1988–1990 study was very similar to that used
by Caspi and colleagues. Subjects were asked if
during the past 12 months any of the following
events had occurred: divorce; marital separation; broken engagement or steady relationship; separation from other loved one or close
friend; serious illness or injury; serious accident
(not involving personal injury); being burgled
or robbed; laid off or sacked from job; other
serious difficulties at work; major financial
problems; legal troubles or involvement with
police; and living in unpleasant surroundings.
We expanded the study to also include network
SLEs which were assessed with a 28-item inventory similar to that used by Kendler and colleagues (1995, 1997, 2001 b). The first 21 items
asked whether, during the last 12 months, a
spouse, child, mother or father, twin, sibling,
relative, or someone close had died, suffered a
serious illness/injury, or suffered a serious personal crisis. An additional seven items asked
subjects whether, during the last 12 months,
they had any serious problems getting along
with their spouse, other family members, a close
friend, a neighbour, someone living with them
(e.g. child or elderly parent), their twin, or a
workmate or co-worker.
In order to correct for positive skewness as
well as maintain consistency with Caspi and
colleagues, SLE scores were re-coded onto a
5-point ordinal scale using the same categories
as Caspi and colleagues, namely 0, 1, 2, 3, 4+
life events. When based on the entire 1988–1990
sample, there were no significant sex differences
in the distribution of personal life events ( x[2]4[=]
5[.]95, p=0[.]20). There was, however, a significant
sex difference for network life events (x[2]4[=][12.58,]
p<0[.]05). Females reported a greater number of


network life events than males. When based on
the genotyped sample, this difference was no
longer significant. Complete personal (n=1099)
and network (n=1102) SLE data were available
from 90% of the genotyped sample. There were
no significant sex differences for personal (x[2]4[=]
1[.]27, p=0[.]87) or network (x[2]4[=][1.32,][ p][=][0.86)]
events.

Depression – Self-report questionnaire
Nineteen items from the SCL-90 (Derogatis
et al. 1973) were combined with the 14 similarly
worded items from the DSSI/sAD (Bedford
et al. 1976) scales and all 33 items were included
in the 1988–1990 questionnaire. On the basis of
previous factor analyses (Gillespie et al. 1999), a
self-report measure of depression was calculated
based on nine items. Each item had been rephrased to conform to the DSSI/sAD format of
inquiry, ‘Recently I have had …’ rather than use
the SCL-90 format, ‘In the past two weeks …’.
The response set was also changed from a
5-point scale of distress from ‘not at all’ (0) to
‘extremely’ (4) (Derogatis et al. 1973) to the
DSSI/sAD 4-point distress scale: (1) ‘not at all’,
(2) ‘a little’, (3) ‘a lot’, (4) ‘unbearably’. Complete depression scores were available from 1090
subjects or 89% of the genotyped sample. In
order to correct for positive skewness, selfreport depression scores were recoded to a
3-point ordinal scale (0=0; 1–4=1; 5–27=2).
When based on the entire 1988–1990 sample
(n=5775) there was a highly significant association between sex and the recoded depression
scores (x[2]2[=][20.75,] p<0[.]001), with females
having higher scores of moderate and severe
depression (35%, 13%) than males (33%, 9%).
However, when based on the genotyped subjects
with complete self-report depression data
(n=1090), the sex difference was no longer
significant (x[2]2[=][1.58,][ p][=][0.46).]

Depression – clinical interview
Many of the subjects who participated in the
1988–1990 survey were followed up approximately 4 years later in 1992 with a psychiatric
interview by telephone. The interview included
an adaptation of the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA,
2004) which was modified for administration by
telephone interview. The SSAGA was originally
designed to assess the physical, psychological

and social manifestations of alcohol abuse
or dependence and other psychiatric disorders
according to DSM-III-R criteria. The scoring algorithm was modified in order to obtain
DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression. In
addition, the interview ascertained general
demographic information, medical history, information about tobacco use, suicide attempts,
and included a psychosis screener to identify
individuals requiring clinical follow-up.
Ninety-eight per cent (n=1191) of the genotyped sample completed the SSAGA interview.
The average time between the 1988–1990 questionnaire return date and SSAGA interview
was 46 months (S.D.=7 months, range=2–60
months). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the SSAGA
DSM-IV major depression was variously redefined based on age of first onset: (i) lifetime
diagnoses, (ii) diagnoses made before the reporting of the SLEs (<1988–1990), (iii) diagnoses
made either during or after the reporting period


(o1988–1990), and (iv) diagnoses made exclusively after the reporting period (>1988–1990).
Apart from a lifetime diagnosis, any cases with a
date of onset outside the diagnostic time-frame
were given a non-positive diagnosis.
Lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV major depression was significantly higher among females
than males (see Table 1) and approached significance for diagnoses made before the 12-month
reporting period for SLEs. For diagnoses made
during or after the reporting period, the sex
difference in the prevalence of major depression
were not significant. When attempting to replicate the GrE interaction reported by Caspi
et al. (2003), a total of 1091 subjects with 5HTTLPR and personal SLE data, had also
completed the psychiatric interview for DSMIV major depression.

Suicide
The SSAGA interview also included an assessment of suicide behaviour based on lifetime
history of suicide planning, suicide attempts
and persistent thoughts of suicide (Statham
et al. 1998). Complete data were available from
1190 subjects of whom 13% (n=96) and 12%
(n=54) of males and females respectively indicated that at some stage in their lives they had
persistent thoughts, had planned or attempted
suicide. There was no association between sex
and suicidal behaviour (x[2]1[=][0.26,][ p][=][0.61).]

coefficient (‘s’=0, ‘sl’=1, ‘ll’=2), and b3 is
the SLE regression coefficient (0 events=0;
1 event=1; 2 events=2; 3 events=3; o4
events=4).

Ordinal regression
We fit an ordinal data regression model in SPSS
(version 11.0.1) to the recoded depression
scores. Tests of parallel lines were also run to
ensure that the slopes across all levels of the
dependent measure were equal.


The current analyses ignored the relatedness
of twins by treating all subjects as unrelated individuals. Although this will not produce biased
estimates, it will underestimate their variance
and hence overestimate their significance. Normally, if significant estimates are obtained,
then analyses ought to be repeated using more
elaborate methods which take into account
the degree of biological relatedness (e.g. STATA
or Mx). As will be seen, this is unnecessary here.

RESULTS
Binary logistic regression
Results for the binary logistic regression analyses
based on personal and network SLEs are shown

personal events was associated with increased
liability to lifetime DSM-IV major depression,
as well as DSM-IV major depression first diagnosed before the 12-month reporting period. The

There was no evidence to support a 5-HTTLPR

The analyses were repeated using network life
events. The main effects of sex and network
life events approached significance for lifetime
major depression. There was a significant effect
for age for diagnoses made before the 12-month
reporting period. There was no evidence to
support a 5-HTTLPRrnetwork life events

The number of personal SLEs was also significantly associated with persistent thinking,
planning or attempting suicides. The association
between network events and suicidal behaviour
approached significance at the 0[.]05 level.

Ordinal data regression
In the test of parallel lines, a model which constrained the regression slopes to be equal across
all levels of the recoded self-report depression
scores provide a good fit to the personal (Dx[2]5[=]

life-event models. As is also shown in Table 2,
the ordinal regression analyses revealed significant main effects for both personal and network
life events. Consistent with results based on the


FIG. 3. Mean predicted probability of lifetime DSM-IV major
depression by number of network stressful life events (SLEs). Based
on binary logistic regression. Genotype: –m–, ss; –$–, sl; –.–, ll.

binary regression analyses, there were no main
effects for genotype at any level, nor was there
any evidence to a support GrE interaction.


DISCUSSION

We found no evidence to support either a genotypic main effect or a GrE interaction. This
conclusion was consistent across the categorical
and ordinal measures of depression and regardless of whether or not the results were based
on psychiatric diagnoses made before, during
or after the reporting period of personal and
network SLEs. Moreover, the signs of the
non-significant terms were all opposite to those
reported by Caspi et al. (2003).
In addition to age and sex, there were main
effects for SLEs on depression. For instance, a
lifetime diagnosis of DSM-IV major depression
was significantly predicted by personal events
as well as self-reports of thinking, planning and
attempted suicides. Network events approached
significance for DSM-IV major depression. The
regression of personal events onto diagnoses
of major depression made during or after the
1988–1990 reporting period also approached
significance.
Because we did not have lifetime assessments
of SLEs we cannot conclude from our data that
depression ‘causes’ SLEs. Nonetheless, there
is evidence to suggest that the relationship


-----

f f g yp j p


between SLEs and major depression is in
part causal (Kendler et al. 1993a, 1999, 2000).
Indeed, some of the strongest predictors of
DSM-III-R major depression are SLEs that
are followed by genetic factors, previous history
of major depression and neuroticism (Kendler
et al. 1993a, 2004).
The depressogenic impact of SLEs has been
shown to decline markedly over time (Kendler
et al. 1999). The fact that our results reveal main
effects for recently experienced SLEs in the prediction of lifetime depression therefore suggests
that these items are indexing a persistent liability
to encounter adverse events which in turn increases the risk of depression. This possibility
is supported by findings from previous twin
studies, as well as preliminary analyses of the
current data, which have shown that familial
aggregation for the total number of SLEs is
significant, and is best explained by aspects of
the shared environment and genetic effects
(Kendler et al. 1993 b; Foley et al. 1996; Kendler
& Karkowski-Shuman, 1997; Bolinskey et al.
2004).
Why we do not see stronger main effects for
stressors when regressed onto major depression
diagnosed during and after the reporting period
for life events is uncertain. Apart from a smaller
number of positive diagnoses which reduce
power, one explanation is that the relationship
between the number of life events and major
depression is diminished by the number of previous depressive episodes. One previous study
has shown that for every additional previous
episode of major depression there is an increased risk of further episodes (Kendler et al.
2000). This risk increases until the total number
of previous episodes reaches nine, after which
no additional risk is seen. This is further complicated by interactions between the number of
previous episodes of major depression, putative
effect of particular SLEs as well as the degree
of genetic risk (see Kendler & Eaves, 1986;
Kendler & Karkowski-Shuman, 1997; Kendler
et al. 2000, 2001 a). For example, as the number
of previous episodes of depression rises from
0 to 9, the strength of the association between
stressful events and depression reportedly declines by 13% (Kendler et al. 2000). This decline
in association is consistent with a ‘kindling’
hypothesis which predicts that SLEs are more
likely to precede the onset of major depression


in individuals experiencing their first episode
of major depression (Kendler et al. 2000). In
other words, as the number of previous episodes
increases, individuals require less provocation;
they become increasingly desensitized to stressful events and require fewer events to trigger
depression. This might also suggest that early
onsets of depression are more likely to be influenced by GrE interactions than late-onset
episodes.
As previously mentioned, the impact of genetic risk can also alter the association between
SLEs and depression. Even after controlling for
number of previous depressive episodes, Kendler
& Karkowski-Shuman (1997) have shown that
genetic risk factors alone, increase the probability of experiencing SLEs and selection into
high-risk environments. An increased genetic
risk can also influence the ‘speed of kindling’ as
well as determine the levels of ‘pre-kindling’
prior to a stressful event (Kendler et al. 2001a).
The ‘speed of kindling’ hypothesis predicts
that everyone begins with the same degree of
association between stressful events and risk of
developing major depression, but that the rate
of kindling is positively correlated with genetic
risk (Kendler et al. 2001 a). In other words,
people who are genetically disposed towards
depression, require a shorter time-interval before significantly fewer stressful events are
needed to induce depression.
In terms of ‘pre-kindling’, people who are at
high genetic risk are already pre-kindled and do
not require much in the way of stressful events
to trigger depression. As a result, the association
between stressful events and depression is
weaker for genetically at-risk individuals. Evidence for this hypothesis is stronger. Based on a
sample of 2395 twins who were interviewed up
to four times, Kendler et al. (2001 a) reported
that the decline in association between stressful
events and major depression with increasing
number of previous episodes of depression was
strongest in low genetic risk individuals as opposed to weak in individuals at high genetic risk.
In terms of causal models, Kendler & Karkowski-Shuman (1997) have proposed two pathways. The first is a direct pathway from genetic
risk, to major depression, to SLEs, in what it
is more commonly referred to as a ‘scar’ effect.
The second is a diathesis model, whereby liability to major depression and exposure to SLEs

p


are caused by a third underlying trait, such as
neuroticism. Based on a community sample of
2150 sib pairs, 410 trios and 81 quads, Rijsdijk
et al. (2001) have found that correlations between neuroticism and adverse life events are
low and that there appears to be little interaction between neuroticism and adverse life events
in the prediction mood and affect as measured
by the General Health Questionnaire (Rijsdijk
et al. 2001). Recently, however, Kendler et al.
(2004) examined data from 7500 individual
twins and found an interaction between neuroticism and adversity, such that individuals with
high neuroticism are at greater overall risk for
major depression, and are more sensitive to the
depressogenic effects of SLEs. The same study
also found an interaction between adversity and
sex, such that the excess risk for major depression in women was confined to individuals
with low stress exposure.
Unlike Caspi et al. (2003), we found no significant sex differences in terms of the overall
number of personal and network SLEs. This is
consistent with previous findings ( Kendler et al.
2001 b). When based on the entire 1988–1990
sample, we again found no sex differences in the
overall distribution of personal events (x[2]4[=][5.95,]
p=0[.]20). It was only at the item level that sex
differences emerged. Women were more likely to
endorse items such as separation from loved ones
or close friends. Men, on the other hand, were
more likely to experience frequent difficulties at
work. For network events, the sex difference
was significant with women reporting a greater
number (x[2]4[=][12.58,][ p][<][0.05) and at the item]
level, women more frequently endorsed network
events relating to serious illness/injury of children, mother or father dying, co-twins or other
relatives with a serious illness/injury/crisis, and
someone close experiencing a personal crisis.

Strengths and limitations
It is important to interpret our study in the
context of its strengths and limitations. In terms
of strengths, the 1099 subjects with complete
genotyping, SLE data and psychiatric assessments was slightly larger than the sample of
1037 subjects reported by Caspi et al. (2003).
The SSAGA was administered by trained lay
interviewers and is itself a highly reliable and
validated instrument for diagnosing psychiatric


disorders (Bucholz et al. 1994; Hesselbrock et al.
1999). We also assessed a wide range of SLEs
which were largely identical to those used by
Caspi and colleagues.
Eight limitations are noteworthy. First, the
age range of our sample was much broader than
that reported by Caspi and colleagues. Their
subjects were all aged 26 years. Although the
regression of age onto the clinical and ordinal
measures of depression revealed no significant
main effects, the current age distribution may
have diminished our power to detect an interaction, including important age differences in
the aetiology of depression. As mentioned previously, early onsets of depression may be more
influenced by GrE interactions than late-onset
episodes. If, for comparability with Caspi et al.
(2003), we limited our analyses to subjects below
the age of 30 years, the sample size was greatly
reduced (n=244) and no GrE interaction was
observed. GrE interactions are notoriously
hard to detect in any free-living species. Even
with the specification of a measured genotype
(Martin & Oakeshott, 1983; Eaves & Sullivan,
2001), a measured environment (Heath et al.
1998; Boomsma et al. 1999), or both (Martin
et al. 1987; Caspi et al. 2003), the power remains poor. In order to increase power to detect
a GrE interaction we plan to genotype an
additional 2600 subjects for the 5-HTTLPR
genotype.
Second, Caspi et al. (2003) reported on life
events over a 5-year period. The distribution of
personal stressors in our sample was markedly
different from that reported by Caspi et al. Our
data relied on life events reported over a 12month period. Consequently, it is not surprising
that they found a higher prevalence of subjects
who reported four or more SLEs, whereas the
majority of subjects in our sample reported no
stressful events. Although there are no comparable data to determine whether our sample of
twins was representative of the general population in terms of the prevalence of SLEs, a comparison with a previous study of life events over
12 months based on the Virginia Twin Registry,
based on a sample of 4630 twins, found that
the distribution of item responses was, in fact,
similar (Kendler et al. 1993b). Dividing our
sample into three age cohorts shows a similar
distribution of total life events in each age group
(results not shown).

Third, we were unable to derive a continuous
symptom count based on the nine diagnostic
items for major depression used in the 1992
SSAGA interview. The protocol of the structured telephone interview skipped over the criterion A symptoms 3–9 if symptoms 1 and 2
were not endorsed. As an alternative, we used
the 9-item self-report depression scale administered as part of the 1988–1990 survey. It was
inappropriate to run OLS regressions because
of the severe skewness. Therefore, ordinal regressions were run instead, and again there was
no evidence of a GrE interaction.
Fourth, our regression analyses failed to take
account of the non-independence of twin
subjects. This can lead to overestimation of
significance of regression terms. However, since
none of the regression terms of interest even
approached significance on the assumption of
independence, this refinement, which is readily
implemented in STATA (StataCorp, 1999) or Mx
was uncalled for.
Fifth, our failure to replicate a GrE interaction may be related to the analyses used. Kendler
et al. (1995) used a logistic regression and found
no evidence of an interaction between SLEs and
genetic risk when predicting the onset of major
depression. This was despite the fact that the
depressogenic effect of SLEs was much greater
for persons already at high genetic risk for depression which is consistent with a model for
genetic control of sensitivity to the environment
(Kendler et al. 1995). When the authors reanalysed their data using regressions based on
the scale of simple probabilities (versus logarithmic) they found a significant GrE interaction.
The sixth limitation concerns the sampling
procedure. One of the goals of the SSAGA survey was to acquire blood samples from as many
of these twins as possible. Although the genotyped twins were primarily selected on the basis
of willingness to cooperate, there was preferential selection for complete pairs. Given the
study’s primary objectives, some effort was also
made to enrich this sample for cases with alcohol dependence, but this was only moderately
successful. The prevalence of DSM-IV alcohol
dependence was higher amongst the genotyped
female respondents (x[2]1[=][7.10,][ p][<][0.01), whereas]
for males, there were no significant differences between the genotyped and ungenotyped
samples (x[2]1[=][0.66,][ p][=][0.42).]


Seventh, there were also small but significant
age differences between the genotyped and ungenotyped samples. Of the 5999 psychiatric interviews conducted as part of the SSAGA study,
date of birth was available from 5876 subjects.
The genotyped male and female subjects were
approximately 1[1]2 [years younger than the ungeno-]
typed SSAGA subjects. This is not surprising,
since to be bled they had to healthy and alive.
If the non-significant sex differences in selfreport depression are related to the genotyping
selection procedure, we are unable to explain
why the sex differences for major depression persist. As shown in Table 1, the lifetime prevalence
of DSM-IV major depression remained significantly higher among females compared to males,
and approached significance for diagnoses made
before the 12-month reporting period for SLEs.
The final limitation concerns our use of the
total number of life events. Future replications
will also need to pay closer attention to the
contextual aspects and putative independence
of life events. Contextual threat can be rated
in terms of how most people would be expected
to feel about a stressful event, whereas independence measures the probability that a life
event is caused by an individual’s own behaviour (Kendler et al. 1999). When event severity is
controlled for, dependent events appear to be
more strongly associated with major depression
than independent events (Kendler et al. 1999).
Another study has found that the severity of
SLEs is positively and significantly correlated
with the number of previous depressive episodes
(Kendler et al. 2000). In a more recent study of
life events rated in terms of contextual threat,
diagnoses of major depression and mixed depression and generalized anxiety are predicted
by higher ratings of loss and humiliation
(Kendler et al. 2003). This is in contrast to diagnoses of generalized anxiety which are better
predicted by higher ratings of loss and danger
(Kendler et al. 2003).

CONCLUSION

The number of SLEs was significantly associated with continuous and categorical measures
of depression. Regardless of whether our results were based on binary logistic or ordinal
regression analyses, we found no evidence to
support a main effect of 5-HTTLPR or an

p


interaction between the 5-HTTLPR genotype
and SLEs on major depression. It is possible
that the effect reported by Caspi and colleagues
is specific to young people (in their twenties), in
which case our study has much less power in this
age group. Our results do not support such an
interaction as a lifelong phenomenon.
