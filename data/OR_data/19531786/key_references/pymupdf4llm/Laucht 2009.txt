Abstract

Previous research examining gene–environment interaction (GrE) with regard to vulnerability to
depression and anxiety has yielded conflicting results. The present study was designed to further investigate GrE between 5-HTTLPR and exposure to environmental adversity, using different phenotypic and
genotypic characterizations as well as different types of adversity within a prospective study design. Data
were available from an ongoing epidemiological cohort study following the outcome of early risk factors
from birth to adulthood. At age 19 yr, 309 participants (142 males, 167 females) were characterized
on measures of depression and anxiety through interview and questionnaire (DSM-IV diagnosis,
Beck Depression Inventory, Harm Avoidance). Environmental adversity was assessed at birth (family
adversity), and at age 19 yr (stressful life events). Bi- and tri-allelic 5-HTTLPR genotypes were obtained
from genomic DNA. Results indicated that depression and anxiety in 19-yr-olds were strongly associated
with both family adversity and stressful life events. Individuals with the LL genotype of 5-HTTLPR who
were exposed to high family adversity displayed significantly higher rates of depressive or anxiety
disorders and had more depressive symptoms than those without either condition. This GrE replicates
recent findings from an epidemiological cohort study of adolescents but is in contrast to many previous
reports suggesting an interaction with the S allele. No evidence for GrE was obtained with regard to
current stressful life events and trait anxiety. One possible source for the conflicting findings might be
attributed to heterogeneity in depression phenotypes and environmental adversity.

disorders are associated with significant morbidity
and increased mortality and co-occurrence of other
clinical syndromes (such as substance use disorder)
is common. The social and economic consequences
of these conditions are huge; major depression is currently the leading cause of disability in individuals
aged 15–44 yr, and it is estimated that it will rank first
in the global burden of disease by 2030 (Mathers &
Loncar, 2006). The comorbidity of these disorders is
high, with prospective studies indicating that anxiety


-----

disorders often precede the onset of depression and
identify individuals at risk for developing depression
(Beesdo et al. 2007). Despite intense research efforts,
progress in understanding the aetiology of these disorders is limited. Genetic epidemiological studies
reported moderate heritability, with an estimated
genetic contribution of y40–50% for depression and
30–40% for anxiety disorders, although the specific genes that confer risk are largely unidentified
(Hettema et al. 2001; McGuffin et al. 2003).
Of the brain systems suggested to be involved in the
aetiology of these disorders, much attention has been
placed on serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission. A
critical role in the regulation of serotonin function in
the brain pertains to the serotonin transporter (5-HTT),
making the gene encoding this protein a prominent
candidate for genetic association studies. This locus
contains a well-studied bi-allelic polymorphism in the
promoter region (5-HTTLPR) consisting of two common alleles, which appear to result in differential
5-HTT expression and function (Heils et al. 1996; Lesch
et al. 1996). Compared with the ‘long’ (L) variant, the
‘short’ (S) allele was found to exhibit significantly
lower transcriptional activity of the 5-HTT gene in
vitro. Recently, a third functional allele has been described, resulting from an A>G substitution in the
L allele, which was reported to be equivalent in expression to the S allele (Nakamura et al. 2000). Failure
to distinguish between these alleles may be one reason
for the inconsistency in previous studies investigating
the effects of 5-HTTLPR.
Since the first reports by Lesch et al. (1996), numerous studies have examined a potential role of 5HTTLPR in determining a variety of personality traits
and psychiatric disorders, including depression and
anxiety. However, a consistent picture of the contribution of this polymorphism has not yet emerged.
In a meta-analysis surveying 17 independent samples,
evidence for a significant, albeit weak association of
5-HTTLPR with bipolar depression was found, indicating that the S allele increased the risk (OR 1.13,
95% CI 1.05–1.22). While no association with unipolar
depression was detected in this meta-analysis which
was comprised of samples of small sizes (Lasky-Su et
al. 2005), a subsequent analysis conducted in a large
and homogeneous sample did find association (OR
1.26, 95% CI 1.07–1.48) (Hoefgen et al. 2005). A metaanalysis of the association between 5-HTTLPR and
trait anxiety based on 26 studies failed to provide
support for a relationship between anxiety and the
presence of the S allele (Schinka et al. 2004). Recently,
in a meta-analysis of 51 studies, the negative findings
of previous surveys was confirmed with regard to two


measures of trait anxiety [Harm Avoidance (HA) and
EPQ Neuroticism], suggesting, however, a possible
association with NEO Neuroticism (Munafo et al.
2008c).
Epidemiological studies have amply demonstrated
that stress constitutes a major risk factor for the development and persistence of depression and anxiety.
However, little is known as to why certain individuals
exposed to specific environmental pathogens actually
develop a disorder while others remain unaffected.
Only very recently have researchers started to investigate the importance of interactions between genetic
and environmental factors (GrE) in the development
of these disorders. In a seminal study, Caspi et al.
(2003) reported an interaction between 5-HTTLPR and
depression, demonstrating that the S allele was associated with depression only in individuals exposed
to stressful life events (SLE). These findings have
attracted a large number of replication attempts, the
majority of which provided results largely consistent
with the initial reports (Uher & McGuffin, 2008). While
a similar relationship was confirmed for alcohol use,
no evidence was found for GrE in anxiety.
Although the majority of previous positive GrE
findings showed that individuals exposed to stress
had an increased risk of depression only when carrying the S allele of 5-HTTLPR, a few studies revealed
the opposite effect suggesting an interaction with the
L allele (Eley et al. 2004; Gillespie et al. 2005; Surtees
et al. 2006). In a recent publication reporting the results
from two large Australian community surveys of adolescents and young adults, Chipman et al. (2007) failed
to replicate a significant GrE between 5-HTTLPR and
recent SLE or childhood adversity on symptoms of
depression. However, using data from the Australian
Temperament Project (ATP), a longitudinal study
following child development since early infancy,
Chipman et al. found evidence that adolescents aged
17–18 yr with the LL genotype of 5-HTTLPR who had
experienced persistently high levels of family adversity were at a greater risk of depression than those
without either condition. Based on these findings, the
authors proposed that the duration of exposure to
stress might be a critical condition which may account
for the conflicting results.
A similar finding was reported by Olsson et al.
(2005) with regard to anxiety in adolescents, indicating
an increase of persistent ruminative anxiety in risk
settings with each additional copy of the L allele.
Recently, a study by Sjoberg et al. (2006) in an adolescent sample suggested that the interaction between
5-HTTLPR and environmental stress factors on depression might be sex-specific. While females with the


-----

SS genotype displayed a significant increase in depressive symptoms when exposed to psychosocial
adversity, the opposite effect was found in males, with
higher scores only in those who were carriers of the LL
genotype and had experienced adversity. Considering
the current evidence, in a most recent meta-analysis
(Munafo et al. 2008b) concluded that the effects of
5-HTTLPR and its interaction with SLE on risk of depression were negligible and positive results were
compatible with chance findings.
Given the discrepant evidence regarding the moderating effect of 5-HTTLPR on vulnerability to adverse
environments, the present study aims to further investigate GrE between 5-HTTLPR and exposure to
environmental adversity on depression and anxiety
in a high-risk community sample of young adults.
Particular attention is given to variation in genotypic
and phenotypic characteristics as well as to the duration of stressors, considering both persistent family
adversity and current SLE as potential environmental
pathogens.

and obstetric or psychosocial risks. The study was
approved by the ethics committee of the University of
Heidelberg and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Assessment


Participants

This investigation was conducted as part of the
Mannheim Study of Children at Risk, an ongoing epidemiological cohort study following the outcome of
early risk factors from infancy into adulthood (Laucht
et al. 2000). The initial sample comprised 384 children born between 1986 and 1988, of predominantly
(>99.0%) European descent. Infants were recruited
from two obstetric and six children’s hospitals of the
Rhine-Neckar region of Germany and were included
consecutively into the sample according to a twofactorial design intended to enrich and control the
status of the sample regarding obstetric and psychosocial risks (for more details, see Laucht et al. 1997).
Only first-born children with singleton births and
German-speaking parents were enrolled in the study.
Furthermore, children with severe physical handicaps,
obvious genetic defects, or metabolic diseases were
excluded. Assessments were conducted at regular intervals throughout development, most recently at
age 19 yr. Of the initial sample of 384 participants, 18
(4.7%) were excluded because of severe handicaps
(IQ or MQ<70 or neurological disorder), 39 (10.2%)
were dropouts or had incomplete data, and 18 (4.7%)
refused to participate in blood sampling. The final
sample on which complete data were available consisted of 309 young adults (142 males, 167 females).
Loss of subjects was not selective with regard to sex


To obtain psychiatric diagnoses for the period between ages 15 yr and 19 yr, i.e. between prior and
current assessment, the Structured Clinical Interview
for DSM-IV (SCID; APA, 1994; German version by
Wittchen et al. 1997) was administered to the 19-yrolds. The SCID is a widely used diagnostic interview,
for which a considerable body of reliability and
validity data has been published. Twenty-four (7.8%)
of the young adults met criteria for any depressive
disorder, and 19 (6.8%) met criteria for any anxiety
disorder. Due to the low number of clinical diagnoses
in this epidemiological study, a broad phenotype was
utilized for the present evaluation, defined as diagnosis of any anxiety or depressive disorder (n=39,
12.6%). In addition, symptoms of depression and
trait anxiety at age 19 yr were assessed by the
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck & Steer, 1987;
German version by Hautzinger et al. 1994) and the
Harm Avoidance subscale of the Temperament and
Character Inventory (TCI; Cloninger et al. 1994; German version by Richter et al. 2000), respectively. Both
self-report instruments have been used extensively in
clinical and epidemiological research and have excellent psychometric properties.
Measurement of family adversity according to an
‘enriched’ index as proposed by Rutter & Quinton
(1977) was derived from a standardized parent interview conducted at the 3-month assessment. The
index assesses the presence or absence of 11 adverse
family factors (Table 1), covering characteristics of the
parents, the partnership, and the family environment
during a period of 1 yr prior to birth (mean=1.93,

S.D.=2.06, range 0–7). Assessment of stability over a
period of >10 yr revealed coefficients of about r=0.70.
Current SLE were assessed using a modified and
shortened version of the Munich Events List (MEL;
Maier-Diewald et al. 1983). The 53-item questionnaire
asked about occurrence and threat of severe life events
and chronic difficulties in the period between the 15-yr
and 19-yr assessments. The items addressed all areas
of young adults’ lives from school and job to partner,
family, parents, living conditions, legal troubles, and
health problems. Several indices can be derived from
the MEL. For the current analysis, a total life event
score was computed which counted the number of
life events throughout the past 4 yr (mean=7.74,

Genotype analysis


Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood or
saliva with the Qiamp (Qiagen, USA) kit. The bi-allelic
LS polymorphism was amplified by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), as previously described (Heils et al.
1996). The 484-bp fragment was designed as S and
the 528-bp fragment as L, respectively. The functional
rs25531 variant which is located on this locus defines a
tri-allelic polymorphism. This is comprised of the LA,
LG, and SA alleles (the SG allele is extremely rare).
The LG and S alleles have comparable levels of 5-HTT
expression which are lower than that of the LA allele.
The 5-HTTLPR locus was amplified by PCR as outlined by Wendland et al. (2006), without multiplexing.
In a total volume of 20 ml, y25 ng genomic DNA was
amplified in the presence of 1rPromega PCR Master
Mix (www.promega.com) with oligonucleotide primers ‘5-HTTLPR and rs25531 forw.’/‘5-HTTLPR and
rs25531 rev.’ PCR conditions were: 5 min at 95 xC,
followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 xC, 90 s at 70 xC, 60 s
at 72 xC, and a final extension of 10 min at 72 xC.
Restriction was performed with 10 U HpaII for 4 h,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (www.
neb.com). Genotypes were scored according to the triallelic polymorphism LA, LG, and S alleles. To check
5-HTTLPR amplifications for dropout of the L allele,


the genotypes produced by two different sets of
primers and amplification conditions were compared.
Comparison between the protocols of Heils et al. (1996)
and Wendland et al. (2006) yielded an error rate <0.01
in 95% of the total sample genotyped in comparison.

Data analysis


t tests or analyses of variance and x[2] tests, respectively,
were performed to test differences in scores and frequencies between sex and genotype groups. Linear
and logistic regression analyses were conducted, as
appropriate, to examine whether 5-HTTLPR genotypes moderated the effect of environmental adversity
on continuous and categorical outcome measures. For
each analysis, sex was controlled for in the first step,
the main effects of genotype and adversity were entered in the second step, followed by their interaction
in the third step. To assess potential sex-specific GrE
effects, a three-way interaction with sex was entered in
the final step. Family adversity and current SLE were
examined in separate models. Results are reported for
the traditional LS classification and, additionally, for
a re-classification, based on the tri-allelic genotypes.
Therefore, the tri-allelic genotypes were transformed
into a bi-allelic model according to their level of expression as follows: LGS, LGLG, and SS were designated as S’S’, LAS and LALG as L’S’, and LALA as L’L’.
The distribution of genotypes (LL, 34.0%; LS, 50.8%;
SS, 15.2%; and L’L’, 25.6%; L’S’, 55.7%; S’S’, 18.8%)
did not deviate from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.

Results

There was a significant effect of sex on measures of
depression and anxiety, indicating higher BDI (p<
0.001) and HA scores (p<0.002) as well as higher rates
of DSM-IV diagnoses related to anxiety or depression
(p<0.002) in females than in males. Genotype groups
did not differ significantly with regard to sex, age, IQ,
family adversity, or number of SLE (data not shown).
Table 2 summarizes the findings of linear regression
models testing the effect of 5-HTTLPR genotypes and
environmental adversity on measures of depression
and anxiety in young adults. When family adversity
was examined, a significant interaction was observed
for diagnosis of depression or anxiety with regard to
both the 5-HTTLPR LS and L’S’ polymorphisms, such
that higher adversity was associated with increased
rates of disorder in LL and L’L’ homozygotes, respectively (LL: OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.21–2.22; L’L’: OR
1.64, 95% CI 1.16–2.33) but not in S allele carriers (LL:
OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96–1.40; L’L’: OR 1.20, 95% CI
0.99–1.44). Similar results were obtained for the BDI
score and the 5-HTTLPR LS polymorphism but not the
L’S’ polymorphism. Figure 1 illustrates the interaction,

and family adversity on the HA score. Furthermore,
there was a significant main effect of family adversity
on all outcome measures, with higher scores and
rates of depression or anxiety associated with increasing adversity, while no significant main effect of
5-HTTLPR genotypes and no three-way interaction
with sex were found (data not shown).
With regard to current SLE, Table 2 confirms
the presence of a significant main effect of SLE on all
outcome measures, indicating rising scores or rates
of depression and anxiety when the number of life
events increased, and the absence of any GrE with
5-HTTLPR genotypes.

Discussion


The present study aimed at further investigating GrE
between 5-HTTLPR and exposure to environmental
adversity, using different phenotypic and genotypic
characterizations as well as different types of adversity. Based on data from a 19-yr longitudinal study
of a high-risk community sample, our results demonstrate that 5-HTTLPR and adverse psychosocial conditions interact to predict patterns of mood and
anxiety psychopathology in young adults. Specifically,
we found that individuals homozygous for the L allele
of 5-HTTLPR displayed higher rates of depressive
or anxiety disorders and reported more depressive
symptoms when exposed to adversity, while no such
relationship emerged in individuals carrying the S
allele. This GrE was demonstrated for (i) exposure
to family adversity, but not to current SLE, and (ii)
depressive symptoms, but not trait anxiety.
The results outlined above are at variance with
those from numerous previous studies indicating 5HTTLPR by adversity interaction in which higher
rates of depression were observed in carriers of the S
allele who experienced SLE (Uher & McGuffin, 2008).
However, they are, in agreement with a recent report
from the ATP study (Chipman et al. 2007) which
demonstrated that adolescents homozygous for the L
allele were at greater risk of depression when exposed
to persistently high levels of family adversity, while no
evidence for GrE was obtained in individuals exposed to recent SLE or recent family adversity.
The present study can be considered as a direct replication of the ATP findings, as it shares a number of
important features with that study. Both the ATP and
our study (i) rely on data collected within an epidemiological cohort design following children during
the course of their development, (ii) use similar


measures of psychosocial adversity (in particular, of
family adversity) and differentiate between different
types of adversity, i.e. between current (episodic) life
stress vs. persistent family adversity, and (iii) examine
GrE with regard to depression in young age cohorts
at the transition from adolescence to adulthood.
The current findings parallel recent evidence of a
moderating effect of 5-HTTLPR on the relationship
between SLE and alcohol use, revealing a similar inconsistency. While Covault et al. (2007) and Kaufman
et al. (2007) found evidence for earlier and heavier
alcohol use only in carriers of the S allele following
SLE, Olsson et al. (2005) reported an increase in binge
drinking with each additional copy of the L allele in
individuals exposed to childhood adversity. The latter
observation corresponds to a number of more recent
reports indicating that carriers of the LL genotype
exhibit higher drinking activity (Bleich et al. 2007;
Hinckers et al. 2006; Hu et al. 2006; Kweon et al. 2005).
Given the high comorbidity of depression with alcohol
dependence, and of adolescent behaviour disorders
with depression and alcohol abuse, a moderating effect of 5-HTTLPR on the relationship of these disorders
with stress seems plausible.
A number of reasons may explain why some studies
offer support for a potential 5-HTTLPRradversity
interaction implicating the S allele as a risk allele,
while others found the opposite effect. One aspect that
has been largely overlooked in previous research is
the importance of a developmental perspective. The
majority of studies conducted so far have neglected
developmental issues, using subjects whose ages
spanned a wide range. Given the dynamics of genetic
influences across the lifespan, the impact of genetic
factors is likely to depend on developmental stages
(Reiss & Neiderhiser, 2000). Research findings observed across the life cycle suggest that adolescentand adult-onset depressive and anxiety disorders may
represent different subtypes. For example, most adults
with depression were found not to have been depressed as adolescents (Klein et al. 1999). Moreover,
depressed adolescents were reported to differ from
depressed adults with regard to various neurobiological correlates and treatment response, such as basal
cortisol secretion, response to serotonergic probes, and
efficacy of tricyclic medication (Kaufman et al. 2001).
Furthermore, compared to individuals with adult onset, those with adolescent onset were more likely
to have experienced unique childhood risks, such as
neurodevelopmental problems, psychopathology and
instability in their family of origin, and behavioural
problems, in particular of the externalizing spectrum,
such as antisocial and hyperactive behaviour (Jaffee


-----

et al. 2002). Another feature specific to adolescent onset
is the high comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, particularly with conduct disorder (Angold
et al. 1999). Following this line of evidence, it could be
hypothesized that depression and anxiety in young
adulthood may represent a heterogeneous phenotype,
which should be differentiated into developmentally
specific subtypes, with the adolescent-onset subtype
being characterized by a particularly high psychosocial load and more externalizing disorders.
Consistent with this hypothesis, our findings revealed a strong main effect of family adversity on
measures of depression and anxiety. Furthermore, according to additional analyses of our data, individuals
with depressive or anxiety disorders scored significantly higher on externalizing problems [aggressive
behaviour and delinquent behaviour according to
the Young Adult Self Report (YASR; Achenbach,
1991)] and were more likely to have a history of
externalizing disorders, such as conduct disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Isolating a phenotype of
adolescent-onset depression characterized by high
comorbidity with externalizing disorders is of particular importance, as several studies have provided
evidence for an association of conduct problems, aggressive behaviour and ADHD in childhood with the
LL genotype of 5-HTTLPR both alone or in interaction
with environmental adversity (Cadoret et al. 2003;
Kent et al. 2002; Nobile et al. 2007; Seeger et al. 2001;
Twitchell et al. 2001).
Further support for differentiating developmentally specific subtypes of depression and anxiety is
provided by two recent studies investigating the association with 5-HTTLPR in younger samples. In accordance with the findings of the present study, in a
sample of 247 young adult twins, Chorbov et al. (2007)
found a significant interaction between the number of
LA alleles and exposure to traumatic life events with
regard to adolescent onset major depression. In a fMRI
study assessing amygdala function, Lau et al. (2008)
demonstrated that adolescents with current anxiety
or major depressive disorder who were carriers of
the high-functioning LALA genotype of 5-HTTLPR exhibited higher amygdala activation to fearful faces
than patients with the low-functioning S or LG alleles.
This finding is at odds with those reported from affected adults, indicating greater amygdala response in
S allele carriers (Munafo et al. 2008a).
Another possible factor contributing to inconsistency may be heterogeneity in measures and characteristics of environmental adversity investigated in the
different studies. Several aspects deserve discussion in


this context, one of which is the timing and duration of
exposure to adversity. Both animal and human studies
have underscored the predisposing effect of exposure
to stress during early childhood for the development
of later mood and anxiety disorders (Heim et al. 2004).
Epidemiological studies have provided ample evidence that exposure to recent SLE is likely to precede
the onset of episodes of mood and anxiety disorders
(Kendler et al. 1999). Both early and recent adversity
have been studied in previous GrE research in humans, with the majority of studies having examined
5-HTTLPR as a moderator of the impact of SLE. Far
fewer studies have focused on early childhood adversity as an environmental pathogen. Interestingly,
several studies reporting association or interaction
with the LL genotype such as those outlined above
used indices of family adversity as measures of early
adversity. However, caution must be exercised in the
interpretation of such composite measures, as it is
difficult to separate different aspects of exposure to
adversity. In particular, several family adversity factors, such as low educational level or psychiatric disorder of a parent are proxies for persistent adverse
conditions, as reflected by the high stability found
for this index. Thus, measures of family adversity may
well confound early exposure to adversity with the
duration of exposure, a characteristic found to be
salient in the ATP study. Research on individual differences in biological reactivity to environmental
stress has highlighted the duration of a stressor as an
important determinant of the phenomenon of ‘hypocortisolism’, characterized by a suppression of the
activity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA)
axis under conditions of stress (Fries et al. 2005). This
paradoxical down-regulation of the HPA axis which
has been noted in both animal and human research is
suggested to occur after a prolonged period of hyperactivity of the HPA axis due to chronic stress. Whether
the differentiation between acute and chronic stress
may contribute to explaining the controversial findings regarding the association between 5-HTTLPR,
stress and depression, remains an interesting question
to be addressed in future research.
Sex is another variable to be taken into consideration in light of the conflicting findings. Given the
marked differences in the extent to which adult males
and females develop anxiety and mood disorders, one
possible hypothesis could be that sex-specific GrE
may contribute to this pattern. Support for this hypothesis comes from research indicating differences in
HPA axis reactivity in males and females which may
be directly responsible for higher stress vulnerability in
women (Kirschbaum et al. 1999). Accordingly, women


-----

are more likely than men to develop depression
following SLE (Cyranowski et al. 2000), particularly
with low stress exposure (Kendler et al. 2004). First
evidence for a moderating role of sex in GrE findings
was reported by a study in non-human primates,
suggesting that female animals carrying the S allele in
particular exhibited increased stress reactivity following early stress exposure (Barr et al. 2004). Consistent
with this finding, two human studies in adolescents
found an interaction with the S allele in females only
and an opposite effect, i.e. higher rates of depression in
carriers of the LL genotype, in males (Eley et al. 2004;
Sjoberg et al. 2006). However, in the present study no
significant sex differences with regard to 5-HTTLPR
GrE on depression were observed, thus failing to
provide further support for this hypothesis.
Furthermore, two methodological issues should be
considered when interpreting the discrepant findings.
Recently, an A>G single nucleotide polymorphism
within the L allele of 5-HTTLPR has been described as
a potential modulator of 5-HTT function (Hu et al.
2006), where the LG allele was associated with reduced
5-HTT expression making it functionally similar to the
S allele. Unrecognized LG alleles have been suggested
as one reason for inconsistency in previous studies. As
our GrE findings were, at least in part, dependent on
how the L allele was classified, this explanation cannot
be ruled out. However, another possible reason for
the discrepant results can be excluded by the present
study. 5-HTTLPR is known to be extremely difficult to
genotype (Kaiser et al. 2002); in a recent study, Yonan
et al. (2006) demonstrated that levels of magnesium
concentrations in the PCR reported in previous
studies caused allele-dependent non-random genotyping errors, resulting in clearly different association
findings. In our study, typing of the bi-allelic genotype
of 5-HTTLPR was replicated almost completely using
two different methods yielding a high degree of
agreement.
Finally, the present findings have to be viewed in the
light of a number of difficulties inherent in detecting
‘true’ gene–environment interactions. Major issues of
criticism relate to the multiple testing, low statistical
power, and the lack of criteria for replication. Multiple
testing has long been a serious problem in genetical research. The availability of datasets which afford
large numbers of subdivisions (due to different ways
of defining genotype and environmental characteristics) multiplies the potential of multiple testing by
offering numerous additional possibilities for data
mining (Flint & Munafo, 2008). Another difficulty in
genetic association research is that most studies are
underpowered. Since statistical tests for examining


interaction are less powerful than tests of main effects,
this problem applies particularly to studies of GrE.
The power to detect an interaction depends on a
number of conditions, including the distribution of
genotypes and environmental exposures in the sample
and the sample size. The relationship between these
conditions is complex, providing another source of
heterogeneity between results in the literature attributable to methodological reasons. Given the probable
small effects of any single GrE and the associated risk
of false-positive results, this implies a critical need for
replication. However, differences in the measurement
instruments in assessing genotype, phenotype and
environmental variables between studies may produce further heterogeneity. As long as rigorous criteria for replication studies are lacking, the GrE
literature is at risk of being flooded with false-positive
results, which are broadly described as ‘replications’
when, in fact, they are not.
Several additional limitations to our study should
be noted. First, the sample size of the present investigation is relatively small for a genetic association
study examining GrE. Since association studies are
prone to false-positive results, the results reported
here require further validation in independent samples of adequate size. However, as the present study
can be considered a close replication of the study by
Chipman et al. (2007), this limitation may be mitigated.
Second, it is noteworthy that exposure to environmental adversity, such as family adversity or SLE may
be under genetic control. Thus, the GrE observed in
this study might well be due to interactions between
5-HTTLPR and other genes that were not identified
(Plomin et al. 1994). However, as there were no
significant differences between genotypes regarding
environmental adversity, this is unlikely to be a confounder in the present study. A third limitation involves the effects of population stratification, such that
true associations may be hidden by the population
substructure. However, the potential impact of this
effect is likely to be minimal here, because all probands were selected from an epidemiological cohort
sample of a well-defined region, where 5-HTTLPR
allele frequencies in different phenotypes were largely
unbiased by geographical variation in proband characteristics. Another point of criticism may refer to
population-specific variation in linkage disequilibrium (LD). However, in view of the robust evidence of
a physiological impact of 5-HTTLPR detected in vivo
(Munafo et al. 2008a) which strongly supports a functional role of this variant, it is implausible to assume
that variation in LD may account for the reported differences.


-----

To summarize, the present study provides further evidence for GrE in the association of 5-HTTLPR
with depression and anxiety in young adults. The
finding that individuals with the LL genotype displayed more psychopathology when exposed to
family adversity confirms recent reports but is in the
opposite direction to those of various previous studies,
which demonstrated elevated rates of depression in
carriers of the S allele. Potential explanations for
the conflicting findings pertain to the need for a
developmentally specific phenotype definition and
to differences in characterizing environmental adversity.
