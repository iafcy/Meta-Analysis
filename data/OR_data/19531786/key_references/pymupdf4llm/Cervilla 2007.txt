We report results from the PREDICT-Gene case-control study nested in a prospective cohort
designed to identify predictors of the onset of depression among adult primary-care attendees.
We tested the potential gene-by-environment interaction between 5HTTLPR genotype at the
serotonin transporter gene and previous exposure to threatening life events (TLEs) in
depression. A total of 737 consecutively recruited participants were genotyped. Additional
information was gathered on exposure to TLEs over a 6-month period, socio-demographic
data and family history of psychological problems among first-degree relatives. Diagnoses of
depression were ascertained using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) by
trained interviewers. Two different depressive outcomes were used (ICD-10 depressive
episode and ICD-10 severe depressive episode). Both the s/s genotype and exposure to
increasing number of TLEs were significantly associated with depression. Moreover, the
5HTTLPR s/s genotype significantly modified the risk conferred by TLEs for both depressive
outcomes. Thus, s/s homozygous participants required minimal exposure to TLE (1 TLE) to
acquire a level of risk for depression that was only found among l/s or l/l individuals after
significantly higher exposure to TLEs (two or more TLEs). The interaction was more apparent
when applied to the diagnosis of ICD-10 severe depressive episode and after adjusting for
gender, age and family history of psychological problems. Likelihood ratios tests for the
interaction were statistically significant for both depressive outcomes (ICD-10 depressive
episode: LR X[2] = 4.7, P = 0.09 (crude), LR-X[2] = 6.4, P = 0.04 (adjusted); ICD-10 severe depressive
episode: LR X[2] = 6.9, P = 0.032 (crude), LR-X[2] = 8.1, P = 0.017 (adjusted)).

diseases has been well recognized,[14] but the technology required to explore this relationship has only
become available recently. Research on gene-byenvironment interactions can improve our understanding of the aetiology of complex diseases, such as
mental disorders by providing a more accurate
estimation of population-attributable risks for genetic
and environmental risk factors. Such research can
also contribute to the design of preventative and
therapeutic interventions for depression.[15] Over the
past 3 years, the interaction between the 5HTTLPR
polymorphism and exposure to stressful life events
has been under scrutiny. Animal research has shown
a greater likelihood of depressive outcomes in
macaques subjected to adverse rearing experiences
who carry the risk allele of the rh5HTTLPR polymorphism.[16] Moreover, imaging studies on humans
have demonstrated amygdala hyperreactivity in response to fearful stimuli among s allele carriers
compared to l/l individuals.[17]

Longitudinal data on people with one or two s
alleles at the 5HTTLPR locus indicate that they are
more vulnerable to depression than non-s allele
carriers for the same level of exposure to stressful life
situations.[12] Moreover, variations at the same locus
modify the risk effect of developing depression in
those maltreated in childhood.[12] These findings
have been more recently replicated[18–23] to include: a
population-based adult twin study in which people
with the s/s genotype were more vulnerable to the
depressogenic effects of exposure to stressful life
events;[21] research on 101 children in whom the s/s
genotype at the 5HTTLPR locus made them more
susceptible to depression when they had experienced
maltreatment and/or lack of social support[20] and a
longitudinal follow-up of 127 people over 25 years in
whom the s/s genotype was found to modify the effect
of previous exposure to adverse life events as a risk
factor for first onset of depression.[23]

Some research has been conducted exclusively in
women. Eley et al.[18] compared 377 adolescents girls
categorized by scores on the self-reported short form
of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, and found
that the risk of social environmental factors was
higher among carriers of short (s) alleles. Sjo¨berg et
al.[22] reported similar findings in female adolescents,
but showed the opposite effects in male adolescents
(i.e., male s allele carriers were less likely to develop
depression after being exposed to risky environmental
factors). There have also been two larger studies that
have failed to replicate the gene � environment interaction. The first study was conducted on an adult
cohort of 1206 twins,[24] and the other was a 1-year
follow-up of 4175 people.[25]

Overall, the strongest evidence is in favour of the
effect of an interaction between 5HTTLPR and social
distress.[26] However, to date research has been limited
by selective sample studies (i.e., children, adolescents
or twins) and the use of non-standard depressive
outcomes. There is, hence, an urgent need to replicate
these findings in large representative adult popula

tions on whom validated measures of depression
have been used. The PREDICT-Gene study tests the
hypothesis that polymorphic variation at the
5HTTLPR locus interacts with social adversity (exposure to stressful life events), modifying the risk for
depression in a Spanish population of primary-care
attendees.

Materials and methods

Design
The PREDICT-Gene study[9] is a case-control association study nested in a cohort of Spanish participants
who were part of a larger study on prediction of onset
of depression in European primary-care attendees
(PREDICT study). A detailed description of the
PREDICT study design and its method has been
reported elsewhere.[27] In brief, the PREDICT study is
a 1-year prospective study assessing consecutive
general practice attendees at 0 (time-1), 6 (time-2)
and 12 months (time-3). Only cross-sectional (time-1)
data are used in this analysis. Both PREDICT and the
PREDICT-Gene studies were approved by the relevant
research ethics committees.

Sample
Consecutive attendees to nine (two rural and seven
urban) primary care centres in the area of Ma´laga
(Spain), aged 18–75, were asked to participate
between April 2003 and September 2004. The
participant’s family doctor asked his/her patient to
take part, and time-1 interviews were undertaken by
three trained researchers within 2 weeks of informed
consent being provided. Attendees over 75 were
excluded because of higher prevalence of cognitive
impairment after that age. Participants unable to
understand Spanish, as well as those with an organic
mental disorder and/or any terminal illness, were
also excluded. This genetic study was not a part of
the original PREDICT study protocol, that aimed to
construct a predictive model of depression for use
by general practitioners. Consequently, at time-3,
further informed consent was requested to obtain a
biological sample for genetic analysis consisting of
10 cm[3] of blood and/or up to 4-mouth swabs for saliva
collection.

Independent measures
The PREDICT risk factor assessment was shown to
have adequate test–retest reliability.[27] In brief, the risk
factors for depression were either based on previously
validated measures, concerned exposures (such as
socio-demographic data) that are likely to be reported
with a high degree of reliability, or (where new
questions were developed, e.g., family history of
psychological problems and living arrangements)
were subjected to reliability testing at the outset of
the study.
Social distress was measured using the List of
Threatening Events.[28] This is a list including serious
events shown to carry high degrees of contextual

monitor the adequacy of the interview and tackle
any problems as they arose. Before transferring data to
the coordinating centre, data quality control sheets
were used and progress reports were submitted every
6 months to allow critical assessment by the PREDICT
study steering group during regular project management meetings. Ten per cent of data were double
entered which revealed an error rate of only 0.13%.

Statistical analyses
The data were analysed using the STATA 9.0
statistical package.[31] An initial exploratory analysis
was performed to study the distribution of both
independent and dependent variables. Univariable
associations were explored, using parametric or nonparametric significance tests as appropriate. Bivariable risks were estimated using classical stratified
analysis. Using a multivariable logistic regression
analysis, odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals
for depression were calculated across 5HTLPPR
genotype categories (s/s vs l/s and/or l/l) and also
across the three levels of exposure to previous TLE.
Finally, using a logistic regression model, we tested
the interaction between the genetic (5HTTLPR genotype) and the environmental (exposure to TLEs)
factors, both crudely and then after adjustment for
sex, age and family history of psychological problems
among first-degree relatives. We calculated probabilities for depression across all combinations of levels
of exposure to TLE by 5HTTLPR genotype (s/s vs l/s
or l/l). Crude and adjusted probabilities for depression across strata were also calculated. Finally, likelihood ratios tests for both differences of probabilities
between such strata and for the genetic by environment interaction were also estimated.

Results

The sample
A total of 737 (80%) out of 922 participants at time-3
gave informed consent to be included in the PREDICT-Gene genetic study and provided a biological
sample for genetic testing (n = 737). The sample’s
mean age was 49 years (s.d. = 15.2). Five hundred and
twenty-nine participants were women (71.8%) and
208 were men (21.2%). Most participants were
married or living with a partner (71%), had primary
(60%) or secondary (33.6%) schooling as their highest
educational level and were working either in (30%) or
away (30.3%) from home, whereas 15.9% were retired
and 5.2% were unemployed. 36.6% of the sample had
a positive family history of any psychological disorder amongst at least one first-degree relative.
Participants who agreed to take part in the genetic
analysis did not vary systematically, in terms of sex
(female gender: 74 vs 71%, X[2] = 0.47, P = 0.49), mean
age (49.18 vs 50 years, Student’s t = 0.87, P = 0.38),
marital status (unmarried 33 vs 29%, X[2] = 4.37,
P = 0.49) or prevalence of ICD-10 depressive episode
(35.4 vs 34.7%, X[2] = 0.021, P = 0.88), from those who
refused to give a genetic sample. Nor were there any

threat. The list includes serious life–events, such as
the death of a parent, spouse or child, the death of
another relative, the onset of a serious illness or
accident affecting a relative, a marital separation, the
ending of a friendship or relationship, a serious
problem with a close friend, neighbour or relative, a
financial crisis, the theft or loss of an item of personal
value, having troubles with the police or courts, loss
of work through redundancy and loss of work through
dismissal. Subjects were asked whether any of these
events had occurred within the 6 months before the
interview. For the purposes of the analysis, we
divided participants into three levels of exposure to
threatening life events (TLEs): Having had no TLE,
having had just one TLE or having had two or more
TLEs, over the 6-month period before the interview.

5HTTLPR genotype assays
DNA from both blood and saliva was obtained by
standard procedures. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism
at SLC6A4 was genotyped in all samples. Amplification of genomic DNA was performed using 50 ng
of DNA, 0.25 mM of each primer (forward: 5[0]-GGCGTT
GCCGCT CTG AAT GCC-3[0] and reverse: 5[0]-CAGGGG
AGATCC TGG GAG AGG T-3[0]), 250 mM each of dATP,
dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl,
10 mM Tris-HCl and 0.3 units of DNA polymerase in a
total volume of 25 ml. Samples were amplified for an
initial cycle of 8 min at 951C followed by 35 cycles
each consisting of 30 s at 951C, 30 s at 621C and 1 min
at 721C. After amplification, genotypes were resolved
by a 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium
bromide staining.

Measures of depression
Six months prevalence of ICD-10 depressive episode
(mild, moderate or severe) was ascertained using the
depression section of the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).[29] The CIDI was administered by trained lay interviewers. We tested our
hypothesis by performing two sets of analyses. In
the first, we used ICD-10[30] depressive episode of any
severity as our depression outcome, and in the second
we repeated the analyses only in those with an ICD-10
depressive episode of severe intensity.

Data quality control
Data quality was monitored to ensure that the project
yielded data of the highest validity and reliability.
The Spanish version of the PREDICT protocol was
translated from English and then back translated by
professional translators before the coordinating centre
in London finally verified no major discrepancy in
any back-translation. At a local level, each interview
was checked for completion by each interviewer, all
of whom had previously undergone a standardized
training on administering the CIDI and the risk factor
questionnaire, recruitment and interviewing of patients and data management. A Spanish research
coordinator made two assessments of each interviewer during the time-1 baseline interviews to

participants in the genetic study and those who
participated in the initial baseline assessments (mean
age 49.18 vs 49.02 years, Student’s t = 0.18, P = 0.85;
female gender 74 vs 71.8%, X[2] = 1.59, P = 0.020; being
unmarried 33 vs 31%, X[2] = 4.37, P = 0.49; prevalence
of ICD-10 depressive episode (35.4 vs 33.4%,
X[2] = 0.72, P = 0.39).

Independent variables frequencies
Demographic, genotypic and phenotypic data on the
sample are provided in Table 1. Summarizing, one in
four participants had not experienced any TLE in the
previous 6 months, and of the rest, about half had
reported at least one TLE and the other half at least
two or more TLEs. Just over a half of participants had
the l allele, whereas the rest had the s allele.
Approximately half the participants had the s/l
genotype, a quarter had the l/l genotype and the
remaining quarter had the s/s genotype (see Table 1
for details). Genotype frequencies were in Hardy–
Weinberg equilibrium, both in cases and controls.

Associations with depression
The 6-month prevalence of an ICD-10 depressive
episode was 35.4% (262) and that of ICD-10 severe
depressive episode was 25.4% (183) (see Table 1).
Table 2 shows that depression was associated with
the 5HTTLPR s/s genotype, as reported in detail
elsewhere.[9] In brief, the association between the s/s
genotype and depression was independent of age, sex,
family history of psychological problems among firstdegree relatives and GAD, but these associations were
stronger for more severe depressive episodes. Both
outcomes of depression were strongly and independently associated with previous exposure to TLE with
initial crude associations remaining robust after
adjusting for age, gender, marital status, education
and family history of psychological problems (Table
2). Conversely, depression was not associated with
marital status, professional situation, living arrangement or educational level in this sample.

5HTTLPR genotype interaction with threatening life
experiences
The 5HTTLPR polymorphism significantly modified
the risk effect for depression conferred by an increasing level of exposure to TLE (Table 3 and Figure 1).
The interaction reached a higher level of significance
when the TLE effect on depression in s/s genotype
carriers was compared with the other two genotypes
combined (l/l or l/s) (Table 3) and when only severe
depression was considered. On adjustment, age did
not modify the results and was hence excluded from
the explanatory models. Finally, the interaction was
stronger for both depressive outcomes after adjusting
for gender, age and family history of psychological
problems amongst first-degree relatives (Table 3 and
Figure 1).

the 5HTTLPR s/s genotype significantly modified the
risk conferred by TLEs for both depressive outcomes.
Thus, s/s homozygous participants required minimal
exposure to TLE (1 TLE) to acquire a level of risk for
depression, whereas l/s or l/l individuals required
higher exposure to two or more TLEs. This interaction
was more apparent for people with an ICD-10
diagnosis of severe depression and after adjustment
for gender, age and family history of psychological
problems.

Study design and limitations
A case-control study nested in a cohort study with
retrospective environmental and genetic data is an
appropriate design to examine the gene–environment
interaction hypothesis[15] However, such studies may
be limited by selection, recall and/or survivor bias. In
this study, these biases were minimized by sampling a
representative population of general practice attendees. In addition, no significant differences were
found on socio-demographic factors, and the level of
depression between the participants included in our
genetic analyses with those who refused a genetic
specimen or were lost to follow-up at time-3.[9] We did
not use the newly reported 5HTTLPR reclassification
procedure by additionally genotypying the sample
for the so-called A/G variant,[32] which may imply a
potential limitation to this study. However, some


authors have posed that reclassification of subjects
using such new polymorphism seem to render
comparable results to the well-established method
used by us.[33]

Novelty and interest
We aimed to replicate previous findings in which
variation at the 5HTTLPR locus modified the risk
effect for depression conferred by previous exposure
to stressful life events.[12,18–23] It was important to do
this as although, the earliest report on the gene–
environment interaction was conducted on an adult
sample,[12] most of the other studies were restricted to
populations, such as women but not men,[18,19,22]

younger people,[18,20,22] twins[21] or people with affective
disorders.[34] Our study used consecutive primary-care
adult attendees and hence constitutes the first
representative population-based replication of the
earliest research. To our knowledge, it is also the first
study to examine genetic-environment interaction in
a homogeneous Spanish population in whom genotype frequencies[7,10] and prevalences of exposure to
TLEs[3,28] were similar to most other European populations. Lastly, it is the first study to take account of
potential confounders, such as age, gender and family
history of psychological problems among first-degree
relatives.

in arriving at a diagnose of a depressive episode.
Consequently, we performed parallel tests using both
a broader depressive phenotype (i.e., ICD-10 depressive episode of any severity) and a narrower phenotype (i.e., only ICD-10 severe depressive episode). The
results for the gene–environment interaction are more
apparent when using the latter construct. This may
indicate that ICD-10 severe depressive episode is a
more specific depressive phenotype. It may also
suggest that there could be a linear tendency for the
reported gene–environment interaction to influence
increasingly more intense depressive states. The
definition of the depressive phenotype is crucial in
tests of the gene–environment interactions and has
been one of the major limitations of previous research
on this topic.[18,22,24,25]

The gene–environment interaction
Both crude and adjusted gene–environment interactions, on both depressive outcomes, show a nonlinear effect of the risk conferred by TLEs for
depression as a function of the 5HTTLPR genotype.
Hence, among s/s individuals minimal levels of
exposure to TLEs (from one onwards) confer a degree
of risk for depression that is only reached by non-s/s
individuals who have had higher levels of exposure
(two or more). Thus, our results show an interaction
that follows a step-wise pattern with an abrupt
change, when comparing genotypes, at moderate
levels (1 TLE) of exposure to TLEs (see Figure 1).
We believe this may be partially owing to the intense
threatening nature of the stressful life-events measured by the scale we used, where only seriously
threatening stressful life events are recorded.[28] Caspi
et al.[12] reported an interaction of 5HTTLPR genotype
with a linear progression of exposure to life events,
possibly because their measure of stressful life-events
included a wide range of situations, including those
with a lower severity and contextual threat than those
used in our measure.[35] Our results are most similar to
Kendler et al.[21] and Wilheim et al.,[23] who demonstrated
a step-wise pattern for the interaction according to the

level of threat conveyed by the stressful experiences.
Although two independent, large studies have failed to
replicate previous reports of this particular gene–
environment interaction,[24,25] their definitions of the
depressive phenotypes examined may explain their
findings. The study with the largest sample[25] used a
self-report, potentially non-specific measure of both
depression and life events. Moreover, the study was
not designed to measure risk factors for depression, but
was based on a cohort developed to investigate cancer
and nutritional problems. The second study was also
based on a self-report instrument for depression in a
study of alcoholism that was adapted to identify cases
of DSM-IV depression.[24] On the whole, our independent findings add to other positive studies that support
the notion of a true 5HTTLPR by stressful life-events
interaction first reported by Caspi et al.[12] and replicated by others.[18–23,34]

Accounting for gender, age and family history
Our results show a somewhat better model fit after
adjustment for potential confounders, such as gender
and family history. Age had little impact. The
relationship between gender and this particular
gene–environment interaction is puzzling as some
studies have reported it as valid for both
sexes,[20,21,23,34] whereas others suggest an effect only
in women[18,19] or even an inverse effect in men.[22] We
found no statistically significant differences in the
reported gene–environment interaction when women
were compared to men. Family history of psychological problems has been associated with both exposure[36] and outcome,[37] and thus should remain in
the model. The independence from family history of
our reported gene–environment interaction may suggest that there could be some specific role for the
5HTTLPR genotype (or the serotonin transporter
gene) in its modification of the risk effect for
depression conferred by previous TLEs. Nevertheless,
there is a report for a different candidate gene for
depression also interacting with stressful life experiences, although the sample studied was one of
affective disorders sufferers with no controls.[34]

In conclusion, our findings add further evidence,
from a case-control study nested in a Spanish cohort
of adult primary-care attendees, in favour of an effect
modification by the 5HTTLPR genotype on the risk of
depression conferred by previous exposure to stressful life-events.
