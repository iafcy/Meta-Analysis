In this study we investigated interactions
between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and environmental risk factors (G � E) on symptoms of depression in two large Australian community samples
of adolescents and young adults. We postulated
that a significant interaction between the
5-HTTLPR genotype and environmental risk
factors of childhood adversity or stressful life
events on symptoms of depression would be
observed in subjects with at least one short
allele (s/l or s/s) compared with subjects with no
short alleles (l/l). We did not find significant G � E
interactions between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and
recent stressful life events or childhood adversity
on symptoms of depression in our sample populations. However, we did find adolescents aged
17–18 years homozygous for the long allele (l/l)
and exposed to persistently high levels of family
adversity over a 6-year period were at a greater
risk of depression than subjects with the same
genotype exposed to no or persistently low levels
of family adversity. This interaction should be
interpreted cautiously due to the small number of
depressed subjects inthe sample with persistently
high levels of family adversity.

INTRODUCTION

The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) protein is encoded by a
gene with a functional polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in its
promoter region consisting of a 44-base pair (bp) insertion or
deletion resulting in long (l) and short (s) alleles [Heils et al.,
1996]. In vitro studies show that the long allele variant has
about three times the transcriptional activity of the short allele
variant [Heils et al., 1996; Lesch et al., 1996]. In 1996, Lesch
et al. [1996] reported a significant association between anxietyrelated personality traits and the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR
genotype in a predominantly Caucasian population.
Over the ensuing decade consistent replication of the initial
results of Lesch et al. [1996] has not been forthcoming with
subsequent published studies reporting conflicting findings.
However, results from three recent independent metaanalyses suggest that a positive association between the
5-HTTLPR genotype and anxiety-related personality traits
can be demonstrated provided an appropriate assessment
instrument is used to assess the trait [Schinka et al., 2004; Sen
et al., 2004, 2005; Schinka, 2005; Munafo` et al., 2005a, 2005b].
Furthermore, Caspi et al. [2003] have suggested that inconsistent results among studies might indicate that the
effects of the 5-HTTLPR genotype on personality and mood
are conditional on exposure to environmental risk factors.
These authors found that the 5-HTTLPR genotype significantly moderated the effect of life events on depression in
young Caucasian adults although the genotype alone was not
directly associated with depression [Caspi et al., 2003]. The
effect of stressful life events on self reports of symptoms of
depression, diagnosis of major depression, and suicidal ideation or attempt was significant in individuals with at least one
short allele (s/s or s/l) but not in those homozygous for the long
allele (l/l). The reported interaction between the 5-HTTLPR
genotype and stressful life events on depression has now been
replicated by Wilhelm et al. [2006]. In contrast, no evidence
supporting an interaction between the 5-HTTLPR genotype
and stressful life events on depression was found by Jorm
et al. [1998] and Gillespie et al. [2005]. However, interactions

between the genotype and environmental stressors on psychological outcomes have been reported by Eley et al. [2004],
Kaufman et al. [2004], Grabe et al. [2005], and Kendler et al.

[2005].
In our study, we investigated interactions between the
5-HTTLPR and environmental risk factors on symptoms of
depression in adolescents and young adults in two large
samples from the general Australian population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

PATH20 participants came from the PATH Through Life
Project, a large ongoing community survey concerned with
the health and well being of people aged 20–24, 40–44, and
60–64 years who live in Canberra, Australia, or the neighboring town of Queanbeyan. The method for this survey has been
described in detail previously [Jorm et al., 2003]. The results
reported here are from 2,095 participants (52.1% female, 47.9%
male) aged 20–24 years on 1 January 1999 who identified
themselves as ‘‘Caucasian/White.’’ Symptoms of depression
and anxiety were assessed by the Goldberg Depression and
Anxiety Scales [Goldberg et al., 1988], anxiety proneness in
response to situational cues by the Behavioral Inhibition
System component of the Behavioral Inhibition System/
Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS) scales based on
Gray’s neuropsychological theory of anxiety [Carver and
White, 1994], and neuroticism by the Neuroticism scale of the
short form of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised

[Eysenck et al., 1985]. Stressful life events experienced over
the 6 months immediately preceding interview were assessed
by a 12-item list of threatening experiences [Brugha et al.,
1985]. Childhood adversity up to the age of 16 years was
assessed by a list of 17 adversities ranging from relatively
common experiences such as mother, or mother figure,
suffering from ‘‘nervous or emotional trouble or depression’’
to rare events such as ‘‘sexual abuse by a parent’’ [Rosenman
and Rodgers, 2004]. Both recent stressful life events and
childhood adversities were divided into five groups based on
the number of events and adversities (none, one, two, three,
and four or more).
The ATP is a longitudinal study of the psycho-social
development of a representative sample of 2,443 children born
in the Australian state of Victoria between September 1982
and January 1983 [Prior et al., 2000]. The results reported here
are from a cohort of adolescents aged 15–16 years in 1998, and
17–18 years in 2000 on whom DNA had been collected for
genotyping. Relevant data were available on 584 (50.6%
females, 49.4% males) adolescents at age 15–16 years, and
544 (48.5% females, 51.5%) at age 17–18 years. While race was
not recorded, information on the total number of children in the
study for whom DNA was available showed that only one child
hada parent who was likely to be of non-European background.
The methods used in this study have been previously
described [Jorm et al., 2000]. Participating adolescents selfreported on depression using the Short Mood and Feelings
Questionnaire (SMFQ) [Angold et al., 1995]. Subjects scoring
greater than 10 were classified as depressed. The environmental risk factors for depression were the number of family
stressors reported to have a negative effect on the family over
the previous 12 months, and persistent family adversity over a
6-year period. The number of recent family stressors having a
negative effect ranged from 0 to 5 at time points 1998 and 2000.
As the number of subjects with two, three, four, or more
stressors at both time points was small, subjects were
dichotomized into those experiencing no or one family stressors
and those experiencing two or more family stressors. Family
adversity was assessed at five time points (1992, 1994, 1995,
1996, 1998) using a 6-item index consisting of unemployed
father, father in unskilled occupation, many family moves,


large family size, non-intact family, and high levels of family
stress in the previous 12 months. Subjects with two or more
items on this six-item index were considered to have high levels
of family adversity, and subjects with two or more items on the
index at two or more of the five time points were considered to
have persistently high levels of family adversity.
In the PATH20 study, the effects of the interactions between
the 5-HTTLPR genotype and environmental risk factors on
the severity of depression were analyzed by binary logistic
regression with sex being included in the models. The
dependent variable was dichotomized for severity of depression (0 ¼ Goldberg Depression Score <6; 1 ¼ Goldberg Depression Score �6). The predictor variables for the models were sex
(0 ¼ female, 1 ¼ male), 5-HTTLPR genotype (0 ¼ s/s, 1 ¼ s/l,
2 ¼ l/l), recent stressful life events (from 0 ¼ no events up to
4 ¼ 4 or more events), childhood adversity (from 0 ¼ no events
up to 4 ¼ 4 or more events), with the G � E interaction term
being the product of the genotype and the relevant environmental risk factor. All predictor variables were entered
simultaneously into the binary logistic analysis. In addition
to investigating the effect of the G � E interaction on depression we also explored the effect of the interaction on anxiety
(0 ¼ Goldberg Anxiety <8; 1 ¼ Goldberg Anxiety Score �8)
using binary regression analyses including the same predictor
variables as those used for depression. We also looked for
associations between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and symptoms
of anxiety, symptoms of depression, and anxiety-related
personality traits using analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Genotype frequencies were tested for Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium by chi-square.
In the ATP study, interactions between the 5-HTTLPR
genotype and exposure to recent family stress on depression in
the cohort at age 15–16 years (1998) and 17–18 years (2000)
wereanalyzed by binary logistic regression. In both age groups,
depression based on SMFQ score was the dependent variable
(0 ¼ not depressed, 1 ¼ depressed), and the predictor variables
were sex (0 ¼ female, 1 ¼ male), 5-HTTLPR genotype (0 ¼ s/s,
1 ¼ s/l, 2 ¼ l/l), recent family stress (0 ¼ no or one family
stressors, 1 ¼ two or more family stressors), and the G � E
interaction term was the product of the genotype and recent
family stress. Binary logistic regression was also used to
analyze the interaction between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and
longitudinal exposure to persistent family adversity (0 ¼ time
points <2; 1 ¼ time points �2) on depression. All predictor
variables were entered simultaneously into the binary regression analyses.
In both PATH20 and ATP participants, genomic DNA was
isolated using QIAamp blood kits (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany)
from buccal epithelial cells obtained using cotton swabs.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and conditions were
as described by Heils et al. [1996]. The method used for
visualization of the PCR products in the ATP study has been
described previously [Jorm et al., 2000].
Genomic DNA from some PATH20 samples was primarily
amplified using the method previously described for the ATP
study while some was amplified with Phi29 DNA polymerase
(Genomiphi DNA Amplification Kit; GE Healthcare Life
Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The primers used for PCR were stpr5 (5[0] GGC GTT
GCC GCT CTG AAT GC 3[0]) and stpr3 (5[0]GAG GGA CTG AGC
TGG ACA ACC AC 3[0]). PCR reactions mixture consisted of 20 ml
volume, using 2 ml of DNA, 2 ml of 10� PCR buffer, 2 ml of 2 mM
dNTPs, 0.8 ml of 25 mM MgCl2, 0.5 ml of 10 mM of each primer,
Taq DNA polymerase, and ddH2O to make a total volume of
20 ml. The PCR conditions were a cycle of pre-denaturation at
958C for 3 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 958C for 30 sec,
annealing at 618C for 30 sec and extension at 728C for 1 min.
Extension in the final PCR cycle reaction was at 728C for 7 min
followed by 258C for 5 min. PCR products were separated by

visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Alleles were
designated as short (484 bp) and long (528 bp) by visual
inspection in comparison with fragments of known size.

RESULTS

In the PATH20 study, the allelefrequencies in theCaucasian
population (n ¼ 2,095) were 56.1% for the long allele (l) and
43.9% for the short (s) allele. The genotype frequencies were l/s
46.3% (n ¼ 971), l/l 32.9% (n ¼ 689), and s/s 20.8% (n ¼ 435) and
were not in Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium; w[2] ¼ 7.34, df ¼ 1,
P ¼ 0.007. There was no significant difference between the
genotype frequencies in males and females. No significant
associations between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and anxietyrelated personality traits, anxiety symptoms or depressive
symptoms were observed in the ANOVAs.
No significant G � E interactions between the 5-HTTLPR
genotype and recent stressful life events or childhood adversity
on the severity of depression (or anxiety) were observed in the
binary logistic analyses. However, significant main effects
were seen for sex, recent stressful life events, and childhood
adversity on depression (and anxiety) in these analyses.
The results for binary logistic regression for the depression
outcome are found in Table I.
In the ATP study, subjects were a cohort aged 15–16 years in
1998 and 17–18 years in 2000 from a sample of 674
participants genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism.
The allele frequencies in the 674 participants genotyped for
5-HTTLPR polymorphism were 58.0% for the long allele (l) and
42.0% for the short allele (s). The genotype frequencies in these
participants were l/s 50.8% (n ¼ 342), l/l 32.6% (n ¼ 220) and s/s
16.6% (n ¼ 112), and the frequencies were in Hardy–Weinberg
Equilibrium: w[2] ¼ 1.17, df ¼ 1, P ¼ 0.279. There were no


significant differences between the genotype frequencies in
the male and female subgroups. No significant G � E interaction was observed between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and
recent family stressors on depression in the cohort when aged
15–16 years (n ¼ 584) in 1998, or aged 17–18 years (n ¼ 544) in
2000. Significant main effects were seen for sex but not for
recent family stressors or the 5-HTTLPR genotype. The results
are summarized in Table II.
However, a significant G � E interaction was observed
between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and persistent family
adversity on depression in the cohort when aged 17–18 years
(n ¼ 592) in 2000 (P ¼ 0.007), but not when aged 15–16 years
(n ¼ 568) in 1998 (P ¼ 0.215). Significant main effects wereseen
for sex but not for family stressors or the 5-HTTLPR genotype.
The results are summarized in Table III.
In the 17–18 year olds, participants homozygous for the long
allele had an approximately fourfold increased risk of depression if they had been exposed to persistently high levels of
adversity over the previous 6 years compared with those with
this genotype and persistently low levels of family adversity. In
contrast, the 17–18 year old participants homozygous for
the short allele had an approximately two fold lower risk
of depression when exposed to persistently high levels of
adversity compared with those with this genotype exposed to
persistently low levels of family adversity, while the risk of
depression in heterozygous participants was similar in those
experiencing either high or low levels of persistent family
adversity. The interaction data are plotted in Figure 1.
However, in the 17–18 year olds there was only a small
number of participants with persistently high levels of family
adversity who were depressed (s/s n ¼ 1/15, s/l n ¼ 6/46, l/l
n ¼ 7/19). The comparable numbers for 17–18-year-old participants with depression and persistently low levels of family
adversity were 12/82 (s/s), 30/252 (s/l), and 14/154 (l/l). The

overall prevalences of depression in the 17–18 year old
participants irrespective of exposure to high or low levels of
family adversity were 13.4% (s/s), 12.1% (s/l), and 12.1% (l/l).

DISCUSSION


The major strength of our study is replication of
non-significant findings for G � E interactions between the
5-HTTLPR genotype and recent stressful life events on
depression in two large geographically separate community
samples from a Caucasian population of adolescents and young
adults. These results are similar to those previously reported
from a sample of adults aged 18–79 years (n ¼ 759) from the
same geographically located population as the PATH20
participants [Jorm et al., 1998]. The limitations of our study
include the failure of the genotype frequencies in the PATH20
participants to demonstrate HWE, the absence of longitudinal
data on stressful life events, and the lower statistical power in
the ATP study to demonstrate a significant interaction
between the genotype and stressful life events if in fact one
exists.
The departure of the genotype frequencies from HWE in the
PATH20 sample may be a chance occurrence or a result of
genotyping error. All genotype results were checked independently by three people, but we cannot rule out the possibility
that all three were biased in the same way in making their
calls. Alternatively it may be due to differential amplification of
alleles during either PCR or whole genome amplification by
multistrand displacement (MDA). PCR bias does not seem
likely, as there is no indication of it in the ATP sample. MDA,


however, was performed on the PATH20 sample, but not on the
ATP sample. This procedure can lead to genotyping error for
length polymorphisms due to amplification bias [Dickson et al.,
2005]. Other explanations such as natural selection and
population mixing seem highly unlikely based on the extent
of differential mortality required in the case of the former and
the relatively homogeneous nature of our sample in the case of
the later. Although the genotype frequencies in PATH20 were
not in HWE they were similar to those observed in other
Caucasian populations [Caspi et al., 2003; Gillespie et al., 2005;
Olsson et al., 2005; Surtees et al., 2006; Wilhelm et al., 2006].
We consider that the observed departure from HWE is unlikely
to have affected our overall finding of no significant G � E
interactions in the PATH20 sample.
The findings of both Caspi et al. [2003] and Wilhelm et al.

[2006], suggest that G � E interactions between the 5-HTTLPR
and stressful life events might be conditional on the duration of
exposure to the stressors prior to the onset of depression.
Exposures to environmental stressors of 12 months or less
might be too short to result in significant G � E interactions
with the 5-HTTLPR genotype. The potential importance of
duration of environmental exposure is supported by our
findings of a significant G � E interaction between long allele
homozygosity (l/l) and persistently high levels of family
adversity over a 6-year period on depression in adolescents
when aged 17–18 years (P ¼ 0.007). However, the involvement
of the long allele (l/l) rather than the short allele (s/s or s/l) in
the G � E interaction was opposite to that which we had
hypothesized. Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with
those of Surtees et al. [2006] who reported a significant

interaction between the l/l genotype and adverse experiences
in childhood on past-year prevalent major depressive disorder
in a large sample of English men with a mean age of about
60 years. Furthermore, in our 17–18-year-old participants
there was evidence that those having the s/s genotype and
persistently high levels of family adversity were less depressed
than those with low levels of family adversity. This result
suggests that the s/s genotype in these 17–18 year olds might
have had a protective effect for the development of depression.
The finding of a possible protective effect for the s/s genotype is
consistent with that reported by Olsson et al. [2005] who found
that increasing copies of the s allele in Australian subjects aged
14–24 years had a protective effect on persistent ruminative
anxieties and binge drinking where the risk of insecure
attachments was high.
Based on a simple binary logistic regression model it is likely
that the PATH20 analysis is adequately powered to detect a
significant interaction between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and
stressful life events on depression while the ATP analysis is
likely to be underpowered. In a simple binary logistic
regression model, a sample size of about 1,300 subjects would
be sufficient to provide a power of 80% to detect a small effect
size for the G � E interaction (Odds Ratio 1.5), assuming a
prevalence of depression 15% in the population from which the
sample was drawn and an alpha of 0.05 (two-tailed).
In conclusion, our study failed to find significant G � E
interactions between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and recent
stressful life events on depression. We also failed to find
significant interactions between the genotype and recent
stressful life events on anxiety and between the genotype and
childhood adversity on both depression and anxiety in the
20–24 year olds.
