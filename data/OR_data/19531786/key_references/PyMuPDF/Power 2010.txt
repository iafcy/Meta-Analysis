Abstract
Modiﬁcation of the effect of life events on risk of depression by a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene promoter (5-HTTLPR)
has been reported in child, adolescent, adult and elderly populations. Replication attempted on data collected from 1421 individuals aged 65
and over from a French community study provided no evidence of a similar modifying effect. In the only analysis known to the authors to
be carried out in an exclusively elderly, European population, this null ﬁnding remained consistent after restriction of analysis to prevalent or
incident cases.

1. Introduction
The common, 44 bp indel polymorphism in the serotonin
transporter gene promoter (5-HTTLPR) has been found to
modify the depressogenic effect of stressful life events, with
the 5-HTTLPR “short” (s) allele of associated with increased,
and the “long” (l) allele associated with reduced, inﬂuence
(Caspi et al., 2003). This ﬁnding was recently replicated for
late-life depression in Korea (Kim et al., 2007), but has not
received further evaluation in an older community population
or one where the functional inﬂuence of a recently identiﬁed
SNP (rs25531) has been considered (Wendland et al., 2006).

2. Methods
In a French community sample of 1421 people aged 65+,
recent (within 12 months) life-events were ascertained using
a structured questionnaire and case-level depression was
assessed using the MINI and CES-D schedules (Ritchie et al.,
2004).5-HTTLPRgenotypewasassayedfrombloodsamples
and recoded according to rs25531 status (Wendland et al.,
2006). After two years, life events and depression were ascer-
tained again using identical procedures. Interaction between
life-events and 5-HTTLPR functional genotype was tested
in binary logistic regression models with prevalent depres-
sion at baseline and incident depression at follow-up as the
dependent variable.
3. Results
5-HTTLPR functional genotype and life event frequencies
at baseline were ll = 24.1%, sl = 47.4% and ss = 28.5% and

c Only individuals who were not cases according to respective measures at baseline included in analysis.
0 = 40.3%, 1 = 34.8% and 2 or more = 24.9%, respectively.
Case-level depression was present in 3.1% according to MINI
and 29.2% according to CES-D at this time. Incident depres-
sion was present in 1.9% and 11.7% of the sample according
to these instruments at follow-up. Results of the logistic
regression analyses are displayed in Table 1. Stressful life-
events were strongly associated with depression at baseline
but not at follow-up. No main effect for 5-HTTLPR func-
tional genotype or 5-HTTLPR functional genotype × life
event interaction was evident for either depression measure
or time point of assessment.
4. Discussion
Inthissampleofolderpeople,wewerenotabletoreplicate
the previously reported interaction between 5-HTTLPR and
life-events as risk factors for depression. This outcome was
unaffected by instrument used to identify depression, restric-
tion of the analysis to incident cases or use of 5-HTTLPR
genotype without reclassiﬁcation according to rs25531 (see
Supplementary material). Previously, two studies of the 5-
HTTLPR × life event interaction for depression have focused
on older participants: a European study with a 41–80 year
age-range which not did not ﬁnd an interaction (Surtees et
al., 2006) and a Korean study with over 65’s only which did
(Kim et al., 2007). One possible explanation for the differ-
ence is the greater prevalence of the 5-HTTLPR s allele in
the Korean sample (52.7% vs. 21.9% with an ss genotype),
consistent with other East Asian populations. The Korean
sample had also experienced more life events over the same
time period (71.9% vs. 59.7% with >1 life event) and had a
relatively high prevalence of the BDNF met allele that was
found to be a modifying factor (Kim et al., 2007). It is possible
that the relatively low number of risk factors leave the current
analyses underpowered to detect an interaction. Another pos-
sibility is that the interaction is risk- rather than, or as well as,
age-speciﬁc and is only apparent in comparatively high-risk
environments. Exploration of this hypothesis could involve
assessment of subjective experience of stressful events, as per
Kendleretal.(2005).The5-HTTLPR × life-eventinteraction
is an important ﬁnding which has been well replicated. Our
results suggest that, for late-life depression at least, there may
be inter-population heterogeneity that should be considered
when interpreting future studies.
