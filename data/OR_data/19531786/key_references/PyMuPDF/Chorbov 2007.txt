Several studies have implicated an insertion/
deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of
the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4; 5-HTT)
in the development of mood disorders. In the
present study of a sample of 247 young adult
female twins from Missouri, we examine whether
this polymorphism interacts with the effect of
adverse life events to increase risk for developing
depression. We found a signiﬁcant interaction
between the number of high-activity LA alleles
and exposure to trauma (OR ¼ 1.70, P < 0.0001).
This differs from previous reports, in that the
higher activity genotypes (LA/LA, LA/S, LA/LG),
rather than the low activity genotypes (S/S, S/LG,
LG/LG), are associated with an increased inci-
dence of major depressive disease (MDD) in the
presence of environmental trauma.

Relationship of 5-HTTLPR Genotypes and Depression
Risk in the Presence of Trauma in a Female Twin
Sample. Am J Med Genet Part B 144B:830–833.
There is mounting evidence implicating alterations in
serotonergic (5-HT) systems in the pathophysiology of depres-
sion. The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4, MIM: 182138)
is a prime candidate as its protein product is the target of
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) which have
been found effective in the treatment of major depression
[White et al., 2005]. Heils et al. [1996] reported that a 44 bp
insertion/deletion polymorphism (5-HTTLPR insertion/dele-
tion polymorphism) in the transcriptional control region
upstream of the coding sequence of SLC6A4 affected basal
promoter activity levels, expression levels being about three-
fold higher for the variant with the 44 bp insertion (long or L
allele) compared to the variant with the deletion (short or S
allele). Several epidemiologic and community-based studies
have implicated an interaction of this polymorphism with
environmental factors in the etiology of MDD. Relative to
homozygous L/L individuals, young adult carriers of the S
allele (S/L or S/S individuals) were reported to have increased
vulnerability to major depression when exposed to adverse
events [Caspi et al., 2003]. Eley et al. [2004] reported
signiﬁcant risk from the S/S genotype, but only for girls in a
high environmental risk group, with a nonsigniﬁcant trend for
overall association of the short allele with low depressive
symptoms groups. Another group [Grabe et al., 2005] reported
that the S allele of the 5-HTT promoter region showed
signiﬁcant interactions between genotype, unemployment
and chronic diseases in females, but not in males; there was
no independent association of the genotype with mental and
physical health. Kendler et al. [2005] found signiﬁcantly
increased sensitivity in young adults to the depressogenic
effects of stressful life events for S/S homozygous individuals
when compared to those with one or two long alleles (S/L or L/
L), a different outcome for the heterozygous class than reported
in Caspi et al. [2003]. Kaufman et al. [2006] also found
increased risk for MDD in maltreated children who carry the S/
S genotype.
As part of an ongoing study of the roles of genetic and
environmental factors and brain morphology on the risk for
MDD, we have collected information about MDD and environ-
mental stressors for an epidemiologically ascertained sample
of adolescent and young adult female twins in Missouri. The
evidence reported by others prompted us to examine whether
the interaction between 5-HTTLPR genotype and adverse life
events on MDD could be replicated in this sample.
More recently than many of the aforementioned reports, Hu
et al. [2004] found a common functional A/G substitution (SNP
rs25531) in the ﬁrst of two extra 22 bp repeats of the L allele
which generates two forms (LA and LG). Kraft et al. [2005]
reported that rs25531 is located 18 bp upstream of a 43 bp ins/
del, rather than within the insertion. However, the published
frequency of SG is less than 1% [Wendland et al., 2006] and does
not affect analysis of the 5-HTTLPR region. Investigating
expression assays in lymphoblastoid cell lines representative
of the six 5-HTTLPR genotypes, Hu et al. observed co-
dominant allele activity with low, nearly equivalent expression
for the S and LG alleles while the LA allele was associated with
high levels of 5-HTT mRNA expression. This suggests that the
S and LG alleles could be appropriately grouped when testing
for genotypic effect. It also suggests that the studies comparing
S and L alleles may merit reexamination.
Our subjects were ascertained from the general European-
American population through Missouri birth records [Heath
et al., 1999, 2002; Glowinski et al., 2003]. This prospective
study assessed female–female twin pairs born from 1975
onwards, with subjects initially assessed at 13, 15, 17, and
19 years of age. A parent (usually the biological mother) and
each twin completed separate telephone interviews using a

modiﬁed version of the Child Semi-Structured Assessment for
the Genetics of Alcoholism (C-SSAGA) to assess medical and
psychiatric history. Twins 18 years old and above completed a
10-item self-report questionnaire about traumatic life events,
including involvement in a life-threatening accident or
disaster, as well as physical and sexual abuse or neglect
[Kessler et al., 1995].
Inclusion criteria for affected twin pairs in this study were as
follows: (1) female twin pair, either mono- or dizygotic, aged
between 13 and 23 years, (2) both twins right-handed, (3) at
least one twin with a lifetime DSM-IV [American Psychiatric
Association, 1994] diagnosis of MDD, with at least one episode
of four week duration, and (4) age of onset before 18 years of
age. For the control twin-pairs neither twin could have a
personal lifetime history of MDD, no ﬁrst degree relative and
no more than two second degree relatives could have a lifetime
history of a mood disorder. Exclusion criteria for all subjects
were as follows: (1) mental retardation, (2) autism, schizo-
phrenia, Tourette’s disorder, or eating disorder, (3) major
medical illness known or hypothesized to affect the central
nervous system, (4) signiﬁcant neurological illness, (5) preg-
nancy (temporary exclusion), (6) history of a serious head
injury with loss of consciousness for more than ﬁve minutes,
(7) intraocular metallic objects, cochlear implants, pace-
makers, or other electrical, mechanical, or magnetically
activated implants, (8) alcohol or drug dependence, or (9) being
adopted. The exclusion criteria were designed to eliminate
most known causes of changes in brain structure and
conditions contraindicated for MRI. Inclusion criteria did not
require presence or absence of traumatic events.
Blood samples were available for genetic analysis for
247 female individuals: 14 twin pairs concordant for MDD,
44 discordantpairs,and63 unaffected control pairs. The average
age of onset of MDD was 16 years and the average length of the
episode was 12 weeks. Two depressed and three healthy
subjects are included without a co-twin. Mean ages at last
assessment are similar for case and control subjects (22.1 
3.2 years vs. 21.9  3.3 years; t ¼ 0.43, P ¼ 0.67). Complete
data (MDD status, genotype, exposure to trauma) were avail-
able on 227 individuals (71 with MDD and 156 unaffected).
Genomic DNA was puriﬁed from blood using standard
protocols: red blood cells lysis, proteinase K with sodium
dodecyl sulfate treatment, and phenol/chloroform extraction
using Phase-Lock Gel Light tubes (Eppendorf, Inc.). DNA was
precipitated with sodium acetate in ethanol and resuspended
in 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4 (TE buffer). DNA
concentration was standardized using absorbance at 260 nm
(UV). The available samples were genotyped for the A/G
variation in the 43 bp insertion of 5-HTTLPR. To that purpose,
we used a PCR assay to determine both the ins/del polymorph-
ism length as well as the genotype at SNP rs25531. We
designed a set of primers to amplify a 249 bp region around
the insertion (F-GCCAGCACCTAACCCCTAAT; R-AGGGGA-
GATCCTGGGAGAG). The SNP is part of a recognition site for
the MspI restriction endonuclease, which cuts one base 50 of the
SNP when the G nucleotide is present and does not cut when
the A nucleotide is present. We used the Invitrogen PCRx
Enhancer System kit for PCR ampliﬁcation. This allowed us to
avoid using 7-deazaGTP (otherwise necessary to amplify the
GC-rich region), which impairs the ability of MspI to
completely cut the PCR product. PCR followed by digestion
overnight with MspI yields a 249 bp fragment (uncut LA allele),
two fragments of 148 bp and 101 bp (cut LG allele), or a 206 bp
fragment (S allele). Fragments were separated on 2.5% agarose
gels, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized by UV
ﬂuorescence. Genotypes were determined by two independent
readers without knowledge of affection status.
We employed logistic regression to test the relationship
between genotypes, environmental history, and risk for
depression. Statistical analyses were done with Stata 9.2
(StataCorp LP). Data were analyzed hierarchically. Since few
covariates are considered in these analyses, we ﬁt all possible
models (all combinations of main effects and interaction terms)
and selected the model with the lowest associated Aikaike
Information Criterion (AIC). The cluster option and robust SE
were used to take into account the correlations that may exist
between twins, with standard errors adjusted for within-
family correlation.
Trauma data were available for 236 individuals, with 109
(46.2%) reporting at least one traumatic event. In preliminary
analyses, we ﬁrst conﬁrmed the effect of trauma on depression
risk in this sample, ﬁnding signiﬁcant associations with
trauma analyzed as either presence/absence (OR ¼ 1.72;
95% CI: 1.25–2.36; P < 0.001) or by number of traumatic
events (OR ¼ 2.03; 95% CI: 1.39–2.96; P < 0.001).
The allelic distribution in the 238 individuals who were
genotyped (S: 40%; LA: 52%; LG: 8%, Table I) is similar to that
previously observed in US and Finnish Caucasians [Hu et al.,
2006]. We did not ﬁnd any SG alleles in our sample. Observed
allele frequencies are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the
whole sample (w2 ¼ 0.81; df ¼ 4; P ¼ 0.94) as well as in the
affected and unaffected groups separately (P ¼ 0.75 and 0.89,
respectively) [http://wbiomed.curtin.edu.au/genepop/genepop_
op1.html].
We examined the relationship between genotype, trauma
and depression using, ﬁrst, the original allele classiﬁcation (S/
L) to allow comparison with previous reports that used this
classiﬁcation, and, second, taking into account the similarity in
activity levels for the S and LG alleles. In the later analyses,
genotypes were recoded as low (SS, SLG, LGLG), medium
(LALG, LAS), or high (LALA) activity (Table II).
With the ﬁrst genotype classiﬁcation, we found neither
association of MDD with 5-HTTLPR S/L (OR ¼ 1.20; 95% CI:
0.82–1.93; P ¼ 0.280) nor strong evidence for interaction
between exposure to trauma and number or presence of S
alleles (OR ¼ 1.27; 95% CI: 0.93–1.73; P ¼ 0.127). On the other
hand, when contrasting the S and LG alleles to the LA allele,
there is a marginal association between the number of LA
alleles and MDD (OR ¼ 1.41; 95% CI: 0.97–2.05; P ¼ 0.071) and
strong evidence for an interaction effect between exposure to
trauma and the number of LA alleles (OR ¼ 1.70; 95% CI: 1.29–
2.23; P < 0.0001). Association between MDD risk and the
number of LA alleles was signiﬁcant in the sub-sample exposed
to trauma (OR ¼ 1.79; 95% CI: 1.11–2.89; P ¼ 0.017; on 105
observations), but not in the absence of trauma (OR ¼ 1.21;
95% CI: 0.65–2.25; P ¼ 0.540; on 122 observations). We
checked for a multicollinearity effect between genotype and
adverse life events, but found no signiﬁcant correlation
(OR ¼ 0.82; 95% CI: 0.58–1.17; P ¼ 0.281). Whether analyzed
as an interval scale (one, two, or more life events) or as multiple
groups, we found an interaction effect of genotype and
environment when experiencing one or more adverse events

(P ¼ 0.03), but marginal evidence that additional trauma
further increases risk (P ¼ 0.054). In direct comparisons, using
the number of LA alleles in the analyses (assuming co-
dominance for the LA allele) provided a better ﬁt to the data
than alternatives (dominant: carrier of LA vs. non-carriers;
recessive: carriers of two alleles vs. others; comparisons done
with the Akaike Information Criterion).
The inﬂuence of a single adverse life event on the risk for
major depression is elevated for individuals who have one copy
of the LA allele and is signiﬁcantly greater for those with two
copies. Unlike the previous reports described above, the low-
activity genotypes (S/S, S/LG, LG/LG) are not associated with
increased MDD risk in the presence of environmental trauma.
Subjects who reported two or more stressful life events were all
at very high risk for developing MDD. Although there is a
higher prevalence of MDD for the high- and medium-activity
genotypes in this high-environmental-risk group (67% and
54% compared to 46% for the low-activity genotypes, P-values
0.007, 0.020 and 0.157, respectively), the genotype effect itself
is not statistically signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.355).
The results we obtain from our analysis of this sample of
young adult female twins differ from previous reports [Caspi
et al., 2003; Eley et al., 2004; Grabe et al., 2005; Kendler et al.,
2005; Kaufman et al., 2006] where it is the low-activity S allele
that is associated with increased risk for depression in adverse
environments. In a biological sense, it seems puzzling that
lower serotonin uptake resulting from a genetic predisposition
(the 5-HTTLPR S or LG allele) would be associated with higher
depression risk. Lowering serotonin uptake by treatment with
serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors relieves depression in
adults, and augmenting serotonergic neurotransmission by
SSRIadministration or tryptophan supplementation increases
positive mood, while an acute decrease in central serotonergic
activity via depletion of the serotonin precursor tryptophan
decreases positive mood [Flory et al., 2004]. Therefore, one
might expect that the high-activity allele (LA), with its
increased number of 5-HTT transporter proteins and con-
comitant decrease in serotonin levels, would decrease positive
mood. However, in all of the reports cited above, the old L
versus S allele classiﬁcation is used, which does not correctly
distinguish low (LG) and high (LA) activity alleles based on the
levels of transcription described by Hu et al. [2004]. It would be
interesting to know the results of a re-analysis of their samples
using the LG and LA allele classiﬁcation.
In contrast, our results suggest that the high-activity LA
allele of 5-HTTLPR is associated with elevated risk for
depression in the presence of moderate or severe trauma.
While it seems logical that higher gene expression by the LA
allele would reduce synaptic 5-HT levels and depress mood,
‘‘sensible’’ biological explanations of the moment are often
overcome as a result of the complexity revealed by additional
discoveries of interacting factors and developmental effects. In
addition to its role as neurotransmitter, serotonin acts as a
trophic factor modulating developmental processes such as
neuronal division, differentiation, migration and synaptogen-
esis [Sikich et al., 1990; Gaspar et al., 2003]. Transient
inhibition of 5-HTT in new-born mice treated with ﬂuoxetine,
a commonly used SSRI, produces abnormal emotional beha-
viors in adult mice, similar to those that lack the 5-HTT gene
[Ansorge et al., 2004]. Disrupting this ﬁne tuning of 5-HT
during development, either by genes, substances, epigenetic or
environmental factors, may lead to unexpected emotional
conditions. Given the direction of ﬁndings in the current study
of adolescent onset MDD, which is contrary to previous reports
with a different allele classiﬁcation, we note the limitations due
to the moderate sample size and realize that these ﬁndings
require conﬁrmation in larger population-based adolescent
samples.
