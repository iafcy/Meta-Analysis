Previous studies have yielded conflicting results as to the putative role of the functional
polymorphism of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) in the
etiology of anxiety-related traits and depressive disorders. Recently, a significant gene–
environment interaction was found between life stressors, the short allele of the SLC6A4
polymorphism and depression. The aim of the present study was to investigate if such a gene–
environment interaction could be replicated within a different population with a different risk
structure. A total of 1005 subjects from a general population sample (Study of Health in
Pomerania) were genotyped. Mental and physical distress were assessed on 38 items of the
modified complaint scale (BL-38). The interaction between the SLC6A4 genotype, social
stressors and chronic diseases with regard to the BL-38 score was evaluated by ANOVA. There
was no independent association of genotype with mental and physical distress. However,
significant interactions between genotype, unemployment and chronic diseases (F ¼ 6.6;
df ¼ 3, 671; Po0.001) were found in females but not in males. The genotype explained 2% of the
total variance of the BL-38 score and 9.1% of the explained variance. The results partly confirm
previous findings of a significant gene–environment interaction of the short allele, indicating a
higher mental vulnerability to social stressors and chronic diseases. The relevance of this
finding is sustained by the fact that the sample characteristics and the risk structure were
highly different from previous studies.

The SLC6A4 polymorphism of the promoter region of
the coding gene of the serotonin transporter consists
of a 44-bp insertion/deletion that is characterized by a
short
(s)
allele
with
lower
basal
and
induced
transcriptional activity and a long (l) allele with a
higher transcriptional activity of the serotonin trans-
porter gene.1–5 Given the implication of the seroto-
nergic system in the regulation of mood, anxiety
responses, aggressive behaviour, pain perception and
autonomic functions like sleep, appetite and sexu-
ality behavioural effects of this functional polymorph-
ism appear to be possible. Initial studies have found
an
association
with
the
s-allele
in
neuroticism
(increased levels of depression, hostility and anxiety)6
and harm avoidance.7 Two following studies repli-
cated8,9 these findings, others did not.10–12 Associa-
tion studies with depressive disorders also yielded
conflicting results.13 However, Neumeister et al14
demonstrated a higher susceptibility to depressive
reactions during tryptophan depletion in women
carrying the s/s-genotype. Recently, Caspi et al15
found strong evidence for a gene–environment inter-
action in a birth cohort sample of age 26 in New
Zealand. The number of life stressors was signifi-
cantly associated with higher ratings of depression in
subjects with the s/s than the l/l genotype, whereas
the s/l genotype was intermediate. Since types and
frequencies of life stressors may differ among popula-
tions, the assumed gene–environment interaction
may be difficult to replicate in different samples,
thereby questioning the validity of gene–environment
interaction of the 5-HTT polymorphism. Furthermore,
due to the numerous implications of the serotonergic
system,
a
much
broader
range
of
mental
and
physical well being could be influenced by this
polymorphism.
The aim of the present study was to verify the gene–
environment interaction of the s-polymorphism of the
promoter of the 5-HTT gene with life stressors in a

Material and methods
Sample
The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) is a cross-
sectional study of the population in Western Pomer-
ania, the north-east coastal region of Germany.16 As
being part of the former German Democratic Republic,
our general population sample had to face major
social and economic upheavals during the last 13
years. Many jobs had been lost, the rate of unemploy-
ment was about 20% during the study period, social
networks had been disrupted in many cases and, due
to the higher age of our sample, physical illnesses are
supposed to play an important role in the perceived
mental and physical distress of the sample. From the
total population of 212 157 people living in the study
area,
a
random
sample
was
drawn.
Data
were
collected between October 1997 and May 2001. The
SHIP population comprised 4310 participants (68.8%
of eligible subjects) aged 20–79 years.
In order to perform univariate analysis of variance
(ANOVA),
the
left-skewed
distribution
of
BL-38
scores (modified complaint scale from von Zerssen17)
in the total SHIP population had to be adjusted to an
acceptable normal distribution: A sample of 505
subjects with moderate and high BL-38 scores (Z58;
meanstandard deviation/2) was matched for age,
sex, marital status and education, with 505 subjects
from the total population. In all, 1005 subjects were
genotyped for the SLC6A4 polymorphism. All in-
formation was present in 976 subjects. Due to this
sampling procedure, the selected subjects were pre-
ferentially female (69.3%; w2 ¼ 177; Po0.001), had
higher mean scores in mental and physical distress
(BL-38 scores) (75.8; SD 19.7 vs 62.7; SD 13.3;
T ¼ 24.2; df ¼ 4284; Po0.001), higher mean frequen-
cies of chronic diseases (1.01; SD 1.04 vs 0.72; SD
0.71; T ¼ 8.7; df ¼ 4308; Po0.001) and a higher age
(51.6; SD 15.4 vs 49.9; SD 16.7; T ¼ 3; df ¼ 4308;
P ¼ 0.003) than the nongenotyped volunteers of the
SHIP population.
All subjects were interviewed concerning socio-
demographic characteristics, education, employment
status, health and health behaviour. Chronic diseases
were considered when present within the last year
prior to the interview. The following diseases were
evaluated: myocardical infarction, stroke, diabetes,
deep vein thrombosis, kidney disease, chronic bron-
chitis, arthritis and degenerative diseases of the joints
and spine, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis,
gastrointestinal bleedings, migraine, thyroid disease,
cancer, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease.
The diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (N ¼ 11) was
excluded from the sum score of chronic diseases
because the presence of thrombosis was near-signifi-
cantly associated with the s-allele (w2 ¼ 3.6; df ¼ 1;
P ¼ 0.06). None of the other somatic diagnoses were
associated with any genotype of the 5-HTT promoter
(P40.1). All the remaining items were summarized to
a score reflecting the overall chronic disease burden.
Assessment of mental and physical distress
The modified version of von Zerssen’s complaints
scale17–19 was used
to
assess
psychological
and
somatic symptoms by self-report on 38 items. The
presence of each symptom was rated on a four-point
scale (absent ¼ 1, mild ¼ 2, moderate ¼ 3, severe ¼ 4).
The following items were assessed: (1) back- and
lower back pain; (2) joint pain; (3) weakness; (4)
abdominal feeling of fullness; (5) faintness; (6) heart-
burn; (7) irritability; (8) nervousness; (9) heavy legs;
(10) sleeplessness; (11) dizziness; (12) fatigue; (13)
headache; (14) deafness; (15) sudden difficulty in
breathing; (16) feelings of suffocation; (17) tachycar-
dia or palpitations; (18) anxiety; (19) stomach ache;
(20) loss of energy; (21) poor concentration; (22) inner
tension; (23) sensitivity to weather; (24) depression;
(25) numbness of hands or feet; (26) globus sensation;
(27) breathlessness; (28) difficulty in swallowing; (29)
chest pain; (30) nausea; (31) rumination; (32) nervous
legs; (33) hypersensitivity against warmth; (34) hy-
persensitivity against cold; (35) excessive need of
sleep; (36) tremors; (37) neck and shoulder pain; (38)
loss of weight. The Cronbach’s alpha (0.93) indicated
a very high internal consistency of the BL-38 scale.
Social support was assessed using the five items of
the ‘tangible support’ subscale, which were rated
on a five-point scale (1 ¼ never; 2 ¼ seldom; 3 ¼
sometimes; 4 ¼ often; 5 ¼ always).20,21 The five ques-
tions covered the following domains: Do you have
someone you can talk to about personal problems,
someone who can drive you to your doctor we you are
sick, someone who prepares your meal or helps you
along with activities of daily living when you can’t do
it by yourself and someone who borrows you some
money when you are in need?
Genotyping
For genotyping, DNA was isolated from leukocytes by
standard phenol/chloroform extraction. The known 5-
HT transporter variants (s/s, s/l, l/l) located in the 50
region 1 kb upstream of the exon 1 (accession no:
X76753) were determined by PCR. DNA (0.1 mg) was
added to a final volume of 25 ml consisting of
1.5 mmol/l MgCl2, 1 U expanded high-fidelity poly-
merase
and
buffer
(Roche),
0.125 mmol/l
dNTPs
(Biozyme), 0.5 pmol forward primer 50-ATG TCC
CTA CTG CAG CCT CC and 0.5 pmol reverse primer
50-AGT CCG CGC GGG ATT C. PCR conditions were
35 cycles of 30 s at 941C, 50 s at 621C and 60 s at 721C.
A
440-
and/or
396-bp

was
generated,
respectively, and genotypes were distinguished by
size on a 2% agarose gel using a Kodak digital imager.

tests. Univariate analyses of variance were calculated
with the mental and physical distress score (BL-38) as
dependent variable and the genotype, the status of
employment (unemployed vs employed) and the
number of chronic diseases (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or more)
during the last year as independent variables. Covari-
ates were age and social support. Another covariate
covering the educational status (eight levels with
increasing quality of education) was omitted from the
analyses
because
of
its
insignificance
(females:
F ¼ 0.03; df ¼ 1, 673; P ¼ 0.96; males: F ¼ 1.4; df ¼ 1,
298; P ¼ 0.24). None of the gene–environment inter-
actions were influenced by the variable education.
The analyses were calculated separately for males and
females. In order to increase the statistical power, a
combined analysis of genotypes (s/s and s/l together
vs l/l) according to the hypothesis was performed.
Results
The percentages of the SLC6A4 genotypes were
s/s ¼ 15.4%, s/l ¼ 48.5%, l/l ¼ 36.1% in females and
s/s ¼ 17.9%,
s/l ¼ 43.7%,
l/l ¼ 38.4%
in
males
(w2 ¼ 2.3; df ¼ 2; P ¼ 0.32). The distribution of the
genotypes
was
in
Hardy–Weinberg
equilibrium
(w2 ¼ 0.14, P ¼ 0.93). Table 1 shows the distribution
of the independent variables in females and males in
the study sample.
In females, low social support (F ¼ 11.8; df ¼ 1, 673;
P ¼ 0.001) and chronic diseases (F ¼ 10.1; df ¼ 4; 670;
Po0.001) were associated with high mental and
physical distress. Unemployment (F ¼ 2.9; df ¼ 1,
673; P ¼ 0.09) and the 5-HTT genotype (s/s and s/l
vs
l/l)
(F ¼ 0.7;
df ¼ 1,
673;
P ¼ 0.39)
were
not
independently associated with mental and physical
distress in females. Significant effects of interaction
between the genotype and unemployment (F ¼ 4;
df ¼ 1, 673; P ¼ 0.047) (Figure 1), the genotype and
chronic
diseases
(F ¼ 4.6;
df ¼ 4,
670;
P ¼ 0.001)
(Figure 2) and between the genotype, unemployment
and chronic diseases (F ¼ 6.6; df ¼ 3; 671; Po0.001)
emerged.
The
equation
including
the
genotype
explained 22.8% of the total variance of the BL-38
score (adjusted R2 ¼ 0.228). When omitting the geno-
type
from
the
equation,
the
explained
variance
decreased to 20.9%.
In males, only the variable ‘chronic diseases’ were
significantly associated with impaired mental and
physical well being (F ¼ 6.8; df ¼ 1, 298; Po0.001).
Unemployment (F ¼ 2.9; df ¼ 1, 298; P ¼ 0.09), age
(F ¼ 3.8;
df ¼ 1,
298;
P ¼ 0.05),
social
support
(F ¼ 0.05; df ¼ 1, 298; P ¼ 0.82) and the genotype
(F ¼ 0.01; df ¼ 1, 298; P ¼ 0.9) did not attain statistical
significance. None of the interactions between the
genotype
and
the
variables
unemployment
and
chronic diseases were significant (P40.3). The model
explained 18.1% of the total variance of the BL-38
score.

Discussion
The s-allele of the 5-HTT promoter region showed an
interaction with life stressors in females but not in
males in our sample. There was no independent
association of the genotype with mental and physical
health. These results provided partly support to the
study of Caspi et al,15 who investigated 847 subjects
from a birth cohort study at the age of 26 in New
Zealand and found a significant interaction between
the s-allele, life-stressors and depression.
The risk factors for mental and physical distress
were a priori chosen from the data set of the Study of
Health in Pomerania16 and represent relevant stres-
sors especially in a population with a mean age of 52
years (SD 15 years). It is important to note that our
general population sample had been investigated after
it had experienced an 8–11-year period of a hitherto
unknown social and economic decline that com-
menced with German reunification and is still on-
going. As a consequence
of this socioeconomic
upheaval, a great deal of jobs vanished whereas, at
the same time, the previously tightly woven social
networks have gradually dissolved. Additionally, the
study region has also undergone dramatic demo-
graphic changes with older—and consequently also
much sicker—people making up for an ever greater
proportion of a steadily diminishing whole popula-
tion. It may therefore come to no surprise that chronic
disease was highly associated and unemployment
was modestly associated with mental and physical
distress in males and females, whereas social support
only emerged as a
strong predictor variable in
females, pointing to gender-specific risk factors for
mental and physical distress.
The self-rating questionnaire captures a broad range
of mental and physical distress corresponding to a
general health concept. Our results underscore the
circumstance that the gene–environment interaction
modulates not only symptoms restricted to depres-
sion but also a much broader range of mental and
physical symptoms. However, this is not very surpris-
ing given the fact that the serotonin system is
supposed to modulate many functional areas like
mood, anxiety, sleep, appetite, sexual and somato-
sensory
(eg
pain)
functions.
Moreover,
the
very high internal consistency in which all 38
items of the questionnaire are statistically highly
intercorrelated also emphasizes the entity of the
assessed symptoms as a broad dimension of perceived
distress.
The genotype variable explained 2% of the variance
of the BL-38 sum score in females. This means that,
besides other known and unknown environmental,
biological and psychological factors that contribute to
the development of mental and physical symptoms of
distress, the s/l-polymorphism of the 5-HTT increases
(s-allele) or relatively decreases (l-allele) the overall
load of symptoms to some degree. Given that only
22.8% of the total variance of the BL-38 score could
be explained by all independent variables in the
equation, the 2% explained variance due to the
genotype seems relatively high.
Some further issues and limitations of the study
need attention:
1. The selection of psychosocial and other risk factors
and the method of assessment represent always an
explorative approach to a complex system and
might differ among populations.
2. In our sample, medical risk factors were strongly
associated with impaired mental and physical
health, and did significantly interact with the s-
allele in females. However, the selection of the
diseases was a priori given by the design of SHIP.
Results might have been different if diseases were
assessed with an alternate spectrum of diagnoses or
with other groups of diagnoses, for example,
assessing joint related diseases not on one but on
two items like arthritis of the major joints and
chronic degenerative disease of the spine.
3. The interaction between the s-allele was found in
females but not in males. A different psychosocial
risk structure in males may contribute to the
finding. Thus, a gene–environment interaction
might emerge when assessing different risk factors
in
males.
Moreover,
a
gender-specific
genetic
vulnerability also could contribute to this find-
ing.22 The male sample was smaller than the female
sample; thus, a lack of statistical power may have
contributed to the negative finding.
4. Our sample comprised subjects on a wide spec-
trum of BL-38 scores, also including relatively
more subjects with high BL-38 scores than in the
primary SHIP sample (n ¼ 4310). This led to a
much higher standard deviation and higher means
of the BL-38 score in the genotyped sample.
Though this sampling procedure was deliberately
chosen, it might have influenced the statistical
results.
Analyses including psychosocial stressors, physi-
cal stressors, biological factors and genotypes may
help to approach multidimensional interactions as
might occur in complex diseases, and may help to
quantify the effects of various risk factors. Further
analyses on gene–environment interaction of the
functional polymorphism of the serotonin transporter
gene are warranted and should, due to the relevance
of serotonin for platelet aggregation,23,24 be extended
to atherosclerosis.25,26
