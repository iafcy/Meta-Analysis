Mean weight-for-age Z score at year 2 was higher in
children in the nutrition and combined water, sanitation,
handwashing, and nutrition groups than the mean of
–0·72 (SD 1·01) in the active control group (table 4).
Children in the active control group were close to
WHO standards for weight-for-length Z score; however,
weight-for-length Z score at year 2 was higher in the
combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition
group (table 4). There were no differences in mean head
circumference for age Z score at year 2 between children
in any of the intervention groups and those in the active
control group. Results were similar at year 1, with the
exception that differences in mean weight-for-length
Z score between the active control and two groups with
the nutrition intervention appear to have been numerically
larger at year 1 (appendix p 15).
Compared with the active control group, a smaller
proportion of children in the combined water, sanitation,
handwashing, and nutrition group were stunted (too short
for their age; –5·4 percentage points [95% CI –9·4 to –1·4]),
severely stunted (–2·7 percentage points [–5·1 to –0·2]), or
underweight (–3·0 percentage points [–5·4 to –0·6];

outcomes. Notably, there were no significant differences
between the combined water, sanitation, handwashing,
and nutrition and nutrition groups for any growth
outcomes. 1% of active control children were wasted and
the proportions were similar across all groups.
Differences in growth outcomes between the active sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition group; none of
