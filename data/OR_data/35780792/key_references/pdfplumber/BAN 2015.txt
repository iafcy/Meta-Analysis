Abstract
Objective To assess the effectiveness of multiple cleaning and disinfection interventions in the homes
and kindergartens, in reducing gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses of children.
Methods From October 2010 to September 2011, we performed a prospective, controlled study in
China. 408 children under 5 years old were recruited and group randomized into intervention and
control groups. Families and kindergartens in the intervention group were provided with antibacterial
products for hand hygiene and surface cleaning or disinfection for one year. Each child’s illness
symptoms and sick leave were recorded every day.
Results A total of 393 children completed the study, with similar baseline demographics in each of the
2 groups. Except for abdominal pain, the odds of symptoms (fever, cough and expectoration, runny nose
and nasal congestion, diarrhea), illness (acute respiratory illness and gastrointestinal illness), and sick
leave per person each month were significantly reduced by interventions. The rates of fever, diarrhea,
acute respiratory illness, gastrointestinal illness and sick leave per person per year were significantly
decreased as well.
Conclusion Not only the acute respiratory and gastrointestinal illness but the sick leave rate in
children were significantly reduced by multiple interventions.
