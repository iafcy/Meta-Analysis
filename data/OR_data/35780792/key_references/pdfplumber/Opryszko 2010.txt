is evidence that suggests that Clorin use spread across the

may have been impacted by ongoing marketing of Clorin
as well as improved water vessels that occurred in the

posters in local bazaars. However, Clorin’s effectiveness
may have been compromised by the use of turbid water.
Household filtration, through cloth or other means, prior
