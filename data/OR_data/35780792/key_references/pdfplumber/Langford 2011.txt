Objective: We conducted a longitudinal study to assess the impact of a hand-washing intervention on growth and
biomarkersofchildhealthinNepalislums.Thisisthefirststudytoevaluatetheimpactofhand-washingonmarkersof
subclinical,asymptomaticinfectionsassociatedwithchildhoodgrowthfaltering.
Methods: We recruited a total sample of infants in the target age-range (3–12 months) living in the eight largest
Kathmanduslums,allocatingthemtointervention(n545)andcontrol(n543)groups.Ininterventionareas,asmall-
scale community-based hand-washing program was implemented for six months; in control areas, mothers continued
their normal practices. Time series linear regression was used to assess the impact of the intervention on levels of
morbidity,mucosaldamage,immunestimulationandgrowth.
Results:Asexpected,childrenwithhigherlevelsofmucosaldamageexhibitedworsegrowthovertheperiodofthe

Our data therefore appear to suggest that while hand-
washing can reduce more severe forms of infection that
result in diarrheal symptoms, it may have little or no

perhaps not long enough to detect the full impact of
changes in hand-washing practice. However, any reduc-
tion in achild’sexposure to pathogenic organisms should
lead to a fairly swift reduction in immune stimulation
and, in the absence of further pathogenic damage, muco-
sal crypt cells might be expected to regenerate within a
