Diarrhea has been recognized as a frequent health problem among children
enrolled in day-care centers. Thus, we evaluated the effect of a handwashing
program In two day-care centers (HWC) on the incidence of diarrhea among
children when compared to children In two control centers (CC). After the
program was begun, the Incidence of diarrhea at the HWC began to fall and
after the second month of the study was consistently lower than that at the
CC. The incidence of diarrhea in the HWC was approximately half that of the
CC for the entire 35-week study period. Adenovlruses, rotavirus, Glardla lamblla,
and enteropathogenic Eschehchla coll were found In the stools of a small
number of ill children, but no pathogen was Identified In the stools of most
children with diarrhea. These results suggest that a handwashing program
will probably prevent at least some of the diarrhea in day-care centers.
