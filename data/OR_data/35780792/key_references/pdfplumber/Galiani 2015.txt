at critical junctures during the day. Therefore, the main challenge is to find an efficient way to bring about a
behavioral change towards better hygiene practices. This paper documents a study of a large-scale
handwashing promotion campaign carried out in Peru between 2008 and 2010 that introduced an innovative
mix of communication strategies designed to induce handwashing with soap at critical points in time. Efforts

a ‘nudge’2 by giving people information about the positive (and usually underestimated) effects of
handwashinghabits and achieving a behavioral change towards increased handwashing at critical times.

at critical points in time. The results of this evaluation show that these community district-level interventions
were effective in reaching the targeted audience with handwashing promotional messages. The community-
leveltreatedgroupwas19.4%morelikelytoreporthavingreceivedtheinterventionmessagesthroughatleast
one communication channel than the control group. Handwashing campaigns and promotional events at the
community level and one-to-one activities seemed to have successfully communicated the importance of
handwashing with soap. Not only did the message reach the treated population but it also brought about a
6% improvement in caregivers’ knowledge about the best way to wash hands and increased the availability
of soap and water in the household by 8.4%. These improvements led to a statistically significant increase in
self-reported and observed handwashing with soap before food contact as compared with the behavior of the
control groups. However, this change in behavior didnot translate into better child health. No significant im-
pactwasfoundonparasiteorbacterialprevalenceinstoolsanddrinkingwater(respectively);thisisconsistent
with the finding that there were no treatment effects in terms of diarrhea, nutrition or anemia.3
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the program components. In Section 3, we
explain the experimental design. Section 4 describes relevant issues concerning the data and sampling proce-
dure. Section 5 describes the results of the baseline balance checks and of the panel sample attrition.
Section 6 describes the methodological framework. In Section 7, we present and interpret the main results of
the study. Section 8concludes.

3. EVALUATION DESIGN
We carried out a controlled randomized trial at the district-level while taking into consideration the general
community treatment and its school component. The targeted areas were districts with populations ranging
from 1500 to 100,000 inhabitants. Figure 1 illustrates the experiment’s design. From the 1937 provinces, 40
wererandomlyselectedtoparticipateintheevaluationofthedistrict-levelinterventions.Fromtheseprovinces,
85districts(withbetween1500and100,000inhabitants)wererandomlyselected,with44randomlyassigned

group.8 In addition, for the 44 districts that were randomly assigned to the community treatment, the main

4.1. Variables of interest and measurement
Datawerecollectedfrom differentsources.First,acomprehensive household surveywasconducted thatpro-
vided information on dwelling characteristics, household assets, education, income, labor outcomes, water
sources, sanitation, and toilet and handwashing facilities, and so on (see the online Appendix 1 in Galiani
et al. (2014) for the complete list). Also included were questions on exposure to handwashing campaigns,
determinantsofhandwashingbehavior—handwashingknowledge,beliefs,andaccesstoandplacementofsoap
and water—and caregiver self-reported handwashing behavior. To complement the handwashing behavior
module, structured observations, during which a family’s handwashing behavior within the household was
observedforaperiodlastingfrom4to5h,wereconductedonanotherdayfollowingthesurvey.10Inaddition,
inordertomeasureenvironmentalcontamination, drinkingwatermicrobiologysampleswerecollectedinside
the households at the time of the survey and analyzed in the field using a membrane filtration technique to
determine the presence of Escherichiacoli and other types of coliforms.
Wewereinterestedinsymptomsdirectlyorindirectlyrelatedtopoorhandwashinghabits.Weaskedabout
diarrhea and Acute Lower Respiratory Infections(ALRI)prevalencein the last 48hand in the last week and
illnesses mainly transmitted through the hands. We also performed anthropometric measurements of children
following standard international procedures. An assessment of the presence of intestinal parasitic infestations
in children was achievedthrough a laboratory analysis of children’s stools. Parasitic infestations pose serious
threats to young children’s health because the associated diarrhea and micronutrient malnutrition often lead
to iron-deficiency anemia.11 We therefore also measured anemia in children between 6 months and 5 years
of age.
4.2. Descriptive statistics
Peru is a middle-income country with an estimated per capita income of $US5195 in 2010. Peru has a high
human development index score of 0.725 based on 2011 data (the average index for Latin America and the

Caribbean is 0.731 and for the world is 0.682). One-third of the population is poor (31.3%), and 9.8% is ex-
tremely poor. The wealthiest region of the country is Lima, Peru’s capital city, which is excluded from this
study. The mean years of schooling for adults older than 25 is 8.9. Most children attend school (93% attend
primary school, and76% attend highschool) according to 2010 data.

In60%ofthehouseholds,ahandwashingfacility—adesignatedplaceforhandwashing—stockedwithsoap
and water was observed within the dwelling or the yard. The higher the income, the closer the handwashing
station was to the toilet or kitchen facility. In all, 44% of the caregivers appeared to have clean fingernails,
andapproximately56%hadcleanhandsorfingerpads,whereas66%ofthechildrenlookedcleanatfirstsight,
but 55% had dirty fingernails. Households with access to improved sanitation and water sources had lower
counts of bacteria in their drinking water. When accounting for income levels, there was a declining trend of
E.coli counts with increased income.12
Parasitological analysis shows that, on average, parasites were detected in 15% of the stool samples col-
lected from children under 2 years of age (the most frequent were Giardia and Blastocystis). The prevalence
of parasites was lower among households with access to improved sanitation (9%) and water (14%) than
those with unimproved sanitation (20%) or unimproved water (21%). The lowest prevalence of parasites
was found in households with a handwashing station stocked with soap and water (8%) and highest in those
without (25%).

householdsallocated to each treatment with the householdsof the corresponding control groups.
Theproportionofunbalancedvariablesforthetreatmentandcontrolcomparisonforthedistrict-levelinter-
ventionwasinlinewiththelevelsconsideredacceptableinrandomizedtrials.Furthermore,thedifferencesbe-
tween treatment and control groups go in either direction without any clear pattern.
5.2. Attrition analysis
Our surveys records show an overall attrition rate of 20% after 3years, in line with similar randomized stud-
ies.14Inadditiontothefactthatthesampleissmaller,whenattritionissystematicallyrelatedtotheoutcomes
under study or to the program itself, it mayskew the estimates of the causal effects of the interventions.
Toaddressthispotentialproblem,wefirstshowinOnlineAppendix3inGalianietal.(2014)thatthepro-
portion of households that stayed in each group ranges from 0.72 to 0.804, and we cannot reject the null hy-
pothesis of equal levels of attrition for the control and treatment groups at conventional significance levels in
any of the samples studied.
Thefactthattherewasnodifferentialattritioninthetreatmentandcomparisongroupsisconsistentwiththe
hypothesisthatattritioncouldbeignorable,anditsuggeststhattheestimateofthetreatmenteffectswillnotbe
biased unless different types of households dropped out of the sample in the treatment and the comparison
groups.15 Baseline balance was achieved for the entire initial sample in most of the variables, and in Online
Appendix3inGalianietal.(2014),wecanseethatthesampleofnon-attritersisalsowellbalancedatbaseline.
Thisimpliesthatthoseremaininginthesampleandtheattriterswerestatisticallybalancedintermsofobserv-
able characteristics.
To make up for the loss in sample size due to attrition, we included 688 new households in the follow-up
surveytoreplacehouseholdsthathaddroppedout.Notethatthisposesnoproblemsolongastheintervention
isatthearealevelratherthanattheindividuallevel,assumingthatattritionisstatisticallyignorable.Toconfirm
that the characteristics of the replacement households in the treatment and control groups were balanced, we
selected 32 variables that were presumably independent of the treatment and affected by more structural pat-
terns.Inmostofthesecases,wecouldnotrejectthenullhypothesisofequalityofmeansatconventionalsig-

7.1. Exposureto handwashing promotion
The Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project in Peru uses a behavior-change approach. Thus, we asked
mothers and caregivers whether they had received handwashing promotional messages during the past 12
months through any of the three channels used by the intervention: radio and printed materials, promotional
events, and educational sessions.

othercommunity-levelactivities.TableIshowsthattheschoolcomponentincreasedtheprobabilityoflowex-
posure to the treatment (that is, receiving the messages through only one channel) by8.9%.
7.2. Treatment effects on handwashingdeterminants
Inorder to improve handwashing behavior, thefactors thatmotivatethat behaviorhaveto bechanged.These
factors are known as handwashing determinants, and they include knowledge about the best way to wash
hands, beliefs about whether soap is needed for effective handwashing, and the availability and placement of
soap and water. Caregivers were asked about their knowledge of effective handwashing habits as well as the
availabilityofwaterorsoapinthehousehold.Thiswouldconstitutethesecondlink—afterexposuretoinfor-
mation—in determiningwhether the project couldtrigger a behavioral change.
TableIIalsoshowsthatthedistrict-levelinterventionsnotonlyincreasedexposuretothetreatmentbutalso
enhanced the knowledge of mothers and caregivers regarding handwashing practices. For instance, in the
treated districts, there was a significant increase (around 5%) in the proportion of respondents who answered
thatthebestmethodforwashingtheirhandswastousewaterandsoap.Inaddition,themembersof3.3%more
households in the treated districts knew that insufficient handwashing is the main cause of diarrhea.19
Itisimportanttonotethatthemeanofthecontrolgroupfortheseknowledgevariablesishigh:88%ofthe
caregivers answered that the best method for washing hands is with water and soap, and 94% of the inter-
vieweesclaimedthatimproperhandwashingisthemaincauseofdiarrhea.Thesevariablesreflectafairlymod-

reducedby42%,andthegapregardingtheinfluenceofimproperorinsufficienthandwashingasacauseofdi-
arrhea was reduced by 50%).20
Finally, the community treatment increased the availability of water and soap in households by 8.4%
(among the school component sample). Again, it is worth mentioning that the level of availability of soap
and water anywhere in the dwelling was also quite high in the control group (e.g., 77% of the households in
the control group for the school component of the community treatment have water and soap somewhere in
the dwelling). Thus, the treatment reduced the gap by 28%, which constitutes remarkable progress.
7.3. Treatment effects on handwashingbehavior
The next step in the causal chain is to assess whether the improvements in knowledge about the benefits of
handwashingandtheavailabilityofwaterandsoapbroughtaboutbythecommunitytreatmenttranslatedinto
behavioral changes in handwashing. Ideally, multiple methods should be used to obtain a more reliable mea-
surement of true handwashing behavior because respondents tend to over-report their behavior if they think

Observations of handwashing facilities were conducted in all households. The mother or caregiver was
askedtoidentifytheplace(s)inthehouseholdthatweredesignatedforhandwashingafterfecalcontactorbe-
fore food contact. When the answer was positive, the enumerator noted all the details about the handwashing
facility(type,distancefromthetoiletorkitchen,availabilityofwaterandsoap,andtypeofsoap).Atbaseline,
the proportion of households with at least one handwashing facility near the toilet or kitchen was quite high
(66%). The community treatment increased the share of households with handwashing facilities by 4.9%
(9.2%fortheschoolcomponentsample),buttheincreasewasnotstatisticallysignificantatconventionallevels.

a positive and significant effect on the cleanliness of mothers’ hands, as the treatment group was 3.6% more
likely to have clean hands thanthose in the control group.
Self-reported handwashing behavior was measured by asking mothers and caregivers under what
circumstances they had washed their hands with soap in the previous 24 h. Respondents were asked to
recall every time that they had used soap during handwashing. Analysis of the responses focused on
self-reported handwashing-with-soap behavior during any of the critical junctures. As Table III shows,
self-reported handwashing-with-soap behavior improved in the district-level interventions at almost all
the critical junctures, but it was statistically significant only in the school treatment. Among the school
component sample, 23.6% more respondents in the treatment group reported having washed their hands
with soap before eating, and 27.8% more reported having washed their hands with soap before feeding
a child, relative to the control group.

Medical evidence suggests that the transmission of diarrhea and respiratory infections occurs mainly through
people’s hands. It is expected that people who wash their hands with soap at key junctures will have fewer

8. CONCLUSION
Changing handwashing behavior is a complex phenomenon involving personal habits that has multiple (eco-
nomic,cultural,social,etc.)determinants.25Thispaperfocusesonalarge-scalehandwashingpromotioninter-
vention that took place in Peru between 2008 and 2010 and that introduced an innovative mix of
communication strategies to induce handwashing with soap at critical points in times. The study examined
the effect of two different district-level treatments—a community treatment and an additional school compo-
nent—onseveraloutcomes:exposuretotheprogram,handwashingdeterminants,handwashingbehavior,en-
vironmental contamination, andchild health.
Thecommunityinterventionthathasbeenstudiedhereprovedtobeeffectiveinreachingthetargetedaudi-
ence with its handwashing promotion message, and it significantly increased the proportion of mothers and
caregivers who reported receiving it. The treated community group reported receiving the message through
atleastonecommunicationchannelmorethan15%moreoftenthanthecontrolgroupdid.Thismorecompre-
hensivetreatmentseemstohavesuccessfullytransmittedthekeymessagesrelatedtohandwashingwithsoap.
Increased exposure to the campaign and educational sessions translated into observable learning about best
handwashing practices. This improvement in knowledge led, in turn, to statistically significant behavioral
changes in key areas, such as an 8.4% increase in the availability of water and soap in the household, hand
cleanliness, and observed and caregiver self-reported handwashing behavior before eating, feeding a child,
and preparing food. In addition, observed handwashing with soap increased among the treated households
by61%beforeeatingandby69%beforepreparingfood,ascomparedwiththecontrolgroups.However,these
behavioral changes did not translate into better child health. Overall, no impact was found in terms of the

the fact that there were no effects on the incidence of diarrhea, micronutrient malnutrition, or anemia.
The results of this evaluation indicate that more intensive interventions that, in addition to mass media
promotional methods, include more personalized treatments (in this case, community activities and changes in
school curricula) are effective in reaching target audiences and increasing the knowledge of mothers and care-
giversabout the benefitsofhandwashingwithsoap.Furthermore, thereisevidenceofbehavioral changeinre-
gard to certain variables as measured by self-reported behaviors and structured observations. This is a step
forwardincomparisonwiththereportedachievementsofothermassmediacampaigns(e.g.,theworkofBabor
