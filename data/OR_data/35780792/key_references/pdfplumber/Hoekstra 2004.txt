Abstract. We introduced home drinking water disinfection and handwashing with soap in Karachi squatter settle-
mentstoevaluatetheireffectondiarrhea.InApril2000,150householdsreceivedsoap,76receiveddilutebleachand
a water storage vessel, and 76 were enrolled as controls. In 2000, among households wealthy enough to own a refrig-
erator,childreninhouseholdsthatreceivedbleachandavesselhada73%lowerincidenceofdiarrheathancontrols;
those that received soap had a 56% lower incidence. There was no reduction in diarrhea in intervention households
withoutarefrigerator.In2001,householdsthatreceivedbleachandavesselhada71%lowerincidenceofdiarrheaand
children in households that received soap had a 35% lower incidence than controls. In 2001, the interventions were

were ultimately effective in preventing diarrhea, but only households of slightly higher socioeconomic status changed
