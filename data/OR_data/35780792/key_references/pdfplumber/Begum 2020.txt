Abstract
Diarrhea is a leading cause of death among under five children in developing countries. The burden of child diarrhea in
Bangladesh is still significant. Safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) can limit the events. This study aimed to assess
theeffectivenessofWASHeducationofmothersorcaregiversonchilddiarrhea.Acommunity-basedrandomizedcontroltrial
