Abstract. This study has demonstrated that additional training of service providers [village health
volunteers (VHVs), village health communicators (VHCs)] in combination with the mobilization of vil­
lage leaders and influentials to promote selective preventive health behavior, can have a marked impact
upon the effectice practive of these behaviors and diarrheal incidence. Further, this impact can be achieved
through the existing staff structure, ie, VHVIVHCs of the national health program. For example, increased
contact between these service providers and mothers of children under 5 years through home visits and
attendance at meetings held by the service providers, contributed positively to the practice of selected
preventive behaviors. If the national program provided similar training inputs on the promotion of selected
preventive behaviors and increased service provider contacts, the program's impact upon diarrheal disease
would be enhanced.
