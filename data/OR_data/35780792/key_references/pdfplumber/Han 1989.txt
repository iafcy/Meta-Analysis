intervention started at the begin&g of August, and
from Septembert he diarrhoeal incidence in the HWH
was sign&antly lower than that in the CH through-
out the intervention period. However, there was little
difference in the dysentery incidence in the 2 groups.
Discussion
The risk of diarrhoeal pathogens spreading from
caseso r carriers to susceptible children within fami-
lies or day-care centres is increased by poor hygienic
practices (AUNG MYO HAN et al., 1986; BLACKe t al.,
1977). To interrupt this transmission, proper hand
washing with soap and water has been shown to be
effective (BLACK et al., 1981; KHAN, 1982; TORUM,
1982; STANTON & CLEMENS, 1987). Our study also
found that hand washing intervention was effective in
reducing the incidence of diarrhoea. The diarrhoeal
incidence rates were significantly reduced in the
HWH and the percentage reductions were within the
range found in other studies (PEACHEM, 1984).
However, although our data suggest that the
