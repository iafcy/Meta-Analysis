Transmission of enteric pathogens is facilitated in child day care centers, including
family day care homes, by frequent and intimate exposure among susceptible hosts,
with diaper changing as the highest-risk procedure for such transmission. The
objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention program
in decreasing the incidence of infectious disease symptoms in children attending
family day care homes during a 12-month period. Each of 24 family day care homes
was randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention
included four components: (1) a handwashing educational program and (2) use of
vinyl gloves, (3) use of disposable diaper changing pads, and (4) use of an
alcohol-based hand rinse by the day care provider. Symptoms of enteric disease
(diarrhea and vomiting) were significantly reduced in intervention family day care
homes (p s 0.05), whereas respiratory symptoms were not significantly different
between intervention and control family day care homes (p = 0.35). Diarrhea was
reported in 1 of every 100 child care days, representing one diarrhea episode per
month in a typical family day care home. (AM J INFECT CONTROL 1990; 18:347-53).
