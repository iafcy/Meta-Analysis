Measuring the effect of a hygiene behaviour intervention by indicators of
behaviour and diarrhoeal disease

Abstract
A social marketing approach used both qualitative and quantitative methods to develop a hygiene behav-
iour intervention in rural north-east Thailand. Behaviours were preselected from a previous study and the
intervention was designed to promote hand washing, especially before feeding a baby, cooking, eating, and
after defaecation or cleaning a baby’s bottom, and dish washing immediately after eating. A bacteriological
indicator (enumerating faecal streptococci using a finger impression technique) was developed to measure
changes in hand washing behaviour and observation (spot checks) of dirty dishes to indicate dish washing
practice. There was a significant improvement in both behaviours and a significant reduction in diarrhoeal
disease as a result of the intervention. Furthermore, both indicators were retrospectively found to be posi-
tively related to diarrhoeal disease incidence. However, receiving and being able to recall the intervention
messages was not necessarily sufficient to ensure behaviour change, as some adults found it difficult to
change old habits. Villages showing the greatest improvement tended to have a stronger sense of commu-
nity than others and to have more people actively involved in the intervention.

(BOOT & CAIRNCROSS, 1993). Qualitative information
obtained by open interviews and observations is crucial
to this process (PATTON, 1990), but behaviour is notori-
ously difficult to measure quantitatively. Although ques-
tionnaire type interviews may be useful for obtaining in-
formation about knowledge, evidence suggests that they
lead to over-reporting of ‘good’ behaviours (STANTON et
al., 1987; CURTIS et al., 1993). Structured observations
made by continuous monitoring have been successfully
applied to interventions involving behaviour modifica-
tion (STANTON & CLEMENS,I~~~;BENTLEY etal., 1990).
However! this method is time consuming, difficult to
standardize and requires a great deal of skill in design to
avoid reactivity. Consequently, there is a need to develop
simple indicators of behaviour.
Materials and Methods
Site and study outline
The study was conducted in Khon Kaen province in
north-eastern Thailand, the largest and poorest region of
the country. Most of the population live in rural villages
which are fairly cohesive clusters of 60 to about 200
homes. Poor soils and unreliable patterns of rainfall have
led to a low-risk approach to farming and a large
number of people rely on seasonal migrant work to sup-
plement their income. Typically, villagers rely on a vari-
ety of water sources for their domestic needs. Water
