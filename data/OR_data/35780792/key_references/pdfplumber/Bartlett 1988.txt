From October 1981 to September 1984, the authors conducted a three-year
longitudinal study of diarrhea among infants and toddlers attending day care
centers In Maricopa County, Arizona. In the third year of study, they evaluated
the effects on diarrhea rates of staff training without external monitoring and of
active surveillance conducted throughout the study. From 21 study day care
centers, they randomly selected 10 ("intervention day care centers") to receive
staff training in procedures to reduce transmission of Infectious diarrhea. Contin-
uing active surveillance in the 10 intervention and 11 control day care centers
found no difference between diarrhea rates in intervention day care centers in
the pre- and posttraining years and no difference between diarrhea rates in the
two groups of centers either before or after the training intervention. Biweekly
family-based surveys during the two months after training also demonstrated no
difference between infant-toddler diarrhea rates in intervention and control day
care centers. These surveys found the 21 study day care centers to have
significantly higher diarrhea rates than did day care homes or households not
using day care, but significantly lower rates than day care centers not included
In the active surveillance. Continuous surveillance without training was associ-
ated with a significant decrease in diarrheal illness during the course of longitu-
dinal study. One-time staff training without subsequent monitoring did not result
in additional decreases and did not lower day care center diarrhea rates to the
levels observed in day care homes and households not using day care.
