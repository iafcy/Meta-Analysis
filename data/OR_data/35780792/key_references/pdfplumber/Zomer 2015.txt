SUMMARY
Infections are common in children attending daycare centres (DCCs). We evaluated the effect
of a hand hygiene (HH) intervention for caregivers on the incidence of gastrointestinal and
respiratory infections in children. The intervention was evaluated in a two-arm cluster
randomized controlled trial. Thirty-six DCCs received the intervention including HH products,
training sessions, and posters/stickers. Thirty-five control DCCs continued usual practice.
Incidence of episodes of diarrhoea and the common cold in children was monitored by parents
during 6 months. Using multilevel Poisson regression, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained. Diarrhoeal incidence was monitored in 545 children for
91937 days. During follow-up, the incidence was 3·0 episodes per child-year in intervention
DCCs vs. 3·4 in control DCCs (IRR 0·90, 95% CI 0·73–1·11). Incidence of the common cold was
monitored in 541 children for 91373 days. During follow-up, the incidence was 8·2 episodes per
child-year in intervention DCCs vs. 7·4 in control DCCs (IRR 1·07, 95% CI 0·97–1·19). In this
study, no evidence for an effect of the intervention was demonstrated on the incidence of
episodes of diarrhoea and the common cold.
