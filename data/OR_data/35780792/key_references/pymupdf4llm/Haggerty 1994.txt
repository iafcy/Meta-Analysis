reduce diarrhoeal disease in rural Zaire: Impact of the intervention on diarrtioeal morbidity. International Journal of
_Epidemiology 1994; 23: 1050-1059._
_Background. Diarrhoeal disease is a leading cause of morbidity in young children in rural Zaire. Few diarrhoea preven-_
tion programmes have been implemented in Bandundu Province, where available data suggest an annual prevalence
rate of 10%. The urgent need to reduce diarrhoeal morbidity in Zaire, together with the potential effectiveness and
feasibility of hygiene education as a diarrhoea prevention strategy, led to the development of the present research
project.
_Methods. A randomized, controlled trial of an education intervention to reduce diarrhoea through improved personal_
and domestic hygiene behaviours was conducted in 18 geographically separate village clusters (sites) in rural Zaire. For
12 weeks baseline information on the diarrhoeal morbidity of 2082 children aged 3-35 months was collected at weekly
home visits, and structured observations of hygiene practices related to diarrhoea were made on a subset of 300
families. Intervention messages addressed disposal of animal faeces from the yard, handwashing after defecation and
before meal preparation and eating, and disposal of children's faeces. Three months after the start of the intervention
and exactly 1 year after the baseline studies, a second diarrhoeal morbidity study and a second observational study
were conducted in order to evaluate the intervention.
_Results. Children in intervention communities experienced an 11% reduction in the risk of reporting diarrhoea during_
the peak diarrhoeal seaon, compared to controls (P < 0.025). The largest differences were seen among children aged
24-35 months, with those from intervention communities reporting significantly fewer episodes, shorter mean dura-
tions and hence fewer days of diarrhoea. There was some evidence that greater reductions in diarrhoea occurred in
sites where the quality of the intervention, a scored measure of volunteer efficacy and community participation, was
highest.
_Conclusions. The results of this study suggest that hygiene education may be an effective approach to reduce the in-_
cidence and duration of diarrhoeal episodes in rural Zaire. Children aged 2 years appear to benefit the most. A
Hawthorne effect of the education may contribute to diarrhoeal reductions.
