Summary objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of point of use water treatment with flocculent-disinfectant on
reducing diarrhoea and the additional benefit of promoting hand washing with soap.
methods The study was conducted in squatter settlements of Karachi, Pakistan, where diarrhoea is a
leading cause of childhood death. Interventions were randomly assigned to 47 neighbourhoods.
Households in 10 neighbourhoods received diluted bleach and a water vessel; nine neighbourhoods
received soap and were encouraged to wash hands; nine neighbourhoods received flocculent-disinfectant
water treatment and a water vessel; 10 neighbourhoods received disinfectant-disinfectant water treatment and soap and were encouraged to wash hands; and nine neighbourhoods were followed as controls. Field workers visited households at least once a week from April to December 2003 to promote use
of the interventions and to collect data on diarrhoea.
results Study participants in control neighbourhoods had diarrhoea on 5.2% of days. Compared
to controls, participants living in intervention neighbourhoods had a lower prevalence of diarrhoea:
55% (95% CI 17%, 80%) lower in bleach and water vessel neighbourhoods, 51% (95% CI 12%, 76%)
lower in hand washing promotion with soap neighbourhoods, 64% lower (95% CI 29%, 90%)
in disinfectant-disinfectant neighbourhoods, and 55% (95% CI 18%, 80%) lower in disinfectantdisinfectant plus hand washing with soap neighbourhoods.
conclusions With an intense community-based intervention and supplies provided free of cost, each
of the home-based interventions significantly reduced diarrhoea. There was no benefit by combining
hand washing promotion with water treatment.

Introduction

Diarrhoea is a leading cause of childhood death globally
(WHO 1999). When introduced separately, both point-ofuse drinking water treatment and hand washing with soap
decrease the frequency of childhood diarrhoea (Mintz et al.
2001; Curtis & Cairncross 2003). Recent meta-analyses
estimate a mean 47% reduction in diarrhoea with hand
washing with soap and a mean 35% reduction with point
of use water treatment (Curtis & Cairncross 2003; Fewtrell
et al. 2005). If either of these interventions was actively
promoted by a public health organisation, the marginal
cost of promoting the second one would be reduced.
However, we are unaware of any studies evaluating the


combined effectiveness of hand washing promotion with
point-of-use water treatment.
In Pakistan, diarrhoea is a leading cause of death,
especially in the squatter settlements of its large cities
(Marsh et al. 1995; Khan et al. 1993). Previous intervention studies in squatter settlements in Pakistan have
demonstrated that both point-of-use drinking water treatment with sodium hypochlorite and hand washing with
soap reduced diarrhoea (Luby et al. 2004a, b). We
introduced a new flocculent-disinfectant for home water
treatment as part of a neighbourhood-based intervention.
We evaluated its effect in reducing diarrhoea and the
added effect of including hand washing promotion with
soap.

Methods

Setting

This study was conducted in adjoining multi-ethnic
squatter settlements in central Karachi—Bhittaiabad, Bilal
Colony, Mujahid Colony, Manzoor Colony and Zia
Colony. The field work was done by Health Oriented
Preventive Education (HOPE), a local non-governmental
organisation that operates health clinics and undertakes
community-based health and development initiatives in the
area.

Design

The study was a cluster randomised controlled trial.
Randomisation and intervention assignment was made at
the neighbourhood level, because important components of
the efforts to encourage adoption and regular use of the
intervention occurred at this level. These included formal
meetings and presentations by study personnel to community leaders and community members, lane meetings
with community residents, as well as the normal discussions that neighbours had with each other about the
interventions when no study personnel were present.

Study groups

Field workers identified communities that typically
received at least one hour of running water twice weekly,
and had not received soap or water treatment in a previous
study with HOPE. Within these communities the study
team identified barriers, for example a commercial street or
industrial zone that separated groups of households into 49
identifiable clusters of between 54 and 245 households.
Within the clusters field workers approached each household. If the female or male head of household confirmed
that they had at least one child under the age of 5 years
living in the household and if they provided informed
consent, the field workers administered a baseline questionnaire. Ultimately, they identified 49 clusters with
between 16 and 37 eligible, consented households per
cluster.
The 49 clusters were listed in the order that they had
been identified. Using a spreadsheet, the five study groups
(bleach water treatment, hand washing promotion with
soap, flocculent-disinfectant water treatment, flocculentdisinfectant plus hand washing promotion with soap and
control) were assigned a computer generated random
number. The five study groups were ordered according to
their random number, and this order was consecutively and
repetitively applied to the list of the 49 clusters. Each study
group continued to have clusters assigned until just over


260 households were assigned to the group. Any additional
clusters that would have been assigned to that group by
consecutive assignment, but would have been more than
necessary to encompass 260 households, were left unassigned. Ultimately 47 clusters and 1340 households were
assigned to the five study groups (Figure 1).

Field workers

Field workers, recruited from the study or nearby communities, were extensively trained in interviewing techniques, in data recording, in general approaches to
community motivation and in specific techniques for
promoting hand washing and drinking water treatment.
The same field workers promoted regular use of the
interventions and collected outcome data during their
household visits.

Interventions

Field workers arranged neighbourhood meetings. They
used slide shows, videotapes and pamphlets to illustrate
health problems resulting from hand and water contamination and to provide specific instructions on how to use
the intervention assigned to that neighbourhood. Field
workers, who spoke the first language of the study subjects,
visited each participating household at least twice weekly.
They encouraged use of the interventions, answered
questions, and provided families with the consumable
supplies necessary for ongoing use of the intervention.
Each participating household received a 20-litre insulated plastic water vessel with a wide mouth (15 cm), lid
and tap. Field workers diluted three parts of locally
manufactured bleach (4.4 mg% sodium hypochlorite)
with 17 parts distilled water, and packaged the dilute
hypochlorite into 10-ml reusable plastic bottles. One
plastic bottle of dilute bleach added to 20 l of locally
available water, typically produced a free chlorine residual
between 0.5 and 2.0 mg/l. Households were instructed to
empty one bottle of the dilute hypochlorite into the filled
20 l water vessel and to wait 30 min before drinking.
Field workers encouraged families to drink only treated
water, but neither encouraged nor discouraged hand
washing.
The intervention soap was 90 g white bars of Safeguard�* bar soap (Procter and Gamble, Cincinnati, USA).
The soap was generically packaged without a brand name
or symbol. Field workers encouraged participants to wet

their hands, lather them completely with soap, and rub
them together for 45 s. Hands were typically dried on the
participants’ clothing. Field workers encouraged all persons in intervention households old enough to understand
(generally those over 30 months of age) to wash their
hands after defecation, after cleaning an infant who had
defecated, before preparing food, before eating and before
feeding infants. Field workers encouraged adopting regular
hand washing habits, but for this group neither encouraged
nor discouraged drinking water treatment.
Field workers instructed study subjects to add a single
sachet of the flocculent-disinfectant to 10 l of water in a
bucket, to stir it vigorously for 5 min, and then let it stand
until the floc settled to the bottom. Then study subjects
were instructed to decant the flocculent-disinfectant treated
water through a piece of flannel cloth into their water
storage vessel, and discard the remaining residue in the
toilet. They washed the filter cloth with detergent, and
hung it to dry before re-use. The treated water was ready to
drink 30 min after the flocculent-disinfectant was introduced. Field workers encouraged families to drink only
treated water, but for this group they neither encouraged


nor discouraged hand washing. Field workers provided the
supplies and instructions for both hand washing promotion
and water treatment with flocculent-disinfectant.
Field workers provided control households with a
regular supply of children’s books, notebooks, pens and
pencils to help with their children’s education, but no
products that would be expected to affect diarrhoea. Field
workers neither encouraged nor discouraged hand washing
or drinking water treatment in control households. Field
workers visited control households and intervention
households with equal frequency to collect health outcome
data, but the visits were shorter in control households
because no health education or encouragement for behaviour change was provided.

Measurements

Field workers conducted a pre-intervention baseline survey
of household characteristics. They identified the mother or
caregiver and each child in the household. Children’s dates
of birth were confirmed with birth certificates, immunization records, or event calendars. Field workers visited

participating households at least weekly, for 37 weeks
(April 2003–December 2003), and asked the mother or
other caregiver if the children had diarrhoea (three or more
loose stools within 24 h) in the preceding week, and, if so,
for how many days. The mother was also asked about her
own symptoms of diarrhoea. Typically, field workers
visited each household twice during the week to ensure that
episodes of diarrhoea from both early and late in the week
were recalled. Supervisors revisited 40% of homes each
week and reviewed the history of diarrhoea among family
members. The history recorded by the supervisor was
compared to the history recorded by the field worker, and
if there was a discrepancy, the fieldworker and supervisor
revisited the house to clarify the difference.

Statistics

The primary hypotheses of the study included that each of
the interventions would reduce diarrhoea compared to the
control group and that the combination of water treatment
with flocculent-disinfectant and hand washing promotion
with soap would result in less diarrhoea than either
intervention separately. The primary study outcome was
the percent of person-weeks that study subjects had at least
one day of diarrhoea. For a more precise analysis we also
calculated the percent of person-days with diarrhoea that is
we summed the number of days each study subject had
diarrhoea and divided it by the total number of days of
observation. We measured diarrhoea using longitudinal
prevalence, rather than incidence, because longitudinal
prevalence is more closely associated with growth faltering
and child mortality than is diarrhoea incidence (Morris
et al. 1996).
We calculated a sample size of 256 households per
intervention group assuming diarrhoea would occur in 3%
of person weeks in the control group, a 35% lower
prevalence (1.95%) with the single intervention of either
hand washing promotion or water treatment, an additional
30% lower prevalence (1.365%) with combined hand
washing promotion and water treatment, 3.8 children per
household, 10% dropout, 95% follow-up, 80% power,
95% confidence, one-sided testing, and a quadrupling of
sample size to offset the effect of clustering by neighbourhood and repeated measures.
Because we assigned study groups at the neighbourhood
level, we analysed the comparison of outcomes at the
neighbourhood level. Specifically, within each neighbourhood, among person-weeks within the subgroup of interest, we identified the total number of person-weeks (or
days) with diarrhoea and divided it by the total number of
person-weeks (or days) at risk for persons in that neighbourhood within the subgroup of interest. For evaluation


of severe diarrhoea we identified children under age 5 years
at the end of the study who were observed for at least
11 weeks and calculated the proportion who had diarrhoea
during >10% of observed days. We calculated prevalence
by intervention assignment by taking the mean of the
appropriate neighbourhood prevalences weighted by the
number of observations. We calculated prevalence ratios
by dividing the weighted means from intervention neighbourhoods by the weighted means from control neighbourhoods (Donner & Klar 2000). We calculated standard
confidence intervals for a ratio of normal means (Cox &
Hinkley 1974). This approach calculated confidence
intervals that reflected the different distribution of proportions at the neighbourhood level. We report the percent
difference in outcome between intervention and control,
that is, the prevalence ratio minus one. Similarly, we report
the 95% confidence around this percent difference by
subtracting 1 from the upper and lower confidence limit of
the prevalence ratio.
The disease experience of each child, household, and
neighbourhood was tracked and analysed with the group
they were originally assigned to, that is the analysis was
intention to treat. To calculate the intracluster correlation
coefficient we first constructed an analysis of variance
model. We used the longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea
among each participant throughout the study as the
dependent variable, and intervention group and neighbourhood as independent variables. We then compared the
variance between neighbourhoods to the variance within
neighbourhoods to calculate the intracluster correlation
coefficient and the design effect (Donner & Klar 2000).

Ethics

Community leaders and heads of households provided
informed consent. Ill children were assessed by field
workers and referred to the appropriate level of health
care. The first line of treatment for diarrhoea was oral
rehydration solution. Ill children referred by field workers
were offered clinical services free of charge at HOPE health
care facilities located in these communities. This included
hospital admission and associated costs in case of
emergencies. The study protocol was approved by the
Ethics Review Committee of the Aga Khan University, the
HOPE Human Research Review Board and an Institutional
Review Board of the Centres for Disease Control and
Prevention.

Results

Among 6962 households in the study neighbourhoods,
1337 households (19%) met the inclusion criteria and

enrolled in the study. The number of clusters, households,
persons and births was similar across the intervention
groups (Figure 1). Overall, data were collected from 92%
of the potential person-weeks of follow-up, though it
differed across groups, ranging from 87% among persons
living in households that received flocculent-disinfectant to
96% in control households.
At baseline, the households in the different study groups
were similar in size, socio-economic status, drinking water
source, hand washing and sanitary facilities, and purchases
of soap and water (Table 1). During the course of the
study, children were routinely breastfed in all of the
groups, although there was some difference by intervention
group in exclusive breast-feeding among children under age
6 months.
Persons living in neighbourhoods that received any of the
interventions had markedly less diarrhoea compared to
persons living in control neighbourhoods (Table 2). The
reduction in daily longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea
ranged from 51% among households receiving soap and
hand washing promotion to 64% among households
receiving flocculent-disinfectant. There was no apparent
additional benefit to flocculent-disinfectant water treatment plus hand washing promotion with soap, compared
to either of these interventions individually.
The longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea varied markedly over the course of the study. In July 2003, 190 mm of
rain fell in Karachi, 2.6 times the 50-year mean July rainfall
of 72 mm (U.S. Department of Commerce 2003). In the first
3 months of observation, persons living in neighbourhoods
that received flocculent-disinfectant had a lower prevalence
of diarrhoea compared to households that received soap
and hand washing promotion or soap and hand washing
promotion plus flocculent-disinfectant (Figure 2). During
the heavy rains in July, the prevalence of diarrhoea in
intervention neighbourhoods was the same as in control
neighbourhoods. Diarrhoea prevalence peaked in the control group following the heavy July rains. During the last
5 months of observation the diarrhoea prevalence across
the intervention groups tracked fairly closely together, and
was markedly lower than control neighbourhoods.
Younger children had a higher longitudinal prevalence of
diarrhoea, with infants having the highest prevalence
(Table 3). The largest reductions in diarrhoea prevalence
with interventions occurred among children 5–15 years.
Diarrhoea prevalence was consistently lower among
infants and children ‡1–2 years who lived in intervention
neighbourhoods compared to control neighbourhoods,
however the magnitude of the reductions were less than the
overall reduction, and many of the individual age and
intervention specific reductions were not statistically significant (Table 3).


Persons living in intervention neighbourhoods were
significantly less likely to visit a practitioner for diarrhoea
treatment (Table 4). Hospitalisation for diarrhoea was a
rare outcome that did not occur at significantly different
rates in intervention versus control neighbourhoods
(Table 4). Intervention neighbourhoods had a substantially
lower proportion of children under age 5 years with >10%
of observed days with diarrhoea than persons in control
neighbourhoods, though the 95% confidence limit in the
bleach water treatment group did not quite exclude zero
(Table 4).
The percentage of study participants followed up each
week declined during the course of the study (Figure 3).
This decline was most marked among persons living in
neighbourhoods assigned to flocculent-disinfectant and
least common among households in the control and hand
washing promotion neighbourhoods. Excluding children
born during the study, 82% of study subjects completed
34 (92%) or more weeks of follow-up. During the weeks
they were observed, study subjects with fewer than
34 weeks of follow-up reported a similar mean longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea compared to the mean
longitudinal prevalence of study subjects in their same
study group who completed 34 or more weeks of followup (Table 5).
There was some reported difference in exclusive breastfeeding across intervention groups, especially among children under the age of 6 months (Table 1). However,
children under the age of 6 months represent less than 1%
of the total person-weeks observed, and the effects of the
interventions were clearly independent of exclusive breastfeeding for the majority of the population who was beyond
the age of breastfeeding (Table 3).
Households in the flocculent-disinfectant water treatment group averaged using 21.6 sachets per week or 4.4 l
of treated water per person per day. Households in the
flocculent-disinfectant plus hand-washing group averaged
20.4 sachets or 4.3 l of treated water per person per day.
The consumption of sachets during July when there were
heavy rains (21.5 sachets per household per week) was
consistent with consumption throughout the summer.
Households receiving bleach consumed sufficient bleach to
treat an average of 3.0 l of treated water per person per
day. Soap households averaged consuming 2.5 bars of soap
per week, for a mean 3.5 g of soap per person per day.
Households often added ice purchased in the market to
their drinking water. Between July and October households
receiving the bleach water treatment added ice 5.3 times
per week, households receiving the flocculent disinfected
added ice an average of 5.2 times per week and households
receiving the flocculent disinfected plus soap added ice an
average of 4.9 times per week.

Discussion

Point-of-use water treatment with either bleach or flocculent-disinfectant as well as hand washing promotion with
soap resulted in marked reductions in the overall prevalence of diarrhoea. The magnitude of the reduction in
diarrhoea seen with hand washing promotion with soap
and with dilute sodium hypochlorite was consistent with
previous evaluations (Mintz et al. 2001; Curtis & Cairncross 2003; Luby et al. 2004a,b; Fewtrell et al. 2005). The
64% reduction in diarrhoea seen with flocculent-disinfectant was larger than the reductions noted in three
previous trials in rural non-refugee settings including a
24%–29% reduction in an initial study in rural Guatemala
(Reller et al. 2003), a 40% reduction in a follow-up study
in rural Guatemala (Chiller et al. 2006) and a 16%


reduction in rural Western Kenya (Crump et al. 2005). The
most salient difference among these studies was that in
Karachi, product consumption was substantially higher
with a mean of over 20 sachets used per household per
week compared to six in the first Guatemala study, 10 in
the second Guatemala study and 10 in the Kenya study
(Reller et al. 2003; Crump et al. in press; Chiller et al. in
press).
The combination of household water treatment plus
hand washing promotion with soap failed to reduce
diarrhoea more than either intervention separately.
Although this is the first simultaneous comparison of
combined hand washing and water treatment compared
against either intervention alone that we are aware of, in
Fewtrell’s meta analysis (2005) interventions that combined water, hygiene and sanitation interventions were no
more effective in reducing diarrhoea than programs interventions that focused on a single intervention. One possible
explanation is that 65%–75% of diarrhoea among persons
living in this sewage contaminated environment is caused
by pathogens that require a large dose to cause disease. A
substantial reduction in the number of organisms ingested,
either through hand washing or water treatment, may
markedly reduce diarrhoea, but once ingested dose is
below a certain threshold, further modest reduction in the
dose of ingested organisms may not markedly reduce
disease risk. Other possible explanations include that a
substantial part of the reported reduction in diarrhoeal
disease was a result of courtesy bias. Intervention households were given supplies free of cost, and may have
wanted to meet the expectation of the study workers.
Courtesy bias would not be expected to be additive with
more interventions. A third possible explanation is that
improving one hygiene behaviour in the home may lead to
improvement in other hygiene related behaviours. Study

Prior studies in squatter settlements in Karachi have
noted a delay between distribution of household interventions and effect on diarrhoea outcome (Luby et al.
2004a,b). We hypothesize that with time there is technical
mastery and increasingly habitual use of household interventions to prevent diarrhoea. During the present study
after 6 weeks of intervention, the disease experience of the
intervention neighbourhoods had diverged from the control neighbourhoods. However, none of the interventions
appeared to be effective in preventing diarrhoea during the
heavy rain and acute flooding in July. There was no fall off
in product consumption during these weeks. This suggests
that during the heavy rains and flooding there was so much
fecal contamination of the environment that neither water
treatment nor hand washing with soap reduced the
ingested dose of pathogens sufficiently to prevent diarrhoea. After the flooding abated, the difference between
intervention and control neighbourhoods re-emerged and
was stable into the lower prevalence winter season as has
been noted in a prior hand washing intervention study
(Luby et al. 2004b).
Although intervention supplies were provided at no cost,
fewer households were available for follow-up for each of
the intervention groups compared to control. The largest
drop off in use was among households using the most timeintensive intervention, the flocculent-disinfectant. For any
of these household-based interventions to have a substantial public health impact they need to be valued enough so
that a large proportion of the at-risk population chooses to
become regular users.
There are important limitations to the study. First, study
personnel and participants were not blinded to the intervention. It is possible that study participants in the
intervention groups, grateful for the supplies, minimized
reported episodes of diarrhoea in the household, or field
workers recorded fewer episodes because of a desire to
meet the expectation of study sponsors. However, field
workers were formally trained, and the importance of
accurate recording of reported symptoms was stressed.
Unannounced supervisory visits did not identify systematic
errors.
A second limitation is that the differential follow-up
among groups suggests that persons who used the interventions more conscientiously may have been over-sampled compared to less regular users. However, the
prevalence of diarrhoea did not differ among persons who
were followed for fewer weeks, so their loss to follow-up is
unlikely to have had a marked effect on the results.
In this setting where diarrhoea is a leading cause of death
and the environment is heavily contaminated with sewage,
household-level interventions to improve drinking water
quality and hand washing promotion with soap resulted in

workers provided supplies and messages only for the
assigned intervention, but in descriptive studies hygiene
behaviours are typically closely associated (Bartlett et al.
1992). Self-efficacy in one area could lead to self-efficacy in
another. Fourth, it is possible that the combination of
water treatment and hand washing promotion would have
an additive effect, but introducing two interventions
simultaneously did not allow their optimal combined use.
Behaviour change is best achieved with single simple
messages (Loevinsohn 1990), an approach that combining
two interventions in one season did not permit. However,
product consumption was similar in the combined and
separate intervention arms.

a marked reduction in diarrhoea. Outside of a randomised

supplies at no cost and regularly encouraged to use them,
water treatment and hand washing would probably be less
consistent. Some families and individuals may be more
inclined to adopt one or the other intervention. Thus, as
part of a public health program, promoting both hand
washing and point-of-use water treatment with safe storage
may expand the proportion of the population that adopts a
protective behaviour and thereby produce additive benefit.
However, these data suggest that an additive benefit of
hand washing and water treatment should not be assumed,
that the cost of multiple messages both for public health
programs to deliver and for low income families to adopt
may not be justified. The next step in determining the role
that these approaches have in preventing diarrhoea globally is to implement them at larger scale and evaluate their
practicality, uptake and effectiveness.

Combinaison du traitement de l’eau de boisson et du lavage des mains pour la pre´vention de la diarrhe´e: une e´tude randomise´e controˆle´e en grappe

objectifs Evaluer l’efficacite´ du traitement de l’eau au point d’utilisation avec un de´sinfectant floculant sur la re´duction des diarrhe´es et le be´ne´fice
additionnel de la promotion du lavage des mains.
me´thodes l’e´tude a e´te´ conduite dans les installations d’habitations de fortune de Karachi au Pakistan ou` la diarrhe´e est la cause principale de
mortalite´ infantile. Les interventions ont e´te´ assigne´es de fac¸on randomise´e a` 47 quartiers. Dans 10 quartiers, les familles ont rec¸u de l’eau de javel dilue´e
et des contenaires pour l’eau. Dans 9 quartiers, elles ont rec¸u du savon et ont e´te´ motive´es pour le lavage des mains. Dans 9 quartiers, elles ont rec¸u le
de´sinfectant floculant pour le traitement de l’eau et des contenaires pour l’eau. Dans 10 quartiers, elles ont rec¸u le de´sinfectant floculant et du savon et
ont e´te´ motive´es pour le lavage des mains. 9 quartiers ont e´te´ suivis comme controˆles. Les agents de terrain ont visite´ chaque famille au moins une fois
par semaine, d’avril a` de´cembre 2003 pour promouvoir l’utilisation des interventions et pour collecter des donne´es sur la diarrhe´e.
re´sultats Les participants dans les quartiers controˆles avaient la diarrhe´e sur 5,2% des jours. Compare´s au controˆles, les participants des quartiers
recevant l’intervention avaient une pre´valence de diarrhe´e plus faible repartie comme suit: 55% (IC95%: 17–80) plus faible dans les quartiers ayant rec¸u
l’eau de javel et des centenaires, 51% (IC95%: 12–76) plus faible dans les quartiers ayant rec¸u la promotion du lavage des mains, 64% (IC95%: 29–90)
dans les quartiers ayant rec¸u le de´sinfectant floculant et 55% (IC95%: 18–80) plus faible dans les quartiers ayant rec¸u le de´sinfectant floculant en plus de
savon pour le lavage des mains.
conclusion Avec une forte intervention base´e sur la communaute´ et des moyens procure´s sans charge, chacune des interventions a entraıˆne´ une
re´duction significative de la diarrhe´e. Il n’y avait pas de be´ne´fice supple´ment en combinant la promotion du lavage des mains et le traitement de l’eau.

Combinando el tratamiento del agua potable y el lavado de manos para la prevencio´n de la diarrea, un ensayo aleatorizado, controlado por clusters.

objetivos Evaluar la efectividad del tratar el agua con desinfectante floculado en la reduccio´n de la diarrea, ası´ como los beneficios adicionales en la
promocio´n del lavado de manos con jabo´n.
me´todos El estudio fue conducido en asentamientos ilegales de Karachi, Pakista´n, en los que la diarrea es la principal causa de mortalidad infantil. Las
intervenciones fueron asignadas aleatoriamente en 47 barrios. Las casas de 10 barrios recibieron lejı´a diluida y un recipiente para agua; en 9 barrios se
entrego´ jabo´n y se les animo´ a que se lavasen las manos; en otros 9 barrios se entrego´ desinfectante floculado para tratamiento del agua y un recipiente
para agua; 10 barrios recibieron desinfectante floculado para tratamiento del agua y jabo´n, y se les animo´ a que se lavaran las manos; y 9 barrios fueron
seguidos como controles. Los trabajadores de campo visitaron las casas al menos una vez por semana, entre Abril y Diciembre del 2003, para promover
el uso de la intervencio´n y para recolectar datos sobre diarreas.
resultados Los participantes de los barrios controles tuvieron diarrea en un 5.2% de los dı´as. Comparado con los controles, los participantes que
vivı´an en uno de los barrios en los que se intervino tuvieron una menor prevalencia de diarrea: 55% (95% IC 17%, 80%) menos en los barrios en los que
se entrego´ lejı´a y un recipiente para el agua, 51% (95% IC 12%, 76%) menos en los barrios en los que se promovio´ el lavado de manos con jabo´n, 64%
menos (95% IC 29%, 90%) en los barrios con desinfectante floculado, y 55% (95% IC 18%, 80%) menos en los barrios con desinfectante floculado
ma´s promocio´n del lavado de manos con jabo´n.
conclusiones Con una intervencio´n comunitaria intensiva y suministros gratuitos, cada una de las Intervenciones redujo la diarrea de forma
significativa. No se hallo´ beneficio en combinar la promocio´n del lavado de manos con el tratamiento del agua.
