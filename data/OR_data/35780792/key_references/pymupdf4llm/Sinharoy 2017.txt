### Summary
**Background Community health clubs are multi-session village-level gatherings led by trained facilitators and designed**
**to promote healthy behaviours mainly related to water, sanitation, and hygiene. They have been implemented in**
**several African and Asian countries but have never been evaluated rigorously. We aimed to evaluate the effect of**
**two versions of the community health club model on child health and nutrition outcomes.**

**Methods** **We did a cluster-randomised trial in Rusizi district, western Rwanda. We defined villages as clusters.**
**We assessed villages for eligibility then randomly selected 150 for the study using a simple random sampling routine**
**in Stata. We stratified villages by wealth index and by the proportion of children younger than 2 years with caregiver-**
**reported diarrhoea within the past 7 days. We randomly allocated these villages to three study groups: no intervention**
**(control; n=50), eight community health club sessions (Lite intervention; n=50), or 20 community health club sessions**
**(Classic intervention; n=50). Households in these villages were enrolled in 2013 for a baseline survey, then re-enrolled**
**in 2015 for an endline survey. The primary outcome was caregiver-reported diarrhoea within the previous 7 days in**
**children younger than 5 years. Analysis was by intention to treat and per protocol. This trial is registered with**
**ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01836731.**

**Findings At the baseline survey undertaken between May, 2013, and August, 2013, 8734 households with children**
**younger than 5 years of age were enrolled. At the endline survey undertaken between Sept 21, 2015, and**
**Dec 22, 2015, 7934 (91%) of the households were re-enrolled. Among children younger than 5 years, the prevalence**
**of caregiver-reported diarrhoea in the previous 7 days was 514 (14%) of 3616 assigned the control, 453 (14%)**
**of 3196 allocated the Lite intervention (prevalence ratio compared with control 0·97, 95% CI 0·81–1·16; p=0·74),**
**and 495 (14%) of 3464 assigned the Classic intervention (prevalence ratio compared with control 0·99, 0·85–1·15;**
**p=0·87).**

**Interpretation** **Community health clubs, in this setting in western Rwanda, had no effect on caregiver-reported**
**diarrhoea among children younger than 5 years. Our results question the value of implementing this intervention at**
**scale for the aim of achieving health gains.**

### Introduction
The importance of good health and nutrition for children
younger than 5 years is widely recognised. The recently
adopted Sustainable Development Goals include goals
such as zero hunger (Goal 2), good health and wellbeing
(Goal 3), and clean water and sanitation (Goal 6), which
reflect the global community’s prioritisation of the need
to improve food and nutrition security as well as coverage
of improved water and sanitation.[1]

The Government of Rwanda has made a commitment
to improving the health and nutrition of its children.[2,3]
The 2014–15 Demographic and Health Survey
documents a steady decline in the proportion of children
who are chronically undernourished (stunted), from
51% in 2005 to 38% in 2014–15.[4] However, in these data,
the prevalence of caregiver-reported diarrhoea has
declined only slightly, from 14% in 2005 to 12%
in 2014–15 possibly attributable in part to deficiencies


in water quality, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)
practices.[4]

As part of a strategy to address the continued high
prevalence of diarrhoea, the Rwandan Ministry of Health
launched the Community-Based Environmental Health
Promotion Programme (CBEHPP).[5] CBEHPP used the
community health club approach to promote healthy
practices, with the aim of achieving zero open defecation,
at least 80% hygienic latrine coverage, and improvements
in related health behaviours such as household water
treatment and handwashing with soap.[5] Similar groupbased approaches at the community level in sub-Saharan
Africa have been shown to have positive effects on infant
mortality and other health and nutrition outcomes, but
few studies have shown an effect on behaviours relating
to WASH.[6,7] The objective of our study was to evaluate the
effect of the CBEHPP model on child diarrhoea, child
anthropometry and household water quality


-----

**Research in context**

**Evidence before this study**
Before this study, systematic reviews had shown that
interventions designed to improve water quality, sanitation,
and hygiene (WASH) practices were generally effective at
preventing reported diarrhoea among young children in
low-income settings. There was less evidence that WASH
interventions could improve children’s nutritional status. In
general, reviews found the underlying evidence to be of low
quality. Moreover, randomised controlled trials of WASH
interventions delivered programmatically showed no
protective effect against diarrhoea, possibly because of poor
delivery and uptake of the intervention. Community health
clubs had been promoted in many countries in Africa and
southeast Asia as a means of improving WASH practices and
nutrition. However, they had never been evaluated rigorously
for their effect on health or other outcomes.

**Added value of this study**
The results of our cluster-randomised controlled trial show no
effect of a community health club intervention on


caregiver-reported diarrhoea among children younger than
5 years or on nutritional status among infants younger than
2 years. We noted positive effects of community health clubs on
some household-level intermediate outcomes within villages
allocated the full-length intervention (ie, 20 community health
club sessions), but these did not translate into improvements in
individual-level health and nutrition outcomes. Approaches
that use group education sessions for behaviour change with
the aim of improving maternal and child health and nutrition
are common in low-income and middle-income countries. Our
study suggests that these approaches might not be effective in
producing measurable improvements in health and nutrition.

**Implications of all the available evidence**
There is a need for more rigorous investigations to identify
low-cost interventions that are effective at improving child
health and nutrition, either independently or in combination.
These studies will need to assess programme delivery and
adherence to understand whether provision of interventions
can be improved to achieve greater effects.


### Methods
#### Study design
We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial to assess the
CBEHPP and community health club approach in a district
of Rwanda. To choose a location for the study, we worked
with the Rwandan Ministry of Health and the programme
implementer to select a district based on two criteria. First,
the district had to have no previous implementation of
CBEHPP and no existing donor commitment to support
implementation. Four of 30 districts nationwide met this
first criterion. Second, we sought a district with a high
burden of the diseases targeted by the planned intervention.
Using existing administrative data and focusing on diseases
such as malaria and helminth infection, the implementation
and research team examined the composition and severity
of the disease burden. The disease burden and absence of
donors across these four districts are strong predictors for a
high poverty concentration. We selected Rusizi district of
western Rwanda for this trial.

In Rwanda, districts are divided into sectors, followed
by cells, then villages. Cells contain two to eight villages.
Villages, as defined by the National Institute of Statistics
Rwanda (NISR), are the smallest geographical unit to
describe the allocation of the population. Village size is
heterogeneous: data from the national census of 2012
indicate that the mean village population is 600 (SD 300).
For our trial, we defined a cluster as a village. The
intervention entailed formation of community health
clubs at the village level.

The protocol for this study was reviewed and approved
by the Rwandan National Ethics Committee and the
Institutional Review Board of Innovations for Poverty
Action. We obtained written informed consent from the
main respondent before interview


#### Randomisation and masking
Of 598 villages in Rusizi district, we randomly selected
150 to take part in our trial (figure). We did the random
selection of villages in collaboration with NISR, which
shared a recently updated sampling frame of sectors, cells,
and villages for Rusizi district but did not share any
geographical identifiers. To minimise contamination, we
randomly selected five complete study samples of
150 villages each, then requested that NISR map the five
samples. Based on the resulting maps, we chose the one
sample that minimised the number of villages with shared
borders. For each of the five samples, the study team had
used a simple random sampling routine in Stata to select
at most two villages from large cells (≥3 villages) and one
village from small cells (<3 villages). We then randomly
sorted the cells and selected the villages numbered
from 1 to 150 to comprise the study sample.

We did a baseline survey of the 150 villages, which
included water sampling.[8] To increase the study’s power
to accurately detect improvements in child health, we
stratified the 150 villages along two dimensions: average
fraction of children younger than 2 years with caregiverreported diarrhoea in the previous 7 days; and average
wealth index, which is a standardised variable (mean 0·04

[SD 0·67]). The wealth index is a weighted average of a
household’s ownership of 17 assets in three categories:
durable goods such as refrigerator, television, and bicycle;
large livestock such as cattle, goats, or sheep; and
attributes of the housing structure, such as the roofing,
wall, and floor materials. Data for both diarrhoea and
wealth came from the baseline survey. Along both of
these dimensions, we divided the sample into three
equally sized groups representing high, moderate,
and low levels of diarrhoea and wealth We then

of at least 2 h between each visit.


cross-tabulated these in a 3 × 3 table that had a total of
nine cells. Within each cell, we used Stata to randomly
order the villages and divide them into three groups with
approximately the same number of villages in each
group. The first group of villages in each cell was
allocated to the control arm of the study, the second to a
“Lite” (shortened-duration) intervention arm, and the
third to a “Classic” (full-length) intervention arm. This
produced three study groups with 50 villages in each
group. In this way, we aimed to ensure study balance
along wealth, which, as a predictor of our main outcomes,
could otherwise undermine inference.[9,10]

One of us (JH) randomly allocated the 150 villages into
one of the three study groups. The evaluation team,
including data collectors, played no part in implemen­
tation of the intervention. The leadership of the
community health club in each village managed the
enrolment of participants into health clubs. To our
knowledge, enrolment and participation in community
health clubs was voluntary. Because of the nature of the
intervention, masking was not possible at the participant
or implementer level. It was also not possible to mask
treatment status during data collection because of the
nature of the survey questions, which pertained to
participation in the health clubs


#### Procedures
Full details of the intervention background and activities
are described elsewhere.[8] Briefly, community health
clubs in villages allocated to the Lite intervention held
eight sessions on village mapping, personal hygiene,
handwashing, diarrhoea, water sources, safe storage of
drinking water, treatment of drinking water, and
sanitation. The Classic intervention included 20 sessions,
consisting of all the Lite sessions plus common diseases,
skin diseases, infant care (weaning and immunisation),
worms and intestinal parasites, food hygiene, nutrition,
food safety and food security, the model home, good
parenting, respiratory disease, malaria, bilharzia
(schistosomiasis), and HIV/AIDS. In each village, the
facilitator determined the meeting times and frequency.
All sessions were open to any community members,
with no inclusion or exclusion criteria. Most sessions
had associated homework assignments to reinforce
participants’ learning. Implementation of the community
health club model was consistent with the approach
described elsewhere.[11]

For both interventions, community health club
sessions were typically led by the In-Charge of Social
Affairs (referred to in this report as the facilitator), who is
one of five members of the village-level Executive


-----

Committee. Facilitators in villages assigned to the Classic
intervention completed 5 days of training in
February, 2014, and facilitators in villages allocated the
Lite intervention had 2 days of training in June, 2014. The
facilitators were free to start organising community
health club sessions in their villages at any point after
completion of the training. The starting dates and
frequency of meetings varied widely across villages,
depending on the facilitator and on other events such as
village meetings, weddings, funerals, and rain.
Facilitators in villages assigned the Classic intervention


but not those allocated the Lite intervention, had a
training manual and visual aids. Community health
clubs in villages allocated the Classic intervention also
had attendance cards and organised graduation
ceremonies, at which participants received certificates.
We offered no other material incentives for participation.
Implementation of community health clubs was
complete in all intervention villages by March, 2015.

In the baseline survey, we targeted for inclusion all
households with a child younger than 5 years in the study
area, with no exclusion criteria. Data collection methods
for the baseline survey have been described elsewhere.[8]
Methods for the endline survey followed those of the
baseline, including a structured survey, observation, and
collection of drinking water samples from roughly 10% of
households. All follow-up, including water sampling,
took place during one visit. For the endline survey, data
collectors attempted to visit all households that had
enrolled in the baseline survey. If the data collector visited
a household three times in 1 day, with an interval of at
least 2 h between each visit, and was not able to enrol the
household, we recorded the household as a temporary
absence. In the endline survey, we gathered data for
caregiver-reported diarrhoea prevalence and anthro­po­
metric measurements for all children younger than
5 years. The baseline survey included length measure­
ments for children younger than 2 years and weight
measurements for children younger than 5 years;
therefore, some older children in the endline survey had
data from both baseline and endline surveys.

All data collectors were trained in pairs to obtain
anthropometric measurements according to a standard
procedure. The training included standardisation
sessions at local health centres.[12,13] We retrained any pairs
of data collectors whose interobserver reliability was
outside a predetermined range, and the pair attended
another standardisation session to confirm improvement.

We weighed all children younger than 5 years once, to
the nearest 20 g (for weight <20 kg) or 50 g (for weight
between 20 kg and 50 kg) using a Seca 385 scale (Seca,
Hamburg, Germany). We measured length (for children
<24 months) to the nearest 0·1 cm with Seca 417 length
boards and height (for children ≥24 months) to the
nearest 0·1 cm with Seca 213 stadiometers. We measured
length and height in duplicate; we calculated the average
of the two measurements for the analysis. If the two
measurements differed by more than 0·7 cm, we asked
data collectors to obtain a third length or height
measurement on the spot, and we averaged the two
closest measurements.

We obtained data for demographics (eg, child age and
sex) and validated children’s birth dates through
immunisation cards when possible. We calculated
stunting (defined as height-for-age or length-for-age
_Z score <–2) and wasting (defined as weight-for-height_
or weight-for-length _Z score <–2) for descriptive_
purposes


-----

We collected data for attendance at community health
club sessions through self-report, by which respondents
were asked to recall which sessions, if any, they or anyone
else in their household had attended. They were then
prompted by data collectors, who read aloud a list of
sessions and asked whether the respondent or anyone
else in the household had attended each session. We
combined the self-reported and prompted responses into
one continuous variable for number of sessions attended
by the household. The main treatment variable was the
intervention status of the village where the individual
lived at baseline.

#### Outcomes
The primary outcome was caregiver-reported diarrhoea
among children younger than 5 years in the past 7 days,
at endline (roughly 2 years after baseline). We used the
WHO definition of diarrhoea, which is three or more
loose stools (that can take the shape of a container)
within a 24-h period.[14] Secondary outcomes were heightfor-age or length-for-age Z score and weight-for-height or
weight-for-length Z score for children younger than
5 years who were measured at baseline. We calculated
these _Z scores using WHO growth standards.[15] An_
additional secondary outcome was colony-forming units
of thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms per 100 mL water,
which we calculated as described elsewhere.[8]

We also gathered data for intermediate outcomes,
including improved drinking water source; household
water treatment (boiling, filtration, chlorination, or solar
disinfection); presence of improved sanitation facility;
and sanitary disposal of children’s faeces. We measured
all these outcomes using a standard module from WHO
and UNICEF.[16] Data collectors also recorded the structure
of sanitation facility (presence of floors, walls, and a
roof); presence of faeces (human, animal, or both) in the
household courtyard; and presence of a handwashing
station with soap and water.

Other intermediate outcomes related to nutrition and
food security. These included exclusive breastfeeding for
infants younger than 6 months and dietary diversity for
children aged 6–23 months, measured using a standard
module from WHO.[17] We measured household food
security using the standard household hunger scale
module from Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance
(FANTA) III.[18] Nutrition and food security variables rely on
self-report by the main respondent or primary caregiver.

In addition to outcomes reported here, we gathered
data for secondary endpoints including clinical data for
diarrhoea and malaria and data for infant and child
mortality. Those outcomes will be reported elsewhere.

#### Statistical analysis
To calculate the sample size for our primary outcome
variable (caregiver-reported diarrhoea in children
aged <5 years in the past 7 days), we made several
assumptions—namely 85 children per village a


diarrhoea prevalence of 8% in villages allocated no
intervention (control), a 25% reduction in diarrhoea
attributable to the intervention, and an intravillage
correlation of 0·0067. These data were informed by
findings of previous diarrhoea studies and were updated
based on baseline data.[8,19] Using a standard formula for

the comparison of two proportions, and a design effect
calculated on the basis of the intravillage correlation and
village size, we estimated that 50 villages per arm would
yield 80% power to detect the 25% reduction in diarrhoea.

We calculated descriptive statistics for each study group
at baseline. Analysis of primary, secondary, and
intermediate outcomes was by intention to treat and per
protocol (for the Classic intervention only) at household
and individual levels. For dichotomous outcomes at the
individual level, we used log-binomial regression with a
log-link function and generalised estimating equations
(GEE) to account for village-level clustering, then
calculated the exponential of the coefficients to obtain
prevalence ratios (PRs). For dichotomous outcomes at
the household level, we used binomial regression with
an identity link function and GEE to obtain risk
differences (RDs). For the ordinal variable representing
household food security, we used ordinal logistic
regression then calculated the exponential of the
coefficients to obtain odds ratios (ORs). For continuous
variables, we used linear regression with GEE to account
for village-level clustering.

The primary analysis of anthropometric data included
children measured both at baseline and endline. These
children were all younger than 2 years at the time of the
baseline survey and, hence, were aged 2–4 years at the
time of the endline survey. Additional analyses included
all children with anthropometric data, including but not
restricted to those with baseline anthropometric data. For
the main analysis of the effect of the interventions on
height-for-age _Z score and weight-for-height_ _Z score_
among children who had been measured at baseline, we
included that child’s baseline length-for-age _Z score or_
weight-for-length _Z score, respectively. The adjustment_
for baseline values was done to improve precision of the
estimates. The anthropometric analysis including all
children was further stratified for children younger than
2 years and infants younger than 1 year, because the first
two years of life are judged an important window for


child growth.[20,21] No baseline adjustment was possible for
these calculations.

In all analyses, we estimated coefficients for villages
assigned the Classic and Lite interventions as differences
between these villages relative to those allocated the
control. We did not adjust for imbalance between study
groups at baseline, because the size of the differences
was small.

In the per-protocol analysis, we defined compliance
as self-reported attendance of any household members
at all 20 sessions. To investigate a potential doseresponse relation between session attendance and
effect size, we also calculated the effect size in those
attending between one and 20 sessions. Because the
per-protocol analysis showed no evidence for an effect,
we did not further subdivide by the number of sessions.
To reduce the risk of bias in the per-protocol analysis,
we adjusted for baseline values of each outcome
variable.

All analyses were done using Stata version 14.1. This
trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
NCT01836731.

#### Role of the funding source
The funder had no role in study design, data collection,
data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.
The corresponding author had full access to all the data
in the study and had final responsibility for the decision
to submit for publication.

### Results
Between May, 2013, and August, 2013, the baseline
survey of households was done, and between
Sept 21, 2015, and Dec 22, 2015, households were
re-enrolled for the endline survey. Of 8734 households
that consented to participate in the baseline survey,
7934 (91%) households gave written consent to participate
in the endline survey, with no difference in attrition
between intervention groups (figure). The most common
reasons for loss to follow-up were because the household
moved away or because of a temporary absence, defined
as being unavailable after data collectors visited the
household three times in 1 day, with an interval of at least
2 h between each visit. Of households that moved
between the baseline and endline surveys, most moved
outside the study area. Six households moved within the
study area and were enrolled in the endline survey. Only
one of these households moved to a village allocated a
different intervention; this household was included in
analyses based on its location at baseline. At baseline,
anthropometric measurements were obtained for
4598 children younger than 2 years; 3872 older children
in the endline survey had anthropometric data from both
baseline and endline surveys, whereas 5606 children had
only post-intervention anthropometric data.

Table 1 shows selected characteristics of children and
households in the study at baseline by study group Data

for 13 252 children younger than 5 years were obtained at
baseline. No differences were recorded between inter­
vention groups for the main outcomes of diarrhoea,
mean length-for age _Z score, mean weight-for-length_
_Z score, stunting, wasting, or mean thermotolerant_
coliforms per 100 mL water. The villages assigned the
control had a slightly lower prevalence of sanitation
facilities with complete floor, walls, and roof, and a lower
prevalence of no visible faeces in the courtyard. Villages
allocated the Lite intervention had a slightly lower
prevalence of improved sources of drinking water.
Exclusive breastfeeding, dietary diversity, and household
food security were not measured at baseline and are
therefore not included in table 1.

Table 2 shows characteristics of households and
children at endline. Data for 10 793 children younger
than 5 years were obtained at endline. Among children
younger than 5 years, the prevalence of caregiver-reported
diarrhoea in the previous 7 days was 514 (14%) of
3616 assigned the control, 453 (14%) of 3196 allocated the
Lite intervention, and 495 (14%) of 3464 assigned the
Classic intervention. Among children younger than
2 years, the mean length-for-age _Z score was –1·54_
(SD 1·25) for those allocated control, –1·59 (1·28) for
those assigned the Lite intervention, and –1·61 (1·32) for
those assigned the Classic intervention, and mean
weight-for-length _Z scores were, respectively, 0·18_
(SD 1·11), 0·18 (1·09), and 0·10 (1·11). The mean level of
thermotolerant coliforms per 100 mL water was 139·8
colony-forming units (SD 230·9) in villages assigned the
control, 164·1 (250·4) in villages allocated the Lite
intervention, and 156·2 (244·1) in villages assigned the
Classic intervention.

Table 3 shows the effect of the interventions on
primary, secondary, and intermediate outcomes at the
individual and household level (analysed by intention to
treat). Neither the Lite intervention nor the Classic
intervention had any effect on diarrhoea, height-for-age
or length-for-age _Z scores, or weight-for-height or_
weight-for-length _Z scores among children who had_
been measured at baseline or those younger than 5 years,
younger than 2 years, or younger than 1 year at endline.
The Lite and Classic interventions also had no effect on
water quality, as measured by thermotolerant coliforms
per 100 mL water.

Compared with control, the Classic intervention had a
positive effect on reported household water treatment
(RD 0·086, 95% CI 0·029–0·14; p=0·003), presence of
improved sanitation facilities (0·085, 0·015–0·16;
p=0·017), and presence of structurally complete
sanitation facility (0·065, 0·0013–0·13; p=0·046).
No effect of the Classic intervention was recorded on the
remaining intermediate outcomes, including improved
source of drinking water; sanitary disposal of children’s
faeces; presence of faeces in the courtyard; presence of a
handwashing station with soap; exclusive breastfeeding
for infants younger than 6 months; dietary diversity for


-----

infants aged 6–23 months; or household food security.
Further analysis of the relation between adequate water
treatment and the microbiological indicator of water
quality showed no association (β –19·3, 95% CI
–51·0 to 12·4; data not shown in table). In the Lite
intervention, no effect was recorded on any intermediate
outcomes versus control.

Among those assigned the Classic intervention,
respondents or other household members reported


attending a mean of 9·2 (SD 8·1) community health
club sessions. Table 4 shows descriptive statistics and
table 5 shows results of the per-protocol analysis of
effects on primary, secondary, and intermediate
outcomes for those allocated the Classic intervention
who reported attending at least one session or all
20 sessions, compared with those allocated control. For
those who reported attending at least one session,
findings of the per-protocol analysis suggested a negative
effect on weight-for-length _Z score among children_
younger than 1 year (β coefficient –0·18, 95% CI
–0·36 to –0·0058; p=0·04) and positive effects on
reported household water treatment (RD 0·12, 95% CI
0·061–0·18; p<0·0001), presence of improved sanitation
facility (0·089, 0·021–0·16; p=0·01), and presence of a
structurally complete sanitation facility (0·062,
0·0057–0·12; p=0·03). For those who reported attending
all 20 sessions, the per-protocol analysis suggested
positive effects on reported household water treatment
(RD 0·20, 95% CI 0·12–0·28; p<0·0001), presence of
improved sanitation facility (0·14, 0·053–0·22; p=0·001),
and presence of structurally complete sanitation facility
(0·075, 0·0014–0·15; p=0·046). No other differences
were noted.

### Discussion
The findings of our cluster-randomised trial indicate
that community health clubs, as implemented under
Rwanda’s national CBEHPP campaign in this setting in
western Rwanda, had no effect on health outcomes
(diarrhoea and anthropometric measures) or faecal
contamination of household drinking water. Our results
suggest positive effects on several intermediate
outcomes, including reported household water
treatment and type and structure of sanitation facilities.
A somewhat higher proportion of households in villages
assigned the Classic intervention reported treating their
drinking water, and were seen to have improved and
completed the structure of sanitation facilities, compared
with households in villages assigned the control.
However, these augmented intermediate outcomes did
not lead to decreases in caregiver-reported prevalence of
diarrhoea or improvements in children’s nutritional
status.

The increased prevalence of reported household
water treatment did not translate into a difference in
water quality, as measured by the number of
thermotolerant coliforms per 100 mL water. The
reasons for this discrepancy are not clear, but could be
attributable to social desirability bias in self-reported
treatment of drinking water. Respondents in
intervention villages might have learned that they
should be using adequate methods but were not actually
using those methods. This theory is supported by data
showing no association between self-reported
household water treatment and water quality. The
results suggest a need for studies to use quantitative


-----

measurement of water quality to validate self-reports of
household water treatment.

Per-protocol analysis of data from villages allocated the
Classic intervention confirmed no effect on health
outcomes or household water quality with self-reported
attendance at all 20 sessions. Among intermediate
outcomes, results suggested a dose-response relation
with reported household water treatment and type and
structure of sanitation facilities, but no effect on other
key behaviours such as handwashing with soap and
water. Results from any per-protocol analysis should be
viewed with caution because of the risk of bias.[22] People
who were committed enough to attend community
health club sessions might have been more likely to
adhere to the target practices, irrespective of the
intervention. Nevertheless, we judge that the per-protocol
analysis confirmed the intention-to-treat analysis at the
household level.

The absence of effect on height-for-age and weightfor-height Z scores might be attributable to the fact that
the WASH components (the main targets of this
intervention) are just one of many factors that might
affect the nutritional status of a young child. The mean
weight-for-height _Z score for children younger than_
5 years in this population is 0·07 (0·99), which means
that children are in line with the global reference
population, with limited scope for measurable
improvements. With respect to determinants of child
nutrition, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding for
infants younger than 6 months in Rwanda is the
highest in the world,[23] and achieving additional
substantial effects in this context would be difficult.
Minimum dietary diversity among children aged
6–23 months, on the other hand, is low in this
population, but we note that the community health club
curriculum related to nutrition and diet is not fully
aligned with global infant and young child feeding
guidelines,[24,25] hence an absence of effect might not be
surprising.

Our results point to several characteristics of this
population that merit further attention. First, diarrhoea
prevalence remains fairly high among children younger
than 5 years. Second, the high prevalence of stunting
alongside the low prevalence of wasting suggests that
chronic undernutrition, but not acute malnutrition, is
widespread among children younger than 5 years. The
absence of acute malnutrition in a context of relatively
high food insecurity, as measured by the household
hunger scale, is surprising. Our results suggest that
families could be accessing and providing their children
with adequate calories but inadequate dietary diversity.
Since both disease and inadequate dietary intake are
immediate causes of undernutrition, programmes that
reduce diarrhoea prevalence and increase dietary diversity
could also reduce stunting.[26] Finally, coverage of improved
sanitation remains low, and handwashing stations remain
almost non-existent among our study households


Very little evidence exists on the effectiveness of the
community health club or other community group-based
models for health outcomes. In a previous study, the
researchers concluded that the classic community health
club intervention approach had potential to increase
demand for sanitation and change related behaviours,
but that study did not have a rigorous design that would
have allowed for attribution to the intervention.[11] Our
results were similar with respect to sanitation but
differed with respect to other behaviours such as


-----

handwashing, and we saw no effect on diarrhoea or
anthropometric measures. Few other studies have
examined the effectiveness of community-group-based
models for health outcomes, with the exception of
women’s groups for maternal and neonatal survival.[27]

Our results suggest that the community health club
approach alone could be insufficient and that alternative
or supplemental approaches might be needed to reduce
the prevalence of diarrhoea in this population. For
example, programmes could consider distributing
water disinfection or filtration products to improve
water quality.[28,29] Innovative approaches are needed to
promote the presence of improved sanitation facilities
and handwashing with soap, both of which are
associated inversely with diarrhoea prevalence.[29–32]
Alternatively, an integrated agriculture and nutrition
approach has shown success in reducing the prevalence
of diarrhoea in young children in Burkina Faso; further
research is needed on the effectiveness of this
intervention in other settings.[7] In general, future
programmes should promote intervention adherence
and should actively target households for which the
need is greatest.[33]

A key limitation of this study is the reliance on selfreported data for several variables, including diarrhoea,
treatment of drinking water, disposal of child faeces,
infant and young child feeding practices, and attendance
at community health club sessions. Limitations of the
per-protocol analysis include that it is prone to bias and
that compliance is not easily defined. The per-protocol
analysis could be particularly at risk of bias because of the
use of self-reported data for attendance. We were able to
reduce the risk of bias in the per-protocol analysis by
adjusting for baseline differences, but results nevertheless
need to be treated with caution. Finally, we did not assess
the quality of delivery of the programme. Poor delivery
could offer an explanation for the lack of an effect.[34–36]

The community health club model, as implemented
under the CBEHPP in this setting in western Rwanda,
had no effect on any main outcomes. Neither did it
achieve the broader aims of the CBEHPP campaign,
including zero open defecation and at least 80% hygienic
latrine coverage. It had mixed results with respect to
health behaviours, achieving positive results in some
outcomes (eg, coverage of improved sanitation and type
and structure of sanitation facility) but not in others
(eg, handwashing with soap and water). Our results are
strictly generalisable only to Rusizi district, but they are
probably relevant to the rest of Rwanda; therefore, they
raise questions about the value of implementing this
intervention at scale with the goal of improving health
outcomes.
