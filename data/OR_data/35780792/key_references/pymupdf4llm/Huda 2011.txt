Introduction


### a b s t r a c t

Started in 2007, the Sanitation Hygiene Education and Water Supply in Bangladesh (SHEWA-B) project
aims to improve the hygiene, sanitation and water supply for 20 million people in Bangladesh, and thus
reduce disease among this population. This paper assesses the effectiveness of SHEWA-B on changing
behaviors and reducing diarrhea and respiratory illness among children < 5 years of age. We assessed
behaviors at baseline in 2007 and after 6 months and 18 months by conducting structured observation of
handwashing behavior in 500 intervention and 500 control households. In addition we conducted spot
checks of water and sanitation facilities in 850 intervention and 850 control households. We also
collected monthly data on diarrhea and respiratory illness from 500 intervention and 500 control
households from October 2007 to September 2009. Participants washed their hands with soap < 3% of
the time around food related events in both intervention and control households at baseline and after 18
months. Washing both hands with soap or ash after cleaning a child’s anus increased from 22% to 36%,
and no access to a latrine decreased from 10% to 6.8% from baseline to 18 months. The prevalence of
diarrhea and respiratory illness, among children <5 years of age were similar in intervention and control
communities throughout the study. This large scale sanitation, hygiene and water improvement programme resulted in improvements in a few of its targeted behaviors, but these modest behavior changes
have not yet resulted in a measurable reduction in childhood diarrhea and respiratory illness.

In 2008, an estimated 1.3 million children <5 years of age died
globally, including an estimated 20,000 in Bangladesh, due to
diarrheal diseases. An additional 1.6 million children <5 years died
due to pneumonia, including an estimated 26,000 in Bangladesh
(Black et al., 2010). Numerous small scale interventions focused on
improving hygiene practices and water treatment have been
effective in reducing child diarrhea (Clasen, Roberts, Rabie,
Schmidt, & Cairncross, 2006; Curtis & Cairncross, 2003; Ejemot,
Ehiri, Meremikwu, & Critchley, 2008; Fewtrell et al., 2005; Luby
et al., 2005; Shahid, Greenough, Samadi, Huq, & Rahman, 1996)
and handwashing interventions with soap have reduced acute
respiratory illness (Luby et al., 2005; Rabie & Curtis, 2006). There is
also evidence that water storage and sanitation interventions

targeting up to a few thousand households can reduce diarrhea
(Daniels, Cousens, Makoae, & Feachem, 1990; Doocy & Burnham,
2006; Fewtrell et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 2001).
Many available, affordable and effective interventions linked to
improved child health do not reach children in greatest need, due to
difficulties in scaling up. Scaling up refers to the increased financial,
human and capital resources required to expand coverage of locally
tested pilot or experimental interventions so that benefits will
increase and be shared with a larger target population (Mangham &
Hanson, 2010; Simmons, Fajans, & Ghiron, 2007). Difficulties in
scaling up proven effective interventions include weakness in
delivery systems, inappropriate delivery strategies, limited
resources, difficulties in estimating resource requirements and
spending those resources effectively and efficiently, and the short
timeframe for planning, implementing, integrating, and sustaining
the interventions (Mangham & Hanson, 2010; Victora, Hanson,
Bryce, & Vaughan, 2004). However, historically, large scale interventions have not been rigorously evaluated, and their health
impact is unclear (Bajracharya, 2003; Biran et al., 2009; Bowen

et al., 2007; Nanan, White, Azam, Afsar, & Hozhabri, 2003). In
Myanmar, the National Sanitation Week and Social Mobilization for
Sanitation and Hygiene programme contributed to a significant
increase in access to sanitary means of excreta disposal and
handwashing with soap and water after defecation, but no health
outcome was measured (Bajracharya, 2003). An evaluation of
a water, sanitation and hygiene programme implemented in
Pakistan showed a significant reduction in diarrhea, but this evaluation did not capture the interim behaviors that lead to reduction
in diarrhea (Nanan et al., 2003). Overall, it remains unclear if
interventions that have resulted in less diarrhea and acute respiratory illness in children <5 years of age in carefully controlled
trials, targeting up to a few thousand households, can still achieve
a similar level of health benefits when taken to a large scale.
In 2007 the Government of Bangladesh launched the Sanitation,
Hygiene Education and Water Supply in Bangladesh Programme
(SHEWA-B), an intervention funded by the United Kingdom’s
Department for International Development (DFID), with technical
support from United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). SHEWA-B,
a large scale 5 year programme, targets 20 million rural people
and aims to improve standards of hygiene practices and behavior
on a sustainable basis, while ensuring adequate sanitation and safe
water supply. The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease
Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) was requested to design and
conduct a rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of SHEWA-B
(Halder et al., 2010; Luby et al., 2009). This paper assesses the
effectiveness of SHEWA-B on changing targeted behaviors and its
impact on diarrhea and respiratory illness among children < 5
years of age after first 18 months of implementation.

Methods

Study population

The SHEWA-B program targeted 68 sub-districts in 19 districts.
The government and UNICEF selected the specific intervention subdistricts because of the perceived need and the absence of other
active programs addressing water, sanitation and hygiene in these
communities. Sub-districts are further subdivided into unions. To
select the assessment population, we first listed all unions, the
smallest administrative unit in Bangladesh, comprised of a number
of villages, under their sub-district and district location. Then we
randomly selected 50 unions where the probability of selection was
proportional to the size of the union. In each union, a group of 10e17
households from a randomly selected village was considered
a cluster. For each SHEWA-B sub-district where we chose a union for
evaluation we selected a control sub-district that had similar geography, hydrogeology, infrastructure, agricultural productivity, and
household construction, and where the government confirmed that
no other major water-sanitation-hygiene programs were ongoing.
Once a union was selected, the research field team selected
a village from an enumerated list of the union villages using
a random number generator. We traveled to the selected village,
asked residents to identify the village centre, and then enrolled the
first closest eligible household. A household was considered
eligible if it had a child <5 years of age and a guardian of the child
agreed to participate in the study. To enroll the next household, we
skipped the next two closest households, and then looked for the
next closest eligible household. The process for enrolling the next
closest household was repeated until the sample size from the
selected union starting point was met.
We calculated required sample sizes for different survey
components considering the outcome indicators of interest for each
component. For the structured observation of handwashing with
soap, we estimated a baseline of 28% that would increase to 43% after


2 years of intervention. For the cross sectional survey we estimated
the proportion of households using their own or shared latrine to be
66% at baseline and increasing to 75% after 2 years of intervention.
For calculating the sample size to measure diarrhea prevalence in
the last 15 days we estimated 25% at baseline decreasing to 17.5%
after 2 years of intervention. While calculating the sample size, we
assumed 80% power, 95% confidence and a design effect of 2 to offset
village level clustering. We aimed to enroll 1000 households for
structured observations, 1700 household for the cross sectional
survey and 1000 households for diarrhea surveillance, all equally
split between intervention and control communities.

SHEWA-B intervention

Based on a large three year pilot program (Eusuf and Associates,
2006), the project engaged local residents, under the guidance of
local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), to develop their own
community action plans, including targets for improvements in
latrine coverage and usage; access to and use of arsenic-free water;
and improved hygiene practices, especially handwashing with soap.
SHEWA-B trained and recruited more than 10,000 local residents
who had at least 10 years of schooling to serve as community hygiene
promoters. These promoters received 10 days of training on behavior
change communication materials related to water, sanitation and
hygiene. They visited households, facilitated courtyard meetings and
organized social mobilization activities. These included water, sanitation and hygiene fairs, village theater, and group discussions in tea
stalls, the social meeting point for village men. During the promotional activities the promoters used flip charts and flash cards. The
messages alerted participants to the presence of unobservable
“germs” in their home environment and practices that would minimizetheimpactofgermsonthehealthof thefamily.The promotional
activities were intended to encourage active participation of the
community members. Each community hygiene promoter was
expected to reach an average of 2000 individuals every two months
through household visits and courtyard meetings. Since SHEWA-B
was a programme implemented at large scale, the position of the
community hygiene promoters was considered as an intermediate
between volunteers and paid staff, so that their incentive was
affordable to the local government. Incentives included prestige as
well as a modest salary, approximately 1 US dollar per day, which is
approximately one half that of an unskilled laborer. The community
hygiene promoters were trained to deliver 11 key messages (Box 1).

Key outcome indicators

UNICEF and the Government of Bangladesh were particularly
interested in the impact the program had on diarrhea and respiratory illness among children <5 years of age. Key behavioral
indicators targeted by SHEWA-B that may affect these health
outcomes include handwashing, latrine use, feces and waste
disposal, and water storage (Curtis et al., 1995; Lanata, Huttly, &
Yeager, 1998; LeBaron et al., 1990; Roberts et al., 2001; Stanton &
Clemens, 1987; Traore et al., 1994).

Data collection

The research assistants collected baseline data in 2007 from
intervention and control households. To provide early feedback on
the effectiveness of the intervention efforts in intervention
households, we conducted an interim assessment after 6 months of
promotional activities. In 2009, after approximately 18 months of
promotional activities, data were collected from a different
randomly selected set of intervention and control households.

Structured observation

The research assistants conducted 5 h of structured observation
of handwashing and child feces disposal behaviors of all persons in
the selected households from 9 AM to 2 PM. This time was
considered culturally acceptable for visitors and the usual time for
a range of personal hygiene and food preparation behaviors. Using
a pretested instrument the field team noted behaviors at key
handwashing opportunities, such as after own or child’s defecation,
prior to preparing and serving food, prior to eating and feeding
a child. The research assistants noted whether the household
residents washed their hands or not, and if so, if they used water
only, soap, and/or ash. Within each household, during the 5 h of
observation, research assistants often observed multiple occasions
of the same opportunity for handwashing and recorded each
episode separately.

Cross sectional survey

After completing all the household observations the research
assistants returned to administer a cross-sectional survey and
perform a spot check. The cross sectional survey included demographic information, data on households’ hygiene, sanitation, water
supply status, as well as household construction and possessions to
permit a measurement of acquired household wealth. The spot
checks included information on type of household water and
sanitation infrastructures.

Monthly surveillance

We recruited and trained one educated female resident from
each evaluation community to collect information on disease
burden. These community monitors visited each enrolled household each month for 24 months after baseline, and administered
a brief questionnaire. This monthly surveillance questionnaire
included information on any episodes of acute respiratory illness
and diarrhea of each child <5 years of age during the two days
preceding the interview.

Measurement of indicators

We classified improved latrines using the WHO/UNICEF Joint
Monitoring Programme definitions (WHO & UNICEF, 2008). We
considered lack of access to a latrine as reported by the respondent


and verified by spot check of the household as an indicator of open
defecation. Any latrine was considered clean if no feces were
observed in and around the slab of the latrine. We classified
disposal of child’s feces as appropriate if feces were observed to be
disposed in a toilet or in a specific pit.
We classified a household as having appropriate solid waste
disposal if it had either a drum or a specific pit, and our survey team
visually confirmed that household solid waste was disposed there,
with no waste observed outside the pit or drum. We classified
water drainage as appropriate if a household had either a drain
(constructed with or without concrete and cement) or a soak pit.
We considered a household to store water in a covered container if
all the containers found in the house were fully covered at the time
of visit to the household.
We classified acute respiratory illness as having cough and fever
or difficulty breathing and fever within 48 h prior to interview
(Alam, Henry, & Rahaman, 1989; Boerma, Black, Sommerfelt,
Rutstein, & Bicego, 1991; Zafar, Luby, & Mendoza, 2010). Diarrhea
was defined as the passage of 3 or more loose or watery stools in
the preceding 24 h period and we collected data on episodes of
diarrhea in the 48 h prior to interview.

Statistical methods

We evaluated the change in outcome indicators related to water
use, sanitation and hygiene between the baseline and follow-up
within the intervention communities and compared these differences to any differences observed in the control group during the
same period using linear mixed effect logistic regression. We
allowed for random effects within village cluster and within
household nested in the village. The logistic regression models
consist of main effects for: 1) intervention or control study groups;
2) time of data collection; baseline or 18 months; and 3) interaction
between 1 and 2.
To account for the repeated observations for diarrhea and acute
respiratory illness in single households and the clustering of
observations in villages, we used generalized estimated equations
to calculate the cluster adjusted P values and 95% confidence
intervals.
To analyze the data on behavior change we used STATA software
version 10 for linear mixed effect logistic regression analysis. We
used SAS for Windows, (PROC GENMOD) Version 9.1 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA) for the generalized estimated equations modeling to
analyze the data on health outcome.

Human subject protection

All study participants provided written informed consent. The
Government of Bangladesh Department of Public Health Engineering and UNICEF approved the evaluation. ICDDR,B administration provided an expedited approval of the study.

Results

There was little difference in social and demographic characteristics between the intervention and control households both at
baseline and 18 months (Table 1).
Participants washed their hands with soap < 3% of the time
around food related events, including before preparing food, before
serving/handling food, before eating and before feeding a child, at
baselineand after 18 months. There was no significant difference in
food related hand washing behavior from baseline to 18 months in
the intervention group compared with the control group (Table 2).
Residents of intervention households increased the frequency
that they washed both hands with soap or ash after cleaning

a child’s anus from 22% at baseline to 36% at 18 months assessment.
Residents of control households increased the frequency that they
washed both hands with soap or ash after cleaning a child’s anus
from 24% at baseline to 27% at 18 months. The improvement in the
frequency of washing both hands with soap or ash after cleaning
a child’s anus in the intervention group was significantly greater
than the improvement in the control group (P < 0.05) (Table 2).
Residents of intervention households increased the frequency
that they washed both hands with soap or ash after defecation
from 17% at baseline to 30% at 18 months. Residents of control
households increased the frequency that they washed both
hands with soap or ash after defecation from 18% at baseline to
23% at 18 months. The improvement in handwashing after
defecation in the intervention group was not significantly greater
than the improvement observed in the control group (P ¼ 0.20)
(Table 2).
During the baseline, spot checks identified that 10.3% of
households in intervention areas had no access to latrine. This
decreased to 6.8% after 18 months, and was significantly greater
than in the control communities (P < 0.05) (Table 2).
The proportion of households with latrines with no visible feces
on and around the slab, appropriate disposal of child feces, and
drinking water stored in a covered container improved from
baseline to 18 months in the intervention communities. Similar
improvements were also seen in the control communities, so there
was no significant difference between intervention and control
communities. Other indicators related with access to improved
latrines, solid waste disposal and drainage systems, and covered
containers for water storage did not improve significantly in the
intervention communities when compared with control communities (Table 2).


The prevalence of childhood diarrhea and respiratory illness
was similar in the intervention and control communities. Overall,
during monthly visits during the first 24 months, 10.1% of children
<5 years of age living in intervention communities were reported
to have diarrhea in the preceding two days compared to 9.9% of
children <5 years living in control communities (P ¼ 0.56) (Fig. 1).
Similarly, 12.6% of children <5 years in the intervention areas had
respiratory illness on monthly visits compared to 13.0% in the
control area (P ¼ 0.61) (Fig. 2).

Discussion

After 18 months of promoting key behaviors related to sanitation, hygiene, and safe water, targeting 20 million rural Bangladeshis, the improvements observed for a few key behaviors were
modest. These included an increase in washing both hands with
soap/ash after cleaning a child’s bottom, a decrease in the number
of households lacking access to a latrine, and an increase in storage
of drinking water in containers. Our evaluation of SHEWA-B
included matched intervention and non-intervention control
groups, all with similar socio-demographic characteristics,
increasing the likelihood that these improvements were due to the
intervention. However, our evaluation found, at this stage, no
reduction in the prevalence of diarrhea or respiratory disease
among children <5 years of age in the households from the intervention areas. These data suggest that SHEWA-B has not yet
improved behaviors related to handwashing, latrine use, feces and
waste disposal, and water storage sufficiently to lead to a detectable
decrease in diarrhea and acute respiratory illness.
The lack of a measurable impact on the majority of targeted
outcomes was not because of low statistical power. The sample size

was sufficient to detect expected effects of the intervention, and the
baseline estimates for each indicator were based on the pilot study
conducted prior to SHEWA-B in the similar areas of Bangladesh.
There is little available published literature as to how best to
scale up successful small scale water, sanitation and hygiene
promotion interventions and still obtain a similar level of health
benefit. Previous hand washing intervention trials with several
thousand enrolled households found significant reductions in
diarrhea and respiratory illness, but those studies often provided
free soap with frequent community meetings and weekly household visits (Han & Hlaing, 1989; Khan, 1982; Luby et al., 2005; Luby
et al., 2004; Stanton & Clemens, 1987). For example, an evaluation
in a refugee camp setting suggested that improved water storage
reduced the risk of diarrhea by 31% (Roberts et al., 2001). However,
we were unable to identify any other evidence that water storage
promotion implemented at large scale at the community level
improved health. Only a few studies found sanitation interventions
associated with reduction in diarrhea, and these often provided

sanitary hardware and installation of infrastructure. (Barreto et al.,
2007; Daniels et al., 1990; Esrey, Potash, Roberts, & Shiff, 1991). For
example, a study that used a before and after assessment design in
Salvador, Brazil found a city wide reduction of diarrhea after city
wide improvement in sanitation coverage (Barreto et al., 2007).
There is some evidence of health impact when multiple water
sanitation and hygiene interventions were introduced jointly, but
those were studies of up to a few thousand households and often
had provision of infrastructure (Aziz et al., 1990; Hoque, Juncker,
Sack, Ali, & Aziz, 1996; Mertens et al., 1990; Messou, Sangare,
Josseran, Le Corre, & Guelain, 1997). Assessment of a large scale
integrated package of water, sanitation and hygiene activities
implemented in Pakistan found that the children from nonintervention villages had a 33% higher adjusted odds ratio for
diarrhea compared to those from the intervention villages after 5
years. However, the study used a case-control design so that the
intervention was not randomly assigned. As a result, the villages
that were selected for the interventions were different from the

control villages (Nanan et al., 2003). Another large hygiene
promotion programme conducted in Burkina Faso measured
behavior change, but not health impact (Curtis et al., 2001).
The evaluation findings suggest that SHEWA-B did not yet result
in a measurable decrease in the prevalence of diarrhea and acute
respiratory illness because it did not yet sufficiently improve the
targeted behaviors. When compared with the control group there
were modest improvements in handwashing with soap after
cleaning a child’s bottom after defecation. While significant
improvement was seen in handwashing with soap after defecation
from 17% to 30%, this was not significantly different from
improvements in control areas. Improvements in handwashing
before preparing food or eating were not significant. In over 64% of
observed instances, hands were not washed with soap after defecation and after cleaning a child’s anus. In studies targeting up to
a few thousand households, lower incidence of diarrhea was found
when handwashing with soap was promoted before preparing
food, before eating, and after defecation (Khan, 1982; Pinfold &
Horan, 1996; Shahid et al., 1996; Wilson, Chandler, Muslihatun, &
Jamiluddin, 1991).
While there were fewer households lacking access to a latrine in
the intervention communities compared to the control communities, there were similar proportions of households with access to an
improved latrine after 18 months. In a previous study, reduced
reported diarrhea was associated with latrine ownership (Daniels
et al., 1990).
Eighteen months of SHEWA-B intervention did not sufficiently
improve targeted behaviors nor did it reduce diarrhea and respiratory illness. Perhaps the intervention, as designed, was insufficient to produce the targeted behavior change. The SHEWA-B
intervention promoted hygiene primarily through increasing
awareness and imparting health information, strategies that in
some context have been ineffective (Biran et al., 2009; Scott, Curtis,
Rabie, & Garbrah-Aidoo, 2007). Knowledge is often insufficient to
change behavior. The pilot programme implemented before
SHEWA-B in rural Bangladesh used a similar intervention, and
found marked improvement in self-reported behaviors (Eusuf and
Associates, 2006), but the assessment of the pilot likely overestimated the effect of the intervention, because it did not enroll
a control group and depended upon self-reporting of behavior.
Alternatively, perhaps the intervention design was sound, but it
was not implemented with sufficient thoroughness to achieve the
study targets. SHEWA-B was implemented by local NGOs who were
monitored by local government staff and community leaders.
UNICEF assessed the NGOs’ performance considering financial
management, progress toward community action plan and targets,
and household feedback on community hygiene promoter’s visit.
The assessment concluded that 41 out of 58 NGOs (71%) performed
well enough for contract extension (Personal communication,
Luzma Montano, UNICEF, Bangladesh). However, we do not have
systematic data on process indicators to inform us if the communities were actually reached by the interventions, how often, and
how effectively. As a result we cannot confirm how closely the
program intervention was implemented as designed. Future evaluation of similar large scale programmes would benefit from
rigorous monitoring of the implementation process and coverage.
SHEWA-B targets a large population. Even with 10,000
community hygiene promoters, each person was responsible for
educating about 2000 individuals. Moreover, we do not know
whether 10 days training was sufficient to equip the community
hygiene promoters with the skills necessary to facilitate the
implementation of the community action plans as designed.
How much behavior change can be expected from a large scale
water, sanitation and hygiene intervention? Among the behaviors
that improved after 18 months of SHEWA-B, the magnitude of the


behavior change was similar to other large behavioral interventions. In our study there was a 14% improvement in observed
handwashing behavior after cleaning a child’s bottom compared to
18% increase in a study done in Burkina Faso (Curtis et al., 2001).
There was not yet an improvement in child’s feces disposal in our
study, which may compare similarly to the study done in Burkina
Faso (Curtis et al., 2001). While SHEWA-B did not yet change the
behavior substantially enough to see improvement in health, we do
not know how much change in behaviors is needed. Many of the
significant improvements were seen in the first 6 months (data not
shown), and only marginal further improvements were detected
over the next 12 months. So, additional time is not necessarily
beneficial.
Our evaluation of SHEWA-B was designed to avoid specific
pitfalls identified by earlier researchers (Blum & Feachem, 1983).
First, the SHEWA-B evaluation enrolled a control group carefully
selected in consultation with Department of Public Health Engineering of the Government of Bangladesh, who were responsible
for implementing SHEWA-B and confirmed that there was no
similar intervention ongoing. If there were other broad effective
national campaigns, we would have been aware of them. If any
campaign had been effective in improving hygiene behavior in the
control group we would have seen parallel improvement in the
control group with the intervention group. However, we saw very
little improvement in the behavior of the control group, and so no
evidence of their being a broad national program. We avoided
comparing a single intervention community with a single control
community by enrolling a random sample of 50 intervention and
50 control communities. This provided a sufficient sample size to
permit assessment of the SHEWA-B in a wide variety of settings
that are representative of the target population. The primary
outcome for health was a 48 h recall of diarrhea and respiratory
disease, a recall period that has been demonstrated to be the most
accurate (Zafar, Luby, & Mendoza, 2009).
In this study we have found that prevalence of diarrhea and
acute respiratory illness reduced gradually over an 18 month period
both in the intervention and control areas. Possible explanations for
this reduction include the aging of the cohort, the variability of
diarrhea measurements (Luby, Agboatwalla, & Hoekstra, 2011), and
surveillance fatigue. The community monitors who collected data
on disease frequency were not aware of the hypothesis that framed
this analysis. Child illness in these communities is common and not
shameful, so we would not expect any biases in reporting.
Although, community monitors did not have the same level of skills
as the research assistants employed for this study, they were
carefully trained using simple instruments and their results were
consistent with the very modest changes seen in behavior by the
more highly educated research team.
Handwashing behavior is difficult to assess. Responses to
questions about hand washing are substantially different from
observed behavior and are considered less valid (Manun’Ebo et al.,
1997). Thus data from structured observations have been used to
assess handwashing, but we also collected other measures of
handwashing including spot checks for handwashing infrastructure, measures of hand cleanliness, and reported handwashing that
all showed results consistent with the very modest impacts
observed in structured observation (data not shown). We observed
fewer defecation-related than food-related handwashing opportunities, because we missed many defecation events performed
early in the morning. However, for both intervention and control
groups we followed similar observation timings to collect data. It is
possible that the intervention led the study participants to understand that washing both hands with soap after fecal contact was
appropriate behavior. If so, then in the presence of an observer, the
study participant may have been more likely to wash both hands

with soap because of this social expectation (Ram et al., 2010).
However, a study conducted in India found that the presence of an
observer did not influence study participants’ handwashing practices (Biran et al., 2009), though this may have been such an ineffective intervention that it simply did not affect the social norm. We
attempted to reduce the impact of the observer by conducting
observations for extended 5-h periods rather than shorter time
intervals that have been associated with increased reactivity (Ruel
& Arimond, 2002). Furthermore, we enrolled a new set of randomly
selected households for the post intervention evaluation which
likely minimized the reactivity that could occur from conducting
repeat observations.
The ongoing health impact evaluation of SHEWA-B provides
a singularly rigorous assessment of the impact of a large scale
intervention on behavior and health in the target communities. The
approach of SHEWA-B targeting multiple interventions with
several sanitation, hygiene and water related key messages,
implemented at large scale, was insufficient to change most health
practices and the health status of children <5 years of age in rural
Bangladesh after the first 18 months of implementation. Although
the intervention to date has not reached the majority of its
behavioral and health targets, the commitment to a rigorous
external evaluation provides valuable insights for program donors
and implementers on how this and other large scale intervention
programs can be improved. The 6 month assessment of SHEWA-B
helped to make the programme targets more realistic, while the
18 month assessment led UNICEF and program implementers to
revise the behavior change strategy by focusing on fewer behaviors
and using mass media to support the communication messages.
More research on how to implement proven water sanitation and
hygiene interventions at scale will benefit future investment in
large scale water, sanitation and hygiene intervention programmes.
Additionally, continuing rigorous evaluation and dissemination of
results could help to improve ongoing programs and answer key
questions about how to scale up such interventions effectively and
thereby improve the health of children <5 years of age in low
income countries.
