_Abstract._ We introduced home drinking water disinfection and handwashing with soap in Karachi squatter settlements to evaluate their effect on diarrhea. In April 2000, 150 households received soap, 76 received dilute bleach and
a water storage vessel, and 76 were enrolled as controls. In 2000, among households wealthy enough to own a refrigerator, children in households that received bleach and a vessel had a 73% lower incidence of diarrhea than controls;
those that received soap had a 56% lower incidence. There was no reduction in diarrhea in intervention households
without a refrigerator. In 2001, households that received bleach and a vessel had a 71% lower incidence of diarrhea and
children in households that received soap had a 35% lower incidence than controls. In 2001, the interventions were
equally effective in households that had a refrigerator and those that did not. Both of these home-based interventions
were ultimately effective in preventing diarrhea, but only households of slightly higher socioeconomic status changed
their behavior quickly enough to benefit during the first summer.


INTRODUCTION

Diarrhea is a leading cause of childhood death globally.
The World Health Organization estimates that two million
children died of diarrheal disease in 2001.[1] These deaths were
concentrated among low income families living in low income
countries.[2]

Two home-based interventions, disinfecting drinking water
with bleach and washing hands with soap, have been proven
in multiple small-scale evaluations to decrease the incidence
of diarrhea.[3–6] Water disinfectant and soap are inexpensive
commodities that the private sector can manufacture and sell
to at-risk families, thereby furthering sustainable interventions to prevent diarrhea. However, motivating at-risk families to change their behavior and adopt in-home water treatment and handwashing as routine practice is a substantial task
that typically requires more resources than businesses can
recover through product sales, especially in those communities where diarrheal mortality is highest. Understanding the
pace and process through which families adopt home drinking
water treatment and handwashing may provide insight on
how to promote behavior change more efficiently.
In Karachi, Pakistan, 40% of the population lives in squatter settlements where water and sanitary infrastructure is limited.[7] In these communities, infant mortality is high, and 40%
of all deaths among children less than five years of age are
due to diarrhea.[8] In prior studies, households in these communities that added dilute bleach to their highly contaminated drinking water and stored it in vessels that prevented
re-contamination had markedly less contaminated water than
households with standard water handling practices.[9] Even
households that transferred bleach-treated water to locally
purchased insulated vessels and added highly contaminated
ice, had markedly cleaner water. Families that received soap
and were encouraged to wash their hands had lower concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms detected on their hands
at unannounced follow-up visits compared with families that
did not receive soap and handwashing instructions.[10]

These promising microbiologic results suggested that these
two household level interventions would yield health benefits
t f ili th t d t th T t t thi h th i i t


duced home drinking water treatment and handwashing with
soap in separate neighborhoods in Karachi squatter settlements. We evaluated the impact these interventions had on
the incidence of diarrhea and the time required to change
household behavior to make these interventions effective.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

**Setting. This study was conducted in adjoining multi-ethnic**
squatter settlements in central Karachi, Manzoor Colony and
Mujahid Colony, in collaboration with Health Oriented Preventive Education (HOPE), a non-governmental organization that provides community-based health and developmental assistance in these communities. HOPE field workers were
trained women and men who have completed at least eight
years of education, represented a variety of ethnic and linguistic groups, and lived either in the study communities or
nearby communities.
Only some of the households in these communities had
access to the municipal water supply system. The municipal
system supplied water intermittently, typically for 1–2 hours
per day. At those times, residents turned on electric pumps to
draw the maximum amount of water through rubber hoses
connected to community water taps into their household storage tanks. Some households had their own pump with a rubber hose always connected to a tap so that they could collect
water whenever it was available. More commonly, households
shared a municipal tap with neighboring households, and so
used their own pump to collect water only on alternate days.
Households with no municipal water connection typically
purchased water from commercial water sellers who sold water by the tanker truck or in smaller volumes.
Bar soap was commonly sold in the small stores throughout
these communities. Handwashing, typically with water alone,
is part of regular ritual preparation for prayer, though thorough washing of hands with soap is less common. Children in
these communities routinely bathe daily using a bucket bath.
They remove their clothing, take one or two cups of water,
pour it over their head and skin, lather with soap, and use

HOME-BASED INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE DIARRHEA 421


This study was primarily designed to evaluate whether
bathing with antibacterial soap would reduce the incidence of
impetigo compared with bathing with plain soap. Other elements were added to the study to evaluate the role of water
treatment and handwashing on the rate of diarrhea. The impetigo results have been reported.[11] This analysis focuses on
diarrhea outcomes.
**Interventions. Bleach. Field workers diluted three parts of**
locally manufactured bleach (4.4 mg% sodium hypochlorite)
with 17 parts distilled water, and packaged the dilute hypochlorite into 10-mL reusable plastic bottles. One plastic bottle
of dilute bleach added to 20 liters of locally available water
typically produced a free chlorine residual between 0.5 mg/L
and 2.0 mg/L.
_Imported vessel. The imported water vessel was a 20-liter_
plastic container with a narrow mouth (8 cm), lid, and tap that
allowed easy drawing of stored water while protecting it from
contaminated hands.
_Local vessel. The locally manufactured water vessel was a_
20-liter insulated plastic container with a wider mouth (15
cm), lid, and a tap. During summer months, participants commonly added ice to the water stored in the insulated vessel.
_Soap. Three different variations of Safeguard�_ (Procter &
Gamble Company, Cincinnati, OH) bar soap were used during the study, but since they would be equally effective in
preventing diarrhea, all households receiving soap were analyzed together. At the initiation of the study, half of the families in the soap group received generically packaged, unbranded soap that contained 1.2% triclocarban as an antibacterial agent; this soap was chemically identical to the
commercial Safeguard� product. The other half of the families in the soap group initially received generically packaged
soap that was identical to the first soap, except that it contained no triclocarban. Triclocarban is a bacteriostatic compound that inhibits the growth of some gram-positive bacteria, and so was relevant for comparing impetigo rates, but
triclocarban is not effective against gram-negative bacteria,
viruses, or parasites that cause infectious diarrhea.[12,13] When
supplies of the generically packaged soap were exhausted in
the winter of 2001, and the impetigo evaluation was complete,
commercially packaged Safeguard� was substituted and the
diarrhea evaluation was continued.
**Behavior change. Field workers arranged neighborhood**
meetings and used slide shows, videotapes, and pamphlets to
illustrate health problems resulting from hand and water contamination and to provide specific instructions on how to use
the study intervention. Field workers visited each participating house at least weekly. In visits to intervention households,
they promoted discussion and answered questions about the
intervention, re-supplied families with bleach or soap, and
encouraged regular use of the interventions.
**Study groups in 2000. The study began in May 2000 in three**
different neighborhoods. Participants in one neighborhood
received bleach and the imported vessel. Study workers encouraged this group to regularly treat their drinking water,
but did not encourage or instruct them to wash their hands.
Participants in the second neighborhood received soap.
They were instructed to continue their regular routine of
bathing and hand washing, but to substitute their usual soap
with the study soap. No specific instructions on how or when
to wash hands were provided.
H h ld i th thi d i hb h d th t d d h bit


and practices control group, received a regular supply of children’s books, notebooks, pens, and pencils to help with their
children’s primary education. They received no products or
specific instructions expected to affect their risk of diarrhea.
**Study groups in 2001. The intervention continued longer**
than originally envisioned. Families who moved out of the
study area or dropped out of the study for other reasons were
replaced with neighbors who consented to participate. To increase statistical power, additional control households were
recruited.
Beginning in December 2000, the behavior change messages to households in the soap group were revised to encourage handwashing to prevent diarrhea. Specifically, household
residents were encouraged to wash their hands thoroughly for
at least 45 seconds to remove all visible dirt. They were also
encouraged to wash hands at key times: before cooking, before eating, before feeding a child, after defecation, and after
children came inside from playing outside.
A fourth intervention group was added in a fourth neighborhood in June 2001. This group received dilute bleach and
a locally manufactured insulated vessel. Households typically
added ice to the insulated vessel to keep water cold. Study
workers visited weekly, encouraged regular treatment of
drinking water, and re-supplied the households with dilute
bleach.
**Eligibility. Eligible households were located in Manzoor**
Colony or Mujahid Colony, provided informed consent, included at least one child less than five years of age and two
children less than 15 years of age, had sufficient water supply
for the children to bathe daily, and planned to continue to
reside in their homes for at least the ensuing four months.
Only children less than 15 years of age were followed in the
study.
**Measurements. Trained field workers conducted a pre-**
intervention baseline survey to characterize hand washing
and bathing practices, soap consumption, and drinking water
storage and purification practices. Field workers then visited
participating households each week to collect information on
disease occurrence and, in intervention households, to encourage regular and appropriate use of the intervention.
Diarrhea was defined as three or more loose stools in a
24-hour period. Each week was classified as either a week
with or without diarrhea. A child was considered at risk for a
new episode of diarrhea if they had reported no diarrhea in
the preceding week.
**Laboratory analysis. Baseline drinking water samples were**
collected from the bleach plus imported vessel and the control
households at baseline and evaluated for the presence of thermotolerant coliforms and Escherichia coli using standard
membrane filtration methods.[9]

**Sample size. We calculated a sample size of 75 households**
per group for six months of observation assuming seven episodes of diarrhea per 100 child-weeks in children less than
five years of age in the control group, a 25% reduction in
diarrhea incidence for children in intervention households,
two children less than five years of age per household, a 20%
loss of statistical power from household clustering and repeated weekly measurements, 95% confidence, and 80%
power.

time periods May 1–October 31, 2000 and June 1–October 31,
2001. Analysis for 2001 began one month later because the
intervention did not begin in the insulated vessel group until
June 2001.
Diarrhea incidence was calculated as the number of new
episodes of diarrhea divided by the number of child weeks at
risk. Rates were compared between intervention groups versus control and by household and child characteristics using
rate ratios.
The data were modeled using generalized estimating equations to control for confounding and to account for the dependence of the repeated measures of the same individual.[14]

The dependent variable was the presence or absence of diarrhea in a child week at risk for a new episode of diarrhea.
Model building began with the intervention group predicting
diarrhea, and then other characteristics of the study population associated with diarrhea in the bivariate analysis (rate
ratio <0.8 or >1.2) were added to the model. Only those characteristics that both significantly improved fit and were independently associated with the outcome were retained in the
model. A strong interaction was noted with refrigerator ownership in the 2000 data, so separate models were developed
for households with and without refrigerators. For the 2001
data, a nested correlation structure was imposed where the
correlation of repeated observations of an individual were
treated as a subset of the correlation structure of the household. For the 2000 data, the added complexity of the nested
correlation led to even the simplest models failing to converge. Thus, we used an exchange correlation structure of the
repeated measures of the individual child. We used SAS software for data analysis (SAS System for Windows, Version 8;
SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
**Ethics. Community leaders and heads of households pro-**
vided informed consent. The study protocol was reviewed and
approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Aga Khan
University and an Institutional Review Board of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.


RESULTS

**Baseline. The three study groups were broadly similar in**
April 2000 (Table 1). However, households that received
bleach and an imported vessel were much less likely to have
purchased hand soap in the preceding two weeks, and to have
used municipally supplied water as their principle source of
drinking water compared with households that received soap
or were in the control group (Table 1). The level of bacterial
contamination of drinking water was similar between households in the control and bleach group. Households in the
control group were less likely to have a flush toilet.
Most of the participating households in June 2001 were the
same households from the summer of 2000 that had participated continuously. Of the 148 households that received soap
in June 2001, 126 (85%) were households that had received
soap since April 2000. Of the 80 households that received
bleach and an imported vessel in June 2001, 51 (64%) were
households that had enrolled in April 2000 and of the 130
control households in June 2001, 72 (55%) had been control
households since April 2000.
In June 2001, the groups were again broadly similar, but
with differences similar to those noted in April 2000 (Table
1). Households that received bleach and an imported vessel
were less likely to have purchased hand soap in the preceding
two weeks compared with the other groups. Households in
both of the bleach groups were less likely to receive their
drinking water from the municipal supply than households in
the soap or control group.
**2000 rates. Between May and November 2000, field work-**
ers collected the mothers’ report on diarrhea for 27,348 child
weeks of observation; 26,545 child weeks were at risk for a
new episode of diarrhea. There were 352 new episodes of
diarrhea (1.32 episodes/100 child weeks). Younger children
had more episodes of diarrhea than older children (7.5 episodes/100 child weeks among children <1 year of age, 3.8
episodes/100 child weeks among children 1 to <2 years of age,

1.5 episodes/100 child weeks among children 2–<5 years of
age, and 0.5 episodes/100 child weeks among children 5–15
years of age).
Compared with children living in control households, children living in households that received bleach and an imported vessel had a 29% lower incidence of diarrhea, and
children living in households that received soap had a 13%
lower incidence (Table 2).
In 2000, the difference in diarrhea incidence between the
intervention groups and control occurred almost entirely
within households wealthy enough to have a refrigerator.
Compared with children living in control households that had
a refrigerator, children living in households with a refrigerator that received bleach and an imported vessel had a 73%
lower incidence of diarrhea, while children living in households with a refrigerator that received soap had 56% lower
incidence (Table 2). During 2000, intervention households
without a refrigerator had no reduction in diarrheal incidence
compared with control households without a refrigerator
(Table 2). During 2000, households in the control group without a refrigerator had a somewhat lower rate of diarrhea (1.34
episodes/100 person weeks) than control households with a
refrigerator (1.83 episodes/100 person weeks, Table 2). The
incidence of diarrhea among refrigerator owners who received soap or water treatment was markedly lower than either the refrigerator owners or non-owners in the control
group (Table 2).
Compared with households that did not have a refrigerator,
households that had a refrigerator were more likely to be
headed by a literate father (85% versus 69%), to have a literate mother (52% versus 36%), and to report a household
income >70 US$/month (46% versus 20%).
**2001 rates. Between June and November 2001, field work-**
ers collected the mothers’ report on diarrhea for 34,066 child
weeks of observation; 32,533 child weeks were at risk for a
new episode of diarrhea. There were 446 new episodes of
diarrhea (1.37 episodes/100 child weeks). Younger children
had higher rates of diarrhea than older children (4.1 episodes/
100 child weeks among children <1 year of age, 4.2 episodes/
100 child weeks among children 1–<2 years of age, 2.2 episodes/100 child weeks among children 2–<5 years of age,


and 0.7 episodes/100 child weeks among children 5–15 years
of age).
Compared with children living in control households, children living in households that received bleach and an imported vessel had a 71% lower incidence of diarrhea, children
living in households that received soap and instructions on
critical times to wash hands had a 35% lower incidence, and
children living in households that received bleach and a local
vessel had a 20% lower incidence (Table 2). In 2001, interventions were equally effective in reducing diarrhea whether
households had a refrigerator (Table 2). In 2001, the incidence of diarrhea among households with a refrigerator in the
control group (1.82 episodes/100 person weeks) was similar to
the incidence of diarrhea among households without a refrigerator (1.99 episodes/100 person weeks).
**Time effects. In September and October of 2000, the point**
estimate of the incidence of diarrhea was substantially lower
in intervention households with a refrigerator than among
control households with a refrigerator (Figure 1). In September and October of 2001, the point estimate of the incidence
of diarrhea was lower in intervention households compared
with control households both among households with and
without refrigerators (Figures 1 and 2).
In 2001, children living in households that received bleach
and the imported water vessel and had enrolled in the study
in April 2000 reported lower diarrhea incidence (0.41/100
child weeks) than children living in households that received
the same intervention but had enrolled later (0.87 episodes/
100 child weeks). Reported diarrhea in 2001 was similar
among households that originally received soap in the summer of 2000 (1.25 episodes/100 child weeks) and those that
received soap later (1.32 episodes/100 child weeks).
**Multivariate analysis. Generalized estimating equation**
models of these data, which accounted for repeated measures
and significant covariates, including age, and where appropriate, income, confirmed the patterns seen in bivariate and
stratified analysis. In 2000, compared with children living in
control households that had a refrigerator, children living in
households that received bleach plus an imported vessel and
had a refrigerator had a 59% lower adjusted rate of diarrhea
(adjusted risk ratio [ARR] � 0.41, P � 0.006). Children in

households that had a refrigerator and received soap had
51% lower adjusted rate of diarrhea than controls (ARR �
0.49, P � 0.003) (Table 3). Among households that did not
have a refrigerator, intervention households had no significant difference in diarrhea incidence (ARR � 1.1) compared with control households (Table 3).
In 2001, all of the children in intervention households had
an adjusted risk of diarrhea significantly less than children in
control households. Households receiving soap and handwashing instructions had 29% lower risk (ARR � 0.71, P �
0.002); households receiving bleach plus an imported vessel
had a 70% lower risk (ARR � 0.30, P < 0.001), and households receiving bleach plus a local vessel had a 40% lower
risk (ARR � 0.60, P < 0.001). In 2001, having a refrigerator,
either by itself or as an interaction with the intervention
group, did not significantly improve the fit of the model and
was not independently associated with diarrhea.

DISCUSSION

Preventing diarrhea in settings where it is a leading cause
of death requires both effective technology and effective


methods to change behavior. This study suggests when simple
intervention technologies are rapidly introduced, achieving
the behavior change necessary to take full advantage of these
technologies requires considerable time. After introduction
of each of the interventions, there was a delay of three to four
months before diarrhea incidence among children in intervention households was lower than that of children in control
households.
The field workers were not surprised by this delayed effectiveness, and described three phases of communication to encourage behavior change. First, field workers explained to
participants what the intervention was and why it made sense
for community residents to use it. After a few weeks, field
workers focused on the specifics of how to properly use the
intervention. After a few more weeks, when users both understood the value of the intervention and were comfortable
with using it, the focus of the communication turned to motivating every day, every time use. This last phase of habit
formation required the most time, but these data suggest that
with continued visits and continued encouragement these
habits were adopted.

These results further suggest that some households adopt
new behaviors sooner than others. In these squatter settlements, households that had a refrigerator benefited in the
first summer from either bleach plus the imported vessel or
soap, while households without a refrigerator that received
the same interventions had no difference in diarrhea incidence from controls. Refrigerator ownership is an objective
marker of socioeconomic status, of success in a difficult environment, that is less prone to misclassification than reported level of literacy or income. A similar pattern of differential effectiveness with the interventions was seen when
data were stratified by father’s literacy or monthly household
income >70US$. However, the effect was most pronounced
with refrigerator ownership, and once this was accounted for,
reported literacy and income had no further substantive effect. Refrigerator owners had a little more wealth than nonowners, but their drinking water, and their children’s environment remained heavily contaminated with sewage. Indeed, in the control group, children of refrigerator owners did
not have less diarrhea then children in households without a
refrigerator.
Refrigerators do make it easier to keep chlorine-treated
water cool without adding highly contaminated ice purchased
in the marketplace, and this may have enhanced the effectiveness of home water treatment. However, refrigerator
owners also benefited from receiving soap, even before receiving specific instructions on key times to wash hands for
diarrhea prevention. This further supports the notion that
refrigerator ownership identified a broader household characteristic associated with more rapid, effective use of interventions.
Rogers describes the process by which innovation spreads
through a society.[15] First, innovators and earlier adopters,
who typically have higher socioeconomic status, quickly try
the innovation. In these Karachi squatter settlements, refrigerator owners behaved like early adopters, that is, their early
reduction in diarrhea incidence suggests they quickly adopted
the necessary behavior change to benefit from the interventions. If early adopters find an innovation useful, they communicate the value of the innovation to other persons in their
community. As more and more people try the innovation and
find it useful, there are more change agents in the community
who can demonstrate the innovation’s effectiveness and encourage others to adopt. The late majority and the laggards
are the latest groups and the most difficult to change. They
typically have lower socioeconomic status, and learn about
new ideas from peers via interpersonal communication.

diffusion of innovation pattern even when the innovations
were provided at no cost. One of the core challenges for
public health is that households that are slowest to adopt
change are typically those with the most precarious health,
the group that would most benefit from intervention. In this
population, the late majority and laggards were ultimately
reached with both handwashing and home water treatment
and safe storage, but not until several months of weekly visits,
and well after the refrigerator owning early adopters had
changed their behavior and realized the health benefit.
This study provides further evidence that in communities
where diarrhea is a leading cause of death, treating drinking
water with chlorine and storing it safely reduces the incidence
of diarrhea. Indeed, the 73% reduction in diarrhea illness
versus control noted in the second summer is a larger reduction than reported in all but one of the prior evaluations of
home water treatment with bleach.[3,4,15,16] The most likely
explanation for this large reduction in diarrhea is that an
effective behavior change intervention was given sufficient
time to reach all of the people in targeted households. Indeed,
if the evaluation had stopped after the first summer, the measured effectiveness in preventing diarrhea (41%) would appear similar to evaluations in other settings. Of course, in
these squatter settlements where drinking water is heavily
contaminated with sewage, an unusually high proportion of
diarrheal illness may be transmitted through contaminated
water. Furthermore, the 95% confidence interval is wide, with
a lower limit corresponding to a 48% reduction in diarrhea,
which is still quite effective but closer to estimates from other
settings.
This study also adds to the considerable body of evidence
that in settings of high diarrhea incidence hand washing with
soap reduces diarrhea.[6] It suggests that for persons of lower
socioeconomic status, providing soap is not enough, and that
specific instruction and encouragement to wash hands at key
times is crucial to achieving behavior change that leads to
measurable health benefits.
In the highly contaminated environment of the Karachi
squatter settlements, there are multiple opportunities for diarrheal pathogens to enter the alimentary tract of susceptible
children. This study suggests that either reducing the pathogen load on hands or reducing the pathogen load in drinking
water will reduce diarrheal disease. This study was not designed for and does not have the power to assess whether
home water treatment or handwashing with soap is more effective in preventing diarrhea. Future research that combines
these two interventions and evaluates how much of their benfit i dditi ld b h l f l

#### 426 LUBY AND OTHERS


There are important limitations to this analysis. First, the
intervention groups represented three geographically separated neighborhoods. There were differences in these neighborhoods, most importantly, differences in their water supply,
differences in the presence of flush toilets, and differences in
soap buying habits at baseline. It is possible that either these
or some other unmeasured difference in the communities
contributed importantly to the difference in diarrhea incidence noted in the different groups. However, the limited
available water quality measurements in the control and
bleach plus imported vessel group in the summer of 2000, as
well as prior research,[9] suggests widespread sewage contamination of available drinking water in these communities.
Moreover, the multivariate analysis confirmed the relationship between intervention group and diarrhea; factors known
to be associated with diarrhea were either included in or did
not contribute significantly to the model.
A second limitation is that the study did not collect data on
the frequency of appropriate intervention use. Our interpretation of the data assumed that the reduction in disease resulted from appropriate use of the intervention. While this
interpretation would be strengthened by supporting data on
levels of chlorine in drinking water and microbiologic measures of hand cleanliness, it is difficult to imagine a hypothesis
other than more rapid uptake of the interventions in households with refrigerators to explain that 1) in the control group
households with refrigerators had a similar rate of diarrhea as
households without refrigerators; 2) in the intervention
groups households with refrigerators rapidly experienced reduced rates of diarrhea compared with controls and compared with households without refrigerators in the intervention groups; and 3) that with time in the intervention group
the rate of diarrhea was the same in households with and
without a refrigerator.
A third limitation is that this study was not originally undertaken to evaluate the hypotheses that there would be a
time delay in the effectiveness of interventions, or that some
sub-group of intervention households would respond sooner
than other households. Indeed, the study was not originally
designed to last beyond six months or to add an additional
intervention group or enroll additional control households.
Thus, these conclusions while consistent across different analytic approaches and consistent with the broader scholarship
on diffusion of innovations, should be considered preliminary,
and should be assessed in other settings.
In these Karachi squatter settlements where diarrhea is a
leading cause of death, this study demonstrated that with an
effective strategy for changing behavior, two approaches prevented diarrheal illness: in-home drinking water treatment
and safe storage, and handwashing. Weekly interpersonal visits for more than a year were effective at changing habits in
nearly all of the study households. Although the intervention
elements are themselves low cost, this approach to behavior
change is prohibitively expensive to scale up to the billions of
persons who live in high risk settings. Thus, the next challenge
is to optimize the methods for behavior change. These data
suggest that a focused effort on at-risk households of marginally higher socioeconomic status might have a more rapid and
cost-effective health impact. This is a group that private business may be able to reach with targeted marketing programs
that recover their costs. Diffusion of innovation theory sugt th t i ti ith th i i t d b h i h


would then be expected to diffuse through communities,
though it might be helped by explicit strategies that target
community opinion leaders.[15] The development and evaluation of this approach holds the potential to extend the benefits of simple interventions to hundred of millions of at-risk
households.
