**ABSTRACT**


OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to determine whether the installation of
equipment for diaper-changing, hand-washing, and food preparation that is specifically designed to reduce the transmission of infectious agents would result in a
decrease in the rate of diarrheal illness among children and their teachers in child
care centers.

METHODS. Twenty-three pairs of child care centers were matched on size and starrated license level. One member of each pair was randomly assigned to an
intervention group and the other to a control group. Intervention centers received
new diaper-changing, hand-washing, and food-preparation equipment, and both
intervention and control centers received hygiene and sanitation training with
reinforcement and follow-up as needed. Families with children in participating
classrooms were called biweekly to ascertain the frequency and severity of any
diarrheal illness episodes. Staff attendance was monitored, and staff hygiene and
sanitation behaviors were observed and recorded monthly.

RESULTS. Although hygiene and sanitation behaviors improved in both intervention
and control centers, there was a significant difference favoring the intervention
centers with respect to frequency of diarrheal illness (0.90 vs 1.58 illnesses per 100
child-days in control centers) and proportion of days ill as a result of diarrhea
(4.0% vs 5.0% in control centers) among the children. Staff in those same
classrooms were reported to have a significantly lower proportion of days absent
as a result of any illness (0.77% in treatment centers versus 1.73% in control
centers).

CONCLUSION. Diapering, hand-washing, and food-preparation equipment that is specifically designed to reduce the spread of infectious agents significantly reduced
diarrheal illness among the children and absence as a result of illness among staff
in out-of-home child care centers.

HE NUMBER OF children who are younger than 6
years in out-of-home child care in the United States
# T
has steadily increased in the past 30 years. According to
the National Association for the Education of Young
Children, 70% of US children are in nonparental child
care and early education settings, spending at least part
of their day with caregivers other than their parents and
in groups of children other than their siblings.[1]

When children are cared for in nonfamily groups,
there is an increase in the transmission of infectious
agents.[2] Otitis media,[3–7] upper respiratory tract infection,[5,8–10] and diarrhea[5,10–14] are early childhood illnesses
that may be acquired in this manner. These illnesses
cause more morbidity[15] and occur more commonly in
children who are in group child care environments than
in children who are reared in their own homes.
Several studies have found that the incidence of illness episodes decreases with age,[14,16–18] suggesting that
early childhood is a “sensitive period” for contracting
infectious illness. Numerous studies have also found that
rates of illness in child care settings can be reduced by
implementing simple hygiene measures such as a handwashing program.[18–22] Carabin et al[23] demonstrated that
the incidence rate of diarrhea was reduced by a hygiene
training and monitoring program and that monitoring
alone reduced the level of bacterial contamination on
children’s and caregivers’ hands. Unlike health care providers, caregivers in child care settings are not provided
extensive training and retraining in the correct method
of dealing with potential pathogens.[21] This deficiency is
compounded by the high turnover of child care center
staff and emphasizes the need for continuous training in
sanitation and hygiene.
Infection-control programs that have been successful
in reducing child care illnesses have had other benefits.
Krilov et al[24] reported that the implementation of an
infection-control program resulted in downward trends
in respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses, number of
physician visits, antibiotic use, and school days missed.
Uhari et al[25] reported similar results in a treatment group
of children who had fewer infections and prescriptions
for antimicrobial agents than did control subjects. Furthermore, infection-control programs in child care have
reduced the costs that are incurred by parents of sick
children and their employers. Cost/benefit analysis has
found a net savings resulting from decreased spending
on alternative child care, physician visits, medication,
and costs that are associated with parents’ time lost from
work.[22]

Although many studies have established a positive
relationship between hygiene training of caregivers and
the reduction of illness, few have examined the contribution of physical factors to the prevalence of diarrheal
illness in child care. Deficiencies in equipment surfaces,
food-preparation areas, diapering locations, and sink
and toilet availability in child care settings may affect the


transmission of pathogenic organisms. In fact, Laborde et
al[26] found that faucet handles were among the most
contaminated sites in child care centers. Other surfaces
that are porous, cracked, or damaged increase the likelihood that pathogens will escape disinfection and allow
transmission, especially when contact with these surfaces is frequent.
The objective of this study was to determine whether
the installation of diaper-changing, hand-washing, and
food-preparation equipment that was specifically designed to reduce the transmission of infectious agents in
child care centers would result in a decrease in the rate
of diarrheal illness among children and reduce their
teachers’ absences as a result of illness while controlling
for caregiver hygiene training. The study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board on Research Involving
Human Subjects of the School of Public Health of the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH).

**METHODS**
The Quality Enhancement Project for Infants and Toddlers of UNC-CH was funded by the North Carolina
Division of Child Development to improve the health
and safety of infants and toddlers in child care facilities
through its support of child care health consultation;
grants to child care providers for health and safety enhancements; and provision of information, resources,
and training for child care health consultants (CCHCs).
A CCHC is a health professional who has interest in and
experience with children, has knowledge of resources
and child care regulations, and is comfortable linking
child care settings with health resources and facilities
that provide primarily education and social services.[27]

Thirteen CCHCs who were supported by the Quality
Enhancement Project for Infants and Toddlers recommended 72 child care centers for participation in the
study. Inclusion criteria were having an infant or toddler
classroom with at least 5 infants or toddlers and a center
director and staff who were willing to (1) complete all of
the paperwork required by the study and (2) allow data
collectors into their programs once a month. Five centers
requested removal from consideration for various reasons (eg, director illness, environmental limitations).
The remaining centers were matched in pairs by North
Carolina’s star-rated licensing level[28] and size. After
matching, 23 pairs of centers located in 21 counties of
North Carolina were randomly selected. From each pair,
1 center was randomly selected as the intervention center, the other as the control. All centers participated for
the duration of the study. For the purpose of testing the
success of randomization, 2 different statistical tests were
used, depending on the nature of the variables used in
the comparison. When comparing dichotomous variables such as classroom type � experimental group, we
used �[2] statistics. When comparing continuously measured variables such as age � group, we used F statistics,


-----

which are analogous to t values. No control variables are
included in these descriptive comparisons.
Most of the centers had only 1 infant and 1 toddler
classroom. Directors were requested to choose 1 classroom for the study. In the case of centers with �1
classroom, the center director selected for the study the
infant or toddler classroom with the highest number of
children of an appropriate age who would likely remain
in the classroom for the entire 7 months of the study.
This process resulted in 2 instances of an infant classroom in the treatment group being paired with a toddler
classroom in the control group. Nevertheless, there were
no statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups with respect to infant or toddler
age group (�[2] � 2.30, degrees of freedom [df] � 1,44, P
� .13). Of importance, at the end of the study, the mean
ages of the children in the intervention and control
classrooms were similar (21.26 and 21.41 months, respectively), and the difference was not significant (F �
0.04, df � 1,361, P � .84).
The diapering, hand-washing, and food-preparation
equipment that was supplied for the study was unique
(the Sabre Group, Inc, Winterville, NC; www.sabregrp.com/
Hatteras/hatteras�collection.htm), incorporating cast polymer tabletops with impermeable, seamless surfacing for
food preparation, diaper-changing, and hand-washing.
In addition, automatic faucets and foot-activated, rollout waste bins for diaper disposal minimized contact
with the equipment by soiled hands, thereby reducing
the potential spread of infectious agents. Providing separate equipment for food preparation, diaper-changing,
and toddler hand-washing helped segregate these activities and reduce the risk for contamination. The equipment was installed in intervention centers before data
collection commenced. Control centers received the
same equipment at the completion of the study.
After the equipment was installed in the intervention
centers, staff in all 46 centers were trained using the Keep
_It Clean training module.[29]_ New staff were trained within
1 week of their being hired. Keep It Clean was specifically
developed for the study on the basis of successful sanitation and hygiene training activities identified by the
CCHCs. The training was intended to improve and standardize the hand-washing, sanitation, diapering, and
food-preparation procedures in both intervention and
control centers by addressing knowledge, attitudes, and
behaviors of child care providers. Pretests and posttests
were collected, and follow-up training was provided by
each center’s CCHC whenever deficits in knowledge,
attitude, or behavior were observed during monthly
visits that were conducted by trained, objective data
collectors.
The centers’ directors were responsible for recruiting
children into the study by providing the parents or
guardians of children in the selected classrooms with a
written summary of the study and a verbal description of


study procedures. At least 5 children at each center were
recruited. Eligibility criteria included that the child be
expected to remain in the classroom throughout the
7-month study period and be �36 months of age at the
end of data collection and that at least 1 family contact
could participate in a telephone survey in English. Siblings were allowed to participate when they also attended the study center and met the eligibility criteria.
Between September 1, 2002, and January 31, 2003,
cooperating center directors recruited a total of 487 potential subjects into the study. Of these, 70 lacked usable
consents and an additional 11 could not be contacted.
Eighteen potential subjects who were contacted had to
be dropped from the study for reasons such as “left
center” or “ineligible” (because of age, other, or unknown reasons). Therefore, illness and attendance data
are based on at least 1 completed parent or guardian
interview for 388 infants and toddlers (Fig 1).
Telephone interviewing began on December 3, 2002,
while recruiting was still in progress. There was no statistically significant difference between experimental
groups in the proportion of subjects recruited after interviewing began. The mean ages of children in the
treatment and control groups whose parents were interviewed in the first interview cycle (F � 1.05, df � 1,185,
_P �_ .31) did not differ significantly from those whose
parents’ first interviews were after the first interview
cycle (F � 1.85, df � 1,160, P � .18). We know that, on
average, control children participated in the study 125.4
days and intervention children 119.0 days. This difference was not significant (F � 1.29, df � 1,369, P � .26).
Neither was there any significance difference between
the 2 groups in the number of subjects (59 control and
62 intervention) who were lost to follow-up (�[2] � 121,
_df �_ 1,369, P � .46).
Children’s illnesses and child care attendance were
monitored by parent or guardian telephone interview.
Participating families were contacted biweekly by the
Survey Research Unit of the Department of Biostatistics
of UNC-CH. The family contact was asked whether, during the previous 2 weeks, the participating child(ren) (1)
had attended the center; (2) had changed rooms; and (3)
had experienced any illness and, if so, what the associated symptoms were. Vouchers for reduced-cost diapers
that were contributed by a major supermarket chain
were provided by the study to child care providers who
used them to purchase diapers for use by child subjects
during the course of the study, saving the parents the
expense of supplying diapers for their children in child
care and possibly reducing the import of pathogens from
homes into both intervention and control centers.
For each of the 30 weeks of the study, a caregiver
weekly attendance form was completed by the center
director and mailed to the study office using a selfaddressed, stamped envelope. The caregiver weekly at

tendance form tracked the attendance of the caregivers
and volunteers in the study classroom.
To ensure that sanitation and hygiene practices remained standard, field data collectors recorded baseline
and 7 monthly observations of the diapering or toileting
of the children and the preparation of food (including
hand-washing in both cases) using a standard form, the
event sampling form. This form had 8 observable caregiver behaviors for diapering/toileting and 9 behaviors
for food preparation. The behaviors followed the recommended steps as presented in the Keep it Clean training.
Most items were scored according to whether the behaviors were performed “adequately,” “inadequately,” or
“not at all” on a 3-point scale (except for behaviors that
logically could be scored only “yes” or “no”), and the
scores were averaged. The observations were communicated to the center’s CCHC, who would visit the center,
if necessary, within the subsequent 2 weeks to provide
corrective guidance. The reliability of the field data collectors and the event sampling form was checked by
comparing the scores of 2 data collectors who were
rating the same events concurrently. Initial reliability
was �85%, and reliability remained at this high level.
Before hypothesis testing, the success of random assignment of classrooms to the intervention or control
conditions was assessed. The data analysis for this purpose was generated using SAS/STAT 8.02 of the SAS
system for Windows.[30] Multivariate analysis of variance
was conducted to determine whether significant group
differences were detected for 14 key characteristics of
the centers and classrooms that could affect the outcomes: (1) teacher/child ratio, (2) center’s star-rated
license type, (3) total center enrollment, (4) total classroom enrollment, (5) age of youngest child in classroom,


(6) age of oldest child in classroom, (7) number of children in classroom enrolled in the study, (8) number of
subsidized children in classroom, (9) number of subsidized children enrolled in study from each classroom,
(10) number of boys in classroom, (11) number of boys
enrolled in study from each classroom, (12) number of
caregivers in classroom, (13) number of relief caregivers
per week, and (14) number of potential caregivers per
week. Four of the 14 variables—mean classroom enrollment (P � .01), mean number of children participating
in the study per classroom (P � .05), mean number of
boys enrolled in the classroom (P � .001), and mean
number of boys participating in the study per classroom
(P � .05)—were significantly different between intervention and control classrooms. Because the direction of
the differences—more boys and more total children in
intervention classrooms—would mitigate against the intervention’s succeeding, these variables did not need to
be controlled for in the models (Table 1).
Incidence density scores were computed for all episodes of diarrhea (defined as any loose, watery stool that
if contained would assume the shape of the container).
A separate episode of diarrhea was defined by an interval
of 7 diarrhea-free days. Review of the distribution of
incidence density scores for all incidences of diarrhea
(mild, moderate, and severe) indicated extreme skewness with an inflated proportion of no (0) incidences.
Proportions for 3 additional variables—number of days
child sick, number of full days child absent from child
care because of illness, and number of full days parent
missed work because of child’s illness—computed by
dividing the number of days by the number of biweekly
telephone interviews times 14 were also highly skewed
with an inflated proportion of no incidences. Therefore,

to assess significant group differences in diarrheal frequency, days ill, full days absent, and full days missed
from work, a Poisson regression procedure in the LIMDEP (limited dependent variable model) software package was used.[31]

Three characteristics of the Poisson distribution that
make it appropriate for this analysis are that (1) there are
no negative values, (2) the data are highly skewed, and
(3) the variance increases as the mean increases. Although our outcomes were entered as raw counts, Poisson regression automatically uses a log transformation
that adjusts for skewness and prevents the model from
producing negative predicted values. This procedure also
allows controlling for group differences in length of exposure to the intervention between children in treatment centers and children in control centers. The distribution of differences that was created by some children’s
leaving during the study and others’ beginning their
center attendance after the intervention had begun was
controlled for by including a variable that was equal to
the log transformation of the number of days of data
collection for each child as a predictor in the regression
models. Data from children within the same classroom
were assumed to be nonindependent. An adjustment in
the covariance structure was made to account for this
nonindependence by estimating a random effect for
classroom.

**RESULTS**
Four Poisson regression models were estimated. In each
case, the predictors included the estimated intercept of
the line (where all of the predictors were equal to 0), the
log transformation of the number of data collection days,
and the dichotomous variable for treatment versus control group. The dependent variables were (1) frequency


of severe diarrhea, (2) number of days ill with diarrhea,
(3) number of full days the child was absent from child
care because of diarrhea, and (4) number of full days a
parent missed work because of child’s illness. Maximum
likelihood estimates of the effects of these predictors
indicated that the children in the intervention group
experienced significantly fewer episodes of diarrhea
(0.90 vs 1.58 diarrhea illnesses per 100 child-days; P �
.001) and were sick with diarrhea a lower proportion of
days (4.0% vs 5.0%; P � .001) than the children in the
control group. No significant differences were found between the intervention and control groups for number
of full days absent from child care or number of full days
parents missed work because of child’s illness.
A similar analysis using data from the caregiver
weekly attendance form was conducted to determine
whether caregivers who were working in the intervention sites experienced fewer sick days than those who
were working in the control sites. The predictors in the
model were the number of days the caregiver worked at
the site, the number of days the site was open for children to attend, and the dichotomous group variable.
Estimates were generated controlling for clustering by
estimating a random effect for centers. In this analysis,
the caregivers in intervention sites reported a significantly lower proportion of days absent from work as a
result of any illness than did the caregivers in the control
sites (0.77% vs 1.73%; P � .001; Table 2).
The final analysis was conducted on the event sampling data to determine whether the diapering and foodpreparation behaviors of the caregivers differed in the 2
groups of classrooms during the intervention period. A
score was developed from the event sampling measure.
First, the reverse score for each item was averaged across
the multiple events sampled at each observation session.

Then a mean across all of the observations was computed for each item. An item analysis was conducted on
the 17 items, and they were found to have adequate
internal consistency (Cronbach’s � � .73). On the basis
of this evidence, the items were averaged to form an
overall score for diapering and food preparation for each
caregiver. Review of the distribution of this variable
indicated adequate normality for an analysis of variance.
No group differences were detected (F � 0.74. df � 1,45,

**DISCUSSION**
We believe this to be the first study to investigate the
impact that physical equipment in child care centers may
have on the occurrence and the duration of infectious
illness among both children and staff. In preparation for
the study, the study staff examined commercially available diaper-changing and hand-washing equipment that
was actually available for use in child care centers in
North Carolina. This informal investigation revealed a
lack of durable, high-quality options. Additional explo

ration revealed that only 1 manufacturer was interested
in manufacturing the necessary numbers of diaperchanging tables and food-preparation surfaces that
matched the quality and the durability criteria that the
study team and the state child care health consultant
had developed. Other manufacturers that were contacted by the study staff declined, citing a business priority for less expensive equipment that would need to be
replaced every few years.
This study has shown that high-quality equipment,
characterized by seamless, impermeable countertops and
touchless faucets and cabinet doors, is associated with
significantly fewer episodes of diarrhea among children
and fewer sick days among staff. Behavioral change
strategies for reducing diarrhea in out-of-home child
care may be more effective if this source of contamination is controlled. Both improved staff hygiene and
sanitation behavior and state-of-the-art diapering and
food-preparation equipment are necessary for optimal
prevention of diarrheal illness.
Two significant differences between the 2 study
groups were noted. The total number of children and the
number of boys were larger in the intervention classrooms. These differences may have reduced the overall
effect of the intervention, because number of children
per classroom is a risk factor, and boys tend to stay in
diapers longer. In addition, control centers were working
hard to get their perceived reward (the free equipment
that they were promised at the end of the study). These
3 factors should have reduced the difference in outcomes between the intervention and control groups,
suggesting that the significant differences in illnesses and
absences that were found favoring the intervention
group are all the more impressive.
Long-term follow-up with reinforcement of correct
sanitation and hygiene behaviors resulted in steady improvement in the correct sequence of the behaviors over
7 months in both the intervention and control centers.
The impact of the equipment can add value to the impact
of training in proper diaper-changing and hand-washing
that was observed in previous studies. Finally, an often
overlooked aspect of many investigations into sanitation
and hygiene in child care is the impact that infectious
illness has on the teacher-caregivers and the resulting
impact on the children. Ill caregivers can increase the
risk to children, not just because they are vectors of
disease but also because their absence results in hiring
less experienced and less well-trained substitutes.
“Health status, health behaviors, and health concerns of
teachers and directors are important determinants of the
quality and continuity of the child care workforce, and
therefore the quality of child care programs.”[32] This
study found that the caregivers in the intervention classrooms were absent less as a result of illness, suggesting
that the combination of state-of-the-art equipment and


high-quality training with follow-up will have an impact
on the overall quality of care.
The study has several limitations. Classrooms were
randomly matched without stratifying for classroom
type. Nevertheless, only 4 of 14 classroom characteristics
were significantly different. In any study of child care, a
movement of children in and out of classrooms is to be
expected. In the case of subjects who missed interviews,
the researchers had to depend on the child care providers to follow up. Attrition from the intervention and
control groups during the course of the study was comparable.
Despite the potential of our state-of-the-art diapering
and food-preparation equipment, the cost of purchase
and installation, averaging $10 385 ($7500 for the
equipment and the rest for installation) per classroom,
may be prohibitive for many child care facilities. One
approach in North Carolina has been for low-interest
loans to be made available for providers who wish to
install the new equipment. Were equipment such as this
to be mass produced, perhaps the unit cost would go
down. Finally, the success of any intervention to reduce
diarrhea and other infectious diseases in out-of-home
child care depends, in large part, on the knowledge,
skills, and availability of trained CCHCs, regardless of
whether appropriate furnishings and equipment are
available. Support for the training, certification, supervision, and deployment of CCHCs in the United States
remains inadequate.[33]
