### Summary
**Background** **Diarrhoea and growth faltering in early childhood are associated with subsequent adverse outcomes. We**
**aimed to assess whether water quality, sanitation, and handwashing interventions alone or combined with nutrition**
**interventions reduced diarrhoea or growth faltering.**

**Methods** **The WASH Benefits Bangladesh** **cluster-randomised trial enrolled pregnant women from villages in**
**rural Bangladesh and evaluated outcomes at 1-year and 2-years’ follow-up. Pregnant women in geographically**
**adjacent clusters were block-randomised to one of seven clusters: chlorinated drinking water (water); upgraded**
**sanitation (sanitation); promotion of handwashing with soap (handwashing); combined water, sanitation, and**
**handwashing; counselling on appropriate child nutrition plus lipid-based nutrient supplements (nutrition);**
**combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition; and control (data collection only). Primary outcomes**
**were caregiver-reported diarrhoea in the past 7 days among children who were in utero or younger than 3 years at**
**enrolment and length-for-age Z score among children born to enrolled pregnant women. Masking was not possible**
**for data collection, but analyses were masked. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at**
**ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCC01590095.**

**Findings** **Between May 31, 2012, and July 7, 2013,** **5551 pregnant women in 720 clusters were randomly allocated to**
**one of seven groups. 1382 women** **were assigned to the** **control group; 698 to water; 696 to sanitation; 688 to**
**handwashing; 702 to water, sanitation, and handwashing; 699 to nutrition; and 686 to water, sanitation,**
**handwashing, and nutrition. 331 (6%) women** **were lost to follow-up. Data on diarrhoea at year 1 or year 2**
**(combined) were available for 14 425** **children (7331 in year 1, 7094 in year 2)** **and data on length-for-age Z score in**
**year 2 were available for 4584** **children (92% of living children were measured at year 2). All interventions had high**
**adherence. Compared with a prevalence of 5·7% (200 of 3517 child weeks) in the control group, 7-day diarrhoea**
**prevalence was lower among index children and children under 3 years at enrolment** **who** **received sanitation**
**(61** **[3·5%] of 1760; prevalence ratio 0·61, 95% CI 0·46–0·81), handwashing (62 [3·5%] of** **1795; 0·60, 0·45–0·80),**
**combined water, sanitation, and handwashing (74** **[3·9%] of 1902; 0·69, 0·53–0·90), nutrition (62 [3·5%] of 1766;**
**0·64, 0·49–0·85), and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition (66 [3·5%] of 1861; 0·62, 0·47–0·81);**
**diarrhoea prevalence was not significantly lower in children receiving water treatment (90 [4·9%] of 1824; 0·89,**
**0·70–1·13). Compared with control (mean length-for-age** **_Z score –1·79), children were taller by year 2 in the_**
**nutrition group (mean difference 0·25 [95% CI 0·15–0·36]) and in the combined water, sanitation, handwashing,**
**and nutrition group (0·13 [0·02–0·24]). The individual water, sanitation, and handwashing groups, and combined**
**water, sanitation, and handwashing group had no effect on linear growth.**

**Interpretation** **Nutrient supplementation and counselling modestly improved linear growth, but there was no**
**benefit to the integration of water, sanitation, and handwashing with nutrition. Adherence was high in all groups**
**and diarrhoea prevalence was reduced in all intervention groups except water treatment. Combined water,**
**sanitation, and handwashing interventions provided no additive benefit over single interventions.**

### Introduction
Over 200 million children born in low-income countries
are at risk of not reaching their development potential.[1]
Poor linear growth in early childhood is a marker


for chronic deprivation that is associated with
increased mortality, impaired cognitive development,
and reduced adult income.[2] Nutrition-specific inter­
ventions have been shown to improve child growth

**Research in context**

**Evidence before this study**
Although malnutrition and diarrhoeal disease in children have
been known for decades to impair child health and growth, there
is little evidence on interventions that are successful at improving
growth and reducing diarrhoea. Several observational analyses
noted positive associations between improvements in water,
sanitation, and handwashing conditions and child growth, but at
the time this study was conceived there were no published
randomised controlled trials specifically powered to evaluate the
effect of such interventions on child growth as a primary
outcome. Subsequent published trials of sanitation interventions
have reported mixed results. Systematic reviews of
complementary feeding interventions have reported small but
significant improvements in child growth. More recent evidence
from lipid-based nutrient supplementation trials has been mostly
consistent with these earlier systematic reviews. Chronic enteric
infection might affect children’s capacity to respond to nutrients;
however, we found no published studies comparing the effect on
child growth of nutritional interventions alone versus nutritional
interventions plus water, sanitation, and handwashing
interventions. Although many programmatic interventions
target multiple pathways of enteric pathogen transmission,
systematic reviews have found no greater reduction in diarrhoea
with combined versus single water, sanitation, and handwashing
interventions. There is little direct evidence comparing
interventions that target a single versus multiple pathways. Only
three randomised controlled trials compared single versus
combined interventions in comparable populations at the same
time. None of these trials found a significant reduction in
diarrhoea among children younger than 5 years who received
combined versus the most effective single intervention.


**Added value of this study**
This trial was designed to compare the effects of individual
and combined water quality, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrient
supplementation plus infant and young child feeding
counselling interventions on diarrhoea and growth when
given to infants and young children in a setting where child
growth faltering was common. The trial had high intervention
adherence, low attrition, and ample statistical power to detect
small effects. Children receiving interventions with nutritional
components had small growth benefits compared with those
in the control cluster. Water quality, sanitation, and
handwashing interventions did not improve child growth,
neither when delivered alone nor when combined with the
nutritional interventions. Children receiving sanitation,
handwashing, nutrition, and combined interventions had less
reported diarrhoea. Combined interventions showed no
additional reduction in diarrhoea beyond single interventions.

**Implications of all the available evidence**
The modest improvements observed in growth faltering with
nutritional supplementation and counselling are consistent
with other trials that report similar levels of efficacy in some
contexts. By contrast to observational studies that report an
association between growth faltering and water, sanitation,
and hygiene assessments, this intervention trial provides no
evidence that household drinking water quality, sanitation, or
handwashing interventions consistently improve growth. This
trial further supports findings from smaller trials that combined
individual water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions
are not consistently more effective in the prevention of
diarrhoea than are single interventions.


but they have only corrected a small part of the total
growth deficit.[3]

Environmental enteric dysfunction is an abnormality
of gut function that might explain why most nutrition
interventions fail to normalise early childhood growth.[4]
Environmental contaminants are thought to induce the
chronic intestinal inflammation, loss of villous surface
area, and impaired barrier function that combine to
impair food and nutrient uptake. Several observational
studies find that children living in communities where
most people have access to a toilet are less likely to be
stunted than are children who live in communities where
open defecation is more common.[5] Intervention trials to
reduce exposure to human faeces can resolve questions
of confounding in the relationship between toilet access
and child growth and evaluate poten­tial interventions.
Improvements to drinking water quality, sanitation, and
handwashing might improve the effectiveness of
nutrition interventions and there­by help to tackle a larger
portion of the observed growth deficit.
In addition to asymptomatic infections and subclinical
changes to the gut episodes of symptomatic diarrhoea


accounted for about 500 000 deaths of children younger
than 5 years in 2015.[6] Approaches to reduce diarrhoea
include treated drinking water, improved sanitation, and
increased handwashing with soap. Although funding a
single intervention for a larger population might improve
health more than multiple interventions that target
a smaller population, data to inform such decisions
are scarce.
Interventions that combine nutrition and water,
sanitation, and handwashing might provide mul­
tiple benefits to children, but there is little evidence
that directly compares the effects of individual and
com­bined interventions on diarrhoea and growth of
young children.[7,8]

We aimed to investigate whether individual water,
sanitation, handwashing, or nutrition interventions can
reduce linear growth faltering; to assess whether
combined water, sanitation, and handwashing inter­
ventions are more effective at reducing diarrhoea than
individual interventions; and to investigate whether
the combination of water, sanitation, handwashing, and
nutrition interventions reduces growth faltering more

than each individual intervention. A companion trial
in Kenya evaluated the same objectives.[9]

### Methods
#### Study design
The WASH Benefits Bangladesh study was a clusterrandomised trial conducted in rural villages in Gazipur,
Kishoreganj, Mymensingh, and Tangail districts of
Bangladesh (appendix p 2). We grouped pregnant
women who lived near enough to each other into a
cluster to allow delivery of interventions by a single
community promoter. We hypothesised that the
interventions would improve the health of the index
child in each household. Each measure­ment round
lasted about 1 year and was balanced across treatment
arms and geography to minimise seasonal or geo­
graphical confounding when comparing outcomes
across groups. We chose areas with low groundwater
iron and arsenic (because these affect chlorine demand)
and where no major water, sanitation, or nutrition
programmes were ongoing or planned by the
government or large non-government organisations.
The study design and rationale have been published
previously.[10]

The latrine component of the sanitation intervention
was a compound level intervention. The drinking water
and handwashing interventions were household level
interventions. The nutrition intervention was a
child-specific intervention. We assessed the diarrhoea
outcome among all children in the compound who were
younger than 3 years at enrolment, which could
underestimate the effect of interventions targeted only to
index households (drinking water, and handwashing) or
index children (nutrition). After the study results were
unmasked, we analysed diarrhoea prevalence restricted
to index children (ie, children directly targeted by each
intervention).
The study protocol was approved by the Ethical
Review Committee at The International Centre for
Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR-11063), the
Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the
University of California, Berkeley (2011-09-3652), and the
institutional review board at Stanford University (25863).

#### Participants
Rural households in Bangladesh are usually organised
into compounds where patrilineal families share a
common courtyard and sometimes a pond, water source,
and latrine. Research assistants visited compounds in
candidate communities. If compound residents reported
no iron taste in their drinking water nor iron staining of
their water storage vessels,[11] and if a woman reported
being in the first two trimesters of pregnancy, research
assistants recorded the global positioning system
coordinates of her household. We reviewed maps of
plotted households and made clusters of eight expectant
women who lived close enough to each other for a single


community promoter to readily walk to each compound.
We used a 1 km buffer around each cluster to reduce the
potential for spillover between clusters (median buffer
distance 2·6 km [IQR 1·8–3·7]). Participants gave written
informed consent before enrolment.
The in utero children of enrolled pregnant women
(index children) were eligible for inclusion if their
mother was planning to live in the study village for the
next 2 years, regardless of where she gave birth. Only
one pregnant woman was enrolled per compound, but
if she gave birth to twins, both children were enrolled.
Children who were younger than 3 years at enrolment
and lived in the compound were included in diarrhoea
measurements.

#### Randomisation and masking
Clusters were randomly allocated to treatment using a
random number generator by a coinvestigator at
University of California, Berkeley (BFA). Each of the
eight geographically adjacent clusters was blockrandomised to the double-sized control arm or one of the
six interventions (water; sanitation; handwashing; water,
sanitation, and handwashing; nutrition; or water,
sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition). Geographical
matching ensured that arms were balanced across
locations and time of measurement.
Interventions included distinct visible components so
neither participants nor data collectors were masked to
intervention assignment, although the data collection
and intervention teams were different individuals.
Two investigators (BFA and JBC) did independent,
masked statistical analyses from raw datasets to generate
final estimates, with the true group assignment variable
replaced with a re-randomised uninformative assignment
variable. The results were unmasked after all analyses
were replicated.

#### Procedures
We used the Integrated Behavioural Model for Water
Sanitation and Hygiene to develop the interventions
over 2 years of iterative testing and revision.[12] This
model addresses contextual, psychosocial, and techno­
logical factors at the societal, community, interpersonal,
individual, and habitual levels.
Community promoters delivered the interventions.
These promoters were women who had completed at
least 8 years of formal education, lived within walking
distance of an intervention cluster, and passed a written
and oral examination. Promoters attended multiple
training sessions, including quarterly refreshers.
Training addressed technical intervention issues, active
listening skills, and strategies for the development of
collaborative solutions with study participants. Promoters
were instructed to visit intervention households at least
once weekly in the first 6 months, and then at least once
every 2 weeks. Promoters who delivered more complex
interventions received longer formal training (table 1)

After the hardware was installed, household visits
involved promoters greeting target household members,
checking for the presence and functionality of hardware
and signs of use, observing any of the recommended
practices, and then following a structured plan for that
visit. For each visit, a promoter’s guide detailed the visit
objective, the target audience, the specific steps, and
materials to be used. Discussions, video dramas,
storytelling, games, songs, and training on hardware
maintenance were included in different visits. The
breadth of the curriculum varied by the complexity of the
intervention. Promoters delivering combined inter­
ventions were expected to spend sufficient time to cover
all of the behavioural objectives with target households.
Promoters did not visit control households. Promoters
received a monthly stipend equivalent to US$20,
comparable to the local compensation for 5 days of
agricultural labour.
The water intervention, which was modelled on a
successful intervention from a previous trial,[11] provided
a 10 L vessel with a lid, tap, and regular supply of sodium
dichloroisocyanurate tablets (Medentech, Wexford,
Ireland) to the household of index children. Households
were encouraged to fill the vessel, add one 33 mg tablet,
and wait 30 min before drinking the water. All household
members, but especially children younger than 5 years,
were encouraged to drink only chlorine-treated water


Non-index households in the compound did not receive
the water intervention.
The latrine component of the sanitation intervention
targeted all households in the compound. All latrines
that did not have a slab, a functional water seal, or a
construction that prevented surface runoff of a faecal
stream into the community were replaced. If the index
household did not have their own latrine, the project
built one. The standard project intervention latrine was a
double pit latrine with a water seal.[13] Each pit had five
concrete rings that were 0·3 m high. When the initial pit
filled, the superstructure and slab could be moved to the
second pit. In the less than 2% of cases where there was
insufficient space for a second pit or the water table was
too high for a pit that was 1·5 m deep, the design was
adapted. Nearly all households (99%) provided labour
and modest financial contributions towards the cons­
truction of the latrines. All households in sanitation
intervention compounds also received a sani-scoop,
which is a hand tool for the removal of faeces from the
compound,[14] and child potties if they had any children
younger than 3 years.[15] Promoters encouraged mothers
to teach their children to use the potties, to safely dispose
of faeces in latrines, and to regularly remove animal and
human faeces from the compound.
The handwashing intervention targeted house­holds
with index children These households received

two handwashing stations, one with a 40 L water reservoir
placed near the latrine and a 16 L reservoir for the kitchen.
Each handwashing station included a basin to collect


rinse water and a soapy water bottle.[16] Promoters also
provided a regular supply of detergent sachets for making
soapy water Promoters encouraged residents to wash


-----

their hands with soapy water before preparing food,
before eating or feeding a child, after defecating, and
after cleaning a child who has defected.
We aimed to deploy interventions so that index children
were born into households with the interventions in place.
In the combined intervention arms, the sanitation
intervention was implemented first, followed by hand­
washing and then water treatment.
The nutrition intervention targeted index children.
Promoters gave study mothers with children aged
6–24 months two 10 g sachets per day of lipid-based
nutrient supplement (LNS; Nutriset; Malaunay, France)
that could be mixed into the child’s food. Each sachet
provided 118 kcal, 9·6 g fat, 2·6 g protein, 12 vitamins, and
ten minerals. Promoters explained that LNS should not
replace breastfeeding or complementary foods and en­
couraged caregivers to exclusively breastfeed their children
during the first 6 months and to provide a diverse,
nutrient-dense diet using locally available foods for children


older than 6 months. Intervention messages were adapted
from the Alive & Thrive programme in Bangladesh.[17]

#### Outcomes
Primary outcomes were caregiver-reported diarrhoea
among all children who were in utero or younger
than 3 years at enrolment in the past 7 days (based on all
data from year 1 and year 2) and length-for-age Z score at
year 2 in index children. Secondary outcomes included
length-for-age Z score at year 1; weight-for-length Z score,
weight-for-age _Z score, head circumference-for-age_ _Z_
score at year 1 and year 2; and pre­valence of moderate
stunting (length-for-age _Z score less than –2), severe_
stunting (length-for-age Z score less than –3) underweight
(weight-for-age _Z score less than –2), and wasting_
(weight-for-age Z score less than –2). All-cause mortality
among index children was a tertiary outcome.[10] Full
details on exclusion criteria, measurement protocols, and
outcome definitions are in the appendix (p 21–27)


-----

#### Statistical analyses
Sample size calculations for the two primary outcomes
were based on a relative risk of diarrhoea of 0·7 or smaller
(assuming a 7-day prevalence of 10% in the control group[21])
and a minimum detectable effect of 0·15 length-for-age
_Z score for comparisons of any intervention against_
control, accounting for repeated measures within clusters.
The calculations assumed a type I error (α) of 0·05 and
power (1–β) of 0·8, a one-sided test for a two-sample
comparison of means, and 10% loss to follow-up. Sample
size calculations indicated 90 clusters per group, each with
eight children. Full details are given in appendix 4 of our
study protocol.[10]

We analysed participants according to their randomised
assignment (intention to treat), regardless of adherence
to the intervention. Since randomisation was geo­
graphically pair-matched in blocks of eight clusters, we
estimated unadjusted prevalence differences and ratios
using a pooled Mantel-Haenszel estimator that stratified
by matched pair.
We used paired _t tests and cluster-level means for_
unadjusted Z score comparisons. For each comparison,
we calculated two p values (two-sided): one for the test
that mean differences were different from zero and a
second to test for any difference between groups in the
full dis­tribution using permutation tests with the
Wilcoxon signed-rank statistic. Secondary adjusted
analyses control­led for prespecified, prognostic baseline
covariates using data-adaptive, targeted maximum
[likelihood estimation. To assess whether interventions](https://osf.io/wvyn4)
affected nearby clusters, we estimated the difference in
primary outcomes between control compounds at
different distances from intervention compounds. We
did not adjust for multiple comparisons.[22]

Analyses were done in R (version 3.2.3). We tested for
the presence of between-cluster spillover effects using a
non-parametric method described in the prespecified
analysis plan.
The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number
NCT01590095. The International Centre for Diarrhoeal
Disease Research, Bangladesh convened a data and
safety monitoring board and oversaw the study.

### Results
Fieldworkers identified 13 279 compounds with a
pregnant woman in her first or second trimester; over
half were excluded to create 1 km buffer zones between
intervention areas. Between May 31, 2012, and July 7, 2013,
we randomly allocated 720 clusters and enrolled
5551 pregnant women in 5551 compounds to an

Outcome and adherence was assessed by a team of
university graduates who were not involved in the delivery
or promotion of interventions. They received a minimum
of 21 days of formal training. The mother of the index child
answered the interview questions.
We defined diarrhoea as at least three loose or watery
stools within 24 h or at least one stool with blood.[18] We
assessed diarrhoea in the preceding 7 days among index
children and among children who lived in enrolled
compounds and who were younger than 3 years at
enrolment and so would be expected to remain under
5 years of age throughout the trial. Diarrhoea was
assessed at about 16 months and 28 months after
enrolment. We included caregiver-reported bruising or
abrasion as a negative control outcome.[19]

We calculated Z scores for length for age, weight for
length, weight for age, and head circumference for age
using the WHO 2006 child growth standards. Child
mortality was assessed at the two follow-up evaluation
visits based on caregiver interview. Length-for-age Z scores
were measured at about 28 months after enrolment when
index children would average about 24 months of age.
Trained anthropometrists followed standard protocols[20]
and measured recumbent length (to 0·1 cm) and weight
without clothing in duplicate; if the two values disagreed
(>0·5 cm for length, 0·1 kg for weight) they repeated the
measure until replicates fell within the error tolerance. We
excluded children from _Z-score analyses if their_
measurements were outside biologically plausible ranges
according to WHO recommendations [20]

intervention or the control group (figure 1). Index
children in 912 (16%) enrolled compounds did not
complete follow-up, most commonly because they were
not born alive (361 [7%]) or died before the final
assessment (220 [4%]). 109 (2%) households moved,
175 (3%) were absent on repeated follow-up, and
47 (<1%) withdrew (figure 1). 4667 (93%) of 4999 surviving
index children were measured at year 2, with
length-for-age Z scores for 4584 (92%) children.
There were a median of two households (IQR 1–3,
range 1–11) per compound. Most index households
(4108 [74%] of 5551) collected drinking water from shallow
tubewells. At enrolment, about half (2976 [54%] of 5551)
of households owned their own latrine; most (4979 [90%]
of 5551 households) used a latrine that had a concrete
slab, and a quarter (1370 [25%] of 5551) had a functional
water seal. Baseline characteristics of enrolled households
were similar across groups (table 2).
Measures of intervention adherence included presence
of stored drinking water with detectable free chlorine
(>0·1 mg/L), a latrine with a functional water seal,
presence of soap at the primary handwashing location,
and reported consumption of LNS sachets. Interventionspecific adherence measures were all greater than 75% in
households assigned to the relevant intervention and
were substantially higher than practices in the control
group. Adherence was similar in the single water,
sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition intervention
groups compared with the two groups that combined
interventions (table 3). Adherence was similar at 1-year
and 2-year follow-up.
Diarrhoea prevalence in the control group was
substantially below the 10% we had anticipated in our
sample size calculations (table 4). Diarrhoea prevalence
was particularly low during the first 9 months of
observations, with evidence of seasonal epidemics in
the control group during the monsoon seasons
(appendix p 3)


Compared with the control group, index children and
children who were younger than 3 years at enrolment
and living in compounds where an index child
received any intervention except water treatment had
significantly decreased prevalence of diarrhoea at 1-year
and 2-year follow-up (figure 2, table 4). The reductions in
diarrhoea prevalence in the combined water, sanitation,
and handwashing group were no larger than in the
individual water, sanitation, or handwashing groups.
Secondary adjusted analyses showed similar effect
estimates of interventions on reported diarrhoea (table 4).
The effect of intervention was similar among the index
children in targeted households (appendix p 10–11)
compared with the analysis that included both index
children and children younger than 3 years at enrolment
who lived in the compound (figure 2); however, the point
estimates of the prevalence ratio suggested that water or
handwashing interventions did not have a notable effect
on non-index children (appendix p 10–11).
There was no difference in prevalence of caregiverreported bruising or abrasion between children in the
control group and any of the intervention groups
(appendix p 4).
After 2 years of intervention (median age 22 months,
IQR 21–24), mean length-for-age _Z_ score in the control
group was –1·79 (SD 1·01); children who received the
nutrition intervention had an average increase of
0·25 (95% CI 0·15–0·36) in length-for-age Z scores; and
children who received the water, sanitation, handwashing,
and nutrition intervention had an average increase of
0·13 (0·02–0·24) in length-for-age _Z_ scores (figure 3).
After about 1 year of intervention (median age 9 months,
IQR 8–10), children in the nutrition only group (but not
children in the water, sanitation, handwashing, and
nutrition group) were significantly taller than control
children (appendix p 5).
Compared with control children, there was no sig­nif­
icant difference in length-for-age Z scores in children

(0·02 [–0·09 to 0·13]; figure 3). Length-for-age _Z_ scores
were similar for children who received water, sanitation,
handwashing, and nutrition and those who received
nutrition only intervention (–0·12 [–0·26 to 0·01]).
After 2 years of intervention, children in the nutrition
only or the water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition
intervention had higher _Z scores for length for age,_
weight for length, weight for age, and head circumference
for age than did children in the control group (table 5).
Children in the water treatment, sanitation, handwashing,
or combined water, sanitation, and handwashing
interventions had Z scores for length for age, weight for
length, weight for age, and head circumference for age
that were similar to controls (table 5).
Compared with children living in control households,
children enrolled in the nutrition only intervention were
less likely to be stunted after 2 years; children enrolled in
the water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition
intervention were less likely to be severely stunted, or
underweight (table 6). The proportion of children who
were wasted was similar between the intervention and
control groups.
Prespecified adjusted analyses found similar effect
estimates on anthropometric outcomes with similar
efficiency (appendix p 12–15). There was no evidence of
between-cluster spillover effects (appendix p 8, 9 and 17–20).
In the control group, the cumulative incidence of child
mortality was 4·7% (figure 1). Mortality in the individual
water, sanitation, and handwashing groups and combined
water, sanitation, and handwashing group was similar to
controls. The two groups with a nutrition intervention had
lower mortality: 3·8% for the nutrition group and 2·9% for
the water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition group;
this difference was significant for the combined group
(risk difference water, sanitation, handwashing, and
nutrition vs control –1·9% [95% CI –3·6 to –0·1]; p=0·0371;
38% relative reduction; appendix p 16).

### Discussion
In the WASH Benefits Bangladesh cluster-randomised
controlled trial, the linear growth of children whose
households had a chlorinated drinking water inter­
vention, sanitation improvements, or handwashing
intervention alone or in combination was no different
than children in randomly assigned control households
that received no intervention. Children in the nutrient
supplement and counselling group grew somewhat taller
than controls. Children in households that received a
combination of water, sanitation, handwashing, and
nutrition had no greater growth benefit than those
receiving the nutrition-only intervention. Compared
with control households, caregiver-reported diarrhoea
prevalence was significantly decreased in households


that received any of the interventions, except those who
received only the drinking water treatment.
The trial’s statistical power to detect small effects and
high adherence to the interventions suggest that the
absence of improvement in growth with water, sanitation,
and handwashing interventions was a genuine null
effect. These results suggest either that the hypothesis
that exposure to faecal contamination contributes
importantly to child growth faltering in Bangladesh is
flawed or that the hypothesis remains valid but the water,
sanitation, and handwashing interventions used in this
trial did not reduce exposure to environmental pathogens
sufficiently to reduce growth faltering. Future articles
from our group will describe the effects of intervention
on environmental contamination with faecal indicator
bacteria and on the prevalence and concentration of


-----

enteric pathogens in stool specimens from children and
thus provide insight on how effectively the inter­
ventions altered environmental contamination and
entero­pathogen transmission.
The effect of the nutrition intervention, which
corrected one sixth of the growth deficit compared with
international norms of healthy growth, was consistent
with other randomised controlled trials of postnatal LNS
that have reported variable and generally small effects


on linear growth.[23–27] This variation is probably because
of contextual factors that affect a population’s capacity
to respond to an intervention. The water, sanitation,
and handwashing intervention did not affect crucial
contextual factors to amplify the effect of the nutrition
interventions in rural Bangladesh. Continued research
should explore interventions to reduce growth faltering.
Although intervention households generally reported
less diarrhoea, people who received the intervention might
have been grateful and, out of courtesy, reported less
diarrhoea.[28] However, compared with control households,
intervention households reported no reduction in bruising
or abrasions (negative control outcomes), so there was no
evidence of systematic under-reporting of all health
outcomes. It also seems unlikely that courtesy bias would
affect each of the interventions except the drinking water
intervention. The nutrition intervention might have led to
improve­ments in breastfeeding practices or in essential
fatty acids or micronutrient status, which could have
contributed to improved gut epithelial immune response
and thus less diarrhoea.[29]

The finding that drinking water treatment intervention
had no notable effect on diarrhoea contrasts with our
previous study of the identical intervention done between
October, 2011, and November, 2012 in nearby communities
that found a 36% reduction in reported diarrhoea.[11]
Restriction of the analysis to WASH Benefits index
children who were targeted for the drinking water
intervention led to a stronger treatment effect estimate
(prevalence ratio 0·80 [95% CI 0·60–1·07]). Diarrhoea
prevalence in the WASH Benefits control group (6%) was
substantially lower than the 10% prevalence noted in a
large prior study[21] and the 11% prevalence in the control
group of our previous study.[11] Diarrhoeal prevalence
characteristically varies substantially in nearby locations
and from year to year.[30] Diarrhoea prevalence in the control
group of this WASH Benefits trial in rural Bangladesh was
similar to diarrhoea prevalence among cohorts of children
aged 1–4 years in the USA.[31] At the time of the study,
rotavirus immunisation had not been introduced into the
Bangladesh national immunisation programme. The
unexpectedly low diarrhoea prevalence among control
children suggests decreased transmission of diarrhoeacausing pathogens during the WASH Benefits trial
compared with recent evaluations. This low transmission
provided less opportunity to interrupt transmission and
less statistical power to show that interruption.
Combining interventions to improve drinking water
quality, sanitation, and handwashing provided no additive
benefit for the reduction of diarrhoea over single
interventions. The unexpectedly low diarrhoea prevalence
suggests low transmission of enteric pathogens through
some of the pathways, which might have prevented any
additive benefit from the combined interventions.
Combined interventions did not compromise observed
adherence to recommended practices. If a substantial
proportion of the reduced diarrhoea was because of


-----

courtesy bias, this bias might mask subtle additive
benefits. The only previous randomised controlled
evaluations of multiple interventions versus single
interventions also found no additive benefit of multiple
components of water, sanitation, and handwashing on
reported diarrhoea among children younger than
5 years.[7,32,33] Because transmission pathways of entero­
pathogens vary by time and location, this absence of an
additive effect with combined interventions is unlikely to
generalise to all locations. However, these findings suggest
that focusing resources on a single low-cost high-uptake
intervention to a larger population might reduce diarrhoea
prevalence more than would similar spending on more
comprehensive approaches to smaller populations.
Children who received both the nutrition and the
combined water, sanitation, and handwashing inter­
vention were 38% less likely to die than children in the
control group. Mortality was not a primary study
outcome. Although the confidence limits are broad and
the p value is borderline (p=0·037), a causal relationship
from the interventions is plausible, since diarrhoea and
poor nutrition are risk factors for death among young
children in this setting. Notably, reduced mortality was
only seen in the intervention groups that saw improved
growth (nutrition groups), which were the groups with
objective indicators of biological effect. Forthcoming
investigations of the timing and causes of death
assessed by verbal autopsy, distribution of
enteropathogens among intervention groups, and effect
of interventions on respiratory disease will provide
additional evidence to assess the biological plausibility
of a causal relationship between the combined water,
sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition intervention
and reduced mortality.
The randomised design, balanced groups, and high
adherence suggests that the absence of an associ­
ation between water, sanitation, and handwashing
interventions and growth is internally valid, but
this intervention was implemented in one socio­
ecological zone (rural Bangladesh) during a time of low
diarrhoea prevalence. Reducing faecal exposure through
household water, sanitation, and handwashing inter­
ventions might affect growth in settings with a different
prevalence of gastrointestinal disease or mix of pathogens.[34]
Notably, water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions
did not prevent growth faltering in this context where
stunting is a prevalent public health issue and where
adherence to the interventions was substantially higher
than in typical programmatic interventions.[21,35,36]

The objective measures of uptake reflected the
availability of infrastructure and supplies, but might
over-represent actual use. Future articles from our group
will include structured obser­vation and other measures
of uptake. Although more intensive interventions could
lead to even better practices, it seems unlikely that
large-scale routine programmes could implement
interventions with such intensity


Because the sanitation intervention targeted com­
pounds with pregnant women, these interventions only
reached about 10% of residents in villages where
interventions were implemented. If a higher threshold of
sanitation coverage is necessary to achieve herd
protection, then this study design would preclude the
detection of this effect. We used compounds as the unit of
intervention because they enabled us to deliver intensive
interventions with high adherence for thousands
of newborn children. In addition, we expected
compound-level faecal contami­nation to represent the
dominant source of exposure for index children because
of the physical separation of compounds, and because
children younger than 2 years of age in these communities
spent nearly all of their time in their own compound.
The combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and
nutrition intervention had sustained high levels of
adherence. Although the full range of benefits of these
successfully integrated interventions are yet to be fully
elucidated, our findings suggest there might be a
survival benefit. Forthcoming articles by our group will
report the effects of intervention on biomarkers of
environmental enteric dysfunction, soil-transmitted
helminth infection, enteric pathogen infection, bio­
markers of inflammation and allostatic load, anaemia
and nutritional biomarkers, and child language, motor
development, and social skills.
