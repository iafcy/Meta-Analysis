Transmission of enteric pathogens is facilitated in child day care centers, including
family day care homes, by frequent and intimate exposure among susceptible hosts,
with diaper changing as the highest-risk procedure for such transmission. The
objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention program
in decreasing the incidence of infectious disease symptoms in children attending
family day care homes during a 12-month period. Each of 24 family day care homes
was randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention
included four components: (1) a handwashing educational program and (2) use of
vinyl gloves, (3) use of disposable diaper changing pads, and (4) use of an
alcohol-based hand rinse by the day care provider. Symptoms of enteric disease
(diarrhea and vomiting) were significantly reduced in intervention family day care
homes (p s 0.05), whereas respiratory symptoms were not significantly different
between intervention and control family day care homes (p = 0.35). Diarrhea was
reported in 1 of every 100 child care days, representing one diarrhea episode per
month in a typical family day care home. (AM J INFECT CONTROL 1990; 18:347-53).

Asymptomatic shedding of specific enteropathogens is an additional source of transmission in children in day care. Asymptomatic excretion of rotavirus in stools occurred in 32%
of children tested during the first week after
diarrhea and in 50% of children 1 day before
diarrhea. This shedding represents a source of
transmission that could potentially be interrupted by handwashing and hygienic diaper
handling.12
Transmission of enteric pathogens through
person-to-person spread or through fomites

Diaper changing has been suggested as the
highest-risk procedure for transmission of enteropathogens among day care children and
personnel.17 Although a rigorous handwashing
intervention was demonstrated in one study to
reduce the incidence of nonspecific diarrhea1
illness in large day care centers,15 few studies
have examined the association of inadequate
handwashing and poor hygienic diaper handling practices on the transmission of diarrhea1
disease in FDCHs.
The objective of this study was to evaluate
the effectiveness of an intervention program in
decreasing the incidence of symptoms associated with enteric and respiratory infectious diseases among 2-month-old to 7-year-old children
attending FDCHs.

MATERIAL AND METHOD8

FDCHs are defined (in Maryland) as registered day care homes that enroll six or fewer
children for part-time or full-time day care.
Forty-seven family day care providers were ran

INFECTION CONTROL

domly selected by number from a list of FDCHs
registered in the city of Baltimore and were contacted by telephone; 24 (5 1%) agreed to participate in the study. Names were obtained from
a list of FDCHs provided by the local Department of Social Services, Division of Day Care.
After signed consent was obtained from day
care providers, each FDCH was randomly assigned to the control group (n = 12) or intervention group (n = 12). To reduce reporting
bias, all day care providers were aware that the
intervention program was being tested in certain homes. Parental consent for recording of
daily symptoms for each child (n = 114) enrolled in the FDCHs was obtained by telephone.
The study was approved by the Human Subjects Committee of The Johns Hopkins University Medical School.
Baseline health data on each child were obtained from the parent by telephone interview
within 2 months of enrollment in the study. All
new children who entered the FDCHs were recruited into the study. Children departing from
a FDCH were not followed after their departure.
Sociodemographic data on day care personnel
were obtained on their entry into the study.
Exclusion criteria for sick children were ascertained from each day care provider before
data collection. Equal proportion of intervention as well as control day care personnel stated
that fever, defined as “forehead warm to touch”
or a temperature greater than 100” F (91%), and
diarrhea (82%) were used as exclusionary criteria for sick children. Other exclusionary
symptoms were reported at lower levels: runny
nose (55%) skin rashes (27%), and cough (18%).

Intervention. The intervention program consisted of in-home instruction to day care providers by the investigators during the first four
home visits. The intervention instruction included modes of transmission of pathogens in
the home, indications for handwashing, and the
use of vinyl gloves and disposable diaper changing pads at each diaper change. Providers were
instructed to dispose of the gloves, disposable
pads, and diapers in plastic bags. Between

were instructed to use an alcohol-based (60%
isopropyl alcohol) hand rinse (Cal STAT, Calgon Corp., St. Louis, MO.). All supplies were provided to each intervention day care provider.
This combined intervention was chosen to maximize any beneficial effects. The control homes
received no educational intervention but received biweekly nurse visits for symptom data
collection.
Assessment of symptoms. Daily symptom records for each child were kept by all day care
providers for a 12-month study period. Each
day the provider recorded the following symptoms for each child: diarrhea, vomiting, runny
nose, and absence from day care home. All absent days, including those for vacation, maternal illness, and days off, were recorded. Reason
for absenteeism was not recorded. If no data
were recorded on any given day, that day’s data
were coded as missing.
Definitions of symptoms were provided to
providers. Diarrhea was defined as the occurrence of loose, unformed bowel movements at
twice the normal frequency. Normal frequency
of bowel movements was further defined for the
day care providers: infants, one to two stools
per day; and older children, one stool per day.
The presence or absence of symptoms was recorded only for days of attendance; no recording of symptoms was attempted in the child’s
home. Every 2 weeks a registered nurse visited
each FDCH to collect the completed symptom
records. All providers, control and intervention,
were remunerated with $2.00 during the biweekly visits as well as an additional amount
three times during the study period for completing the symptom records.
Statistical analysis. The proportion of child
symptom days (diarrhea, vomiting, and runny
nose) was calculated for all children for each
month and plotted across the 12-month study
period to ascertain seasonal trends in symptom
reporting. The trends reported do not necessarily reflect the same children during the study
period. Each month represented an independent proportion of child symptom days. Multiple symptoms are reported as group rates, not
by the individual child. Additionally, a series of


chi-square tests of association were performed
to compare the intervention and control homes
for the number of symptom days reported during the 12-month period (significance level
p = 0.0s).

RESULTS

Population. During the period from Jan. 4,
1988, to Dec. 31, 1988, 114 children were enrolled from 24 FDCHs. From all FDCHs, only
two children were not enrolled. Baseline data
are reported on 108 children (95%) whose parents could be contacted by telephone. During
the 12-month period, 47 children (27 control,
20 intervention) departed from and 19 (8 control, 11 intervention) new children entered the
FDCHs, accounting for 86 children enrolled at
the termination of the study. Two FDCHs (one
control, one intervention) discontinued care
during the 12-month study period, accounting
for 11 of the departing children. The majority
(68%) of children departing from day care left
during the second half of the study period.
Sociodemographic characteristics of the children by type of home are shown in Table 1.
There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups of children by
age, sex, race, maternal age, preexisting health
condition, or number of siblings in their home.
A preexisting health condition, which was reported by 19% of all children, included asthma,
recurrent ear infections, cerebral palsy, ventricular septal defect, chronic constipation,
cancer, and seizures. There were no statistically
significant sociodemographic differences in the
control or intervention providers (Table 2). The
providers tended to be older (mean age 48.5
years), and more than half (58%) had not completed high school.
Symptom reports. During the study period, a
total of 20,587 child days were included (control, 10,428 days; intervention, 10,159 days),
with an average daily census of 100 children
(control, 47.5 children/day; intervention, 52.5
children/day) aged 1 month to 7 years. Absent
days totaled 1727 (8.4%), and missing days totaled 461 (2.2%) during the 12-month study period. Absent and missing days were excluded

The seasonal distribution of diarrhea, runny

Fig. 1; diarrhea symptom report rates peaked
in mid-winter (February) and mid-summer
(July). Vomiting report rates paralleled the
mid-winter peak but did not parallel the midsummer peak. Runny nose report rates also
peaked in the winter months, declined through
the spring and summer, and peaked again during the fall.
Total days by symptom are shown in Table
3. Runny nose reports occurred during 195 1
(9.5%) of all child days. Other symptoms were
reported at lower rates for all child days: diarrhea, 226 (1.1%); and vomiting, 85 (0.4%). Significant differences were observed between intervention and control homes for symptoms of
diarrhea and vomiting (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

Prevention and control of infectious diseases
in day care facilities depends on maintenance
of optimal hygienic standards. Handwashing
by providers is considered the single most important preventive measure” in day care facilities. The results of our study demonstrate that
symptoms of enteric disease (diarrhea and vomiting) are lowered in FDCHs when specific hygienic measures such as handwashing, use
of vinyl gloves, disposable diaper pads, and

alcohol-based hand rinse are used. The relative
contribution of each component of the intervention cannot be distinguished in our data because the intervention was devised to produce
the maximum effect in low-income, inner-city
FDCHs. To test each component of the intervention, a larger sample size would be required.
Further studies need to be undertaken to determine which factor is responsible for lowering
the symptom rates reported in the intervention

ter, was detected for 30 minutes on counter
tops, but the virus survived longer when suspended in fecal ‘material” or at high or low humidity. *’ This suggests that these enteropathogens can remain viable on contaminated surfaces, such as the diaper changing area and
hands of day care personnel, long enough to be
transmitted to susceptible children. Use of vinyl
gloves and disposable diaper changing pads
may explain the reduced diarrhea and vomiting
symptom reports of the intervention homes.
All symptom reports were based on the providers’ subjective assessments. Although definitions were provided, no validity testing was
possible during the study. However, the fact
that seasonal trends were consistent across
homes and consistent with patterns associated
with infectious diarrhea lends credence to the
providers’ assessments. Underreporting rather
than overreporting of symptoms by the busy
providers is more likely in these data. Fever
symptoms were recorded. Initial home teaching
included use of a thermometer to measure fever.
However, because of the providers’ inconsistent
use of thermometers and use of “tactile fever”
determination, the fever data were not reported. With the majority of providers reporting less than a high school education, record
keeping by the providers was designed to be
simple and efficient, to optimize compliance.
Diarrhea outbreaks in day care centers are
generally due to transmission of organisms requiring low inoculum (Shigellu, Giardia lumbIia).** However, the infective dose of rotavirus
is unknown. Placing children in separate rooms

(isolation) in day care centers while they were
receiving therapy for shigellosis was useful in
containing a diarrhea1 outbreak, thus allowing
children to return to day care sooner.7 However,
segregation of potentially infectious children is
not feasible in FDCHs. Rather, excluding ill
children from care is the usual practice. Our
data demonstrate that young children do frequently attend FDCHs with symptoms of respiratory diseases. Additionally, diarrhea was
reported in one of every 100 child care days.
This represents one diarrhea episode per month
in a typical FDCH.
Increased attention to handwashing by day
care providers and the use of disposable diaper
changing pads may reduce the incidence of
diarrhea1 disease. In addition, it would be prudent for providers to wear vinyl gloves for diaper changing or for assisting children with toileting when children with symptoms of enteric
disease attend their homes. It is possible that
certain enteric pathogens will be more sensitive
