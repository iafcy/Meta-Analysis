Abstract-A community-based intervention was developed through direct participation of the target
population in assessment and iterative trials to improve hygiene practices and to reduce childhood
diarrhoea in lowland rural Bangladesh. A total of 185 (98X) households with children ages O-18 months
in five contiguous villages were targeted for the interventions. A comparison site was selected for a detailed
observational study and for use as a control for the intervention. About 97% of all households with
children ages l&l8 months were enrolled for study at the control site. Children in this age group were
targeted because at this developmental stage they were most vulnerable to diarrhoeal morbidity and
malnutrition (related to unhygienic practices). The intervention was implemented with the assistance of
village leaders through a “Clean Life” campaign by local project workers and volunteer mothers who were
chosen from the target households. The intervention activities started in January 1986 and lasted for 7
months. Higher adoption rates of the intervention were associated with better cleanliness status, which
was related to lower diarrhoea and malnutrition rates in the intervention site. The results of between-site
longitudinal analyses showed that after the intervention, the intervention site had substantially higher
cleanliness scores, lower diarrhoeal morbidity, and better growth status compared to those of the control
site, with differences increasing over time. The findings suggest that this type of community-based
intervention can be very beneficial in modifying hygiene behaviours and lowering childhood diarrhoea and
malnutrition.

Diarrhoea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children in the world [l], and has
adverse effects on growth [24]. In Bangladesh, it is
estimated that diarrhoea accounts for up to 60% of
deaths among the 14 year age group [5] and that
90% of preschool children suffer from some degree of
malnutrition [6]. The malnutrition and mortality
rates of children of Bangladesh are among the highest
in the world [7]. In Bangladesh, as many other
countries, diarrhoea is a major contributor to malnutrition [8] and child mortality [5, 91. Poor hygiene
practices and environmental sanitation are major
contributors to diarrhoea **_[IO]._**
In developing countries, most hygiene interventions to reduce diarrhoea have been found to be
either ineffective, unfeasible, inappropriate, or too

was related to lower diarrhoea and malnutrition rates in the intervention site. The results of between-site
longitudinal analyses showed that after the intervention, the intervention site had substantially higher



[ 151. The objective of the interventions was to reduce
childhood diarrhoea by modifying hygiene behaviours, using solutions from within the community.
Many studies evaluate the effect of interventions by
comparing pre-post differences in intervention and
control groups without examining seasonal patterns
of change over time. In contrast, this paper reports
changes in daily rates of childhood diarrhoea,
monthly cleanliness practices, and nutritional status
in both intervention and control communities. This
study also investigates the relationship between the
rates of adoption of the intervention and health
indicators within the intervention site in order to
understand how the intervention may have affected
the outcomes.

area was selected for the program because of its poor
hygiene conditions and high diarrhoea and malnutrition rates [16]. Environmental sanitation, personal
cleanliness, and food hygiene were difficult year
round. These problems were aggravated by lack of
water in the hot dry season (April-May) and too
much water in the flood season (July-September).
The intervention and comparison sites were selected based on similarities in ecological and demographic characteristics, cultural practices, child care,
and hygiene and sanitation behaviours. The intervention site was 5 km away from the control site and
accessible by a 2-hr boat ride most of the year, and
by foot over narrow foot paths in about 1.5 hr during
the driest months. At the time of the study, there were
no other developmental projects in these sites. At the
control site, a detailed observational study [ 171 without intervention exposed the villagers to about the
same amount of contact with researchers. The intervention was implemented in the poorer and less
hygienic of the two sites in order to increase the
probability that observed conservative results would
be attributable to intervention.
Following baseline **surveys** at the two sites in
August and September, a census was conducted in
October, 1985 in five selected villages at each site to
enlist the families with children below 19 months of
age who were targeted for intervention and for
structured observational study. This census was also
used to collect socioeconomic and demographic information of the target households. Initially, the
intervention site had 194 families comprising 98% of
all households with children under 19 months, while
the control site had 193, or 97%, of all the targeted
families. Nine deaths and eight children who left the
area subsequently reduced the sample to 185 in each
site.

_Field methods_

One Tufts doctoral candidate in nutrition and one
local Master’s degree research assistant/field supervisor lived at each site for the duration of the study
during which they trained and supervised IO field
workers at each site. These paid workers were highschool graduates from the study communities selected for their interest and ability to work in the field.
At each site, two of the workers were specially trained
for anthropometry, two for morbidity surveillance
and one for data coding. Five workers were responsible for implementing, organizing, and facilitating
the campaign activities in the intervention site, while
five others conducted structured observations in the
control site. In the intervention site, the field workers,
research assistant. and doctoral candidate became the
working group who communally discussed, tried, and
decided upon interventions.
Anthropometry began in November, 1985 and
formal morbidity surveillance in February, 1986.
Preliminary qualitative research started in November
and the community-based intervention process in


January, 1986. The campaign in the entire community began in February. The cleanliness observations
were conducted three times per household in March,
June, and July, 1986.

_The intervention_

The intervention was developed and implemented
through a campaign called “Porichchhanna Jibon”
(clean life). First, rapport was established with village
leaders, who were in a position either to facilitate or
to resist changes in their villages. Several discussions
were organized with leaders and local officials to
explain the project in order to seek full co-operation.
Lectures were then delivered to the villagers at the
weekly Friday prayer gathering at the mosque. This
occasion was chosen because the majority (83%) of
the households were Muslim. As the Islamic leaders
stress cleanliness as an essential part of their faith, the
project also emphasized cleanliness as a common goal
in order to gain wider acceptance of the clean life
campaign.
A community-based trial model described elscwhere in detail [I 51 was used to develop interventions.
In brief, first specific hygiene practices and sanitary
conditions associated with diarrhoea, as well as cultural beliefs regarding causes of diarrhoea, were
identified through a rapid assessment survey, field
observations, in-home problem diagnosis, and focus
group discussions with the community.
The project working group met to assess community resources to use in the intervention and to
generate ideas for new hygiene practices and products
for the trials. All proposed behaviours and products
were tested and revised through iterative in-home
trials at three levels: the 10 project workers; 25
volunteer mothers; and 25 of the poorest community
mothers. The project workers trained and supervised
the community volunteer mothers, who in turn
taught the rest of the mothers in the community.
New hygiene behaviours and products that proved
feasible in the project workers’ trials were then tried
by the volunteers. The results were synthesized, with
successful behavioural advice translated into simple
action messages based on locally popular proverbs.
poems, and folk songs. Final pre-testing and minor
revisions in the messages took place in the trials with
the poorest mothers during the education campaign
##### u51.

_Campaign strategy_

The intervention site was divided into five geographical blocks. For each block, five volunteer
mothers and one worker were responsible for teaching the other community mothers in their neighborhoods in groups of three to five, at least twice a week.
The small group was chosen to ensure active involvement of each mother in group activities. For the
group discussions, mothers chose their least busy
time, **usually** in the late morning or late afternoon.

ing questions and answers and discussion among the
volunteer and community mothers. In the sessions,
they learned from each others’ contributions.
The germ theory of disease was taught as a first
step, in order to develop an understanding about the
transmission of disease, as most people believed that
the origins of diarrhoea were the “evil eye”, “bad
air”, spirits, teething, or too early introduction of the
adult diet. In addition, some considered that the
child’s eating its own feces helped teeth to come
through in the teething process; only 4% of mothers
had heard about germs [15]. The mothers were encouraged to identify their problems in light of what
they learned about transmission of germs and to find
their own solutions through group participation and
discussions. The volunteers usually initiated the discussions by asking mothers to identify the biggest
health problem in the village. “Diarrhoea” was a
commmon response. The issues brought up typically
related to cleanliness and hygiene. Next, they explored possible causes and solutions to the problems
based on the mothers’ thinking and talking. Hygiene
and sanitation behaviours were actively demonstrated by the volunteers, and taken up by group
participation so as to dramatize how these behaviours
affect health. They also discussed ways to protect
people from diseases. The mothers were receptive,
and messages were presented theme by theme to be
integrated into their daily lives.
The following interventions were developed, implemented, and adopted in the community.

**_Theme I: Ground Sanitation-keeping_** **_babies from_**
**_touching and eating disease-causing matter on the dirt_**
**_surface of the compound_**

(1) Sweep the baby’s play area four times a day.
(2) Use a dirt thrower (similar to a flat garden
trowel provided by the project at US $0.30) to
immediately remove the baby’s or animal feces from
the compound surface, so that the crawling baby
could not be contaminated by feces from the ground.
(3) Construct a feces pit to dispose of feces and
other filthy matter from the compound. The feces pit
was about 2 ft deep, with a narrow neck.
(4) Wash babies in a particular place after defecation so that germ-contaminated water did not spread
everywhere.
(5) Keep crawling babies in a playpen (locally
constructed, provided by the project at a cost of US
$1 .OO) instead of permitting them to crawl in the dirt.

**_Theme II: Personal Hygiene-reducing_** **_the trans-_**
**_mission of germs from defecation and other personal_**
**_hygiene behaviours_**

(1) Wash parent’s and child’s hands with ashes or
soap after defecation as well as before and after
feeding or eating.
(2) Use the “bodna” (water pitcher used for cleaning after defecation) with the right hand only so that
the germs from the left hand (used for cleaning after


defecation) do not contaminate the bodna for the
next user.
(3) Clean the baby immediately after defecation so
that the baby could not be contaminated with his/her
feces.
(4) Use a razor blade to cut the nails of all family
members, including babies, at least once a week.
Since the custom in Bangladesh is to eat with the
hand, long nails can regularly transport germs to the
mouth.
(5) Use a clean hand rag to dry the mother’s hands
after defecation instead of using her own sari.
(6) Clean the baby rug or mat immediately
whenever it becomes soiled so that the baby would
not come into contact with dirty matter.

**_Theme III: Food Hygiene-reducing_** **_the transmission_**
**_of germs during supplementary and bottle feeding_**
**_(1)_**
Do not use any feeding bottles (small brown
medicine bottles were used) if possible.
(2) If using a bottle, soak it in strong salt water
and/or wash it in hot water and boil the nipple before
feeding.
(3) Prepare only the quantity of bottle mixture that
the baby could drink at one time. Mothers were
taught that germs would contaminate any left-over
bottle mixture.
(4) Use only tubewell water for drinking and for
mixing food for baby.
(5) Wash both caretaker’s and child’s hands and
eating plates with tubewell water before eating. Wash
both hands and utensils before food preparation.
(6) Do not feed left-over food which might be
contaminated.
(7) Keep all food covered from flies, dirt, chickens
and dogs.
(8) Store clean plates and pots and pans upside
down or covering them to keep animals off.
(9) Cover water pitchers (storage vessels) so that
animals or flies could not contaminate the drinking
water.

**_Data collection_**

Data were gathered during home visits by the two
field workers who were not involved in the intervention activities. Socioeconomic and demographic data
were obtained from the household head or other
responsible adult. The child’s age was determined by
discussion among family members based on a local
festivals and events calendar and the date(s) of birth
of the nearest sibling(s). The mother’s day-by-day
recall of illness was recorded by two morbidity
workers, who visited households weekly in serial
order from February to July. Each worker visited
each mother on alternate weeks to limit interviewer
bias.
During their weekly home visits, the morbidity
investigators administered a monitoring questionnaire with questions regarding awareness, understanding of benefits, and adoption of each message.

Anthropometric measurements were obtained
through visiting each home on approximately the

children absent during regular visits. Two field
workers were trained and their measurements standardized for all anthropometric techniques according to the Zerfas Method [18]. The child’s weight

The definition of diarrhoea was influenced by
liquid breastmilk stool [20]. At the end of the study,
more than 90% of the children were still breastfed.
During the 5 months of instrument pretesting at the
observation site [21], it was concluded that many
breastfed subjects had five or more soft or liquid
breastmilk stools per day that were nevertheless
normal, and considered normal by their mothers,
who did not seem to remember the exact frequency
of these stools.

Therefore, mothers were asked to recall the presence or absence of diarrhoea according to their own
perceptions. If diarrhoea was reported, the mother
was asked if the stool was: softer than usual. 1-5

**1985,** and ranged from 0 to 19 months. Age distributions of the children by month were similar in both
sites.
The intervention site was similar to the control site
in the following variables: mother’s age, father’s age,
radio ownership, source of drinking water, and distance between the latrine and the children’s play area.
The intervention site, however, had more Muslims
(83% vs 57%) and fewer mothers who had attended
school (13% vs 25%). In the intervention site, only
one mother had completed 10 years of education
compared to ten mothers in the control site. The
father’s education was also lower in the intervention
site (31% vs 49% school attendance). About half as
many intervention as control fathers had 10 or more
years of education. The intervention site had a larger
percentage of households owning land and animals
and employed in agriculture and fishing. The control
site had more salaried jobs, traders and craftsmen,
and better housing with fewer persons per room.
Though the control site was also very rural, it bor

dered on the upazilla (subdistrict) center, where there
were small offices, an open market, schools, a rural
health center and a 3-bed hospital.

The intervention began in the community in February and continued through to July. The measures
taken in February are considered initial and those
taken in July are final measures.

indicators in the intervention site differed dramatically from the control site. Cleanliness of children’s
faces and the play areas increased in both the sites;
however, far greater increases were observed in the
intervention site compared to the control site.

**_Diarrhoeal morbidity_**

Figures 3 and 4 depict the comparative prevalence
of any diarrhoea and of severe diarrhoea per day over
the 6-month period in the intervention and control
sites. In February, both types of diarrhoea were more
prevalent in the intervention site, but from March to
June the prevalence in the intervention site was
consistently lower than that of the control site. In the
final month, the difference between the sites in diarrhoeal rates disappeared. The overall patterns of
diarrhoeal morbidity were similar in both sites, with
peaks in April and May, which are the hottest months
of the year.

**_Growth status_**

In February the percentage of children in the
normal growth category with WAZ above - 2SD was
53% in the intervention site and 58% in the control
site. While the percentage of normal children did not
differ significantly, Fig. 5 illustrates that the percentages of severely malnourished children (below - 3SD
WAZ) were reduced over time in the intervention site
compared to the control site. These rates were higher
in the intervention group from November to March;
in April, both sites had about the same rates. From
May to July, these percentages were significantly
lower in the intervention site.
An analysis of same data shows that a sharp
decrease from 40 to 5% in the rate of bottle feeding
in the intervention site from the beginning to the
middle of the study. This is consistent with the finding
that height-for-age Z scores were lower in the intervention children compared to the control children,
with differences that increased over time. In contrast,
weight-for-height Z scores were higher for the intervention children compared with the control site children, with a similar trend of increasing differences
between the two sites.

**_Within -intervention site analysis_**

The adoption rates of the intervention varied from
85 to 98% for different themes. The mother’s edu

cation was correlated with her understanding score
**_(r =_** 0.18; P = O.OOS), cleanliness score **_(r =_** 0.31;
P = O.OOOl), child’s WAZ **_(r =_** 0.29; P = O.OOOl), and
marginally with her overall adoption score **_(r =_** 0.10;
P = **_0.09)._** The child’s age correlated negatively with
both food hygiene score **_(r = -0.20;_** **_P = 0.004)_** and
overall adoption score **_(r = -0.12;_** **_P = 0.05)._** As
shown in Table 3 the mother’s understanding score
was significantly associated with all outcome variables. Food hygiene and overall adoption scores were
correlated negatively with diarrhoea and positively
with cleanliness and the weight-for-age Z-score. The
data also confirm expected associations among cleanliness, diarrhoea and WAZ scores.

**DISCUSSION**

A blind or double blind and randomized intervention trial was beyond the scope of this study. Therefore, we took other measures to minimize selection,
interviewer, and respondent biases. Intervention research that mobilized the community to participate in
problem solving, message/product design and implementation and intervention was too intensive to
conduct simultaneously in a statistical sample of
randomly selected communities. The best we were
able to achieve was an N of two comparable communities. As noted in the Methods section, we selected
the less developed and more environmentally contaminated community for intervention, to increase
the probability that measurable differences after the
program would be attributable to the intervention
rather than to site differences.
The intervention could not be blinded from its
participants, although the purpose of the observational hygiene study at the control site was concealed.
Moreover, it was not possible to randomly assign
study subjects at the same community to intervention
vs non-intervention groups due to the highly contaminative nature of our community mobilization campaign.
In order to minimize interviewer/observer bias, we
did not involve the personnel who were implementing
the intervention in data collection. All project
workers, including the data collectors, took an oath
which had a strong religious value, to perform their
duties exactly as instructed. The penalty for breaking

##### conditions were assessed by observation rather than self report. No incentive was provided to the mothers for reporting or showing better hygiene practices or absence of diarrhoea, and no medicine or other treatment was given for reporting diarrhoea. To gather reasonably accurate information, we began training the two field workers who collected morbidity and hygiene information 3 months before the intervention. As they practiced gathering weekly information over the 3 months, the data recording procedures were refined and standardized and the respondents become experienced in recalling and providing information. To help mothers to recall dates, for example, we used weekly local market days and Friday, the weekly prayer gathering day, as landmarks. We did not use this first 3 months of data. In the absence of an intervention there would have been little or no motivation to bias the data during this learning period. It was expected that the report- ing habits acquired during this time would have continued for the duration of the study. In view of these procedures and our close attention to data quality control, we believe it is unlikely that the data suffer from serious biases or inaccuracies. The intervention and control communities were similar in many crucial aspects including source of drinking water, latrine condition and location, child care and cultural practices, wealth as measured by household possessions, and demographics (age, sex, mother’s and father’s age). Both were located in low-lying area and exposed to similar sources of environmental contamination. Yet the intervention site was somewhat more rural and agricultural and the control site more exposed to modernizing influences. A quarter of the control vs half of the intervention households owned agricul- tural land while 22% of the controls vs 11% of the intervention fathers had salaried jobs. Although few mothers had attended school in either sample; the difference in proportions and in average years of schooling for both mothers and fathers were statisti- cally significant. As found in other studies [17,23,24], these pre-existing differences favoured the health of the children in the control site. The more agricultural intervention site families owned more animals and had more animal feces littering the children’s play areas. The presence of feces in the play area was associated with higher prevalence of diarrhoea. Ma- ternal education was associated with better cleanli- ness and growth status. These disparities, therefore worked against the intervention rather than giving unattributable impact to it. The results of this study suggest that community- based intervention can improve hygiene knowledge, modify relevant practices, lower diarrhoeal disease, and reduce malnutrition even in an impoverished setting with many undesirable cultural beliefs that interfere with child health. We will first focus on ways in which the interven- tion enabled its participants to gain some control


##### over their environment, then on its interactions with environmental and climatic constraints. The occur- rence of diarrhoea was believed to be primarily supernatural and beyond human control before the intervention [ 151. The intervention provided some scientific understanding of disease by teaching germ theory and increasing mother’s awareness of the danger of feces contamination. The intervention also empowered the mothers to take control over some aspects of their health. The supportive group discussions, in which mothers shared their experiences, possibly con- tributed to their self-confidence and self-esteem. This process encouraged mothers to identify their prob- lems and to understand the benefits derived from the interventions. Their better understanding appeared to inspire them to adopt these interventions at high rates into their daily lives and practice hygienic behaviours 1151.
 The project’s products and messages made it more convenient for families to practice cleanliness and sanitation behaviours. For example, it was observed that once provided with a dirt thrower, other family members became more willing to clean feces, while previously it had been only the mother’s task. This enthusiastic response was due to the fact that this product allowed users to keep their hands clean and to remove feces completely from the ground [25]. As expected, the higher adoption of the interventions was associated with a higher score in overall cleanli- ness behaviours. These in turn may have contributed to reduced diarrhoeal transmissions and improved WAZ. While the intervention appeared to be effective in mitigating the effects of seasonal temperature changes, it was not adequate to cope with flooding. The effect of extreme seasonal variations in tempera- ture and water level also were beyond the control of the intervention. In the hottest months, April-May, the high rates of diarrhoea were probably related to the use of contaminated water for cleaning, washing and food preparation. Although during these months rapid proliferation of microorganisms in foods and water was associated with the diarrhoea epidemic documented by Black in another study [26] in rural Bangladesh, the intervention site had substantially lower rates of diarrhoea than the rates at the control site. Consistent use of tubewell water for drinking, children’s food preparation, and washing hands be- fore meals in the intervention site may have con- tributed to this difference. Floods are a major threat to life in Bangladesh. During flooding the quality of water is poor. The intervention recommended depositing all feces in a pit at the edge of courtyard. July floods carried this collection of feces in bulk and contaminated the source of bathing, washing and cooking water of low lying homes. In this month, a substantially higher diarrhoeal rate was observed among the children of households with flooded feces pits, possibly because

feces-pit overflow made it worse [25]. In contrast, in
the control site, where feces were thrown into a field
or near the homestead and allowed to dry in the sun,
there was no immediate source of heavy contamination in the homestead. In the future, it could be
recommended that feces in the pit be buried with
sand, ash or soil in layers every few days and then
completely sealed over with enough soil, followed by
constructing a new pit for further use.
During flooding, with contaminated water it may
be suggested that tubewell water be used for washing
and cooking purposes, although villagers resisted the
use of tubewell water in cooking trials due to its
strong iron flavor and tendency to discolor and spoil
foods [ 151. Further trials over a longer time could test
storing the tubewell water before use so as to lower
its iron flavor by sedimentation. The traditional use
of alum, now proven to be effective to reduce bacteria
loads [27], could be reintroduced for water purification of river/pond water.
The intervention positively affected children’s
health in several ways. While child diarrhoeal rates
dropped rapidly in the intervention site, there appeared to be no significant impact on weight-for-age
in the first few months. Initial growth status of the
intervention children was lower, which had a negative
effect on their growth status in the following months
compared to the control site children. However, the
malnutrition (WAZ, WHZ) rate at the intervention
site was eventually lower than that at the control site.
Like other studies [4,28] which have shown diarrhoea
to have an adverse effect on weight gain, our data
suggest that the lower diarrhoeal prevalence in the
intervention site decreased the malnutrition rates
there.
As hypothesized, the effects of the intervention on
child weight gain were mediated through reduced
diarrhoea and improved food hygiene behaviours.
Food hygiene behaviours, including avoiding
overnight storage of cooked food which is usually
contaminated under high environmental temperature

[29] and using tubewell water for children’s food, may
have improved the absorption and utilization of food
since a reduction in diarrhoea reduces catabolism and
improves intestinal absorption [28]. Further growth
improvement could be achieved by including improved diets in the hygiene interventions.
In the intervention site, the mother’s understanding
of germ theory and the workers’ strong discouragement of bottle feeding possibly resulted in a sharp
decline in the rate of bottle feeding. Although the
reduction in bottle feeding presumably decreased
diarrhoea, milk consumption among the children
may have been reduced. This could account for the
increasing difference in HAZ between the intervention and control site over time. An analysis of the
control site data [30] showed that bottle feeding was
strongly positively related to HAZ but had no association with WAZ. Improvement in WHZ in the


intervention site may have been caused by increased
weight with relatively delayed linear growth.
In designing food hygiene interventions, one
should be careful about negative effects of any kind
of food withdrawal or reduction in impoverished
settings where a small incremental amount of food
may make a relatively large contribution to child
growth.

CONCLUSION

We believe the key factors that contributed to the
effectiveness of the intervention were as follows:
(I) Obtaining a relatively comprehensive understanding of local norms and cultural beliefs during
the early stages of intervention planning.
(2) Developing the interventions by a relatively
long-term working group made up primarily of members of the target group and their opinion leaders in
every phase of the process.
(3) Developing hygiene practices from within the
community through iterative trials led by the working
group in order to ensure their acceptance and high
adoption rates.
(4) Developing simple, direct and specific messages
resembling locally popular proverbs, poems and folk
songs to make the messages memorable, motivating
and effective.
(5) Teaching the germ theory through interactive
small group discussions led by working group members in a manner that empowered mothers to identify
their problems and to find their own solutions, and
inspired them to action in a group of similar people.
It is often recommended that educational interventions should focus on small number of behaviours, to
do so, however, may run counter to the process of
community empowerment. This project attempted to
provide the community with decision making skills.
On the basis of their understanding of disease transmission, project participants identified their many
hygiene problems, the conditions and practices responsible for these problems. They naturally sought
a sense of closure in breaking the chain of diarrhoeal
transmission. Our forcing them to focus on a small
number of behaviours would have detracted from
their completion of this task.
