EARLY 2 MILLION CHILDREN
die annually from diarrheal
disease.[1] A recent metaanalysis concluded that
handwashing promotion interven-N
tions decrease diarrhea by a mean of
47%.[2] The authors estimate that such
interventions could prevent 1 million
child deaths per year.[2] However, the systematic meta-analysis and the studies
it included summarized the reduction
in diarrheal rates among all children or
all family members. But all family members are not at equal risk of death from
diarrhea. Children younger than 5 years
are at much higher risk of death from
diarrheathanolderchildrenandadults,[1]
and infants (younger than 1 year) are
at the highest risk of death. Verbal autopsy studies from Egypt,[3] Pakistan,[4]
Bangladesh,[5] and Ethiopia[6] report that
43% to 78% of deaths from diarrhea
among children younger than 5 years
occur in the first year of life.
Infants cannot wash their own hands
and therefore cannot interrupt the
transfer of pathogens between their
hands and their mouth. Infants might
benefit from a lower rate of diarrheal
pathogen transmission from parents
and siblings who wash their hands more


**Context Washing hands with soap prevents diarrhea, but children at the highest risk**
of death from diarrhea are younger than 1 year, too young to wash their own hands.
Previous studies lacked sufficient power to assess the impact of household handwashing on diarrhea in infants.

**Objective To evaluate the effect of promoting household handwashing with soap**
among children at the highest risk of death from diarrhea.

**Design, Setting, and Participants A cluster randomized controlled trial of 36 low-**
income neighborhoods in urban squatter settlements in Karachi, Pakistan. Field workers visited participating households at least weekly from April 15, 2002, to April 5,
2003. Eligible households located in the study area had at least 2 children younger
than 15 years, at least 1 of whom was younger than 5 years.

**Interventions Weekly visits in 25 neighborhoods to promote handwashing with soap**
after defecation and before preparing food, eating, and feeding a child. Within intervention neighborhoods, 300 households (1523 children) received a regular supply of
antibacterial soap and 300 households (1640 children) received plain soap. Eleven neighborhoods (306 households and 1528 children) comprised the control group.

**Main Outcome Measure Incidence density of diarrhea among children, defined**
as the number of diarrheal episodes per 100 person-weeks of observation.

**Results Children younger than 15 years living in households that received hand-**
washing promotion and plain soap had a 53% lower incidence of diarrhea (95% confidence interval [CI], –65% to –41%) compared with children living in control neighborhoods. Infants living in households that received handwashing promotion and plain
soap had 39% fewer days with diarrhea (95% CI, –61% to –16%) vs infants living in
control neighborhoods. Severely malnourished children (weight for age z score, �–3.0)
younger than 5 years living in households that received handwashing promotion and
plain soap had 42% fewer days with diarrhea (95% CI, –69% to –16%) vs severely
malnourished children in the control group. Similar reductions in diarrhea were observed among children living in households receiving antibacterial soap.

**Conclusion In a setting in which diarrhea is a leading cause of child death, improve-**
ment in handwashing in the household reduced the incidence of diarrhea among children at high risk of death from diarrhea.

borhoods comprising 600 handwashing
promotion households and 306 control households were assigned. Ultimately, 25 neighborhoods were assigned to handwashing promotion and
11 to control (FIGURE 1). Handwashingpromotionwasassignedattheneighborhood level because a number of the
handwashing promotion activities were
neighborhood-level activities. Antibacterial vs plain soap was randomly assigned at the household level.

**Interventions**
**Handwashing Promotion. Field work-**
ers conducted neighborhood meetings
about handwashing. They used slide
shows, videotapes, and pamphlets to illustrate health problems resulting from
contaminated hands and to provide specifichandwashinginstructions.Thecore
handwashing promotion activity was
regular, at least weekly, household visits by the field workers. Each field
worker spoke the first language of the
study households they visited. They describedindetailtheimportanceofhandwashing. They encouraged participants to wet their hands, lather them
completely with soap, and rub them together for 45 seconds. Hands were typically dried on the participants’ clothing. Field workers encouraged all
persons in intervention households old
enough to understand (generally those
participants older than 30 months) to
wash their hands after defecation and
cleaning an infant who had defecated,
and before preparing food, eating, and
feeding infants. They encouraged adopting regular handwashing habits. Field
workers also encouraged participants to
bathe once a day with soap and water.
Fieldworkersencouragedquestionsand
discussionabouthandwashing.Theyresupplied the families with soap as
needed. Field workers did not provide
educational messages on water treatment, food hygiene, or other strategies
to decrease diarrhea.
**Soap. The antibacterial soap con-**
tained 1.2% triclocarban as an antibacterial agent. The plain soap was identical to the antibacterial soap with the
single exception that it did not contain


frequently with soap but the benefit to
the infant might be quite different from
the overall benefit.
We identified only 2 handwashing intervention trials from developing countries that reported diarrheal rates among
infants.[7,8] In 1 study in which the intervention assignment was randomized,[7]
theanalysisaccountedfortheclusterdesign but the measured 24% reduction in
diarrheal disease among children
younger than 1 year was not significantly different from the control group.
A second handwashing promotion
study[8] reported a 61% reduction in diarrheal disease among children younger
than 1 year but there was only 1 intervention handwashing promotion community and 1 control community. The
datawereanalyzedattheindividuallevel
and the repeated measures of each individual were not accounted for in the
analysis.[8]
In addition to young age, malnutrition[9-11] and persistent diarrhea[10,12,13] are
important risk factors for death from diarrhea. We cannot identify any handwashing intervention trials that evaluated effectiveness among malnourished
childrenorforpersistentdiarrhea.Thus,
the effectiveness of handwashing with
soap in preventing diarrhea among the
most vulnerable children is unclear.
InKarachi,Pakistan,morethan4million low-income residents live in squatter settlements where they do not own
legal title to the land and municipal infrastructure is limited.[14] A verbal autopsy study from these communities
concluded that 41% of all childhood
deaths younger than 5 years were due
to diarrhea.[15] Seventy-three percent of
these diarrheal deaths occurred among
infants.[15] We evaluated whether promoting washing hands with soap decreased diarrhea among children at the
highest risk of death from diarrhea in
Karachi squatter settlements.

**METHODS**
**Setting**
TheKarachiSoapHealthStudywasconducted in adjoining multiethnic squatter settlements in central Karachi—
Bilal, Hazara, Manzoor, and Mujahid


colonies—in collaboration with Health
OrientedPreventiveEducation(HOPE),
anongovernmentalorganizationthatoperates local health clinics and supports
community-based health and development initiatives.
Most residents in these communities have household toilets but the dischargeflowsintoopensewers.Afterdefecation, toilet paper is rarely used.
Instead, residents routinely rinse their
anus with water from a pitcher. Although handwashing, typically with water alone, is part of ritual preparation for
prayer in these communities, thorough
washing of hands with soap is less common, even though affordable hand soap
is widely available throughout these
communities from small neighborhood shops. The water used for drinking and handwashing in these communities is heavily contaminated with fecal
organisms.[16] Hands are typically dried
on clothing. Clothing is usually laundered after several days of wear.

**Study Groups**
Field workers identified 42 candidate
neighborhoods of 60 to 273 households, separated from one another by a
streetormarketarea.Fieldworkersconducted a census of these neighborhoods, and before intervention assignment, identified and obtained informed
consent from 1050 households. Eligible households were located in the
study area, had at least 2 children
younger than 15 years, at least 1 of
whom was younger than 5 years, and
planned to continue to reside in their
homes for the duration of the study.
The field workers listed the candidate neighborhoods in order of proximity to their field center. One of the investigators not involved in recruiting
neighborhoods or households (S.P.L.)
programmed a spreadsheet to generate
randomly the integers 1 or 2 with twice
the probability of generating a 2 vs a 1.

neighborhoods with a 1 were assigned

triclocarban. Both soaps were provided
as 90-g white bars without a brand name
or symbol and packaged identically in
agenericwhitewrapper.Casesof96bars
were identified by serial numbers that
were matched to households. Neither
the field workers nor the families knew
whether the family’s soap was antibacterial or plain.
**Control. Field workers provided con-**
trol households with a regular supply of
children’s books, notebooks, pens, and
pencils to help with their children’s educationbutnoproductsthatwouldbeexpected to affect diarrhea. Field workers
neither encouraged nor discouraged
handwashing in control households.
Field workers visited control and intervention households with equal frequency to collect health outcome data
but the visits were shorter in control
households because no health education or encouragement for behavior
change was provided.

**Field Workers**
Field workers recruited from the study
or nearby communities were extensively trained in interviewing techniques, data recording, approaches to
promote handwashing, and measuring
and weighing children. The same field
workers promoted handwashing and
collected outcome data during their
household visits.

**Measurements**
Trained field workers conducted a preintervention baseline survey of householdcharacteristics.Theyidentifiedeach
child (aged �15 years) in the household. Children’s dates of birth were confirmed with birth certificates or immunization records. Field workers visited
participating households at least weekly
for 1 year (April 15, 2002, to April 5,
2003) and asked the mother or other
caregiver if the children had diarrhea
(�3 loose stools within 24 hours) in the
precedingweek,and,ifso,forhowmany
days. Typically, field workers visited
each household twice during the week
to ensure that episodes of diarrhea from
both early and late in the week were recalled. Supervisors revisited 40% of

recordedbythefieldworkerand,ifthere
was a discrepancy, the fieldworker and
supervisor revisited the house to clarify
the difference.
Field workers weighed participating
children younger than 5 years at baseline and every 4 months. Field workers
weighed children 3 years or younger by
using a hanging scale (Salter, Tonbridge, Kent, England) and children
older than 3 years by using a bathroom
scale. We calculated weight for age z
scores to compare the study children’s
weight with the National Center for
Health Statistics standards. The z score
represents the number of standard deviationsthatthechild’smeasuredweight
for age differs from the standard healthy
population. We calculated the mean
weight for age z score from the multiple weighing sessions throughout the
study for each child. We classified childrenasmoderatelymalnourishediftheir


meanweightforage _z_ scorewaslessthan
–2.0 and −3.0 or higher, and severely
malnourished if their mean weight for
age z score was less than –3.0.

**Statistics**
A primary hypothesis of the Karachi
Soap Health Study was that promoting
handwashing with antibacterial or plain
soap would significantly reduce the
amount of diarrheal illness compared
with standard habits and practices in the
control group. (Other primary hypotheses of the Karachi Soap Health Study
address the effectiveness of bathing and
handwashing with antibacterial or plain
soap in preventing impetigo and acute
respiratory illness and will be reported
separately.) A primary study outcome
wastheincidencedensityofdiarrhea(ie,
the number of new episodes of diarrhea divided by the at-risk personweeks of observation). We considered
a child at risk for a new episode of diarrhea if he or she reported no diarrhea
in the previous week. We also measured disease outcome using longitudi

analysis). We considered P�.05 as statistically significant. We used SAS version 9.0 and JMP version 5.0 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) to conduct the
statistical analysis.

**Ethics**
Community leaders and heads of households provided informed consent. Ill
children were assessed by field workers and referred to the appropriate level
of health care. The first line of treatment for diarrhea was oral rehydration
solution. Ill children referred by field
workers were offered clinical services
free of charge at HOPE health care facilities located in these communities.
The study protocol was approved by the
ethicsreviewcommitteeoftheAgaKhan
University and an institutional review
board of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**RESULTS**
The 36 neighborhoods in the study included a median 115 households
(range, 60-273 households). A median of 21% of households in each
neighborhood (range, 6%-39%) met the
eligibility criteria for the study. All eligible households chose to enroll. Thus,
for the study, a median 26 households
participated per neighborhood (range,
9-37; interquartile range, 21-30).
Within the 25 neighborhoods randomized to handwashing promotion, 300
households (1523 children) were randomized to receive antibacterial soap
and 300 households (1640 children)
were randomized to receive plain soap
(Figure 1). Eleven neighborhoods, representing 306 households and 1528
children, were randomized to the standard habits and practices control group.


nal prevalence because it is more closely
associated with growth faltering and
child mortality than is diarrhea incidence.[17] We calculated longitudinal
prevalence by summing the number of
days each child had diarrhea and dividing by the total number of days of observation.
We calculated a sample size of 239
households per intervention group, assuming 1.2 episodes of diarrhea per 100
person-weeks among children younger
than 15 years in the control group, 25%
lower incidence of diarrhea in each
handwashing promotion group vs control, 3.8 children per household, and
a doubling of sample size to offset the
effect of clustering by neighborhood
and repeated measures. We increased
the sample size to 300 households per
intervention group to assess other
health outcomes, which will be reported separately.


Because we assigned soap promotionvscontrolattheneighborhoodlevel,
we analyzed the comparison of outcomes at the neighborhood level. Specifically, within each neighborhood
among person-weeks within the subgroup of interest, we identified the total
number of new episodes of diarrhea or
days of diarrhea and divided it by the
total number of person-weeks at risk for

During 51 weeks of follow-up, diarrhea outcome information was collected on 210133 person-weeks, representing 89% of the study populations’
experience (88% in antibacterial soap,
89% in plain soap, and 89% in control
households). The most common reason for failure to collect information
was that study participants had temporarily left the city to visit relatives.
There was a discrepancy between the
field worker’s record of diarrhea symptoms and the supervisor’s record in less
than 1% of supervisory visits.
At baseline, households in the 3 interventiongroupswereofsimilarsizeand
socioeconomic status, had a comparable number of young children, a similar proportion of whom were malnourished, similar sources of water, sanitary
facilities, and reported hand soap purchases (TABLE 1). Mothers reported

During the course of the study, handwashing promotion households received a mean 3.3 bars of the study soap
per week; this translates into each
household resident using a mean 4.4 g/d
of soap.
Compared with children living in
control neighborhoods, children living in households that received plain
soap and encouragement to wash their
hands had a 53% lower incidence of diarrhea (95% CI, –65% to –41%) and a
50% lower longitudinal prevalence of

ing antibacterial soap vs households
receiving plain soap (TABLE 5).
Seven children died during the study.
For 3 of the children, 1 from each of the
study groups, the mother reported that
the child had diarrhea as part of the illness that led to his/her death. These
deaths occurred in children aged 33, 36,
and 63 months. The diarrhea-specific
death rate was 1.6 deaths per 1000 children younger than 5 years per year.

**COMMENT**
In these communities in which diarrhea is the leading cause of childhood
death, wash water was heavily contaminated with human fecal organisms, and
no provisions were made for clean drying of hands, handwashing promotion
with soap halved the burden of diarrheal disease. This study addressed
many of the methodological concerns
raised by previous reviewers of hygiene interventions.[2,20] The intervention was randomly assigned and included a contemporaneous control
group. Diarrhea prevalence was similar at the beginning of the study between intervention and control groups.
The analysis accounted for the cluster
design of the intervention and had sufficient power to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in subgroups
of children at the highest risk of death
from diarrhea. The overall level of reduction in longitudinal prevalence of
diarrhea among children in households with handwashing promotion
(50% in the plain soap and 46% in the
antibacterial soap groups) was remarkably close to the 47% decrease calculated in the recent meta-analysis on the
effect of handwashing in preventing
diarrhea.[2]
Our study was not designed to evaluate child mortality as an outcome. Only
3 children died from diarrhea during the
study, 1 from each group. Our rate of
deathfromdiarrheawas79%lowerthan
the diarrhea-specific death rate for children younger than 5 years previously reported from similar communities.[15] The
close surveillance for childhood illness
by field workers and rapid referral to appropriate clinical care at no cost to the


rable age and nutrition status living in
control neighborhoods (TABLE 4). The
malnutrition-specificlongitudinalprevalence of diarrhea among households receiving antibacterial soap was similar to
households receiving plain soap.
Compared with control neighborhoods, children living in households
that received plain soap and handwashing promotion were 56% less
likely to visit a health care practitioner
for diarrhea (95% CI, –69% to –43%).
Hospitalization for diarrhea was
uncommon, occurring in only 0.23%
of the observed person-weeks. Children living in households receiving
plain soap and handwashing promo

tion were 26% less likely to be hospitalized for diarrhea but this difference
was not statistically significant (95%
CI, –100% to 66%). Only 5% of
observed episodes of diarrhea were
persistent diarrhea (ie, episodes lasting
�14 days). Children living in households receiving plain soap and handwashing promotion were 31% less
likely to have a persistent episode of
diarrhea but this difference was not
statistically significant (95% CI, –70%
to 8%). The probability of visiting a
health care practitioner for diarrhea,
being hospitalized for diarrhea, and
having a persistent episode of diarrhea
was similar among households receiv

EFFECT OF INTENSIVE HANDWASHING ON CHILDHOOD DIARRHEA

study. First, study personnel and participants were not blinded to the intervention. It is possible that study participants in the handwashing promotion
groups, grateful for the soap, minimized reported episodes of diarrhea in

family likely contributed to this low
death rate.
However, our study did have sufficient power to evaluate the effectiveness of handwashing promotion with
soap among children at high risk for
death from diarrhea. Important risk factors for diarrhea-specific death in developing countries include age younger
than1year,[3-6,15] malnutrition,[9-11] andpersistent diarrhea.[10,12,13] In our study, infants who were unable to wash their
hands had 39% fewer days of diarrhea
if they lived in households that received plain soap and encouragement to
wash hands compared with control
households. This 39% reduction in diarrhea for infants was less than the 57%
reductionobservedamongchildrenaged
between 5 and 15 years who are able to
regularly wash their own hands.
Handwashing with soap removes
transient potentially pathogenic organisms from hands.[21,22] If individuals wash
their hands, they are less likely to transmit pathogens from their hands to their
mouths. This mechanism benefits the
person washing his/her hands and is not
available to infants. However, persons
washing their hands are also less likely
to transfer pathogens from their hands
to the hands of others, or to food or the
environment that is shared with others. Moreover, parents and siblings who
prevent their own episodes of diarrhea are less likely to shed pathogens
to the vulnerable infant’s environment. Our study findings suggest that
household handwashing interrupts
transmission of diarrheal pathogens sufficiently to markedly reduce diarrhea
among infants.
Moderately or severely malnourished children had as large a reduction
in diarrhea from improvement in household handwashing as children without
malnutrition. Although some reduction in persistent diarrhea (19%-31%)
was observed within households receiving soap and handwashing promotion,
persistent diarrhea was uncommon and
these reductions were not statistically
significant. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of handwashing with soap in reducingthelongitudinalprevalenceofdi

arrhea among children at increased risk
ofdeathfromdiarrhea—infantsandmalnourishedchildren—suggeststhathandwashingwithsoapwouldreducetherisk
of death from diarrhea.
We found no significant difference
in diarrheal disease among persons living in households receiving antibacterialsoapcomparedwithplainsoap.This
is not surprising because triclocarban
is a bacteriostatic agent that inhibits the
growth of some gram-positive bacteria but is not effective against gramnegative bacteria, viruses, or parasites
that cause infectious diarrhea.[23,24]

Asecondlimitationwasthatourstudy
was not originally undertaken to evaluate the hypothesis that children at the
highest risk of death would benefit from
handwashing. We observed more diarrheathanweexpected.Diarrheawasunusually prevalent in Karachi in the summer of 2002, both as measured within
the study as well as by reports from local clinicians. The incidence of diarrhea in the control group was more than
3timeshigherthanincontrolgroupswe
had observed in earlier studies in 2000
and 2001, which we used to estimate the
sample size. We further increased the
sample size to assess other outcomes.
Thus, sufficient observations for the
analysis of diarrhea among subgroups at
high risk of death were recorded. The
analysisandreportingofinterestingsubgroups risks publication bias. However, the reduction in diarrheal disease
noted among infants and malnourished children was not statistically
borderline. Moreover, there were 2 intervention groups, plain soap and antibacterial soap, and the findings from
both suggest a consistent phenomena.
A third limitation was that all of the

utable to improved handwashing. It is
possible that regular visits by field workers, the provision of soap, and the successfulimprovementinhandhygieneled
to other behavioral changes in households that reduced diarrheal disease.
However, the high soap consumption of
families suggests frequent handwashing and field workers were specifically
trained to limit behavioral change messages to handwashing promotion. Thus,
improved handwashing likely played an
important role in reducing the incidence of diarrhea.
Although visiting households weekly
to provide free soap and encourage
handwashing was effective in reducing diarrhea, this approach is prohibitively expensive for widespread implementation. The next essential step is to
develop effective approaches to promote handwashing that cost less and
can be used to reach millions of atrisk households. Studies evaluating the
durability of behavioral change from
handwashing promotion are also important to assess cost-effectiveness. In
the interim, existing public health programs should experiment with integrating handwashing promotion into
their current activities.
