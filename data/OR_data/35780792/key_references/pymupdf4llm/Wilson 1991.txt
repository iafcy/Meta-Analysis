# Hand-washing reduces diarrhoea episodes: a study in Lombok, Indonesia


Project, Swaramahardika 16, Mataram, Lombok, NTB, Indonesia


Sixty-five mothers from Balai Lua, Central Lombok, Indonesia were given soap and an explanation of
the faecal-oral route of diarrhoea transmission. This
very simple health message was repeated and reinforced fortnightly when mothers were also asked
whether any members of their family had suffered
from diarrhoea over the previous 2 weeks. Children of
these mothers experienced an 89% reduction in
diarrhoea episodes compared to a control period
before the intervention.

Introduction
Many million children die of diarrhoea each year.
Many more are chronically debilitated and become
malnourished as a result of frequent episodes of
diarrhoea which leave them susceptible to other
infectious diseases. Much worthwhile effort has gone
into promotion of diarrhoea treatment with oral
rehydration salts but the interventions required to
prevent diarrhoea are less well understood. Handwashing breaks the cycle of diarrhoea acquisition
(KHAN, 1982; FEACHEM, 1984). There have, however, been few community-based investigations of the
effect on diarrhoea control of encouraging handwashing through health education uroarammes.
In r&al Bangladesh, improved water-supply combined with hygiene education reduced diarrhoea
incidence bv more than 40% (ALAM et al.. 1989).
while in urban Burma hygiene education alone was as
effective in reducing episodes of diarrhoea (but not
dysentery) in the absence of better water and sanitary
facilities (AUNG MYO HAN & THEIN HLAING, 1989).
Promoting hand-washing with soap after defaecation and before contact with food seems to be the
simplest, fastest and most cost-effective method of
reducing the major cause of childhood death and adult
morbidity in an underprivileged society. This paper
reports a very limited pilot study in Lombok,
Indonesia. The work suffers from some methodological deficiencies (see BLUM & FEACHEM, 1983), but
appears to have been effective in reducing diarrhoea
nevertheless.

Study area
Central Lombok has the highest infant mortality
rate in Indonesia: the 1985 SUPAS (Sensus Penduduk
Antar Sensus) supplementary census estimated the
rate as 120 per 1000 live births. Most deaths were due
to diarrhoea but little is known about its aetiology
locally. The Sasak people of this region have poor
expectations of health and survival. Since 1945 there
have been 8 major famines in south Central Lombok

(JUDD, 1980) and innumerable deaths at these times
have attracted foreign aid to the island.
The study was conducted as part of a rural water
supply and sanitation project. Two of the seven dusun
(village administrative units) within the desa (small
town) of Darek in Central Lombok were selected for
the study: Tanggung Luak and Balai Lua Daya.
These dusun were in the same neighbourhood but
were not contiguous. Housing types were similar in
both dusun but varied accordmg to the resources of
the familv. The richest households had tiled roofs.
brick walls and concrete floors while the poorest
homes were built with thatched roofs, woven bamboo
walls and mud floors.
Darek had piped drinking water available for about
3 years before the study. For washing, villagers used
small unprotected brackish wells close to their houses
or, when these were dry, one of 3 communal bathing
places each served by a deep protected well. There
was a good tarmac road to Darek, a weekly market, a
government health centre (PusKesMas) and several
schools. Most people worked in the rice fields but
there was also some paid employment, for example as
cidomo drivers (communal horse cart taxis), in small
shops or as government employees.

Methods

All women in Balai Lua Daya with a live child
under the age of 11 years were approached and an
interview requested. A small proportion (2%) were
out of the village because of trading commitments and
2 other women were too shy to be interviewed. Thus,
65 women were asked details of all children alive or
dead; enquiries were also made about the mothers’
knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to
hygiene, breastfeeding, weaning, and also about any
episodes of illness in the family over the previous two
weeks. The same questions were asked of 65 mothers
in Tanggung Luak.
After 2 weeks all 130 mothers were asked about any
episodes of illness in the family since the last interview
and how long these had lasted. This fortnightly
disease review was repeated over the next 20 weeks.
Diarrhoea episodes (maceret or diare) were defined as
loose stools for more than 24 h. Since most women
were illiterate they were unable to record disease
episodes on calendars and it is possible that some
disease episodes were overlooked. Certainly multiple
disease episodes within one reporting period for the
same child were exceptional.
Eight weeks after the start of the study, meetings
were held amonast the 65 mothers in Balai Lua, the
village selected lfor the hand-washing intervention.
The women were told that diarrhoea comes from
faeces getting into the mouth by way of dirty hands,
contaminated food, and flies which have first landed

on faeces. To prevent diarrhoea it was suggested that
the mothers should therefore (i) wash their hands with
soap before preparing food; (ii) wash their hands with
soap before eating; (iii) wash their childrens’ hands
with soap before they eat; and (iv) wash their hands
with soap as soon as possible after defaecation. Each
woman was given a plastic soap dish and a bar of
‘OK’@ soap (the brand most readily available in the
villages, costing Rp 50, equivalent to 2 UK pence).
The fortnightly disease reviews continued and were
used to reinforce the hygiene messages, to talk about
any health issues, and to replenish the soap as
necessary.
Fortnightly disease reviews also continued in Tanggung Luak (the control village). Here the women
were not given soap, and information about diarrhoea
acquisition was given only in response to specific
questions. However, mothers were told about oral
rehydration therapy and encouraged to use this to
treat any childhood diarrhoea.

Results

The survey covered 130 mothers and 315 children.
The villages were similar in most indices, attitudes
and hygiene practices. Many women (23%) associated
dirt or poor sanitation with diarrhoea transmission
and 25% thought that diarrhoea came from eating bad
food. A few (2%) thought that measles was caused by
poor sanitation. Maternal educational levels in the 2
villages differed somewhat (Table l), but most
women were illiterate. Childhood deaths over the
previous 10 years had all been of those aged 3 years or
less; child mortality rates were declining but were still
about 28%. Breastfeeding was almost universal; only
3 children of 446 live births had been given formula
milk from a bottle before the age of 3 months.
However, solid food (mashed banana or rice porridge)
was usually introduced in the first week of life.
Breastfeeding usually continued until about the age of
2 years.
Mothers reported that childhood diarrhoea was
commonest at the beginning of the rainy season in
November.
Table 2 lists the questionnaire responses relating to
hygiene before and after the intervention. All adults
claimed to wash their hands with water (but not soap)
after defaecation and before eating meals. About
three-quarters of mothers said they rinsed their
childrens’ hands before they ate. Soap was rarely used
but mothers knew the price and realized that it was
always readily available in their village. Surprisingly,
when soap was given out it was greeted with much
comment, touching and smelling as if it was unfamiliar.
In the intervention village after the campaign, most
women (92%) claimed to wash their hands with soap
after defaecation and! although more thought soap
was expensive (implymg perhaps that they had now
considered buying it)? the proportion who considered
that they had insufficient money dropped from 32% to
12%. This suggests that an attitudinal change regarding the importance of soap had been achieved.
The survey and fortnightly disease reviews provided a list of disease events in each family. There
were no records of chronic diarrhoea. Each new
disease episode affecting children under 11 years was
classified into (i) diarrhoea and/or vomiting, typhoid,

infections; (iii) other communicable disease (respiratory and ear infections, measles, fever, malaria); and
(iv) non-communicable disease (dizziness, toothache
and one scald). The results are summarized in Tables
3-5.

Discussion

During the short period of this study, hygiene
education combined with distribution of soap
appeared to induce an 89% fall in diarrhoea episodes
compared to the pre-intervention phase of the study.
This dramatic result must largely have been due to the
very simple nature of the message and also to the
intensive and personal nature of the hygiene education. Two of us (M. and J.) who were community
organizers spent time discussing health issues with
just 130 mothers at fortnightly intervals over 20
weeks. Whether the good effects of this campaign will
be sustained once the community organizers move to
other villages remains to be seen.

There was also a significant fall in eye disease as a

only hand-washing was stressed, not other aspects of
personal hygiene.
This dramatic fall in the incidence of childhood
diarrhoea was achieved through health messages
which simply encouraged people to wash their hands
with soap after defaecation and before contact with
food. Such simple messages seem to be appropriate
for mass health education campaigns.
