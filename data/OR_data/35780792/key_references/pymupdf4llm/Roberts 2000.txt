nfectious diarrhea is the second most common
type of infection acquired by children in child
care.[1] Numerous pathogens cause infection in

# Ichildren in child care centers.[2–6] These infections may

result in serious illness, have high secondary attack
rates in families, and carry economic costs from parent loss of work time.[2–11]

Child care is a unique environment for transmission of diarrhea and preventing transmission of disease in this setting depends on actions by child care
staff. Four studies have assessed the impact of infection control training of staff on the occurrence of
diarrhea in children. In the hallmark study by Black
et al[12] in 1979, diarrhea in child care centers was
reduced by 50% when handwashing was improved.
This and 2 subsequent studies were limited by an
important potential bias, the caregivers who received
training were also the source of information about
child illness.[12–14] Furthermore, these trials did not
control for potential confounders, such as breastfeeding or having a sibling in child care. The only trial to
address these issues reported only episodes of severe
diarrhea, in young children under 24 months of age
were reduced by training.[15] They concluded that although the intervention improved the behavior of
caregivers, it may have had a lesser impact on childto-child transmission. We set out to establish
whether infection control training could reduce episodes of diarrhea in children of all ages.

**METHODS**
We performed a cluster randomized, controlled trial of an
infection control intervention in child care centers in the Australian Capital Territory between March and November 1996. The
trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Australian
National University. Centers eligible to participate in the trial
were those licensed in the Australian Capital Territory at February
1, 1996 to care for 50 or more children for �9 hours a day, 5 days
a week. We invited directors of all eligible daycare centers to
participate. One center was a pilot site to develop and test methods for the trial and did not participate in the trial. We delivered
information booklets about the trial for staff and parents at each
center and recruited parents of children by letter delivered
through the centers. Centers were randomized to the intervention
group after the center directors agreed to participate in the trial,
using a random number table generated using EpiInfo.[16]
Children were eligible to participate if they were 3 years of age
or younger at January 1, 1996, attended the child care center for at
least 3 days per week, and had no underlying chronic illness that
predisposed to infection. A target sample size of 314 child-years of
observation was determined based on requiring 80% power to
detect a 25% reduction in diarrhea from a background rate of 1.4
infections per child-year, using a test of 5% significance level.[17] We
adjusted the sample size by a factor of 1.3 for clustering, this being
appropriate for an intracluster correlation coefficient of .01 with 20
clusters and 28 children in each cluster.[18–19] The required clustered
sample was, therefore, 408 child-years of observation or 544 children observed for 9 months.
Training for the intervention centers was performed by L.R. in
March 1996. The training incorporated elements of good health
training developed by Kendrick[20] and a exercise of handwashing
using GloGerm (Moab, UT).[21] The lessons were of 3 hours’ dura

-----

g
periods. Those staff members who joined the center after the onset
of the trial were trained in a 1-hour lesson during lunch periods.
We reinforced training and communicated techniques and routine
practices in fortnightly visits and newsletters for intervention
centers. We delivered 9 newsletters that highlighted how staff had
incorporated the hygiene methods into their daily routines. Staff
in control centers undertook training and received newsletters at
the end of the trial in November 1996.
The recommended handwashing technique is outlined in the
Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Guidelines for preventing infectious diseases in child care.[22] Only soap
was recommended as a washing agent. The duration of a handwash of an approximate “count to 10” to wash and “count to 10”
to rinse was emphasised. Child care staff members were asked to
teach the handwashing method they had learned to the children in
their care and to perform handwashes for infants. We developed
techniques to encourage children to wash their hands well, such as
the use of songs about handwashing in melodies of nursery
rhymes. The recommended circumstances for handwashing for
staff and children were on arrival at the center, after toileting,
before eating, and after changing a diaper (staff and child). We
recommended that toys were washed daily using dishwashers
where possible. Staff members who changed diapers were discouraged from preparing food for children on the same day.
The primary outcome measures were parent reports of symptoms of illness in telephone interviews every 2 weeks. To improve
the parents’ recall of illness, we issued calendars at the beginning
and middle of the trial. The calendars included definitions of
illness. The interviewers asked a standard set of questions about
respiratory and diarrheal illness, doctor diagnosis of otitis media,
medication given, health service use, and parent and child absenteeism from work and child care. The definition of diarrhea was 2
or more watery or unusually loose bowel motions in 24 hours. We
defined a new episode of diarrhea as the occurrence of diarrhea
after a period of 3 symptom-free days. Analysis of diarrheal
episodes was also performed with a new episode of diarrhea
defined as occurrence after a symptom-free period of 7 days.
Parents also completed a questionnaire about risk factors that may
modify infections as described in Table 1.
The secondary outcome measure was implementation of the
intervention. One observer recorded compliance with recommended practices for a period of 3 hours in the morning in each
center every 6 weeks. The observer was not informed of the
content of the training sessions or the intervention status of the
centers. The staff members in the centers were aware the observer
was watching hygiene practices but not which specific practices
were being recorded. We graded compliance for each child care
center, by 3 groups of children’s performance of recommended
handwashing.
We analyzed the data using Stata Statistical Software, Release
5.0.[23] We calculated incidence of diarrheal episodes per child-year
for all children and then for children in 2 age groups: over 24
months of age and 24 months of age or under. We chose this age

y
24 months of age. We constructed Poisson regression models with
robust confidence interval (CI) estimates adjusting standard errors
for the impact of clustering by center.[24–26] Our modeling strategy
followed recommendations by Kleinbaum.[27] The goal of our
model was to obtain a valid estimate of the exposure–disease
relationship. We performed backwards stepwise analysis for significant interaction terms. We applied the multivariable model for
all children and children in the 2 age groups. Further, we analyzed
the results by grading compliance in intervention centers, maintaining analysis by intent-to-treat by comparing intervention
grades with control centers.

**RESULTS**
The recruitment rate for centers was 88% (23/26).
After randomization, there were 11 intervention and
12 control centers. Sixteen of the centers were commercially operated (8 intervention and 8 control centers). There was no difference between the proportion of staff members with child care qualifications in
intervention and control centers (59/125 and 58/110,
respectively; �[2] test, P value � .4). In all centers,
children were separated by age into differing care
rooms with a range of between 3 and 5 rooms per
center. Staff to child ratios, regulated by the government, were 1 to 5 for care of infants and 1 to 12 for
care of preschool children.
Children were enrolled in the trial for 113 677
days, representing 311 child-years (see Fig 1 in the
companion to this article, page 000). One third of the
children were 1, 2, or 3 years old, respectively (see
Fig 2 in the companion to this article, page 000). The
attrition rate during the trial was 22% (51/299 and
17% intervention; 72/259 and 28% control). This coincided with offers of young retirement from the
principal employer in the city, the Commonwealth
Government of Australia.
The incidence of episodes of diarrhea per childyear was lower in intervention centers than in control centers. However, this was attributable to a decrease in infections in older children over 24 months,
not in children 24 months of age or younger (Table
2). There was no difference in incidence by intervention status in males compared with females, the stratified incidence rate ratio for males being .77 and for
females .70.
The final multivariable model adjusted for clustering by center, confounding by 11 variables and 2
significant interaction terms (being in the young age
group and intervention status and having a sibling
who attends child care and intervention status). The
confounding variables in the final model are listed in
Table 1.
Using the fully adjusted model, there was a significant reduction in diarrheal episodes of 50% in intervention center children across the full age range.
However, when the 2 groups were examined separately, the significant reduction in illness was present
only in children over 24 months of age (Table 3). The
reduction in children over 24 months of age was seen
in every month of the trial except July. The intracluster correlation coefficient for diarrhea in intervention
centers was .003 and in control centers .022. When
the definition of an episode of diarrhea was altered

diarrhea was lower in the intervention group but
was not a statistically significant reduction (RR: .54;

We graded compliance for children washing their
hands, corresponding to intervention centers with a
score of low, moderate, and high compliance. Improved compliance with infection control procedures
was associated with lower illness incidence but the
effect was still confined to older children. With high
compliance of child handwashing, diarrheal episodes were reduced by two thirds (RR: .34; Table 4).

**DISCUSSION**
This trial supports the importance of training staff
about infection control techniques to reduce episodes
of infectious diarrhea in children in child care. The
impact for children over 24 months of age was substantial with a 66% reduction in episodes of diarrhea
when children’s compliance with handwashing was
high. Children’s handwashing may not be responsible alone for reducing illness; it may be a marker of
general good performance of infection control techniques.
Our work initially seems contradictory to that by
Kotch et al[15] where severe diarrhea episodes were
reduced only in younger children under 24 months
of age. They did not find a change in all episodes of
diarrhea. Although we found no reduction in diarrhea in the younger age group, we did not separately
identify severe from all episodes of diarrhea. We,
therefore, could not identify if there was a reduction
in severe episodes.
In older children in control centers, our rate of 2.1
episodes per child-year were similar to those reported by Kotch et al[15] of 2.8 per child year. Although
they found no reduction in children over 24 months
of age, we found significant and substantial reduction. Unlike their work, our intervention did impact
on children’s behavior, and presumably, child-tochild transmission as shown by observations of children’s handwashing. From �24 months of age, children become independent with toileting and
handwashing. It is not surprising that if the intervention impacted on child-to-child transmission, reductions in illness would occur in this older age group.
Another explanation for reduction of diarrhea in
only children over 24 months of age may be interruption of transmission of pathogen(s) that caused
diarrhea in older, but not in younger, children. We
were not able to collect fecal specimens for microbiologic tests and cannot comment on which pathogens were reduced.
Our work has some limitations but these do not
invalidate our conclusions. We did not directly inform parents of their center’s intervention status, but
they may have recognized this from other sources
and parent reporting of illness may have been biased
by this knowledge. The recording of compliance with
infection control practices could have been prone to
bias from the observer or children may have changed
their behavior when she was present. We argue that
children were not likely to change their behavior to
impress the observer and that their handwashing
followed a routine that was not readily alterable. The
dropout rate in the control group was higher than in


-----

This is unlikely as the out-migration occurred from
children reducing their care attendance at a time of
downturn in employment in the city. The families in
this trial were predominantly affluent, Caucasian,
with 2 parents in the home, and our findings may not
be generalizable to all circumstances. Children from
these affluent homes may be at lower risk of acquiring diarrhea than others.
This study supports the need for training of child
care staff about infection control methods. Our new
evidence is the substantial reduction of episodes of
diarrhea in children over 24 months of age, an effect
we consider resulted from interruption of child-tochild transmission.
