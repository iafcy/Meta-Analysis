We aimed to assess the effectiveness of an educational and hand hygiene program in daycare centers (DCCs)
and homes on acute gastroenteritis (AGE) incidence in children attending DCCs.
METHODS: A randomized, controlled, and open study of 911 children aged 0-3 years attending 24 DCCs in
Almería (Spain) with an 8-month follow-up was employed. Two intervention groups of DCCs families performed educational and hand hygiene measures, 1 with soap and water (soap and water group; n = 274),
another with hand sanitizer (hand sanitizer group [HSG]; n = 339), and the control group (CG; n = 298) followed usual handwashing procedures. We compared AGE episode rates with Poisson regression model.
RESULTS: seven hundred fourteen AGE episodes were registered, significant differences between HSG and CG
children were found during December and January. A multivariate model was applied and the adjusted incidence rate ratios by rotavirus vaccination found significant differences when children were previously vaccinated, the children in the soap and water group had a higher risk of AGE episodes (incidence rate ratio: 1.28,
95% confidence interval:1.0-1.64), compared with those in the HSG.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that hand hygiene programs that included hand sanitizer were most
effective in the winter months. Further, the largest reduction of AGE episodes occurred in the children that
followed hand hygiene programs including hand sanitizer and educational measures for DCC staff, parents,
and children, and were vaccinated for rotavirus.

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in children under 5 years worldwide.[1][,][2] In developed countries, it is an important cause of primary care and emergency visits,
hospitalization, and medication prescription, especially in children
attending daycare centers (DCCs).[3-10] Diarrhea incidence ranges from
0.5 to 2 episodes/y in children under three years in the European

Union,[11] with rotavirus being the most frequent cause of severe
diarrhea.[6][,][11][,][12] Rotavirus vaccines have been available in Spain since
2006 and have had a great impact on severe AGE prevention and
rotavirus disease burden reduction.[13-19]

Handwashing is the most important and effective measure to prevent infection transmission.[20][,][21] Hydroalcoholic gels or hand sanitizers are virucides and bactericides against gastrointestinal and
respiratory pathogens.[22-26]

Meta-analyses and systematic reviews[27-29] found that handwashing can reduce the risk of diarrhea by 31%-47%. Handwashing

promotion (education activities, sometimes with the provision of
soap) at DCCs or schools prevents approximately 30% of diarrhea episodes in high-income countries.[30]

There are studies that assess the impact of hand hygiene programs
on infectious disease transmission reduction in schools[31-35] and
households.[36][,][37] However, there are few recent studies that evaluate
their effectiveness in DCCs,[38-40] specifically, those examining the
importance of hand hygiene health education for DCC-staff and
parents to reduce infection transmission in DCCs.[37][,][41][,][42]

Few randomized studies regarding the effectiveness of hand
hygiene programs (hand sanitizer vs handwashing vs control) linked
to a decrease in AGE in DCCs in developed countries have been published. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of an educational and
hand hygiene program in DCCs and homes on AGE incidence in children at the individual level, and the association of sociodemographic
characteristics and personal background with incidence AGE in
children.

METHODS

Design

An 8-month (November 2013-June 2014) cluster, randomized,
controlled, and open study of 3 cohorts of families with children aged
0-3 years attending 25 state DCCs in the Almeria metropolitan area
(Spain) was designed. The Delegation of Education provided the
information for 52 state DCCs. These were randomized after each
administration agreed to participate; 25 DCCs were randomly
selected, and after DCCs were assigned to one of the intervention
groups (IG) or the control group (CG) by using statistical software
(Epidat 4.0, Coselleria de Sanidad de Xunta de Galicia, Spain) for a
1:1:1 ratio randomization. The 25 randomized DCC administrations
informed parents by mail with the following documents: a study
information sheet, an authorization form, and a questionnaire about
AGE risk factors (Table 1). Before starting the study, parents authorized their children’s participation and knew which group their children belonged to.
Inclusion criteria: Children between 0 and 3 years old enrolled in
the aforementioned DCCs and attending at least 15 hours per week
whose parents and/or guardians had signed an informed consent
document were included.
Exclusion criteria: Children with chronic illnesses or taking medication that could affect their likelihood of contracting an infection
were excluded.

Sample size

A cluster sampling design[44] was used, with proportional allocation to the size of the cluster. The clusters were the DCCs for children
in Almeria.
There were 52 DCCs, with 50 children per DCC on average. As in
another study[11] for an incidence rate of 1.6, we assumed a 20% reduction in AGE incidence rate in the experimental groups with respect to
the CG during the study period. Minimum selections of 6 DCCs per
group were needed for a statistical power of 80% and a 5% significance level. A 10% variation coefficient was considered, and the average sample size was 30 children per cluster, to account for families
that may decline study participation. Furthermore, an increase of 2
DCCs per group were randomly selected for the CG and soap and
water group (SWG); and 3 DCCs for hand sanitizer group (HSG), with
at least 240 children per group, for possible follow-up losses. The
expected loss to follow-up was higher in the HSG because of parents’

Intervention

One month before study initiation (October 1-3, 2013) parents
and DCC-staff assigned to intervention groups (IGs) (HSG and SWG)
and the CG attended 1-hour hand hygiene workshops, which were
designed and taught by the researchers. All participating families and
DCC-staff attended. The content included education about handwashing practices and hand sanitizers use, possible side effects, and
precautionary measures (only for the HSG).
Researchers instructed both IGs’ children/parents and DCC-staff to
maintain usual handwashing procedures after using the toilet and
when their hands were visibly dirty. Both IGs followed protocol in
these circumstances: after coming into the classroom; before and
after lunch; after playing outside; when they went home; and after
coughing; sneezing or blowing their noses; after diapering. In the
HSG and SWG classrooms, hand sanitizer and liquid soap dispensers
were installed, respectively, and informational brochures about
when and how to perform hand hygiene were available. IG families
were provided the same informational brochure and supplies of hand
sanitizer (HSG) or liquid soap (SWG) for home use during the study
period by the research assistant in the DCCs. The HSG children were
supervised by DCC-staff and parents when using hand sanitizer, and
for young children, it was administered by DCC-staff and parents. The
CG followed usual handwashing procedures. Hand sanitizer characteristics: ethyl alcohol 70%, pH = 7.0-7.5. The liquid soaps used for
handwashing in the SWG did not contain specific antibacterial components (pH = 5.5).
During the follow-up, researchers organized 2 identical training
sessions per DCC for parents and/or DCC staff in the IGs that were
given 1 month apart, the first 3 on respiratory infections and AGE

to attend training in their own DCC were invited to attend sessions in
other centers. The workshop content was sent by e-mail to the IGs.
Every 2 weeks, the research assistant and DCC-staff performed the
same activities (stories, songs, and posters in the classrooms and
DCCs) regarding hand hygiene and infection transmission.

Data collection and illness definitions

During October 2013, parents completed the baseline questionnaire and gave it to the DCC staff. Information about DCCs was provided by the staff (Table 1). Beginning on November 1, 2013, DCCstaff collected parent-completed AGE episode (with or without DCC
absenteeism) sheets, which reported AGE symptoms, treatments,
contact with medical services, and complementary analyses. The
research assistant collected the episode sheets weekly and telephoned absent children’s parents to inquire about the absence
causes. The DCC staff and/or parents in the IGs were asked if the hand
sanitizer or soap caused any side effects in the children.
AGE was defined as a decrease in stool consistency (loose or liquid) and/or an increase in frequency (typically ≥3 in 24 hours), with
or without fever or vomiting, according to the ESPGHAN definition.[11]

During follow-up, the research pediatricians extracted AGE episode medical data and checked rotavirus vaccination status from the
Department of Health’s electronic records. International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification[45] diagnosis codes
were used: diarrhea (787.91), or gastroenteritis (558.9).
In 2010, the Spanish Agency of Medicine suspended the commercialization of both rotavirus vaccines (not funded by the government)
for 5 months in the case of the pentavalent vaccine (June-November
2010), and for 6 years for the monovalent vaccine (June 2010-June
2016). From 2011 to 2014, only the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine
was available in Spain, and the vaccination schedule was at 2-4-6
months old.
The medical researchers made the final diagnosis based on the
symptoms described above and a review of the medical history of
children with AGE.
In this study, a DCC absenteeism episode was defined as when a
child fails to attend a DCC because of AGE. We also recorded AGE episodes without DCC absenteeism. A new AGE episode was considered
to be the occurrence of AGE after a period of 3 symptom-free days, as
in other studies.[36][,][39] The duration of absenteeism was defined as the
number of DCC days missed due to AGE, excluding weekends and
holidays.

Outcome measures

The AGE incidence rate was calculated by the number of AGE episodes divided by the number of children during the study period. The
incidence rate ratio (IRR) was defined as the ratio of AGE between 2
groups. Percentage of AGE absenteeism days in the 3 groups calculated as the ratio of AGE absenteeism days to all possible study period
attendance days. The total possible days of attendance was calculated
as the total number of children multiplied by the possible attendance
days.

Statistical analysis

Children�s socio-demographic and DCC characteristics in the 3
study groups were compared by using x[2] tests, Fisher-Snedecor distribution from analysis of variance, Welch test, and Brown-Forsythe
test with a 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
A multilevel Poisson regression model was applied to fit the number of AGE events. Two levels were considered: children grouped
into classrooms by age (0-1, 1-2, and 2-3 years) and DCC random


into account overdispersion in the Poisson mode.[46-48] We used observation-level random effects to model overdispersion in counting data
for ecology and evolution. First, an unadjusted covariate model was
applied to check the IRR of AGE for each covariate of study applied.
Thus, adjustment for variables in Table 1 was calculated. Finally, a full
multivariate model with all variables under study was applied, and
model reduction was conducted by using a backward procedure.
Covariates were removed if no significant association with the
parameter was detected, if no interaction effect with group was
found, and when no change in the rest of parameters was observed
after removal (considering a 30% of change as a possible confounder).[49][,][50] Goodness of fit of the model in each step was performed by checking residuals and the Bayesian information criteria.
The adjusted IRR from the multivariate model is provided along with
its 95% CI. The percentage of days absent from a DCC was compared
with Poisson exact test results.
The statistical tests were performed at a 5% significance level by
using SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) and R version 3.1.3 (R
Foundation, Austria).
This study was reviewed and approved by the ethical review
board for clinical trials at Hospital Torrecardenas (Almeria, Spain),
and permission to review medical records was also granted.

RESULTS

Fifty-two DCCs were initially contacted, of which 25 were randomized with 1176 children, and 960 (81.63%) had parental participation authorization. Approximately 95% of parents returned the
completed questionnaire and AGE data collection notebook, so the
final sample size was 911 children. Approximately 5% of the children
did not complete the study; this did not affect the results as confirmed by nonreported analyses. One child in the HSG showed worsening of localized atopic dermatitis due to hand sanitizer gel use and
was excluded during the follow-up (Fig 1).

Table 2 includes the 3 groups’ sociodemographic and DCC
characteristics. Significant between-group differences were found
including more SWG families had immigrant status, and the
parents had lower social class and educational level. All DCCs met
the requirements regarding facilities, material conditions, square
meters per child, number of courses per DCC, and the number of
children per staff member stipulated by the government.[51] The
potential biases were controlled by including these variables in
the multilevel analysis, adjusting the incidence rates of AGE by
them (Table 1).
During the study period, 714 AGE episodes occurred (242 CG, 231
SWG, 241 HSG); a doctor confirmed diagnoses in 79.3% of episodes.
Figure 2 shows AGE incidence per child and per month. Significant
differences between the HSG versus CG were found when children
had more AGE episodes, in December and January, P < .05.

Table 3 includes the final adjusted multivariate model. The
adjusted incidence rate ratios by rotavirus vaccination show significant differences when children had been previously vaccinated. For
children with rotavirus vaccination, the risk of AGE when using soap
and water was significantly higher than when using hand sanitizer
(IRR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.0-1.64). Note that male sex and child age at DCC
initiation were also significantly associated with AGE. No other variables were significant.
Pupils missed 1781 DCC days due to AGE (CG = 584, SWG = 594,
HSG = 603). The total possible days of attendance were 44,998 (CG),
41,374 (SWG), and 51,189 (HSG). The percentage of AGE absenteeism
days was not significantly lower in the HSG (1.17%, 95% CI: 1.08-1.27)
compared to SWG (1.43%, 95% CI: 1.32-1.55), P = .051 and CG (1.29%,

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies the effectiveness of educational and hand hygiene programs (hand sanitizer vs
hand-washing vs control) in DCCs and homes on AGE incidence in
children attending DCCs. Significant differences regarding AGE episodes between HSG and CG were found during the months of December and January. A randomized study[39] observed a 50% reduction in
AGE episodes in children over 24 months of age attending DCCs who
followed a hand hygiene intervention with hand sanitizers. We found
significant differences in the winter months, this may be because
these months had an increase of AGE episodes and this is when the
intervention may be more effective (Fig 2). A similar winter peak seasonal influence has been reported in other industrialized
countries[9][,][52][,][53] and it suggests contributions of rotavirus and norovirus to the increased AGE incidence in children at DCCs.[9]

For children with rotavirus vaccination, we found a 28% higher
risk of AGE, when belonging to the SWG instead of the HSG. Lennell
et al[40] separately measure both interventions and found a 12% reduction of absenteeism due to infections in the HSG compared with using
soap. Our results of a lower incidence of AGE in HSG versus SWG
(0.72/child/study period vs 0.93/child/study period) were in part due
to an increase in rotavirus vaccine coverage in the HSG (77.9%) compared with SWG (59.5%), according to others studies,[15][,][17][,][54][,][55] and in
part due to the herd effect of rotavirus vaccination.[56] In addition, the
virucidal effect[22][,][23] and greater adherence to the hand hygiene program with hand sanitizer than to the soap-and-water program may
explain the results, as educational measures were the same in both
groups in our study. Families and/or DCC staff used 1660 L of hand


hand sanitizer per disinfection, we estimated that each child used
hand sanitizer between 6 and 8 times per day. Families and/or DCC
staff used 890 L of liquid soap during the study period; with the
expected use of 1-1,5 mL of soap per washing, we estimated that
each child washed their hands with soap between 3 and 5 times per
day.
Other studies,[57][,][58] did not observe a significant reduction in AGE
episodes in children attending DCCs following hand hygiene interventions. However, comparing our results with previous studies is
difficult for several reasons: the differences in design, most of the
studies conducted at DCCs were prior to the availability of rotavirus
vaccines,[38][,][39][,][59] and others do not analyze its influence on the gastroenteritis incidence.[57][,][58] Hand hygiene is known to be an effective
measure to prevent the transmission of AGE.[27-30] However, the best
way to prevent rotavirus diarrhea is rotavirus vaccination.[17][,][19][,][60]

The children in the HSG had fewer DCC absence days due to AGE
than those in the SWG and CG, and there was near statistical significance between the HSG and SWG. This was in line with another
study,[40] and indicates a possible reduction in the use of medical
resources and parent work absenteeism.
Previous studies found different results regarding the association
of gender with infectious diseases.[39][,][53][,][61][,][62] In our study girls had a
lower risk of AGE than boys.
Children who were older at DCC initiation were less at risk of gastroenteritis than younger children, in line with other studies[7][,][53][,][61] it
is probably due to greater maturity of the immune system.
Families from different socioeconomic levels and countries of origin, as well as children who used public and private health services,
took part in our study, so our findings are likely representative of the

generalized in similar DCCs in Spain and with similar vaccination
coverages against rotavirus because most of the AGE episodes were
diagnosed by a doctor. As other authors indicate[53][,][63] the risk and protective factors of infections in children at DCCs are difficult to identify, and their importance may vary between societies and countries.
Therefore, these results may not be generalizable to DCCs where sociodemographic factors, infrastructure, and rotavirus vaccination coverages are substantially different.
Future studies are needed to assess which factors of multicomponent interventions may be most effective in reducing infections in
children attending DCCs.

Limitations

Although 79.3% of AGE episodes had medical diagnoses, there was


7.69%) as its diagnosis is clinical in most cases. Approximately 90% of
children under 3 years old in Almeria attend state and state-subsidized,
privately run DCCs, but we did not have access to exclusively private
centers. The number of parents who did not authorize the study was
greater in the CG, however, this did not affect the sample size. Masking
both participants and researchers was not feasible given the study characteristics, so the statistical analyses were masked until completion. We
did not monitor the IGs program compliance through continuous
hand hygiene behavior observation as in most DCC intervention
studies;[40][,][57][,][59] however previous researchers[64-66] found that individuals
might change their behavior when aware of observation. Nevertheless,
we monitor the IGs hand hygiene material consumption. Only the IGs
received educational intervention making the relative contributions of
education versus hand hygiene in the reduction of AGE episodes unattainable in this study. Another potential limitation is that we do not

Multivariate adjusted IRR for episodes due to AGE in children at DCCs

Groups IRR 95% CI P

Rotavirus vaccination (RV) CG vs SWG 0.96 0.76-1.23 .77
CG vs HSG 1.24 0.99-1.55 .07
SWG vs HSG 1.28 1.0-1.64 .04
No Rotavirus vaccination (Non-RV) CG vs SWG 0.86 0.58-1.26 .44
CG vs HSG 0.93 0.60-1.42 .73

Age at the start of DCC attendance 0.98 0.97-0.99 .01
.02
Sex (male vs female) 1.22 1.03-1.44 .02

The final multilevel analysis was adjusted by age at start of DCC attendance, sex (female vs male) and rotavirus vaccine (interaction effect between rotavirus vaccination and group).
The DCC characteristics considered were hygiene intervention groups at the DCC (none, soap, or hand sanitizer)
CG, control group; CI, confidence interval; HSG, hand sanitizer group; IRR, incidence rate ratio; RV, rotavirus vaccine; SWG soap and water group.


However, randomization was performed by DCC (all children in each
DCC belonged to the same group) so there would be no contamination
between groups.

CONCLUSIONS

This study demonstrated that hand hygiene programs that
included hand sanitizer were most effective in the winter months
with the highest incidence of AGE in children at DCCs. Further, the
largest reduction of AGE episodes occurred in the children that followed hand hygiene programs including hand sanitizer and educational measures for DCC staff, parents, and children, and were
vaccinated for rotavirus.
