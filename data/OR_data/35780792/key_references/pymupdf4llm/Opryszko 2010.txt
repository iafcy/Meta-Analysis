### ABSTRACT


A randomized controlled trial of four interventions was conducted using tubewells (n ¼ 2,486),

liquid sodium hypochlorite (‘Clorin’) distributed with an improved water vessel (n ¼ 2,305),

hygiene promotion (n ¼ 1,877), and a combination of the three (n ¼ 2,040) to create an evidence
base for water policy in Afghanistan. A fifth group served as a control (n ¼ 2,377). Interventions

were randomized across 32 villages in Wardak province. Outcomes were measured through two

household surveys separated by one year and twice-weekly household surveillance conducted

over 16 months. The households receiving all three interventions showed reduction in diarrhoea

compared with the control group, through both longitudinal surveillance data (IRR [95% CI] ¼ 0.61

[0.47–0.81]) and cross-sectional survey data (AOR [95% CI] ¼ 0.53 [0.30–0.93]). This reduction was

significant when all household members were included, but did not reach significance when only

children under five were considered. These results suggest multi-barrier methods are necessary

where there are many opportunities for water contamination. Surveillance data suggested a

greater impact of interventions on reducing diarrhoeal diseases than data from the surveys.

Higher economic status as measured through household assets was associated with lower rates

of diarrhoea and greater intervention uptake, excepting Clorin. Use of soap was also associated

with lower prevalence of diarrhoea.

Two decades of conflict have left the people of Afghanistan

with poor health status and a heavily damaged infrastruc
ture. Among Afghans, 22% of the total population, 37% of

the urban and 17% of the rural population are estimated to

have access to drinking water from improved sources such

as boreholes, protected wells and piped water (UNICEF

2009). Sources commonly used for drinking water by

Afghans include shallow wells and surface water that are

vulnerable to faecal contamination. Afghanistan is among

the most water scarce countries in the world (UNDP 2004).

In addition, UNICEF (2009) estimates that 70% of the total

doi: 10.2166/wh.2010.121


population lack adequate sanitation. A 2001 study in Faryab

Province found 25% of deaths across all age groups were

associated with diarrhoea while diarrhoea was present in

30.5% of deaths of children less than five years and in 40%

of deaths in children five to nine years old (Assefa et al.

2001). Other studies in Afghanistan have placed the two
week prevalence of diarrhoea between 20 and 50% for

children under five resulting in an estimated 85,000 annual

childhood deaths (UNDP 2004; UNICEF 2006a). World
wide, unsafe water, poor hygiene and uncontrolled faeces

disposal are thought to contribute to about 1.5 to 1.8 million

deaths of children each year (UNDP 2006; UNICEF 2006b).

Repeated bouts of diarrhoea can contribute to stunting and

wasting. In Afghanistan this is an important risk as it is

estimated that 49% of children under five are underweight,

50% are stunted and 10% are wasted (UNDP 2004).

This study was undertaken in Wardak province from

May 2005 through September 2006 to provide an evidence

base for diarrhoea reduction policies in rural Afghanistan.

The primary study hypothesis was that villages rando
mized to receive interventions would have a reduction in

diarrhoea greater than that of villages randomized to

the control group. Funding was provided by the Ministry

of Public Health (MOPH) of the Islamic Republic of

Afghanistan.

### METHODS

Design

This study measured the effectiveness of three individual

interventions and the joint effect of the three to reduce

household diarrhoeal diseases. Diarrhoea was defined as

three or more loose or watery stools in the previous 24

hours in accordance with the MOPH definition. Addition
ally, a household was defined as the group of people who

ate together the previous evening.

The study was designed with 400 households in each of

four intervention groups and a control group. This sample

size was adequate to detect a 20% change in both diarrhoeal

incidence and prevalence, assuming a 5% weekly incidence

for children under five. The study assumed a design effect of

two and an average household size of six.

The interventions tested were: (1) liquid sodium

hypochlorite (‘Clorin’) produced in Afghanistan and mar
keted along with an improved water vessel and training on

proper use; (2) hygiene education (‘Hygiene’); (3) improved

tubewells (‘Wells’); and (4) all three interventions together

(‘All’). Each of these interventions has been shown to be

effective in reducing diarrhoea in studies elsewhere (Esrey

et al. 1991; Mintz et al. 1995; Quick et al. 1999; 2006; Curtis &

Cairncross 2003; Luby et al. 2004; Fewtrell et al. 2005;

Clasen et al. 2006), but there is little evidence regarding

their level of effectiveness in Afghanistan. Diarrhoea was

also measured in a control population (‘Control’).


Clorin

This liquid point-of-use disinfectant developed by the Pan

American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Centers for

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a 0.05% sodium

hypochlorite solution produced through electrolysis.

Previous studies have suggested that Clorin, along with an

improved water vessel and instructions on proper use, could

reduce diarrhoea prevalence by 15–48% (Quick et al. 1999).

At the time of the study social marketing of Clorin had

recently begun in Afghanistan supported by the United

States Agency for International Development (USAID).

Clorin is intended for household uses and leaves a chlorine

residual (Macy & Quick 2002; WHO 2002; Wright et al.

2004). A bottle of Clorin is expected to treat enough

drinking water for a household of six for one month

(PSI 2005). Each bottle of Clorin was labelled with

illustrated and written instructions, translated into the

local languages of Pashto and Dari, on the proper use of

the product. A pamphlet outlining instructions on the

proper use of Clorin through illustrations and text was also

distributed to each household receiving Clorin. Addition
ally, the Clorin bottle cap was marked for measuring

appropriate doses for treating either 10 litres or 20 litres

of water. A 20-litre plastic vessel was distributed with Clorin

that had a narrow mouth, tight-fitting lid, spigot and

markings at 10 and 20 litre volumes. Educators, in teams

of one male and one female, visited ‘Clorin’ and ‘All’

households twice in the summer of 2005 with approxi
mately one month between visits.

Clorin was delivered monthly to study households from

June 2005 through September 2006. Population Services

International (PSI) supplied Clorin and improved water

vessels as well as the training of Clorin educators for the

study interventions. Management Sciences for Health, and

COMRI-A assumed Clorin production and distribution in

Afghanistan in 2006.

Hygiene education

Hygiene plays an important role in diarrhoeal disease

transmission, with numerous studies demonstrating the

association between poor hygiene practices and increased

risk of diarrhoea (Knight et al. 1992; Gorter et al. 1998;


-----

689 M. C. Opryszko et al. | Water and hygiene interventions: Afghanistan Journal of Water and Health | 08.4 | 2010


Luby et al. 2004). As a result of high diarrhoeal disease rates

in Afghanistan, hygiene education has become a regular

feature of many Afghan health projects but there is little

data on the effectiveness of these projects (MOPH 2001;

UNICEF 2006a).

The study utilized a hygiene education curriculum

produced by PSI and USAID. Hygiene education messages

were communicated through pictures printed on large

cards and accompanied by spoken hygiene messages on

safe water practices relating to five key messages:

1. Use protected drinking water

2. Improve environmental sanitation; use and maintain

latrines

3. Improve personal hygiene, especially hand washing

practices

4. Protect food from contamination

5. Use oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for diarrhoea.

Teams of PSI-trained educators delivered these

messages in house-to-house visits lasting approximately

30 minutes each. Each team consisted of one male and one

female. Teams focused the messages to adult women in each

household because women in Afghanistan are generally

responsible for household water supplies and hygiene

behaviours (Klijn 2002). The teams visited households in

the ‘Hygiene’ and ‘All’ groups twice during the summer of

2005 with approximately one month between each visit.

Improved wells

Wells were constructed by local contractors primarily using

percussion equipment. The Danish Committee for Aid to

Afghan Refugees (DACAAR), which has managed water

projects in Afghanistan since 1998, oversaw and coordinated

all well construction. In a few villages diamond-tipped rotary

drills were needed because of the geology of the rock

underlying some villages. The new tubewells were placed in

order to provide approximately one well per 25 households,

with each well providing at least 25 litres/person/day, the

Afghanistan national standard (Government of Afghanistan

2004a). An engineer worked with each community to

establish agreement for well sites. Tubewells were sited to

ensure community ownership, accessibility for women and

adequate distance from sources of contamination such as


latrines, livestock and other waste sites. In one village, a

non-functioning existing tubewell was repaired instead of

constructing a new one. All villages agreed to support

post-construction well maintenance.

All three interventions

Villages in this study group received all three interventions

implemented in the same way as individual interventions,

and implemented simultaneously.

Control

Villages randomized to the control group did not receive

any active intervention. At the end of the study, all

villages that did not receive new tubewells as part of their

intervention had new wells installed.

Changes to study design

Interventions began in June 2005 and were expected to be

fully implemented by the end of July 2005, with data

collection to continue until the end of September 2005.

Completion of the wells within the two-month implemen
tation period was not possible. Difficulties experienced

during the study included lack of water-bearing rock

strata and the need for scarce rotary drilling equipment

to penetrate the rock. Additional barriers included violent

attacks and intimidations against well-drilling staff and

participating villages from insurgents outside the commu
nities who threatened study sites. Because of these multiple

difficulties encountered during well construction, the study

was extended by one year to allow additional time to

construct wells. Well drillers were unable to complete wells

in one village that was randomized to ‘Wells’ and one

village randomized to ‘All’.

Study population and sampling

Wardak Province, west of Kabul, was chosen as the study

site because of its large rural population, high prevalence of

diarrhoea, lack of improved water sources, accessibility to

Kabul-based staff and relative security at the project start.

The estimated population was 413,000, with 99% living in

rural areas (Government of Afghanistan 2003). National

population indicators consisting of statistics on health,

environment, education and women’s status ranked

Wardak 7th highest of 34 provinces (UNICEF 2006a). In a

2004 health facility catchment survey, prevalence of

diarrhoeal diseases in the preceding 30 days in Wardak

was 34% for children under five and 12% across all ages.

In the same survey, the national prevalence rates for

diarrhoeal diseases in the preceding 30 days were 43% for

children under five and 25% for all ages (Government of

Afghanistan 2004b). Within Wardak, Sayadabad District

was selected as the project site based on a 2004 DACAAR

survey that found 76% of Sayadabad’s villages lacked

adequate improved water sources to meet government

standards of one protected water source per 25 households

(DACAAR 2004). Villages identified for this study had less

than one improved water source per 50 households.

Thirty-four villages were systematically randomized into

one of five study groups to ensure comparability between

intervention groups. The sampling frame first stratified

villages by need for improved water, as measured by surface

water usage reported in the 2004 DACAAR survey, and

then by population size, as reported by village elders. Each

of the five intervention groups was then assigned a number

from one to five. A random starting number from one to five

was assigned to the village at the top of the list while the

next village on the list was assigned the next sequential

number. The assignment of intervention groups followed in

numerical order, cycling through the five numbers corre
sponding to the five intervention groups until all villages

were assigned to an intervention group. Village locations

within the project area represented a variety of environ
mental conditions including fertile river valleys, rocky

hilltops and flat plateaus, with the majority of sites being

arid. Only one intervention group was initiated in any

village or geographically separated portion of a village in

order to limit crossover between interventions.

The number of households enrolled from any one village

ranged from 11 to 120 households. In villages smaller than

120 households, all households were asked to participate.

In villages larger than 120 households, a random start was

used to select four groups of 30 households each. Enrolled

households agreed to adhere to the study protocols and the

intervention to which they were randomized, including

obtaining water from specific sources, chlorinating domestic


water, reporting to the survey team information on

household diarrhoea as requested, and agreeing to not resell

supplies provided to the household.

Adjustments in study population

The project was intended to be entirely located in

Sayadabad; however, inaccurate maps resulted in several

villages in neighbouring Chak District being included in

the study (Figure 1). Two villages were excluded after

randomization but before data analysis when existing

protected wells were discovered; therefore 32 villages

were included in the data analyses. Also, two villages

overlapped with an intensive sanitation and hygiene project

implemented by an NGO, one village mistakenly received

new tubewells in addition to their intended intervention of

hygiene education and two villages were not able to have

new wells completed.

Data collection

Outcomes were measured through cross-sectional house
hold surveys conducted in May 2005 and May 2006 to

measure changes in diarrhoea prevalence and longitudinal

twice-weekly household surveillance from June 2005

through September 2006 to measure diarrhoea incidence.

A household census was conducted in the summer of

Figure 1 | Study site, Wardak province, Afghanistan.

2005 and again at the end of September 2006 to determine

the total population at risk for disease. Results presented

here represent 17 months of continuous data collection

(Figure 2).

Cross-sectional data

Sixteen surveyors were trained for the baseline survey while

20 surveyors were trained for the follow-up survey. Training

lasted two days for each survey. Survey instruments were

translated into Pashto and Dari and field-tested within

Kabul while all surveys actually administered in Wardak

were conducted in Pashto, the dominant language of that

region. Surveyors worked in pairs with one female and one

male in accordance with local customs. Information from

the primary adult female caregiver was sought as the most

reliable source of information on diarrhoea occurrence

and water handling within the household (Klijn 2002).

Surveys collected data on household demographics, hygiene,

water collection, water storage and diarrhoeal disease

occurrence along with observations of water storage, hand

washing facilities and sanitation. The follow-up survey

contained questions and observations similar to the baseline

along with questions on household assets and adult

education levels. Field supervisors monitored survey data

collection daily.

Surveillance data

The surveillance data was collected mainly by community

health workers (CHWs) who were assigned to collect data

in villages away from their home villages. Where commu
nity health workers were not available, personnel from local

health clinics were employed as data collectors. For cultural

reasons female data collectors could only work in the

company of male relatives. Of the 20 disease surveillance

teams, two were unable to locate females available to work

outside their homes and the resulting teams were all male.

Surveillance data consisted of diarrhoea and bloody

diarrhoea occurrences for all household members and

was collected from households twice each week. Field

supervisors checked surveillance data twice monthly.

Unannounced monitoring by field staff was conducted at

least three times in all project villages.

Missing data that could not be verified or referenced

from existing data was left as missing, with no imputation of

missing data. Chlorine residuals in the ‘Clorin’ and ‘All’

groups were randomly checked throughout the study

period by surveillance data collectors and field supervisors

using LaMotte Insta-Test3 strips (LaMotte Company,

Chestertown, Maryland).

Data analysis

Cross-sectional data

To investigate the effects of the interventions on diarrhoea

prevalence, logistic regression models were used to estimate

adjusted pre-post odds ratios comparing the odds of

diarrhoea at the follow-up survey with the odds of diarrhoea

at the baseline survey in each intervention and control

group, as well as ratios of odds ratios comparing the pre
post odds ratio in each intervention group with the pre-post

odds ratio in the control group. Household variables found

to be associated with diarrhoea prevalence at baseline were

included in the final models along with an economic status

indicator derived from the assets index to adjust for

potential confounding.

The analysis was done with both household and

individuals within the household as the units of analysis.

In addition, clustering was considered by village and by

household for the household-as-unit-of-analysis and indi
vidual-as-unit-of-analysis, respectively, using the Huber–

White sandwich estimators for the variance (Froot 1989).

Baseline data was entered in Microsoft Excel in Kabul

with each entry checked for accuracy by a second person.

The follow-up survey data was double entered in CSPro (US

Census Bureau free software) in Kabul. Data from both

surveys was analysed in Stata 9.2 (StataCorp, College

Station, Texas) in Kabul and Baltimore.

Asset index

Questions about household assets were added to the

follow-up survey. The household assets score was developed

from principal component analysis of Wardak provincial

data in the 2004 National Community Health Feedback

Assessment (NCHFA) (Government of Afghanistan 2004b)

and used the following formula:

Household asset score ¼ [(value of asset variable 2

unweighted mean of asset variable)/unweighted standard

deviation of asset variable] £ ‘raw’ asset factor score

(Gwatkin et al. 2000).

Individual standardized scores were generated for

each household asset based on ownership. The standar
dized household asset scores were added to create a total

household asset score. Households were ranked and then

divided into five quintiles. The household asset scores and

the quintile cut off points were then applied to the database

to generate a household asset index (Vyas & Kumaranayake

2006). The 2004 NCHFA Wardak sample was used as the

reference. The households were then classified by asset

ownership based on general clustering of scores into three

groups: the poorest 40%, middle 40% and least poor 20%.

Surveillance data

Incidence rate ratios were used to investigate the effects of

the interventions on diarrhoea incidence between interven
tion and control groups. Owing to the delays in well

construction, data analyses focus on the four-month period

of June–September 2006 when all interventions had been


completed to the extent possible. For each household visit

during that time, a person was considered to have an

incident case of diarrhoea if: (1) he or she was recorded as

having diarrhoea at that visit; and (2) he or she did not have

diarrhoea at the visit immediately preceding it. Because the

population within each village fluctuated over the course of

the study, total person-time under surveillance was calcu
lated using an estimate of average village population during

the study period, for which the mean of the population

count in the surveillance data and the count in the follow
up survey was used. At-risk person-time within each village

was calculated by multiplying the average population

estimate by the number of weeks under surveillance (17.3)

to get total person time, and then subtracting out the

person-time not at risk for an incident case of diarrhoea,

which was the time between study visits following a positive

assessment of diarrhoea summed across individuals in the

village. Finally, for each village, the total number of incident

cases was divided by the total at-risk person-time to

obtain the village level incidence rates. Intervention group

incidence rates were the population-weighted mean of the

village level incidence rates. The population number used is

the mean of the surveillance and post-survey numbers.

Monthly prevalence of diarrhoea was also estimated

in each intervention group for the entire June 2005–

September 2006 study period, by dividing the number of

individuals with reported diarrhoea at any point during the

month by the estimated population. Disease surveillance

data was entered in Microsoft Excel in Kabul, with each entry

checked for accuracy by a second person and analysed

using R software (GNU Project free software) in Baltimore.

While the original randomization to study groups was

kept for the primary analyses, sub-analyses were also

conducted excluding the five villages that did not received

interventions as prescribed by the randomization. The study

was designed to examine effectiveness of interventions

rather than efficacy. Intention-to-treat analysis was used

to retain original randomization for all primary analyses

(Hollis & Campbell 1999).

Ethical approval

Free and informed consent of the participants or their legal

representatives was obtained and the study protocol was


-----

approved by the Institutional Review Board of the

Ministry of Public Health of the Islamic Republic of

Afghanistan in Kabul (#357705, approved 10 April 2005)

and by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public

Health, Institutional Review Board, Maryland, USA

(#H.22.04.12.21.A2, approved 28 February 2005). All

interventions were provided to study households at no

monetary cost. Permission to conduct the study within the

region was received from local, district and provincial

leaders. No village refused to participate.

### RESULTS

Baseline data

Twenty-five households refused participation at baseline,

1.6% of the total households visited. Household popu
lations reported by village leaders were consistently higher

than actual populations found during the study. Expected

enrolment was 400 households per study group while actual

enrolment ranged from 279 to 330 households per study

group at baseline. The distribution of participants by

intervention is shown in Figure 3.

The baseline survey population of 1,514 households

had a mean household size of 7.3 (sd 3.7). Diarrhoea within

the previous two weeks at baseline was 6.4% [95%CI,

6.0%, 6.9%] of the total study population and 22.1%

[95%CI, 20.2%, 24.0%] of children under five years of

age (Table 1).

While the primary female caretaker in the household

was sought out to participate in the survey, in 49% of

households males were the respondents following house
hold refusal to allow females to participate. The study

population was primarily long-time residents; 97% of

households had lived in the village before 2002. School

had been attended by 36% of males and 7% of females

interviewed. Water was treated by 7% of households, with

boiling the most common method. Less than 1% of

households treated water with Clorin prior to study

interventions.

Reported use of soap for washing the body was

protective against diarrhoea for children under five (OR

[95% CI] ¼ 0.77 [0.60, 0.98], p ¼ 0.03) as was washing


hands with soap located in or near the kitchen/food

preparation area protective for children under five (OR

[95% CI] ¼ 0.58 [034, 1.00], p ¼ 0.05). Washing hands in

the food preparation area also statistically decreased the

likelihood of diarrhoea prevalence in the total population

(OR [95% CI] ¼ 0.66 [0.44, 0.99], p ¼ 0.04); however only

6% of the households were observed to have hand washing

provisions available in or near the kitchen. Soap was

reported as available for hand washing by 77% of house
holds while 55% were actually observed to have soap

readily available. Additionally, 62% of households

reported hand washing facilities near their latrines but

only 25% were observed to have hand washing facilities

present near latrines.

Unprotected hand-dug wells were used by 35% of

households as their primary water source at baseline.

On average, households collected 25.5 litres of water/person/

day, with approximately 31 minutes needed for collection.

Local key informants stated that persons over age 12 use

approximately 5 litres of water/day for ablutions as part of

religious practices.

Eighty per cent of the households had latrines and half

of these were shared with one or more other households.

Of the latrines, 23% had faecal matter outside of contain
ment areas and open defecation was in evidence outside

compound walls throughout the study area. Faecal material

was often observed draining from the back of latrines into

pathways or open ground. Analysis of baseline data showed

an increase in the odds of diarrhoea for those under five

(OR [95% CI] ¼ 1.60 [1.14, 2.22], p, 0.01) and the total

population (OR [95% CI] ¼ 1.64 [1.16, 2.32], p, 0.01) for

households with a latrine.

Follow-up data

At follow-up, approximately 10% of the study households

could not be located, primarily because of migration and the

combining of households. Comparative analyses were

performed with 1,514 households surveyed at baseline and

the subset of 1,359 households found at follow-up to

determine whether a systematic bias occurred among

households lost to follow-up. Proportions of responses to

the baseline survey were generally found to be less than 5%

different with no systematic bias detected.

The follow-up survey population showed a two-week

diarrhoea prevalence in children under five of 25.0% [23.0%,

27.1%]. Although diarrhoea prevalence increased in all age

groups at the time of the follow-up survey, the proportion

of reports with dysentery decreased at the follow-up.

The group of villages receiving the ‘All’ intervention was

the only group that was found to have lower diarrhoea


prevalence in the follow-up compared with the baseline.

This was for both children less than five years of age and the

total population (Figures 4 and 5).

Changes in self-reported water and hygiene-related

behaviours were also examined. Across the total study

population, 7% of households reported treating water

baseline to follow-up with households reporting the

following proportional usage: 82% in ‘Clorin’ group; 78%

in ‘All’ group; 11% in ‘Wells’ group; 4% in ‘Hygiene’ group

and 5% in ‘Control’. Among only those households that

reported treating water in the past two weeks, Clorin was

the method of treatment for the following proportion of

households: 99% of the ‘Clorin’ group; 98% of the ‘All’

group; 76% of the ‘Wells’ group; 52% of the ‘Hygiene’ group

and 47% of the ‘Control’ group. Chlorine residuals were not

checked during surveys so these results were not confirmed.

Protected tubewells were utilized as the principal source


Variables chosen for the multilevel model were those

that were significantly associated with diarrhoea prevalence

in the univariate analyses, including: economic status

measured by the household asset score; age of person

interviewed; whether the principal wife was interviewed or

not; total household size; education level of the principal

female (some versus none); education level of the principal

male (some versus none); presence of a latrine for house
hold use; and usual hand washing practices in the kitchen


or food preparation area (yes versus no).

The ‘All’ group was the only intervention group to show


of water in 34.7% of ‘Wells’ households and 47.1% of ‘All’

households at follow-up, increasing from baseline values of

7.6 and 2.2%, respectively. Sub-analysis of those villages

receiving adequate tubewell coverage (i.e. excluding inter
vention villages where new tubewells were unable to be

completed as intended) showed utilization of protected

tubewells increased to 41.2% in the ‘Wells’ group and 56.5%

in the ‘All’ group. Protected tubewell use also increased

from 2.5 to 11.8% in the ‘Clorin’ group, 3.2 to 31.5% in the

‘Hygiene’ group and 6.8 to 25.3% in ‘Control’ households.


Hygiene households showed an increase in self
reported use of soap for hand washing in the last 24 hours

from 37.9 to 80.9%, while self-reported hand washing

facility availability in the kitchen rose from 9.8 to 17.2%.

Behaviours which did not improve after the ‘Hygiene’

intervention included observed facilities for hand washing

availability near the latrine, which decreased from 31.7% at

baseline to 2.1% at the follow-up, and the proportion of

households observed with faecal matter outside the latrine

Clorin group, when compared with households in the least

poor group (Table 3). In this group the children under five

in the poorest households had slightly lower diarrhoea

largest in the ‘All’ group. The largest diarrhoeal disease

prevalence differential between the poorest and least poor

Disease surveillance results

Prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases in children under five

fluctuated seasonally over the 16 month surveillance period,

with clear peaks during each summer from June through

September (Figure 6). Analyses of diarrhoeal diseases

incidence from the surveillance data focuses on the four
month period from June through September 2006 when

all interventions were in place to the extent possible.

A reduction in the weekly diarrhoeal disease incidence in

children less than five years of age during the four-month

period was not significant in the ‘All’ group when compared

at baseline that 22.1% of children under age five had

experienced diarrhoea in the previous two weeks under
scores the threat of diarrhoea to the health of young

children in Afghanistan. The study’s strongest conclusion is

that, in poorly developed countries such as Afghanistan, no

single intervention is adequate to interrupt diarrhoea

occurrence in rural households. Programmes that seek to

substantially reduce childhood diarrhoea should consider

an integrated interventions approach.


their villages to collect water from new wells in other study

villages. This behaviour could account for the increase in

the use of improved tubewells across all study groups

thereby affecting comparisons between the groups.


It is likely that improved well water was contaminated

at the time of collection through transport and storage

vessels and introduction of microbial agents by unwashed

hands and dirty utensils, as has been documented in other

studies (Roberts et al. 2001; Jensen et al. 2002; Luby et al.

2004). Also, households assigned to study groups not

receiving new tubewells may have travelled outside of


The results from hygiene education alone demonstrated

varying conclusions between the surveillance and survey

data. The twice-weekly surveillance data provides evidence

that hygiene education had an impact on the diarrhoeal

disease incidence rates when all ages are considered.

However, responses during the cross-sectional surveys

conducted one year apart suggested an inconsistent uptake


of the hygiene messages.

Clorin alone did not consistently lead to reductions in

diarrhoea. This finding is similar to results of an earlier

study in Zambia that found that inconsistent household

use diminished Clorin’s overall effectiveness (Olembo &

Burnham 2004). In study villages, Clorin was found to be

widely accepted among households and its effectiveness

was not affected by low economic status. Additionally, there

is evidence that suggests that Clorin use spread across the

study area after the interventions began. This behaviour

may have been impacted by ongoing marketing of Clorin

as well as improved water vessels that occurred in the

study region through summer radio campaigns and

posters in local bazaars. However, Clorin’s effectiveness

may have been compromised by the use of turbid water.

Household filtration, through cloth or other means, prior

to the addition of Clorin may have improved outcomes

(WHO 2002). In addition, there were some temporary

quality control problems with Afghanistan-produced

Clorin; however it is not thought that this problem persisted

long enough to affect study outcomes.

Assessment of latrines found that few were located,

constructed or maintained in a way that would limit

environmental contamination. There was a suggestion

from the study data (not shown) that the presence of a tradi
tional elevated vault latrine in the household compound

increased risk of diarrhoea among household members.

When households were classified by assets, as a proxy

for wealth status, there was a substantial difference in

diarrhoeal rates among children. This is particularly

evident in the ‘All’ intervention households where children

in the poorest households were more than twice as likely

to have diarrhoea during the previous two weeks than

children in the least poor households. While it is possible

that better off households take up change more readily, it

could also be that these households are located closer to

improved water sources, and that they are more able to

purchase adequate amounts of soap and other hygiene

supplies. The asset scores also indicated that Clorin’s use

and/or effectiveness was not related to household economic

status when provided free of charge. The Control group

showed no difference in the likelihood of diarrhoeal disease

occurrence between households of lower and higher

economic status.

Data from twice weekly household surveillance showed

more reductions in diarrhoea in intervention groups

than the cross-sectional surveys that were separated by

12 months. Although results from both the cross-sectional

surveys and the twice-weekly household surveillance visits

give similar results, there were some inconsistencies.

In places like rural Afghanistan with considerable seasonal

and year-to-year fluctuations in diarrhoea prevalence,

surveillance data, though a more demanding approach, is

probably better suited to determine differences in events

that are likely to fluctuate substantially. Further, it offers

the chance to capture day-to-day contextual factors from the

community which may not be detected by a cross-sectional

study. The use of community health workers with their

training and experience in working with communities

offers further strengths to this type of community

surveillance system.


Samples of source and household water supplies were

analysed in existing Kabul labs but are not reported here

because of the elevated error rates between 10 and 20%

found during quality control procedures. Also, periods of

instability limited the completion of water sample collec
tion. However, water samples taken during the summer of

2005 support the conclusion of broad microbial contami
nation of both unprotected source water and household

water supplies.

The delays in installing wells point to difficulties in

extending well drilling programmes in countries such as

Afghanistan where more remote, insecure and/or water

scarce regions are often underserved. Well drilling pro
grammes tend to focus on accessible and secure areas

where water tables are close to the surface and wells can be

sunk with simple percussion equipment (DACAAR 2005).

The sampling frame for this study was largely made up of

villages that had been bypassed in earlier well-drilling

programmes. The study demonstrated that alternative

approaches to improved water are required for some

villages where percussion or even drilled wells are not an

option. Additionally, even in a rural subsistence economy,

household economic differentials may significantly affect

programme outcomes.

An important lesson from this study is that field

research is often possible in insecure settings, providing

flexibility is incorporated into study design and analysis

methods. Fragile states, especially those recovering

from conflict, are in particular need of an evidence base

for developing new policy and practice for national

reconstruction.

Limitations

There were a number of potential limitations in this study.

Recall of bouts of diarrhoea could affect findings from both

survey and surveillance methods although recall is less

likely to be a concern with twice-weekly data collection.

However, adults may be less willing to reveal information

about their own cases of diarrhoea and more likely to

discuss children’s cases. Insecurity and adverse weather

conditions prevented Kabul-based staff from travelling to

the field on a number of occasions, thereby limiting the

ability to consistently monitor surveillance data collection.


-----

700 M. C. Opryszko et al. | Water and hygiene interventions: Afghanistan Journal of Water and Health | 08.4 | 2010


Community health workers proved to be very effective data

collectors, able to continue their work even as insurgents

threatened the region. However, it was not possible to

monitor their work as closely as planned.

Another limitation of the surveillance study is that

person-time, used as the denominator for incidence rate

calculations, was not observed perfectly and had to be

estimated at the village level. Therefore, no adjustments for

household level covariates were made, and all calculations

were done using raw, unadjusted data. Additionally,

intervention groups consisting of randomly assigned villages

may have been significantly different prior to the interven
tions, which was not accounted for in the disease

surveillance data analyses.

The different timing of intervention commencement

may have affected an intervention’s overall effectiveness,

especially in the hygiene group. While hygiene educators

visited households twice in the summer of 2005, the data

analysis was primarily based on disease rates occurring

between May 2006 and September 2006. It is possible that

the hygiene group’s peak effect may not have been

measured owing to the lag time between the intervention

and data collection periods.

Also, the intent of the study was to solicit household

information from the principal female caregiver of a

household, but approximately half of the time females

were not permitted to give information or were unavailable.

In most cases where the principal female was not

interviewed, the male head of household provided

responses. It is possible that information provided by

females other than the principal female or males about

diarrhoea occurrence in household members and children

was not accurate.

The planned interventions could not be fully

implemented in five villages for technical reasons, and

this may have affected outcomes. For children under

five, sensitivity analyses of surveillance data showed no

change in our conclusions when data from these villages

were excluded from the analyses. However, when diarrhoea

among all household members was examined, excluding

the five villages with incomplete implementation of

interventions, Clorin as well as the other interventions

was demonstrated to significantly decrease incidence

of diarrhoea.


### CONCLUSION

By comparing the effectiveness of interventions to reduce

diarrhoea, this study found that substantial reductions in

diarrhoeal disease rates in rural Afghanistan would best be

obtained through multiple barrier methods incorporating

tubewells, hygiene education and Clorin. The study

also supports previous studies that found that hygiene

education provided through direct and repeated contact

with household members using targeted messages deliv
ered by trained educators will reduce diarrhoeal disease

rates. Tubewells were also shown to be important inter
ventions for the reduction of diarrhoea but will require

more sophisticated equipment, such as rotary drilling rigs,

to construct new wells in more challenging mountainous

regions. The addition of Clorin to the other interventions

may pose a financial barrier to rural households, even at

its subsidized price, as it was perceived to be too

expensive. Households in the lower economic strata need

to be targeted specifically as they carry more burden of

diarrhoeal disease, and are least able to adapt to new

interventions. Finally, the issues of improving design and

use of effective latrines along with behaviour change

interventions are critical, as it is likely that the current

high rates of diarrhoea in Afghanistan may be very much

influenced by faecal contamination from the commonly

found elevated vault latrine.
