Abstract

A ‘non-blind’ randomized hand washing intervention study was conducted in a low socioeconomic
community in Rangoon to determine if hand washing
by 494 children under 5 years old and their mothers
could reduce the incidence of diarrhoea and dysentery
in these children. Children and mothers in the
intervention group were asked to wash their hands
after defaecation and before preparing or eating their
3 main meals; 2 bars of plain soap were provided. The
control group was left to follow customary practice.
Diarrhoea and dysentery incidences in the 2 groups
were monitored during 4 months by comparing the
incidence density ratios (IDR). The diarrhoeal incidence among the children in the hand washing
households was significantly lower than that among
those in the control households (IDR = 0.70, 95%
confidence interval (CI) = O-54-0.92). For dysentery
incidence, although there was a 40% reduction
(IDR = O-58, 95% CI = 0.22-1-55) in the children
under 2 years, there seemed to be no impact in older
children (IDR = 1.2. 95% CI = 0.52-2-80). The
study indicates that ‘hand washing is effec’tive in
reducing the morbidity from diarrhoea and dysentery.

Introduction
Transmission of diarrhoeal pathogens from faeces
to susceptible host involves many pathways, of which
hands are one. Dirty, contaminated hands can act as
mechanical carriers for the aetiologic agents to the
susceptible host directly or indirectly through food
and water or through household contamination
(SAMADI et al., 1983.; AUNG MYO HAN et al., 1986).
A number of stuQes have shown that proper hand
washing with soap is effective in reducing acute
diarrhoea and dvsenterv. These studies have been
carried out either to determine the impact on diarrhoea alone in closed institutions where compliance
can easily be monitored (BLACK et al., 1981) or to
prevent the secondary transmission of dysentery
within families (KHAN, 1982).

We are not aware of any study examining the
impact of proper hand washing on both diarrhoea and
dysentery in a community setting, taking care to
monitor objectively the compliance of the intervention group. Very few people in Burma practise hand
washing with soap and water after defaecation or
before eating or handling food (AUNG MYO HAN 81
THEIN MAUNG MYINT, 1986). Therefore, this study
was conducted to determine if proper hand washing
by children and their mothers with plain bar soap
after defaecation and before preparing and eating 3
main meals could reduce the incidence of acute
diarrhoea and dysentery in the children.

November 1985 in a low socioeconomic grade community (Nga-Kha ward of Thin-Gun-Kyun township)
in Rangoon. During June 1985, household screening
(for inclusion in the study) was done in each
contiguous electoral unit in the comrmmity, starting
with electoral unit 1, until the required sample was
obtained.
The required sample size of 400 children was
determined by using the sample size formula for the
detection of difference between 2 proportions
(ABRAMSON & PERITZ, 1983) and us& the mean
diarrhoeal incidence rate of 0.2877 enisode/child/

Households selected were those which had one or
more children between 6 and 59 months old, those in
which the mothers gave their informed consent, those
in which regular follow-up was possible and those in
which the mothers and children were not allergic to
soap. The mothers of children admitted to the study
were informed of the mu-nose and procedures and
informed consent and demographic data were
obtained. 350 mothers and 494 children in 350
households were selected for study. Of the children,
only 12 (7 from intervention and 5 from control
households) moved out of the community before the
end of the study.
Base-line surveillance and intewention

After one month (July) of monitoring diarrhoea and
dysentery incidence to obtain base-line data, the
participating households were randomly allocated to
intervention and control groups. The mothers and
children in the intervention group were asked to wash
their hands after defaecation and before preparing or
eating their 3 main meals (early morning, late
morning and evening). Two bars of weighed plain
soap in 2 empty condensed milk tins were provided,
one for use after defaecation and the other before food
preparation or eating. The soap was replenished as
necessary every 2 weeks during surprise random visits
to monitor compliance. No hand washing intervention was given to the control group.

Outcome assessment and compliance monitoring
Daily surveillance (24 h recall) for diarrhoea and
dysentery incidence was made from July to November
1985 by 6 trained community health workers
(CHWs). The reliability of their surveillance data was
independently monitored each week by random
unannounced visits, during which staff from the

values and percentage agreement were calculated
(FLEISS, 1981) and assessed. The median kappa
values and the percentage agreement between these
observers ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 and 97.7 to 98.5
respectively.
Compliance with the intervention procedure was
maintained by daily checks and reminders on soap
usage by the CHWs, by establishing close contacts
with subjects and reinforcing the intervention procedure, and by checking the soap usage by weighing the
distributed soap (with an electronic balance) during
random visits.
The operational definitions of acute diarrhoea and
dysentery used were those described by NEWELL
(1965) and WOODRUFF & BELL (1978) respectively. If
7 or more days separated 2 attacks of diarrhoea or
dysentery, they were considered as 2 separate episodes.

Statistical anatjks

The base-line variables in the hand washing households (HWH) and control households (CH) were
compared using the differences between 2 means or
proportions as appropriate. For the ordinal data, the
median test was used. A large sample Z test for the
incidence density differences (IDD) was used for the
base-line diarrhoeal and dysentery incidence. Comparison of outcome variables in the 2 groups was made
by using the incidence density ratio (IDR) (KLEINBAUM et al., 1982). IDD and IDR were calculated on


129

an HP41CV calculator using the program for comparison of rates (incidence density data) of ABRAMSON
& PERIT (1983).
Results
Comparability of hand washing and control households
236 chiklren (162 households) were allocated to the
intervention group and 258 (188) to the control group.
The groups were comparable concerning almost all
the important variables (Table 1). Although the
base-line diarrhoea and dysentery incidences in the
control group were slightly higher than those in the
hand washing group, the IDDs were not statistically
sign&ant (Z = -0.41 and - 1.65 respectively).

Impact of hand washing on the incidence of diawhoea and
dYSentety
The impact of hand washing on the incidence of
diarrhoea and dysentery among the children is given
in Table 2. The diarrhoeal incidence for all children in
the HWH was significantly lower than that for those
in the CH (IDR = 0.70, 95% confidence interval
(CI) = 0-54-0-92). Similarly, the incidences for the 2
age groups (~2 and 32 years) in the HWH were
significantly lower than those in the CH
(IDR = 0.69,95% CI = O-48-1.01 and IDR = 0.67,

Discussion
The risk of diarrhoeal pathogens spreading from
cases or carriers to susceptible children within families or day-care centres is increased by poor hygienic
practices (AUNG MYO HAN et al., 1986; BLACK et al.,

1977). To interrupt this transmission, proper hand
washing with soap and water has been shown to be
effective (BLACK et al., 1981; KHAN, 1982; TORUM,
1982; STANTON & CLEMENS, 1987). Our study also
found that hand washing intervention was effective in
reducing the incidence of diarrhoea. The diarrhoeal
incidence rates were significantly reduced in the
HWH and the percentage reductions were within the
range found in other studies (PEACHEM, 1984).
However, although our data suggest that the
intervention was also effective against dysentery
incidence in children less than 2 years old, it seemed
not to be so for older children. A number of reasons
can be given for this.
(i) Inadequate sample size may result in failure to
obtain a statistically significant reduction. The sample
size was based on diarrhoeal incidence rates only and
not on dysentery incidence. We estimated the study
power (ABRAMSON & PERITZ, 1983) using the
observed dysentery incidence and found that with the
number of children below 2 years in the study (171),
and at an alpha level of O-05, the study had a power of
only 54% to detect the difference.
(ii) As our intervention focused on washing hands

between meals may not have been affected. Children
older than 2 years who are ambulatory usually have
more contact with contaminated enviromnent outside
their houses and also more person-to-person contacts
with other children during play. It is likely that our
intervention was unable to prevent dysentery transmission during such contacts.
However, the failure to find an impact was probably not due to inadequacy in the conduct of the
intervention, to the parallel occurrence of hand
washing in the control group, or to major compliance
failure because, if these effects were operating, we
would not have found any reduction in diarrhoeal
incidence. Our findings are corroborated by a similar
study in another community in Kangoon (Ohn Kyi,
unpublished data).
Our study was not conducted ‘blind because it was
difficult to maintain ‘double-blindness’ without more
money and personnel. But we attempted to avoid bias
by employing our permanent staff, who did not know
which households were on intervention, to assess the
outcome variables independently and compare their
data with those of the CHWs. We found reasonably
high kappa values and percentage agreement between
these two categories of workers. Furthermore,
another argument against bias was the lack of an
intervention effect on dysentery rates in children
older than 2 years. If bias in favour of intervention
had operated, this would not have occurred.
Poor compliance with the intervention might also
affect the studv. However, this was subiectivelv and
objectively assessed as minimal throughout the study.
Bias could also occur from differential migration in
the hand washing and control groups, but this was not
so because onlv 3% and 2% from the HWH and CH,
respectively, migrated during the study period.
Hand washine intervention in Burmese homes is
effective in redu&g diarrhoea and dysentery morbidity. But for a long lasting positive behaviour change to
occur, sustained and culturally appropriate health
education programmes need to be implemented
(FEACHEM, 1984). Similarly, in parallel with these
educational programmes, soap must be made cheaply
and readily available.
