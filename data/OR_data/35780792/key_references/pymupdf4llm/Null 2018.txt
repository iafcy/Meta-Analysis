### Summary
**Background Poor nutrition and exposure to faecal contamination are associated with diarrhoea and growth faltering,**
**both of which have long-term consequences for child health. We aimed to assess whether water, sanitation,**
**handwashing, and nutrition interventions reduced diarrhoea or growth faltering.**

**Methods The WASH Benefits cluster-randomised trial enrolled pregnant women from villages in rural Kenya and**
**evaluated outcomes at 1 year and 2 years of follow-up. Geographically-adjacent clusters were block-randomised to**
**active control (household visits to measure mid-upper-arm circumference), passive control (data collection only), or**
**compound-level interventions including household visits to promote target behaviours: drinking chlorinated water**
**(water); safe sanitation consisting of disposing faeces in an improved latrine (sanitation); handwashing with soap**
**(handwashing); combined water, sanitation, and handwashing; counselling on appropriate maternal, infant, and**
**young child feeding plus small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements from 6–24 months (nutrition); and**
**combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition. Primary outcomes were caregiver-reported diarrhoea in the**
**past 7 days and length-for-age Z** **score at year 2 in index children born to the enrolled pregnant women. Masking was**
**not possible for data collection, but analyses were masked. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered**
**with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01704105.**

**Findings Between Nov 27, 2012, and May 21, 2014, 8246 women in 702 clusters were enrolled and randomly assigned**
**an intervention or control group. 1919 women were assigned to the active control group; 938 to passive control; 904 to**
**water; 892 to sanitation; 917 to handwashing; 912 to combined water, sanitation, and handwashing; 843 to nutrition;**
**and 921 to combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition. Data on diarrhoea at year 1 or year 2 were available**
**for 6494 children and data on length-for-age Z** **score in year 2 were available for 6583 children (86% of living children**
**were measured at year 2). Adherence indicators for sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition were more than 70% at**
**year 1, handwashing fell to less than 25% at year 2, and for water was less than 45% at year 1 and less than 25% at**
**year 2; combined groups were comparable to single groups. None of the interventions reduced diarrhoea prevalence**
**compared with the active control. Compared with active control (length-for-age Z** **score –1·54) children in nutrition**
**and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition were taller by year 2 (mean difference 0·13 [95% CI**
**0·01–0·25] in the nutrition group; 0·16 [0·05–0·27] in the combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition**
**group). The individual water, sanitation, and handwashing groups, and combined water, sanitation, and handwashing**
**group had no effect on linear growth.**

**Interpretation** **Behaviour change messaging combined with technologically simple interventions such as water**
**treatment, household sanitation upgrades from unimproved to improved latrines, and handwashing stations did not**
**reduce childhood diarrhoea or improve growth, even when adherence was at least as high as has been achieved by other**
**programmes. Counselling and supplementation in the nutrition group and combined water, sanitation, handwashing,**
**and nutrition interventions led to small growth benefits, but there was no advantage to integrating water, sanitation, and**
**handwashing with nutrition. The interventions might have been more efficacious with higher adherence or in an**
**environment with lower baseline sanitation coverage, especially in this context of high diarrhoea prevalence.**

### Introduction
An estimated 156 million children worldwide suffer from
stunting (linear growth faltering) and are unlikely to
reach their full potential as adults [1] Linear growth faltering


is the most apparent sign of chronic undernutrition and
is the physical manifestation of combined physiological
and developmental insults. Early-life stunting leads to
poor cognitive development in childhood reduced

economic productivity in adulthood, and increased risk of
morbidity and mortality.[2,3] Because nutrient supple­
mentation and counselling interventions for maternal,
infant, and young child feeding have been only marginally
successful at preventing growth faltering, exposure to
faecal contamination in the environment has recently
been hypothesised to lead to environmental enteric
dysfunction, which features chronic immune stimulation
and impaired nutrient absorption, thereby constraining a
growth response to improved nutrition.[4] In addition to
the detrimental effects on growth and development,
under­nutrition was estimated to cause 45% of all
child deaths in 2011, and it has long been recognised
that undernutrition is an important determinant of
susceptibility to infectious disease.[5,6] Diarrhoea is the
second leading cause of death in children aged
1–59 months, contributing to almost 500 000 deaths in
children younger than 5 years in 2015.[7] Frequent diarrhoea
is also associated with linear growth faltering.[8] If there is
a pathway independent of symptomatic diarrhoea linking
environmental contamination to growth faltering, the
benefits of improving water safety, sanitation, and
handwashing could be underestimated because studies
have generally focused on diarrhoea. It is unclear whether
combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional
interventions reduce diarrhoea or improve growth more
than single interventions


**Research in context**

**Evidence before this study**
Malnutrition and enteric infection are thought to act together
to impair child health and survival, yet there is limited evidence
of low cost, scalable interventions effective at breaking this
cycle. A 2008 meta-analysis by Dewey and Adu-Afarwuah
found that interventions offering nutrient supplementation or
counselling on complementary feeding could result in modest
improvements to child growth. Another meta-analysis by
Waddington and Snilsveit in 2009 showed that water
treatment or handwashing could prevent diarrhoea, but there
had not been any randomised trials of the effect of sanitation
on diarrhoea. During this study, five other randomised trials of
the effects of sanitation on diarrhoea and growth were
published, but three were limited by low adherence. Whether
combining water, sanitation, handwashing, or nutrition
interventions could result in added benefits for health and
growth was not known.

**Added value of this study**
This trial is one of the first to provide experimental evidence on
whether individual and combined water, sanitation, or
handwashing interventions improve growth; combined water,
sanitation, and handwashing interventions are more effective
at reducing diarrhoea and growth faltering than any
intervention alone; and nutrition counselling and
supplementation are more effective when combined with


improved water, sanitation, and handwashing. This is the first
rigorous evaluation of upgrading from unimproved to
improved latrines in sub-Saharan Africa. None of the
interventions reduced diarrhoea, and only the interventions
that included nutrition counselling and nutrient
supplementation improved growth.

**Implications of all the available evidence**
Our results on growth effects are consistent with those from
previous research on the combination of nutrition counselling
and nutrient supplementation, finding modest effects on linear
growth. It is possible that more intensive promotion and higher
adherence would have resulted in larger effects, especially in this
context of high diarrhoea prevalence, but few programmes are
likely to be able to afford sustaining a more ambitious behaviour
change programme than was included in this trial. In a context
where most households already had an unimproved sanitation
facility, provision of technologically simple interventions
including chlorination for household treatment of drinking water,
improved pit latrines, and handwashing stations—standard for
most WASH programmes in rural areas of low-income countries—
might not be sufficient to improve growth. By contrast with
previous studies, this trial provided evidence that technologically
simple water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions with
adherence rates at least as high as most programmes achieve
might not reduce childhood diarrhoea in all situations.


We aimed to investigate whether individual water,
sanitation, handwashing, or nutrition interventions can
reduce linear growth faltering; to assess whether
combined water, sanitation, and handwashing inter­
ventions are more effective at reducing diarrhoea than
individual interventions; and to investigate whether the
combination of water, sanitation, handwashing, and
nutrition inter­ventions reduces growth faltering more
than each individual intervention. A companion trial[9] in
Bangladesh evaluated the same objectives.

### Methods
#### Study design
The Kenya WASH Benefits study was a clusterrandomised trial done in rural villages in Bungoma,
Kakamega, and Vihiga counties in Kenya’s western region
(appendix p 11). We used a cluster design to facilitate the
logistics of the behaviour change component of the
interventions and minimise contamination between
intervention and comparison households. We hypo­
thesised that the interventions would improve the health
of the index child in each household. We optimised the
trial design to measure group-level differences in primary
outcomes by including a large number of clusters, each
comprising relatively few children (12 on average) with
infrequent measurement. Each measurement round
lasted roughly 1 year and was balanced across treatment


-----

groups and geography to minimise seasonal or geo­
graphic confounding when comparing outcomes across
groups.
With active and passive control groups and six
intervention groups (water; sanitation; handwashing;
combined water, sanitation, and handwashing; nutrition;
and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and
nutrition), the design enabled 11 comparisons of each
intervention group with the active control; combined
water, sanitation, and handwashing with each intervention
alone; and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and
nutrition with nutrition alone, and combined water,
sanitation, and handwashing. A double-sized active control
group was used to increase power because there were six
separate intervention comparisons against control.[10]
Households in the active control and all intervention
groups were visited by community-based health promoters
monthly to measure the child’s mid-upper arm
circumference. Health promoters did not visit households
in passive control clusters. Measurement of outcomes, as
well as water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition
characteristics were measured in the passive control group
at the same times as in other groups. The study design and
rationale have been published previously.[10]

The study protocol was approved by the Committee for
the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of
California, Berkeley (protocol number 2011-09-3654), the
institutional review board at Stanford University
(IRB-23310), and the scientific and ethics review unit at
the Kenya Medical Research Institute (protocol number
SSC-2271). Under direction of the study investigators,
Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) was responsible for
intervention delivery and data collection.

#### Participants
Villages were eligible for selection into the study if they
were rural, most of the population relied on communal
water sources and had unimproved sanitation facilities,
and there were no other ongoing water, sanitation,
handwashing, or nutrition programmes. Participants
were identified through a complete census of eligible
villages. Within selected villages, women were eligible to
participate if they reported that they were in their second
or third trimester of pregnancy, planned to continue to
live at their current residence for the next 2 years, and
could speak Kiswahili, Luhya, or English well enough to
respond to an interviewer administered survey. IPA staff
formed clusters from one to three neighbouring villages
to have six or more pregnant women per cluster after the
enrolment survey. Outcomes were assessed in the
children born from these pregnancies (index children),
including twins. Although the study area is one of the
areas with the highest HIV prevalence in Kenya,
according to the 2012 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey, the
prevalence in women aged 15–64 years in the study area
was below 6% (that survey did not include testing of
children) Because there would not have been sufficient


sample size to allow for subgroup analysis by HIV status,
no attempt was made to identify participants who were
HIV positive. Participants gave written informed consent
before enrolment.

#### Randomisation and masking
Clusters were randomly allocated to treatment using a
random number generator with reproducible seed at
the University of California, Berkeley. Groups of nine
geographically-adjacent clusters were block-randomised
into a double-sized active control; passive control; water;
sanitation; handwashing; water, sanitation, and hand­
washing; nutrition; or water, sanitation, handwashing,
and nutrition. Allocation by cluster identification number
was communicated directly to the field team; investigators
remained blinded to treatment assignments. Blinding of
participants was not possible. Participants were informed
of their treatment assignment after baseline data
collection and might have known the treatment
assignment of nearby villages. The health promoters and
staff who delivered the interventions were not involved in
data collection, but the data collection team could have
inferred treatment status if they saw intervention
materials in study communities.

#### Procedures
The interventions were designed to maximise adherence
to behaviours that could protect children from exposure to
pathogens in their environment and improve diet quality.
Formative research in the study area concluded that the
health benefits of target behaviours were already well
understood, but this knowledge was not sufficient to lead
to action. As such, the behaviour change strategy and
intervention materials were selected to create enabling
environments, build supportive social norms, and target
emotional drivers of decision making. The messages and
delivery modes for the behaviour change strategy drew
from existing information, education, and communication
materials from organisations such as WHO, the Kenyan
Government, UNICEF, and the Alive and Thrive network,
and extensive previous qualitative work on the drivers
of handwashing behaviours. Monthly visit modules
were developed and pilot-tested to provide behavioural
recommendations to mothers and other caregivers using
key thematic constructs of convenience, nurturing care,
and aspiration. We did a pilot randomised controlled trial[11]
to test the feasibility and acceptability of all the interventions
and to collect data that allowed us to optimise the ratio of
community-based promoters to study participants. To
identify and correct systematic problems with adherence,
staff confirmed that intervention materials were delivered
to all study participants at the outset of the trial, and
collected monitoring data on availability of interv­
ention materials and recommended behaviours during
unannounced visits to a random sample of at least 20% of
participants in intervention groups 2, 6, 10, and 19 months
after the interventions began

a dispenser. Promoters used chlorine test strips during
their regular visits to determine if the household was
using chlorine, and negative results stimulated
conversation about addressing barriers to chlorination.
In the three intervention groups that included
sanitation, promoters advocated using latrines for
defecation and safe disposal of children’s and animals’
faeces into a latrine. Existing unimproved latrines in
study households were upgraded to improved latrines by
installing a plastic slab, which also had a tight-fitting lid
over the hole. New latrines were constructed for study
households that did not have a latrine or whose latrine
was unlikely to last for 2 years. All households in study
compounds received a sani-scoop with a paddle as a
dedicated faeces-removal tool. Finally, all households
with children younger than 3 years in study compounds
received plastic potties to facilitate toilet training and
transfer of child faeces to the latrine.
In the three intervention groups that included
handwashing, promoters advocated handwashing with
soap before handling food and after defecation
(including assisting a child). Study compounds were
given two permanent, water-frugal handwashing stations
intended to be installed near the food preparation area
and the latrine. Handwashing stations were constructed
of painted metal, with two foot-pedal-operated jerry-cans
that dispensed a light flow of rinse water and soapy
water. Promoters added chunks of bar soap to the soapy
water container quarterly.
In the two intervention groups that included nutrition, a
set of ten age-targeted modules were developed to enable
promoters to advocate for best practices in maternal,
infant, and young child feeding: recommend­ations for
dietary diversity during pregnancy and lactation, early
initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding until
6 months, introduction of appropriate and diverse
complementary foods at 6 months, and continued
breastfeeding through 24 months. Facilitators and barriers
to behaviour change were elicited using formative
research and health promoter guides were developed to
address common barriers and questions. Study mothers
with children between 6–24 months were provided with
two 10 g sachets per day of a small quantity of lipid-based
nutrient supplement (LNS; Nutriset; Malauny, France)
that could be mixed into the child’s food. LNS provided
118 kcal per day and 12 essential vitamins and ten minerals.
Promoters explained that LNS was not to replace
breastfeeding or comple­mentary foods.
Promoters and intervention materials were introduced
at community meetings roughly 6 weeks after enrolment.
All interventions were delivered within 3 months of
enrolment (appendix p 1). LNS was introduced to each
child when they turned 6 months old. All handwashing
stations and latrines were inspected within a month of
construction, and a subset of households was periodically
visited to observe group-specific indicators of intervention
adherence These data alerted study investigators to any

Community-based promoters for intervention and
active control groups were nominated by study mothers
and other mothers of children younger than 3 years in the
community. A second promoter was added if there were
more than ten participants (single groups) or more than
eight participants (combined groups) in the cluster, giving
a total of 1031 promoters. Promoters attended 2 days
(active control), 6 days (single groups), or 7 days (combined
groups) of initial training led by study staff on how to
measure mid-upper-arm circumference, communication
skills, intervention-specific behaviour change messages
and intervention materials, and the information they were
expected to report to IPA. Refresher trainings were done
6, 12, and 18 months after the initial training. At 2, 4, 9, 15,
and 21 months, study staff met with promoters in their
clusters to observe visits and offer supportive supervision.
Study staff called promoters monthly to collect information
on their activities, intervention adherence in the
households they visited, referrals to health centres, and
births or deaths of study children. Promoters received a
branded T-shirt, a mobile phone, job aids and intervention
materials, and compensation of approximately US$15 per
month for the first 6 months when they had more
intensive engagement with the study participants, and
$9 per month thereafter (the prevailing daily wage for
unskilled labour in the study area is $1–2). Promoters
were instructed to visit all participants in their cluster
monthly and measure the child’s arm circumference or
the pregnant mother’s abdomen.
In intervention groups, promoters engaged study
participants and other compound members through
interactive activities such as guided discussions using
visual aids, song, and storytelling; resupplied consumable
intervention materials; encouraged consistent practice of
targeted behaviours; and helped troubleshoot barriers
to adherence, including problems with intervention
hardware and behavioural barriers. Promoters were
provided with detailed plans for every visit, including key
messages, scripts for discussing visual aids, and
instructions for activities that emphasised the learning
objectives. Visits lasted about 10 min in the active control
group and 45–60 min in intervention groups during the
first year when the key messages were conveyed. In the
second year, promoters reinforced messages to maintain
habits. All groups used messages on themes of nurture,
aspiration, and self-efficacy, particularly in the context of
[a new birth. Interventions used convenience and social](https://osf.io/fs23x)
norms to encourage target behaviours.
In the three intervention groups that included water,
promoters advocated treatment of drinking water with
sodium hypochlorite. Chlorine dispensers for convenient
water treatment at the point of collection were installed
at an average of five communal water sources in
the cluster and refilled as needed. Every 6 months,
households in study compounds were given a 1 L bottle
of chlorine for point-of-use water treatment in case
households collected rainwater or used a source without

issues with intervention implementation so they could
be addressed consistently across all clusters and groups.
The enrolment survey included baseline demographics;
assets; water, sanitation, and handwashing infrastructure;
and target behaviours. Follow-up at 1 year and 2 years
after intervention delivery consisted of an unannounced
visit to study compounds to observe objective indicators
of target behaviours (in all groups other than the passive
control) and, on the following day, growth and health
outcome measurements at a central location in the
cluster (eg a church or school)


Children identified as possibly malnourished (midupper-arm circumference <11·5 cm), either by the
promoter during routine visits or by study staff during
follow-up measurements, were referred to health
facilities for treatment.

#### Outcomes
Adherence to the interventions was assessed using
objective, observable indicators where possible (appendix
pp 2, 3). We calculated Z scores for length for age, weight
for length weight for age and head circumference for

ing board.

#### Role of the funding source
The funders of the study approved the study design,
but had no role in data collection, data analysis,
data interpretation, or writing of the report. The
corresponding author had full access to all the data in
the study and had final responsibility for the decision to
submit for publication.

### Results
2569 villages were assessed for eligibility, of which
606 were excluded on the basis of village-level
characteristics (primarily not meeting the study’s rural
criteria). 1226 villages were grouped into 702 clusters that
had six or more pregnant women (figure 1). Between
Nov 27, 2012, and May 21, 2014, 8246 pregnant women
were enrolled in the study. 281 women did not have a
livebirth and 140 women delivered twins. After at least
three attempts to measure each child, 6659 (86%) of
7780 surviving children were measured at year 2, with
diarrhoea reports for 6494 children and length-for-age
_Z score measures for 6583 children. Children were aged_
2–18 months (median 12 months) at 1-year follow-up
(January, 2014, to June, 2015) and aged 16–31 months
(median 25 months) at 2-year follow-up (February, 2015,
to July, 2016), but 11 184 (87%) of 12 841 children were in
the target age ranges of 9–15 months at year 1 and
21–27 months at year 2 (appendix p 12).
Household characteristics were similar across groups
at enrolment (table 1). Roughly three-quarters of partici­
pants collected drinking water from an improved source,
but had to walk at least 10 min on average to the source.
Over 80% of households owned a latrine, but less than
20% had access to an improved latrine. Less than 15% of
households had soap available at a handwashing location.
The prevalence of moderate-to-severe household hunger
was 12% or lower.
Around 75% of households were visited by their promoter
within the past month at year 1, but frequency of contact
fell by year 2, with 40% or fewer households reporting a
visit in the past month in each group (monitoring data
suggest that most households were still visited at least every
other month during the second year of the trial; see details
in the appendix p 2, and table 2). Slightly less than half of
households had detectable free chlorine in stored drinking
water in the water group. Around 40% of drinking water
samples tested in the water, sanitation, handwashing, and
nutrition group had detectable free chlorine at year 1, which
fell to around 20% by year 2. A high proportion of
households (75%) had improved latrine access, which
remained stable in year 1 and year 2 in households in the
sanitation groups, increasing by more than 50% compared
with the active control group. Reported safe disposal of
children’s faeces into a latrine fell by roughly half in all

age using the WHO 2006 child growth standards. All
child deaths reported by the health promoters were
confirmed by a staff nurse who visited households. All
outcomes were prespecified. Primary outcomes were
caregiver-reported diarrhoea in the past 7 days (based on
all data from year 1 and year 2) and length-for-age Z score
at year 2 in index children. Secondary and tertiary
outcomes reported in this paper are length-for-age
_Z score at year 1; weight-for-length Z score, weight-for-age_
_Z score, head circumference-for-age Z score at year 1 and_
year 2; prevalence of stunting (length-for-age Z score less
than –2), severe stunting (length-for-age _Z_ score less
than –3), wasting (weight-for-length Z score less than –2),
and underweight (weight-for-age _Z score less than –2);_
and all-cause mortality. We excluded children from
_Z-score analyses if their measurements were outside_
biologically plausible ranges following WHO
recommendations. More details on exclusion criteria,
measurement protocols, and outcome definitions are in
the appendix (p 1).

#### Statistical analyses
Sample size calculations for the two primary outcomes
were based on a minimum detectable effect of 0·15 in
length-for-age Z score (intracluster correlation of 0·02 in
our pilot study) and a relative risk of diarrhoea of 0·7 or
smaller (assuming a 7-day prevalence of 12% in the active
control group based on a pilot study to inform this trial)
for a comparison of any intervention with the doublesized control group, assuming a type I error (α) of 0·05
and power (1–β) of 0·8, a one-sided test for a two-sample
comparison of means, and 10% loss to follow-up.[10,11]
Sample size calculations indicated 80 clusters per group,
each with ten children.
Two biostatisticians, blinded to treatment assignment,
independently replicated the analyses following the
[prespecified analysis plan with minor updates.[10] We](https://osf.io/7urqa/)
analysed participants according to their randomised
assignment (intention to treat), regardless of adherence
to the intervention, using the active control group
as the comparator. We used paired _t tests for_
unadjusted length-for-age _Z score comparisons and the_
Mantel-Haenszel prevalence ratio and difference for
unadjusted diarrhoea and stunting comparisons, with
randomisation block defining matched pairs or
stratification. In secondary analyses, we estimated
prevalence ratios and differences, adjusting for baseline
covariates using targeted maximum likelihood esti­
mation.[12] Analyses were done in _R (version 3.2.3). We_
tested for the presence of between-cluster spillover
effects using a non-parametric method described in the
prespecified analysis plan, which tested whether primary
outcomes were the same in control households with
more versus fewer households receiving interventions
within a 2 km radius. In an analysis that was not
prespecified, we tested for intervention effects on
diarrhoea using only year 1 data

groups between year 1 and year 2, although the practice
remained over twice as likely in the groups that included
sanitation compared with other groups at year 1 and year 2.
More than 75% of households in the intervention groups
that included handwashing had water and soap available at
a handwashing location at year 1, but this indicator also
fell to about 20% by year 2 Adherence to LNS


recommendations was high (≥95%) at year 1 and year 2,
with children consuming a few more LNS sachets per
month on average than would be expected at year 2. Across
all indicators, adherence was comparable between the
water, sanitation, and handwashing group and the water,
sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition group compared
with single intervention groups


-----

Diarrhoea prevalence over the past 7 days (combining
data from year 1 and year 2) was 27·1% in children in
the active control group (figure 2, table 3). The
intracluster correlation for diarrhoea was 0·012.
Compared with the active control group, the diarrhoea
prevalence ratios across all groups were not signifi­
cantly different from one and differences were not
significantly different from zero (figure 2, table 3).
Diarrhoea prevalence was the same in the combined
water, sanitation, and handwashing group and the
individual water, sanitation, and handwashing groups.
Although adherence to the water and handwashing
interventions was higher in year 1 than in year 2, in an
analysis that was not prespecified, diarrhoea prevalence
was not significantly lower in any of the intervention
groups at year 1 (appendix p 12). The high diarrhoea
prevalence was fairly stable over 2 years of follow-up
and there were no apparent seasonal trends (appendix
p 13). Although we had prespecified a sensitivity analysis
by age group of child at year 2 we did not complete this


analysis because sample sizes in the age group strata
were smaller than expected.
By year 2, when children were between 16 and
31 months old (median 25 months), mean length-for-age
_Z score in children in the active control group was –1·54_
(SD 1·11; figure 3). The intracluster correlation for
length-for-age _Z score was 0·037. Compared with the_
active control group, only nutrition and combined water,
sani­tation, handwashing, and nutrition had higher
length-for-­age _Z score (mean difference in score 0·13_

[95% CI 0·01–0·25] for nutrition; 0·16 [0·05–0·27] for
combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition;
figure 3). Children in the combined water, sanitation,
handwashing, and nutrition group were not significantly
taller than children in the nutrition group (mean
difference 0·04 [95% CI –0·11 to 0·19]; figure 3). Most
length-for-age _Z score gains in these two groups_
were already apparent by year 1 (0·11 [–0·01 to 0·22]
for nutrition; 0·12 [0·01–0·22] for combined water,
sanitation handwashing and nutrition; appendix p 14)

Mean weight-for-age _Z score at year 2 was higher in_
children in the nutrition and combined water, sanitation,
handwashing, and nutrition groups than the mean of
–0·72 (SD 1·01) in the active control group (table 4).
Children in the active control group were close to
WHO standards for weight-for-length _Z score; however,_
weight-for-length _Z score at year 2 was higher in the_
combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition
group (table 4). There were no differences in mean head
circumference for age Z score at year 2 between children
in any of the intervention groups and those in the active
control group. Results were similar at year 1, with the
exception that differences in mean weight-for-length
_Z score between the active control and two groups with_
the nutrition intervention appear to have been numerically
larger at year 1 (appendix p 15).
Compared with the active control group, a smaller
proportion of children in the combined water, sanitation,
handwashing, and nutrition group were stunted (too short
for their age; –5·4 percentage points [95% CI –9·4 to –1·4]),
severely stunted (–2·7 percentage points [–5·1 to –0·2]), or
underweight (–3·0 percentage points [–5·4 to –0·6];
table 5); no other groups appeared to affect these
outcomes. Notably, there were no significant differences
between the combined water, sanitation, handwashing,
and nutrition and nutrition groups for any growth
outcomes. 1% of active control children were wasted and
the proportions were similar across all groups.
Differences in growth outcomes between the active
control and intervention groups were similar in
magnitude and precision when estimated using adjusted
models (appendix pp 16–19). We found no evidence of
between-cluster spillover effects (appendix p 20).
The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was
3·9% in the active control and ranged from 5·3% in the
handwashing group to 2·8% in the combined water


sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition group; none of
the differences between intervention groups and the
active control were statistically significant at α=0·05
(figure 1, appendix p 21).

### Discussion
In the WASH Benefits cluster-randomised controlled
trial we found no effect of any interventions (improved

water quality, safe sanitation, handwashing, nutrition, or
combinations of the interventions) on caregiver-reported
diarrhoea prevalence during the first 2 years of life, and
improvements in growth were only observed in groups
including the nutrition intervention (maternal, infant,
and young child feeding counselling and LNS
distribution). With a large sample size and high-quality
anthropometric measurements, this trial was powered
to detect small effects in diarrhoea prevalence and
length-for-age _Z score had they been present. Lower_
adherence to the water and handwashing interventions


by the end of the 2 years of intervention does not seem to
be the only explanation for the absence of benefits: there
were also no reductions in diarrhoea or improvements in
growth in children in the water, handwashing, sanitation,
or combined water, sanitation, and handwashing groups
even in the first year (a typical measurement point in
previous trials), when community-based promoters were
most active and adherence was higher, whereas almost
all of the growth benefits in the nutrition group and
combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition
group were already manifest in the first year Adherence


-----

to the interventions was comparable to or better
than what a government or large non-governmental
organisation might hope to achieve at scale (appendix
p 22), with increases in adherence indicators of
30 percentage points or higher in all intervention
groups relative to the control in the first year.
These findings contrast with several systematic
reviews[13–15] that have found significant protective benefits
of water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions (including
handwashing) on diarrhoea in efficacy trials, although
most of these studies were shorter and had higher
adherence. Results from other trials[16–18] also showed no
effect of improved sanitation on diarrhoea, although
differences in contexts and interventions complicate
comparisons between these trials. Our trial differed from
previous trials in that the intervention shifted households
from unimproved sanitation (rather than open defecation)
to improved sanitation. Additionally, the prevalence of
diarrhoea in this study population was high, consistent
with prevalence in 12–23-month-old infants measured in
the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey [19]


A systematic review and meta-analysis[20] of the effects
of water quality and supply, sanitation, and hygiene
interventions to improve growth identified only five
randomised controlled trials of water or handwashing
interventions, which did not suggest strong effects on
growth, perhaps in part because the interventions lasted
only 9–12 months. Since then, five more randomised
trials of sanitation interventions have generated mixed
evidence on child growth effects: two trials done in India
and one in Indonesia had low adherence and no effect,
and two done in settings with high rates of open
defecation in India and Mali showed improvements in
length-for-age Z score of 0·18–0·40 in children younger
than 5 years.[16–18,20–22] The sanitation intervention in our
trial was aligned with the focus on improved latrines
initiated under the Millennium Development Goals, and
the Sustainable Development Goals’ recognition that
children’s faeces also need to be safely disposed of. This
trial and its companion trial[9] in Bangladesh suggest that
a compound-level approach to upgrading existing latrines
and safely disposing of children’s faeces is not sufficient


-----

to improve child growth, and neither are water and
handwashing interventions.
Conversely, counselling and LNS provided in the
nutrition group improved length-for-age Z score by year 2.
Compared with randomised controlled trials of LNS during
complementary feeding, our finding of length-for-age
_Z score improvements of 0·13–0·16 in the nutrition groups_
falls in the middle of the spectrum between four trials: one
from Malawi[23] that reported no effect on length-for-age
_Z score, one from Haiti[24] and one from Bangladesh[25] that_
reported an effect on length-for-age Z score comparable to
this study and one from Burkina Faso[26] that reported a


larger effect on length-for-age Z score. Thus, there appears
to be consistent evidence that LNS distribution together
with some promotion of improved infant and young child
feeding can reduce growth faltering, although this approach
falls far short of eliminating the problem. Interventions
will likely need to address the complex set of underlying
determinants of growth faltering, including prenatal or
preconception factors. Future analyses will explore changes
in feeding practices that resulted from the intervention.
Although there were more improvements in anthro­
pometric measures in the combined water, sanitation,
handwashing and nutrition group versus active control


-----

than in the nutrition versus active control group, the
differences were of little clinical or statistical significance.
We conclude that combining nutrition with water,
sanitation, and handwashing did not provide additional
growth benefits beyond nutrition alone. Although the
effect of water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition
on mortality was not significant, the lower mortality in
that group is consistent with the statistically significant
effect of water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition
on mortality in the Bangladesh trial.[9] Pending analyses
will evaluate potential differences in effects on other
child health outcomes.
It is possible that the water, sanitation, and
handwashing interventions delivered in this trial did not
sufficiently address important transmission routes for
enteric pathogens.[11] Although the sanitation intervention
included a sani-scoop and messages about preventing
children from being exposed to domestic animal faeces,
the emphasis was mostly on behaviours related to human
faeces and might not have protected children from
zoonotic pathogens.[27] Although chlorination of water has
the advantage of providing residual protection against
recontamination, it is not effective against protozoa such
as Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium spp, the latter of
which was identified as one of the most common causes
of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children 0–23 months
in a neighbouring part of Kenya.[28] Other limitations
of this trial include the inability to mask the inter­
ventions; the absence of observable indicators of
actual behaviour for the handwashing, sanitation, and
nutrition interventions; lower adherence to the water and
hygiene interventions during the second year of the trial
than in the first year; and the use of a compound-level
sanitation intervention, as opposed to community-level.
Because masking was not possible, we focused on
objective, observable indicators when­ever possible rather
than self-reported behaviours, recognising that the
availability of a latrine or hand­washing station stocked
with water and soap does not necessarily imply that the
materials were used. Despite an intensive design process
that drew heavily on best practices in behaviour change,
incorporation of lessons learned from the pilot
randomised controlled trial, thorough verification of
availability of the intervention materials, and periodic
monitoring of indicators of recommended behaviours,
adherence to the water and handwashing interventions
appeared to reduce sharply in the last months of the trial.
The waning intensity of promotion activities after a
reduction in the stipend given to the health promoters
could at least partly explain the drop in adherence.
Finally, by contrast with water, handwashing, and
nutrition interventions that directly benefit households
that adhere to the intervention, a sanitation intervention
in only a subset of compounds might not be sufficient to
protect against exposure to faecal contamination in the
environ­ment that originates from other compounds in
the community We decided however to deliver


compound-level interventions based on evidence that
child exposure to enteric pathogens during the first
2 years of life occurs predominantly within the household
com­pound.[29] Because environmental contamination and
disease transmission pathways could be different in
densely populated contexts, similar studies in urban
areas would complement this rural trial.
Additional outcome measures collected in this trial
will help to elucidate potential mechanisms for the
observed effects, including indicators of environ­­
mental contamination, environmental enteric dys­
function, anaemia, enteric parasite infection, and child
development. Molecular measurement of infections in
the laboratory with stored stool specimens collected as
part of this trial offer an opportunity for unbiased
indicators of pathogen burden.
More intensive promotion and higher adherence could
have resulted in larger effects than those reported, but our
findings are relevant for large-scale programmes that
struggle to achieve adherence rates as high as those of
efficacy studies. The potential for water, sanitation,
hygiene, and nutrition interventions to reduce diarrhoea
and improve growth might be highly context-dependent.
In our rural setting, water was plentiful but rarely available
on premises, susceptible to contamination at the source
and in storage, and rarely treated despite introduction
of a nearly-universal filter distribution programme;[30]
unimproved latrine coverage was high and there was a
culture of using sanitation facilities for defecation by
human beings, but there was probably persistent exposure
to animal faeces; handwashing was not a common
practice; breastfeeding was common, but exclusive
breastfeeding was not, and most people had enough food,
but not a diverse diet; diarrhoea prevalence was high; and
many children had low length-for-age _Z score, but not_
weight-for-length Z score. Our findings call into question
the ability of large-scale water, sanitation, and hand­
washing interventions to reduce diarrhoea or improve
growth. Our results suggest that integrated water,
sanitation, and handwashing and nutrition programmes
are no more effective than nutrition programmes at
reducing diarrhoea or improving growth, and that
nutritional interventions that include counselling and
LNS can modestly reduce growth faltering, but fall short
of eliminating it, even when LNS adherence is high.
