Transmission 
of enteric 
pathogens 
is facilitated 
in child day care centers, including 
family 
day care homes, by frequent 
and intimate 
exposure among susceptible 
hosts, 
with diaper 
changing 
as the highest-risk 
procedure 
for such transmission. 
The 
objective 
of this study was to evaluate 
the effectiveness of an intervention 
program 
in decreasing 
the incidence 
of infectious 
disease symptoms 
in children 
attending 
family 
day care homes during 
a 12-month 
period. 
Each of 24 family day care homes 
was randomly 
assigned to an intervention 
or control 
group. The intervention 
included 
four components: 
(1) a handwashing 
educational 
program 
and (2) use of 
vinyl gloves, (3) use of disposable 
diaper 
changing 
pads, and (4) use of an 
alcohol-based 
hand rinse by the day care provider. 
Symptoms 
of enteric 
disease 
(diarrhea 
and vomiting) 
were significantly 
reduced 
in intervention 
family 
day care 
homes (p s 0.05), whereas respiratory 
symptoms 
were not significantly 
different 
between 
intervention 
and control 
family 
day care homes (p = 0.35). Diarrhea 
was 
reported 
in 1 of every 100 child care days, representing 
one diarrhea 
episode per 
month 
in a typical 
family 
day care home. (AM J INFECT 
CONTROL 
1990; 
18:347-53). 
More than half of U.S. women 
with children 
under 
the age of 6 years are currently 
in the 
labor force. Child care is provided 
for more pre- 
school age children 
in family 
day care homes 
(37%) (FDCHs) 
than in in-home 
care (31%) or 
day care centers 
(23%).’

Transmission 
of certain 
infectious 
diseases 
have been associated 
with day care centers, in- 
cluding

of infectious

those associ- 
ated with 
diarrhea, 
in day care centers

direct 
threats 
to i,nfants and toddlers,

subsequently 
likely 
to infect 
others.g, lo Diar-

ious enteropathogens.” 
Asymptomatic 
shedding 
of specific 
entero- 
pathogens 
is an additional 
source of transmis- 
sion in children 
in day care. Asymptomatic 
ex- 
cretion 
of rotavirus 
in stools occurred 
in 32% 
of children 
tested 
during 
the first 
week after 
diarrhea 
and in 50% of children 
1 day before 
diarrhea. 
This shedding 
represents 
a source of 
transmission 
that 
could 
potentially 
be inter- 
rupted 
by handwashing 
and hygienic 
diaper 
handling.12 
Transmission 
of enteric 
pathogens 
through 
person-to-person 
spread 
or through 
fomites 
is facilitated 
in child day care centers,

ing 
FDCHs,

and 
inti- 
mate exposure

susceptible 
hosts,13,‘4 the

a role in the 
transmission 
of enteropathogens

outbreaks?,

Diaper 
changing 
has been suggested 
as the 
highest-risk 
procedure 
for transmission 
of en- 
teropathogens 
among 
day care children 
and 
personnel.17 
Although 
a rigorous 
handwashing 
intervention 
was demonstrated 
in one study to 
reduce 
the incidence 
of nonspecific 
diarrhea1 
illness in large day care centers,15 few studies 
have examined 
the association 
of inadequate 
handwashing 
and 
poor 
hygienic 
diaper 
han- 
dling practices 
on the transmission 
of diarrhea1 
disease in FDCHs. 
The objective 
of this study 
was to evaluate 
the effectiveness 
of an intervention 
program 
in 
decreasing 
the incidence 
of symptoms 
associ- 
ated with enteric and respiratory 
infectious 
dis- 
eases among 
2-month-old 
to 7-year-old 
children 
attending 
FDCHs. 
MATERIAL 
AND 
METHOD8 
FDCHs 
are defined 
(in Maryland) 
as regis- 
tered day care homes 
that 
enroll 
six or fewer 
children 
for part-time 
or full-time 
day care. 
Forty-seven 
family 
day care providers 
were ran- 
domly 
selected by number 
from a list of FDCHs 
registered 
in the city of Baltimore 
and were con- 
tacted 
by telephone; 
24 (5 1%) agreed to partic- 
ipate in the study. 
Names 
were obtained 
from 
a list of FDCHs 
provided 
by the local Depart- 
ment 
of Social Services, Division 
of Day Care. 
After 
signed 
consent 
was obtained 
from 
day 
care providers, 
each FDCH 
was randomly 
as- 
signed 
to the control 
group 
(n = 12) or inter- 
vention 
group 
(n = 12). To reduce 
reporting 
bias, all day care providers 
were aware that the 
intervention 
program 
was being 
tested in cer- 
tain homes. 
Parental 
consent 
for recording 
of 
daily 
symptoms 
for each child 
(n = 114) en- 
rolled in the FDCHs was obtained 
by telephone. 
The study 
was approved 
by the Human 
Sub- 
jects Committee 
of The Johns Hopkins 
Univer- 
sity Medical 
School. 
Baseline 
health 
data on each child were ob- 
tained 
from 
the parent 
by telephone 
interview 
within 
2 months 
of enrollment 
in the study. All 
new children 
who entered 
the FDCHs were re- 
cruited 
into the study. Children 
departing 
from 
a FDCH were not followed 
after their departure. 
Sociodemographic 
data on day care personnel 
were obtained 
on their 
entry 
into the study. 
Exclusion 
criteria 
for sick children 
were as- 
certained 
from 
each day care provider 
before 
data collection. 
Equal 
proportion 
of interven- 
tion as well as control 
day care personnel 
stated 
that fever, defined 
as “forehead 
warm 
to touch” 
or a temperature 
greater 
than 100” F (91%), and 
diarrhea 
(82%) were used as exclusionary 
cri- 
teria 
for 
sick 
children. 
Other 
exclusionary 
symptoms 
were reported 
at lower levels: runny 
nose (55%) 
skin rashes (27%), and cough (18%). 
Intervention. 
The intervention 
program 
con- 
sisted of in-home 
instruction 
to day care pro- 
viders by the investigators 
during 
the first four 
home 
visits. 
The intervention 
instruction 
in- 
cluded 
modes 
of transmission 
of pathogens 
in 
the home, indications 
for handwashing, 
and the 
use of vinyl gloves and disposable 
diaper chang- 
ing pads at each diaper 
change. 
Providers 
were 
instructed 
to dispose of the gloves, disposable 
pads, 
and 
diapers 
in plastic 
bags. 
Between 
handwashes, 
when 
the providers 
were unable 
to wash their hands with 
soap and water,

were instructed 
to use an alcohol-based 
(60% 
isopropyl 
alcohol) 
hand 
rinse (Cal STAT, Cal- 
gon Corp., St. Louis, MO.). All supplies were pro- 
vided 
to each intervention 
day care provider. 
This combined 
intervention 
was chosen to max- 
imize any beneficial 
effects. The control 
homes 
received 
no educational 
intervention 
but 
re- 
ceived biweekly 
nurse visits for symptom 
data 
collection. 
Assessment of symptoms. 
Daily symptom 
rec- 
ords for each child 
were kept by all day care 
providers 
for a 12-month 
study 
period. 
Each 
day the provider 
recorded 
the following 
symp- 
toms for each child: 
diarrhea, 
vomiting, 
runny 
nose, and absence from 
day care home. 
All ab- 
sent days, including 
those for vacation, 
mater- 
nal illness, and days off, were recorded. 
Reason 
for absenteeism 
was not recorded. 
If no data 
were recorded 
on any given day, that day’s data 
were coded as missing. 
Definitions 
of symptoms 
were 
provided 
to 
providers. 
Diarrhea 
was defined 
as the occur- 
rence of loose, unformed 
bowel 
movements 
at 
twice the normal 
frequency. 
Normal 
frequency 
of bowel movements 
was further 
defined for the 
day care providers: 
infants, 
one to two stools 
per day; and older children, 
one stool per day. 
The presence 
or absence of symptoms 
was re- 
corded 
only for days of attendance; 
no record- 
ing of symptoms 
was attempted 
in the child’s 
home. 
Every 2 weeks a registered 
nurse visited 
each FDCH 
to collect 
the completed 
symptom 
records. All providers, 
control 
and intervention, 
were 
remunerated 
with 
$2.00 
during 
the bi- 
weekly 
visits as well as an additional 
amount 
three 
times 
during 
the study 
period 
for com- 
pleting 
the symptom 
records. 
Statistical 
analysis. 
The proportion 
of child 
symptom 
days (diarrhea, 
vomiting, 
and runny 
nose) was calculated 
for all children 
for each 
month 
and plotted 
across the 12-month 
study 
period 
to ascertain 
seasonal trends in symptom 
reporting. 
The trends reported 
do not necessar- 
ily reflect 
the same children 
during 
the study 
period. 
Each month 
represented 
an indepen- 
dent proportion 
of child 
symptom 
days. Mul- 
tiple symptoms 
are reported 
as group rates, not 
by the individual 
child. Additionally, 
a series of 
chi-square 
tests of association 
were performed 
to compare 
the intervention 
and control 
homes 
for the number 
of symptom 
days reported 
dur- 
ing 
the 
12-month 
period 
(significance 
level 
p = 0.0s). 
RESULTS 
Population. 
During 
the period 
from 
Jan. 4, 
1988, to Dec. 31, 1988, 114 children 
were en- 
rolled 
from 
24 FDCHs. 
From 
all FDCHs, 
only 
two children 
were not enrolled. 
Baseline 
data 
are reported 
on 108 children 
(95%) whose par- 
ents could 
be contacted 
by telephone. 
During 
the 12-month 
period, 
47 children 
(27 control, 
20 intervention) 
departed 
from 
and 19 (8 con- 
trol, 
11 intervention) 
new children 
entered 
the 
FDCHs, 
accounting 
for 86 children 
enrolled 
at 
the termination 
of the study. 
Two FDCHs (one 
control, 
one 
intervention) 
discontinued 
care 
during 
the 12-month 
study 
period, 
accounting 
for 11 of the departing 
children. 
The majority 
(68%) of children 
departing 
from 
day care left 
during 
the second half of the study period. 
Sociodemographic 
characteristics 
of the chil- 
dren 
by type of home 
are shown 
in Table 
1. 
There 
were 
no statistically 
significant 
differ- 
ences between 
the two 
groups 
of children 
by 
age, sex, race, maternal 
age, preexisting 
health 
condition, 
or number 
of siblings 
in their home. 
A preexisting 
health 
condition, 
which 
was re- 
ported 
by 19% of all children, 
included 
asthma, 
recurrent 
ear infections, 
cerebral 
palsy, 
ven- 
tricular 
septal 
defect, 
chronic 
constipation, 
cancer, and seizures. There were no statistically 
significant 
sociodemographic 
differences 
in the 
control 
or intervention 
providers 
(Table 2). The 
providers 
tended 
to be older 
(mean 
age 48.5 
years), and more than half (58%) had not com- 
pleted 
high school. 
Symptom reports. During 
the study 
period, 
a 
total 
of 20,587 child 
days were included 
(con- 
trol, 
10,428 
days; 
intervention, 
10,159 
days), 
with 
an average 
daily 
census of 100 children 
(control, 
47.5 children/day; 
intervention, 
52.5 
children/day) 
aged 1 month 
to 7 years. Absent 
days totaled 
1727 (8.4%), and missing 
days to- 
taled 461 (2.2%) during 
the 12-month 
study pe- 
riod. 
Absent 
and missing 
days were excluded

The seasonal distribution 
of diarrhea,

symptoms 
is shown 
in 
Fig. 1; diarrhea 
symptom 
report 
rates peaked 
in 
mid-winter 
(February) 
and 
mid-summer 
(July). 
Vomiting 
report 
rates 
paralleled 
the 
mid-winter 
peak but did not parallel 
the mid- 
summer 
peak. 
Runny 
nose report 
rates also 
peaked in the winter 
months, 
declined 
through 
the spring and summer, 
and peaked again dur- 
ing the fall. 
Total days by symptom 
are shown 
in Table 
3. Runny 
nose reports 
occurred 
during 
195 1 
(9.5%) of all child days. Other symptoms 
were 
reported 
at lower rates for all child days: diar- 
rhea, 226 (1.1%); and vomiting, 
85 (0.4%). Sig- 
nificant 
differences 
were observed 
between 
in- 
tervention 
and control 
homes for symptoms 
of 
diarrhea 
and vomiting 
(Table 3). 
Enteric 
symptoms 
(diarrhea 
and vomiting) 
were 
compared 
by 
intervention 
or control 
FDCHs across the study period. 
Diarrhea 
and 
vomiting 
rates were reported 
at higher or com- 
parable 
levels in the control 
homes compared 
with the intervention 
homes during 
the major- 
ity of the study 
period. 
Diarrhea 
rates were 
higher 
in control 
homes 
during 
the 
first 
8 
months, 
at which 
time the intervention 
homes 
then reported 
higher 
rates of diarrhea 
during 
the 
remaining 
period, 
but 
not 
significantly 
higher 
than because of chance.

with intervention. 
Distribution 
of 
supplies 
(disposable 
pads, boxes of gloves (100 
gloves per box), and 4-ounce 
bottles 
of hand 
rinse solution 
were tallied 
on a monthly 
basis. 
Assessment 
of compliance 
was based 
on the 
continual 
demand 
for supplies. 
The average 
number 
of supplies 
distributed 
to intervention 
homes per month 
included

DISCUSSION 
Prevention 
and control 
of infectious 
diseases 
in day care facilities 
depends 
on maintenance 
of optimal 
hygienic 
standards. 
Handwashing 
by providers 
is considered 
the single most im- 
portant 
preventive 
measure” 
in day care facil- 
ities. The results of our study demonstrate 
that 
symptoms 
of enteric disease (diarrhea 
and vom- 
iting) 
are lowered 
in FDCHs when specific hy- 
gienic 
measures 
such 
as handwashing, 
use 
of vinyl 
gloves, 
disposable 
diaper 
pads, and 
alcohol-based 
hand rinse are used. The relative 
contribution 
of each component 
of the inter- 
vention 
cannot 
be distinguished 
in our data be- 
cause the intervention 
was devised to produce 
the maximum 
effect in low-income, 
inner-city 
FDCHs. 
To test each component 
of the inter- 
vention, 
a larger sample size would be required. 
Further 
studies 
need to be undertaken 
to de- 
termine 
which factor is responsible 
for lowering 
the symptom 
rates reported 
in the intervention 
FDCHs . 
Fecal coli’form 
bacteria 
and rotavirus 
have 
been detected 
in day care centers on environ- 
mental 
surfaces, 
including 
diaper 
changing 
areas, carpet, and teachers’ 
hands.18-2o The sim-

ter, was detected 
for 30 minutes 
on counter 
tops, but the virus survived 
longer 
when 
sus- 
pended in fecal ‘material” 
or at high or low hu- 
midity. *’ This suggests 
that these enteropath- 
ogens can remain 
viable on contaminated 
sur- 
faces, such as the diaper 
changing 
area and 
hands of day care personnel, 
long enough 
to be 
transmitted 
to susceptible 
children. 
Use of vinyl 
gloves and 
disposable 
diaper 
changing 
pads 
may explain 
the reduced 
diarrhea 
and vomiting 
symptom 
reports 
of the intervention 
homes. 
All symptom 
reports 
were based on the pro- 
viders’ 
subjective 
assessments. 
Although 
defi- 
nitions 
were provided, 
no validity 
testing 
was 
possible 
during 
the study. 
However, 
the fact 
that 
seasonal 
trends 
were 
consistent 
across 
homes and consistent 
with patterns 
associated 
with 
infectious 
diarrhea 
lends credence 
to the 
providers’ 
assessments. 
Underreporting 
rather 
than 
overreporting 
of symptoms 
by the busy 
providers 
is more 
likely 
in these data. 
Fever 
symptoms 
were recorded. 
Initial 
home teaching 
included 
use of a thermometer 
to measure fever. 
However, 
because of the providers’ 
inconsistent 
use of thermometers 
and use of “tactile 
fever” 
determination, 
the fever 
data 
were 
not 
re- 
ported. 
With the majority 
of providers 
report- 
ing less than 
a high school education, 
record 
keeping 
by the providers 
was designed 
to be 
simple 
and efficient, 
to optimize 
compliance. 
Diarrhea 
outbreaks 
in day care centers 
are 
generally 
due to transmission 
of organisms 
re- 
quiring 
low inoculum 
(Shigellu, 
Giardia 
lum- 
bIia).** However, 
the infective 
dose of rotavirus 
is unknown. 
Placing children 
in separate rooms 
(isolation) 
in day care centers while they were 
receiving 
therapy 
for shigellosis 
was useful in 
containing 
a diarrhea1 
outbreak, 
thus allowing 
children 
to return 
to day care sooner.7 However, 
segregation 
of potentially 
infectious 
children 
is 
not feasible 
in FDCHs. 
Rather, 
excluding 
ill 
children 
from 
care is the usual practice. 
Our 
data demonstrate 
that young 
children 
do fre- 
quently 
attend 
FDCHs with 
symptoms 
of res- 
piratory 
diseases. Additionally, 
diarrhea 
was 
reported 
in one of every 100 child care days. 
This represents 
one diarrhea 
episode per month 
in a typical 
FDCH. 
Increased 
attention 
to handwashing 
by day 
care providers 
and the use of disposable 
diaper 
changing 
pads 
may 
reduce 
the incidence 
of 
diarrhea1 
disease. In addition, 
it would 
be pru- 
dent for providers 
to wear vinyl gloves for dia- 
per changing 
or for assisting 
children 
with 
toi- 
leting when children 
with symptoms 
of enteric 
disease attend 
their homes. 
It is possible 
that 
certain enteric pathogens 
will be more sensitive 
to these measures than others. The lack of effect 
of our intervention 
on respiratory 
symptoms 
suggest that other measures are required 
to pre- 
vent transmission 
of respiratory 
pathogens.
