EARLY 2 MILLION CHILDREN
die annually from diarrheal
disease.1 A recent meta-
analysis concluded that
handwashing promotion interven-
tions decrease diarrhea by a mean of
47%.2 The authors estimate that such
interventions could prevent 1 million
child deaths per year.2 However, the sys-
tematic meta-analysis and the studies
it included summarized the reduction
in diarrheal rates among all children or
all family members. But all family mem-
bers are not at equal risk of death from
diarrhea. Children younger than 5 years
are at much higher risk of death from
diarrheathanolderchildrenandadults,1
and infants (younger than 1 year) are
at the highest risk of death. Verbal au-
topsy studies from Egypt,3 Pakistan,4
Bangladesh,5 and Ethiopia6 report that
43% to 78% of deaths from diarrhea
among children younger than 5 years
occur in the first year of life.
Infants cannot wash their own hands
and therefore cannot interrupt the
transfer of pathogens between their
hands and their mouth. Infants might
benefit from a lower rate of diarrheal
pathogen transmission from parents
and siblings who wash their hands more

Context Washing hands with soap prevents diarrhea, but children at the highest risk
of death from diarrhea are younger than 1 year, too young to wash their own hands.
Previous studies lacked sufficient power to assess the impact of household handwash-
ing on diarrhea in infants.
Objective To evaluate the effect of promoting household handwashing with soap
among children at the highest risk of death from diarrhea.
Design, Setting, and Participants A cluster randomized controlled trial of 36 low-
income neighborhoods in urban squatter settlements in Karachi, Pakistan. Field work-
ers visited participating households at least weekly from April 15, 2002, to April 5,
2003. Eligible households located in the study area had at least 2 children younger
than 15 years, at least 1 of whom was younger than 5 years.
Interventions Weekly visits in 25 neighborhoods to promote handwashing with soap
after defecation and before preparing food, eating, and feeding a child. Within inter-
vention neighborhoods, 300 households (1523 children) received a regular supply of
antibacterial soap and 300 households (1640 children) received plain soap. Eleven neigh-
borhoods (306 households and 1528 children) comprised the control group.
Main Outcome Measure Incidence density of diarrhea among children, defined
as the number of diarrheal episodes per 100 person-weeks of observation.
Results Children younger than 15 years living in households that received hand-
washing promotion and plain soap had a 53% lower incidence of diarrhea (95% con-
fidence interval [CI], –65% to –41%) compared with children living in control neigh-
borhoods. Infants living in households that received handwashing promotion and plain
soap had 39% fewer days with diarrhea (95% CI, –61% to –16%) vs infants living in
control neighborhoods. Severely malnourished children (weight for age z score, –3.0)
younger than 5 years living in households that received handwashing promotion and
plain soap had 42% fewer days with diarrhea (95% CI, –69% to –16%) vs severely
malnourished children in the control group. Similar reductions in diarrhea were ob-
served among children living in households receiving antibacterial soap.
Conclusion In a setting in which diarrhea is a leading cause of child death, improve-
ment in handwashing in the household reduced the incidence of diarrhea among chil-
dren at high risk of death from diarrhea.

frequently with soap but the benefit to
the infant might be quite different from
the overall benefit.
We identified only 2 handwashing in-
tervention trials from developing coun-
tries that reported diarrheal rates among
infants.7,8 In 1 study in which the inter-
vention assignment was randomized,7
theanalysisaccountedfortheclusterde-
sign but the measured 24% reduction in
diarrheal disease among children
younger than 1 year was not signifi-
cantly different from the control group.
A second handwashing promotion
study8 reported a 61% reduction in di-
arrheal disease among children younger
than 1 year but there was only 1 inter-
vention handwashing promotion com-
munity and 1 control community. The
datawereanalyzedattheindividuallevel
and the repeated measures of each in-
dividual were not accounted for in the
analysis.8
In addition to young age, malnutri-
tion9-11 and persistent diarrhea10,12,13 are
important risk factors for death from di-
arrhea. We cannot identify any hand-
washing intervention trials that evalu-
ated effectiveness among malnourished
childrenorforpersistentdiarrhea.Thus,
the effectiveness of handwashing with
soap in preventing diarrhea among the
most vulnerable children is unclear.
InKarachi,Pakistan,morethan4mil-
lion low-income residents live in squat-
ter settlements where they do not own
legal title to the land and municipal in-
frastructure is limited.14 A verbal au-
topsy study from these communities
concluded that 41% of all childhood
deaths younger than 5 years were due
to diarrhea.15 Seventy-three percent of
these diarrheal deaths occurred among
infants.15 We evaluated whether pro-
moting washing hands with soap de-
creased diarrhea among children at the
highest risk of death from diarrhea in
Karachi squatter settlements.
METHODS
Setting
TheKarachiSoapHealthStudywascon-
ducted in adjoining multiethnic squat-
ter settlements in central Karachi—
Bilal, Hazara, Manzoor, and Mujahid
colonies—in collaboration with Health
OrientedPreventiveEducation(HOPE),
anongovernmentalorganizationthatop-
erates local health clinics and supports
community-based health and develop-
ment initiatives.
Most residents in these communi-
ties have household toilets but the dis-
chargeflowsintoopensewers.Afterdef-
ecation, toilet paper is rarely used.
Instead, residents routinely rinse their
anus with water from a pitcher. Al-
though handwashing, typically with wa-
ter alone, is part of ritual preparation for
prayer in these communities, thorough
washing of hands with soap is less com-
mon, even though affordable hand soap
is widely available throughout these
communities from small neighbor-
hood shops. The water used for drink-
ing and handwashing in these commu-
nities is heavily contaminated with fecal
organisms.16 Hands are typically dried
on clothing. Clothing is usually laun-
dered after several days of wear.
Study Groups
Field workers identified 42 candidate
neighborhoods of 60 to 273 house-
holds, separated from one another by a
streetormarketarea.Fieldworkerscon-
ducted a census of these neighbor-
hoods, and before intervention assign-
ment, identified and obtained informed
consent from 1050 households. Eli-
gible households were located in the
study area, had at least 2 children
younger than 15 years, at least 1 of
whom was younger than 5 years, and
planned to continue to reside in their
homes for the duration of the study.
The field workers listed the candi-
date neighborhoods in order of prox-
imity to their field center. One of the in-
vestigators not involved in recruiting
neighborhoods or households (S.P.L.)
programmed a spreadsheet to generate
randomly the integers 1 or 2 with twice
the probability of generating a 2 vs a 1.
Heappliedtherandomnumberssequen-
tially to the list of neighborhoods. Those
neighborhoods with a 1 were assigned
to control and those with a 2 were as-
signedtohandwashingpromotion.Ran-
dom assignment continued until neigh-
borhoods comprising 600 handwashing
promotion households and 306 con-
trol households were assigned. Ulti-
mately, 25 neighborhoods were as-
signed to handwashing promotion and
11 to control (FIGURE 1). Handwash-
ingpromotionwasassignedattheneigh-
borhood level because a number of the
handwashing promotion activities were
neighborhood-level activities. Antibac-
terial vs plain soap was randomly as-
signed at the household level.
Interventions
Handwashing Promotion. Field work-
ers conducted neighborhood meetings
about handwashing. They used slide
shows, videotapes, and pamphlets to il-
lustrate health problems resulting from
contaminated hands and to provide spe-
cifichandwashinginstructions.Thecore
handwashing promotion activity was
regular, at least weekly, household vis-
its by the field workers. Each field
worker spoke the first language of the
study households they visited. They de-
scribedindetailtheimportanceofhand-
washing. They encouraged partici-
pants to wet their hands, lather them
completely with soap, and rub them to-
gether for 45 seconds. Hands were typi-
cally dried on the participants’ cloth-
ing. Field workers encouraged all
persons in intervention households old
enough to understand (generally those
participants older than 30 months) to
wash their hands after defecation and
cleaning an infant who had defecated,
and before preparing food, eating, and
feeding infants. They encouraged adopt-
ing regular handwashing habits. Field
workers also encouraged participants to
bathe once a day with soap and water.
Fieldworkersencouragedquestionsand
discussionabouthandwashing.Theyre-
supplied the families with soap as
needed. Field workers did not provide
educational messages on water treat-
ment, food hygiene, or other strategies
to decrease diarrhea.
Soap. The antibacterial soap con-
tained 1.2% triclocarban as an antibac-
terial agent. The plain soap was identi-
cal to the antibacterial soap with the
single exception that it did not contain

triclocarban. Both soaps were provided
as 90-g white bars without a brand name
or symbol and packaged identically in
agenericwhitewrapper.Casesof96bars
were identified by serial numbers that
were matched to households. Neither
the field workers nor the families knew
whether the family’s soap was antibac-
terial or plain.
Control. Field workers provided con-
trol households with a regular supply of
children’s books, notebooks, pens, and
pencils to help with their children’s edu-
cationbutnoproductsthatwouldbeex-
pected to affect diarrhea. Field workers
neither encouraged nor discouraged
handwashing in control households.
Field workers visited control and inter-
vention households with equal fre-
quency to collect health outcome data
but the visits were shorter in control
households because no health educa-
tion or encouragement for behavior
change was provided.
Field Workers
Field workers recruited from the study
or nearby communities were exten-
sively trained in interviewing tech-
niques, data recording, approaches to
promote handwashing, and measuring
and weighing children. The same field
workers promoted handwashing and
collected outcome data during their
household visits.
Measurements
Trained field workers conducted a pre-
intervention baseline survey of house-
holdcharacteristics.Theyidentifiedeach
child (aged 15 years) in the house-
hold. Children’s dates of birth were con-
firmed with birth certificates or immu-
nization records. Field workers visited
participating households at least weekly
for 1 year (April 15, 2002, to April 5,
2003) and asked the mother or other
caregiver if the children had diarrhea
(3 loose stools within 24 hours) in the
precedingweek,and,ifso,forhowmany
days. Typically, field workers visited
each household twice during the week
to ensure that episodes of diarrhea from
both early and late in the week were re-
called. Supervisors revisited 40% of
homes each week and reviewed the his-
tory of diarrhea among family mem-
bers. The history recorded by the su-
pervisor was compared with the history
recordedbythefieldworkerand,ifthere
was a discrepancy, the fieldworker and
supervisor revisited the house to clarify
the difference.
Field workers weighed participating
children younger than 5 years at base-
line and every 4 months. Field workers
weighed children 3 years or younger by
using a hanging scale (Salter, Ton-
bridge, Kent, England) and children
older than 3 years by using a bathroom
scale. We calculated weight for age z
scores to compare the study children’s
weight with the National Center for
Health Statistics standards. The z score
represents the number of standard de-
viationsthatthechild’smeasuredweight
for age differs from the standard healthy
population. We calculated the mean
weight for age z score from the mul-
tiple weighing sessions throughout the
study for each child. We classified chil-
drenasmoderatelymalnourishediftheir
meanweightforagezscorewaslessthan
–2.0 and −3.0 or higher, and severely
malnourished if their mean weight for
age z score was less than –3.0.
Statistics
A primary hypothesis of the Karachi
Soap Health Study was that promoting
handwashing with antibacterial or plain
soap would significantly reduce the
amount of diarrheal illness compared
with standard habits and practices in the
control group. (Other primary hypoth-
eses of the Karachi Soap Health Study
address the effectiveness of bathing and
handwashing with antibacterial or plain
soap in preventing impetigo and acute
respiratory illness and will be reported
separately.) A primary study outcome
wastheincidencedensityofdiarrhea(ie,
the number of new episodes of diar-
rhea divided by the at-risk person-
weeks of observation). We considered
a child at risk for a new episode of di-
arrhea if he or she reported no diarrhea
in the previous week. We also mea-
sured disease outcome using longitudi-

nal prevalence because it is more closely
associated with growth faltering and
child mortality than is diarrhea inci-
dence.17 We calculated longitudinal
prevalence by summing the number of
days each child had diarrhea and divid-
ing by the total number of days of ob-
servation.
We calculated a sample size of 239
households per intervention group, as-
suming 1.2 episodes of diarrhea per 100
person-weeks among children younger
than 15 years in the control group, 25%
lower incidence of diarrhea in each
handwashing promotion group vs con-
trol, 3.8 children per household, and
a doubling of sample size to offset the
effect of clustering by neighborhood
and repeated measures. We increased
the sample size to 300 households per
intervention group to assess other
health outcomes, which will be re-
ported separately.
Because we assigned soap promo-
tionvscontrolattheneighborhoodlevel,
we analyzed the comparison of out-
comes at the neighborhood level. Spe-
cifically, within each neighborhood
among person-weeks within the sub-
group of interest, we identified the total
number of new episodes of diarrhea or
days of diarrhea and divided it by the
total number of person-weeks at risk for
childreninthatneighborhoodwithinthe
subgroupofinterest.Wecalculatedrates

mean of the appropriate neighborhood
rates, weighted by the person-weeks of

that contributed to the mean. We cal-
culated rate ratios by dividing the
weighted means from intervention
neighborhoods by the weighted means
from control neighborhoods.18 We cal-
culated95%confidenceintervalsaround
these rate ratios using Taylor Series ap-
proximations to obtain SEs.19 This ap-
proach calculated confidence intervals

bution of proportions at the neighbor-
hoodlevel.Wereportthepercentagedif-

analyzed with the group they were origi-

analysis). We considered P.05 as sta-
tistically significant. We used SAS ver-
sion 9.0 and JMP version 5.0 (SAS In-
stitute Inc, Cary, NC) to conduct the
statistical analysis.
Ethics
Community leaders and heads of house-
holds provided informed consent. Ill
children were assessed by field work-
ers and referred to the appropriate level
of health care. The first line of treat-
ment for diarrhea was oral rehydration
solution. Ill children referred by field
workers were offered clinical services
free of charge at HOPE health care fa-
cilities located in these communities.
The study protocol was approved by the
ethicsreviewcommitteeoftheAgaKhan
University and an institutional review
board of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention.
RESULTS
The 36 neighborhoods in the study in-
cluded a median 115 households
(range, 60-273 households). A me-
dian of 21% of households in each
neighborhood (range, 6%-39%) met the
eligibility criteria for the study. All eli-
gible households chose to enroll. Thus,
for the study, a median 26 households
participated per neighborhood (range,
9-37; interquartile range, 21-30).
Within the 25 neighborhoods random-
ized to handwashing promotion, 300
households (1523 children) were ran-
domized to receive antibacterial soap
and 300 households (1640 children)
were randomized to receive plain soap
(Figure 1). Eleven neighborhoods, rep-
resenting 306 households and 1528
children, were randomized to the stan-
dard habits and practices control group.

During 51 weeks of follow-up, diar-
rhea outcome information was col-
lected on 210133 person-weeks, rep-
resenting 89% of the study populations’
experience (88% in antibacterial soap,
89% in plain soap, and 89% in control
households). The most common rea-
son for failure to collect information
was that study participants had tem-
porarily left the city to visit relatives.
There was a discrepancy between the
field worker’s record of diarrhea symp-
toms and the supervisor’s record in less
than 1% of supervisory visits.
At baseline, households in the 3 in-
terventiongroupswereofsimilarsizeand
socioeconomic status, had a compa-
rable number of young children, a simi-
lar proportion of whom were malnour-
ished, similar sources of water, sanitary
facilities, and reported hand soap pur-
chases (TABLE 1). Mothers reported
breastfeedingtheirchildrenyoungerthan
2yearsduring95%ofchild-weeksofob-
servationintheantibacterialsoapgroup,
95% in the plain soap group, and 94%
in the control group. Exclusive breast-
feeding was less common. Mothers re-
portedexclusivelybreastfeedingtheirin-
fants during 43% of infant-weeks of
observation in the antibacterial soap
group, 42% in the plain soap group, and
45% in the control group.
During the course of the study, hand-
washing promotion households re-
ceived a mean 3.3 bars of the study soap
per week; this translates into each
household resident using a mean 4.4 g/d
of soap.
Compared with children living in
control neighborhoods, children liv-
ing in households that received plain
soap and encouragement to wash their
hands had a 53% lower incidence of di-
arrhea (95% CI, –65% to –41%) and a
50% lower longitudinal prevalence of
diarrhea (95% CI, –65% to –35%;
TABLE 2). The incidence and longitu-
dinal prevalence of diarrhea among
households receiving antibacterial soap
was similar to households receiving
plain soap.
Themeandifferencesindiarrhearates
between handwashing promotion and
control neighborhoods were consis-
tent across most of the individual neigh-
borhoods (FIGURE 2). Indeed, the diar-
rhea incidence in 8 of 11 control
neighborhoods was higher than in any
of the handwashing promotion neigh-
borhoods.
For the first 8 weeks of the study, the
incidence of diarrhea was similar among
children living in handwashing promo-
tionneighborhoodscomparedwithchil-
dren in control neighborhoods. After 8
weeks, the incidence of diarrhea among
children living in handwashing promo-
tion neighborhoods was consistently
lower than children living in control
neighborhoods (FIGURE 3).
Diarrhea was more common among
younger children (6.2% longitudinal
prevalence among infants and 5.5%
amongchildrenaged1-2years)vsolder
children(3.3%amongchildrenaged2-5
years and 1.1% among children aged
5-15 years). Infants living in neighbor-
hoodswherehandwashingwasactively
promoted and in households that
receivedplainsoaphada39%lowerlon-
gitudinal prevalence of diarrhea (95%
CI, –61% to –16%) vs infants living in
controlneighborhoods(TABLE3).Chil-
dren older than 5 years living in house-
holdsthatreceivedplainsoaphada57%
reduction in diarrhea vs children liv-
ing in control neighborhoods (95% CI,
–73% to –41%). The age-specific lon-
gitudinal prevalence of diarrhea among
householdsreceivingantibacterialsoap
was similar to households receiving
plain soap.
Malnourished children had more di-
arrhea (5.3% and 4.8% prevalence
among children with severe and mod-
erate malnutrition vs 3.7% among chil-
dren without malnutrition). The effec-
tiveness of soap in preventing diarrhea
was independent of childrens’ nutri-
tional status. Among children younger
than 5 years living in households that
received plain soap and handwashing
promotion, those who were severely
malnourished had a 42% lower longi-
tudinal prevalence of diarrhea (95% CI,
–69% to –16%) and those who were
moderately malnourished had a 41%
lower longitudinal prevalence (95% CI,

rable age and nutrition status living in
control neighborhoods (TABLE 4). The
malnutrition-specificlongitudinalpreva-
lence of diarrhea among households re-
ceiving antibacterial soap was similar to
households receiving plain soap.
Compared with control neighbor-
hoods, children living in households
that received plain soap and hand-
washing promotion were 56% less
likely to visit a health care practitioner
for diarrhea (95% CI, –69% to –43%).
Hospitalization for diarrhea was
uncommon, occurring in only 0.23%
of the observed person-weeks. Chil-
dren living in households receiving
plain soap and handwashing promo-
tion were 26% less likely to be hospi-
talized for diarrhea but this difference
was not statistically significant (95%
CI, –100% to 66%). Only 5% of
observed episodes of diarrhea were
persistent diarrhea (ie, episodes lasting
14 days). Children living in house-
holds receiving plain soap and hand-
washing promotion were 31% less
likely to have a persistent episode of
diarrhea but this difference was not
statistically significant (95% CI, –70%
to 8%). The probability of visiting a
health care practitioner for diarrhea,
being hospitalized for diarrhea, and
having a persistent episode of diarrhea
was similar among households receiv-
ing antibacterial soap vs households
receiving plain soap (TABLE 5).
Seven children died during the study.
For 3 of the children, 1 from each of the
study groups, the mother reported that
the child had diarrhea as part of the ill-
ness that led to his/her death. These
deaths occurred in children aged 33, 36,
and 63 months. The diarrhea-specific
death rate was 1.6 deaths per 1000 chil-
dren younger than 5 years per year.
COMMENT
In these communities in which diar-
rhea is the leading cause of childhood
death, wash water was heavily contami-
nated with human fecal organisms, and
no provisions were made for clean dry-
ing of hands, handwashing promotion
with soap halved the burden of diar-
rheal disease. This study addressed
many of the methodological concerns
raised by previous reviewers of hy-
giene interventions.2,20 The interven-
tion was randomly assigned and in-
cluded a contemporaneous control
group. Diarrhea prevalence was simi-
lar at the beginning of the study be-
tween intervention and control groups.
The analysis accounted for the cluster
design of the intervention and had suf-
ficient power to evaluate the effective-
ness of the intervention in subgroups
of children at the highest risk of death
from diarrhea. The overall level of re-
duction in longitudinal prevalence of
diarrhea among children in house-
holds with handwashing promotion
(50% in the plain soap and 46% in the
antibacterial soap groups) was remark-
ably close to the 47% decrease calcu-
lated in the recent meta-analysis on the
effect of handwashing in preventing
diarrhea.2
Our study was not designed to evalu-
ate child mortality as an outcome. Only
3 children died from diarrhea during the
study, 1 from each group. Our rate of
deathfromdiarrheawas79%lowerthan
the diarrhea-specific death rate for chil-
dren younger than 5 years previously re-
ported from similar communities.15 The

family likely contributed to this low
death rate.
However, our study did have suffi-
cient power to evaluate the effective-
ness of handwashing promotion with
soap among children at high risk for
death from diarrhea. Important risk fac-
tors for diarrhea-specific death in de-
veloping countries include age younger
than1year,3-6,15malnutrition,9-11andper-
sistent diarrhea.10,12,13 In our study, in-
fants who were unable to wash their
hands had 39% fewer days of diarrhea
if they lived in households that re-
ceived plain soap and encouragement to
wash hands compared with control
households. This 39% reduction in di-
arrhea for infants was less than the 57%
reductionobservedamongchildrenaged
between 5 and 15 years who are able to
regularly wash their own hands.
Handwashing with soap removes
transient potentially pathogenic organ-
isms from hands.21,22 If individuals wash
their hands, they are less likely to trans-
mit pathogens from their hands to their
mouths. This mechanism benefits the
person washing his/her hands and is not
available to infants. However, persons
washing their hands are also less likely
to transfer pathogens from their hands
to the hands of others, or to food or the
environment that is shared with oth-
ers. Moreover, parents and siblings who
prevent their own episodes of diar-
rhea are less likely to shed pathogens
to the vulnerable infant’s environ-
ment. Our study findings suggest that
household handwashing interrupts
transmission of diarrheal pathogens suf-
ficiently to markedly reduce diarrhea
among infants.
Moderately or severely malnour-
ished children had as large a reduction
in diarrhea from improvement in house-
hold handwashing as children without
malnutrition. Although some reduc-
tion in persistent diarrhea (19%-31%)
was observed within households receiv-
ing soap and handwashing promotion,
persistent diarrhea was uncommon and
these reductions were not statistically
significant. Nevertheless, the effective-
ness of handwashing with soap in re-
ducingthelongitudinalprevalenceofdi-
arrhea among children at increased risk
ofdeathfromdiarrhea—infantsandmal-
nourishedchildren—suggeststhathand-
washingwithsoapwouldreducetherisk
of death from diarrhea.
We found no significant difference
in diarrheal disease among persons liv-
ing in households receiving antibacte-
rialsoapcomparedwithplainsoap.This
is not surprising because triclocarban
is a bacteriostatic agent that inhibits the
growth of some gram-positive bacte-
ria but is not effective against gram-
negative bacteria, viruses, or parasites
that cause infectious diarrhea.23,24
Thereareimportantlimitationstoour

ticipants were not blinded to the inter-
vention. It is possible that study partici-
pants in the handwashing promotion

mized reported episodes of diarrhea in

Asecondlimitationwasthatourstudy
was not originally undertaken to evalu-
ate the hypothesis that children at the
highest risk of death would benefit from
handwashing. We observed more diar-
rheathanweexpected.Diarrheawasun-
usually prevalent in Karachi in the sum-
mer of 2002, both as measured within
the study as well as by reports from lo-
cal clinicians. The incidence of diar-
rhea in the control group was more than
3timeshigherthanincontrolgroupswe
had observed in earlier studies in 2000
and 2001, which we used to estimate the
sample size. We further increased the
sample size to assess other outcomes.
Thus, sufficient observations for the
analysis of diarrhea among subgroups at
high risk of death were recorded. The
analysisandreportingofinterestingsub-
groups risks publication bias. How-
ever, the reduction in diarrheal disease
noted among infants and malnour-
ished children was not statistically
borderline. Moreover, there were 2 in-
tervention groups, plain soap and anti-
bacterial soap, and the findings from
both suggest a consistent phenomena.
A third limitation was that all of the
disease reduction in the intervention
communities was not necessarily attrib-
utable to improved handwashing. It is
possible that regular visits by field work-
ers, the provision of soap, and the suc-
cessfulimprovementinhandhygieneled
to other behavioral changes in house-
holds that reduced diarrheal disease.
However, the high soap consumption of
families suggests frequent handwash-
ing and field workers were specifically
trained to limit behavioral change mes-
sages to handwashing promotion. Thus,
improved handwashing likely played an
important role in reducing the inci-
dence of diarrhea.
Although visiting households weekly
to provide free soap and encourage
handwashing was effective in reduc-
ing diarrhea, this approach is prohibi-
tively expensive for widespread imple-
mentation. The next essential step is to
develop effective approaches to pro-
mote handwashing that cost less and
can be used to reach millions of at-
risk households. Studies evaluating the
durability of behavioral change from
handwashing promotion are also im-
portant to assess cost-effectiveness. In
the interim, existing public health pro-
grams should experiment with inte-
grating handwashing promotion into
their current activities.
