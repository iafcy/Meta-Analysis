An educational intervention was designed to improve three water-sanitation
behaviors empirically shown to be associated with high rates of childhood
diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh: lack of handwashing before preparing food, open
defecation by children in the family compound, and inattention to proper disposal
of garbage and feces, increasing the opportunity for young children to place
waste products in their mouth. Fifty-one communities, each comprising 38 fami-
lies, were randomized either to receive (n = 25) or not to receive (n = 26)
the intervention. During the six months after the intervention, the rate of diarrhea
(per 100 person-weeks) in children under six years of age was 4.3 in the
intervention communities and 5.8 in the control communities (26% protective
efficacy; p < 0.0001). A corresponding improvement in handwashing practices
before preparing food was noted, although no improvement was observed for
defecation and waste disposal practices. These data suggest that educational
interventions for water-sanitation practices can have an important beneficial
effect upon childhood diarrhea in developing countries, particularly when the
interventions are designed in a simple way to promote naturally occurring salutory
behaviors that are empirically associated with lower rates of childhood diarrhea.

tions declare the importance of education
in 
decreasing 
diarrheal 
disease (4),
Feachem (5) has noted that most studies
do not document this assertion. Even the
few 
studies 
that 
have 
demonstrated
changes in behavior after an educational
intervention have found no reduction (6)
or an insignificant reduction (7) in diar-
rheal disease. Several reviews have outlined
many of the methodological problems af-
fecting studies in this field (2, 8).
In a companion paper (9), we report on
the use of case-control methodology to de-
tect practices that are empirically associ-
ated with childhood diarrhea and that can
become a logical focus for interventions. In
that study, which included families from 51
slums in Dhaka, Bangladesh, practices as-
sociated with high rates of childhood diar-
rhea included open defecation in the living
areas by children, lack of maternal hand-
washing before preparing food, and inatten-
tion to proper disposal of garbage and feces,
with the result that young children had an
increased tendency to place waste products
in their mouth.
In the present study, we report on the
results of a randomized trial conducted in
the same 51 communities and designed to
modify these three targeted behaviors. The
results six months after implementation of
the intervention indicate a substantial re-
duction in the incidence of childhood diar-
rhea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
General Plan
Between October 1984 and January 1985,
we obtained information about socioeco-
nomic and demographic characteristics, be-
haviors related to water use and sanitation,
and rates of diarrhea in children under six
years of age in 51 communities in urban
Dhaka. From these observations, we devel-
oped an educational intervention intended
to improve three behaviors that appeared
to influence the incidence of diarrhea. The
same 51 communities were then random-
ized either to receive (n = 25) or not to
receive the intervention (n = 26). The in-
tervention 
was implemented 
between
March 6 and May 1, 1985, with periodic
revisits to reinforce its messages thereafter.
After the intervention, we obtained histo-
ries of childhood diarrhea and observed
water-sanitation behaviors. Rates of diar-
rhea and water-sanitation behaviors were
then compared in the intervention and
nonintervention communities for the six
months following implementation of the
intervention.
Selection and eligibility of communities and
families
We selected 51 sites from geographically
disparate impoverished areas of urban
Dhaka. Persons living in each site received
basic primary health care services from a
resident community health worker from the
Urban Volunteer Programme of the Inter-
national Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Re-
search, Bangladesh (10). From each of the
51 sites, we selected a "community," which
was defined as a cluster of 38 families oc-
cupying contiguous households beginning
five houses away from the home of the
community health worker. A family con-
sisted of persons residing together and
sharing the same cooking pot. The perim-
eters of seven of the communities lay within
one-half mile of the perimeter of the next
closest community, and three of the com-
munities were within sight of each other.
The remaining 41 communities were sepa-
rated by a distance of one to 12 miles. From
the 1,938 original families, 15 emigrated
before completion of the census at the be-
ginning of the study, so that the initial
population consisted of 1,923 families,
1,350 with children under six years of age.
In each community, five families having
at least one child aged under six years were
randomly chosen as "sentinel" families for
on-site observations of behaviors related to
water use and sanitary practices. Eight of
the 255 selected families refused observa-
tion or emigrated before the census, leaving
247 sentinel families at the outset of the
study. If a family emigrated from a com-
munity and another family subsequently

294
STANTON AND CLEMENS
occupied the vacated residence, the new
family was included in the study regardless
of the date of in-migration. Although this
eligibility procedure might have reduced
the apparent efficacy of the intervention by
including families that were absent for part
or all of the major educational program, we
included these in-migrant families because
we were interested in assessing the practi-
cal effectiveness of the intervention upon
communities, which are inherently dy-
namic demographic entities. On the other
hand, since behavioral observations before
and after the intervention were used to
assess whether the training had affected
behaviors among those fully participating
in the educational program, we did not
include for behavioral observations any
family that immigrated into the study area
after the intervention had begun.
Baseline observations
A census enumeration, including socio-
economic data for each family, was ob-
tained in September 1984. From October
1984 through February 1985, fortnightly
histories of diarrhea were obtained for chil-
dren of all families, and a single prolonged
on-site visit was made to the home of each
sentinel family for observation of water-
sanitation behaviors.
To obtain histories of diarrhea during the
baseline period, 13 trained interviewers
conducted fortnightly interviews of moth-
ers or caretakers to determine whether
their children aged under six years had had
an episode of diarrhea (defined as three or
more loose stools in any 24-hour period; see
comparison paper for full definition (9))
during the past two weeks. To improve the
accuracy of these histories, we encouraged
mothers to keep "calendars" to record epi-
sodes of diarrhea for each child. The cal-
endars were specially designed for use by
illiterate adults. Supervisors made frequent
unannounced spot checks to verify the ac-
curacy of the histories.
For the observation of water-sanitation
behaviors, a trained field research officer
made an unannounced visit once during the
baseline period to each sentinel family.
Each visit began in the early morning and
lasted from three to five hours. A highly
structured data instrument was used to en-
sure systematic notation of observations.
The five field officers responsible for the
visits were assigned to families in a ran-
domized fashion to safeguard against bias
that might have occurred if the temporal
order of visits for different clusters varied
in a systematic fashion. Moreover, two su-
pervisors made unannounced, random spot
checks of the observations to verify com-
pleteness and accuracy of the observations.
Intervention
Formulation of the intervention. As de-
scribed in detail elsewhere (9), a compari-
son of the practices of sentinel families with
high rates of childhood diarrhea versus the
practices of sentinel families with low rates
of childhood diarrhea during the baseline
period revealed only three behaviors to be
associated with childhood diarrhea: fail-
ure of mothers to wash their hands before
preparing food; defecation by young chil-
dren in the living area of the family; and
inattention to proper disposal of garbage
and feces from the living area. From these
observations, we developed three educa-
tional messages emphasizing proper hand-
washing before food preparation, defeca-
tion away from the house and in a proper
site, and suitable disposal of waste and
feces, thus preventing access to waste prod-
ucts by young children.
Allocation of the intervention. Because of
the small number of communities allocated
to the intervention and control groups, and
the consequent possibility that randomi-
zation per se might fail to equalize baseline
risks of childhood diarrhea in the compared
groups, we employed stratified randomiza-
tion. We first ranked the 51 communities
from highest to lowest according to their
age-adjusted rates of childhood diarrhea.
We then grouped the ordered communities
into 25 adjacent pairs and one remaining
community (having the lowest rate). The

DEVELOPMENT OF WATER-SANITATION EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION
295
pairs each comprised a stratum. Within
each stratum, one community was assigned
to the intervention group and one to the
control group with use of a random number
table. For the one unpaired community,
allocation was also random.
Implementation of educational interven-
tion. The three messages formed the basis
of an intensive training program conducted
for eight weeks in 25 communities. Seven
experienced trainers working with the au-
thors and a local nontraditional educa-
tional facility, Village Education Resource
Center, developed an educational program.
The intervention approach included small-
group discussions including only women or
only children, larger demonstrations to
mixed audiences, and community-wide
planning and action meetings which in-
cluded husbands. The training was con-
ducted by the trainers and the 25 Urban
Volunteer Programme community health
workers living next to the 25 intervention
communities. Posters made by the trainers
and the community members, games, pic-
torial stories, and "flexiflans" (a flannel
board with movable characters) (11) were
developed to illustrate the messages.
Following the eight weeks of intensive
training, one trainer and the community
health workers continued to reinforce the
educational message through new stories,
games, and community organization in all
25 communities. The 26 community health
workers in the nonintervention communi-
ties continued to provide the primary
health care services cited earlier (10).
Assessment of outcomes
Beginning two weeks after initiation of
the intervention, we evaluated the impact
of the intervention upon observed hygienic
practices and the incidence of childhood
diarrhea for the next six months (March 20
through September 20, 1985). Utilizing the
format described for the baseline period, we
made one on-site behavioral observation
for each sentinel family and obtained fort-
nightly histories of diarrhea for all children.
Analysis of data
Statistical comparisons of categorical
baseline variables were made with use of
the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test
where appropriate. Comparisons of dimen-
sional baseline variables employed the
Mann-Whitney U test. To express the as-
sociation between the intervention and the
incidence of childhood diarrhea, we calcu-
lated incidence density ratios. A ratio of
one corresponded to no association; values
less than one corresponded to reduction in
the incidence of diarrhea in the interven-
tion group (e.g., protection); and values
greater than one denoted an excess of diar-
rhea cases in the intervention group. The
value (one minus incidence density ratio)
denoted the proportionate reduction in
diarrhea attributable to the interven-
tion (e.g., protective efficacy). Precision-
weighted incidence density ratios were cal-
culated to summarize values over several
strata; levels of significance and 95 per cent
confidence intervals for incidence density
ratios were calculated by standard tech-
niques (12). To assess the effect of the
stratified randomized allocation of the 51
communites to the intervention and control
groups, we performed separate analyses,
preserving the paired-community strata
and using the above techniques to derive
summary incidence density ratios and as-
sociated levels of significance.
Because clusters of individuals rather
than individuals per se were the units of
randomization and hence the appropriate
units of analysis, we also compared inci-
dence rates of diarrhea of the intervention
and control communities according to the
matched-pair strata with the Wilcoxon
matched-pairs test, treating the incidence
rate of each community as a single obser-
vation rather than a group of observations
(13). This tactic yielded a very conservative
estimate of statistical significance, since it
estimated the variance of incidence rates
by treating communities as single observa-
tions and since, as a nonparametric test, it
made no distributional assumptions. Fi-

nally, to examine the correlation of the
magnitude of the incidence density ratio
for each matched pair, on the one hand,
with the incidence of diarrhea in the control
community for the pair, on the other hand,
we calculated Spearman's rho. All p values
were interpreted in a two-tailed fashion.
RESULTS
Comparability of intervention and control
areas in the baseline period
Table 1 shows the comparative demo-
graphic and socioeconomic profiles of the
937 intervention families and 986 control
families in the 51 communities. Family size,
ages of children, levels of education, family
income, ownership of property, type of
house construction, and access to sanita-
tion facilities were similar. Before the in-
tervention, the rates of diarrhea in the two
groups were nearly identical, as were the
frequencies of behavioral practices that
were to be the focus of the intervention.
Comparison of hygienic practices after the
intervention
After the intervention, significantly more
mothers washed their hands before prepar-
ing food in the intervention areas (39/79
(49 per cent)) than in the nonintervention
areas (25/75 (33 per cent)) (p < 0.05).
There was no decrease in open defecation
in the living area by ambulatory children
(intervention 18/27 (67 per cent), nonin-
tervention 12/19 (63 per cent)). Although
the number of households with uncovered
garbage or feces in the compounds did not
differ (intervention 46/81 (57 per cent),
nonintervention 41/76 (54 per cent)) and
the number of households in which children

by the conservative Wilcoxon matched-
pairs test.
Examination of the data in table 4 re-
vealed a significant inverse correlation be-
tween the incidence density ratio for each
matched pair and the incidence of diarrhea
for the control community of the pair
(Spearman's rho = -0.45; p < 0.05). If the
incidence of diarrhea for each control com-
munity can be taken as an estimate of the
incidence for its matched intervention com-
munity in lieu of the intervention, this cor-
relation suggests that the magnitude of the
intervention's protective effect varies di-
rectly with the incidence of diarrhea in the
community in which the intervention is
imposed.
DISCUSSION
Our results suggest that a simple educa-
tional message designed to alter behaviors
empirically associated with childhood diar-
rhea can both modify behavioral practices
and lower rates of diarrheal disease. The
fact that the reduction in diarrhea, while
present for all age groups, was most marked
in children aged two and three years per-
haps reflects the diminished importance of

DEVELOPMENT OF WATER-SANITATION EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION

maternal handwashing and clean immedi-
ate surroundings for infants and very young
children, most of whom are breast-fed and
are nonambulatory, and for highly ambu-
latory older children who have extensive
contact with environments outside their
family compounds. Chance occurrence, in-
adequate delivery of the educational mes-
sage, and poor community compliance are
all plausible explanations for the lack of
success in those community pairs in which
rates of diarrhea were not improved by the
intervention.
Blum and Feachem (8) have outlined
many of the weaknesses of the current wa-
ter and sanitation literature, including lack
of controls, inadequate account of con-
founding 
variables, simple 
one-to-one
community comparisons, nonconcurrent
comparisons, inadequate monitoring of be-
havioral change, ambiguous definitions of
diarrhea, and inadequate indicator recall.
Because the present study randomly as-
signed the intervention and control regi-
mens to numerous distinctive communities,
with demonstrable comparability of the in-
tervention and control groups at baseline,
and because the intervention and control
groups were followed concurrently after
randomization, we believe that the study
employed adequate safeguards 
against
biases that may have weakened past studies
(14). Moreover, we also monitored behav-
ioral outcomes, provided explicit defini-
tions of episodes of diarrhea, and attempted
to enhance the validity of histories of diar-
rhea by use of home-maintained health cal-
endars (15).
Potential limitations of the study
Certain other problems, however, war-
rant consideration. This study was not per-
formed in a double-blinded fashion. Nev-
ertheless, we attempted to avoid detection
bias by using separate personnel for imple-
menting the intervention and for observing
the effects of the intervention, and by pro-
viding no incentive to the research person-
nel or study population to report rates of
diarrhea that would reflect success of the
intervention. Also arguing against bias was
the lack of effect of the intervention on
rates of diarrhea in certain ages (four and
five years), as well as on scabies, which was
simultaneously monitored after the inter-
vention and whose occurrence bears no log-
ical relationship to the intervention (B.
Stanton, unpublished observations). That
only one of the three behavioral practices
differed after the intervention also suggests
that reporter bias by the research team was
unlikely, since such selective misreporting
would be most unlikely. Finally, the results
obtained for routine two-week diarrhea re-
calls by the interviewers and by unan-
nounced, independent, verification visits by
supervisors showed a high level of concor-
dance, which was similar for the interven-
tion and control communities.
Biases could also have resulted from the
high rate of migration observed in the ur-
ban study areas, with the potential for dif-
ferential migration patterns in the inter-
vention and control communities. After the
initial census enumeration, equivalent per-
centages of intervention and control com-
munities immigrated (19 per cent in inter-
vention communities vs. 23 per cent in
control communities) or emigrated (38 per
cent in intervention communities vs. 37 per
cent in control communites). The demo-
graphic characteristics and rates of child-
hood diarrhea during the baseline period
were similar in the compared groups for
both emigrant and immigrant families.
Moreover, restricting the analysis to only
those persons originally enrolled in the
study produced similar postintervention
rates of diarrhea (intervention communi-
ties: 4.16 episodes per 100 weeks; noninter-
vention communities: 5.65 episodes per 100
weeks, p < 0.0001). It is therefore difficult
for us to attribute the apparent impact of
the intervention to migration bias.
Because the control and intervention
groups were followed concurrently and be-
cause water-sanitation behaviors and rates
of diarrhea were comparable at baseline for
the two groups, we assessed the impact of
the intervention upon behavioral patterns

and rates of diarrhea by focusing exclu-
sively on events occurring after onset of the
intervention. At the same time, it might
seem anomalous that the improvement in
handwashing behavior after the interven-
tion resulted from a lesser deterioration of
handwashing practices relative to baseline
in the intervention communities than in
the control communities. Similarly, it could
also be pointed out that relative to baseline,
rates of diarrhea decreased in both groups,
but to a greater extent in the intervention
group. These observations illustrate the fal-
lacy of nonconcurrent comparisons in
countries such as Bangladesh, where
marked seasonal changes occur for rates of
diarrhea and associated behavioral prac-
tices. The transition from the baseline pe-
riod to the postintervention period in this
study coincided with the onset of the mon-
soon season, when flooding covers available
taps and tubewells in many parts of the
city and generally impedes access to sources
of putatively clean water. This seasonal
change may be responsible for the general
decrease in handwashing for both the in-
tervention and control communities. By
contrast, heavy rains, which wash away
debris, may have resulted in the overall
decrease in environmental garbage seen
during this period compared with the dry
season.
Next, although unannounced spot checks
were made to verify the accuracy of the
recording of observations, no attempt was
made to determine the consistency of be-
haviors in a given household from one day
to the next. Such fluctuations in behavior
undoubtedly occurred, thereby diminishing
the sensitivity of single observations for
detecting postintervention alterations in
behavior. Thus, while it is possible that the
decrease in diarrhea observed in the inter-
vention communities was due solely to
changes in handwashing practices, it may
be that our observational tool was too in-
sensitive to detect corresponding changes
in other behaviors.
Finally, while no specific attempt was
made to monitor for "spillover" of the ed-
ucational message from intervention to
control communities, the distance and large
numbers of persons separating communi-
ties made such an occurrence unlikely.
Moreover, such contamination would have
lessened the measured impact of the inter-
vention and would have constituted a major
concern only if the study had failed to find
an effect.
Implications of the findings
Although consistent with logical expec-
tation, our results are more striking than
results from previously reported educa-
tional interventions. In addition to differ-
ences in experimental design, there are sev-
eral possible explanations for the magni-
tude of protection observed in this study.
With some obvious exceptions (7), the
training approach utilized has rarely been
described in detail in published reports of
water and sanitation interventions (16).
Whether this absence reflects simple omis-
sion or a more fundamental lack of atten-
tion to the educational component of the
interventions cannot be determined. In the
present study, we devoted considerable at-
tention to the delivery of our educational
program. We attempted to include com-
munity members in all stages of the pro-
gram, and we addressed the recognition of
the importance of different audiences and
the necessity of being able to respond to
organized community requests (17,18). We
attempted to use materials that were de-
veloped for a largely uneducated audience
and that involved audience participation
(11) and to involve the community in iden-
tifying both the needs of and solutions to
their health problems (17).
Nevertheless, some studies have de-
scribed an elaborate and appropriate train-
ing approach (7), and others have described
behavioral changes that suggest that the
training used was appropriate (6). Yet,
these studies did not demonstrate sig-
nificant decreases in diarrheal disease. We
suggest that this may be because the edu-
cational programs offered too many prohi-
bitions and recommendations and were

developed without specific attention to em-
pirical associations with disease or to the
acceptability of the recommendations. The
results from this study both validate the
usefulness of empiric behavior-diarrhea as-
sociations detected in a case-control study
(9) and illustrate the substantial impact of
an appropriately conceived educational in-
tervention upon childhood diarrhea in im-
poverished settings.
