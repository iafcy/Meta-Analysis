Summary
Background Poor nutrition and exposure to faecal contamination are associated with diarrhoea and growth faltering, 
both of which have long-term consequences for child health. We aimed to assess whether water, sanitation, 
handwashing, and nutrition interventions reduced diarrhoea or growth faltering.
Methods The WASH Benefits cluster-randomised trial enrolled pregnant women from villages in rural Kenya and 
evaluated outcomes at 1 year and 2 years of follow-up. Geographically-adjacent clusters were block-randomised to 
active control (household visits to measure mid-upper-arm circumference), passive control (data collection only), or 
compound-level interventions including household visits to promote target behaviours: drinking chlorinated water 
(water); safe sanitation consisting of disposing faeces in an improved latrine (sanitation); handwashing with soap 
(handwashing); combined water, sanitation, and handwashing; counselling on appropriate maternal, infant, and 
young child feeding plus small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements from 6–24 months (nutrition); and 
combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition. Primary outcomes were caregiver-reported diarrhoea in the 
past 7 days and length-for-age Z score at year 2 in index children born to the enrolled pregnant women. Masking was 
not possible for data collection, but analyses were masked. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01704105.
Findings Between Nov 27, 2012, and May 21, 2014, 8246 women in 702 clusters were enrolled and randomly assigned 
an intervention or control group. 1919 women were assigned to the active control group; 938 to passive control; 904 to 
water; 892 to sanitation; 917 to handwashing; 912 to combined water, sanitation, and handwashing; 843 to nutrition; 
and 921 to combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition. Data on diarrhoea at year 1 or year 2 were available 
for 6494 children and data on length-for-age Z score in year 2 were available for 6583 children (86% of living children 
were measured at year 2). Adherence indicators for sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition were more than 70% at 
year 1, handwashing fell to less than 25% at year 2, and for water was less than 45% at year 1 and less than 25% at 
year 2; combined groups were comparable to single groups. None of the interventions reduced diarrhoea prevalence 
compared with the active control. Compared with active control (length-for-age Z score –1·54) children in nutrition 
and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition were taller by year 2 (mean difference 0·13 [95% CI 
0·01–0·25] in the nutrition group; 0·16 [0·05–0·27] in the combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition 
group). The individual water, sanitation, and handwashing groups, and combined water, sanitation, and handwashing 
group had no effect on linear growth.
Interpretation Behaviour change messaging combined with technologically simple interventions such as water 
treatment, household sanitation upgrades from unimproved to improved latrines, and handwashing stations did not 
reduce childhood diarrhoea or improve growth, even when adherence was at least as high as has been achieved by other 
programmes. Counselling and supplementation in the nutrition group and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, 
and nutrition interventions led to small growth benefits, but there was no advantage to integrating water, sanitation, and 
handwashing with nutrition. The interventions might have been more efficacious with higher adherence or in an 
environment with lower baseline sanitation coverage, especially in this context of high diarrhoea prevalence.

Introduction
An estimated 156 million children worldwide suffer from 
stunting (linear growth faltering) and are unlikely to 
reach their full potential as adults.1 Linear growth faltering 
is the most apparent sign of chronic undernutrition and 
is the physical manifestation of combined physiological 
and developmental insults. Early-life stunting leads to 
poor cognitive development in childhood, reduced

economic productivity in adulthood, and increased risk of 
morbidity and mortality.2,3 Because nutrient supple­
mentation and counselling interventions for maternal, 
infant, and young child feeding have been only marginally 
successful at preventing growth faltering, exposure to 
faecal contamination in the environment has recently 
been hypothesised to lead to environmental enteric 
dysfunction, which features chronic immune stimulation 
and impaired nutrient absorption, thereby constraining a 
growth response to improved nutrition.4 In addition to 
the detrimental effects on growth and development, 
under­nutrition was estimated to cause 45% of all 
child deaths in 2011, and it has long been recognised 
that undernutrition is an important determinant of 
susceptibility to infectious disease.5,6 Diarrhoea is the 
second leading cause of death in children aged 
1–59 months, contributing to almost 500 000 deaths in 
children younger than 5 years in 2015.7 Frequent diarrhoea 
is also associated with linear growth faltering.8 If there is 
a pathway independent of symptomatic diarrhoea linking 
environmental contamination to growth faltering, the 
benefits of improving water safety, sanitation, and 
handwashing could be underestimated because studies 
have generally focused on diarrhoea. It is unclear whether 
combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional 
interventions reduce diarrhoea or improve growth more 
than single interventions.
We aimed to investigate whether individual water, 
sanitation, handwashing, or nutrition interventions can 
reduce linear growth faltering; to assess whether 
combined water, sanitation, and handwashing inter­
ventions are more effective at reducing diarrhoea than 
individual interventions; and to investigate whether the 
combination of water, sanitation, handwashing, and 
nutrition inter­ventions reduces growth faltering more 
than each individual intervention. A companion trial9 in 
Bangladesh evaluated the same objectives.
Methods
Study design
The Kenya WASH Benefits study was a cluster-
randomised trial done in rural villages in Bungoma, 
Kakamega, and Vihiga counties in Kenya’s western region 
(appendix p 11). We used a cluster design to facilitate the 
logistics of the behaviour change component of the 
interventions and minimise contamination between 
intervention and comparison households. We hypo­
thesised that the interventions would improve the health 
of the index child in each household. We optimised the 
trial design to measure group-level differences in primary 
outcomes by including a large number of clusters, each 
comprising relatively few children (12 on average) with 
infrequent measurement. Each measurement round 
lasted roughly 1 year and was balanced across treatment

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Malnutrition and enteric infection are thought to act together 
to impair child health and survival, yet there is limited evidence 
of low cost, scalable interventions effective at breaking this 
cycle. A 2008 meta-analysis by Dewey and Adu-Afarwuah 
found that interventions offering nutrient supplementation or 
counselling on complementary feeding could result in modest 
improvements to child growth. Another meta-analysis by 
Waddington and Snilsveit in 2009 showed that water 
treatment or handwashing could prevent diarrhoea, but there 
had not been any randomised trials of the effect of sanitation 
on diarrhoea. During this study, five other randomised trials of 
the effects of sanitation on diarrhoea and growth were 
published, but three were limited by low adherence. Whether 
combining water, sanitation, handwashing, or nutrition 
interventions could result in added benefits for health and 
growth was not known.
Added value of this study
This trial is one of the first to provide experimental evidence on 
whether individual and combined water, sanitation, or 
handwashing interventions improve growth; combined water, 
sanitation, and handwashing interventions are more effective 
at reducing diarrhoea and growth faltering than any 
intervention alone; and nutrition counselling and 
supplementation are more effective when combined with 
improved water, sanitation, and handwashing. This is the first 
rigorous evaluation of upgrading from unimproved to 
improved latrines in sub-Saharan Africa. None of the 
interventions reduced diarrhoea, and only the interventions 
that included nutrition counselling and nutrient 
supplementation improved growth.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results on growth effects are consistent with those from 
previous research on the combination of nutrition counselling 
and nutrient supplementation, finding modest effects on linear 
growth. It is possible that more intensive promotion and higher 
adherence would have resulted in larger effects, especially in this 
context of high diarrhoea prevalence, but few programmes are 
likely to be able to afford sustaining a more ambitious behaviour 
change programme than was included in this trial. In a context 
where most households already had an unimproved sanitation 
facility, provision of technologically simple interventions 
including chlorination for household treatment of drinking water, 
improved pit latrines, and handwashing stations—standard for 
most WASH programmes in rural areas of low-income countries—
might not be sufficient to improve growth. By contrast with 
previous studies, this trial provided evidence that technologically 
simple water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions with 
adherence rates at least as high as most programmes achieve 
might not reduce childhood diarrhoea in all situations.

groups and geography to minimise seasonal or geo­
graphic confounding when comparing outcomes across 
groups.
With active and passive control groups and six 
intervention groups (water; sanitation; handwashing; 
combined water, sanitation, and handwashing; nutrition; 
and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and 
nutrition), the design enabled 11 comparisons of each 
intervention group with the active control; combined 
water, sanitation, and handwashing with each intervention 
alone; and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and 
nutrition with nutrition alone, and combined water, 
sanitation, and handwashing. A double-sized active control 
group was used to increase power because there were six 
separate intervention comparisons against control.10 
Households in the active control and all intervention 
groups were visited by community-based health promoters 
monthly to measure the child’s mid-upper arm 
circumference. Health promoters did not visit households 
in passive control clusters. Measurement of outcomes, as 
well as water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition 
characteristics were measured in the passive control group 
at the same times as in other groups. The study design and 
rationale have been published previously.10
The study protocol was approved by the Committee for 
the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of 
California, Berkeley (protocol number 2011-09-3654), the 
institutional review board at Stanford University 
(IRB-23310), and the scientific and ethics review unit at 
the Kenya Medical Research Institute (protocol number 
SSC-2271). Under direction of the study investigators, 
Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) was responsible for 
intervention delivery and data collection.
Participants
Villages were eligible for selection into the study if they 
were rural, most of the population relied on communal 
water sources and had unimproved sanitation facilities, 
and there were no other ongoing water, sanitation, 
handwashing, or nutrition programmes. Participants 
were identified through a complete census of eligible 
villages. Within selected villages, women were eligible to 
participate if they reported that they were in their second 
or third trimester of pregnancy, planned to continue to 
live at their current residence for the next 2 years, and 
could speak Kiswahili, Luhya, or English well enough to 
respond to an interviewer administered survey. IPA staff 
formed clusters from one to three neighbouring villages 
to have six or more pregnant women per cluster after the 
enrolment survey. Outcomes were assessed in the 
children born from these pregnancies (index children), 
including twins. Although the study area is one of the 
areas with the highest HIV prevalence in Kenya, 
according to the 2012 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey, the 
prevalence in women aged 15–64 years in the study area 
was below 6% (that survey did not include testing of 
children). Because there would not have been sufficient 
sample size to allow for subgroup analysis by HIV status, 
no attempt was made to identify participants who were 
HIV positive. Participants gave written informed consent 
before enrolment.
Randomisation and masking
Clusters were randomly allocated to treatment using a 
random number generator with reproducible seed at 
the University of California, Berkeley. Groups of nine 
geographically-adjacent clusters were block-randomised 
into a double-sized active control; passive control; water; 
sanitation; handwashing; water, sanitation, and hand­
washing; nutrition; or water, sanitation, handwashing, 
and nutrition. Allocation by cluster identification number 
was communicated directly to the field team; investigators 
remained blinded to treatment assignments. Blinding of 
participants was not possible. Participants were informed 
of their treatment assignment after baseline data 
collection and might have known the treatment 
assignment of nearby villages. The health promoters and 
staff who delivered the interventions were not involved in 
data collection, but the data collection team could have 
inferred treatment status if they saw intervention 
materials in study communities.
Procedures
The interventions were designed to maximise adherence 
to behaviours that could protect children from exposure to 
pathogens in their environment and improve diet quality. 
Formative research in the study area concluded that the 
health benefits of target behaviours were already well 
understood, but this knowledge was not sufficient to lead 
to action. As such, the behaviour change strategy and 
intervention materials were selected to create enabling 
environments, build supportive social norms, and target 
emotional drivers of decision making. The messages and 
delivery modes for the behaviour change strategy drew 
from existing information, education, and communication 
materials from organisations such as WHO, the Kenyan 
Government, UNICEF, and the Alive and Thrive network, 
and extensive previous qualitative work on the drivers 
of handwashing behaviours. Monthly visit modules 
were developed and pilot-tested to provide behavioural 
recommendations to mothers and other caregivers using 
key thematic constructs of convenience, nurturing care, 
and aspiration. We did a pilot randomised controlled trial11 
to test the feasibility and acceptability of all the interventions 
and to collect data that allowed us to optimise the ratio of 
community-based promoters to study participants. To 
identify and correct systematic problems with adherence, 
staff confirmed that intervention materials were delivered 
to all study participants at the outset of the trial, and 
collected monitoring data on availability of interv­
ention materials and recommended behaviours during 
unannounced visits to a random sample of at least 20% of 
participants in intervention groups 2, 6, 10, and 19 months 
after the interventions began.

Community-based promoters for intervention and 
active control groups were nominated by study mothers 
and other mothers of children younger than 3 years in the 
community. A second promoter was added if there were 
more than ten participants (single groups) or more than 
eight participants (combined groups) in the cluster, giving 
a total of 1031 promoters. Promoters attended 2 days 
(active control), 6 days (single groups), or 7 days (combined 
groups) of initial training led by study staff on how to 
measure mid-upper-arm circumference, communication 
skills, intervention-specific behaviour change messages 
and intervention materials, and the information they were 
expected to report to IPA. Refresher trainings were done 
6, 12, and 18 months after the initial training. At 2, 4, 9, 15, 
and 21 months, study staff met with promoters in their 
clusters to observe visits and offer supportive supervision. 
Study staff called promoters monthly to collect information 
on their activities, intervention adherence in the 
households they visited, referrals to health centres, and 
births or deaths of study children. Promoters received a 
branded T-shirt, a mobile phone, job aids and intervention 
materials, and compensation of approximately US$15 per 
month for the first 6 months when they had more 
intensive engagement with the study participants, and 
$9 per month thereafter (the prevailing daily wage for 
unskilled labour in the study area is $1–2). Promoters 
were instructed to visit all participants in their cluster 
monthly and measure the child’s arm circumference or 
the pregnant mother’s abdomen.
In intervention groups, promoters engaged study 
participants and other compound members through 
interactive activities such as guided discussions using 
visual aids, song, and storytelling; resupplied consumable 
intervention materials; encouraged consistent practice of 
targeted behaviours; and helped troubleshoot barriers 
to adherence, including problems with intervention 
hardware and behavioural barriers. Promoters were 
provided with detailed plans for every visit, including key 
messages, scripts for discussing visual aids, and 
instructions for activities that emphasised the learning 
objectives. Visits lasted about 10 min in the active control 
group and 45–60 min in intervention groups during the 
first year when the key messages were conveyed. In the 
second year, promoters reinforced messages to maintain 
habits. All groups used messages on themes of nurture, 
aspiration, and self-efficacy, particularly in the context of 
a new birth. Interventions used convenience and social 
norms to encourage target behaviours.
In the three intervention groups that included water, 
promoters advocated treatment of drinking water with 
sodium hypochlorite. Chlorine dispensers for convenient 
water treatment at the point of collection were installed 
at an average of five communal water sources in 
the cluster and refilled as needed. Every 6 months, 
households in study compounds were given a 1 L bottle 
of chlorine for point-of-use water treatment in case 
households collected rainwater or used a source without 
a dispenser. Promoters used chlorine test strips during 
their regular visits to determine if the household was 
using 
chlorine, 
and 
negative 
results 
stimulated 
conversation about addressing barriers to chlorination.
In the three intervention groups that included 
sanitation, promoters advocated using latrines for 
defecation and safe disposal of children’s and animals’ 
faeces into a latrine. Existing unimproved latrines in 
study households were upgraded to improved latrines by 
installing a plastic slab, which also had a tight-fitting lid 
over the hole. New latrines were constructed for study 
households that did not have a latrine or whose latrine 
was unlikely to last for 2 years. All households in study 
compounds received a sani-scoop with a paddle as a 
dedicated faeces-removal tool. Finally, all households 
with children younger than 3 years in study compounds 
received plastic potties to facilitate toilet training and 
transfer of child faeces to the latrine.
In the three intervention groups that included 
handwashing, promoters advocated handwashing with 
soap before handling food and after defecation 
(including assisting a child). Study compounds were 
given two permanent, water-frugal handwashing stations 
intended to be installed near the food preparation area 
and the latrine. Handwashing stations were constructed 
of painted metal, with two foot-pedal-operated jerry-cans 
that dispensed a light flow of rinse water and soapy 
water. Promoters added chunks of bar soap to the soapy 
water container quarterly.
In the two intervention groups that included nutrition, a 
set of ten age-targeted modules were developed to enable 
promoters to advocate for best practices in maternal, 
infant, and young child feeding: recommend­ations for 
dietary diversity during pregnancy and lactation, early 
initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding until 
6 months, introduction of appropriate and diverse 
complementary foods at 6 months, and continued 
breastfeeding through 24 months. Facilitators and barriers 
to behaviour change were elicited using formative 
research and health promoter guides were developed to 
address common barriers and questions. Study mothers 
with children between 6–24 months were provided with 
two 10 g sachets per day of a small quantity of lipid-based 
nutrient supplement (LNS; Nutriset; Malauny, France) 
that could be mixed into the child’s food. LNS provided 
118 kcal per day and 12 essential vitamins and ten minerals. 
Promoters explained that LNS was not to replace 
breastfeeding or comple­mentary foods.
Promoters and intervention materials were introduced 
at community meetings roughly 6 weeks after enrolment. 
All interventions were delivered within 3 months of 
enrolment (appendix p 1). LNS was introduced to each 
child when they turned 6 months old. All handwashing 
stations and latrines were inspected within a month of 
construction, and a subset of households was periodically 
visited to observe group-specific indicators of intervention 
adherence. These data alerted study investigators to any

issues with intervention implementation so they could 
be addressed consistently across all clusters and groups.
The enrolment survey included baseline demographics; 
assets; water, sanitation, and handwashing infrastructure; 
and target behaviours. Follow-up at 1 year and 2 years 
after intervention delivery consisted of an unannounced 
visit to study compounds to observe objective indicators 
of target behaviours (in all groups other than the passive 
control) and, on the following day, growth and health 
outcome measurements at a central location in the 
cluster (eg, a church or school).
Children identified as possibly malnourished (mid-
upper-arm circumference <11·5 cm), either by the 
promoter during routine visits or by study staff during 
follow-up measurements, were referred to health 
facilities for treatment.
Outcomes
Adherence to the interventions was assessed using 
objective, observable indicators where possible (appendix 
pp 2, 3). We calculated Z scores for length for age, weight 
for length, weight for age, and head circumference for

age using the WHO 2006 child growth standards. All 
child deaths reported by the health promoters were 
confirmed by a staff nurse who visited households. All 
outcomes were prespecified. Primary outcomes were 
caregiver-reported diarrhoea in the past 7 days (based on 
all data from year 1 and year 2) and length-for-age Z score 
at year 2 in index children. Secondary and tertiary 
outcomes reported in this paper are length-for-age 
Z score at year 1; weight-for-length Z score, weight-for-age 
Z score, head circumference-for-age Z score at year 1 and 
year 2; prevalence of stunting (length-for-age Z score less 
than –2), severe stunting (length-for-age Z score less 
than –3), wasting (weight-for-length Z score less than –2), 
and underweight (weight-for-age Z score less than –2); 
and all-cause mortality. We excluded children from 
Z-score analyses if their measurements were outside 
biologically 
plausible 
ranges 
following 
WHO 
recommendations. More details on exclusion criteria, 
measurement protocols, and outcome definitions are in 
the appendix (p 1).
Statistical analyses
Sample size calculations for the two primary outcomes 
were based on a minimum detectable effect of 0·15 in 
length-for-age Z score (intracluster correlation of 0·02 in 
our pilot study) and a relative risk of diarrhoea of 0·7 or 
smaller (assuming a 7-day prevalence of 12% in the active 
control group based on a pilot study to inform this trial) 
for a comparison of any intervention with the double-
sized control group, assuming a type I error (α) of 0·05 
and power (1–β) of 0·8, a one-sided test for a two-sample 
comparison of means, and 10% loss to follow-up.10,11 
Sample size calculations indicated 80 clusters per group, 
each with ten children.
Two biostatisticians, blinded to treatment assignment, 
independently replicated the analyses following the 
prespecified analysis plan with minor updates.10 We 
analysed participants according to their randomised 
assignment (intention to treat), regardless of adherence 
to the intervention, using the active control group 
as the comparator. We used paired t tests for 
unadjusted length-for-age Z score comparisons and the 
Mantel-Haenszel prevalence ratio and difference for 
unadjusted diarrhoea and stunting comparisons, with 
randomisation 
block 
defining 
matched 
pairs 
or 
stratification. In secondary analyses, we estimated 
prevalence ratios and differences, adjusting for baseline 
covariates using targeted maximum likelihood esti­
mation.12 Analyses were done in R (version 3.2.3). We 
tested for the presence of between-cluster spillover 
effects using a non-parametric method described in the 
prespecified analysis plan, which tested whether primary 
outcomes were the same in control households with 
more versus fewer households receiving interventions 
within a 2 km radius. In an analysis that was not 
prespecified, we tested for intervention effects on 
diarrhoea using only year 1 data.
The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT01704105. IPA convened a data and safety monitor­
ing board.
Role of the funding source
The funders of the study approved the study design, 
but had no role in data collection, data analysis, 
data interpretation, or writing of the report. The 
corresponding author had full access to all the data in 
the study and had final responsibility for the decision to 
submit for publication.
Results
2569 villages were assessed for eligibility, of which 
606 were excluded on the basis of village-level 
characteristics (primarily not meeting the study’s rural 
criteria). 1226 villages were grouped into 702 clusters that 
had six or more pregnant women (figure 1). Between 
Nov 27, 2012, and May 21, 2014, 8246 pregnant women 
were enrolled in the study. 281 women did not have a 
livebirth and 140 women delivered twins. After at least 
three attempts to measure each child, 6659 (86%) of 
7780 surviving children were measured at year 2, with 
diarrhoea reports for 6494 children and length-for-age 
Z score measures for 6583 children. Children were aged 
2–18 months (median 12 months) at 1-year follow-up 
(January, 2014, to June, 2015) and aged 16–31 months 
(median 25 months) at 2-year follow-up (February, 2015, 
to July, 2016), but 11 184 (87%) of 12 841 children were in 
the target age ranges of 9–15 months at year 1 and 
21–27 months at year 2 (appendix p 12).
Household characteristics were similar across groups 
at enrolment (table 1). Roughly three-quarters of partici­
pants collected drinking water from an improved source, 
but had to walk at least 10 min on average to the source. 
Over 80% of households owned a latrine, but less than 
20% had access to an improved latrine. Less than 15% of 
households had soap available at a handwashing location. 
The prevalence of moderate-to-severe household hunger 
was 12% or lower.
Around 75% of households were visited by their promoter 
within the past month at year 1, but frequency of contact 
fell by year 2, with 40% or fewer households reporting a 
visit in the past month in each group (monitoring data 
suggest that most households were still visited at least every 
other month during the second year of the trial; see details 
in the appendix p 2, and table 2). Slightly less than half of 
households had detectable free chlorine in stored drinking 
water in the water group. Around 40% of drinking water 
samples tested in the water, sanitation, handwashing, and 
nutrition group had detectable free chlorine at year 1, which 
fell to around 20% by year 2. A high proportion of 
households (75%) had improved latrine access, which 
remained stable in year 1 and year 2 in households in the 
sanitation groups, increasing by more than 50% compared 
with the active control group. Reported safe disposal of 
children’s faeces into a latrine fell by roughly half in all

groups between year 1 and year 2, although the practice 
remained over twice as likely in the groups that included 
sanitation compared with other groups at year 1 and year 2. 
More than 75% of households in the intervention groups 
that included handwashing had water and soap available at 
a handwashing location at year 1, but this indicator also 
fell to about 20% by year 2. Adherence to LNS 
recommendations was high (≥95%) at year 1 and year 2, 
with children consuming a few more LNS sachets per 
month on average than would be expected at year 2. Across 
all indicators, adherence was comparable between the 
water, sanitation, and handwashing group and the water, 
sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition group compared 
with single intervention groups.

Diarrhoea prevalence over the past 7 days (combining 
data from year 1 and year 2) was 27·1% in children in 
the active control group (figure 2, table 3). The 
intracluster correlation for diarrhoea was 0·012. 
Compared with the active control group, the diarrhoea 
prevalence ratios across all groups were not signifi­
cantly different from one and differences were not 
significantly different from zero (figure 2, table 3). 
Diarrhoea prevalence was the same in the combined 
water, sanitation, and handwashing group and the 
individual water, sanitation, and handwashing groups. 
Although adherence to the water and handwashing 
interventions was higher in year 1 than in year 2, in an 
analysis that was not prespecified, diarrhoea prevalence 
was not significantly lower in any of the intervention 
groups at year 1 (appendix p 12). The high diarrhoea 
prevalence was fairly stable over 2 years of follow-up 
and there were no apparent seasonal trends (appendix 
p 13). Although we had prespecified a sensitivity analysis 
by age group of child at year 2, we did not complete this 
analysis because sample sizes in the age group strata 
were smaller than expected.
By year 2, when children were between 16 and 
31 months old (median 25 months), mean length-for-age 
Z score in children in the active control group was –1·54 
(SD 1·11; figure 3). The intracluster correlation for 
length-for-age Z score was 0·037. Compared with the 
active control group, only nutrition and combined water, 
sani­tation, handwashing, and nutrition had higher 
length-for-­age Z score (mean difference in score 0·13 
[95% CI 0·01–0·25] for nutrition; 0·16 [0·05–0·27] for 
combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition; 
figure 3). Children in the combined water, sanitation, 
handwashing, and nutrition group were not significantly 
taller than children in the nutrition group (mean 
difference 0·04 [95% CI –0·11 to 0·19]; figure 3). Most 
length-for-age Z score gains in these two groups 
were already apparent by year 1 (0·11 [–0·01 to 0·22] 
for nutrition; 0·12 [0·01–0·22] for combined water, 
sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition; appendix p 14).

Mean weight-for-age Z score at year 2 was higher in 
children in the nutrition and combined water, sanitation, 
handwashing, and nutrition groups than the mean of 
–0·72 (SD 1·01) in the active control group (table 4). 
Children in the active control group were close to 
WHO standards for weight-for-length Z score; however, 
weight-for-length Z score at year 2 was higher in the 
combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition 
group (table 4). There were no differences in mean head 
circumference for age Z score at year 2 between children 
in any of the intervention groups and those in the active 
control group. Results were similar at year 1, with the 
exception that differences in mean weight-for-length 
Z score between the active control and two groups with 
the nutrition intervention appear to have been numerically 
larger at year 1 (appendix p 15).
Compared with the active control group, a smaller 
proportion of children in the combined water, sanitation, 
handwashing, and nutrition group were stunted (too short 
for their age; –5·4 percentage points [95% CI –9·4 to –1·4]), 
severely stunted (–2·7 percentage points [–5·1 to –0·2]), or 
underweight (–3·0 percentage points [–5·4 to –0·6]; 
table 5); no other groups appeared to affect these 
outcomes. Notably, there were no significant differences 
between the combined water, sanitation, handwashing, 
and nutrition and nutrition groups for any growth 
outcomes. 1% of active control children were wasted and 
the proportions were similar across all groups.
Differences in growth outcomes between the active 
control and intervention groups were similar in 
magnitude and precision when estimated using adjusted 
models (appendix pp 16–19). We found no evidence of 
between-cluster spillover effects (appendix p 20).
The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was 
3·9% in the active control and ranged from 5·3% in the 
handwashing group to 2·8% in the combined water, 
sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition group; none of 
the differences between intervention groups and the 
active control were statistically significant at α=0·05 
(figure 1, appendix p 21).

water quality, safe sanitation, handwashing, nutrition, or 
combinations of the interventions) on caregiver-reported 
diarrhoea prevalence during the first 2 years of life, and 
improvements in growth were only observed in groups 
including the nutrition intervention (maternal, infant, 
and young child feeding counselling and LNS 
distribution). With a large sample size and high-quality 
anthropometric measurements, this trial was powered 
to detect small effects in diarrhoea prevalence and 
length-for-age Z score had they been present. Lower 
adherence to the water and handwashing interventions 
by the end of the 2 years of intervention does not seem to 
be the only explanation for the absence of benefits: there 
were also no reductions in diarrhoea or improvements in 
growth in children in the water, handwashing, sanitation, 
or combined water, sanitation, and handwashing groups 
even in the first year (a typical measurement point in 
previous trials), when community-based promoters were 
most active and adherence was higher, whereas almost 
all of the growth benefits in the nutrition group and 
combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition 
group were already manifest in the first year. Adherence

to the interventions was comparable to or better 
than what a government or large non-governmental 
organisation might hope to achieve at scale (appendix 
p 22), with increases in adherence indicators of 
30 percentage points or higher in all intervention 
groups relative to the control in the first year.
These findings contrast with several systematic 
reviews13–15 that have found significant protective benefits 
of water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions (including 
handwashing) on diarrhoea in efficacy trials, although 
most of these studies were shorter and had higher 
adherence. Results from other trials16–18 also showed no 
effect of improved sanitation on diarrhoea, although 
differences in contexts and interventions complicate 
comparisons between these trials. Our trial differed from 
previous trials in that the intervention shifted households 
from unimproved sanitation (rather than open defecation) 
to improved sanitation. Additionally, the prevalence of 
diarrhoea in this study population was high, consistent 
with prevalence in 12–23-month-old infants measured in 
the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey.19
A systematic review and meta-analysis20 of the effects 
of water quality and supply, sanitation, and hygiene 
interventions to improve growth identified only five 
randomised controlled trials of water or handwashing 
interventions, which did not suggest strong effects on 
growth, perhaps in part because the interventions lasted 
only 9–12 months. Since then, five more randomised 
trials of sanitation interventions have generated mixed 
evidence on child growth effects: two trials done in India 
and one in Indonesia had low adherence and no effect, 
and two done in settings with high rates of open 
defecation in India and Mali showed improvements in 
length-for-age Z score of 0·18–0·40 in children younger 
than 5 years.16–18,20–22 The sanitation intervention in our 
trial was aligned with the focus on improved latrines 
initiated under the Millennium Development Goals, and 
the Sustainable Development Goals’ recognition that 
children’s faeces also need to be safely disposed of. This 
trial and its companion trial9 in Bangladesh suggest that 
a compound-level approach to upgrading existing latrines 
and safely disposing of children’s faeces is not sufficient

to improve child growth, and neither are water and 
handwashing interventions.
Conversely, counselling and LNS provided in the 
nutrition group improved length-for-age Z score by year 2. 
Compared with randomised controlled trials of LNS during 
complementary feeding, our finding of length-for-age 
Z score improvements of 0·13–0·16 in the nutrition groups 
falls in the middle of the spectrum between four trials: one 
from Malawi23 that reported no effect on length-for-age 
Z score, one from Haiti24 and one from Bangladesh25 that 
reported an effect on length-for-age Z score comparable to 
this study, and one from Burkina Faso26 that reported a 
larger effect on length-for-age Z score. Thus, there appears 
to be consistent evidence that LNS distribution together 
with some promotion of improved infant and young child 
feeding can reduce growth faltering, although this approach 
falls far short of eliminating the problem. Interventions 
will likely need to address the complex set of underlying 
determinants of growth faltering, including prenatal or 
preconception factors. Future analyses will explore changes 
in feeding practices that resulted from the intervention.

than in the nutrition versus active control group, the 
differences were of little clinical or statistical significance. 
We conclude that combining nutrition with water, 
sanitation, and handwashing did not provide additional 
growth benefits beyond nutrition alone. Although the 
effect of water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition 
on mortality was not significant, the lower mortality in 
that group is consistent with the statistically significant 
effect of water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition 
on mortality in the Bangladesh trial.9 Pending analyses 
will evaluate potential differences in effects on other 
child health outcomes.
It is possible that the water, sanitation, and 
handwashing interventions delivered in this trial did not 
sufficiently address important transmission routes for 
enteric pathogens.11 Although the sanitation intervention 
included a sani-scoop and messages about preventing 
children from being exposed to domestic animal faeces, 
the emphasis was mostly on behaviours related to human 
faeces and might not have protected children from 
zoonotic pathogens.27 Although chlorination of water has 
the advantage of providing residual protection against 
recontamination, it is not effective against protozoa such 
as Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium spp, the latter of 
which was identified as one of the most common causes 
of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children 0–23 months 
in a neighbouring part of Kenya.28 Other limitations 
of this trial include the inability to mask the inter­
ventions; the absence of observable indicators of 
actual behaviour for the handwashing, sanitation, and 
nutrition interventions; lower adherence to the water and 
hygiene interventions during the second year of the trial 
than in the first year; and the use of a compound-level 
sanitation intervention, as opposed to community-level. 
Because masking was not possible, we focused on 
objective, observable indicators when­ever possible rather 
than self-reported behaviours, recognising that the 
availability of a latrine or hand­washing station stocked 
with water and soap does not necessarily imply that the 
materials were used. Despite an intensive design process 
that drew heavily on best practices in behaviour change, 
incorporation of lessons learned from the pilot 
randomised controlled trial, thorough verification of 
availability of the intervention materials, and periodic 
monitoring of indicators of recommended behaviours, 
adherence to the water and handwashing interventions 
appeared to reduce sharply in the last months of the trial. 
The waning intensity of promotion activities after a 
reduction in the stipend given to the health promoters 
could at least partly explain the drop in adherence. 
Finally, by contrast with water, handwashing, and 
nutrition interventions that directly benefit households 
that adhere to the intervention, a sanitation intervention 
in only a subset of compounds might not be sufficient to 
protect against exposure to faecal contamination in the 
environ­ment that originates from other compounds in 
the community. We decided, however, to deliver 
compound-level interventions based on evidence that 
child exposure to enteric pathogens during the first 
2 years of life occurs predominantly within the household 
com­pound.29 Because environmental contamination and 
disease transmission pathways could be different in 
densely populated contexts, similar studies in urban 
areas would complement this rural trial.
Additional outcome measures collected in this trial 
will help to elucidate potential mechanisms for the 
observed effects, including indicators of environ­­
mental contamination, environmental enteric dys­
function, anaemia, enteric parasite infection, and child 
development. Molecular measurement of infections in 
the laboratory with stored stool specimens collected as 
part of this trial offer an opportunity for unbiased 
indicators of pathogen burden. 
More intensive promotion and higher adherence could 
have resulted in larger effects than those reported, but our 
findings are relevant for large-scale programmes that 
struggle to achieve adherence rates as high as those of 
efficacy studies. The potential for water, sanitation, 
hygiene, and nutrition interventions to reduce diarrhoea 
and improve growth might be highly context-dependent. 
In our rural setting, water was plentiful but rarely available 
on premises, susceptible to contamination at the source 
and in storage, and rarely treated despite introduction 
of a nearly-universal filter distribution programme;30 
unimproved latrine coverage was high and there was a 
culture of using sanitation facilities for defecation by 
human beings, but there was probably persistent exposure 
to animal faeces; handwashing was not a common 
practice; breastfeeding was common, but exclusive 
breastfeeding was not, and most people had enough food, 
but not a diverse diet; diarrhoea prevalence was high; and 
many children had low length-for-age Z score, but not 
weight-for-length Z score. Our findings call into question 
the ability of large-scale water, sanitation, and hand­
washing interventions to reduce diarrhoea or improve 
growth. Our results suggest that integrated water, 
sanitation, and handwashing and nutrition programmes 
are no more effective than nutrition programmes at 
reducing diarrhoea or improving growth, and that 
nutritional interventions that include counselling and 
LNS can modestly reduce growth faltering, but fall short 
of eliminating it, even when LNS adherence is high.
Contributors
