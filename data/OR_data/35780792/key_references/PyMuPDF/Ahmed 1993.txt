Abstract-A 
community-based 
intervention 
was developed 
through 
direct 
participation 
of the target 
population 
in assessment 
and iterative 
trials 
to improve 
hygiene 
practices 
and to reduce 
childhood 
diarrhoea 
in lowland 
rural Bangladesh. 
A total of 185 (98X) households 
with children 
ages O-18 months 
in five contiguous 
villages were targeted 
for the interventions. 
A comparison 
site was selected for a detailed 
observational 
study and for use as a control 
for the intervention. 
About 
97% of all households 
with 
children 
ages l&l8 months 
were enrolled 
for study at the control 
site. Children 
in this age group 
were 
targeted 
because 
at this developmental 
stage they were most vulnerable 
to diarrhoeal 
morbidity 
and 
malnutrition 
(related 
to unhygienic 
practices). 
The intervention 
was implemented 
with the assistance 
of 
village leaders through 
a “Clean 
Life” campaign 
by local project workers 
and volunteer 
mothers 
who were 
chosen 
from the target 
households. 
The intervention 
activities 
started 
in January 
1986 and lasted for 7 
months. 
Higher 
adoption 
rates of the intervention 
were associated 
with better cleanliness 
status, 
which 
was related to lower diarrhoea 
and malnutrition 
rates in the intervention 
site. The results of between-site 
longitudinal 
analyses 
showed 
that after the intervention, 
the intervention 
site had substantially 
higher 
cleanliness 
scores, lower diarrhoeal 
morbidity, 
and better growth 
status compared 
to those of the control 
site, with differences 
increasing 
over time. 
The findings 
suggest 
that 
this type of community-based 
intervention 
can be very beneficial in modifying 
hygiene behaviours 
and lowering childhood 
diarrhoea 
and 
malnutrition.

INTRODUCTION 
Diarrhoea 
is a leading 
cause 
of morbidity 
and mor- 
tality 
among 
children 
in the world 
[l], and 
has 
adverse effects on growth 
[24]. 
In Bangladesh, 
it is 
estimated 
that diarrhoea 
accounts 
for up to 60% of 
deaths 
among 
the 14 year age group 
[5] and that 
90% of preschool 
children suffer from some degree of 
malnutrition 
[6]. The 
malnutrition 
and 
mortality 
rates of children of Bangladesh 
are among the highest 
in the world 
[7]. In Bangladesh, 
as many 
other 
countries, 
diarrhoea 
is a major contributor 
to malnu- 
trition 
[8] and child mortality 
[5, 91. Poor 
hygiene 
practices 
and 
environmental 
sanitation 
are major 
contributors 
to diarrhoea 
[IO]. 
In developing 
countries, 
most 
hygiene 
interven- 
tions 
to reduce 
diarrhoea 
have been found 
to be 
either 
ineffective, 
unfeasible, 
inappropriate, 
or too 
costly [l 1, 121, having been developed 
without 
exam- 
ining the cultural 
context. 
These interventions 
wc3re 
alien to the local situation 
[12] and did not meet the 
real need 
of the people 
[13, 141. In contrast, 
the 
intervention 
activities 
described 
here were developed 
and implemented 
in rural Bangladesh 
by involving 
the villagers through 
a community-based 
trial model 
[ 151. The objective of the interventions 
was to reduce 
childhood 
diarrhoea 
by 
modifying 
hygiene 
be- 
haviours, 
using solutions 
from within the community. 
Many studies evaluate the effect of interventions 
by 
comparing 
pre-post 
differences 
in intervention 
and 
control 
groups without 
examining 
seasonal 
patterns 
of change 
over time. In contrast, 
this paper reports 
changes 
in 
daily 
rates 
of 
childhood 
diarrhoea, 
monthly 
cleanliness 
practices, 
and nutritional 
status 
in both intervention 
and control 
communities. 
This 
study also investigates 
the relationship 
between 
the 
rates 
of adoption 
of the intervention 
and 
health 
indicators 
within 
the intervention 
site in order 
to 
understand 
how the intervention 
may have affected 
the outcomes. 
METHODS 
Sites and target 
population 
Longitudinal 
research 
was 
conducted 
from 
November 
1985 to July 1986 in two rural sites, each 
consisting 
of five contiguous 
villages situated 
on the 
northern 
bank 
of the Padma 
River in Manikgonj 
District, 
100 km northwest 
of Dhaka. This low-lying 
159 

160 
NASAR U. AHMED Ed al. 
area was selected for the program 
because of its poor 
hygiene 
conditions 
and high diarrhoea 
and malnu- 
trition 
rates [16]. Environmental 
sanitation, 
personal 
cleanliness, 
and 
food 
hygiene 
were 
difficult 
year 
round. 
These problems 
were aggravated 
by lack of 
water 
in the hot dry season 
(April-May) 
and too 
much 
water 
in the flood 
season 
(July-September). 
The intervention 
and comparison 
sites were se- 
lected based on similarities 
in ecological 
and demo- 
graphic 
characteristics, 
cultural 
practices, 
child care, 
and hygiene and sanitation 
behaviours. 
The interven- 
tion site was 5 km away from 
the control 
site and 
accessible 
by a 2-hr boat ride most of the year, and 
by foot over narrow foot paths in about 1.5 hr during 
the driest months. 
At the time of the study, there were 
no other developmental 
projects 
in these sites. At the 
control 
site, a detailed 
observational 
study [ 171 with- 
out intervention 
exposed 
the villagers 
to about 
the 
same amount 
of contact 
with researchers. 
The inter- 
vention 
was implemented 
in the poorer 
and 
less 
hygienic 
of the two sites in order 
to increase 
the 
probability 
that observed 
conservative 
results would 
be attributable 
to intervention. 
Following 
baseline 
surveys 
at the two 
sites 
in 
August 
and September, 
a census 
was conducted 
in 
October, 
1985 in five selected 
villages at each site to 
enlist the families with children 
below 19 months 
of 
age who 
were 
targeted 
for 
intervention 
and 
for 
structured 
observational 
study. This census was also 
used to collect 
socioeconomic 
and demographic 
in- 
formation 
of the target 
households. 
Initially, 
the 
intervention 
site had 194 families comprising 
98% of 
all households 
with children 
under 19 months, 
while 
the control 
site had 193, or 97%, of all the targeted 
families. Nine deaths and eight children 
who left the 
area subsequently 
reduced 
the sample to 185 in each 
site. 
Field methods 
One Tufts doctoral 
candidate 
in nutrition 
and one 
local Master’s 
degree research 
assistant/field 
supervi- 
sor lived at each site for the duration 
of the study 
during 
which 
they trained 
and supervised 
IO field 
workers 
at each site. These paid workers 
were high- 
school 
graduates 
from 
the study 
communities 
se- 
lected for their interest and ability to work in the field. 
At each site, two of the workers were specially trained 
for anthropometry, 
two for morbidity 
surveillance 
and one for data coding. 
Five workers 
were respon- 
sible for implementing, 
organizing, 
and facilitating 
the campaign 
activities 
in the intervention 
site, while 
five others conducted 
structured 
observations 
in the 
control 
site. In the intervention 
site, the field workers, 
research assistant. 
and doctoral 
candidate 
became the 
working group who communally 
discussed, 
tried, and 
decided 
upon interventions. 
Anthropometry 
began 
in November, 
1985 and 
formal 
morbidity 
surveillance 
in February, 
1986. 
Preliminary 
qualitative 
research 
started in November 
and 
the community-based 
intervention 
process 
in 
January, 
1986. The campaign 
in the entire commu- 
nity began in February. 
The cleanliness 
observations 
were conducted 
three times per household 
in March, 
June, and July, 1986. 
The intervention 
The intervention 
was developed 
and implemented 
through 
a campaign 
called “Porichchhanna 
Jibon” 
(clean life). First, rapport 
was established 
with village 
leaders, who were in a position 
either to facilitate 
or 
to resist changes 
in their villages. Several discussions 
were organized 
with leaders 
and 
local officials 
to 
explain the project in order to seek full co-operation. 
Lectures 
were then delivered 
to the villagers at the 
weekly Friday 
prayer gathering 
at the mosque. 
This 
occasion 
was chosen 
because the majority 
(83%) of 
the households 
were Muslim. 
As the Islamic leaders 
stress cleanliness 
as an essential part of their faith, the 
project also emphasized 
cleanliness 
as a common 
goal 
in order 
to gain wider acceptance 
of the clean life 
campaign. 
A community-based 
trial 
model 
described 
elsc- 
where in detail [I 51 was used to develop interventions. 
In brief, first specific hygiene 
practices 
and sanitary 
conditions 
associated 
with diarrhoea, 
as well as cul- 
tural 
beliefs 
regarding 
causes 
of diarrhoea, 
were 
identified 
through 
a rapid 
assessment 
survey, 
field 
observations, 
in-home 
problem 
diagnosis, 
and focus 
group discussions 
with the community. 
The project 
working 
group met to assess commu- 
nity 
resources 
to use in the intervention 
and 
to 
generate 
ideas for new hygiene practices and products 
for the trials. All proposed 
behaviours 
and products 
were tested 
and revised 
through 
iterative 
in-home 
trials 
at three 
levels: 
the 
10 project 
workers; 
25 
volunteer 
mothers; 
and 25 of the poorest 
community 
mothers. 
The project workers 
trained and supervised 
the 
community 
volunteer 
mothers, 
who 
in turn 
taught 
the rest of the mothers 
in the community. 
New hygiene behaviours 
and products 
that proved 
feasible in the project 
workers’ 
trials were then tried 
by the volunteers. 
The results were synthesized, 
with 
successful 
behavioural 
advice translated 
into simple 
action 
messages 
based on locally popular 
proverbs. 
poems, 
and folk songs. 
Final pre-testing 
and minor 
revisions 
in the messages 
took place in the trials with 
the poorest 
mothers 
during the education 
campaign 
u51. 
Campaign strategy 
The intervention 
site was divided 
into five geo- 
graphical 
blocks. 
For 
each 
block, 
five volunteer 
mothers 
and one worker were responsible 
for teach- 
ing the other community 
mothers 
in their neighbor- 
hoods in groups of three to five, at least twice a week. 
The small group was chosen to ensure active involve- 
ment 
of each mother 
in group 
activities. 
For 
the 
group 
discussions, 
mothers 
chose 
their 
least 
busy 
time, usually in the late morning 
or late afternoon. 
The teaching 
approach 
was participatory, 
emphasiz- 

Diarrhoeal intervention in rural Bangladesh 
161 
ing questions 
and answers and discussion 
among the 
volunteer 
and community 
mothers. 
In the sessions, 
they learned 
from each others’ contributions. 
The germ theory 
of disease was taught 
as a first 
step, in order to develop an understanding 
about the 
transmission 
of disease, as most people believed that 
the origins 
of diarrhoea 
were the “evil eye”, “bad 
air”, spirits, teething, 
or too early introduction 
of the 
adult 
diet. 
In addition, 
some 
considered 
that 
the 
child’s 
eating 
its own feces helped 
teeth 
to come 
through 
in the teething 
process; 
only 4% of mothers 
had heard 
about 
germs [15]. The mothers 
were en- 
couraged 
to identify 
their problems 
in light of what 
they learned about transmission 
of germs and to find 
their own solutions 
through 
group participation 
and 
discussions. 
The volunteers 
usually initiated 
the dis- 
cussions 
by asking 
mothers 
to identify 
the biggest 
health 
problem 
in the village. 
“Diarrhoea” 
was a 
commmon 
response. 
The issues brought 
up typically 
related 
to cleanliness 
and hygiene. 
Next, 
they ex- 
plored possible 
causes and solutions 
to the problems 
based on the mothers’ 
thinking 
and talking. Hygiene 
and 
sanitation 
behaviours 
were 
actively 
demon- 
strated 
by the volunteers, 
and taken 
up by group 
participation 
so as to dramatize 
how these behaviours 
affect health. 
They also discussed 
ways to protect 
people 
from 
diseases. 
The mothers 
were receptive, 
and messages 
were presented 
theme by theme to be 
integrated 
into their daily lives. 
The following 
interventions 
were developed, 
im- 
plemented, 
and adopted 
in the community. 
Theme I: Ground Sanitation-keeping 
babies from 
touching and eating disease-causing matter on the dirt 
surface of the compound 
(1) Sweep the baby’s play area four times a day. 
(2) Use a dirt thrower 
(similar 
to a flat garden 
trowel 
provided 
by the 
project 
at US $0.30) to 
immediately 
remove the baby’s or animal feces from 
the compound 
surface, 
so that the crawling 
baby 
could not be contaminated 
by feces from the ground. 
(3) Construct 
a feces pit to dispose 
of feces and 
other filthy matter from the compound. 
The feces pit 
was about 
2 ft deep, with a narrow 
neck. 
(4) Wash babies in a particular 
place after defeca- 
tion so that germ-contaminated 
water did not spread 
everywhere. 
(5) Keep 
crawling 
babies 
in a playpen 
(locally 
constructed, 
provided 
by the project at a cost of US 
$1 .OO) instead of permitting 
them to crawl in the dirt. 
Theme II: Personal Hygiene-reducing 
the trans- 
mission of germs from defecation and other personal 
hygiene behaviours 
(1) Wash parent’s 
and child’s hands with ashes or 
soap 
after 
defecation 
as well as before 
and after 
feeding or eating. 
(2) Use the “bodna” 
(water pitcher used for clean- 
ing after defecation) 
with the right hand only so that 
the germs from the left hand (used for cleaning after 
defecation) 
do not contaminate 
the bodna 
for the 
next user. 
(3) Clean the baby immediately 
after defecation 
so 
that the baby could not be contaminated 
with his/her 
feces. 
(4) Use a razor blade to cut the nails of all family 
members, 
including 
babies, 
at least 
once a week. 
Since the custom 
in Bangladesh 
is to eat with the 
hand, long nails can regularly transport 
germs to the 
mouth. 
(5) Use a clean hand rag to dry the mother’s 
hands 
after defecation 
instead 
of using her own sari. 
(6) Clean 
the 
baby 
rug 
or 
mat 
immediately 
whenever 
it becomes 
soiled so that the baby would 
not come into contact 
with dirty matter. 
Theme III: Food Hygiene-reducing 
the transmission 
of germs during supplementary and bottle feeding 
(1) Do not use any feeding 
bottles 
(small brown 
medicine 
bottles 
were used) if possible. 
(2) If using a bottle, 
soak it in strong 
salt water 
and/or wash it in hot water and boil the nipple before 
feeding. 
(3) Prepare only the quantity 
of bottle mixture that 
the baby 
could 
drink 
at one time. 
Mothers 
were 
taught 
that germs would contaminate 
any left-over 
bottle mixture. 
(4) Use only tubewell 
water for drinking 
and for 
mixing food for baby. 
(5) Wash both caretaker’s 
and child’s hands 
and 
eating plates with tubewell water before eating. Wash 
both hands and utensils before food preparation. 
(6) Do not feed left-over 
food 
which 
might 
be 
contaminated. 
(7) Keep all food covered from flies, dirt, chickens 
and dogs. 
(8) Store clean plates 
and pots and pans upside 
down or covering 
them to keep animals 
off. 
(9) Cover water pitchers 
(storage 
vessels) so that 
animals 
or flies could not contaminate 
the drinking 
water. 
Data collection 
Data were gathered 
during home visits by the two 
field workers 
who were not involved 
in the interven- 
tion activities. 
Socioeconomic 
and demographic 
data 
were obtained 
from 
the household 
head 
or other 
responsible 
adult. The child’s age was determined 
by 
discussion 
among 
family members 
based on a local 
festivals and events calendar 
and the date(s) of birth 
of the nearest 
sibling(s). 
The mother’s 
day-by-day 
recall 
of illness 
was 
recorded 
by two 
morbidity 
workers, 
who 
visited 
households 
weekly 
in serial 
order 
from 
February 
to July. Each worker 
visited 
each mother 
on alternate 
weeks to limit interviewer 
bias. 
During 
their 
weekly 
home 
visits, 
the morbidity 
investigators 
administered 
a monitoring 
question- 
naire 
with 
questions 
regarding 
awareness, 
under- 
standing 
of benefits, 
and adoption 
of each message.

designated 
by the mother 
as the places

she usually 
put the baby down 
to play. An 
overall 
cleanliness 
scale was the average 
cleanliness 
score for the ground, 
child’s face, child’s hands and 
mother’s 
sari. 
The cleanliness 
of hands, 
face, and clothes 
of the 
child, the mother’s 
sari, and the play areas of chil- 
dren were observed 
by the morbidity 
workers 
and 
rated 
on a three-point 
scale, which was condensed 
for analysis to I if completely 
clean and 0 otherwise. 
Satisfactory 
Cronbach’s 
alpha 
values 
( > 0.57) 
showed 
internal 
consistency 
for 
the 
household 
wealth, 
agricultural 
wealth, 
understanding, 
adop- 
tion, 
ground 
cleanliness, 
and 
overall 
cleanliness 
scales. 
Anthropometric 
measurements 
were 
obtained 
through 
visiting 
each 
home 
on approximately 
the 
same date of each month, 
except to return 
to cover 
children 
absent 
during 
regular 
visits. 
Two 
field 
workers 
were trained 
and their measurements 
stan- 
dardized 
for all anthropometric 
techniques 
accord- 
ing to the Zerfas 
Method 
[18]. The child’s 
weight 
was recorded 
to the nearest 
0.1 kg using 
a beam 
scale 
and 
length 
to 
the 
nearest 
0.1 cm 
using 
a 
measuring 
board 
as specified 
by WHO [19]. 
The 
definition 
of diarrhoea 
was influenced 
by 
liquid breastmilk 
stool [20]. At the end of the study, 
more than 90% of the children 
were still breastfed. 
During the 5 months 
of instrument 
pretesting 
at the 
observation 
site [21], it was concluded 
that many 
breastfed 
subjects 
had five or more 
soft or liquid 
breastmilk 
stools 
per day 
that 
were 
nevertheless 
normal, 
and considered 
normal 
by their 
mothers, 
who did not seem to remember 
the exact frequency 
of these stools. 
Data collection 
throughout 
was supervised 
by a 
senior member 
of the research 
team with a supervi- 
sor 
to 
interviewer 
ratio 
of 
1 :2. 
Records 
were 
checked 
in the field, each evening, 
for inaccuracy, 
inconsistency 
or missing data and every attempt 
was 
made to reobtain 
incomplete 
or inaccurate 
data the 
following 
day using the data control 
worker 
whose 
schedule 
was not fixed. 
Therefore, 
mothers 
were asked to recall the pres- 
ence or absence 
of diarrhoea 
according 
to their own 
perceptions. 
If diarrhoea 
was reported, 
the mother 
was asked 
if the stool 
was: softer 
than usual. 
1-5 
stools; 
watery, 
l-5 
stools; 
softer 
than 
usual, 
5510 
stools; 
watery, 
5-10 stools; 
watery 
more 
than 
10 
stools per day; or dysentery. 
Measuws 
Frequency 
distributions 
of the responses 
showed 
almost 
no occurrence 
in categories 
with more than 
five stools. 
Therefore, 
diarrhoea 
was recategorized 
into two levels: any diarrhoea 
and severe diarrhoea 
(all reported 
watery 
stools and dysentery). 
Household 
wealth 
and agricultural 
wealth 
scales 
were 
created 
for each 
household, 
replicating 
the 
model 
derived 
from 
factor 
analysis 
by a previous 
study 
[17] using 
the same data 
set. In the scales, 
items 
were assigned 
monetary 
value 
according 
to 
their 
local market 
prices, 
added 
together, 
and di- 
vided by household 
size to obtain a per capita value. 
The agricultural 
wealth 
consisted 
of land, poultry, 
goats. cows, henhouses. 
cowshed, 
out-buildings 
and 
agricultural 
equipment; 
household 
wealth 
consisted 
of houses, 
beds. 
mats, 
pillows. 
brass/bronze 
pots. 
aluminum 
pots. cooking 
pots, kitchen. 
bicycles. 
and 
umbrellas. 
Prevelance 
for any and for severe diarrhoea 
were 
calculated. 
Daily prevalence 
was defined 
as number 
of children 
sick with diarrhoea 
over total children 
observed, 
expressed 
as a percent. 
Weight-for-Age-Z-scores

MONTH OF OBSERVATION 
Fig. 2. Motherxhild 
pairs and playarea 
rated clean 
1985, and ranged 
from 0 to 19 months. 
Age distri- 
butions of the children 
by month were similar in both 
sites. 
The intervention 
site was similar to the control 
site 
in the following 
variables: 
mother’s 
age, father’s age, 
radio ownership, 
source of drinking 
water, and dis- 
tance between the latrine and the children’s 
play area. 
The intervention 
site, however, 
had more 
Muslims 
(83% vs 57%) and fewer mothers 
who had attended 
school 
(13% vs 25%). In the intervention 
site, only 
one mother 
had completed 
10 years 
of education 
compared 
to ten mothers 
in the control 
site. The 
father’s education 
was also lower in the intervention 
site (31% vs 49% school attendance). 
About 
half as 
many intervention 
as control 
fathers 
had 10 or more 
years of education. 
The intervention 
site had a larger 
percentage 
of households 
owning 
land and animals 
and employed 
in agriculture 
and fishing. The control 
site had more salaried 
jobs, 
traders 
and craftsmen, 
and better 
housing 
with 
fewer 
persons 
per room. 
Though 
the control 
site was also very rural, it bor- 
dered on the upazilla (subdistrict) 
center, where there 
were small offices, an open market, 
schools, 
a rural 
health center and a 3-bed hospital. 
Between -site comparison 
The intervention 
began in the community 
in Febru- 
ary and continued 
through 
to July. The measures 
taken 
in February 
are considered 
initial and those 
taken in July are final measures. 
Cleanliness and sanitation 
Table 
2 presents 
the individual 
observations 
of 
cleanliness 
of children, 
mothers, 
and play areas at 
three points of intervention, 
whereas 
Figure 2 shows 
the 
percentages 
of 
households 
in 
which 
the 
child-mother 
pairs 
and the play areas 
were rated 
completely 
clean. 
It illustrates 
a dramatic 
improve- 
ment in cleanliness 
at the intervention 
site. Table 2 
shows that in March, the intervention 
site cleanliness 
rates were lower than or similar to the rates in the 
control 
site except in the cleanliness 
of the children’s 

Diarrhoeal 
intervention

165 
faces. 
At the end of the study 
period, 
cleanliness 
indicators 
in the intervention 
site differed 
dramati- 
cally from the control 
site. Cleanliness 
of children’s 
faces and the play areas increased 
in both the sites; 
however, 
far greater 
increases 
were observed 
in the 
intervention 
site compared 
to the control 
site. 
Diarrhoeal morbidity 
Figures 3 and 4 depict the comparative 
prevalence 
of any diarrhoea 
and of severe diarrhoea 
per day over 
the 6-month 
period 
in the intervention 
and control 
sites. In February, 
both types of diarrhoea 
were more 
prevalent 
in the intervention 
site, but from March to 
June 
the prevalence 
in the intervention 
site was 
consistently 
lower than that of the control 
site. In the 
final month, 
the difference 
between 
the sites in di- 
arrhoeal 
rates disappeared. 
The overall patterns 
of 
diarrhoeal 
morbidity 
were similar in both sites, with 
peaks in April and May, which are the hottest months 
of the year. 
Growth status 
In February 
the percentage 
of children 
in the 
normal growth category with WAZ above - 2SD was 
53% in the intervention 
site and 58% in the control 
site. While the percentage 
of normal children 
did not 
differ significantly, 
Fig. 5 illustrates 
that the percent- 
ages of severely malnourished 
children (below - 3SD 
WAZ) were reduced over time in the intervention 
site 
compared 
to the control 
site. These rates were higher 
in the intervention 
group from November 
to March; 
in April, both sites had about the same rates. From 
May 
to July, 
these 
percentages 
were 
significantly 
lower in the intervention 
site. 
An analysis 
of same 
data 
shows 
that 
a sharp 
decrease 
from 40 to 5% in the rate of bottle feeding 
in the intervention 
site from 
the beginning 
to the 
middle of the study. This is consistent 
with the finding 
that height-for-age 
Z scores were lower in the inter- 
vention 
children 
compared 
to the control 
children, 
with differences 
that increased 
over time. In contrast, 
weight-for-height 
Z scores were higher for the inter- 
vention 
children 
compared 
with the control 
site chil- 
dren, 
with a similar 
trend 
of increasing 
differences 
between 
the two sites. 
Within -intervention site analysis 
The adoption 
rates of the intervention 
varied from 
85 to 98% for different 
themes. 
The mother’s 
edu- 
cation 
was correlated 
with her understanding 
score 
(r = 0.18; 
P = O.OOS), cleanliness 
score 
(r = 0.31; 
P = O.OOOl), child’s WAZ (r = 0.29; P = O.OOOl), and 
marginally 
with her overall adoption 
score (r = 0.10; 
P = 0.09). The child’s age correlated 
negatively 
with 
both food hygiene score (r = -0.20; 
P = 0.004) and 
overall 
adoption 
score 
(r = -0.12; 
P = 0.05). As 
shown in Table 3 the mother’s 
understanding 
score 
was significantly 
associated 
with all outcome 
vari- 
ables. Food hygiene and overall adoption 
scores were 
correlated 
negatively 
with diarrhoea 
and positively 
with cleanliness 
and the weight-for-age 
Z-score. 
The 
data also confirm expected associations 
among clean- 
liness, diarrhoea 
and WAZ scores. 
DISCUSSION 
A blind or double blind and randomized 
interven- 
tion trial was beyond the scope of this study. There- 
fore, we took other measures 
to minimize 
selection, 
interviewer, 
and respondent 
biases. Intervention 
re- 
search that mobilized 
the community 
to participate 
in 
problem 
solving, 
message/product 
design 
and im- 
plementation 
and intervention 
was too intensive 
to 
conduct 
simultaneously 
in a statistical 
sample 
of 
randomly 
selected 
communities. 
The best we were 
able to achieve was an N of two comparable 
commu- 
nities. As noted in the Methods 
section, 
we selected 
the less developed 
and more environmentally 
con- 
taminated 
community 
for intervention, 
to increase 
the probability 
that measurable 
differences 
after the 
program 
would 
be attributable 
to the intervention 
rather than to site differences. 
The intervention 
could 
not be blinded 
from 
its 
participants, 
although 
the purpose 
of the observa- 
tional hygiene study at the control site was concealed. 
Moreover, 
it was not possible 
to randomly 
assign 
study subjects at the same community 
to intervention 
vs non-intervention 
groups due to the highly contam- 
inative nature 
of our community 
mobilization 
cam- 
paign. 
In order to minimize 
interviewer/observer 
bias, we 
did not involve the personnel 
who were implementing 
the 
intervention 
in 
data 
collection. 
All 
project 
workers, 
including 
the data collectors, 
took an oath 
which had a strong 
religious value, to perform 
their 
duties exactly as instructed. 
The penalty for breaking 
this oath was job loss.

bias, hygiene and cleanliness

Diarrhoeal intervention in rural Bangladesh 
169 
conditions were assessed by observation 
rather than 
self report. No incentive was provided to the mothers 
for reporting or showing better hygiene practices or 
absence of diarrhoea, 
and no medicine 
or other 
treatment was given for reporting diarrhoea. 
To gather reasonably 
accurate information, 
we 
began training the two field workers who collected 
morbidity and hygiene information 
3 months before 
the intervention. 
As they practiced gathering weekly 
information 
over the 3 months, the data recording 
procedures were refined and standardized 
and the 
respondents 
become experienced 
in recalling 
and 
providing 
information. 
To help mothers to recall 
dates, for example, we used weekly local market days 
and Friday, 
the weekly prayer gathering 
day, as 
landmarks. We did not use this first 3 months of data. 
In the absence of an intervention 
there would have 
been little or no motivation 
to bias the data during 
this learning period. It was expected that the report- 
ing habits acquired during 
this time would have 
continued 
for the duration of the study. In view of 
these procedures 
and our close attention 
to data 
quality control, we believe it is unlikely that the data 
suffer from serious biases or inaccuracies. 
The intervention 
and control communities 
were 
similar in many crucial aspects including source of 
drinking water, latrine condition and location, child 
care and cultural practices, wealth as measured by 
household possessions, and demographics (age, sex, 
mother’s and father’s age). Both were located in 
low-lying area and exposed to similar sources of 
environmental 
contamination. 
Yet the intervention 
site was somewhat more rural 
and agricultural and the control site more exposed to 
modernizing 
influences. A quarter of the control vs 
half of the intervention 
households owned agricul- 
tural land while 22% of the controls vs 11% of the 
intervention 
fathers had salaried jobs. Although few 
mothers had attended school in either sample; the 
difference in proportions 
and in average years of 
schooling for both mothers and fathers were statisti- 
cally significant. As found in other studies [17,23,24], 
these pre-existing differences favoured the health of 
the children in the control site. The more agricultural 
intervention 
site families owned more animals and 
had more animal feces littering the children’s play 
areas. The presence of feces in the play area was 
associated with higher prevalence of diarrhoea. Ma- 
ternal education 
was associated with better cleanli- 
ness and growth status. These disparities, therefore 
worked against the intervention 
rather than giving 
unattributable 
impact to it. 
The results of this study suggest that community- 
based intervention 
can improve hygiene knowledge, 
modify relevant practices, lower diarrhoeal disease, 
and reduce malnutrition 
even in an impoverished 
setting with many undesirable 
cultural beliefs that 
interfere with child health. 
We will first focus on ways in which the interven- 
tion enabled its participants 
to gain some control 
over their environment, 
then on its interactions with 
environmental 
and climatic constraints. 
The occur- 
rence of diarrhoea 
was believed to be primarily 
supernatural 
and beyond human control before the 
intervention 
[ 151. The intervention 
provided 
some 
scientific understanding 
of disease by teaching germ 
theory and increasing 
mother’s awareness of the 
danger of feces contamination. 
The intervention 
also 
empowered the mothers to take control over some 
aspects of their health. 
The 
supportive 
group 
discussions, 
in 
which 
mothers 
shared 
their 
experiences, 
possibly 
con- 
tributed to their self-confidence and self-esteem. This 
process encouraged mothers to identify their prob- 
lems and to understand 
the benefits derived from the 
interventions. Their better understanding 
appeared to 
inspire them to adopt these interventions at high rates 
into their daily lives and practice hygienic behaviours 
1151. 
The project’s products and messages made it more 
convenient 
for families to practice cleanliness and 
sanitation behaviours. For example, it was observed 
that once provided with a dirt thrower, other family 
members became more willing to clean feces, while 
previously it had been only the mother’s task. This 
enthusiastic 
response was due to the fact that this 
product allowed users to keep their hands clean and 
to remove feces completely from the ground [25]. As 
expected, the higher adoption 
of the interventions 
was associated with a higher score in overall cleanli- 
ness behaviours. These in turn may have contributed 
to reduced diarrhoeal 
transmissions 
and improved 
WAZ. 
While the intervention 
appeared to be effective in 
mitigating 
the 
effects 
of 
seasonal 
temperature 
changes, it was not adequate to cope with flooding. 
The effect of extreme seasonal variations in tempera- 
ture and water level also were beyond the control of 
the intervention. 
In the hottest months, April-May, 
the high rates of diarrhoea were probably related to 
the use of contaminated 
water for cleaning, washing 
and food preparation. Although during these months 
rapid proliferation 
of microorganisms 
in foods and 
water was associated with the diarrhoea 
epidemic 
documented by Black in another study [26] in rural 
Bangladesh, the intervention 
site had substantially 
lower rates of diarrhoea than the rates at the control 
site. Consistent 
use of tubewell water for drinking, 
children’s food preparation, 
and washing hands be- 
fore meals in the intervention 
site may have con- 
tributed to this difference. 
Floods are a major threat to life in Bangladesh. 
During flooding the quality of water is poor. The 
intervention recommended depositing all feces in a pit 
at the edge of courtyard. 
July floods carried this 
collection 
of feces in bulk and contaminated 
the 
source of bathing, washing and cooking water of low 
lying homes. In this month, a substantially 
higher 
diarrhoeal rate was observed among the children of 
households with flooded feces pits, possibly because 

170 
NASAR U. AHMED et al. 
water 
hygiene 
during 
flooding 
is already 
bad and 
feces-pit 
overflow 
made it worse [25]. In contrast, 
in 
the control 
site, where feces were thrown 
into a field 
or near the homestead 
and allowed to dry in the sun, 
there was no immediate 
source 
of heavy contami- 
nation 
in the homestead. 
In the future, 
it could be 
recommended 
that feces in the pit be buried 
with 
sand, ash or soil in layers every few days and then 
completely 
sealed over with enough 
soil, followed 
by 
constructing 
a new pit for further 
use. 
During 
flooding, 
with contaminated 
water it may 
be suggested 
that tubewell water be used for washing 
and cooking 
purposes, 
although 
villagers resisted the 
use of tubewell 
water 
in cooking 
trials 
due to its 
strong iron flavor and tendency 
to discolor 
and spoil 
foods [ 151. Further 
trials over a longer time could test 
storing 
the tubewell 
water before use so as to lower 
its iron flavor by sedimentation. 
The traditional 
use 
of alum, now proven to be effective to reduce bacteria 
loads 
[27], could 
be reintroduced 
for water 
purifi- 
cation 
of river/pond 
water. 
The 
intervention 
positively 
affected 
children’s 
health 
in several 
ways. While child diarrhoeal 
rates 
dropped 
rapidly 
in the intervention 
site, there ap- 
peared 
to be no significant 
impact on weight-for-age 
in the first few months. 
Initial growth 
status 
of the 
intervention 
children 
was lower, which had a negative 
effect on their growth 
status in the following 
months 
compared 
to the control 
site children. 
However, 
the 
malnutrition 
(WAZ, 
WHZ) 
rate at the intervention 
site was eventually 
lower than that at the control 
site. 
Like other studies [4,28] which have shown diarrhoea 
to have an adverse 
effect on weight 
gain, our data 
suggest 
that the lower diarrhoeal 
prevalence 
in the 
intervention 
site decreased 
the malnutrition 
rates 
there. 
As hypothesized, 
the effects of the intervention 
on 
child 
weight 
gain were mediated 
through 
reduced 
diarrhoea 
and improved 
food 
hygiene 
behaviours. 
Food 
hygiene 
behaviours, 
including 
avoiding 
overnight 
storage 
of cooked 
food which is usually 
contaminated 
under high environmental 
temperature 
[29] and using tubewell water for children’s 
food, may 
have improved 
the absorption 
and utilization 
of food 
since a reduction 
in diarrhoea 
reduces catabolism 
and 
improves 
intestinal 
absorption 
[28]. Further 
growth 
improvement 
could 
be achieved 
by including 
im- 
proved 
diets in the hygiene 
interventions. 
In the intervention 
site, the mother’s 
understanding 
of germ theory 
and the workers’ 
strong 
discourage- 
ment of bottle 
feeding 
possibly 
resulted 
in a sharp 
decline 
in the rate of bottle 
feeding. 
Although 
the 
reduction 
in bottle 
feeding 
presumably 
decreased 
diarrhoea, 
milk 
consumption 
among 
the children 
may have been reduced. 
This could account 
for the 
increasing 
difference 
in HAZ between 
the interven- 
tion and control 
site over time. An analysis 
of the 
control 
site data [30] showed 
that bottle feeding was 
strongly 
positively 
related to HAZ but had no associ- 
ation 
with 
WAZ. 
Improvement 
in WHZ 
in the 
intervention 
site may have been caused by increased 
weight with relatively 
delayed 
linear growth. 
In 
designing 
food 
hygiene 
interventions, 
one 
should 
be careful about negative 
effects of any kind 
of food 
withdrawal 
or reduction 
in impoverished 
settings 
where a small incremental 
amount 
of food 
may make 
a relatively 
large contribution 
to child 
growth. 
CONCLUSION 
We believe the key factors that contributed 
to the 
effectiveness 
of the intervention 
were as follows: 
(I) Obtaining 
a relatively 
comprehensive 
under- 
standing 
of local norms 
and cultural 
beliefs during 
the early stages of intervention 
planning. 
(2) Developing 
the interventions 
by a relatively 
long-term 
working group made up primarily 
of mem- 
bers of the target group and their opinion 
leaders in 
every phase of the process. 
(3) Developing 
hygiene 
practices 
from within 
the 
community 
through 
iterative trials led by the working 
group 
in order 
to ensure 
their acceptance 
and high 
adoption 
rates. 
(4) Developing 
simple, direct and specific messages 
resembling 
locally popular 
proverbs, 
poems and folk 
songs to make the messages 
memorable, 
motivating 
and effective. 
(5) Teaching 
the germ theory 
through 
interactive 
small group discussions 
led by working 
group mem- 
bers in a manner 
that empowered 
mothers 
to identify 
their problems 
and to find their own solutions, 
and 
inspired 
them to action in a group of similar people. 
It is often recommended 
that educational 
interven- 
tions should focus on small number of behaviours, 
to 
do so, however, 
may run counter 
to the process 
of 
community 
empowerment. 
This project attempted 
to 
provide 
the community 
with decision 
making 
skills. 
On the basis of their understanding 
of disease trans- 
mission, 
project 
participants 
identified 
their 
many 
hygiene 
problems, 
the conditions 
and practices 
re- 
sponsible 
for these problems. 
They naturally 
sought 
a sense of closure in breaking 
the chain of diarrhoeal 
transmission. 
Our forcing 
them to focus on a small 
number 
of behaviours 
would 
have detracted 
from 
their completion 
of this task.
