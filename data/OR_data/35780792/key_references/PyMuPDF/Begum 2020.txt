Abstract
Diarrhea is a leading cause of death among under five children in developing countries. The burden of child diarrhea in
Bangladesh is still significant. Safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) can limit the events. This study aimed to assess
the effectiveness of WASH education of mothers or caregivers on child diarrhea. A community-based randomized control trial
was conducted in the selected households of a rural community in Dumki Upazila, Patuakhali from March–June 2019. A total of
202 mothers/caregivers received intervention and 202 did not receive intervention. A pre-structured questionnaire was used to
gather information on household WASH activities and diarrheal cases. Baseline data were collected first from the intervention
group before providing education. WASH messages were given to the intervention group by face-to-face discussion. Both groups
were followed up for diarrheal episodes for 3 months. Diarrheal prevalence of intervening group is compared with that of baseline
and control. The results revealed that diarrheal prevalence was 11.4% (95% CI: 7.4–16.59%), 4.0% (95% CI: 1.7–7.65%), and
14.9% (95% CI: 10.25–20.52%) in baseline, intervention, and control group, respectively. Also, diarrhea was found lower in the
intervention group than baseline (Z = −2.524; P value = 0.012) and control (Z = −1.85; P value = 0.04). WASH interventions
were found effective to reduce the diarrheal episodes among under five children in rural community. Further investigation is
necessary to assess the long-term effect of such intervention in other similar settings.

Introduction
Diarrhea is the second deadliest illness among under five chil-
dren worldwide [1, 2]. More than half of all diarrheal cases
occur in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia [3]. In
Bangladesh, 20,155 under five children died due to diarrheal
disease in 2008 [4]. National prevalence of diarrhea among
this age group in Bangladesh is 6.1% [5]. Diarrhea hampers
physical and mental development of child through malnutri-
tion and needs to be prevented [6].
Unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation, and hygiene prac-
tices are responsible for 85% of diarrheal mortality [7].
Approximately, 2.4 million yearly global deaths could be
prevented through practicing proper hygiene and reliable
drinking water [8]. Good domestic hygiene practice also
proofs to be effective against diarrhea [9]. Hence, its preven-
tive measure needs to be evaluated rather than its treatment. In
addition, a recent review showed WASH interventions are
affordable and effective in minimizing diarrhea burden [10],

so a number of good research on water, sanitation, and hy-
giene intervention have been successfully done in Pakistan
[11], Ethiopia [12], and India [13].
In Bangladesh, previous study in a plain district revealed
hygiene intervention increased mother’s hygiene knowledge
and practices but failed to make significant reduction of diar-
rheal morbidity due to seasonal factors [14]. The impact of
WASH educational intervention on childhood diarrhea in the
rural coastal setting in Bangladesh remains unexplored, al-
though childhood diarrheal prevalence was 10.9% in southern
coastal area of Bangladesh which is almost double to the na-
tional burden [15]. Flood, cyclone, river erosion, tidal surge
etc. are increasing the water, sanitation, and health problem
like child diarrhea in this site than other part of the country
[16]. Immediate action needs to be taken to halt the diarrheal
occurrence in this setting. Thus, intervention with WASH ed-
ucation may improve the practices and reduce the child diar-
rhea. The findings of this investigation could be helpful for the
authorities to take the necessary program to prevent child di-
arrhea in larger coastal belt of Bangladesh. Therefore, the
study aimed to assess the effectiveness of WASH educational
intervention on childhood diarrhea.
Methodology
Study Setting
The study was conducted in different communities of Dumki
sub-district of Patuakhali (district), Bangladesh. Dumki is sit-
uated beside a river, 56 km straight line away from the Bay of
Bengal and divided into five unions (smallest administrative
unit). Two unions (Muradia and Pangashia) were selected for
this study. Total population of Dumki was 70,665 as per 2011
census. This area is a poor where 65% households depends on
the agricultural activities [17].
Study Design
We conducted a randomized control trial among
mothers or caregivers in some selected communities
from March to June 2019. Investigators assessed the
eligibility of households in the study area and identified
404 households. Having at least one under five children
and planned to continue to reside in the area during
intervention period was eligible for the study. To allo-
cate intervention, the participants were divided them in-
to two groups using simple random sampling technique.
One of the investigators who were not involved in en-
rollment process programmed a spreadsheet to generate
randomly the integers 1 or 2 with the equal probability
of generating a 2 vs. a 1. The random numbers were
applied sequentially to the list of all participants. The
respondents with 1 were assigned to control and those
with a 2 were assigned to WASH education. We calcu-
lated the sample size using single population proportion
test considering 3% margin of error, 95% CI, and 5%
overall diarrheal prevalence in the Barishal division [5].
Both mothers and caregivers with their child were
followed up for 3 months to monitor diarrhea occur-
rence. Baseline data on history of child diarrhea in the
previous 3 months were also collected for intervention
group. Diarrhea was defined as the passage of three or
more times loose or watery stools in a 24-h period [18].
Data Collection Procedure
A pre-structured questionnaire used to determine diarrheal
occurrence at the last 3 months and other associated factors.
Trained investigators carried out face-to-face interview to col-
lect baseline information from intervention groups. At the
same time, educational intervention on WASH messages
was given to the participant. Interviewers delivered proper
information on personal hygiene, food hygiene, kitchen, and
household sanitation to every respondent. Late morning and
afternoon were chosen for collecting data and providing edu-
cation messages. After 3 months of intervention, the other
investigators visited again to intervention and control group
and recorded data by using same questionnaire. During this
period, child mortality rate was zero and investigators re-
visited the households in the case of missing participants.
Statistical Analysis
We performed descriptive analysis to summarize the de-
mographic characteristics and prevalence of diarrhea. A
normal population test was used to compare between
the groups. Statistical package for social sciences
(SPSS) 20 was used for analysis and 5% level of sig-
nificance was considered.
Results
Socio-Demographic Characteristics of Respondents
There was a similarity in socio-demographic status within the
cases and intervention sites. The gender of the child, mother,
and father occupation and family size were nearly close be-
tween cases and control groups. The illiteracy rate of mother
and father was almost double in cases (10.9% for mother and
18.0% father) than control (4.9% for mother and 9.4% for
father) households. Less than 50 % family both for cases
(47.3%) and control (26.6%) sites earned ≤10,000 BD TK
monthly (Table 1).

Pattern of WASH Activities Among the Respondents
and Households
Use of unhygienic kacha (mud) toilet reduced to 60% after
intervention than cases (66%) and control (85%) groups.
Closed waste disposal bin increased (14.4%) from 1% in base-
line and zero in control. In the case of cooking water, 18.3%
caregivers used tube well water which was only 5% in other
groups. Use of dustbin for leftovers increased 26.7% from
12.4% in baseline. Observation of insect attack by caregivers
reported 82.7% in intervention which was 95.5% and 84.7%
in baseline and control, respectively (Table 2).

study explored the effect of WASH education on the diarrheal
incidence among under five children in this coastal area. The
study shows that WASH educational intervention significant-
ly reduced the incidence of childhood diarrhea.
We found WASH educational significantly reduced diar-
rheal prevalence in intervention group than baseline and con-
trol groups which support studies done in Pakistan [11] and
India [13]. However, intervention approach might be failed
due to social and cultural inadaptability or misunderstanding
of target community problem [20, 21]. Previous studies in
Myanmar [22] and Manikgonj district of Bangladesh [14]
showed interventions failed to measure health outcome. Due
to remote setting, they have poor knowledge about hygiene
and sanitation. After intervention, cooking water used from
tube well and waste disposal practices improved in the inter-
vening households. Selecting suitable individual intervention
approach may reduce diarrheal episodes in this area.
Various WASH interventions reveal diarrhea risk reduc-
tions between 27 and 53% in children aged under 5 years
[23]. We found higher 73% and 64.9% reductions of diarrheal
episodes at intervention group compared with control and
baseline respectively. A study reported WASH educational
intervention, consisting discussion and demonstration, re-
duced diarrheal risk of 35% in Jigjiga district, eastern
Ethiopia [12]. This higher reduction may be due to lack of
previous awareness regarding hygienic practices among the
participants.
We found 8% more participants in intervention group who
washed hand with soap after cleaning child’s feces. A study
done among different districts in Bangladesh estimated hand
washing with soap after cleaning a child’s feces increased
from 22 to 36% [24]. Our study revealed households’ waste
management practices improved at intervene group. Use of
closed waste disposal system and dustbin for cooking left-
overs increased at intervention groups. This improper waste
management of the households might lead to diarrhea in con-
trol groups [25]. WASH education may make quantitative and
qualitative changes in multiple preventive practices which
might dramatically reduce the clinical episodes.
In our study, cases were determined by mother or care-
givers’ report according to the definition of diseases, without
biological or even practitioner’s confirmation. All information
was collected through interview. Hence, there is a possibility
of information bias. Recall bias may also influence the preci-
sion of our estimates. However, trained investigators carefully
interviewed the respondents which may reduce the bias in
minimum level. The baseline and follow-up information were
collected at different times of the year. We were unable to
follow up study participants for longer periods because of
limited resources. However, use of control adjusted the sea-
sonal difference in disease burden. Despite of these limita-
tions, we do believe, this educational message promotes
awareness and improves hygienic practices to reduce diarrhea.
Conclusion
This study explored the effectiveness of WASH educational
intervention of mothers/caregivers on child diarrhea. Diarrhea
has been considering the significant cause of morbidity and
mortality among under five children. Respective authorities
have been trying to cope up the vulnerable situation through
different interventions. WASH education was found protec-
tive to reduce child diarrhea in this areas. Hence, quicker
education program about WASH among mothers or care-
givers may be used to minimize the episodes of diarrhea in
other similar low resource settings.
