To evaluate the effectiveness of an intensive hand hygiene campaign on reducing absenteeism caused 
by to influenza-like illness (ILI), diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and laboratory-confirmed influenza, we conducted 
a randomized control trial in 60 elementary schools in Cairo, Egypt. Children in the intervention schools 
were required to wash hands twice daily, and health messages were provided through entertainment 
activities; Data were collected on student absenteeism and reasons for illness. School nurses collected 
nasal swabs from students with ILI, which were tested by using a qualitative diagnostic test for influenza 
A and B. Compared with results for the control group, in the intervention group, overall absences caused 
by ILI decreased (reduced 40%, p<0.0001), diarrhea (reduced 30%, p<0.0001), conjunctivitis (reduced 
67%, p<0.0001), and laboratory-confirmed influenza (reduced 50%, p<0.0001). An intensive hand 
hygiene campaign was effective in reducing absenteeism caused by these illnesses. 
Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and diarrheal diseases cause substantial illness and 
death worldwide. Most of the estimated 5.5 million deaths associated with ARI and diarrhea 
occur in children from resource-limited countries. In these settings, where access to health 
services is often lacking, effective prevention methods are paramount. ARIs cause >4 million 
Page 1 of 16 

  
deaths annually and account for >7% of global deaths (1). Many ARIs are caused by viruses, 
including influenza A and B. Influenza viruses circulate in Egypt all year, peaking in winter 
months (2). Although influenza is generally self-limiting, each year it causes 3–5 million cases of 
severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths worldwide (3). The greatest number of excess deaths 
occur in persons >65 years of age, yet influenza greatly affects schoolage children as well. In 
addition, schoolchildren play a key role in transmission of influenza during community 
epidemics (4). Slowing or preventing transmission of influenza viruses among children may 
diminish the explosive transmission pattern that often characterizes annual influenza epidemics 
(5). 
Diarrheal disease is the second leading cause of childhood illness and death and is 
responsible for ≈2 million deaths annually in children <5 years of age (6,7). Frequent and 
prolonged episodes of nonfatal diarrhea can lead to malnutrition, stunting of growth, and 
absenteeism in schoolage children (8,9). In Egypt, where child mortality rates have been reduced 
in recent years, diarrheal diseases still account for 13.9% of deaths in children <5 years of age. 
Much of the reduction in deaths caused by diarrheal diseases has resulted from better case 
management, including use of oral rehydration therapy and improved water and sanitation. 
Although deaths have decreased, the incidence of diarrheal diseases has remained relatively 
unchanged (10). 
Hand hygiene is a key intervention for reducing transmission of ARI and diarrhea in 
community settings. Hand hygiene, using antibacterial soap or alcohol-based sanitizers, has been 
reported to result in notable reductions in the incidence of diarrheal diseases (11). Hand hygiene 
has also been specifically recommended for prevention of diseases with pandemic potential, such 
as severe acute respiratory syndrome and for influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (12–14). The 
objectives of this study were to measure the effectiveness of an intensive hand hygiene 
intervention campaign in reducing the incidence of absenteeism caused by illness and the 
incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza in schoolchildren in Egypt.

Methods 
Design 
We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of an intensive 
hand hygiene campaign in reducing the absenteeism of schoolchildren due to illness, student in-
class reported illness, and laboratory-confirmed influenza. The primary outcome measure was a 
determination of the rates of absenteeism caused by influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-
confirmed influenza, in which absenteeism caused by diarrhea and conjunctivitis were 
considered secondary outcomes. The study was performed over a 12-week period, February 16–
May 12, 2008. 
School Settings 
Cairo Governorate was chosen because of the continuous availability of water in school 
settings. The socioeconomic characteristics of families sending children to government schools 
in Cairo are homogenous in terms of education, income, and home sanitation facilities (15). Most 
schools in Cairo have 1 large restroom with ≈10 sinks and an additional 8–10 sinks on the 
playground. No sinks are available in the classrooms. Average size of each classroom is ≈48 m2 
with 69 students (≈0.7 m2/student). Before the campaign, neither soap nor hand-drying material 
was available in the schools. Hand washing, if done at all, was only performed by rinsing hands 
in water. Hands were typically dried on clothing or air-dried. 
Sample Size 
The sample size was calculated with the intent to detect a 20% reduction in laboratory-
confirmed influenza in the intervention group, using a rate of 1.5% of laboratory-confirmed 
influenza per week in the control group and 70% participation. After doubling the sample to 
adjust for clustering, a total of 27 schools per group were adequate to detect this difference in 
laboratory-confirmed influenza with 80% power and 95% confidence. (The formula used to 
estimate the sample size is available at www.openepi.com/Menu/OpenEpiMenu.htm.) Sixty 
elementary schools (30 intervention and 30 control schools) were randomly selected from a 
numbered list of all 725 government elementary schools in Cairo by using a computer-generated 
random number table. All children at the intervention schools, regardless of grade, were included 
in the hand hygiene campaign activities, but absenteeism and illness data were only collected 
from children in the first 3 primary grades.

School Teams 
At each intervention school, a hand hygiene team composed of 3 teachers (social studies, 
arts, sports) and the school nurse was established. The hand hygiene team ensured that all 
predesigned activities for the hand hygiene campaign were implemented on a weekly basis 
(Table 1). The school nurses and teachers were trained to interview students, collect absenteeism 
data, interview parents, and complete data collection forms, and the nurses were trained to 
collect and process nasal swabs to test for influenza. At control schools, the nurses were 
supported by a single surveillance officer who was assigned to complete data collection forms. 
Although the methods for providing soap varied among the intervention schools, parents 
usually sent children to school with a small bag containing bar soap and a clean towel. If families 
could not afford soap and hand-drying material, the school administration provided them. 
Six independent social workers visited the schools weekly; each visited 10 schools per 
week (5 intervention and 5 control schools). During each visit, they observed hand hygiene 
activities, soap and drying material availability, and the process of students washing their hands 
during the school day; they also verified the accuracy of the illness data collected by teachers. 
Intervention Communication Campaign 
An intensive campaign to promote hand hygiene was launched in the intervention schools 
to raise the awareness of students, teachers, nurses, and parents regarding the importance of hand 
hygiene and to increase the proportion of students washing their hands. Hand hygiene teams 
required students in the first 3 primary grades to wash their hands at least twice during the school 
day for ≈45 seconds, followed by proper rinsing and drying with a clean cloth towel. 
Campaign materials were developed for 3 groups (students, teachers, parents). The 
teachers’ guidebook included a detailed description of the students’ activities and methods to 
encourage students to practice these activities. Posters were placed near sinks in the classrooms 
and on the playground. The primary message was to wash hands with soap and water upon 
arriving at school, before and after meals, after using the bathroom, and after coughing or 
sneezing. 
Grade-specific student booklets were developed; each included a set of 12 games and fun 
activities that promoted hand washing. At least 1 activity was used each week. A special song to 
promote hand hygiene was developed and played regularly at schools. Informational fliers were 
Page 4 of 16 

  
distributed to parents to reinforce the messages delivered at the schools. Many schools were 
creative in motivating students to comply with washing hands, such as selecting a weekly hand 
hygiene champion, developing theater plays, and launching school contests for drawings and 
songs. 
Data Collection and Illness Definitions 
Data were collected for 12 weeks during February–May 2008. The regulations of the 
Ministry of Education require schools in Egypt to record absences each day in a school log book, 
classified as either absence caused by to an illness or a non-illness. The hand hygiene teams 
visited each classroom to verify the information collected by the school administration. They 
also telephoned parents of children absent due to illness on the first day of absence and 
interviewed them to complete an absenteeism data collection form that included specific 
symptoms of illness. Symptoms and signs of illness and detailed case definitions were the same 
as those used by Bowen et al. (16). 
A student episode of absence caused by illness was defined as a student who was absent 
for any number of consecutive or nonconsecutive days during 1 calendar week with symptoms 
affecting the same organ system. The incidence of absence due to illness was defined as the 
number of absences caused by illness per 100 student-weeks. Rates of absence caused by illness 
with specific symptoms or signs were calculated as the number of absences due to illness 
associated with specific symptoms per 100 student-weeks. The incidence of in-class illness was 
defined as the number of reported in-class episodes of illness among the first 3 primary grade 
students per 100 student weeks. 
Children who were absent from school because of ILI (defined as fever >38°C and either 
cough or sore throat) were approached by the school nurse, who either visited the child at home 
(if possible) or asked the child to visit the school clinic if they returned to school within 3 days of 
absence. In addition, students who became ill during the school day were referred by teachers to 
the school clinic nurse. The school nurse interviewed the students and completed the in-class 
illness data collection form that included the same symptoms and signs used on the absenteeism 
data collection tool.

Laboratory Methods 
Nurses collected a nasal swab from children who visited the school clinic with ILI. Nasal 
swabs were collected by inserting and rotating a sterile swab into the anterior nares; the 
specimen was then tested for influenza A and B viruses by using Quick Vue, a rapid, point-of-
care antigen detection test designed for use by nonlaboratory personnel (QuickVue; Quidel 
Corp., San Diego, CA, USA). This test was conducted only for students who had prior written 
approval of a parent. 
Ethics and Informed Consent 
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the US Naval Medical Research Unit 
No. 3 (NAMRU3) Institutional Review Board (Protocol #NAMRU3.NAMRU3.2007–0007). A 
written letter describing the purpose of the study signed by the school principal of each school 
was distributed to the parents or guardians of all students in the first 3 primary grades. In 
addition, consent for obtaining a nasal swab from students reporting ILI was sought. Control 
schools received the same intervention program at the end of the study. 
Statistical Methods 
To adjust for the cluster design effect, we calculated the rates of absenteeism and illness 
separately for each school. This was performed by dividing the number of episodes of 
absenteeism or illness by the number of student weeks. The answer was then multiplied by 100 
to obtain rates per 100 student-weeks. Since the rates were not normally distributed, the medians 
of the mean rates for the intervention and control schools were compared by using the Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test; p values <0.05 were considered significant. 
Results 
During the 12-week observation period, 20,882 students (282,832 student-weeks of 
observation) were enrolled at the intervention schools in the first through third grades; 23,569 
students (250,584 student-weeks) were enrolled at the 30 control schools. All parents approved 
providing information about their children’s illnesses; however, 7,112 parents (16%) did not give 
permission for the collection of nasal swab specimens from their children, and the distribution 
was similar in both groups (p>0.05). No significant differences were found for the 2 groups in 
Page 6 of 16 

  
median age (8 years), sex distribution (51% male), or the median number of students per school 
(635 [interquartile range 394–978]). 
One-week baseline data were collected for intervention and control schools 2 weeks 
before the hand hygiene intervention activities. This step was carried out to test data collection 
procedures and ensure the collection of good quality data. No significant difference was found 
between the intervention group and control group in the rate of absenteeism caused by ILI 
(relative risk 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9–1.4) or in the rate of confirmed influenza 
episodes (relative risk 0.8, 95% CI 0.5–1.5). 
During the 12-week observation period, 4,259 students received a diagnosis of ILI in the 
control and intervention schools (Figure 1). The rate for influenza testing of in-class students 
who reported ILI was similar in the control and intervention schools (74% and 77%, 
respectively; p>0.05). The proportion of students tested who were absent because of ILI was 
only 12% in the control schools, compared with 22% in the intervention group (p<0.01). The rate 
of laboratory-confirmed influenza was higher among in-class students who reported their illness 
in the control schools (35%) than the rate in the intervention schools (18%) (p<0.01). Students 
who were absent because ILI in the control schools showed a higher rate of laboratory-confirmed 
influenza (27%) than those in the intervention school (7%) (p<0.01). 
Incidence of absence (per 100 students) caused by ILI was lower in the intervention 
group than in the control group for weeks 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12. During the first 4-week period, the 
2 groups showed no differences in absence incidence caused by diarrhea and conjunctivitis, 
although the incidence of absence caused by these conditions was significantly lower in the 
intervention group for weeks 5–8 and weeks 9–12 (Figure 2). 
During the 12-week observation period, 4,259 students were diagnosed with ILI in the 
control and intervention schools (n = 2,552 and n = 1,707, respectively). In the control schools, 
881 cases (34.5%) of ILI were identified through in-class reported illness and 74.2% of these 
students (n = 654) were tested for influenza, of which 34.9% (n = 228) were positive. In contrast, 
790 cases (46.3%) of ILI in the intervention schools were identified through in-class reporting, 
and while a similar proportion were (or was) tested for influenza virus (77%) (n = 609), only 
18.4% (n = 112) were positive for influenza virus (p<0.01). In control schools, 65.5% (n = 
1,671) of students were absent caused by ILI, of which 11.6% (n = 194) were tested and 27.3% 
Page 7 of 16 

  
(n = 141) were positive for influenza virus. In the intervention schools, ILI was responsible for 
53.7% (n = 917) of absenteeism. Of these 917 students, 199 (21.7%) were tested and only 6.5% 
(n = 13) were positive for influenza virus (p<0.01). The incidence of laboratory-confirmed 
influenza (A and B) per 1,000 students was significantly lower in the intervention group than in 
the control group over the 12 week observation period as well as during weeks 1–4 (p<0.01) 5–8 
(p<0.001), and 9–12 (p<0.001) (Figure 3). The incidence of influenza A in the intervention 
group was significantly lower during weeks 1–4 and 5–8, with no statistical difference in weeks 
9–12. The incidence of influenza B was significantly lower in the intervention group during 
weeks 5–8 and 9–12. 
The largest number of confirmed cases reported from any single school was from a 
control school where 66 cases were reported (7.24 cases/1,000 student-weeks). Overall, control 
schools were 1.6× (95% CI 1.1–2.2) more likely to report at least 1 confirmed case of influenza 
and 2.8× (95% CI 1.7–4.7) more likely to report multiple confirmed cases of influenza than 
intervention schools. 
The monitoring teams observed during their regular visits that ≈93% of the students in 
the intervention schools had soap and drying material available. All intervention schools (except 
2) had a rigorous system of ensuring that schoolchildren were washing their hands at least twice 
daily.  
Discussion 
Elementary schoolchildren are important vectors for spreading infectious diseases 
between themselves, their families, and their communities, especially in developing countries 
where public schools are extremely overcrowded. Aiello et al. noted that infectious agents that 
children contract in schools can result in infections in up to 50% of household members (17). 
Influenza transmission dynamics and potential methods for control are of particular 
interest in Egypt where avian influenza (H5N1) is endemic in poultry facilities, both commercial 
and backyard (18). Concern persists regarding the potential for recombination between seasonal 
influenza and subtype H5N1 strains with resultant rapid transmission of the recombinant strain, 
especially among high-density populations such as public school students and staff. In addition, 
Page 8 of 16 

  
nonpharmaceutical interventions, especially hand hygiene to mitigate pandemic (H1N1) 2009 
disease spread, have been advocated by international organizations (19). 
This randomized controlled intervention trial replicates well-known findings that 
intensive hand hygiene campaigns are highly successful in reducing absenteeism caused by 
illness and absenteeism caused by to ILI and diarrheal diseases among schoolchildren (16,20–
22). This study also duplicates recent findings that incidence of in-class reported illness is not 
significantly decreased by promotion of hand hygiene (16). However, this study also 
demonstrates a decrease in laboratory-confirmed influenza as a result of an intensive hand 
hygiene campaign. 
The 21% reduction in absenteeism caused by illness in intervention schools in this study 
is lower than the 42% observed among schoolchildren in the People’s Republic of China (16) 
and in similar US studies (20,21). These differences might be caused by the nature of the 
interventions implemented: ensuring a continuous free supply of soap as in China (16), 
promoting the use of alcohol-free instant hand sanitizers (20), or equipping classrooms with 
dispensers containing alcohol as described by Guinan et al. (21). 
In this 12-week hand hygiene trial, absenteeism caused by ILI decreased 40% and 
laboratory confirmed influenza decreased 47% in intervention schools relative to control schools. 
These reductions are higher than the 21% and 16% reductions in respiratory illness reported in 2 
meta-analyses of hand hygiene interventions in community settings (22,23) and the elementary 
school based hand hygiene program in China (16). A recent study evaluating the effectiveness of 
hand hygiene and facemasks in preventing influenza transmission in households in Hong Kong 
showed reduction in influenza transmission, but the differences were not significant (24). 
Differences in study design (household-based versus school-based) or in intensity of the 
intervention may have contributed to the positive effects in our study. Also, the greater relative 
reductions of influenza in our study might be attributed to specific influenza transmission 
dynamics for Egypt or the season when the study was conducted. In addition, Egypt’s unique 
hand hygiene campaign required students to wash hands at least twice during the school day, 
which might have had a direct influence on reducing influenza. 
The incidence of absenteeism caused by diarrhea was 33% lower in schoolchildren in the 
intervention schools. This result is similar to a Cochrane Reviews report that hand washing 
Page 9 of 16 

  
reduced the incidence of diarrheal episodes in children and adults by 30% (11). However, our 
study found a greater reduction in diarrhea than did a controlled trial conducted at a single 
elementary school (8), where the intervention only focused on providing alcohol-based hand 
sanitizers and wipes to disinfect classroom surfaces. Higher reduction rates of absenteeism 
caused by diarrhea (47%) were described in community settings that used soap for hand washing 
(25). 
Notably, the incidence of ILIs decreased more than did diarrheal disease (40% vs 33%) in 
this study. Previous studies have shown a greater reduction in diarrheal disease incidence, 
possibly because it is easier to adopt hand washing behaviors associated with diarrhea such as 
preparing/eating food, defecating, etc., relative to those associated with ILI such as washing 
hands after sneezing or coughing. Also of interest in this study was the marked (67%) decrease 
in absenteeism caused by conjunctivitis in intervention schools compared to results for control 
schools. 
There are several important limitations in this study. First, because study teams and 
schoolchildren and their parents were not blinded to the intervention, underreporting of illness as 
a cause for absenteeism in the intervention schools may have contributed to information bias. 
However, a rigorous system for identifying the reasons for illness based on a standardized list of 
symptoms as well as regular monitoring visits did not uncover any systematic errors. Differential 
interest of study teams may have contributed to the low rate of testing in students who were 
absent because of ILI in the control schools compared to the intervention schools (12% vs 22%); 
however, because nasal swabs were collected only from students who returned to school within 3 
days of illness onset, it is unlikely that samples tested reflected the most severe manifestation of 
illness. Absence incidence, defined as >1 day of absence in given week, may have been 
overestimated if a child were ill at the end of 1 week and at the beginning of the subsequent 
week; however, such overestimation is unlikely to have occurred differentially between the 
intervention and control schools.  
The relatively short duration of observation (12 weeks) may have also led to an 
overestimation of effect, as participants may have been more likely to adhere to new hand 
hygiene behavior over a shorter period. This study was not designed to measure sustainability of 
effect. In addition, the use of rapid tests for diagnosis of laboratory confirmed influenza with 
Page 10 of 16 

  
known low sensitivity (60% in some studies) likely resulted in an underestimation of illness in 
each group; this would likely bias the effects towards the null. Finally, because of delays in 
scientific and official approvals, the campaign was not started until the end of the influenza 
season; a higher baseline prevalence of respiratory and diarrheal diseases during the trial period 
may have led to a stronger program effect on disease-specific absenteeism. 
This intensive hand hygiene intervention was effective in reducing transmission of 
influenza among schoolchildren and was feasible and acceptable. In spite of operational 
difficulties in schools, the Egyptian Ministry of Health recommended hand hygiene as a means 
of reducing transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and other infectious diseases on a 
countrywide basis by using mass media campaigns (television and radio programs) and focusing 
on schoolchildren. Sustaining intensive national hand hygiene programs is challenging because 
of the high costs of training, printing materials, and logistics involved. In addition, the lack of 
continuous availability of soap and water is a limiting factor in remote areas. Identifying 
strategies that provide national, long-term, cost-effective alternatives to promote hand hygiene is 
critical in preventing transmission of diarrheal diseases and emerging respiratory viruses of 
pandemic potential.
