Objective: We conducted a longitudinal study to assess the impact of a hand-washing intervention on growth and
biomarkers of child health in Nepali slums. This is the ﬁrst study to evaluate the impact of hand-washing on markers of
subclinical, asymptomatic infections associated with childhood growth faltering.
Methods: We recruited a total sample of infants in the target age-range (3–12 months) living in the eight largest
Kathmandu slums, allocating them to intervention (n 5 45) and control (n 5 43) groups. In intervention areas, a small-
scale community-based hand-washing program was implemented for six months; in control areas, mothers continued
their normal practices. Time series linear regression was used to assess the impact of the intervention on levels of
morbidity, mucosal damage, immune stimulation and growth.
Results: As expected, children with higher levels of mucosal damage exhibited worse growth over the period of the
intervention (P 5 0.01, <0.001 and 0.03 for height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height z-scores, respectively).
We observed a 41% reduction in diarrheal morbidity (P 5 0.023) for the intervention group relative to control. However,
the hand-washing intervention did not lower levels of mucosal damage or immune stimulation, nor slow growth faltering.
Conclusions: Reducing exposure to pathogens is an important global health priority. This study conﬁrms the impor-
tance of hand-washing campaigns for reducing childhood morbidity. Yet our data suggest that promoting hand-washing
is necessary but not sufﬁcient to address chronic, subclinical infections. From a human biology standpoint, tackling the
root causes of childhood infections is needed to address growth faltering in the context of highly contaminated slum
environments. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 23:621–629, 2011.

The relationship between growth and health in childhood
is very simple: healthy children grow well; sick children do
not. Because of its remarkable sensitivity to environmental
insults, growth is recognized as the best global indicator of
child well-being (de Onis et al., 2000). Since the 1980s,
signiﬁcant progress has been made across the globe in
reducing rates of growth faltering: the prevalence of stunt-
ing in developing countries, for example, has fallen from
47% in 1980% to 33% in 2000 (ibid). However, despite this
progress, it is estimated that about a third of children
remain stunted, one in four is underweight, and one in
10 is wasted (UNICEF, 2009). The negative consequences
of growth faltering for health in the short-, medium- and
long-term are well documented (Calder and Jackson, 2000;
Norgan, 2000); ﬁnding ways to alleviate this problem is
therefore a pressing public health priority.
The two major causes of poor growth in childhood are
malnutrition and infection, which interact synergistically
to create a vicious cycle of growth faltering. Much atten-
tion has focused on the importance of diarrheal disease
in causing growth faltering. Diarrhea, of course, is not a
disease per se, but rather a symptom of an underlying
pathology, often indicating damage and inﬂammation of
the
mucosal
lining
of
the
gastrointestinal
tract.
Pathogenic damage to the lining of the intestine can lead
to maldigestion and malabsorption of food, resulting in
less energy being absorbed into the body. Such damage
also results in the stimulation of inﬂammatory and
immune responses to repair damaged tissue and ﬁght off
infection, thus leaving less energy available for processes
such as growth (Campbell et al., 2003; Lunn, 2000).
However, it is important to recognize that such intesti-
nal damage occurs along a spectrum and not all will result
in diarrheal symptoms: much of this damage occurs at a
subclinical level. In other words, it occurs at a level not
severe enough to produce clinically visible symptoms such
as diarrhea, but nonetheless results in some amount of
functional impairment to the digestive and absorptive
capacity of the intestinal mucosa (Lunn, 2000). In much of
the developing world, poor environmental conditions
result in children being frequently exposed to pathogenic
organisms and thus the prevalence of sub clinical infec-
tions is likely to be high (Adelekan et al., 2003). While, by
deﬁnition, such infections are less severe than those
resulting in diarrhea, the potentially chronic nature of
subclinical infections suggests they may be an important
factor in childhood growth faltering.
Indeed, some studies have indicated that subclinical
infections may be more important than diarrhea per se. A
study conducted in a peri-urban shanty town in Lima,
Peru by Checkley et al. (1997) investigated the importance
of both symptomatic and asymptomatic (i.e., subclinical)

cryptosporidiosis on child growth. Although asymptomatic
infections retarded weight gain to a lesser extent than
those resulting in diarrheal symptoms, the former were
almost twice as common. Thus the authors concluded that
it was the asymptomatic infections that had the most det-
rimental impact on child growth, due to their much
greater prevalence within the population. Similarly, Lunn
(2000) reported no association between diarrhea and
growth faltering in young Gambian children, but levels of
mucosal damage and its associated stimulation of the
immune system accounted for almost half of the observed
deﬁcits in height and weight. Finding ways to prevent
subclinical infections that result in mucosal damage and
immune stimulation may therefore be an important
means of preventing growth faltering in early childhood.
An obvious means of preventing such infections is to
limit children’s exposure to the pathogenic organisms that
cause damage. The link between improved hygiene and
reduced spread of infection is well established (Aiello and
Larson, 2002). In particular, hand-washing with soap at
speciﬁc junctures (after contact with fecal material or
before contact with food) has been shown to be highly
effective in reducing diarrheal and respiratory infections.
Meta-analyses conducted by Curtis and Cairncross (2003)
and Rabie and Curtis (2006) have demonstrated that
hand-washing with soap reduces the risk of diarrheal
disease in children and adults by 42–47% and acute respi-
ratory infections by 16%. However, the impact of hand-
washing on the biological pathways that link subclinical
infections
and
childhood
growth
faltering
remains
untested (Humphrey, 2009). Could this simple interven-
tion have an additional beneﬁt in also reducing levels of
mucosal damage and immune stimulation? We hypothe-
sized that an increase in hand hygiene would not only
reduce clinical morbidity, but would also lead to a reduc-
tion in mucosal damage, markers of immune stimulation
and ultimately growth faltering in young children. Here
we report results from a small-scale community-based
hand-washing intervention implemented in Kathmandu,
Nepal designed to test this hypothesis for the ﬁrst time.
STUDY BACKGROUND
The importance of mucosal damage, immune stimula-
tion, and early growth faltering has been recently docu-
mented in Nepal. One cross-sectional study documented
very high levels of intestinal permeability among 0- to
60-month-old children in poor areas of Kathmandu (Goto
et al., 2002). Subsequently, a longitudinal study in
younger cohorts of 3- to 18-month-olds was able to demon-
strate prospective associations between mucosal damage
and growth faltering, and evaluate the relative impor-
tance of nutrition and infection pathways responsible for
growth faltering (Panter-Brick et al., 2009). This study
builds on such previous work, with the speciﬁc aim of
evaluating the impact of a hand-washing intervention.
The hand-washing intervention was informed by a sys-
tematic body of work assessing previous community-based
hand-washing
interventions
in
developing
countries
(Curtis et al., 1997, 2001), and was underpinned the
Theory of Planned Behavior (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975)
which focuses on the social and psychological determi-
nants of behavioral change. This theory suggests that
an intention to perform a certain behavior is a product of
the interaction between a person’s attitudes, subjective
norms, and perceptions of self-efﬁcacy. The intervention
thus aimed to promote a positive attitude towards hand-
washing, establish hand-washing as a social norm and
remove barriers that might hinder hand-washing prac-
tices. Informed by qualitative ﬁndings from interviews
and focus groups, the primary motivational message of
the intervention was that washing hands prevents sick-
ness and protects one’s family. However, this was also
backed up by subsidiary messages aimed at changing
attitudes and social norms and creating a ‘‘demand’’ for
hygiene; thus hand-washing was promoted to the mothers
as something that ‘‘good,’’ ‘‘clean,’’ and ‘‘respected’’ moth-
ers do, while also emphasizing the personal beneﬁts of
making them feel fresh and clean and giving them soft,
nice-smelling hands.
METHODS
Study design
We focused this study on a target group of 3- to 12-
month-olds, to capture the critical period of growth falter-
ing (6–18 months) and allow recruitment of children mov-
ing into this age range over the six-month period of study.
We also focused on poor children living in slum settle-
ments, having identiﬁed these children as experiencing
very high levels of mucosal damage, immune stimulation
and growth faltering in a previous study (Panter-Brick
et al., 2009).
Data from this previous study (Panter-Brick et al.,
2009) were used to determine sample size, based on a test
with 80% power, a 95% level of signiﬁcance and a 30%
reduction in levels of mucosal damage, immune stimula-
tion and growth faltering. Sample size was calculated to
be 88 children (44 intervention, 44 control). To mitigate
potential attrition, target sample size was increased to
100 children.
We used the most recently available geographical and
demographic data to identify all existing slum settlements
within Kathmandu (Shrestha and Shrestha, 2005): a total
of 118 settlements were listed, the majority of which were
small settlements of less than 50 households. Because of
Kathmandu’s geographical spread, the logistics of travel-
ing within this overcrowded city, and frequent and unpre-
dictable strikes associated with Nepal’s recent political
upheaval, we focused our study on the largest slum settle-
ments in order to maximize the number of children in the
target age range over the smallest number of ﬁeld sites.
We thus selected the largest slum settlements (n 5 8)
to achieve required sample size, after excluding ﬁve com-
munities that were inaccessible (n 5 3), declined to partic-
ipate (n 5 1), or recently beneﬁted from improvements in
water provision and sanitation (n 5 1). House-to-house
surveys were conducted in each of the selected settle-
ments to determine the number of children in the target
age-range. The mothers of these children were invited to a
recruitment meeting and agreed to participate. The
sampling strategy for this study therefore consisted of a
purposive sampling of the eight largest slum settlements
in Kathmandu, followed by a total sample of children aged
3–12 months living in these communities.
The eight slum settlements under consideration were
divided into two separate groups based on broad geo-
graphical areas (‘‘north’’ and ‘‘east’’) and then randomly
allocated (by ﬂipping a coin) to intervention or control
groups. It was not possible to randomly allocated each

separate settlement to control/intervention conditions as
many sites were situated very close to one another
(e.g., separated by just a road or stream) such that the
intervention message could easily have crossed over into
the control settlements.
The ﬁrst author was present throughout the period of
study, having already codirected 10-months of growth and
biomarker data collection in Kathmandu (Panter-Brick
et al., 2009). The local ﬁeld team consisted of three Nepali
research assistants, helping with the project and acting as
translators where necessary; ﬁve Community Motivators,
well-known
and
respected
women
from
each
study
slum area, responsible for the implementation of the
hand-washing intervention; and 10 ﬁeldworkers, who
after completing a three-week intensive training program,
undertook all structured observations of hand-washing
behavior and collected weekly morbidity data.
Baseline data collection
Structured questionnaires were used to collect demo-
graphic and socio-economic data on all participants,
including data on parental levels of education, the family’s
housing situation and access to certain facilities (such as
sanitation), household income and ownership of valuable
material possessions (such as television, radio, etc). These
data were used to create a composite socio-economic score
for each household.
We assessed base-line hand-washing practices in both
intervention and control sites through structured observa-
tions and questionnaires. Fieldwork assistants undertook
structured observations of hygiene behavior for a random
sample of households (n 5 75), recording the mother’s
hand-washing behavior at ﬁve speciﬁc junctures: (1) after
visiting the toilet, (2) after cleaning the baby’s bottom, (3)
before preparing food, (4) before feeding the baby, and (5)
before eating food. The 3-h observation periods began as
soon as the family woke up, usually at 6 am. To limit reac-
tivity, mothers were told the purpose of the observations
was to learn about the life and work of Nepali women:
hand-washing was never mentioned. Further structured
observations conducted at the end of the study to assess
changes in hand-washing practices were not possible as
mothers in intervention communities would have associ-
ated these observations with the hand-washing interven-
tion, thus biasing any data collected.
Questionnaires were also used to determine mothers’
reported hand-washing behavior. Though reported data
cannot give reliable data on actual practices (Cousens
et al., 1996), they are useful in assessing mothers’ knowl-
edge of when hand-washing should occur. Once base-line
structured observations were completed, the ﬁrst author
implemented a structured questionnaire with all mothers
in intervention and control areas to assess reported hand-
washing on the previous day at the ﬁve key junctures
mentioned above. This questionnaire was repeated at the
end of the intervention period.
Design of hand-washing intervention
To inform the design of the hand-washing intervention,
we conducted both in-depth interviews and focus groups.
In-depth interviews (n 5 26), conducted with a random
selection of the mothers from the intervention group, were
focused on local understandings of child health and
hygiene. These were conducted in Nepali by the ﬁrst
author (RL) with assistance from a research assistant
where necessary. Focus groups (n 5 3), each comprising of
six to eight women, were conducted to discuss these topics
in a group setting. These were moderated by a Nepali
research assistant and lasted between 1.5 and 2 h.
The research team (RL, three Nepali research assis-
tants, and ﬁve community motivators) discussed all avail-
able data generated from the observations, interviews and
focus groups in order to determine the intervention mes-
sage and plan intervention activities. The hand-washing
program was launched in intervention areas at a commu-
nity meeting organized in each local area (June 2007).
This meeting included an interactive educational session,
a discussion led by the Community Motivator, and a short
play, commissioned speciﬁcally for this intervention and
performed by actors from the slum communities.
The intervention was then intensively promoted for six
months. The launch meeting was followed up by daily
home visits by Community Motivators to each mother to
encourage the establishment of a new hand-washing
regime. These visits continued on a daily basis for two
weeks, and then decreased in frequency until the mothers
were visited just once or twice a week throughout the six-
month intervention period. Mothers’ group meetings were
held in each area, with their local Community Motivator,
every two weeks throughout the study period. This pro-
vided the women an opportunity to socialize with one
another, while promoting the hand-washing message. The
Community Motivators distributed a new bar of soap to
each mother at these meetings to encourage hand-wash-
ing practices in the family. In addition, locally designed
posters were distributed to all families in the intervention
areas, as well as being displayed prominently throughout
the settlements.
Health and growth measures
Data collection schedule.
Baseline health and growth
data were collected during May, 2007. Following the
launch of the intervention, monthly health checks (June
to November) were conducted in both intervention and
control areas to assess mucosal damage, immune stimula-
tion, and growth performance. Morbidity reports for each
child were collected on a weekly basis.
Morbidity.
Morbidity data for each child focused on the
most commonly reported symptoms—diarrhea, coughs/
colds, and fevers. Following the WHO (2005), diarrhea
was deﬁned as at least three loose stools in a 24-h period.
Details of any sickness were collected from the children’s
mothers by trained local ﬁeldworkers using a symptom
checklist. To prevent bias in data collection, these ﬁeld-
workers were never involved in any aspect of the program
to promote hand-washing.
Subclinical infection
Mucosal damage.
Mucosal damage was assessed using
the lactose:creatinine urinary test (L:C)—a method which
had been successfully employed in a previous study in
Nepal (Panter-Brick et al., 2009). Breastfed infants ingest
lactose from their mother’s breast milk; in a normal gut
the majority of this sugar is hydrolyzed by the mucosal
623
HAND-WASHING, INFECTIONS, AND GROWTH

enzyme lactase. The resulting monomers are passively
absorbed into the bloodstream; only very small amounts of
undigested
lactose
are
absorbed
into
the
body
and
excreted in the urine. However, pathogenic damage to the
mucosa leads to the loss of lactase resulting in less lactose
being hydrolyzed; thus a greater amount of undigested
lactose will be recovered in the urine. The proportion of
lactose to creatinine in the urine therefore acts as an
index of mucosal damage.
Urine was collected on a sterile urine pad (Newcastle
Urine Collection Pack, Ontex UK Ltd, Corby, UK) placed
inside a locally purchased nappy. Once the child had uri-
nated, the pad was removed and two 2 ml samples of urine
were extracted using a syringe. These samples were pre-
served with one or two drops of bacteriostat (chlorhexidine
digluconate, 2 g/L solution) and then frozen at 2208C
until shipment to the UK. An enzymatic assay (Northrop
et al., 1990) was used to analyze levels of urinary lactose
and a Jaffe technique for creatinine levels (Randox Creati-
nine Assay Kit; Randox, Crumlin, Antrim, UK).
Immune stimulation.
Stimulation of the immune system
was assessed through analysis of protein markers in dried
blood spots—a-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and immuno-
globulin G (IgG)—which both increase as a result of
infection or inﬂammation. In addition, hemoglobin (Hb)
and albumin were measured, providing information on
the nutritional status of the child.
Single-use lancets (Hemocue, Dronﬁeld, Derbyshire,
UK) were used to prick the child’s ﬁnger and obtain the
blood-drop samples. One drop of blood was used to obtain
an on-the-spot hemoglobin result using a hemoglobinome-
ter (Hemocue, Dronﬁeld, Derbyshire, UK). Subsequent
blood drops were collected on 903-protein saver collection
cards (Whatman Plc, Maidstone, Kent, UK). When com-
pletely dry, the cards were sealed in individual zip-lock
bags with desiccant and frozen at 2208C until shipment
to the UK. Samples were analyzed using techniques
described in Panter-Brick et al. (2009).
Growth faltering
Lengths and weights of children were measured using
standard anthropometric techniques, as described by
Lohman et al. (1988). Children were measured by a single
investigator (RL), to the nearest 0.5 cm for length and
0.01 kg for weight, using a SECA stadiometer or weighing
scale (Milton Keynes Scales, Leighton Buzzard, Bedford-
shire, UK). Duplicate measures of length and weight for
20 children were taken to calculate technical errors of
measurement (Ulijaszek and Kerr, 1999) which yielded
coefﬁcients of reliability of 0.99 and 0.98 for weight and
length, respectively.
Ethical approval
Ethical approval was gained from the Nepal Health
Research
Council
and
from
Durham
University’s
Research Ethics Committee. All procedures were demon-
strated to mothers at the start of the study to secure
informed consent. Mothers were offered a small gift
(200 rupees, approximately £1.50) at each monthly mea-
surement to compensate them for their time. At the end
of the study all children were given a gift of clothing and
provided with medical treatment by a local hospital where
appropriate. In addition, mothers in the control group
were invited to attend a session on hygiene and hand-
washing and offered free bars of soap.
Statistical analyses
Height-for-age
(HAZ),
weight-for-age
(WAZ)
and
weight-for-height (WHZ) z-scores were calculated using
Epi Info2 (version 3.3.2) based on the National Centre for
Disease Statistics, 2000 growth curves. Mucosal damage
(L:C) values were normalized by log10 transformation
after adding 020 to each value to prevent negative scores.
Relationships between categorical demographic or socio-
economic variables were assessed using v2 tests, and
between continuous variables by two-tailed independent
t-tests and linear regression. Weekly morbidity scores
were summed to provide morbidity proﬁles for each child
over the whole period of study. These scores were non-
normally distributed and thus were assessed using non-
parametric Mann-Whitney U tests. Data were analyzed
using SPSS for Windows statistical package (versions
14-15; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and Stata (Intercooled)
(Version 8.2; Statacorp, College Station, TX). Statistical
signiﬁcance was set at the 5% level.
Time-series linear regression analysis was used to
assess the impact of the intervention longitudinally, to
account for the interdependence of repeated measures
for each participant and to examine between- and within-
subject variation. We built multivariable models based on
initial univariable analyses to evaluate predictor varia-
bles. Age was included as a covariate in all analyses.
Differences in baseline biochemical variables between
intervention and control groups were controlled for in
regression models. Because we were interested in changes
in biochemical and growth variables over the course of the
intervention, we also tested for interactions between time
and group (intervention/control).
RESULTS
A total of 99 children were recruited into the study, with
88 children providing complete datasets. No differences
between the intervention and control group were observed
for any demographic variable nor for the composite socio-
economic score (Table 1). Over half (53%) of the mothers
in the study were illiterate, while 18% had received
primary level education and 28% had attended at least
some secondary level schooling. Education levels were,
as expected, higher among the fathers: about a quarter
(27%) were illiterate, 21% had received primary school
education and half (52%) had continued to secondary level
education.
Just over half (55%) of the families owned their own
house (but not the deeds to the land), while the rest lived
in rented accommodation. Most houses were simple brick
constructions roofed with corrugated iron sheets, though
some houses were only walled with woven bamboo or plas-
tic sheeting. The houses were generally small, dark and
over-crowded. Over half (57%) of families lived in just one
room, which served as kitchen, bedroom and general liv-
ing area for the entire family. Access to drinking water
was limited in all areas: three settlements had public taps
that provided water for just a few hours on alternate days;
the remaining settlements relied primarily on water from
624

public or private tube wells and deep wells. Water for hy-
gienic purposes, however, was always available from these
tube and deep wells. The majority of families (82%) did
not have access to a private toilet, but instead shared sani-
tary facilities with several families or used public toilets.
Families owned few valuable possessions; a median of just
two items, with almost a quarter (24%) of families owning
none at all. The most common possessions were televi-
sions and radios, with 64% and 50% of families owning
these items, respectively.
Impact on hand-washing practices
Data from the preintervention structured observations
suggested that hand-washing at the ﬁve key junctures
was uncommon. Indeed, so few hand-washing events were
actually observed that we did not conduct statistical com-
parisons between the intervention and control groups.
Only a ﬁfth of mothers were observed to wash hands with
soap after going to the toilet, and just 14% were seen to
wash their hands with soap after cleaning the baby’s bot-
tom. Hand-washing before cooking or feeding the baby
was virtually non-existent (data not shown).
As
expected,
self-reported
rates
of
hand-washing
were much higher than those suggested by observations
(Table 2). At baseline almost all mothers (95%) reported
hand-washing with soap after defecation and over three-
quarters reported using soap after cleaning the baby’s bot-
tom. Hand-washing was reported much less frequently in
both groups before cooking food or feeding the baby and
very infrequently before eating a meal.
By the end of the study, however, reported hand-wash-
ing after cleaning the baby’s bottom or before cooking, eat-
ing or feeding the baby had increased in mothers from the
intervention areas (McNemar’s test, P < 0.01 for all four
junctures), while hand-washing in control areas remained
unchanged (Table 2). Thus, by the end of the study, moth-
ers in the intervention areas were signiﬁcantly more
likely than control mothers to report hand-washing at
these four junctures (P < .01 for all four junctures). Only
for one juncture (‘after visiting the toilet’) was there no
signiﬁcant increase in reported behavior among interven-
tion mothers (P 5 0.50) and no difference in hand-washing
rates between the two groups (P 5 0.053).
Impact on morbidity
Children from intervention areas reported fewer epi-
sodes of diarrhea over the study period (3.0 vs. 4.33 epi-
sodes for intervention and control, respectively; P 5
0.049), experiencing, on average, 31% fewer episodes of di-
arrhea than control counterparts. Intervention children
also experienced 41% fewer days of diarrhea than children
in control areas, (9.67 vs. 16.33 days for intervention and
control groups, respectively; P 5 0.023). There were no
differences between the two groups in episodes or days of
coughs/colds or fevers (Fig. 1a,b).
Associations between biochemical and growth variables
Associations between biochemical and growth variables
are presented in Table 3. Markers of immune stimula-
tion—AGP and IgG—were positively associated with one
another over the study period (P < 0.001). Similarly, he-
moglobin and albumin, showed a weak, but positive corre-
lation (P < 0.001). L:C (mucosal damage) was not associ-
ated with any of the immune or nutritional markers. How-
ever, children with higher levels of mucosal damage over
the period of study had signiﬁcantly lower HAZ (P 5
0.01), WAZ (P < 0.001) and WHZ z-scores (P 5 0.034). Al-
bumin was associated with better WAZ and WHZ scores
over the period of study (P 5 0.001 and P 5 0.002, respec-
tively), while children with higher levels of AGP had
poorer scores for these two variables (P < 0.001 for both).
Elevated levels of IgG, indicative of long-term stimulation
of the immune system, were associated with poorer HAZ
scores (P 5 0.029). Hb showed no association with any
growth variable.
Impact of intervention on biochemical markers
Time series regression analysis revealed no differences
between intervention and control groups with respect to
L:C, AGP, albumin or hemoglobin, after controlling for age
and baseline differences. A signiﬁcant interaction between
group and time was observed for IgG (P 5 0.002, Table 4),
indicating that children in the intervention and control
groups were changing in different ways. IgG levels
increased in both groups, but the slope of the regression
line for the intervention group is steeper, indicating that,
even after correcting for baseline differences, IgG levels
were increasing at a faster rate in the intervention
group (coef. 5 0.621, P < 0.001) than in the control group
(coef. 5 0.237, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2a). However, despite

HAND-WASHING, INFECTIONS, AND GROWTH
American Journal of Human Biology

this difference in trajectory, the two groups were not
signiﬁcantly different from one another (group coef. 5
20.235, P 5 0.56).
Impact of intervention on growth
No differences between intervention and control groups
were detected for HAZ. However, for both WAZ and WHZ,
the two groups changed in different ways over time
(P 5 0.012 and 0.019, respectively for interaction terms,
Table 4). Both groups experienced a decrease in WAZ over
the period of study (Fig. 2b) but children from interven-
tion areas declined at a faster rate than the control group
(coef. 5 20.149 and 20.027, for intervention and control,
respectively). Despite these different trajectories, overall
WAZ scores for the two groups were not signiﬁcantly
different
from
one
another
(group
coef.

20.068,
P 5 0.76). A similar pattern was observed for WHZ
(Fig. 2c). WHZ scores declined at a faster rate in the inter-
vention group (coef. 5 20.079 and 20.034 for intervention
and control, respectively), although the overall difference
between the two groups remained nonsigniﬁcant (group
coef. 5 0.24, P 5 0.16).
DISCUSSION
This study conﬁrms the role of hand-washing as an im-
portant means of preventing diarrheal disease. Children
in the hand-washing areas experienced a signiﬁcant
reduction in diarrheal episodes, resulting in 41% fewer
days of diarrheal symptoms over the period of study than
their control counterparts. The magnitude of this impact
is in line with results reported from other studies (Curtis
and Cairncross, 2003).
This is the ﬁrst study that sought to look beyond the
impact of hand-washing on reported morbidity such as
diarrhea, to examine its impact on subclinical rates of
infection. We found that although the hand-washing inter-
vention signiﬁcantly reduced diarrheal disease in children
from the intervention group, it failed to have an impact on
levels of mucosal damage and immune stimulation that
are associated with poorer growth performance in young
children. No differences were observed between interven-
tion and control children for any biochemical variable, nor
for any growth indicator over the period of study.

Our data therefore appear to suggest that while hand-
washing can reduce more severe forms of infection that
result in diarrheal symptoms, it may have little or no
effect on sub clinical, yet often chronic, forms of infection.
This lack of impact has to be interpreted with caution
given the two main limitations of this study. First, this is
a small-scale prospective study. While we recruited a total
sample of children in the target age-range living in the
eight largest slum settlements of Kathmandu, our sample
size was constrained by the number of target-aged
children available in the communities at the time. We
obtained repeated and multiple measures on a cohort of
88 participants, suffering an attrition rate of only 11 chil-
dren from 99 originally recruited. Second, the interven-
tion was monitored for a six-month period. This was
perhaps not long enough to detect the full impact of
changes in hand-washing practice. However, any reduc-
tion in a child’s exposure to pathogenic organisms should
lead to a fairly swift reduction in immune stimulation
and, in the absence of further pathogenic damage, muco-
sal crypt cells might be expected to regenerate within a
few weeks (Noone et al., 1986). Biochemical indicators
were therefore likely to have been sensitive enough to
detect some impact within the intervention period, yet no
such change was observed. Thus, while a full-scale cluster
randomized controlled trial is required to provide more
conclusive evidence, our results suggest that hand-wash-
ing may have a limited impact on subclinical infections in
young children living in such conditions.
Given the context of the slums, this lack of impact on
sub-clinical infections is perhaps not surprising. Fecal
contamination of the hands is undoubtedly a signiﬁcant
threat to health, and the 41% reduction in days of diar-
rhea in the intervention group conﬁrms its importance as
a highly effective intervention. However, for children liv-
ing in poor slum conditions contamination of the hands is
just one of many pathways by which they are exposed to
pathogenic organisms. In this context children are put at
risk of infection through consumption of bacterially conta-
minated food and water, as well as living in poor quality
and over-crowded environments that promote the rapid
spread of disease. Hand-washing may interrupt one par-
ticular route of transmission, but if children continued to
be exposed to pathogens via a multitude of other path-
ways, it is possible that no signiﬁcant reduction in muco-
sal damage and immune stimulation would occur. Thus,
while hand-washing has the potential to reduce incidence
of acute cases of diarrheal disease, it is perhaps insufﬁ-
cient to affect the daily exposure to infectious organisms
that cause subclinical infection which are a regular part of
life in urban slums.
The inﬂuence of wider environmental conditions on lev-
els of mucosal damage and immune stimulation is also
highlighted in a recent study from Bangladesh. Goto et al.
(2008, 2009) implemented a double-blind randomized con-
trolled trial to test the effects of anti-Giardia and anthel-
minthic treatment on biochemical and growth indicators

HAND-WASHING, INFECTIONS, AND GROWTH
American Journal of Human Biology

in a sample of 222 children aged between 3 and 15
months. Children were assigned to one of four groups
(anti-Giardia,
anthelminthic,
anti-Giardia
1
anthel-
minthic, or placebo) and were followed for 36 weeks. No
signiﬁcant differences for intestinal permeability, bio-
chemical or anthropometric variables were found between
the intervention groups—a surprising ﬁnding given the
number of studies reporting associations between Giardia
and intestinal helminths and poor growth (Crompton and
Nesheim, 2002; Farthing et al., 1986; Gupta and Urrutia,
1982; Oberhelman et al., 1998; Simsek et al., 2004). The
authors, however, point to the high endemicity of Giardia
within this population, suggesting that children were rap-
idly reinfected after treatment due to the very poor stand-
ards of hygiene within these communities. The results
from both this and our own study suggest that behavioral
and pharmacological interventions may be unlikely to
have a signiﬁcant impact on the biochemical and growth
status of children in the absence of more comprehensive
improvements to general living conditions.
To put this into a global context, it is worth reminding
ourselves of the scale of this problem: currently, almost a
billion people in developing countries lack access to safe
water and 2.6 billion lack basic sanitation facilities (WHO,
UNICEF, 2010). In addition, the poorest people often pay
a disproportionately greater amount to use these resour-
ces where they are available. Slum dwellers often pay
between ﬁve to ten times more per liter of water than
richer people living in the same city (UNDP, 2006:10).
Without addressing these structural issues, not only will
it remain difﬁcult for the poorest people to improve their
hand-washing practices, but in the context of signiﬁcant
and persistent environmental contamination that this
lack of access creates, the potential impact of hand-wash-
ing on health may be constrained.
One further aspect of the results from this study
requires comment. While there was no overall difference
between the intervention and control groups for any vari-
able, they did show differences in trajectory for IgG, WAZ,
and WHZ. These divergences were not large enough to
produce signiﬁcant absolute differences between the two
groups, but this may have emerged with a longer observa-
tional period. Unexpectedly, these differences in trajectory
were in the opposite direction to that predicted: IgG levels
rose with age, WAZ and WHZ worsened with age, at a
faster rate in the intervention group relative to controls.
These trends demand careful evaluation.
Could the hand-washing program have had an unex-
pected negative impact on the biochemical and growth
status of children in the intervention group? It is difﬁcult
to envisage a plausible mechanism by which a poorer
trajectory could be attributed to increases in maternal
hand-washing practices. Although it has been suggested
that an exaggerated concern for hygiene can impede the
development of a healthy and functioning immune system
(Strachan, 1989), this has primarily focused on the rise in
atopic diseases such as eczema and asthma in the devel-
oped world (Okada et al., 2010; Sherriff and Golding,
2002) and not the types of infectious disease to which
urban slum children would be exposed.
A more likely scenario is that there was something sig-
niﬁcantly different about the two groups at the start of
the study and it was this difference that continued to
exert pressure on the biochemical and growth status of
children in the intervention areas, despite improvements
in hand-washing practices. This interpretation is sup-
ported by the fact that there were signiﬁcant differences
between the groups at baseline for IgG, AGP, and
albumin. Although these differences were accounted for in
longitudinal analyses, one might expect these differences
between the two groups to persist if whatever factor
caused these differences in the ﬁrst place was unaffected
by the hand-washing intervention.
Some evidence points to subtle differences between
intervention and control areas that may signal greater
socio-economic deprivation in households recruited to the
hand-washing campaign. The groups were comparable
with respect to the composite scale constructed to assess
socio-economic status, yet differed with respect to two par-
ticular items (Table 1). Thus over-crowding was greater in
intervention areas with 69% of intervention families liv-
ing in just one room that served as kitchen, bedroom and
living area, compared with 44% of families in control
areas (P 5 0.02). Intervention families were also more
likely to use the cheapest form of cooking fuel (ﬁre wood)
than controls (68% vs. 23% respectively, P 5 0.02). The
poorer health trajectory of children in the intervention
group may perhaps reﬂect conditions of over-crowding
and
poverty,
leading
to
greater
pathogen
exposure
through pathways unaffected by hand-washing behaviors.
What these results signal is that even within slum com-
munities that are generically thought of as ‘‘poor,’’ there is
signiﬁcant heterogeneity between households and that
slum children are differentially exposed to a wide variety
of stressors (both nutritional and pathological) that can
impact on their health and growth. This emphasizes the
point that growth faltering is a highly complex and multi-
faceted problem which will likely require comprehensive
interventions (tackling environmental sanitation as well
as hygiene behavior) rather than programs that target be-
havioral change alone. Our study underscores previous
work that argues that many carefully conducted health
interventions have limited health impact, even where
wholesale behavioral change to minimize exposure to
pathogenic infections is achieved (Panter-Brick et al.,
2006; Tomlinson et al., 2010).
CONCLUSION
Hand-washing is a highly effective means of reducing
diarrhea in young children; indeed, so effective that it has
been promoted as a ‘‘do-it-yourself’’ vaccine against child-
hood infections (Curtis et al., 2005). However, the results
from our preliminary study suggest that its impact on the
more subtle, yet often chronic, forms of infection may be
limited. For children living in highly contaminated, over-
crowded environments, with poor access to clean water
and sanitation, hand-washing may be necessary, but not
sufﬁcient to reduce levels of subclinical mucosal damage
and immune stimulation that are strongly associated with
growth faltering.
From the standpoint of human biology and health, what
are needed are comprehensive, structural interventions
that address the root causes of these infections—poverty
and poor living conditions. Focusing attention solely on
hygiene interventions that target individual behaviors, in
the context of recurrent infections in slum environments
and in the absence of improvements to wider living condi-
tions, may have limited global and local health impacts.
