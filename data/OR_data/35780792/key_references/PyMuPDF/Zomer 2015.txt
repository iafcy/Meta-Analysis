SUMMARY
Infections are common in children attending daycare centres (DCCs). We evaluated the effect
of a hand hygiene (HH) intervention for caregivers on the incidence of gastrointestinal and
respiratory infections in children. The intervention was evaluated in a two-arm cluster
randomized controlled trial. Thirty-six DCCs received the intervention including HH products,
training sessions, and posters/stickers. Thirty-ﬁve control DCCs continued usual practice.
Incidence of episodes of diarrhoea and the common cold in children was monitored by parents
during 6 months. Using multilevel Poisson regression, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95%
conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were obtained. Diarrhoeal incidence was monitored in 545 children for
91 937 days. During follow-up, the incidence was 3·0 episodes per child-year in intervention
DCCs vs. 3·4 in control DCCs (IRR 0·90, 95% CI 0·73–1·11). Incidence of the common cold was
monitored in 541 children for 91 373 days. During follow-up, the incidence was 8·2 episodes per
child-year in intervention DCCs vs. 7·4 in control DCCs (IRR 1·07, 95% CI 0·97–1·19). In this
study, no evidence for an effect of the intervention was demonstrated on the incidence of
episodes of diarrhoea and the common cold.

INTRODUCTION
Children attending daycare centres (DCCs) acquire
gastrointestinal and respiratory infections more often
than children cared for at home [1, 2]. Hand hygiene
(HH) is considered to be a simple and effective measure
to prevent infections [3, 4]. However, in DCCs care-
givers’ compliance with HH guidelines is low [5].
Although several HH interventions have been
developed to reduce DCC-related infections [6–14],
inconsistent results on their effectiveness have been
reported [15]. Moreover, these interventions were not
reported as being developed according to a stepwise
behavioural approach using models and theories from
the behavioural sciences to understand the determi-
nants that underlie HH behaviour [16]. Our previous re-
search showed that environmental determinants, such

as the availability of paper towels, are associated with
caregivers’ HH compliance in DCCs [5]. In addition,
we found that the following sociocognitive determinants
are associated with HH compliance of DCC caregivers:
knowledge and awareness of HH guidelines, perceived
importance of performing HH, perceived behavioural
control (i.e. perceived ease or difﬁculty of performing
the behaviour), and habit [17]. Interventions aiming to
improve caregivers’ HH compliance in DCCs are more
likely to be successful when addressing these determi-
nants. We therefore developed an intervention based
on these sociocognitive and environmental determinants
ofcaregivers’HH behaviour.The aimofthe intervention
was to increase caregivers’ compliance with HH guide-
lines (primary outcome measure) and reduce infections
in children (secondary outcome measure). Due to the in-
tervention, caregivers’ compliance with HH guidelines
improved. Compliance was deﬁned as the number of
HH actions divided by the total number of opportu-
nities for which HH was indicated. According to the
Dutch national guidelines, HH is mandatory for
caregivers before touching/preparing food, before care-
givers themselves ate or assisted children with eating,
and before wound care; and after diapering, after
toilet use/wiping buttocks, after caregivers themselves
coughed/sneezed/wiped their own nose, after contact
with body ﬂuids (e.g. saliva, vomit, urine, blood, or
mucus when wiping children’s noses), after wound
care, and after hands were visibly soiled [18]. HH com-
pliance was observed at 1, 3 and 6 months follow-up.
At 6 months follow-up, caregivers’ HH compliance in
intervention DCCs was 59% vs. 44% in control DCCs
(baseline-corrected OR 4·13, 95% CI 2·33–7·32) (T. P.
Zomer et al., unpublished data). The effect of our in-
tervention on HH compliance will be described in a
forthcoming paper. In this paper we assess the effect
of our intervention on incidence of gastrointestinal
and respiratory infections in children attending DCCs.
METHODS
A cluster randomized controlled trial of a HH inter-
vention was performed in DCCs in the regions of
Rotterdam-Rijnmond, Gouda and Leiden in The
Netherlands between September 2011 and April
2012. DCCs were randomized, stratiﬁed for size and
urbanicity [19]. DCCs which participated in our pre-
vious study on HH determinants [5, 17], were con-
tacted to participate in the trial.
The intervention consisted of four components [19].
First, the following HH products were provided free
of charge: dispensers for paper towels, soap, alcohol-
based hand sanitizer and hand cream, with reﬁlls for
6 months. Second, training about the Dutch national
HH guidelines was given and a booklet outlining
the content of the training was distributed. Third,
two team training sessions were given aimed at goal-
setting and formulating speciﬁc HH improvement
activities. The team training sessions were based on
similar HH training sessions developed for Dutch hos-
pitals [20, 21]. Fourth, posters and stickers for both
caregivers and children were provided as reminders
and cues to action. Two groups in each DCC partici-
pated in the study. In intervention DCCs, these groups
received the HH products. As caregivers rotated be-
tween groups, all caregivers received the training ses-
sions. The intervention was implemented in four
phases (HH products at the start, three training ses-
sions with a 1-month interval). Intervention DCCs
were compared to control DCCs which continued
their usual practice.
The outcome measure was incidence of gastrointes-
tinal and respiratory infections in children monitored
by parents. Parents were enrolled in the trial between
1 August 2011 and 1 November 2011. Baseline
measurement was collected between mid-September
2011 until 1 November 2011; starting when parents
were enrolled and ending when the intervention
started.
Follow-up
measurement
was
from
1 November 2011 until the end of March 2012.
Children were recruited from two groups of the
DCC, even if the DCC had more than two groups
in total. In that case, in both intervention and control
DCCs the researchers in collaboration with the man-
agers of the DCCs randomly selected two groups.
Parents were recruited from 142 (48%) groups out of
a total of 297 groups. Children were eligible to partici-
pate if they: attended the DCC at least 2 days a week;
were aged between 6 months and 3·5 years at start of
the trial; intended to attend the DCC throughout the
study period; and if their parents consented, were
Dutch speaking, and had access to email or regular
post. Children were excluded if they had a chronic ill-
ness or medication that predisposed them to infection,
a sibling taking part in the trial (i.e. one child per fam-
ily could be included), or if they started attending the
DCC after start of the trial.
Parents were asked to monitor disease incidence in
their child using an infection calendar to mark the
days their child had diarrhoea and/or a common
cold. Diarrhoea was deﬁned as at least two watery
or unusually loose stools in 24 h. The common cold

was deﬁned as a blocked or runny nose with at least
one of the following symptoms: coughing, sneezing,
fever, sore throat, or earache. Every 2 weeks, parents
were contacted by email and regular post to enter the
calendar page in an online version of the calendar or
to send it in using a free-of-charge return envelope.
Parents who did not respond were reminded after 1
week (email), 2 weeks (letter), and 3 weeks (tele-
phone). Sample size calculation showed that to be
able to detect 25% reduction in incidence of gastroin-
testinal infections of three per year and 15% reduction
in incidence of respiratory infections of nine per year,
we would need disease monitoring of 600 children for
6 months (80% power, two-sided alpha of 0·05) [19].
In order to interpret results we assessed exposure to
the intervention. We observed whether the inter-
vention dispensers and posters/stickers were in use at
6 months’ follow-up. In addition, a survey was con-
ducted among caregivers.
Data were analysed using SPSS version 19 (SPSS
Inc., USA) and R version 2.12.2 (R Foundation,
Austria). Analyses were performed according to the
intention-to-treat principle, i.e. including all inter-
vention DCCs irrespective of whether they used the
HH products, posters/stickers or completed all train-
ing sessions. First, baseline characteristics were com-
pared
using
χ2
test
or
Fisher’s
exact
test
for
categorical variables and independent t test for con-
tinuous variables. Second, the incidence of diarrhoea
and the common cold was calculated during baseline
and follow-up in intervention and control DCCs.
Incidence was deﬁned as the number of disease episodes
per child-year. A new disease episode was deﬁned after
seven symptom-free days and in additional analyses
after three symptom-free days [9]. Episodes of illness
which started on the ﬁrstdayparents started monitoring
disease incidence were excluded.
Multilevel Poisson regression analyses were per-
formed to correct for clustering of the data within
DCCs. Incidence risk ratios (IRRs) with 95% conﬁ-
dence intervals (CIs) were obtained for the inter-
vention effect, corrected for DCC group type (0–1,
2–3, 0–4 years), as this was the only possible confoun-
der that was shown to be signiﬁcantly different be-
tween intervention and control DCCs/children at
baseline. Besides overall incidence, incidence was cal-
culated stratiﬁed for children aged 0–1 and 2–3 years.
Tests for overdispersion were performed, but no cor-
rections were necessary.
Additional analyses were performed to correct for
baseline measurement. For this we calculated the
interaction between intervention status of the DCC
(i.e. intervention vs. control) and follow-up measure-
ment (i.e. baseline vs. follow-up). This resulted in an
IRR for the difference between baseline and follow-up
measurement in intervention DCCs and an IRR for
the difference between baseline and follow-up in con-
trol DCCs. Comparison of these two IRRs resulted in
a baseline-corrected IRR.
Ethical approval was waived by the Medical Ethics
Committee of the Erasmus University Medical Centre
in Rotterdam (MEC-2011–256).
RESULTS
In the trial 71 DCCs participated. After randomiza-
tion, there were 36 intervention DCCs and 35 control
DCCs. Of 1981 parents invited to participate, 766
gave informed consent for their child (response rate
39%) (Fig. 1). Of 766 children, 553 were eligible for in-
clusion. Of 553 children, ﬁve parents did not return
any of the calendar pages with incidence data and
three parents did not return any pages during follow-
up, therefore 545 children were included in the analy-
ses. For 19 of 545 children, baseline incidence data
were missing.
Of the 545 children, 278 (51%) were in 34 inter-
vention DCCs and 267 (49%) in 35 control DCCs.
The median number of participating children per
DCC was seven (range 1–18). Of the 545 parents,
94% returned 512 of 14 calendar pages. Com-
parison of baseline characteristics demonstrated that
the group type signiﬁcantly differed between inter-
vention and control DCCs (Table 1). This variable
was therefore included in further analyses as a possible
confounder. None of the other baseline characteristics
was signiﬁcantly different between intervention and
control DCCs and children (Table 1).
Intervention exposure
All 36 intervention DDCs received the training on HH
guidelines and all, but two, received at least one of the
team training sessions. Another two intervention
DCCs did not use any of the provided HH products.
The response rate to the questionnaire on intervention
exposure was 50% (274/546). Of 274 caregivers, 79%
attended at least one of the training sessions. The in-
formation booklet on HH guidelines was received by
77% of caregivers. At 6 months follow-up, the dispen-
sers for paper towels, soap, alcohol-based hand saniti-
zer, and hand cream were used in at least one of two

groups in respectively 94%, 89%, 86%, and 45% of in-
tervention DCCs. Moreover, in 86% the posters were
used and in 74% the stickers.
Incidence of episodes of diarrhoea and the common cold
Incidence of episodes of diarrhoea was monitored in
545 children during 91 937 days. Incidence of episodes
of the common cold was monitored in 541 children dur-
ing 91 373 days. Of 545 children, four children were
excluded from analyses because they had the common
cold every day during the trial. Figure 2 shows the inci-
dence of episodes of diarrhoea and the common cold
in intervention and control DCCs over time; the crude
incidence of diarrhoeal episodes differed between inter-
vention and control DCCs at baseline, while during
follow-up it was similar. Concerning the crude inci-
dence of episodes of the common cold, at baseline as
well as follow-up this was similar for intervention and
control DCCs (except for November).
When deﬁning a new episode of diarrhoea after
seven symptom-free days, the incidence in intervention
DCCs
at
baseline
was
3·0
diarrhoeal
episodes
per child-year vs. 5·1 in control DCCs (Table 2).
Corrected for group type and clustering of the data
within DCCs, this difference was statistically signiﬁ-
cant (IRR 0·57, 95% CI 0·38–0·85). During follow-up
there were 3·0 diarrhoeal episodes per child-year in in-
tervention DCCs vs. 3·4 in control DCCs (IRR 0·90,
95% CI 0·73–1·11). The baseline-corrected IRR was
1·58 (95% CI 1·05–2·36). Additional analyses stratiﬁed
by age, showed similar results during follow-up for
children aged 0–1 year (IRR 0·97, 95% CI 0·75–
1·26; baseline-corrected IRR 1·82, 95% CI 1·08–
3·08) and children aged 2–3 years old (IRR 0·83,
95% CI 0·63–1·09; baseline-corrected IRR 1·29, 95%
CI 0·68–2·43) (results not shown in table). Analyses
with
a new disease episode
deﬁned after three
symptom-free days, showed that uncorrected for base-
line incidence there were slightly fewer episodes of di-
arrhoea in intervention vs. control DCCs (IRR 0·81,
95% CI 0·63–1·05, P = 0·07) (Table 2).
When deﬁning a new episode of the common cold
after seven symptom-free days, the incidence in inter-
vention DCCs at baseline was 9·8 episodes of the com-
mon cold per child-year vs. 9·2 in control DCCs (IRR
1·06, 95% CI 0·85–1·34) (Table 3). During follow-up
there were 8·2 episodes of the common cold in inter-
vention DCCs vs. 7·4 in control DCCs (IRR 1·07,
95% CI 0·97–1·19; baseline-corrected IRR 1·01, 95%
CI 0·79–1·29). Additional analyses stratiﬁed by age,
showed similar results during follow-up for children
aged 0–1 year (IRR 1·07, 95% CI 0·93–1·22; baseline-
corrected IRR 1·13, 95% CI 0·80–1·61) and children

0·95–1·27;

(results not shown in table). Analyses with a new dis-
ease episode deﬁned after three symptom-free days,
showed similar results as analyses with a new disease
episode after seven symptom-free days (IRR 1·04,
95% CI 0·95–1·13; baseline-corrected IRR 1·05, 95%
CI 0·84–1·33) (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
This is the ﬁrst HH intervention in DCCs developed
according to a stepwise behavioural approach target-
ing the underlying determinants of caregivers’ com-
pliance with HH guidelines. The study objective was
to evaluate the effect of the intervention on the inci-
dence of episodes of diarrhoea and the common
cold in children attending DCCs. During follow-up,
there were fewer episodes of diarrhoea in intervention
DCCs vs. control DCCs. However, this difference was
not statistically signiﬁcant and corrected for baseline
the effect changed direction, with signiﬁcantly more
diarrhoeal episodes in intervention DCCs. This was
primarily inﬂuenced by an unexplainable high base-
line incidence in control DCCs. No effect of the inter-
vention was shown on the incidence of episodes of the
common cold.
Our study has several strengths. This is the ﬁrst HH
intervention in DCCs which was developed based on
the underlying determinants of HH behaviour. In ad-
dition, this is one of few DCC intervention studies
correcting for baseline incidence in multilevel analy-
ses. Other strengths of the study are the randomized
controlled design, a large sample size of 71 DCCs,
high exposure to intervention components, and a
high percentage of calendar pages returned by parents
with few children lost to follow-up. In addition, con-
trol DCCs received the intervention after data collec-
tion, which probably facilitated DCC recruitment and
also minimized loss to follow-up [7].
Our study has several limitations. First, as the re-
sponse of parents was initially limited, there were
not enough children included when starting baseline
measurement. Therefore, recruitment of parents con-
tinued during baseline measurement. As a result, the
number of days that parents completed the infection
calendar during baseline varies. For four children,
no baseline data were provided by the parents.
Moreover, the exact weeks that baseline data were col-
lected vary between the children, which might lead
to incomparable results due to different circulating
pathogens. An additional complicating factor is that

half of intervention DCCs, due to practical reasons,
had already received the training on HH guidelines
while baseline measurement was still ongoing. For
children of these DCCs, we censored the calendar
days from the day of the training until the ofﬁcial in-
tervention start on 1 November 2011. As a result,
more baseline data were collected in control DCCs
vs. intervention DCCs. The above-mentioned limita-
tions of the baseline measurement might partly ex-
plain the baseline difference between intervention
and control DCCs in incidence of episodes of diar-
rhoea. Another limitation is that our study is under-
powered. According to sample size calculations, we
would have needed disease monitoring of 600 children
for 6 months (109 200 child-days) [19]. We monitored
545 children during 5 months follow-up, resulting in
data on 79 725 child-days, which is 73% of the antici-
pated 109 200 child-days. Furthermore, the possible ef-
fect size of the intervention is probably smaller than
what we assumed during sample size calculation.
Other limitations are that the method to assess disease
incidence was not validated, and the relatively low
response rate in parents of 39%. No information was
obtained on parents unwilling to participate. It might
be that these parents have less interest in hygiene
which could have inﬂuenced disease incidence at child
DCCs and possibly also the intervention effect.
In the same trial we also assessed caregivers’ HH
compliance at baseline and follow-up, and found
that HH compliance increased signiﬁcantly in inter-
vention vs. control DCCs (T. P. Zomer et al., unpub-
lished data). At baseline, compliance in intervention
DCCs was 53% vs. 63% in control DCCs (OR 0·59,
95% CI 0·37–0·94). At 6 months follow-up, com-
pliance was 59% vs. 44%, respectively (baseline-
corrected OR 4·13, 95% CI 2·33–7·32). Nevertheless,
we were unable to demonstrate an effect of the inter-
vention on incidence of episodes of diarrhoea and
the common cold. This might partly be explained by
the fact that on average the children attended the
DCCs 2·7 days a week and children can also become
infected outside the DCC. In The Netherlands it is
common that at least one of the parents works part-
time and therefore it is not surprising that the children

attending daycare centres (DCCs).

only attend the DCC part-time. Another explanation
could be that within DCCs other hygiene activities
are also important for the prevention of disease trans-
mission (i.e. cleaning toys, ﬂoors, furniture, toilets,
etc.). Furthermore, in our study the main focus was
on caregivers’ HH; besides posters and stickers for
children, there were no other techniques to encourage
children’s HH, even though their HH might also be
important to reduce infections in DCCs. Another
possible explanation is that HH compliance did not
improve enough in intervention DCCs to result in a
reduction in infections, or that the difference in HH
compliance between intervention and control DCCs
was not large enough to detect differences in disease
incidence. There is possibly a critical threshold for
HH compliance to result in a lower incidence of infec-
tions. A Dutch study on DCC-related disease burden,
during the same time period as our intervention
showed a peak in incidence of gastroenteritis in
February 2012 [22]. In our control DCCs there was
the same increase in incidence, while this was not
the case in intervention DCCs. Therefore, it might
be
that
with
an
increase
of
infections,
the
intervention becomes more effective.
Our study shows the importance of baseline mea-
surements in intervention studies, as baseline inci-
dence
of
diarrhoeal
episodes
differed
between
intervention and control DCCs. There are few other
DCC intervention studies which performed a baseline
measurement [6–8, 13]. One of these studies per-
formed analyses to assess whether the difference be-
tween
baseline
and
follow-up
was
different
for
intervention vs. control DCCs [8]. As we found a sign-
iﬁcant difference between intervention and control
DCCs in diarrhoeal baseline incidence, we corrected
the effect of the intervention for baseline incidence.

This was done by adding an interaction term to assess
whether the difference between baseline and follow-up
was different for intervention vs. control DCCs. By
adding this interaction term, we were still able to
also correct for group type and clustering of the
data within DCCs. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst study to perform this type of analysis. More
DCC intervention studies are needed with baseline
measurement.
Previous HH intervention studies in DCCs have
shown varying effects on incidence of gastrointestinal
and/or respiratory infections and/or illness absentee-
ism [15]. We found three randomized controlled trials
with an outcome measure of incidence of gastrointes-
tinal and/or respiratory infections that corrected for
clustering of the data [6, 9, 10, 13]. Gudnason et al.
also reported a baseline measurement and, similar to
our study, did not demonstrate an effect of their inter-
vention on incidence of diarrhoea and colds [6].
Roberts and colleagues reported a reduction in epi-
sodes of colds only in children aged 424 months
and a reduction in episodes of diarrhoea only in chil-
dren aged >24 months [9, 10]. However, in that study
no baseline incidence was reported. Therefore, it is
possible that the difference between intervention and
control DCCs was already present before start of
the intervention. Carabin et al. report that their
intervention reduced the incidence of upper respirat-
ory tract infections [13]. However, similar to our
study, they also report a reduction in incidence
in control DCCs. Therefore, it is less likely that
the incidence reduction in intervention DCCs is
caused by the intervention. This indicates that there
is limited evidence available that improved HH in
DCCs is associated with fewer gastrointestinal and
respiratory infections. More evidence is needed to
understand the importance of HH in reducing gastro-
intestinal
and
respiratory
infections
in
children
attending DCCs.
In conclusion, this study shows that there is no evi-
dence that our HH intervention – addressing determi-
nants that underlie caregivers’ HH behaviour – is
effective in reducing gastrointestinal and respiratory
infections in children attending DCCs. An expla-
nation might be that HH compliance did not increase
enough to result in fewer infections and/or that other
transmission routes are also important, such as other
hygiene/cleaning activities within the DCC as well as
children’s HH. Future intervention studies should tar-
get several transmission routes and be evaluated in ro-
bust studies including baseline measurement.
