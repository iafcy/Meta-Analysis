Abstract 
A social marketing approach used both qualitative 
and quantitative 
methods to develop a hygiene behav- 
iour intervention 
in rural north-east Thailand. Behaviours were preselected from a previous study and the 
intervention 
was designed to promote hand washing, especially before feeding a baby, cooking, eating, and 
after defaecation or cleaning a baby’s bottom, and dish washing immediately 
after eating. A bacteriological 
indicator (enumerating 
faecal streptococci using a finger impression technique) was developed to measure 
changes in hand washing behaviour and observation (spot checks) of dirty dishes to indicate dish washing 
practice. There was a significant improvement 
in both behaviours and a significant reduction in diarrhoeal 
disease as a result of the intervention. 
Furthermore, 
both indicators were retrospectively 
found to be posi- 
tively related to diarrhoeal disease incidence. However, receiving and being able to recall the intervention 
messages was not necessarily sufficient to ensure behaviour 
change, as some adults found it difficult 
to 
change old habits. Villages showing the greatest improvement 
tended to have a stronger sense of commu- 
nity than others and to have more people actively involved in the intervention.

Introduction 
Hygiene behaviour is receiving increasing attention as 
an important 
strategy for preventing 
faecal-oral disease 
transmission 
in developing 
countries. However, educa- 
tion programmes are notorious for generating long lists 
of ‘good’ behaviours 
in the hope that these will 
be 
adopted by the target group and consequently lead to a 
reduction in disease transmission. LOEVINSHOHN (1990) 
suggested that successful health education depends on 
using few messages of proven benefit, repeatedly and in 
many forums. Unfortunately, 
the evidence and docu- 
mentation 
describing the effectiveness of health educa- 
tion programmes 
remains weak (FEACHEM, 1984; LO- 
EVINSHOHN, 1990). This 
has also led to a lack of 
empirical 
evidence for selecting the behaviours that are 
most effective in disrupting 
disease transmission in any 
given environment. 
There is an obvious need to study how and why peo- 
ple behave, so as to understand the socio-economic and 
cultural 
influences 
which 
affect hygiene 
behaviour 
(BOOT & CAIRNCROSS, 1993). Qualitative 
information 
obtained by open interviews and observations is crucial 
to this process (PATTON, 1990), but behaviour is notori- 
ously difficult to measure quantitatively. 
Although ques- 
tionnaire type interviews may be useful for obtaining in- 
formation about knowledge, evidence suggests that they 
lead to over-reporting 
of ‘good’ behaviours (STANTON et 
al., 1987; CURTIS et al., 1993). Structured observations 
made by continuous monitoring 
have been successfully 
applied to interventions 
involving 
behaviour 
modifica- 
tion (STANTON & CLEMENS,I~~~;BENTLEY etal., 1990). 
However! this method is time consuming, 
difficult 
to 
standardize and requires a great deal of skill in design to 
avoid reactivity. Consequently, there is a need to develop 
simple indicators of behaviour. 
Materials 
and Methods 
Site and study outline 
The study was conducted in Khon Kaen province in 
north-eastern Thailand, the largest and poorest region of 
the country. Most of the population 
live in rural villages 
which are fairly cohesive clusters of 60 to about 200 
homes. Poor soils and unreliable patterns of rainfall have 
led to a low-risk 
approach 
to farming 
and a large 
number of people rely on seasonal migrant work to sup- 
plement their income. Typically, 
villagers rely on a vari- 
ety of water sources for their domestic needs. Water

from conveniently 
located tube wells is commonly used 
for washing activities. 
However, much of the ground- 
water is saline and rarely used for drinking because of its 
adverse taste. Artificial 
ponds provide softer water and 
are sometimes preferred for specific washing activities. 
Drinking 
water is traditionally 
supplied by shallow wells 
located in special sites outside the village. 
However, 
rainwater 
harvesting 
has developed dramatically 
over 
the last decade and, when abundant, this is used for both 
drinking 
and washing activities. Pour-flush toilets have 
also proved popular and estimates suggest 70-80% cover- 
age. 
Although mortality 
rates from diarrhoeal disease have 
diminished 
in Thailand 
due to effective measures for 
treatment, morbidity 
rates are still high. Over the past 
decade, there has been a sustained effort to improve the 
health network in rural areas. All subdistricts now have 
a clinic staffed by trained personnel and most districts 
contain a hospital. In each village, there are volunteer

EVALUATING 
HYGIENE 
BEHAVIOUR 
INTERVENTION 
367 
village health workers (VHW) who generally assist clinic 
staff in their work. 
This study comprised 2 main parts. Initially, 
a case 
study phase was used to formulate the hygiene interven- 
tion, train workers, and develop simple indicators of hy- 
giene behaviour. The information 
obtained was used to 
design 
an intervention 
study 
able 
to demonstrate 
changes in the behavioural 
indicators, rather than diar- 
rhoeal disease. However, data on diarrhoeal disease were 
readily available and this information 
was used to select 
subdistricts for the study. 
Subdistricts 
in Khon Kaen province were ranked by 
their incidence rate of diarrhoeal disease as recorded by 
health services. Those containing 
large towns and dis- 
trict hospitals were excluded, and the 6 remaining, with 
the highest rates, were selected for the study. The inter- 
vention was varied in terms of cost (high oriow) 
and ad- 
ministered to 25 villanes in 4 subdistricts IFiaure). Ran- 
dom allocation was o&ridden 
by logical conzderations, 
2 districts containing a pair of subdistricts each being as- 
signed to the intervention. 
The remaining 
12 villages in 
2 subdistricts 
from separate districts were assigned to 
the control. A sample of homes (random sampling pro- 
vided at least 20% of homes in each villages) from 3 of 6 
villages in each subdistrict 
were subjected to the hand 
washing indicator and the questionnaires 
for measuring 
message knowledge. All homes in the 37 villages were 
subjected to the dish washing indicator (see ‘Monitoring 
instruments’, 
below). 
Selection of behaviours 
Two hygiene behaviours had previously been selected 
in a study investigating 
the relationship 
between human 
behaviour 
and faecal contamination 
within 
the home 
(PINFOLD, 
1990a, 1990b), which showed contamination 
of all water sources to be far less than that found in the 
home. Furthermore, 
comparing 
bacterial 
levels from 
stored water and fingertips 
with observed behaviour, 
food handling 
and other cooking-related 
activities were 
found to be associated with much higher levels of con- 
tamination 
than drinking-related 
activities. In selecting 
behaviours 
the following 
conditions 
were considered: 
messages should be simple and few in number; behav- 
iours should already be practised by at least some mem- 
bers of the community 
(thus ensuring 
acceptability); 
and behaviour change should require very little extra ef- 
fort or cost. Cooking and eating utensils were often left 
to soak, thus providing 
a favourable 
environment 
for 
bacterial 
growth. During 
food-related 
activities, 
cross- 
contamination 
was identified 
as the major mechanism 
for transmitting 
faecal bacteria. Thus, only the 2 follow- 
Table 1. Details of intervention 
costs 
ing behaviours were identified. 
(i) Dish washing: emphasizing 
dish washing immedi- 
ately after, rather than before, meal times. 
(ii) Hand washing: emphasizing hand washing before 
feeding a baby, cooking or eating, and after defaecation 
or cleaning a baby’s bottom. 
Description of the intervention 
During the case study phase, a mixture of qualitative 
and quantitative 
methods was used to collect informa- 
tion about hygiene practice and develop a strategy for 
socially marketing 
the behaviours. 
Diarrhoeal 
disease 
was not stressed in the messages, as it was rarely men- 
tioned as a problem 
unless prompted. 
Most villagers, 
apart from health workers, connected those behaviours 
with 
cleanliness 
(religiously 
associated with 
spiritual 
cleansing) and avoiding ‘germs’ (locally defined as invis- 
ible bodies causing illness or bringing 
bad spirits). 
Therefore, 
the communication 
strategy was based on 
these terms, with the added incentive of strong healthy 
children, 
as this was identified 
as a high 
priority 
amongst parents. Use of soap was not emphasized too 
strongly for fear of alienating poorer families. 
For the intervention 
study phase, a variety of media 
(posters, stickers, 
leaflets, comic books, songs, slide 
shows, T-shirts, badges) was developed to create aware- 
ness and support activities 
promoting 
the behaviours. 
All printed media were illustrated, 
so messages could be 
understood by the illiterate, and a project ‘logo’ provided 
continuity. 
Songs about the hygiene messages were re- 
corded in the traditional 
folk music, and tapes of this, as 
well as a community-produced 
play, were broadcast 
through village loudspeakers. The slide show demon- 
strated the effect of hand washing on ‘germs’ similar to 
those used in other media. Bacterial plates were handed 
round after the show to help stimulate more discussion. 
Plastic containers with taps were developed to facilitate 
hand washing in the home. These were distributed 
to 
homes with young children (< 5 years of age) but only in 
those intervention 
villages (in both high cost and low 
cost schemes) subjected to the hand washing indicator. 
The high cost intervention 
received a greater amount 
and variety 
of communication 
materials than the low 
cost scheme, in which slide shows and comic books were 
not included. A free sample of soap was provided with 
the leaflets to villagers in the hieh cost area. The costs 
shown in Table 1 ire 
for this siecific 
research study, 
where a variety of media was tested, and it should be 
noted that actual costs are likely to be much lower for a 
large scale intervention, 
especially if the existing health 
infrastructure 
is effectively 
utilized.

tainer cost about UK &4.00 to produce, but this was not 
included in Table 1 as only a small selection of the 
homes received these containers. 
At the beginning of the intervention phase, school 
and village delegates were invited to workshops at the 
subdistrict level, to discuss project aims and examples 
of promotion activities. Participants were then invited to 
generate their own ideas during 
‘brainstorming’ 
sessions. Two staff members were assigned to each sub- 
district for a period of 3 to 6 months and arranged fur- 
ther meetings in each of the villages and schools under 
their responsibility. The workshops were designed to 
stimulate community involvement in the planning and 
implementation of the communication strategy. Al- 
though the main target was the maternal heads of the 
households and mothers of young children, other family 
members were not excluded. 
A participatory approach in villages proved less effec- 
tive and more difficult to organize than that in primary 
schools. Although pupils were not the main target 
group, it was hoped that they could be influential as 
agents of change in their homes. The most successful 
school activities were constructing dish washing and 
hand washing facilities suited to the type of school water 
supply, and drawing competitions (in conjunction with 
art classes), with the best posters being displayed in the 
villages. The actual involvement of villagers depended 
more on individual 
personalities than official roles. 
Wherever possible, village activities were adjusted to 
stimulate interaction amongst villagers-e.g., 
the or- 
ganization, preparation and distribution of media. 
Monitoring instruments 
Questionnaires. A simple questionnaire was developed 
to measure message reception and recall. Questions on 
the content of the messages were worded so as to elimi- 
nate leading questions and bias. Two separate questions 
were asked for hand washing: ‘before/after which activi- 
ties do you think you should wash hands?’ Respondents 
were prompted for 2 answers per question, thus provid- 
ing a maximum of 4 correct answers: before cooking and 
eating, and after defaecation and cleaning a baby’s bot- 
tom. For washing dishes, the question was simply: 
‘should you wash dishes immediately before or after eat- 
ing? 
Indicators of behaviour. Since hand washing, in this 
context? is concerned with preventing faeco-oral disease 
transmission, a microbiological indicator was developed 
which involved examining the fingertips for the pres- 
ence of transient faecal indicator bacteria. Faecal strep- 
tococci were preferred because Escherichia coli is short- 
lived on the skin and its inability to survive remote cross 
contamination makes it an unsuitable indicator of hand 
washing practice (KALTERNTHALER 
& PINFOLD, 
1995). 
Previously, a finger-rinse technique had been devel- 
oped to determine the number of bacteria on fingertips 
(PINFOLD et al:, 1988). This method was simplified to a 
finger impression technique. Each fingertip was pressed 
directly on to KF Streptococcus agar plates (9 cm diame- 
ter), which are large enough to sample both hands, leav- 
ing 10 prints. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h and 
enumerated by counting the number of prints contain- 
ing faecal streptococci. As this was a novel technique, 
particular attention was paid to the strain of organisms 
grown. Staphylococcus colonies, a common contaminant, 
were sometimes visually indistinguishable from Strepto- 
coccus, and were identified by their ability to produce gas 
from hydrogen peroxide. 
Although hand washing is an individual activity, the 
local environment and practices of other household 
members may also affect hand contamination. During 
the case study phase, finger impression samples were 
taken from 45 families visited on 4 occasions over a pe- 
riod of 6 weeks. Analysis of variance showed the vari- 
ance within families to be far less than that between 
families (P<O.OOOl). No apparent influence was detected 
of sex, age, or number of family members. Therefore, it 
was decided to produce a household index where the 
mean fingertip counts (O-10) of at least 3 family mem- 
bers represented the whole’ family (thus prov:ding a 
more normal distribution). In the results section. FSB 
(‘faecal streptococci before’) refers to this index before 
intervention and FSA (‘faecal streptococci after’) refers 
to the index after the intervention was completed. To 
help reduce daily variability, all sampling during the in- 
tervention study phase was conducted in the evening 
when most people were at home. 
In contrast to hand washing, dish washing behaviour 
can be easily assessed by the presence of dirty dishes. 
This greatly facilitated data collection, as the outcome 
could be readily defined and it took only a few minutes 
to check each home. Continuous observation of dish 
washing behaviour, meal times, and number of dishes 
washed-on each occasion helped to refine this method 
and validate the indicator. More dishes were left dirtv in 
the afternoon, but this also depended on whether there 
were people present during the day. To help control for 
this effect, all subsequent checks were conducted during 
the morning. 
Diarrhoeal disease. Active surveillance of children less 
than 5 years of age was conducted in the same villages as 
those in which the hand washing indicator was adminis- 
tered, including 6 villages from the high cost interven- 
tion, 6 from the low cost scheme, and 6 from the control. 
The survey took place during the seasonal peak of diar- 
rhoea incidence, but only after the intervention period. 
VHW were trained in diarrhoeal surveillance and moth- 
ers were issued with special calendars for recording diar- 
rhoea episodes of their children. For 3 months, VHW 
visited homes every week whenever nossible. Each 
month, project workers collected calendars from the 
VHW and monitored their work by visiting a random 
selection of homes. Diarrhoea was defined as 3 or more 
watery stools per day. About 75% of homes returned cal- 
endars each month that were validated by interviews 
with VHW. In addition, information on the reported in- 
cidence of diarrhoeal disease, for all ages, was collected 
from hospitals and clinics serving the study area. These 
data were checked with those compiled at the regional 
health centre. 
All quantitative data were entered on a micro-com- 
puter and analysed by the Statistical Package for Social 
Scientists (SPSSx). Unless otherwise stated, Student’s t- 
test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for com- 
paring group means. 
Results 
Socio-economic data for the intervention study vil- 
lages are summarized in Table 2. The mean duration of 
education was 4-6 years, and this did not vary consider- 
ably between villages. Although primary school atten- 
dance is now compulsory, few pupils (< 5%) from the 
project areas went on to secondary school or further edu-

cation. Without exception, the main occupation was ag- 
riculture, and in only 2 subdistricts, both located on ma- 
jor roads, did a significant proportion of families (but 
still fewer than 5%) cite non-agricultural work as their 
main occupation. Shallow wells, tube wells, rain jars and 
ponds were the main water sources. 
The main messages given during the intervention 
reached the vast majority of people in the intervention 
area, and less than 1% of those interviewed reported that 
they had not heard about the intervention; respondents 
were mainly female (98%) with a mean age of 39 years 
(range 10-76). Table 3 gives a summary of knowledge of 
the messages after intervention. Concerning hand wash- 
ing, villagers receiving the intervention 
were more 
knowledgeable than the controls, especially those from 
the high cost area (P<O.Ol). Knowledge of dish washing 
practice followed a similar pattern. A previous random 
survey of the intervention area before intervention had 
shown respondents to be less knowledgeable than those 
in control villages, suggesting that there may have been 
some contamination of the latter. 
The results from the hand washing indicator before 
(FSB) and after (FSA) intervention are shown in Table 
4. Although there was a significant reduction from FSB 
to FSA in the control villages, the reduction in the inter- 
vention villages was much greater. Comparing villages, 
FSB was similar in all groups but FSA was significantly 
less than the control value in both the low cost (PcO.01) 
and high cost (P<O.OOl) intervention areas; villages in 
the high cost scheme also gave lower values than those 
in the low cost area (P~0.05). The provision 
of plastic 
containers tended to show a marked improvement only 
in the homes in low cost intervention villages with the 
highest mean FSA values; overall, there was no signiti- 
cant difference between homes receiving containers and 
homes not receiving them. In order to test sustainability 
and reactivity, a selection of villages not previously sub- 
jected to the hand washing indicator was surveyed some 
5 months later. Four control villages produced a mean 
fingertip faecal streptococci index of 3.3, but interven- 
tion villages gave significantly lower values, 1.8 from 4 
low cost intervention 
villages (P<O.OOl) and 1.9 from 4 
villages in the high cost scheme (P~0.05). 
All homes were subjected to the dish washing indica- 
tor. Overall, there were significant improvements in 
both high cost (P<O.O5) and low cost intervention vil- 
lages (P<O*O5), with no apparent change in the control 
value. Six of 25 intervention villages showed a signifi- 
cant improvement at the 1% probability level and 4 
more at the 5% level, while 2 deteriorated; 3 of the 12 
control villages improved while 4 deteriorated (at the 5% 
probability level). 
Active surveillance of diarrhoeal disease in young 
children was conducted only after the intervention dur- 
ing the seasonal peak of summer diarrhoea in 6 control 
and 12 intervention villages. Diarrhoea was less com- 
mon in young children from the intervention villages, 
with 11 villages having lower incidence rates of diar- 
rhoea than 5 control villages (PcO.05; Mann-Whitney 
U test); overall this amounted to a 39% reduction. 
Further evidence to support these results was pro- 
vided by comparing the hand-washing indicator with 
diarrhoeal disease data. Among a total of 220 homes, 
those with sick children had higher mean FSA values 
than those recording no diarrhoea (P<O.O5). Despite 
there being only 50 valid cases, the same relationship 
held true for the control villages, with mean values of 2.4 
for homes without diarrhoea and 3.6 for those with diar- 
rhoea (P<O.O5). 
As might be expected, about 10 times more cases of di- 
arrhoea in young children were recorded through active 
surveillance than reported to clinics and hospitals. The 

370

study was not designed to show any significant differ- 
ence in reported diarrhoea, and there was no notable dif- 
ference as a result of the intervention or in comparison 
to the control. However, homes reporting no diarrhoea 
to health services in the year before intervention had 
mean FSB values of 3.8. comnared to 4.6 in homes re- 
porting one or more cases (fl<O+OOl). In the interven- 
tion villages, the same held true for FSA, with means of 
2.1 for 34 homes reporting diarrhoea after intervention 
and 1.2 from 107 homes with no diarrhoea P<O~Oll. 
Some of the biases in reporting were eliminated by in- 
cluding only homes reporting diarrhoea in the previous 
2 years. 
In the control villages, 3 separate surveys of dish 
washing behaviour were conducted at intervals of 4 
months. Comparing 2 extremes of this indicator, homes 
in which no dirty dish was seen in any of the 3 surveys 
reported a mean of 0.31 episodes of diarrhoea, while 
those in which dirty dishes were seen at all 3 surveys re- 
ported a mean of O-6 episodes, a 45% difference in the 
disease incidence (P<O.Ol). Intervention homes with no 
dirty dish after intervention reported 0.13 cases of diar- 
rhoea (after intervention) compared with 0.17 from 
homes with dirty dishes (PcO.05). The results from the 
questionnaire showed no notable relationship with any 
of the diarrhoea data. 
Discussion 
In questionnaires, hand washing before eating was in- 
variably identified as routine practice and more impor- 
tant than at other times such as after visiting the latrine 
or before cooking. However, observation before inter- 
vention revealed that, although hand washing was prac- 
tised at ceremonies or when entertaining special guests, 
it was rarely done before ordinary meals with family, 
relatives or friends. Hand washing was far more com- 
mon after eating when fingers were sticky, especially af- 
ter eating the staple diet of glutinous rice. This was con- 
firmed by information obtained from open interviews 
and group discussions, when hand washing was said to 
be more often done when hands were dirty rather than 
being motivated by another activity. These findings are 
in agreement with other studies on the limitations of us- 
ing questionnaires for measuring behaviour (STANTON et 
al., 1987; CURTIS et al, 1993). 
In comparison to continuous structured observation, 
the 2 indicators of behaviour readily provided quantifi- 
able data. The dish washing indicator was rather more 
straightforward, because there were tangible signs of this 
activity. Hand washing, on the other hand, is a difficult 
practice to measure by any means. Although the finger 
impression technique appeared to be useful as an indica- 
tor of general hand washing practice, it did not show 
specifically when hands were washed in relation to key 
activities. However, it may be a better overall indicator 
of the importance of different hygiene practices for dis- 
rupting faeco-oral disease transmission, as lingers play a 
major role in cross contamination at the oral end of this 
cycle. Even with good hand washing practice, the hand 
washing indicator would still reflect a contaminated lo- 
cal environment (e.g., from handling food, utensils, 
kitchen surfaces). Earlier studies have shown that house- 
holders living in modern homes with multiple water 
points, surfaces which are easy to clean, sinks for con- 
taining contamination, and refrigerators for food have 
considerably less hand contamination than those in the 
present study (PINFOLD, 1990a). Thus the finger impres- 
sion technique provides a simplified method for apprais- 
ing the need for modifying hygiene behaviour. 
Seasonal factors appeared to affect both indicators. 
Dish washing practice appeared to be largely affected by 
agricultural requirements, when rice planting and rice 
harvesting demand intensive labour by the whole family 
at certain times of the year. Climatic changes definitely 
affect fingertip contamination, with much higher levels 
apparent in the wet season than in the dry season (KAL- 
TENHALER et aZ., 1991; PINFOLD et aZ., 1991). This may 
partly explain the reduction in fingertip contamination 
found in the control villages and the high incidence of 
diarrhoea usually found, at the beginning of the rainy 
season. Despite the fact that surveys for each indicator 
were never administered on the same day, families with 
many dirty dishes after the intervention had higher lev- 
els of fingertip contamination than those with none 
(P<O.Ol). No similar relationship was found in the con- 
trol villages, implying that families conforming to the 
intervention advice were likely to adopt both practices 
rather than being selective. For larger programmes pro- 
moting 2 or more behaviours, it may be easier to select 
the simplest indicator when a similar relationship of 
adoption can be demonstrated. 
Health education nrogrammes often assume that, once 
their messages havebeen received by the intended-audi- 
ence, behaviour change will invariably follow. In this 
studv. although villages with better overall knowledge of 
the messagesappeargd to have less hand contamina;ion, 
this relationship did not hold true when analysing 
homes within villages. Furthermore, unlike the indica- 
tors of behaviour, knowledge of the messages within the 
intervention group showed no significant relationship 
with diarrhoeal disease. Interviews conducted in depth 
after intervention revealed that, although most people 
knew the messages well, this alone was not enough to 
change behaviour. The main reason for non-compliance 
was the difficulty experienced by adults, as opposed to 
children, in breaking habits. On the other hand, con- 
formers gave a higher priority to cleanliness and avoid- 
ing ‘germs’. The results also suggested that active in- 
volvement in the intervention and discussion amongst 
the community about the promoted behaviours were im- 
portant factors for sustained improvement in the behav- 
iours. Thus, actual practice was reinforced when these 
actions were supported by neighbours, friends, relatives, 
and schoolchildren. This process was more successful in 
villages with a stronger sense of community. 
In this intervention more attention was placed on 
what the ‘consumer’ perceived to be the immediate 
benefit from practising these particular hygiene behav- 
iours. Education interventions usually emphasize dis- 
ease prevention without seeking knowledge of how 
benefits are perceived by the target group. When people 
are sick there is a definite need to find a cure. However, 
people are not sick most of the time and, given the poor 
recall of past episodes of illness (STANTON et al., 1987), it 
is difficult to envisage disease prevention as a priority 
need. Moreover, an individual would not be able to no- 
tice changes in disease rates for his or her family, even 
with the advantage of hindsight. Therefore, to some ex- 
tent health education programmes are relying on the 
communities’ faith in their proficiency. However, com- 
munities are likely to lose that trust if exposed to contin- 
ual programmes that fail to take into account their envi- 
ronmental constraints, and use messages that are 
patronizing.
