Despite the tremendous achievement in reducing child mortality and morbidity in the last two decades, diar-
rhoea is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children in many developing countries, including
Ethiopia. Hand washing with soap promotion, water quality improvements and improvements in excreta dispos-
al signiﬁcantly reduces diarrhoeal diseases.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of hand washing with soap and water, sanitation and hy-
giene (WASH) educational Intervention on the incidence of under-ﬁve children diarrhoea. A community-based
cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 24 clusters (sub-Kebelles) in Jigjiga district, Somali region,
Eastern Ethiopia from February 1 to July 30, 2015. The trial compared incidence of diarrhoea among under-ﬁve
children whose primary caretakers receive hand washing with soap and water, sanitation, hygiene educational
messages with control households. Generalized estimating equation with a log link function Poisson distribution
family was used to compute adjusted incidence rate ratio and the corresponding 95% conﬁdence interval.
The results of this study show that the longitudinal adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of diarrhoeal diseases com-
paring interventional and control households was 0.65 (95% CI 0.57, 0.73) suggesting an overall diarrhoeal dis-
eases reduction of 35%. The results are similar to other trials of WASH educational interventions and hand
washing with soap.
In conclusion, hand washing with soap practice during critical times and WASH educational messages reduces
childhood diarrhoea in the rural pastoralist area.

1. Introduction
The deadline of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) has just
expired in 2015. The target for MDG 4 was to reduce the under-5 mor-
tality rate by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. This goal called for
two-thirds reduction in mortality in children younger than ﬁve years
between 1990 and 2015 (UN, 2000).
Since then, between 1990 and 2012, worldwide mortality in chil-
dren younger than 5 years has declined by 47%, from an estimated
rate of 90 deaths per 1000 live births to 48 deaths per 1000 live births.
This translates into 17,000 fewer children dying every day in 2012
than in 1990 (WHO, 2015). The 2014 report of the United Nations
Inter-Agency Group for mortality estimated that under-ﬁve mortality
decreased by 69% from 205 deaths per 1000 live births in 1990 to 64
in 2013, outpacing the MDG 4 target of a two-thirds reduction
(Alkema et al., 2014).
In Ethiopia between 2000 and 2016 under-ﬁve children mortality
have decreased remarkably by 60% from an estimated rate of 166 to
67 deaths per 1000 live births (CSA and ICF, 2016).
However, mortality rates for children under-ﬁve remains high. Re-
cent evidence showed that 6.3 million children died before age 5 years
in 2013. Among these, 51.8% (3.257 million) died of infectious causes.
If present trends continue, 4.4 million children younger than 5 years
will die in 2030. Furthermore, sub-Saharan Africa will have 33% of the
births and 60% of the deaths in 2030, compared with 25% and 50% in
2013 respectively (Liu et al., 2015). In Ethiopia, despite the sharp de-
crease in under-ﬁve mortality, regional variation exist within the coun-
try and Somali region has under-ﬁve mortality of 122 deaths per 1000
live births (CSA, 2012).
Infectious diseases reductions signiﬁcantly reduce childhood deaths.
Reductions in pneumonia, diarrhoea, and measles collectively were

responsible for half of the 3.6 million fewer deaths recorded in 2013 ver-
sus 2000 (Liu et al., 2015).
Childhood diarrhoea is the third leading cause of mortality in low in-
come countries including Ethiopia, causing an estimated 1.4 million
deaths in 2012 (WHO, 2015; Forouzanfar et al., 2015). Young children
are especially vulnerable, with diarrhoea accounting more than one
quarter of all deaths in children aged under-ﬁve years in Africa and
South East Asia (Murray et al., 2013; Lanata et al., 2013; Walker et al.,
2013; Boschi-Pinto et al., 2008).
Diarrhoeal disease risk reductions of 48%, 17% and 36% is associated
respectively with hand washing promotion, water quality improve-
ments and improvements in excreta disposal (Cairncross et al., 2010).
WASH interventions averted 13% of childhood deaths in Ethiopia in
2011 (Doherty et al., 2016).
Water from improved source isn't always safe (WHO, 2012) and
may be contaminated with pathogens during transportation and stor-
age (WHO, 2007). Estimates of the health impact of WASH interven-
tions on under-ﬁve children are derived from interventions that
promote or improve domestic services and practices in the environment
(Cairncross et al., 2010).
Moreover, hand washing with soap can reduce micro-organism level
close to zero and can interrupt the transmission of faecal-oral microbes
in the domestic environment (Kampf and Kramer, 2004; Sprunt et al.,
1973) mainly through the mechanics of rubbing and rinsing (Sprunt
et al., 1973; Lowbury et al., 1964).
The effect of hand washing with soap practices and WASH educa-
tional interventions on childhood diarrhoea in the rural settings of the
Sub-Saharan Africa remains unexplored, although it was done in Asia
three decades ago (Stanton and Clemens, 1987). Interventional studies
have covered the transfer of knowledge about proper hygiene but
from school settings (Bowen et al., 2007; Blanton et al., 2010;
Dreibelbis et al., 2014).
We evaluated the effect of hand washing with soap practice and
WASH educational intervention on childhood diarrhoeal diseases inci-
dence in the rural pastoralist community settings of Somali region, East-
ern Ethiopia.
2. Methods
2.1. Ethics statement
The study protocols have been reviewed and approved by the Jigjiga
University ethical review committee. Study consent was obtained from
district administration, district health ofﬁce and community leaders.
Control clusters in the sub-Kebelle have received free books and pencils
to support their children's education during the study period and after
completion of the study, they were given the same health education ses-
sions used in this study. Written consent was taken from the primary
caretakers of the children.
2.2. Study setting
The current study was conducted in the rural areas of Jigjiga district
of Ethiopian-Somali Regional State (ESRS) in the Eastern Ethiopia from
February 1 to July 30, 2015. The ESRS is one of the nine regional states
that constitute the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. Pastoralism
is a way of life whereby the livelihood of the people depends on raising
livestock and living on its milk and meat (Montavon et al., 2013). Nearly
90% of the population in ESRS resides in rural areas, leading either a pas-
toralist or agro-pastoralist lifestyle. Jigjiga district is one of the 68 dis-
tricts of the region, part of Fafan zone, with a total population of
277,560 according to 2007 census conducted by the central statistical
agency of Ethiopia of whom 149,292 are men and 128,268 women. A
total of 34 Kebele is found in the district of which 4 are urban and 30
are rural Kebele in the Woreda (Fig. 1). Finally Jigjiga district was
selected for the study because of acute watery diarrhoea outbreaks as
reported by the Regional Health Bureau.
2.3. Sample size determination
The sample was calculated by using methods published by
Hayes and Bennett (1999). A recent study conducted in Eastern Ethiopia
indicated disease rates for incidence of child diarrhoea among
home based chlorine treatment intervention group of 4.5 episodes/
100 person week observations (Mengistie et al., 2013). Using this
incidence, along with 80% power and 95% conﬁdence interval, we ran-
domly selected a ﬁnal sample of 24 clusters (12 for the intervention
group and 12 for the control group) with 50 children of under-ﬁve in
each cluster.
2.4. Study design and eligibility criteria
A community-based cluster randomized controlled trial was
employed. The study groups were divided into two: clusters that re-
ceived intervention and control clusters. Only rural communities of
the district were selected for the study. A household was considered el-
igible for the study if the following criteria are met: a) at least one child
aged 1–59 months living in the home and b) not a model health exten-
sion household. Households that successfully implement all compo-
nents of the 16 packages of the Health Extension Program (HEP)
are ofﬁcially certiﬁed as a Model Health Extension Household
(Teklehaimanot et al., 2007). This trial excludes all model Health Exten-
sion households to avoid biases due to a competing intervention.
2.5. Randomization and masking
Kebelle is the smallest administrative unit in Ethiopia consisting of at
least 500 households, or the equivalent of 3500 to 4000 persons (FMOH,
2007). The Kebelle is further divided into sub-Kebelles (neighbourhood
villages). A Final count of 14 Kebelle was eligible for the study. These el-
igible Kebelles for the study located north and south of Jigjiga City i.e., 5
North (22 sub-Kebelles) and 9 South (34 sub-Kebelles). Eligible
Kebelles in the north and south were assigned randomly to intervention
and control groups respectively by using lottery method in the presence
of community leaders, Kebele heads and representative from the district
health ofﬁce and Regional Health Bureau to avoid study contamination
by geographically separating the region of the intervention from
the control region. Twenty-four Sub-Kebelles were then randomly se-
lected from the 56 total sub-Kebelles by using simple randomization
(computer generated numbers). From 22 sub-Kebelles, 12 were
selected randomly and assigned to the Intervention group. From 34
sub-Kebelles, 12 were selected randomly and assigned to the control
group (Fig. 2).
Neither the community (both control and intervention group) nor
the ﬁeld workers knew the intervention purpose. The follow up study
started on February 1, 2015 and ended July 30, 2015.
2.6. Intervention
Twelve sessions of health education on key WASH messages and
demonstration of hand washing with soap were given to all of the inter-
vention clusters by clinical nurse professionals (ﬁeld workers) who
have taken training for 10 days. Primary care takers of the children in
the households were instructed to keep their water storage container
clean and covered, to have a latrine and utilize properly, and to wash
their hands and children's hands ideally with soap after defecation, be-
fore meal preparation and eating.
The ﬁeld workers arranged cluster (Sub-Kebelle) meetings for each
cluster to illustrate the pamphlets, show health problems resulting
from hand and water contamination and showed speciﬁc instruction
on how to use the intervention assigned to the cluster. Intervention

happened every 2 weeks in a period of 6 months follow up. Each inter-
vention took up to 3-hour time from 4:00 pm to 7:00 pm local time
since most village residents were available in late afternoon.
All households in the intervention clusters received a package of
health education messages and soap (white bars). The ﬁeld workers
demonstrated by face to face approach how to wet their hands, lather
them completely with soap, and rub together for 1 min. The other key
messages were provided by using loudspeaker (Megaphone) at one
time in each visit at the respective cluster location.
Primary care takers of the control group continued their way of hand
washing practices, disposal of water storage behaviour and latrine san-
itation. After the completion of the study they were given the same ed-
ucational intervention used in this study. Table 1 illustrates key
messages and interventions used in this study.
2.7. Data collection and outcome assessment
The primary outcome was longitudinal incidence of diarrhoea. In
this study diarrhoea is deﬁned as the passage of three or more liquid
or semi-liquid stools in a 24-hour period or the passage of at least one
liquid or semi-liquid stool with blood or mucus (Baqui et al., 1991).
This deﬁnition of diarrhoea was being instructed to the primary care
takers by the data collectors. Primary care takers were also instructed
to follow the child and report diarrhoea in the previous two weeks.
Twenty-four data collectors (ﬁeld workers) visited intervention and
control households in every 2 weeks period (12 visits). At each visit, oc-
currence of diarrhoea (episodes of diarrhoea) over the previous two
weeks was recorded by the data collectors for all under-ﬁve children
based on the primary care taker report.

The secondary outcome was bacteriological quality of drinking
water at household level. Water samples (100 ml) were collected
from all households' drinking water storage container by asking the pri-
mary care takers to provide water from the containers for the re-
searchers.
The guideline of
WHO for drinking water quality
assessment was used as a method of water sample collection at each
household (WHO, 2004). The collected water samples from each source
was labelled and kept in icebox during transportation and analysed in
the laboratory. All collected samples were analysed for the presence of
faecal coliform.
A baseline survey was conducted on primary care takers, children,
environmental characteristics and pre-intervention diarrhoea preva-
lence rates by using questionnaire.
2.8. Data analysis
The data was cross checked by the ﬁeld supervisors on a visit basis.
Prior to data entry, base line and follow up visit data forms were
checked for completeness and consistence. Data was double entered
on to EPI data Version 3.5.3 and statistical analysis was performed by
using SPSS version 20. Intention-to-treat analysis was used to compare
the incidence of diarrhoea among under-ﬁve children between inter-
vention and control arms.
The baseline data was analysed and compared among the interven-
tion and control group. The rate of diarrhoea (per 100 person-weeks) in
children under-ﬁve years of age was measured for the intervention and
control communities. Generalized estimating equation (Zeger and
Liang, 1986) with log link Poisson distribution family was used to com-
pute adjusted incidence rate ratio and the corresponding 95% conﬁ-
dence interval of the dependent variable (longitudinal incidence of
diarrhoea) and co-variates. For the water quality, water samples were
analysed for the presence of faecal coliforms and compared among the
intervention and control communities.
3. Results
3.1. Baseline characteristics
At baseline assessment 612 households were interviewed in January
15–25, 2015. The household, primary care takers, children and environ-
mental characteristics were generally similar across intervention and
control households and well balanced. The number of households and
children per cluster were 25 and 50 respectively. The mean age of the
mothers/caretakers was 28.5 for the intervention group and 29.7 for
the control group and for the children 21.3 and 21.5 months in the inter-
vention and control respectively. Pre-intervention two week diarrhoea
prevalence was 26.5% for the control households and 23.2% for the inter-
vention households (Table 2)).
3.2. Longitudinal incidence of diarrhoea
The incidence of diarrhoea was signiﬁcantly lower among under-
ﬁve children from the intervention households. From the control arm
905 occurrences (episodes) of diarrhoea (6.3 episodes per 100 person-
weeks observation) were reported. Intervention households reported
594 episodes (4.1 episodes per 100 person-weeks observation)
(Table 3).

Sharp decrease of diarrhoea episodes per week among intervention
households was observed during the course of this study. Fig. 3 shows
the number of diarrhoea occurrence and the visit week.
In both interventional and control households, in the follow up dura-
tion, the longitudinal episodes of diarrhoea was higher in children b-
12 months. The reduction of diarrhoea episodes for all age group in
the follow up duration between the control and intervention house-
holds is shown in Fig. 4.
3.3. Household drinking water quality
There is a signiﬁcant difference between the intervention and con-
trol households in the base-line and end-line water contamination. At
base-line nearly 31% of the water was contaminated from the interven-
tion households but in the end line assessment only 11% were contam-
inated from the intervention households (Table 4).
3.4. Multivariable analysis of intervention effect
Generalized estimating equation using log link function was used to
control confounding factors that might have contributed to the inci-
dence of diarrhoeal diseases. Socio-demographic characteristics, child,
maternal factors and WASH related factors were checked if there is an
association with the incidence of diarrhoea. The result shows that only
the intervention contributes to the reduction of diarrhoea in the study
area. See Table 5.
4. Discussion
The study assessed effect of hand washing with soap and WASH ed-
ucational interventions on the incidence of childhood diarrhoea in the
rural settings of Somali region. The study shown 35% reduction (RR =
0.65; 95% CI 0.57,0.73) in diarrhoeal diseases for households who

practiced hand washing with soap and the WASH key messages com-
pared to control households that were given no intervention. The result
of the study is supporting one another. When exposure of continuous
health education session was given consistently in six months period,
longitudinal incidence of under-ﬁve children diarrhoea has decreased
by 35%.
The importance of WASH educational interventions is stressed by re-
ports that show that improvements in water supply in terms of quantity
and quality and physical facilities for excreta disposal without adequate
behavioural change among the target community alone would not
change the prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases (Brown et al., 2013).
Although our study didn't compare effect of each intervention on the
overall reduction, we believe that the WASH educational messages also
led to behavioural changes among the target group which together re-
duced diarrhoeal diseases. Our result suggests the assumption that it
was those combinations of hand washing with soap and key health ed-
ucation on WASH factors that reduced the incidence of diarrhoea on a
weekly base as ﬁeld workers continue visiting and instructing interven-
tion households.
The result was consistent with other similar studies interventional
study done on the subject WASH interventions (Blanton et al., 2010;
Bowen et al., 2007; Luby et al., 2005; Luby et al., 2006; Freeman et al.,
2012; Han and Hlaing, 1989; Aiello et al., 2008).
Limitation of this study includes randomization at the Sub-Kebelle
level which resulted in a small number of clusters but the result can
still be compared to other studies of WASH education and hand washing
interventions.
