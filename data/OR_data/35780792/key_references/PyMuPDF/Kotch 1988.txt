The
growing
use
of
child
day-care
centers
(CDCCs)
has
pro-
duced
a
significant
rise
in
morbidity
due
to
infectious
diseases
which
carry
such
consequences
as
discomfort,
disability,
and
pa-
rental
anxiety.’2
Haskins
conservatively
estimated
the
cost
of
day-
care
illnesses
among
children
to
be
$1 .8
billion.3
To
this
must
be
added
the
cost
of
parents’
and
care
givers’
excess
illness
attribut-
able
to
CDCCs.
No
published
study
describes
a
successful
intervention
to
re-
duce
the
risk
of
upper
respiratory
disease
in
CDCCs.
Although
many
research
groups
have
advocated
hand
washing
and
diaper-
ing
hygiene
as
a means
of
reducing
the
spread
of
enteric
disease
in
CDCCs,4”
there
are
only
two
controlled
studies
in
the
literature.
In
their
pioneering
work,
Black
et
al
showed
the
incidence
of
diarrhea
in
CDCCs
following
a rigorously
monitored
hand-wash-
ing
program
to
be
nearly
twice
that
in
intervention
centers.’2
Bartlett
et
al
monitored
the
impact
of
hand
washing
in
randomly
assigned
CDCCs
and
found
no
intervention
effect.
However,
rates
of
diarrhea
were
significantly
lower
among
children
in
the
ac-
tively
monitored
centers
regardless
of
intervention
status.’3
These
studies
share
several
limitations:
the
sources
of
incidence
data
were
not
blinded
to
center
intervention
status,
the
analyses
did
not
statistically
control
for
potential
confounders,
and
non-
independence
of
multiple
diarrhea
episodes
in
the
same
child
were
not
accounted
for.
The
purposes
of
our
study
were
to
de-
velop
a
feasible,
multicomponent
hygienic
intervention
and
to
carefully
measure
its
impact
while
controlling
for
sources
of
bias.

METHODS
Design
We
conducted
a randomized
trial
of
an
hygienic
intervention
in
24
CDCCs
in
Cumberland
County,
North
Carolina.
Centers
met
the
following
criteria:
enrollment
less
than
30
children,
at
least
five
children
attending
in
diapers,
and
projected
to
operate
for
at
least
2 years.
Centers
of
similar
enrollment
were
paired,
and
one
of
the
pair
was
randomly
assigned
to
the
intervention
group.
Study
Population
We
distributed
over
800
enrollment
booklets
to
parents
that
included
a
seif-administered
eligibility
form;
a
child
enrollment
form
about
the
child,
his
or
her
family,
the
home
environment
and
child-care
history;
and
a
consent
form.
Parents
who
were
willing
to
participate
in
a telephone
survey
completed
the
questionnaire,
signed
the
informed
consent
form,
and
returned
these
to
the
director
of
their
CDCC.
All
389
children
who
met
the
eligibility
criteria
(under
36
months
of
age,
in
day
care
at
least
20
hours
per
week,
absence
of
chronic
illness
or
medication
that
would
predis-
pose
to
infections,
youngest
of
potentially
eligible
children
in
the
same
family,
consenting
English-speaking
parents
with
access
to
a
telephone,
and
intending
to
remain
in
day
care
throughout
the
study)
were
enrolled.

Intervention
The
intervention,
a
curriculum
for
care
givers,
was
piloted
at
the
Frank
Porter
Graham
Child
Development
Center,
which
did
not
participate
in
the
subsequent
study.
Workers
from
control
centers
were
trained
at
the
conclusion
of
the
clinical
trial.
Training
for
care
givers
in
intervention
centers
began
October
1,
1988.
Sessions
lasted
3 hours
and
required
participants
to
demon-
strate
skills
in
hand
washing
and
diapering.
Pre-
and
post-test
questionnaires
were
administered
to
measure
their
improvement
in
knowledge.
Three
credit
hours
were
granted
to
each
care
giver
who
attended.
The
specific
strategies
that
were
emphasized
were
hand
washing
of
children
and
staff;
disinfection
of
toilet
and
diapering
areas;
physical
separation
of
diapering
areas
from
food
preparation
and
serving
areas;
hygienic
diaper
disposal;
availabil-
ity
of
soap,
running
water,
and
disposable
towels
(a
waterless,
disinfectant
scrub

if
the
alternative
were
not
washing
at
all);
daily
washing
and

and
bathroom
floors;
daily
laundering
of
blankets,
sheets,
dress-up
clothes,
etc;
and
hygienic
preparation,
serving,
and
clean-up
of
food.
Care
givers
received
on-site
follow-up
training
a week
later
and
subsequently
at
5-week
intervals.
This
reinforcement
of
the
didac-
tic
training
included
adaptations,
demonstrations,
and
discussions
of
hygienic
techniques;
responses
to
care-giver’s
questions;
and
review
of
handouts
for
posting
in
the
CDCC.
We
met
with
directors
at
the
intervention
centers
monthly
to
encourage
their
leadership
and
support.
A
separate
training
pro-
gram
was
provided
for
food
handlers.
Additional
training
ses-
sions
were
scheduled
periodically
for
new
employees.
Illness
Measures
and
Definitions
A
pilot
study
among
101
CDCC
families
undertaken
between
May
23,
1988,
and
July
29,
1988,
tested
recruitment
procedures
and
the
telephone
survey.
The
survey
was
conducted
from
October
19,
1988,
to
May
23,
1989,
by
Survey
Research
Associates,
Inc.
of
Durham,
NC,
using
computer-assisted
telephone
interview
meth-
odology.
All
families
were
called
biweekly
to
elicit
information
including
diarrheal
and
respiratory
symptoms.
Each
week’s
data
were
transferred
to
study
data
sets
and
reviewed
for
consistency
and
errors.
Diarrhea
was
defined
as
a
report
by
a
parent
of
an
unusually
loose
or
watery
stool.
Respiratory
symptoms
included
coughing,
runny
nose,
wheezing
or
rattling
in
the
chest,
sore
throat,
or
earache.
A
new
illness
episode
was
defined
as
onset
of
symptoms
following
at
least
7
consecutive
symptom-free
days.
A
severe
diarrhea
episode
was
defined
as
at
least
five
loose
stools
during
24
hours
along
with
vomiting,
fever,
or
both.
For
each
classroom,
six
incidence
rates
(number
of
new
episodes
per
fortnight
at
risk)
were
computed:
pure
diarrhea
(episodes
characterized
by
diar-
rheal
symptoms
without
any
respiratory
symptoms);
pure
diar-
rhea,
severe
(such
episodes
with
severe
diarrheal
symptoms
only);
all
diarrhea
(all
episodes
with
diarrheal
symptoms,
with
or
with-
out
respiratory
symptoms);
all
diarrhea,
severe
(all
such
episodes
with
severe
diarrheal
symptoms);
all
respiratory
(all
episodes
with
any
respiratory
symptoms,
with
or
without
diarrheal
symptoms);
and
all
respiratory,
severe
(all
such
respiratory
episodes
with
fever).

Finally,
the
study
used
the
Infant/Toddler
Environment

Scales,
an
instrument
consisting
of
35
items,
each
scored
on
a seven-point
scale
from
I

inadequate
to
7
=
excellent,
designed
to
give
a
global
assessment
of
center
quality.4
Analysis
Incidence
rates
were
calculated
at
the
classroom
level.
Children
who
changed
classrooms
contributed
episodes
and
time
at
risk
to
each
classroom.
The
effect
of
the
intervention
was
estimated
by
comparing
the
mean
incidence
rate
of
intervention
classrooms
with
that
of
nonintervention
classrooms,
adjusting
for
mean
class-
room
age
and
for
potential
confounders
in
linear
regression
mod-
els
in
which
controlling
variables
were
centered
at
their
means.
Rate
differences,
expressed
as
mean
excess
episodes
per
child-
year,
and
ratios
were
estimated.
In
order
to
select
potential
confounders,
variables
collected
with
the
data
collection
instruments
were
examined
for
associa-
tions
with
intervention
status
and
with
incidence
rates.
(The
com-
plete
list
of
variables
is available
upon
request.)
Because
variables
were
redundant
and
highly
correlated,
factor
analyses
were
per-
formed.’5
Through
a
series
of
step-wise
regressions,
first
within
each
instrument
and
then
combining
variables
selected
from
all
instruments,
we
identified
a set
of
factors
and
individual
variables
that
were
related
to
classroom
incidence
rates
(P
<
.15).
All
variables
in
the
confounder
sets
and
a
priori
effect
modifiers,
such
as
season
and
age
of
center,
were
examined
as
interaction
terms
conditional
on
age
and
the
appropriate
set
of
potential
confounders.
RESULTS
The
families
of
18
children
initially
enrolled
were
dropped
because
they
could
not
be
contacted
or
because
the
child
was
not
in
day
care
for
two
consecutive
interviews.
Among
the
remaining
371
families,
4046
biweekly
telephone
interviews
were
completed.
There
were
291
children
under
24
months
and
80
over
24
months
at
the
start
of
the
interviewing.
One
center
withdrew
from
the
study
before
its
last
data
collection
visit.
Therefore,
some
obser-
vational
data
were
available
only
for
23
centers.
There
were
31
intervention
and
36
control
classrooms
that
participated.
Child,
family,
and
CDCC
characteristics
according
to
interven-
tion
status
are
shown
in
Table
1.
Children
were
frequently
non-
white,
of
moderate
socioeconomic
status
(SES),
and
residing
in
relatively
uncrowded
homes.
The
centers
were
large,
most
often
nonprofit,
had
many
children
per
classroom,
and
child-to-staff
ratios
of
7:1
.
Access
to
sinks
was
less
than
optimal
and
staff
usually
both
diapered
children
and
prepared
food.
Overall
qual-
ity,
based
on
the
ITERS,
was
average
for
North
Carolina.’4

acteristics
including
hygienic
behavior.
However,
several
characteristics
that
might
be
related
to
greater
infection
rates
were
more
frequent
in
intervention
centers:
nonwhite
children,
shorter
time
since
enrollment,
sharing
a bedroom
at
home,
single-parent
household,
residing
in
a
multifamily
dwelling,
open
classroom,
and
inadequate
access
to
sinks.
Respiratory
episodes
were
most
frequent,
followed
by
all
diar-
rhea
(Table
2).
Severe
diarrhea
and
pure
diarrhea
were
infrequent.
Intervention
classrooms
with
a
mean
age
under
24
months
had
lower
diarrhea
rates
than
such
control
classrooms,
but
these
crude
differences
were
not
significant.

improved
in
inter-

centers
both
after
diapering
(0.75
vs

and
after
contact
with

etc
of
children
(0.66
vs

Adjusted
for
age
only,
there
were
no
significant
differences
between
intervention
and
nonintervention
classrooms,
although
in
every
case
the
risk
of
illness
was
greater
in
the
nonintervention
classrooms
(Table
3).
When
the
set
of
extraneous
variables
asso-
ciated
with
each
ifiness
outcome
were
controlled,
nonintervention
classrooms
experienced
significantly
more
episodes
of
all
diar-
rhea,
severe
(0.5,
95%
CI
0.4,
1.04)
than
intervention
classrooms.
Other
illness
outcomes
differed
little
by
intervention
status.
The
intervention
effect
on
all
diarrhea,
severe
was
modified
by
three
characteristics:
length
of
the
CDCC’s
operation,
the
mean
age
of
children
in
classrooms,
and
the
care-giver
hand-washing
factor.
For
centers
in
operation
less
than
6.5
years,
children
in
intervention
classrooms
experienced
less
all
diarrhea,
severe
than
did
those
attending
control
dassrooms
(Table
3).
This
difference
was
not
observed
in
centers
operating
more
than
6.5
years.

The

effective
in

despite
the
fact
that,
after

might

SUPPLEMENT
handling
of
respiratory
secretions
by
staff
were
addressed
in
the
training,
the
intervention
may
have
had
less
impact
on
child-to-child
spread
and
on
aerosol
spread
than
on
worker-to-
child
transmission.
This
study
introduced
design
and
analytic
innovations
that
we
believe
improve
upon
previous
trials.’2”3
Specifically,
parental
illness
reports
were
blind
to
the
intervention
status
of
their
chil-
dren’s
CDCCs,
potential
confounders
were
controlled
for,
and
effect
modifiers
were
examined.
Finally,
nonindependence
of
out-
come
events
was
minimized
by
using
the
classroom
as
the
unit
of
observation.
This
study
was
conducted
in
larger
centers
caring
for
younger
children,
however,
and
may
not
be
generalizable
to
smaller
centers
or
family
day-care
homes.
Although
hygienic
behaviors
of
care
givers
improved
after
intervention,
such
changes
were
not
shown
to
lead
to
reduction
for
most
illness
rates.
Therefore,
we
hypothesized
that
the
inter-
vention
was
limited
by
physical
barriers,
such
as
the
distance
between
diapering
areas
and
a
sink,
and
access
to
a
sink
in
the
room.
During
the
course
of the
intervention,
we
encouraged
center
directors
to
modify
these
barriers.
Measures
of
physical
facilities
at
the
end
of
the
intervention
and
the
proportion
of
care
givers
completing
sanitation
and
hygiene
training
tended
to
favor
younger
centers,
but
none
of
these
differences
were
significant.
However,
the
rate
of
compliance
with
the
recommended
modifi-
cations
was
significantly
better
in
younger
centers
(P
=
.027),
and
younger
centers
were
more
likely
to
have
written
guidelines
for
handling
children
with
diarrhea
(Fisher’s
Exact
Test,
P
<
.05).
These
observations
are
reminiscent
of
Sacks
et
al’s’6
observation
that
newly
installed
day-care
center
directors
were
more
likely
to
remove
safety
hazards
from
playgrounds
than
were
directors
who
had
been
in
their
jobs
longer.
In
conclusion,
the
intervention
resulted
in
moderate
improve-
ment
in
the
mean
incidence
of
all
diarrhea,
severe,
especially
among
younger
children
and
in newer
centers.
However,
physical
barriers
and
resistance
of
more
experienced
staff
to
behavior
change
may
restrict
the
impact
of
training
and
reinforcement
of
hygenic
behavior
on
illness
rates
in
CDCCs
with
limited
resources.
To
reduce
the
incidence
of
infectious
disease
in
CDCCs,
it
may
be
necessary
to
address
physical
barriers
and
financial
constraints
along
with
training
the
care
givers.

The
introduction
and
widespread
use
of
vaccines
has
had
a
remarkable
impact
on
childhood
diseases
in
the
US
(Table
1).
There
are
now
nine
diseases
against
which
all
children
should
be
routinely
vaccinated
unless
there
are
contraindications:
diphthe-
ria,
Haemophilus
influenzae
type
b
(Hib),
hepatitis
B,
measles,
mumps,
pertussis,
poliomyelitis,
rubella,
and
tetanus.
Recom-
mended
policies
for
the
use
of
these
vaccines
have
undergone
changes
during
the
past
few
years.
The
purposes
of
this
review
are
to provide
an
updated
summary
of the
major
new
or
anticipated
developments
in
