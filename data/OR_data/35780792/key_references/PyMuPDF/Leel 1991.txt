Abstract. This study has demonstrated that additional training of service providers [village health 
volunteers (VHVs), village health communicators (VHCs)] in combination with the mobilization of vil­
lage leaders and influentials to promote selective preventive health behavior, can have a marked impact 
upon the effectice practive of these behaviors and diarrheal incidence. Further, this impact can be achieved 
through the existing staff structure, ie, VHVIVHCs of the national health program. For example, increased 
contact between these service providers and mothers of children under 5 years through home visits and 
attendance at meetings held by the service providers, contributed positively to the practice of selected 
preventive behaviors. If the national program provided similar training inputs on the promotion of selected 
preventive behaviors and increased service provider contacts, the program's impact upon diarrheal disease 
would be enhanced. 
INTRODUCTION 
Diarrheal diseases are major community 
health problems in Thailand. The Ministry of 
Public Health reported in 1986 that diarrhea was 
the leading cause of morbidity for all ages and the 
second most important cause ofdeath among chil­
dren under 5 years of age. Diarrheal morbidity 
more than doubled in this group between 1980 
and 1983, declined slightly during 1984 and 1985 
but increased in 1986 to the highest level in this 
decade (Family Health Division, 1988). 
In 1980 the Ministry of Public Health intro­
duced a National Control of Diarrheal Diseases 
Program that featured as one of its major activities 
the promotion of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) 
and distribution of oral rehydration salts (ORS). 
Implementation of the program at the field level is 
carried out by village health communicators 
(VHCs) and village health volunteers (VHVs). 
VHCs are selected by local village councils in 
cooperation with public health officials. Follow­
ing training and a work period of three or four 
months in the village (each VHC is responsibie for 
about 10 households), public health officials select 
the most effective VHC to become the VHV for 
the village. The VHV is primarily responsible for 
health service delivery, eg, distribution of ORS 
and contraceptives and administration of immu­
nization. The VHCs are responsible for promot­
ing health care and referring villagers for the 
health services. 
Despite these efforts a recent experimental 
study of an ORS intervention program in southern 
Thailand found that less than one-third of the 
children under 5 years who had an episode of 
diarrhea were treated with ORS and that the inci­
dence rate for diarrhea among these children was 
almost 50% (Jintaganont and Butaras, 1987). The 
intervention program raised the proportions of 
children with diarrhea being treated with ORS 
from 31% to 82% in experimental areas. However, 
the incidence of diarrhea among children under 5 
years showed little change. The present study 
evaluates an intervention intended to reduce the 
incidence of diarrhea in these areas.

EDUCATION IN DIARRHEAL DISEASE 
tion was identical to the one used so successfully in 
an earlier experimental study on ORS in Southern 
Thailand (Jintaganont et ai, 1988). A two day 
training program was conducted for VHVs, 
VHCs, local regligious leaders (ie Imams in Muslim 
villages only) and village heads within tambons 
(clusters of villages) selected to receive the public 
health education program. The content of the 
training included: the objectives of the interven­
tion program; an introduction to general health 
care and hygiene; symptoms and causes of diar­
rhea; common local misperceptions about diar­
rhea; the role of service providers in promoting 
preventive health behavior, including the conduct 
of home visits; preventive health behavior regard­
ing water, food, and the use and care of latrines; 
and role playing with local villagers on how to 
motivate them to adopt preventive health behav­
iors in the context of a home visit. 
After the training program was completed, 
meetings were held in each of the villages with the 
tambon council, provincial, district and local 
health officers, Imams, VHVs, VHCs, and about 
30-40 residents from the villages. The meetings 
were conducted by local health officers trained by 
project staff, and introduced the new content of 
the public health education campaign conducted 
by the service providers. 
The health education intervention was imple­
mented after the meetings and continued for ap­
proximately 6 months. During the intervention 
period, meetings were held monthly in all villages 
receiving the intervention with the same health 
officers and service providers, and tam bon councils 
who participated in the introductory meeting. 
Generally 30-40 women from each village were re­
cruited by the VHV /VHCs to attend these meet­
ings, the purpose of which was to promote appro­
priate preventive health behaviors regarding 
diarrhea. 
Research design 
This study utilizes a quasi-experimental re­
search design characterized by five sets of inter­
related activities : focus groups to develop inter­
view schedules; an intervention of six months in 
experimental areas; and baseline surveys, follow-up 
surveys and monitoring of diarrheal episodes 
among children under 5 years in experimental and 
control areas. 
The study was conducted in two districts of 
Pattani Province, Kok Pho and Nong Chik. Two 
Muslim tambons were randomly selected from 
Nong Chik District and three Buddhist tambons 
randomly selected from Kok Pho District. One 
tambon from Nong Chik district and two tambons 
from Kok Pho District were randomly assigned as 
experimental areas and the other two tambons 
randomly assigned as control areas. All villages 
from the Muslim and Buddhist tambons were 
included in the study. 
July-September and October-December were 
selected as the periods to assess changes in diar­
rheal incidence between the experimental and 
control areas. The period for the health program 
intervention was the six months beginning July 1 
and ending December 31. The incidence of diar­
rhea was monitored concurrently during this 
period. Because of cost and time constraints it was 
not possible to monitor diarrhea before and after 
the intervention which would have provided pre 
and post program diarrheal incidence that could 
be compared between the experimental and con­
trol areas. Therefore, we focused on the changes 
in diarrheal incidence during the program period. 
The first three months represent the period when 
the program was beginning and had minimal 
impact on diarrheal incidence, while the remain­
ing three months represent the period where maxi­
mum impact should have occurred. It should be 
noted that dividing the period for analysis in this 
manner increases the risk of underestimating pro­
gram impact if it succeeded in reducing incidence 
during the first three months. That is, incidence 
may already have decreased which would be re­
flected in a reduced rate of change in the experi­
mental area between the two periods. 
Data collection 
A baseline survey of mothers of children under 
5 years of age was conducted during May-June 
1988. Information was collected on socioeconomic 
factors; maternal beliefs and attitudes, and pre­
ventive and curative behaviors related to diar­
rhea; availability and accessibility of health ser­
vices; and contacts with health care providers. 
The follow-up survey was conducted in experi­
mental and control areas during January-February 
1989. Comparable data to the baseline data were 
collected as wen as information on preventive

behavior promoted by health care providers. 
These data were matched with the baseline data to 
obtain the panel of respondents (N = 743) who 
were in the experimental and control areas for the 
entire period of the study. 
Monitoring of diarrhea was conducted by vil­
lage teachers among children under 5 years (N = 
904) every two weeks for six months, beginning 
one month after initiation of the intervention and 
ending with the initiation of the follow-up survey. 
The monitors received intensive training for two 
weeks which focused upon the identification, 
recording and checking of diarrheal events and 
extensive practice with the diarrhea monitoring 
form in the village setting. 
Problems that could contribute to undermin­
ing the reliability of the diarrheal data were re­
duced through the training, and the rather low 
number of households assigned to each staff for 
monitoring. That is, each monitor was responsible 
for only 10-13 households. Further, every two 
weeks monitors were visited by a supervisor who 
prepared a summary of the data collected, and 
verified through reinterview the diarrheal cases re­
ported and their duration; and randomly checked 
households for any additional cases which were 
unreported. 
A diarrheal episode was defined as three or 
more loose stools during a 24 hour period; a maxi­
mum number of three days without symptoms 
was defined as the period necessary to separate 
different episodes. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
As seen in Table I diarrheal incidence among 
children under 5 years in experimental areas de­
clined by about two thirds between JUly-Septem­
ber and October-December compared to slightly 
over one third among children in the control area. 
The decline in the experimental area among chil­
dren 1-24 months and 25-60 months was about 40 
points and 28 points greater, respectively, than the 
decline in the control area. 
The pattern of greater decline in diarrheal inci­
dence in the experimental area than in the control 
area persists among selected age groups of children 
after controlling for religious affiliation and ma­
ternal education. The largest differences in the 
decline occur among Buddhist children aged 25-60 
months, and among children aged 1-24 months 
whose mothers have a class 4 education or less 
(Table 1). 
The greater declines in diarrheal incidence 
among children in the experimental area than in 
the control area, irrespective of their mothers re­
ligious affiliation and education, clearly demon­
strate the impact of the intervention program 
upon diarrheal disease. However, further investi­
gation is necessary to identify the maternal preven­
tive behavior through which the program contri­
buted to the decline in diarrhea in the experimental 
area. First, the preventive behavior related to 
diarrheal disease and increased by the interven­
tion program were identified. The second part of 
the investigation determined if this preventive 
behavior was associated with the decline of diar­
rheal incidence in the experimental area. 
Table 2 presents the mean number of diarrheal 
episodes occurring in children in relation to 
mothers' preventive health behavior during the 
period July-December of 1988. Practice during the 
period was difined as "regular", "irregular" and 
"never" and was based upon the consistency of 
responses by mothers to the same questions on 
practice in the baseline and follow-up surveys. 
The following table illustrates how these defini­
tions were determined :

The risk of contracting diarrhea was lowest

"irregularly". The "regular warming of food

lowest incidence of diarrhea among all preventive 
behavior. "Never washing hands with soap before 
eating" and "never washing clothes of children 
with diarrhoea separately" was associated with 
the highest incidence (Table 2). 
The incidence of diarrhea also varied with the 
"method of disposal of diarrheal feces". Incidence 
was lowest among children whose mothers dis­
posed of diarrheal feces in the "toilet only" 
(6211,000 person months of exposure), interme­
diate among children whose mothers disposed of 
feces "underground only" (112/1,000 person 
months of exposure), and highest among children 
whose mothers dispose of feces "on the ground 
without burying" (207 I 1,000 person months of 
exposure). 
Table 3 displays those preventive behaviors 
which exhibited a substantially greater increase in 
the proportion in the experimental than in the 
control area. These were the boiling of drinking 
water and handwashing with soap among Buddhist 
women; hand-washing with soap before eating 
and disposal of diarrheal feces underground 
among Muslim women.

As seen in Table 4 the decline in diarrheal 
incidence was considerably higher in the experi­
mental than in the control area among children of 
Buddhist mothers who boiled their drinking water 
"regularly" and "irregularly"; and among chil­
dren of Muslim mothers who "irregularly" washed 
their hands with soap before eating and who "reg­
ularly" disposed of diarrheal feces "underground". 
It would appear therefore, that the impact of the 
intervention program upon the decline in diarrheal 
incidence occurred through its effect upon raising 
the proportions of women who practiced these 
three preventive behaviors. However, the program 
may have had an additional effect by contributing 
to an increase in the effectiveness of the practice 
of preventive behavior among (I) women who 
were already practicing at the time of the interven­
tion program, and who continued to practice 
"regularly" through the program period; and (2) 
women who practiced "irregularly" during the 
program period. If this is the case then the children 
of these women in the experimental area should 
exhibit a greater decline in diarrheal incidence 
than the children of these women in the control 
area.

The changes in diarrheal incidence among chil­
dren of mothers practicing selected preventive 
behaviors that did not show a greater increase in 
proportions in the experimental than in the con­
trol area are also shown in Table 4. The decline in 
diarrheal incidence among children of mothers 
who practiced these behaviors was consistently 
greater in the experimental area. This finding 
supports the assertion that the impact of the inter­
vention program upon diarrheal disease occurred 
in part through the program's ability to maintain 
and improve the effectiveness of preventive be­
haviors that were already being practiced; and to 
increase the effectiveness of preventive behaviors 
practiced irregularily during the intervention 
program. 
The analysis thus far has demonstrated that 
the intervention program affected diarrheal dis­
ease indirectly through its effect upon selected 
preventive health behavior. In order to gain addi­
tional understanding of how this occurred it is

necessary to investigate the program dynamics 
which may have contributed to this effect. The 
dynamics include the changes in service provider 
activities and the differences in activities between 
the experimental and control areas. 
Table 5 provides information on two indicators 
of program dynamics, home visits by VRV IVRCs 
and attendance by mothers at meetings held by 
VRV IVRCs during the intervention program. 
The increase in the proportions of mothers who 
were visited by VRV IVRCs four or more times in 
the experimental area reached over 70 points 
while among mothers in the control area the pro­
portions declined by more than 20 points. The 
proportion of Buddhist mothers visited four or 
more times by VRV IVRCs increased by almost 
80 points in the experimental area compared to an 
increase of slightly over 5 points in the control 
area. Muslim mothers in the experimental area 
exhibited an increase in visits by almost 20 points

30 points. 
The effective percent change (EPC) in propor­
tions of mothers in the experimental area who at­
tended three or more meetings conducted by 
VHV /VHCs was more than two times higher than 
the EPC among mothers in the control area. 
Among Buddhist and Muslim women in the ex­
perimental area the EPC was more than three and 
two times greater, respectively, than the EPC in 
the control area. 
Clearly the intervention program contributed 
to a greater increase in service provider activities 
compared to the control area. Hence, the remain­
ing step in the investigation was an assessment of 
the relative importance of these program indi­
cators for the practice of preventive health be­
havior. This was accomplished through a multiple 
regression analysis in which each of the preventive 
behaviors for the period July-December, 1988 in 
the experimental area is regressed on religious 
affiliation, maternal education and two program 
indicators, "visits by VHV /VHCs" and "number 
of meetings attended conducted by VHV /VHCs". 
As seen in Table 6 attendance at meetings con­
ducted by VHV /VHCs showed a significant rela­
tionship with the effects of the remaining pre­
dictors with "boiling of drinking water", "hand­
washing with soap" and "hand washing with soap 
before eating", while the "number of visits by 
VHV /VHCs" showed a significant relationship 
with "method of disposal of diarrheal feces" 
Hence, among the multitude of possible program 
dynamics which may have affected preventive 
health behavior, this analysis has shown that 
mothers attendance at meetings held by VHV I 
VHCs, and visits by VHV /VHCs exerted some 
effect upon their practice of selected preventive 
behaviors.
