Sixty-five mothers from Balai Lua, Central Lom- 
bok, Indonesia were given soap and an explanation of 
the faecal-oral route of diarrhoea transmission. This 
very simple health message was repeated and rein- 
forced fortnightly when mothers were also asked 
whether any members of their family had suffered 
from diarrhoea over the previous 2 weeks. Children of 
in 
these mothers experienced an 89% reduction 
diarrhoea episodes compared 
to a control period 
before the intervention. 
Many million children die of diarrhoea each year. 
Many more are chronically debilitated and become 
malnourished as a result of frequent episodes of 
diarrhoea which 
leave them susceptible to other 
infectious diseases. Much worthwhile effort has gone 
into promotion of diarrhoea 
treatment with oral 
rehydration salts but the interventions required to 
prevent diarrhoea are less well understood. Hand- 
washing breaks the cycle of diarrhoea acquisition 
(KHAN, 1982; FEACHEM, 1984). There have, how- 
ever, been few community-based investigations of the 
effect on diarrhoea control of encouraging hand- 
washing through health education uroarammes. 
In r&al Bangladesh, improved water-supply com- 
bined with hygiene education reduced diarrhoea 
incidence bv more than 40% (ALAM et al.. 1989). 
while in urban Burma hygiene education alone was as 
effective in reducing episodes of diarrhoea (but not 
dysentery) in the absence of better water and sanitary 
facilities (AUNG MYO HAN & THEIN HLAING, 1989). 
Promoting hand-washing with soap after defaeca- 
tion and before contact with food seems to be the 
simplest, fastest and most cost-effective method of 
reducing the major cause of childhood death and adult 
morbidity in an underprivileged society. This paper 
reports a very 
in Lombok, 
Indonesia. The work suffers from some methodolo- 
gical deficiencies (see BLUM & FEACHEM, 1983), but 
appears to have been effective in reducing diarrhoea 
nevertheless. 

Central Lombok has the highest infant mortality 
rate in Indonesia: the 1985 SUPAS (Sensus Penduduk 
Antar Sensus) supplementary census estimated the 
rate as 120 per 1000 live births. Most deaths were due 
to diarrhoea but little is known about its aetiology 
locally. The Sasak people of this region have poor 
expectations of health and survival. Since 1945 there 
have been 8 major famines in south Central Lombok 
‘Address for correspondence: Dr J. M. Wilson, 6 Sparrow 
Farm Road, Ewell, Epsom, Surrey, KT17 ZJL, UK. 
The study was conducted as part of a rural water 
supply and sanitation project. Two of the seven dusun 
(village administrative units) within the desa (small 
town) of Darek in Central Lombok were selected for 
the study: Tanggung Luak and Balai Lua Daya. 
These dusun were in the same neighbourhood but 
were not contiguous. Housing types were similar in 
both dusun but varied accordmg to the resources of 
the familv. The richest households had tiled roofs. 
brick walls and concrete floors while the poorest 
homes were built with thatched roofs, woven bamboo 
walls and mud floors. 
Darek had piped drinking water available for about 
3 years before the study. For washing, villagers used 
small unprotected brackish wells close to their houses 
or, when these were dry, one of 3 communal bathing 
places each served by a deep protected well. There 
was a good tarmac road to Darek, a weekly market, a 
government health centre (PusKesMas) 
and several 
schools. Most people worked in the rice fields but 
there was also some paid employment, for example as 
cidomo drivers (communal horse cart taxis), in small 
shops or as government employees. 

All women in Balai Lua Daya with a live child 
under the age of 11 years were approached and an 
interview requested. A small proportion (2%) were 
out of the village because of trading commitments and 
2 other women were too shy to be interviewed. Thus, 
65 women were asked details of all children alive or 
dead; enquiries were also made about the mothers’ 
knowledge, 
to 
hygiene, breastfeeding, weaning, and also about any 
episodes of illness in the family over the previous two 
weeks. The same questions were asked of 65 mothers 
in Tanggung Luak. 

After 2 weeks all 130 mothers were asked about any 
episodes of illness in the family since the last interview 
and how long these had lasted. This fortnightly 
disease review was repeated over the next 20 weeks. 
Diarrhoea episodes (maceret or diare) were defined as 
loose stools for more than 24 h. Since most women 
were illiterate they were unable to record disease 
episodes on calendars and it is possible that some 
disease episodes were overlooked. Certainly multiple 
disease episodes within one reporting period for the 
same child were exceptional. 
Eight weeks after the start of the study, meetings 
were held amonast the 65 mothers in Balai Lua, the 
village selected lfor the hand-washing intervention. 
The women were told that diarrhoea comes from 
faeces getting into the mouth by way of dirty hands, 
contaminated food, and flies which have first landed 











(JUDD, 1980) and innumerable deaths at these times 
have attracted foreign aid to the island. 



on faeces. To prevent diarrhoea it was suggested that 
the mothers should therefore (i) wash their hands with 
soap before preparing food; (ii) wash their hands with 
soap before eating; (iii) wash their childrens’ hands 
with soap before they eat; and (iv) wash their hands 
with soap as soon as possible after defaecation. Each 
woman was given a plastic soap dish and a bar of 
‘OK’@ soap (the brand most readily available in the 
villages, costing Rp 50, equivalent to 2 UK pence). 
The fortnightly disease reviews continued and were 
used to reinforce the hygiene messages, to talk about 
any health 
issues, and to replenish the soap as 
necessary. 
Fortnightly disease reviews also continued in Tang- 
gung Luak (the control village). Here the women 
were not given soap, and information about diarrhoea 
acquisition was given only in response to specific 
questions. However, mothers were told about oral 
rehydration therapy and encouraged to use this to 
treat any childhood diarrhoea. 
The survey covered 130 mothers and 315 children. 
The villages were similar in most indices, attitudes 
and hygiene practices. Many women (23%) associated 
dirt or poor sanitation with diarrhoea transmission 
and 25% thought that diarrhoea came from eating bad 
food. A few (2%) thought that measles was caused by 
poor sanitation. Maternal educational levels in the 2

villages differed somewhat (Table 
women were illiterate. Childhood deaths over the 
previous 10 years had all been of those aged 3 years or 
less; child mortality rates were declining but were still 
about 28%. Breastfeeding was almost universal; only 
3 children of 446 live births had been given formula 
from a bottle before the age of 3 months.

that childhood diarrhoea was 
commonest at the beginning of the rainy season in 
November. 
Table 2 lists the questionnaire responses relating to 
hygiene before and after the intervention. All adults 
claimed to wash their hands with water (but not soap) 
after defaecation and before eating meals. About 
three-quarters of mothers said they rinsed their 
childrens’ hands before they ate. Soap was rarely used 
but mothers knew the price and realized that it was 
always readily available in their village. Surprisingly, 
when soap was given out it was greeted with much 
comment, 
touching and smelling as if it was un- 
familiar. 
In the intervention village after the campaign, most 
women (92%) claimed to wash their hands with soap 
after defaecation and! although more thought soap 
was expensive (implymg perhaps that they had now 
considered buying it)? the proportion who considered 
that they had insufficient money dropped from 32% to 
12%. This suggests that an attitudinal change regard- 
ing the importance of soap had been achieved. 
The survey and fortnightly disease reviews pro- 
vided a list of disease events in each family. There 
were no records of chronic diarrhoea. Each new 
disease episode affecting children under 11 years was 
classified into (i) diarrhoea and/or vomiting, typhoid,

the short period of this study, hygiene 
education combined with distribution 
of soap 
appeared to induce an 89% fall in diarrhoea episodes 
compared to the pre-intervention phase of the study. 
This dramatic result must largely have been due to the 
very simple nature of the message and also to the 
intensive and personal nature of the hygiene educa- 
tion. Two of us (M. and J.) who were community 
organizers spent time discussing health issues with 
intervals over 20 
just 130 mothers at fortnightly 
weeks. Whether the good effects of this campaign will 
be sustained once the community organizers move to 
other villages remains to be seen.
