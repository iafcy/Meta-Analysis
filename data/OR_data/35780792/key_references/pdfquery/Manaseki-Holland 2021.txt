The Gambia has high rates of under-5 mortality from diarrhoea and pneumonia, peaking 
during complementary-feeding age. Community-based interventions may reduce comple- 
mentary-food contamination and disease rates. 

A public health intervention using critical control points and motivational drivers, delivered 
February–April 2015 in The Gambia, was evaluated in a cluster randomised controlled trial 
at 6- and 32-month follow-up in September–October 2015 and October–December 2017, 
respectively. After consent for trial participation and baseline data were collected, 30 villages 
(clusters) were randomly assigned to intervention or control, stratified by population size 
and geography. The intervention included a community-wide campaign on days 1, 2, 17, 
and 25, a reminder visit at 5 months, plus informal community-volunteer home visits. It pro- 
moted 5 key complementary-food and 1 key drinking-water safety and hygiene behaviours 
through performing arts, public meetings, and certifications delivered by a team from local 
health and village structures to all villagers who attended the activities, to which mothers of 
6- to 24-month-old children were specifically invited. Control villages received a 1-day

campaign on domestic-garden water use. The background characteristics of mother and 
clusters (villages) were balanced between the trial arms. Outcomes were measured at 6 
and 32 months in a random sample of 21–26 mothers per cluster. There were no interven- 
tion or research team visits to villages between 6 and 32 months. The primary outcome was 
a composite outcome of the number of times key complementary-food behaviours were 
observed as a proportion of the number of opportunities to perform the behaviours during 
the observation period at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the rate of each recom- 
mended behaviour; microbiological growth from complementary food and drinking water (6 
months only); and reported acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea, and diarrhoea hospitali- 
sation. Analysis was by intention-to-treat analysis adjusted by clustering. (Registration: 
PACTR201410000859336). We found that 394/571 (69%) of mothers with complementary- 
feeding children in the intervention villages were actively involved in the campaign. No vil- 
lages withdrew, and there were no changes in the implementation of the intervention. The 
intervention improved behaviour adoption significantly. For the primary outcome, the rate 
was 662/4,351(incidence rate [IR] = 0.15) in control villages versus 2,861/4,378 (IR = 0.65) 
in intervention villages (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 4.44, 95% CI 3.62–5.44, p < 
0.001), and at 32 months the aIRR was 1.17 (95% CI 1.07–1.29, p = 0.001). Secondary 
health outcomes also improved with the intervention: (1) mother-reported diarrhoea at 6 
months, with adjusted relative risk (aRR) = 0.39 (95% CI 0.32–0.48, p < 0.001), and at 32 
months, with aRR = 0.68 (95% CI 0.48–0.96, p = 0.027); (2) mother-reported diarrhoea hos- 
pitalisation at 6 months, with aRR = 0.35 (95% CI 0.19–0.66, p = 0.001), and at 32 months, 
with aRR = 0.38 (95% CI 0.18–0.80, p = 0.011); and (3) mother-reported acute respiratory 
tract infections at 6 months, with aRR = 0.67 (95% CI 0.53–0.86, p = 0.001), though at 32 
months improvement was not significant (p = 0.200). No adverse events were reported. The 
main limitations were that only medium to small rural villages were involved. Obtaining labo- 
ratory cultures from food at 32 months was not possible, and no stool microorganisms were 
investigated. 

We found that low-cost and culturally embedded behaviour change interventions were 
acceptable to communities and led to short- and long-term improvements in complemen- 
tary-food safety and hygiene practices, and reported diarrhoea and acute respiratory tract 
infections. 

The trial was registered on the 17th October 2014 with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry 
in South Africa with number (PACTR201410000859336) and 32-month follow-up as an 
amendment to the trial.

tion in 15 intervention and 15 control villages in rural Gambia and evaluated outcomes 
at 6 and 32 months post-intervention. 
• Target behaviours were identified through systematic assessment of motivational driv- 
ers for behaviour change and critical control points (CCPs) for contamination in com- 
plementary-food preparation and handling practices identified through a hazard 
analysis assessment. 
• The intervention was implemented at the community level and focussed on mothers of 
young children; it was delivered by a combination of performing arts, public meetings, 
household visits, commitment ceremonies, and certifications of mothers and 
communities. 
• Sixty-nine percent of mothers with complementary-feeding-age children were actively 
involved in the campaign. At 6 months post-intervention, adoption of behaviours was 
high; child’s reported diarrhoea, hospital admission for diarrhoea, and respiratory dis- 
ease were reduced by 60%, 60%, and 30%, respectively. At 32 months post-intervention, 
mothers in control villages had adopted some of the behaviours promoted by the inter- 
vention (intervention ‘cross-contamination’), but practice of the behaviours in the inter- 
vention villages remained significantly higher, with a 30% reduction in reported 
diarrhoea and a 40% reduction in hospital admissions for diarrhoea. 

• These outcomes were achieved without further programmatic input after 5 months. 
Mothers without babies at the time of the programme were subsequently engaged by 
community members and adopted the behaviours. 





Globally, 1.73 billion diarrhoea episodes and 120 million pneumonias are estimated to occur 
in children aged <5 years each year, resulting in approximately 2 million deaths in 2010 [1]. 
Enteric diseases further result in infant malnutrition [2–4]. Despite new vaccine and treatment 
measures [3], these diseases are an immense public health problem in low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs), and are targeted by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
The complementary-food period is when a child starts eating solids but does not yet eat the 
family meal (usually 6 to 24 months of age). It is associated with the highest rates of diarrhoea 
and respiratory infections: 72% of deaths from diarrhoea and 81% from pneumonia occur in 
children younger than 2 years, while >50% of all diarrhoea deaths occur at 6–11 months of 
age, when complementary food is first introduced [1]. High rates of diarrhoea continue in chil- 
dren aged 12–24 months [1]. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 600 million episodes of illness, 
420,000 deaths, and 33 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were attributable to con- 
sumption of contaminated food worldwide in 2010 (which excludes diseases related to milk, 
water, and other drinks) [5]. This emphasises the considerable public health impact of contam- 
inated food. Importantly, children <5 years of age experienced 43% of the food-borne disease 
(FBD) burden and DALYs globally, despite representing only 9% of the global population. 
Regionally, Africa had the greatest burden, although the WHO estimates were conservative 
since they largely excluded diarrhoeal disease associated with human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection [5], which makes patients particularly vulnerable. 
The most plausible approach to prevent diarrhoeal infection is to avoid ingestion of con- 
taminated food and water. In contrast with the many studies assessing the effects of improved 
water and sanitation on diarrhoeal disease, the majority of food safety efforts have been too 
general to succeed in interrupting possible disease transmission pathways [6,7]. In particular, 
insufficient attention has been devoted to food safety and food hygiene practices aimed at pre- 
paring and handling complementary food or household food [6,7]. The WHO has called for 
rigorous studies and interventions to prevent complementary-food contamination [5–7], but 
there is a paucity of public health or community-level intervention trials with health outcomes. 



• We demonstrate that these low-cost, culturally embedded interventions are acceptable, 
adopted, and sustained at the community level, with high levels of behaviour change 
and reported reduction in diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection outcomes in the 
short term, and significant long-term effects. 

tion; although our findings are limited to small rural villages, these are nonetheless com- 
mon in low- and middle-income countries. Our conclusions need to be tested in urban 
and peri-urban settings. 
• To date, insufficient attention has been devoted to food safety and food hygiene prac- 
tices aimed at preparing, handling, and feeding complementary food. There have also 
been insufficient assessments of programmes with cultural performing arts that can 
engage whole communities to support mothers with behaviour change. 


We applied the findings from rapid assessment formative research in The Gambia [8,9] to a 
previous community-level intervention, evaluated in a before-and-after 8-cluster randomised 
controlled trial (RCT) in Nepal [10,11]. We developed a less intensive, low-cost, community- 
based behaviour change intervention for complementary-food safety and hygiene [8] delivered 
through local public health and community structures. We investigated the effects of this com- 
plex intervention using a cluster RCT design in rural Gambia on the following outcomes: the 
proportion of occasions mothers were observed to practice 5 key food-related behaviours at 6 
months (primary outcome), the proportion of occasions mothers were observed to boil drink- 
ing water, microbiological contamination in complementary food and drinking water, and 
children’s rates of diarrhoea, diarrhoea hospital admission, and respiratory infection. 

The methods are in part previously published [8,9] and available in S1 and S2 Protocols, and 
summarised below. The CONSORT framework for reporting of cluster RCTs has been used 
[12] (S1 CONSORT Checklist). 

This was a 1:1 parallel cluster RCT where the unit of randomisation was a whole village. The 
intervention was village-wide and targeted mothers of complementary-food-age children. The 
main intervention was delivered over 25 days (4 community campaign visits by an interven- 
tion team and village volunteers encouraging mothers in between campaign visits) [8] and was 
followed by a reminder visit to villages after 5 months. Three cross-sectional samples were 
taken to measure characteristics and outcomes: at baseline before randomisation and at 6- and 
32-month post-intervention campaign events [8]. 

The study was conducted in The Gambia’s Central River Region (CRR) (S1 Box). CRR is The 
Gambia’s poorest region, with the highest rates of diarrhoea [13]. Villages with a population of 
200–1,450 were eligible for inclusion because (1) the majority of the villages/towns in CRR are 
this size [14], (2) there were insufficient young children in smaller villages to provide a suffi- 
cient sample size (of >20 mothers), and (3) larger villages would have required the inclusion 
of additional public health officers in the team. All villages were Primary Health Care Pro- 
gramme (PHC) villages and had a male village health worker (VHW) and a traditional birth 
attendant (TBA), both of whom had completed a 4-week Gambian Ministry of Health (MoH) 
training programme. At the time of the study, the MoH was in the process of extending this 
programme to all villages nationally, and such community volunteers are common in sub- 
Saharan rural settings. Therefore, these inclusion criteria should ensure generalisability of our 
intervention. It was anticipated that TBAs could also act as our project volunteers and together 
with VHWs could informally encourage community participation (in practice, when village 
elders were asked to appoint women volunteers, in most cases other women were nominated 
and not the TBAs, but still the TBAs and VHWs, amongst other prominent villagers, were 
engaged and assisted the programme—see Discussion). Villages within 5 km of already 
selected villages, villages involved in the formative research, and the pilot villages were 
excluded to prevent cross-contamination. 

mothers with children aged 6–24 months. The total number of children in the village was 
determined at baseline through census-like household visits (November–December 2014). At 
6 and 32 months, the list was updated using lists maintained by VHWs and maternal and child 




health clinics (during September–October 2015 and October–December 2017, respectively). 
Non-residents and those expecting to leave the village within 6 months of the study were 
excluded at baseline, and households absent during the period of intervention were excluded 
from the sampling frame for follow-up. Mothers of children aged 6–36 months were eligible 
for inclusion in the 32-month follow-up (no exclusion criteria). This meant that mothers with 
children younger than 26 months had yet to give birth during the intervention team’s 25-day 
village campaign and the fifth (5-month reminder) community visit (hereafter termed ‘new 
mothers’). Children 26–32 months of age at 32-month follow-up were <6 months old and 
therefore not officially complementary-food age during the campaign and reminder visit. 

In November–December 2014, 30 of 55 eligible clusters were selected at random, heads of vil- 
lages were visited, consent obtained, and baseline data collected. Thereafter, 15 clusters were 
randomly allocated to each arm within strata (by north or south of the Gambia River and by 
quartiles of village population size) using a computerised random number generator [8]. Chil- 
dren were randomly selected at 6 and 32 months from the list of all village children in the cho- 
sen cluster using a random number list generated in Excel by a statistician (KH). 
Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of mothers and the intervention team was 
not possible. However, mothers and data collectors were masked to the assessment of the out- 
comes as follows: At both the 6- and 32-month assessments, mothers were informed that the 
assessment was investigating domestic water and food usage by observing their daily activities. 
New data collectors were independently recruited in each round and were unaware of the exis- 
tence of the intervention or the inter-village comparison. Complementary-food safety and 
hygiene components of the assessment tools were concealed in a larger assessment, with a 
package of observation tools and questionnaires about household food and water use, mother 
and child activities (including observation and a questionnaire on child care and play activi- 
ties), health-seeking, food for family and baby, water and sanitation, income in the household, 
and village activities. Thus, the data collectors were trained for, and mothers consented to, the 
conduct of this larger assessment of the household’s food and water consumption, health, and 
child care (all measures taken to reduce reactivity and observation bias are summarised in S2 
Box). 



The behaviour change intervention was theoretically based [8]. The main theoretical basis for 
the intervention was (1) psychological and motivational theories for hygienic behaviour 
change [15,16] aiming to influence individual and community social norms and (2) identifica- 
tion of corrective behaviours through the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) 
system [17,18]. In HACCP, a critical control point (CCP) is a step or procedure at which a sig- 
nificant hazard occurs in food processing or handling, and at which control or corrective mea- 
sures can be applied to prevent or minimise the hazard [17]. The corrective measures and 
motivators were identified during rapid assessment formative research [8,9] and delivered 
through a complex campaign-like community intervention. These measures and motivators 
were informed by, and included components from, community intervention studies on com- 
plementary-food safety and hygiene in Nepal [10,11] and handwashing in India [19], and were 
adapted to the local context after formative research [8,9]. The complex community interven- 
tion, if successful, was envisaged to enable a degree of shift to the social norm at the 




community level that would enable long-term behaviour change in villagers. A detailed 
description is provided elsewhere [8,9] and summarised in S3 Box, S1 and S2 Tables. 

each village over 25 days (4 community campaign visits by 3 local health promotion/public 
health officers and 2 dramatic artists on days 1, 2, 17 and 25, and trained older mother village 
volunteers, the MaaSupervisors, who encouraged the mothers to follow best food safety and 
hygiene practice in between campaign visits) [8], hereafter called the 25-day village campaign. 
Approximately 5 months after the 25-day village campaign (in July–August 2015) during the 
rainy season, which is a busy period in village life when villagers might struggle to persist with 
the key behaviours, a visit by the intervention team sought to remind villagers about the behav- 
iours. During the fourth and fifth (5-month reminder) campaign visits, communities were 
encouraged to continue the behaviours and disseminate them among ‘new mothers’ with no 
incentive or contact from outside their community. 
Control villages received a 1-day health education campaign visit from a public health offi- 
cer on water use in domestic vegetable gardening, including a whole community meeting. The 
intervention and control village activities were delivered in parallel in February–April 2015 
(the dry season). There was no further contact with the villages by intervention or assessment 
teams after the 6-month follow-up until the 32-month follow-up. 

Assessments were conducted 6 and 32 months after the 25-day village campaign. The primary 
outcome was the difference between the intervention and control clusters at 6 months in the 
number of times 5 key complementary-food-related behaviours (defined in S3 Table) were 
observed as a proportion of the number of opportunities to perform the behaviours during the 
observation period. As an example of an opportunity, every time a mother started cooking/ 
preparing food for a child during the observation period, she should have washed her hands 
with soap first; did she do so or not? The mother’s behaviour when starting to cook baby food 
is an opportunity to demonstrate the practice of washing hands with soap before cooking. Sec- 
ondary outcomes are listed and defined in S3 Table. Boiling water, which was also promoted, 
was measured as a secondary outcome, since complementary-food safety and hygiene was the 
main focus of the intervention. 

At baseline, a trained researcher visited a random selection of village households with children 
aged 6–24 months and completed a short questionnaire on background characteristics of fami- 
lies plus reported diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection (ARI) in the past 7 days. This sur- 
vey took less than 15 minutes per household. 
Assessments were 6 and 32 months after the 25-day village campaign, September–October 
2015 (rainy season) and October–December 2017 (dry season), respectively. Further interim 
surveys were not conducted in order to reduce assessment rounds that might increase reactiv- 
ity bias in mothers [19]. After the 5-month reminder visit by the intervention team and the 
6-month follow-up by an independent assessment team, there were no further contacts with 
the villages until the 32-month follow-up. 
At the 6- and 32-month assessments, the families were not notified of the impending assess- 
ment visit. Village heads provided written (informed) permission for all study activities before 
randomisation at baseline. The mothers provided written informed consent the evening before 
the observation days at 6 and 32 months. The next day, the female data collector arrived in the 
household as the mother was beginning her day making breakfast (typically between 6:30 and 




7:30 AM). Methodology and tools for data collection at both the 6- and 32-month assessments 
were similar and were adapted from the Nepal study [10,11]. Separate groups of 12th-grade- 
graduate female data collectors from outside the study communities were recruited through 
secondary schools in CRR, and each was trained for approximately 3.5 weeks. They visited 1 
village per day as a team and were each assigned to a mother. They completed a structured 
observation checklist from 6:30 AM to 3:00 PM, when mothers prepared the complementary 
food at breakfast and lunch and fed the child. All opportunities to perform the 5 key behav- 
iours and boil water were recorded. 
A socio-demographic questionnaire used at the end of the observations included sections 
on economic evaluation; health education; incidence of diarrhoea, ARI, and hospitalisation for 
the child; and other questions for diversion and nested studies. Such components included a 
set of questions on health facility utilisation and other health economic issues, child activity 
and play, health and nutrition education, and influences on the mother. 
At 6-month follow-up, data collectors collected 2 samples of complementary food asepti- 
cally [20]: 1 immediately after the morning preparation before feeding the child, and 1 after 
storage of the food made in the morning before feeding at lunch time. Water prepared for the 
child was also sampled [20]. Samples were cultured for Escherichia coli coliforms in the Ban- 
sang District Hospital microbiology laboratory by trained study laboratory staff using estab- 
lished protocols [20]. The methods have been elaborated in S4 Box. 
At 6- and 32-month follow-up, data collectors and families were masked to the existence of 
a trial and of a comparison between the arms as explained in the ‘Randomisation and masking’ 
section and S1 Box. 

Formative research indicated that the population proportion of events displaying recom- 
mended handwashing behaviours was 17/150 (11.3%) [8,9]. The sample size was calculated to 
detect a 25% increase in behaviours in the intervention over the control arm at 6 months with 
95% power, a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.04 [19], 
and a coefficient of variation of cluster size of 0.22. With 15 clusters per arm, at least 12 moth- 
ers per cluster were required [21]. To account for possible drop-outs during the 9-hour home 
visit, 20 mothers were randomly selected from each village at 6 months. The study was robust 
to changes to the ICC, and would have over 80% power for all likely values of the ICC (0.01 to 
0.1). At 32 months, 24–26 mothers were randomly selected per stratified village, aiming to 
recruit 10–12 mothers with children �26 months of age and 12–16 with children 6–25 months 
of age (‘new mothers’). No interim analysis was conducted. 

Data were entered and checked in an Excel database. All analyses were performed using Stata 
version 14. For all outcomes, the analysis was by intention to treat. As randomisation was con- 
ducted at the village level, a mixed-effect model allowed clustering within villages for all mod- 
els that follow. Three models were run for each outcome: an unadjusted model, a partially 
adjusted model for village-level stratification covariates specified for the primary outcome 
analysis (north/south of river and village size), and a fully adjusted model with further adjust- 
ment for pre-specified covariates (mother’s age and education, sex of child, and number of 
children in household). 
Count outcomes (e.g., behaviours) were analysed using a mixed-effect Poisson model with 
an offset for the number of opportunities to exhibit the behaviours. Binary outcomes were ana- 
lysed using mixed-effect Poisson regression with a log-link and robust standard errors. 




Continuous outcomes were analysed using a mixed-effect linear regression model. Log-trans- 
formation accommodated non-normality (microbiological findings). As a sensitivity analysis, 
we performed the partially adjusted analysis and fully adjusted analysis with adjustments for 
cluster-level baseline rates of the outcome. Baseline data were only available for mother- 
reported ARI and diarrhoea. Furthermore, over-dispersion in the analysis of the count out- 
comes was checked through sensitivity analysis, and no evidence of over-dispersion was 
found. 
A subgroup analysis of the 32-month follow-up data, using interaction tests, was used to 
assess whether the intervention effect differed for children aged �26 months compared to 
those children aged <26 months (new mothers). 

The protocol was registered on 17 October 2014 with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry in 
South Africa with reference PACTR201410000859336, with 32-month follow-up as an amend- 
ment to the trial. 

The trial protocol for the 6-month follow-up is provided in S1 Protocol, and for the 32-month 
follow-up in S2 Protocol. 

Written and oral information was provided and informed written permission from the village 
head was obtained for the participation of the villages before randomisation. All mothers par- 
ticipating in the baseline and assessment surveys gave written informed consent. All informa- 
tion was read out in case of illiteracy (a written copy of the study information was left), and a 
thumb print was obtained in the presence of a family witness and the data collector. The study 
was approved by The Gambia Government/MRC Joint Ethics Committee (reference: 
SCC1385) and the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Ethical Review Com- 
mittee at the University of Birmingham (reference: ERN 14–0574). All the information col- 
lected was kept strictly confidential, accessed only for study purposes, and analysed after 
personal identifiers were removed. 

Minor changes to the protocol took place after registration, but before the start of the interven- 
tion and assessment fieldwork. These included the addition of the secondary outcome ‘diar- 
rhoea hospitalisation in the last episode’ and the collection of cost data for child’s diarrhoea 
disease. 
The original protocol did not explicitly plan a follow-up beyond the 6 months. As funds 
became available, the 32-month follow-up was added and registered as an amendment to the 
trial before data collection began. However, due to lack of funds, quality-assured E. coli labora- 
tory tests on food and water and clinic data collection could not be completed (secondary out- 
comes). At 32 months, subgroup analysis for new mothers was conducted, given the 
importance of sustainability of any behaviours being practiced by new mothers. As there had 
been no visits by intervention or study teams since the 6-month assessment, new mothers’ 
adoption of practices indicated community promotion of the behaviours with new mothers 
who were not even pregnant at the time of the campaign. 





Fifteen clusters were allocated to each arm (intervention and control), with 21 mothers (or a 
main carer) surveyed in each village at baseline [8] (total 600) and 6-month follow-up (total 
615), and 22–26 mothers were surveyed per village at 32 months (total 747) (Fig 1). No village 
or family refused to participate, and none withdrew during observations. Mothers were the 
main carers in nearly all families (Table 1). 
The characteristics of villages and mothers were balanced between the arms at baseline [8] 
(S4 and S5 Tables) and at 6- and 32-month follow-up (Table 1). At baseline, in the dry season 
(low diarrhoea risk), approximately 24% (142/600) of mothers in both arms reported their 
child had at least 1 diarrhoea episode in the previous 7 days, and 10% (60/600) reported their 
child had ARI in the previous 7 days (see S5 Table and previous publication [8]). Similar values 
were found in the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey of 2010, at 26.5% and 14.2%, respectively 
[13], also conducted in the dry season. 
In terms of participation in the activities of the 25-day village campaign, the MaaChampion 
mothers competition enabled mothers to stage their behaviour change, achieving the status of 
pledged, sustained, and role-model mothers during the 4 visits over the 25-day village cam- 
paign (see S3 Box). At the end of the 5-month visit, of the 571 mothers of 6- to 24-month-old 
children in the 15 intervention villages, there were 7% (40/571) MaaFamboos (pledged moth- 
ers), 11% (63/571) MaaSawar (sustained mothers), and 51% (291/571) MaaChampions (role- 
model mothers). A total of 69% (394/571) of the mothers engaged at some level. All interven- 
tion villages were given the status of ‘Complementary-food Hygiene Village’ although 2 did 
not quite reach the 50% MaaChampion status amongst their mothers with children of comple- 
mentary-food age. 

mother had learnt about complementary-food practices (with no prompting for answer 
options), at the 6-month follow-up 73% (223/370) of mothers in the intervention villages 
explicitly mentioned identifiable components of our intervention. One mother reported this 
in a control village. 

mary outcome 5 key behaviours. The rate of recommended behaviours was 662/4,351 (inci- 
dence rate [IR] = 0.15) in the control villages versus 2,861/4,378 (IR = 0.65) in the intervention 
villages (adjusted IR ratio [aIRR] = 4.44, 95% CI 3.62–5.44; Table 2). There was also a substan- 
tial effect on the practice of all individual complementary-food and drinking water safety and 
hygiene behaviours, with aIRRs ranging from 3.27 (95% CI 2.79–3.83) for washing pots and 
utensils and drying them on a clean surface before food preparation to 212.20 (95% CI 52.90– 
852.00) for boiling the child’s drinking water (Table 2). E. coli counts on the 2 complementary- 
food and water samples were significantly lower in the intervention arm than in the control 
arm (Table 3), confirming the differences observed in the behaviour observations. 
The intervention led to a dramatic reduction in reported diarrhoea episodes and reported 
hospital admissions in the rainy season (reported diarrhoea cases 202 [66%] in the control ver- 
sus 80 [26%] in the intervention villages, and reported hospitalisation cases 21[7%] versus 8 
[3%], respectively; adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 0.39, 95% CI 0.32–0.48, and aRR = 0.35, 95% 
CI 0.19–0.66, respectively), and the risk of reported ARI (reported ARI cases 129 [42%] in the 
control versus 86 [28%] in the intervention villages; aRR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.53–0.86). Other out- 
comes (Table 4) included a higher soap availability in kitchens and in latrines in intervention 
villages than in control villages. 
At 32 months, 66% (494/747) of mothers were new mothers, with infants born after the 
5-month reminder visit (S7 and S8 Tables); a further 19% (144/747) delivered their babies after

‡Primary outcome. The 5 key practices were (1) handwashing with soap and water before food preparation/cooking, (2) washing of pots and utensils and drying them 
on a clean surface before cooking and/or serving food, (3) handwashing with soap and water during food preparation/cooking if hands became contaminated, (4) 
handwashing with soap and water before feeding child, and (5) reheating stored complementary-food before second feeding to the child.

the 25-day village campaign (babies were not yet complementary-feeding age during the deliv- 
ery of the intervention 25-day village campaign or the 5-month reminder visit to the village). 
At 32 months, in an open-ended question (without explicit mention of the programme name 
or activities), only 18% (67/370) of mothers in the intervention group and 6% (22/377) in the 
control group reported that they had heard about complementary food through programmes 
whose descriptions explicitly sounded like our campaign activities. There was an increase in 
complementary-food safety and hygiene behaviours in the control villages; for example, 
reheating stored complementary food was nearly never practiced during our formative 
research and in control villages at 6-month follow-up, but reached an IR of 48% at 32 months. 
This rate was similar to the 50% rate in the intervention group, thus making the IR ratio not 
statistically significant between the arms. The lapse of over 2 years with no programmatic 
activities meant that fewer mothers were practicing the behaviours in our intervention arm, 
and this, together with an increase in the behaviours in control villages, led to the effect sizes

�E. coli counts were modelled using the log10 scale. However, we have back-transformed the results to the original scale. As a result of this transformation, we are using 
geometric means to summarise the coliform counts in the control and intervention arm. 
��The treatment effect presented here is a ratio of the geometric mean in the treatment arm compared to the geometric mean in the control arm. For example, a ratio of 
geometric means of 0.36 (0.17 to 0.76) suggests that the geometric mean in the intervention arm is about 36% of that under the control condition. The 95% CI of 0.17 to 
0.76 suggests that the geometric mean in the intervention arm is between 17% and 76% of that under the control condition.

being reduced. There was a significant increase in the practice of the 5 key behaviours in the 
intervention arm (rate of recommended behaviours in the control villages was 1,702/4,255 
[IR = 0.40] versus 1,919/4,121 [IR = 0.47] in the intervention villages; aIRR = 1.17, 95% CI 
1.07–1.29; Table 2). There was also a higher rate of practice of all individual complementary- 
food and drinking-water safety and hygiene behaviours in intervention villages, with all but 
reheating complementary food and washing pots and utensils showing a statistically significant 
difference between the arms and with aIRRs ranging from 1.58 (95% CI 1.26–2.01) for washing 
hands before cooking to 20.10 (95% CI 8.30–48.50) for boiling the child’s drinking water 
(Table 2). The intervention led to a reduction in reported diarrhoea episodes and hospital 
admissions in the beginning of the dry season (reported diarrhoea cases of 102 [27%] in the 
control versus 69 [19%] in the intervention villages, and reported hospitalisation cases 15 [6%] 
versus 5 [2%], respectively; aRR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.48–0.96, and aRR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.18–0.80, 
respectively), but the risk of reported ARI, though reduced in the intervention arm, was not 
statistically significantly different between the arms. Soap in kitchens and latrines was also 
observed significantly more frequently in the intervention arm (Table 4). 
For all outcomes, the precision of the estimate (i.e., the confidence interval) in the unad- 
justed model was changed (and mostly improved) by adjusting for cluster randomisation vari- 
ables and by adjusting for additional covariates in the fully adjusted models. The sensitivity 
analysis adjusting for baseline reported diarrhoea and ARI was consistent with the main analy- 
sis (S6 Table). 
The subgroup analysis for new mothers was consistent with the main analysis (S7 and S8 
Tables). There was no evidence of interaction between intervention and child’s age (dichoto- 
mised at 26 months).

The variance component of the random effect for village for the primary composite out- 
come was 0.065 (SE 0.0217) at 6-month follow-up and 0.010 (SE 0.005) at 32-month follow- 
up. 



8 months was $16,300 (2014 US dollars), $28.53 per 6- to 24-month-old child, and $3.12 per 
population member at the time of the campaign (cost per head is less if new 6-month-old chil- 
dren for the period 6–32 months are included). This was the cost after formative research iden- 
tified behaviours and motivators, and the tools were developed (the University of Birmingham 
is currently developing an intervention manual containing the tools). For a new cultural 




setting in a low- or middle-income country, an additional US$7,000–US$12,000 (as per The 
Gambia costs in 2018) might be required to conduct the contextualisation and adapt the tools. 

To our knowledge we present the first trial of a complex community-level intervention of com- 
plementary-food safety and hygiene with behaviour change and health outcomes. The theory- 
based campaign-like and self-sustaining community intervention was implemented in rural 
villages of a low-income country, The Gambia. At 6 months, we found the intervention was 
highly effective in improving mothers’ complementary-food preparation and handling prac- 
tices, reducing microbiological contamination of food and water, and increasing the availabil- 
ity of soap in kitchens and latrines. These findings corresponded with a reduced incidence of 
reported diarrhoea, diarrhoea hospitalisation, and respiratory infection. While there was no 
programmatic input for 26 months, the intervention behaviours were sustained and passed on 
to new mothers 32 months post-intervention. Reported health outcomes were still significantly 
improved at long-term follow-up despite the fact that the study sample size and the implemen- 
tation of the intervention were not planned to detect an impact at 32 months. As expected, at 
32-month follow-up, after 26 months of no contact with the programme, the rate of practice of 
behaviours in the intervention communities was reduced and there may have been cross-con- 
tamination in control villages for some of the behaviours. The cross-contamination means that 
the reduction in effect size for outcomes was more pronounced and not entirely due to a 
reduced rate of behaviours practiced in the intervention villages. Nevertheless, most behav- 
iours were still practised at significantly higher rates in the intervention communities, with 
increased presence and use of soap in kitchens and latrines, and reduced reported diarrhoea 
rate and diarrhoea hospitalisation in 6- to 24-month-old children. From a public health point 
of view, a reduction in diarrhoea at 32 months is important given that the majority of house- 
holds in sub-Saharan Africa have children <5 years old, and as a result of the need to cook 
food for them, diarrhoea is very common. Furthermore, the effect size was much higher at 6 
months, suggesting that over the period of 32 months, the average effect size was more signifi- 
cant than at 32 months. 
Importantly, new mothers in the intervention villages practised the key behaviours at a 
higher rate than those in the control villages. Qualitative data collected at 32 months (manu- 
script in preparation) demonstrate embedding of the programme behaviours and new mothers 
being taught by existing role-model mothers (MaaChampions) and older mother volunteers 
(MaaSupervisors), which points to the sustainability of the intervention with minimal 
resources. 
The 6-month results are supported by clinic visit data from another study on diagnoses 
made at clinic visits for children <5 years old in CRR (manuscript in preparation; see S5 Box). 
Taal [22] retrospectively collected data on diagnoses of children visiting clinics in the first 7 
months after the 25-day campaign activities, which indicated a statistically significant reduc- 
tion in the incidence of cases of diarrhoea that were reported to the health facilities by our 
intervention versus control villagers. 
Our study builds on a smaller cluster RCT of a similar but longer and more intensive inter- 
vention in Nepal, which found similar results when investigating behaviour and microbiology 
outcomes 1 month after the intervention [10,11]. Unpublished exploratory analysis of diar- 
rhoea outcomes in Nepal indicated that the incidence of diarrhoea reported by mothers was 
also significantly reduced by more than half in the intervention villages. The small number of 
clusters (8) potentially limited the study generalisability and internal validity due to inflated 
type I errors. A systematic review of the literature revealed no comparable studies. Apart from 




application to industry or food outlets, HACCP analysis has been applied to household assess- 
ments [17,23–26], but only 3 small trials (all from collaborations within our group) success- 
fully applied HACCP to developing recommended behaviour change measures for safe 
preparation and handling of complementary food by mothers in LMICs. Apart from the com- 
munity study in Nepal, the other 2 feasibility trials were intended to demonstrate that the use 
of HACCP in programming and that complementary-food preparation behaviour change 
could reduce microbiological contamination of complementary food. The interventions were 
too resource intensive for programmatic purposes as they randomised mothers individually 
and involved teaching the behaviours to individual mothers during home visits [10,20,27]. 
Other trials involving complementary-food safety or hygiene were mostly quasi-experimental, 
were not community-based, and only involved limited aspects, such as storage interventions 
or the benefits of fermenting complementary food [28,29]. Otherwise, trials including aspects 
of food safety or hygiene primarily focussed on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) or 
childhood nutrition (such as handwashing before cooking or eating), without a systematic 
assessment of complementary-food-related hazardous behaviours before or after the interven- 
tions or an explicit focus on complementary-food safety/hygiene [30–33]. 
It is important to note that no matter how nutritious or deficient the complementary food 
is, if contaminated it is hazardous to the young child with an underdeveloped immune system. 
Therefore, our intervention has notable implications regardless of the nutrient composition of 
the child’s diet [5]. In our study, diarrhoea reduction (60%) and ARI reduction (30%) at 
6-month follow-up are amongst the highest recorded from any WaSH or other community 
programme [30–32]. The impact on respiratory infections reflects the links between respira- 
tory infection and handwashing [34,35]. Our findings are noteworthy since the study sample 
size was not initially powered to detect any difference in ARI, diarrhoea, hospitalisation report- 
ing, or clinic visits, nor to detect any significant difference in outcomes at 32 months, espe- 
cially because a dilution in effect of the intervention would be expected without further 
programmatic input, incentives, supervision, or re-training [22]. 
Our data demonstrate an apparent cross-contamination and adoption of behaviours 
among mothers in the control villages at 32 months. We believe this was likely to be mainly 
through intervention villagers promoting the ideas themselves since the regional public health 
office confirmed that no further promotion of complementary-food safety and hygiene had 
been conducted by their staff in any villages in the region (CRR) after the reminder visit at 5 
months. Qualitative data at 32 months also suggests that mothers in intervention villages felt it 
their duty to inform mothers about complementary-food safety and hygiene practices when 
visiting other villages. Our nested-study data about family-food-related cooking (which 
showed significantly improved family-food safety behaviours in intervention villages at 32 
months) further reconfirms that the behaviours were embedded into mothers’ daily practices 
(manuscript in preparation). This behaviour change during preparing and handling family 
food explains the reduced reported diarrhoea rates in older children (24–36 months), who usu- 
ally start eating from the family food. 
This low-cost intervention was not only acceptable to the mothers and the communities at 
large but was, at least in part, self-sustaining since new mothers were practicing the behaviours 
at 32 months. Such self-sustaining interventions over several years have rarely been investi- 
gated or demonstrated for other WaSH or nutrition intervention trials. Focus group discus- 
sions conducted at 32-month follow-up across mothers, grandmothers, and fathers 
(manuscript in preparation) confirmed the quantitative evidence that key behaviours were 
remembered by fathers and elders and were effectively communicated by villagers to new 
mothers, leading to further adoption of target behaviours. This was said to be driven by Maa- 
Champions and MaaSupervisors tasked with the goal of promoting the behaviours at the 




fourth campaign day visit. The qualitative data indicate that community participation tech- 
niques, especially the performing arts, were important for successful intervention delivery 
[32]. Villagers retained fond memories of a joyous programme with songs and activities of tra- 
ditional performing artists, and they treasured the achievements of MaaChampions in their 
family and community. 
We therefore attribute the success of the intervention to the following factors: (1) the sys- 
tematic focus on complementary-food safety and hygiene in programming, (2) the use of a the- 
ory-based programme utilising motivational drivers for behaviour change, (3) the application 
of joyous dramatic arts for portraying messages and motivational drivers, (4) whole commu- 
nity involvement including fathers and community leaders, and (5) peer support and educa- 
tion including older mothers and role-model mothers. These elements promote a change in 
social norms, support the mothers in their efforts to follow recommended behaviours, and 
substantially improve outcomes from home-visit-focussed interventions. 

(HACCP [17,18] and motivational drivers [15,16]), community involvement, and the use of 
culturally embedded performing arts. We provide evidence that the intervention can poten- 
tially be scaled up in similar rural settings given its low cost (S3 Box) and ease of delivery 
through local village and health structures (local health promotion/public health officers, tradi- 
tional performing artists, and community health volunteers, as opposed to research staff). We 
demonstrate the ease of adapting tools previously developed in Asian programmes (S2 Table) 
[10,11,19], which enhances the transferability of the intervention and its wider replication 
across continents and cultures. As with other successful community participation pro- 
grammes, monetary incentives or gifted goods were not required to secure participation [36]. 

to the intervention. However, it does not follow that lack of blinding meant that mothers or 
data collection teams would automatically link activities in their villages to the evaluation visits 
at their homes because there was no clear link made to them by the research team. Although 
there was no evidence of bias in carer-reported diarrhoea data, socially sensitive intervention 
evaluations such as those targeting hygiene are prone to reactivity bias in study participants, 
and it is possible that differences between groups were influenced by this bias. However, at 
both 6 and 32 months, the control and intervention villages were likely to have similar rates of 
reactivity bias as neither would expect any connection between the home visit for assessment 
and the intervention. The home visit at 6 months was the first long home visit observation for 
data collection (meaning mothers were not sensitised to study-related methods of data collec- 
tion), and the data collectors were from villages not participating in the study and so were 
unaware of the intervention. For the 32-month visit, villagers had had no interaction with the 
study or intervention team for over 2 years, and over 75% of the mothers assessed had no 
weaning child at the time of intervention activities (new mothers). Additionally, we took 
exceptional care to minimise reactivity bias using established methods [19,37,38] (S2 Box) 
including designing the trial to reduce the exposure of the study population to the trial proce- 
dures, using random cross-sectional samples to observe mothers’ behaviours in each commu- 
nity (reducing the likelihood of mothers being surveyed more than once), and limiting home 
observations to only 2 occasions 25 months apart. To ensure there was minimal discussion 
about the home visits, the assessment teams stayed only 1 day in each village. To reduce moth- 
ers being affected by assessment of complementary-food safety (reactivity bias) or the staff 
focussing on our study outcomes (observation bias), at the 6- and 32-month assessments, the 
complementary-food safety and hygiene purpose of the assessment was concealed from the 
mothers and data collectors. This was achieved through conducting a larger assessment and 
embedding the complementary-food safety and hygiene assessment questions/observations 




within a larger evaluation of several household and village assessment components. This con- 
cealment was aided by the fact that, as in other LMICs, non-government organizations 
(NGOs), the government, and UN agencies, as well as research programmes like MRC Gam- 
bia, had concurrent interventions and initiatives, surveillance sites, and studies in CRR, result- 
ing in numerous posters, visits, and surveys in villages for mothers and children [38]. Even if 
there were posters or signs related to complementary-food safety and hygiene, these would 
have been among other intervention activity posters and banners related to other government, 
NGO, or UN agency programmes, making it difficult for data collectors to link the survey and 
observations to the complementary-food intervention. Moreover, studies using direct observa- 
tion to assess handwashing interventions in India [19] have shown that differential reactivity 
and observation are minimal if participants and assessors make no direct link between inter- 
vention and assessment. 

in reporting was minimised, but limited resources prevented this. Child inpatient reports by 
mothers could not be confirmed due to poor hospital record systems in The Gambia. How- 
ever, routine, unenhanced clinic data from other studies support our trial findings [22]. There- 
fore, we assessed internal and external validity and the overall risk of bias by comparing health 
outcomes (reported diarrhoea) with (1) objective microbiological outcomes at 6-month fol- 
low-up; (2) retrospectively collected clinic data [22]; (3) other environmental outcomes (soap 
availability in the kitchen and toilet area); (4) observed mothers’ water and complementary- 
food safety and hygiene behaviours; (5) mothers’ family-food safety and hygiene behaviours 
(at 32 months; manuscript in preparation); (6) intermediate process outcomes such as num- 
bers of pledged mothers (MaaFamboos), sustained mothers (MaaSawars), and those achieving 
role-model status (MaaChampions); and (7) qualitative data at 32 months (manuscript in 
preparation). In our study, triangulation of all these results demonstrates the internal validity 
of our conclusions and indicates that the statistically significant difference we detected at 6 and 
32 months was likely to be real and not due to bias or chance. 
A limitation affecting the generalisability of our findings is that non-PHC villages, i.e., vil- 
lages without a trained TBA and male VHWs, were not included. However, in practice, as the 
older mother volunteers (MaaSupervisors) were chosen by communities, they were not always 
the trained TBAs, and therefore, our results were not dependent on the training of TBAs and 
VHWs at PHC villages. Hence, we anticipate that this intervention could be readily imple- 
mented in non-PHC villages without previously trained lay people, particularly as baseline 
characteristics indicate that our villages were typical of The Gambia’s CRR [39]. Although this 
intervention is likely to be relevant to other such village settings prevalent in The Gambia, 
Africa, and possibly other LMICs, caution should be exercised in making conclusions about 
generalisability as the intervention requires testing in more diverse settings (different-sized vil- 
lages, different countries, and/or urban/peri-urban settings). 
Post hoc plans, and therefore a small sample size for 32-month follow-up, are less than opti- 
mal; however, we registered the 32-month follow-up before data collection and used very simi- 
lar methods to the 6-month follow-up. Lack of laboratory data at 32 months is a weakness as 
lab tests link our health outcomes to the causal pathway of diarrhoeal diseases. However, as 
with the Mali, Bangladesh, and Nepal studies [10,20,27], at 6 months we demonstrate that 
practicing the behaviours reduced food contamination. Data on general diet or breastfeeding, 
which could influence children’s nutritional status, were not collected as nutritional status was 
not an outcome of this trial. Nonetheless, our RCT design, with balanced cluster and child/ 
family characteristics [8], implies that dietary diversity and breastfeeding rates would likely 
also be balanced in the arms of the trial. Breastfeeding in CRR was prevalent, with the ‘ever 




breastfeeding’ rate at 98%, and 65% still breastfeeding at 6–24 months (93% breastfed at 1 
year) [13]. 
In conclusion, we address WHO estimates that indicate a considerable global burden of 
FBDs, particularly affecting children <5 years of age living in LMICs. Rates of disease are high- 
est in children aged 6–24 months, when complementary feeding is practiced. The WHO esti- 
mates of the FBD burden highlight the need for innovative interventions on improved food 
safety to specifically prevent infections in children of complementary-feeding age. This study 
describes such a strategy. This theoretically based, culturally embedded community-level com- 
plementary-food intervention was acceptable to villagers and engaged a variety of community 
members. Mothers and community volunteers adopted the behaviours and promoted them to 
new mothers over the longer follow-up period (beyond 2 years) without further programmatic 
input. The intervention was effective in changing mothers’ behaviour, reducing E. coli growths 
in complementary food and water, reported diarrhoea rates and admissions, and respiratory 
illness. As the differences were mainly still significant in the longer term, and both cooking of 
child food and diarrhoea in children are common in households in LMICs at the population 
level, the intervention is likely to have an important impact on child outcomes. For implemen- 
tation, an annual reminder visit to the villages (as per our 5-month visit) or media activities 
may further improve the sustained effects of the programme. Our theory-based intervention 
shared significant elements with Asian interventions, indicating transferability of theory and 
tools across cultures. The active involvement of policy makers and public health service pro- 
viders, traditional performing artists, and village authorities also contributed to a low-cost 
intervention programme that potentially could be successfully scaled. 
There is a clear case for larger longer-term trials with health as a primary outcome, studies 
in different settings, and at-scale implementation studies. Such low-cost culturally embedded 
complementary-food safety and hygiene behaviour interventions could be a necessary compo- 
nent of diarrhoea prevention strategies, and the culturally embedded performing arts commu- 
nity interventions could be adapted for other behaviour change objectives.
