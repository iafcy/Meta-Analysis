Despite the tremendous achievement in reducing child mortality and morbidity in the last two decades, diar- 
rhoea is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children in many developing countries, including 
Ethiopia. Hand washing with soap promotion, water quality improvements and improvements in excreta dispos- 
al signiﬁcantly reduces diarrhoeal diseases. 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of hand washing with soap and water, sanitation and hy- 
giene (WASH) educational Intervention on the incidence of under-ﬁve children diarrhoea. A community-based 
cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 24 clusters (sub-Kebelles) in Jigjiga district, Somali region, 
Eastern Ethiopia from February 1 to July 30, 2015. The trial compared incidence of diarrhoea among under-ﬁve 
children whose primary caretakers receive hand washing with soap and water, sanitation, hygiene educational 
messages with control households. Generalized estimating equation with a log link function Poisson distribution 
family was used to compute adjusted incidence rate ratio and the corresponding 95% conﬁdence interval. 
The results of this study show that the longitudinal adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of diarrhoeal diseases com- 
paring interventional and control households was 0.65 (95% CI 0.57, 0.73) suggesting an overall diarrhoeal dis- 
eases reduction of 35%. The results are similar to other trials of WASH educational interventions and hand 
washing with soap. 
In conclusion, hand washing with soap practice during critical times and WASH educational messages reduces 
childhood diarrhoea in the rural pastoralist area.

The deadline of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) has just 
expired in 2015. The target for MDG 4 was to reduce the under-5 mor- 
tality rate by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. This goal called for 
two-thirds reduction in mortality in children younger than ﬁve years 
between 1990 and 2015 (UN, 2000). 
Since then, between 1990 and 2012, worldwide mortality in chil- 
dren younger than 5 years has declined by 47%, from an estimated 
rate of 90 deaths per 1000 live births to 48 deaths per 1000 live births. 
This translates into 17,000 fewer children dying every day in 2012 
than in 1990 (WHO, 2015). The 2014 report of the United Nations 
Inter-Agency Group for mortality estimated that under-ﬁve mortality 



decreased by 69% from 205 deaths per 1000 live births in 1990 to 64 
in 2013, outpacing the MDG 4 target of a two-thirds reduction 
(Alkema et al., 2014). 
In Ethiopia between 2000 and 2016 under-ﬁve children mortality 
have decreased remarkably by 60% from an estimated rate of 166 to 
67 deaths per 1000 live births (CSA and ICF, 2016). 
However, mortality rates for children under-ﬁve remains high. Re- 
cent evidence showed that 6.3 million children died before age 5 years 
in 2013. Among these, 51.8% (3.257 million) died of infectious causes. 
If present trends continue, 4.4 million children younger than 5 years 
will die in 2030. Furthermore, sub-Saharan Africa will have 33% of the 
births and 60% of the deaths in 2030, compared with 25% and 50% in 
2013 respectively (Liu et al., 2015). In Ethiopia, despite the sharp de- 
crease in under-ﬁve mortality, regional variation exist within the coun- 
try and Somali region has under-ﬁve mortality of 122 deaths per 1000 
live births (CSA, 2012). 
Infectious diseases reductions signiﬁcantly reduce childhood deaths. 
Reductions in pneumonia, diarrhoea, and measles collectively were

responsible for half of the 3.6 million fewer deaths recorded in 2013 ver- 
sus 2000 (Liu et al., 2015). 
selected for the study because of acute watery diarrhoea outbreaks as 
reported by the Regional Health Bureau. 
Childhood diarrhoea is the third leading cause of mortality in low in- 
come countries including Ethiopia, causing an estimated 1.4 million 
deaths in 2012 (WHO, 2015; Forouzanfar et al., 2015). Young children 
are especially vulnerable, with diarrhoea accounting more than one 
quarter of all deaths in children aged under-ﬁve years in Africa and 
South East Asia (Murray et al., 2013; Lanata et al., 2013; Walker et al., 
2013; Boschi-Pinto et al., 2008). 
Diarrhoeal disease risk reductions of 48%, 17% and 36% is associated 
respectively with hand washing promotion, water quality improve- 
ments and improvements in excreta disposal (Cairncross et al., 2010). 
WASH interventions averted 13% of childhood deaths in Ethiopia in 
2011 (Doherty et al., 2016). 
Water from improved source isn't always safe (WHO, 2012) and 
may be contaminated with pathogens during transportation and stor- 
age (WHO, 2007). Estimates of the health impact of WASH interven- 
tions on under-ﬁve children are derived from interventions that 
promote or improve domestic services and practices in the environment 
(Cairncross et al., 2010). 
Moreover, hand washing with soap can reduce micro-organism level 
close to zero and can interrupt the transmission of faecal-oral microbes 
in the domestic environment (Kampf and Kramer, 2004; Sprunt et al., 
1973) mainly through the mechanics of rubbing and rinsing (Sprunt 
et al., 1973; Lowbury et al., 1964). 
The effect of hand washing with soap practices and WASH educa- 
tional interventions on childhood diarrhoea in the rural settings of the 
Sub-Saharan Africa remains unexplored, although it was done in Asia 
three decades ago (Stanton and Clemens, 1987). Interventional studies 
have covered the transfer of knowledge about proper hygiene but 
from school settings (Bowen et al., 2007; Blanton et al., 2010; 
Dreibelbis et al., 2014). 
We evaluated the effect of hand washing with soap practice and 
WASH educational intervention on childhood diarrhoeal diseases inci- 
dence in the rural pastoralist community settings of Somali region, East- 
ern Ethiopia. 


The study protocols have been reviewed and approved by the Jigjiga 
University ethical review committee. Study consent was obtained from 
district administration, district health ofﬁce and community leaders. 
Control clusters in the sub-Kebelle have received free books and pencils 
to support their children's education during the study period and after 
completion of the study, they were given the same health education ses- 
sions used in this study. Written consent was taken from the primary 
caretakers of the children. 

The current study was conducted in the rural areas of Jigjiga district 
of Ethiopian-Somali Regional State (ESRS) in the Eastern Ethiopia from 
February 1 to July 30, 2015. The ESRS is one of the nine regional states 
that constitute the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. Pastoralism 
is a way of life whereby the livelihood of the people depends on raising 
livestock and living on its milk and meat (Montavon et al., 2013). Nearly 
90% of the population in ESRS resides in rural areas, leading either a pas- 
toralist or agro-pastoralist lifestyle. Jigjiga district is one of the 68 dis- 
tricts of the region, part of Fafan zone, with a total population of 
277,560 according to 2007 census conducted by the central statistical 
agency of Ethiopia of whom 149,292 are men and 128,268 women. A 
total of 34 Kebele is found in the district of which 4 are urban and 30 
are rural Kebele in the Woreda (Fig. 1). Finally Jigjiga district was 

The sample was calculated by using methods published by 
Hayes and Bennett (1999). A recent study conducted in Eastern Ethiopia 
indicated disease rates for incidence of child diarrhoea among 
home based chlorine treatment intervention group of 4.5 episodes/ 
100 person week observations (Mengistie et al., 2013). Using this 
incidence, along with 80% power and 95% conﬁdence interval, we ran- 
domly selected a ﬁnal sample of 24 clusters (12 for the intervention 
group and 12 for the control group) with 50 children of under-ﬁve in 
each cluster. 

A community-based cluster randomized controlled trial was 
employed. The study groups were divided into two: clusters that re- 
ceived intervention and control clusters. Only rural communities of 
the district were selected for the study. A household was considered el- 
igible for the study if the following criteria are met: a) at least one child 
aged 1–59 months living in the home and b) not a model health exten- 
sion household. Households that successfully implement all compo- 
nents of the 16 packages of the Health Extension Program (HEP) 
are ofﬁcially certiﬁed as a Model Health Extension Household 
(Teklehaimanot et al., 2007). This trial excludes all model Health Exten- 
sion households to avoid biases due to a competing intervention. 

Kebelle is the smallest administrative unit in Ethiopia consisting of at 
least 500 households, or the equivalent of 3500 to 4000 persons (FMOH, 
2007). The Kebelle is further divided into sub-Kebelles (neighbourhood 
villages). A Final count of 14 Kebelle was eligible for the study. These el- 
igible Kebelles for the study located north and south of Jigjiga City i.e., 5 
North (22 sub-Kebelles) and 9 South (34 sub-Kebelles). Eligible 
Kebelles in the north and south were assigned randomly to intervention 
and control groups respectively by using lottery method in the presence 
of community leaders, Kebele heads and representative from the district 
health ofﬁce and Regional Health Bureau to avoid study contamination 
by geographically separating the region of the intervention from 
the control region. Twenty-four Sub-Kebelles were then randomly se- 
lected from the 56 total sub-Kebelles by using simple randomization 
(computer generated numbers). From 22 sub-Kebelles, 12 were 
selected randomly and assigned to the Intervention group. From 34 
sub-Kebelles, 12 were selected randomly and assigned to the control 
group (Fig. 2). 
Neither the community (both control and intervention group) nor 
the ﬁeld workers knew the intervention purpose. The follow up study 
started on February 1, 2015 and ended July 30, 2015. 

Twelve sessions of health education on key WASH messages and 
demonstration of hand washing with soap were given to all of the inter- 
vention clusters by clinical nurse professionals (ﬁeld workers) who 
have taken training for 10 days. Primary care takers of the children in 
the households were instructed to keep their water storage container 
clean and covered, to have a latrine and utilize properly, and to wash 
their hands and children's hands ideally with soap after defecation, be- 
fore meal preparation and eating. 
The ﬁeld workers arranged cluster (Sub-Kebelle) meetings for each 
cluster to illustrate the pamphlets, show health problems resulting 
from hand and water contamination and showed speciﬁc instruction 
on how to use the intervention assigned to the cluster. Intervention 



happened every 2 weeks in a period of 6 months follow up. Each inter- 
vention took up to 3-hour time from 4:00 pm to 7:00 pm local time 
since most village residents were available in late afternoon. 
All households in the intervention clusters received a package of 
health education messages and soap (white bars). The ﬁeld workers 
demonstrated by face to face approach how to wet their hands, lather 
them completely with soap, and rub together for 1 min. The other key 
messages were provided by using loudspeaker (Megaphone) at one 
time in each visit at the respective cluster location. 
Primary care takers of the control group continued their way of hand 
washing practices, disposal of water storage behaviour and latrine san- 
itation. After the completion of the study they were given the same ed- 
ucational intervention used in this study. Table 1 illustrates key 
messages and interventions used in this study. 

The primary outcome was longitudinal incidence of diarrhoea. In 
this study diarrhoea is deﬁned as the passage of three or more liquid 
or semi-liquid stools in a 24-hour period or the passage of at least one 
liquid or semi-liquid stool with blood or mucus (Baqui et al., 1991). 
This deﬁnition of diarrhoea was being instructed to the primary care 
takers by the data collectors. Primary care takers were also instructed 
to follow the child and report diarrhoea in the previous two weeks. 
Twenty-four data collectors (ﬁeld workers) visited intervention and 
control households in every 2 weeks period (12 visits). At each visit, oc- 
currence of diarrhoea (episodes of diarrhoea) over the previous two 
weeks was recorded by the data collectors for all under-ﬁve children 
based on the primary care taker report.

The secondary outcome was bacteriological quality of drinking 
water at household level. Water samples (100 ml) were collected 
from all households' drinking water storage container by asking the pri- 
mary care takers to provide water from the containers for the re- 
searchers. The guideline of WHO for drinking water quality 
assessment was used as a method of water sample collection at each 
household (WHO, 2004). The collected water samples from each source 
was labelled and kept in icebox during transportation and analysed in 
the laboratory. All collected samples were analysed for the presence of 
faecal coliform. 
A baseline survey was conducted on primary care takers, children, 
environmental characteristics and pre-intervention diarrhoea preva- 
lence rates by using questionnaire. 

The data was cross checked by the ﬁeld supervisors on a visit basis. 
Prior to data entry, base line and follow up visit data forms were 
checked for completeness and consistence. Data was double entered 
on to EPI data Version 3.5.3 and statistical analysis was performed by 
using SPSS version 20. Intention-to-treat analysis was used to compare 
the incidence of diarrhoea among under-ﬁve children between inter- 
vention and control arms. 
The baseline data was analysed and compared among the interven- 
tion and control group. The rate of diarrhoea (per 100 person-weeks) in 
children under-ﬁve years of age was measured for the intervention and 
control communities. Generalized estimating equation (Zeger and 
Liang, 1986) with log link Poisson distribution family was used to com- 
pute adjusted incidence rate ratio and the corresponding 95% conﬁ- 
dence interval of the dependent variable (longitudinal incidence of 
diarrhoea) and co-variates. For the water quality, water samples were 
analysed for the presence of faecal coliforms and compared among the 
intervention and control communities. 


At baseline assessment 612 households were interviewed in January 
15–25, 2015. The household, primary care takers, children and environ- 
mental characteristics were generally similar across intervention and 
control households and well balanced. The number of households and 
children per cluster were 25 and 50 respectively. The mean age of the 
mothers/caretakers was 28.5 for the intervention group and 29.7 for 
the control group and for the children 21.3 and 21.5 months in the inter- 
vention and control respectively. Pre-intervention two week diarrhoea 
prevalence was 26.5% for the control households and 23.2% for the inter- 
vention households (Table 2)). 

The incidence of diarrhoea was signiﬁcantly lower among under- 
ﬁve children from the intervention households. From the control arm 
905 occurrences (episodes) of diarrhoea (6.3 episodes per 100 person- 
weeks observation) were reported. Intervention households reported 
594 episodes (4.1 episodes per 100 person-weeks observation) 
(Table 3).

Sharp decrease of diarrhoea episodes per week among intervention 
households was observed during the course of this study. Fig. 3 shows 
the number of diarrhoea occurrence and the visit week. 
In both interventional and control households, in the follow up dura- 
tion, the longitudinal episodes of diarrhoea was higher in children b - 
12 months. The reduction of diarrhoea episodes for all age group in 
the follow up duration between the control and intervention house- 
holds is shown in Fig. 4. 

Generalized estimating equation using log link function was used to 
control confounding factors that might have contributed to the inci- 
dence of diarrhoeal diseases. Socio-demographic characteristics, child, 
maternal factors and WASH related factors were checked if there is an 
association with the incidence of diarrhoea. The result shows that only 
the intervention contributes to the reduction of diarrhoea in the study 
area. See Table 5. 

There is a signiﬁcant difference between the intervention and con- 
trol households in the base-line and end-line water contamination. At 
base-line nearly 31% of the water was contaminated from the interven- 
tion households but in the end line assessment only 11% were contam- 
inated from the intervention households (Table 4). 

The study assessed effect of hand washing with soap and WASH ed- 
ucational interventions on the incidence of childhood diarrhoea in the 
rural settings of Somali region. The study shown 35% reduction (RR = 
0.65; 95% CI 0.57,0.73) in diarrhoeal diseases for households who

practiced hand washing with soap and the WASH key messages com- 
pared to control households that were given no intervention. The result 
of the study is supporting one another. When exposure of continuous 
health education session was given consistently in six months period, 
longitudinal incidence of under-ﬁve children diarrhoea has decreased 
by 35%. 
The importance of WASH educational interventions is stressed by re- 
ports that show that improvements in water supply in terms of quantity 
and quality and physical facilities for excreta disposal without adequate 
behavioural change among the target community alone would not 
change the prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases (Brown et al., 2013). 
Although our study didn't compare effect of each intervention on the 
overall reduction, we believe that the WASH educational messages also 
led to behavioural changes among the target group which together re- 
duced diarrhoeal diseases. Our result suggests the assumption that it 
was those combinations of hand washing with soap and key health ed- 
ucation on WASH factors that reduced the incidence of diarrhoea on a

weekly base as ﬁeld workers continue visiting and instructing interven- 
tion households. 
The result was consistent with other similar studies interventional 
study done on the subject WASH interventions (Blanton et al., 2010; 
Bowen et al., 2007; Luby et al., 2005; Luby et al., 2006; Freeman et al., 
2012; Han and Hlaing, 1989; Aiello et al., 2008). 
Limitation of this study includes randomization at the Sub-Kebelle 
level which resulted in a small number of clusters but the result can 
still be compared to other studies of WASH education and hand washing 
interventions.
