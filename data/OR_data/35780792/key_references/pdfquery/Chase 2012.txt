Handwashing with soap, which has been shown to reduce 
diarrhea in young children by as much as 48 percent, is 
frequently mentioned as one of the most effective and 
inexpensive ways to save children’s lives. Yet rates of 
handwashing remain very low throughout the world. 
Handwashing with soap campaigns are de rigueur in 
developing countries, but little is known about their 
effectiveness. Few have been rigorously evaluated, and 
none on a large-scale. This paper evaluates a large-scale 
handwashing campaign in three provinces of Vietnam 
in 2010. Exposure to the campaign resulted in a slight 
increase in the availability of handwashing materials in 
the household, and caregivers in the treatment group 
were more likely to report washing hands at some of the 
times emphasized by the campaign. However, observed 
handwashing with soap at these times is low, and there 
isn’t any difference between the treatment and control 
groups. As a result, no impact on health or productivity 
is found. These results suggest that even under seemingly 
optimal conditions, where knowledge and access to soap 
and water are not main constraints, behavior change 
campaigns that take place on a large scale face tradeoffs in 
terms of intensity and effectiveness.

Inequality Team, Development Research Group. It is part of a larger effort by the World Bank to provide open access to 
its research and make a contribution to development policy discussions around the world. Policy Research Working Papers

1-day events in each treatment community. Due to difficulty of finding qualified firms and the limited scale of the DCC 
interventions the DCC activities were never carried out. This component was thus dropped from the study.

should it be taken to represent the communes and districts where the HWIPC campaign took place. 13 












9 A direct consumer contact (DCC) component of the intervention was dropped during the implementation stage but these 
communes were maintained in the study 
10 The remaining 191 communes were not part of the evaluation sample and did not receive the IPC project interventions, but 
were exposed to the national and regional level TV ad campaign.

12 Random assignment of treatment, whereby a statistically random selection of communities receives the treatment and the 
remainder serve as controls, gives us a robust counterfactual to measure the causal effect of the HWIPC intervention. The 
randomization process ensures that on average the treatment and comparison groups are equal in both observed and unobserved 
characteristics, (Hernan, et al., 2004) and that an appropriate counterfactual can be measured.

Exposure to these channels and messages was measured midway through the campaign by asking primary 
caregivers whether they remember seeing or hearing anything about handwashing in the past month. 23 









22 Given underreporting of child health symptoms at baseline difference-in-difference estimates are not presented for child health 
outcomes 
23 The exposure module asked about activities that took place over the previous month. A one month recall period was used in 
order to balance recall bias with targeting to the intervention. All activities were underway during the month prior to the midterm 
survey. Exposure was measured at the endline survey as well, however since the question asked about exposure in the past month 
and the intervention had ended more than three months before endline, these results are not analysed here.

effective handwashing using the FOAM framework. Behavioral determinants such as locus of control, 
beliefs and access/availability were measured in the target population using a series of Likert scale25 
statements, and the behavioral constructs tracked over time to see how they respond to the program.26 






















25 A Likert scale evaluates a series of statements in which the respondent is asked to provide their level of agreement / 
disagreement with the statement. In this study the following levels were used: strongly disagree, disagree, agree, strongly agree. 
The statements administered did not provide an option for „neither agree nor disagree‟, however respondents could provide the 
response „Don‟t Know‟ 
26 Factor analysis of the Likert scale was unable to reveal a robust underlying construct for any of the behavioral determinants, so 
only individual statements are analysed here. See (Hernandez, 2012) for discussion of the analysis of behavioral determinants in 
Vietnam.
