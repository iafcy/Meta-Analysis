objectives To evaluate how an intervention, which combined hand washing promotion aimed at 5- 
year-olds with provision of free soap, affected illnesses among the children and their families and 
children’s school absenteeism. 
methods We monitored illnesses, including diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs), 
school absences and soap consumption for 41 weeks in 70 low-income communities in Mumbai, 
India (35 communities per arm). 
results Outcomes from 847 intervention households (containing 847 5-year-olds and 4863 subjects 
in total) and 833 control households (containing 833 5-year-olds and 4812 subjects) were modelled 
using negative binomial regression. Intervention group 5-year-olds had fewer episodes of diarrhoea 
((cid:1)25%, 95% conﬁdence intervals [CI] = (cid:1)37%, (cid:1)2%), ARIs ((cid:1)15%, 95% CI = (cid:1)30%, (cid:1)8%), 
school absences due to illnesses ((cid:1)27%, 95% CI = (cid:1)41%, (cid:1)18%) and eye infections ((cid:1)46%, 95% 
CI = (cid:1)58%, (cid:1)31%). Further, there were fewer episodes of diarrhoea and ARIs in the intervention 
group for ‘whole families’ ((cid:1)31%, 95% CI = (cid:1)37%, (cid:1)5%; and (cid:1)14%, 95% CI = (cid:1)23%, (cid:1)6%, 
respectively), 6- to 15-year-olds ((cid:1)30%, 95% CI = (cid:1)39%, (cid:1)7%; and (cid:1)15%, 95% CI = (cid:1)24%, 
(cid:1)6%) and under 5 s ((cid:1)32%, 95% CI = (cid:1)41%, (cid:1)4%; and (cid:1)20%, 95% CI = (cid:1)29%, (cid:1)8%). 
conclusions Direct-contact hand washing interventions aimed at younger school-aged children can 
affect the health of the whole family. These may be scalable through public–private partnerships and 
classroom-based campaigns. Further work is required to understand the conditions under which 
health beneﬁts are transferred and the mechanisms for transference. 


There is considerable evidence that hand washing with 
soap (HWWS) reduces the incidence of diarrhoeal disease 
(Curtis & Cairncross 2003; Aiello et al. 2008; Ejemot- 
Nwadiaro et al. 2012), respiratory infections (Rabie & 
Curtis 2006; Aiello et al. 2008; Cowling et al. 2009) and 
skin infections (Luby et al. 2005; Bloomﬁeld et al. 2007). 
Additionally, associations have been seen between 
HWWS and reductions in worm infections (Bieri et al. 
2013), eye infections (Montessori et al. 1998) and school 
absences (Bowen et al. 2007; O’Reilly et al. 2008). 
The effects of hand washing interventions may extend 
beyond the individual exposed. HWWS among carers can 
reduce mortality among neonates (Manandhar et al. 
2004; Rhee et al. 2008) and morbidity in young children 
unable to wash their own hands (Luby et al. 2004). 
Our objective was to evaluate the effects of a hand 
washing intervention designed to optimise the possibility 
of observing broader effects on household members. 
5-year-old children were the principal target because they 
are responsive to hand washing behaviour change mes- 
sages (O’Reilly et al. 2008) and may be effective ‘change 
agents’ within the family (Alibhai & Ahmad 2001; Tobin 
& Van Koppen 2005; O’Reilly et al. 2008). Further, we 
involved the mother in the promotion in an attempt to 
encourage the child and to optimise transfer between 
family members. 






intervention would reduce episodes of diarrhoea, ARIs 
and school absences; while for the ‘whole family’, there 
would be reductions in diarrhoea and ARIs. We also 
investigated effects on other illnesses that may be affected 
by changes in HWWS. 

This was a cluster randomised controlled study with one 
community in each of 35 matched pairs randomly allo- 
cated to intervention and one to control. For each com- 
munity, we aimed to start 30 households containing one 
‘target’ child in the ﬁrst standard of a municipal school. 
Children were typically aged 5, although a minority were 
6 or 7 years old. 

The study was located in low-income urban communities 
in west and south Mumbai. There was an average of six 
people in households which, typically, consisted of a 
single room without a water supply or sanitation. The 
vast majority had an income of less than US$60 a month 
(Table 2). Soap was widely available in local shops. 

Locally recruited ﬁeldworkers were briefed to identify 
and characterise communities that were geographically 
distinct; a community being a set of households that were 
close together with a common leadership. 187 communi- 
ties were characterised according to size (small, medium 
or large), location (west or south Mumbai), predominant 
language (Hindi, Marathi or Gujarati), most common 
work location (home or away from home) and kind of 
housing (temporary or permanent). Thirty ﬁve matched 
community pairs were created by, ﬁrst, sorting communi- 
ties into pools according to size. A total of 67 were small 
(<1000 households), 94 medium sized (1000–5000 house- 
holds) and 26 large (>5000 households). A community 
was selected at random from a pool and matched with 
another from that pool according to location, language, 
work location and housing. Nine community pairs were 
small (26%), 21 medium sized (60%) and ﬁve large 
(14%). A coin toss was used to assign one community in 
each pair to intervention and one to control. 

method, whereby ﬁeldworkers located the ﬁrst household 
in a community on an ad hoc basis and further house- 
holds through verbal references. In parallel, supervisor 
visits identiﬁed errors in the initial characterisations (on 
four occasions there were geographical overlaps between 
intervention and control communities, and once a com- 
munity had been incorrectly characterised). These ﬁve 
communities were replaced by comparable communities 
drawn from the main pool, together with one further 
community where very low literacy levels would have 
prevented successful participation in the study. 

sent forms appropriate to condition were read to resi- 
dents old enough to understand and were signed by all 
occupants aged 9 years or older. During consenting, ﬁeld- 
workers expressed safety concerns when visiting two 
intervention communities and these were also replaced. 
No data were collected from these or any of the other 
replaced communities. 

This involved the provision of free soap and a social mar- 
keting programme (Sidibe et al. 2009) both carrying Life- 
buoy branding. The 41 week programme was designed 
according to behaviour change principles (Claessen et al. 
2008) and aimed to educate, motivate and reward chil- 
dren for HWWS after defecation, before each of three 
meals and during bathing. The help of the mother was 
enlisted through home visits, parents’ evenings and estab- 
lishment of a ‘Good Mums’ club. 
During the ﬁrst 17 weeks we introduced each of the 
individual hand washing occasions and created awareness 
of germs, how they are spread and their role in illness 
(but not speciﬁcally diarrhoea or ARIs). We also chal- 
lenged the belief that if hands look clean they are free of 
germs and emphasised the importance of soap in 
removing germs. 

single idea around ﬁve key hand washing occasions. 
Children were asked to hand wash at home on these 
occasions for 10 consecutive days supported by environ- 
mental cues to help them remember (e.g. wall hangers, 
danglers) and by small rewards handed out by their 
mother (e.g. stickers, coins, toy animals). Children were 
also encouraged to advocate HWWS within their families 
before shared evening meals. 

child and mother (Perkins 2003), used the fear of con- 
tamination and disgust (Curtis & Biran 2001), and cre- 
ated peer pressure (Sidibe 2003). Children and mothers 
were asked to pledge in front of peers; children commit- 
ted to HWWS and mothers committed to help the child. 
The programme was delivered by a dedicated team of 
‘promoters’ primarily through a series of weekly 
‘classrooms’ and ‘home visits’. ‘Classrooms’ were held in 





community buildings after school, during which the 
5-year-olds were taught through songs, poems and sto- 
ries. During ‘home visits’, ‘promoters’ covered the same 
topics with mothers to those in the classroom, gave 
mothers assignments for the child and provided materials 
to use as reminders and/or rewards for hand washing. 
Mothers were also asked to provide hand washing tips 
for other mothers to use with their children. 

morale, build a network of mothers and run the ‘Best 
Mums’ competition. ‘Best Mums’ received certiﬁcates for 
high levels of compliance, completing assignments and 
decorating children’s folders. Soap was supplied to 
intervention households as wrapped 90-g Lifebuoy bars. 
Initially, households were given ﬁve bars, which were 
replenished on production of empty wrappers during data 
collection visits. 

its’. Unless by prior arrangement, 3-week gaps in either 
register triggered supervisors to ask families to resume or 
be withdrawn from the study. We monitored whether 
soaps were being sold on the open market through mark- 
ing soap wrappers with unique identiﬁers and performing 
twice-weekly checks in local shops. 
The control group continued normal hand washing 
practices throughout the trial. Once a month, all target 
children received a gift to the value of 50 Rupees 
(approximately US$1). 

The main period of data collection began on 22 
October 2007 and ran concurrently with the 
intervention for 41 weeks until 2 August 2008. 
Households were visited twice a week, spaced three or 
4 days apart. Only one visit was made during weeks 3, 
10, 14, 21 and 27 (due to public holidays) and week 
17 (due to civil unrest). Individual households were 
also allowed to take pre-arranged ‘breaks’ (e.g. due to 
family holidays). 

absences were completed solely through interviews, usu- 
ally with primary caregivers. Illness questions covered the 
main health outcomes of diarrhoea and ARIs, as well as 
illnesses that might be affected by hand washing and 
could be recorded by data collectors without formal med- 
ical training (eye infections, vomiting, abscesses or boils, 
headaches and earaches). 
Data collectors asked whether anyone in the house- 
hold had suffered from each of the illnesses since the 
last visit. In case of positive responses, data collectors 
asked who had been ill and on which days. 
Interviewees were also asked whether the target child 
had been absent from school and, if so, the number of 
absent days and the reason (‘child illness’, ‘illness of 
another family member’, or ‘other’). 
Operational deﬁnitions for all the illnesses were 
taken from Black’s Medical Dictionary (MacPherson 
1999). Diarrhoea was deﬁned as ‘Three or more loose 
or watery stools in a 24-h period.’ and ARIs as 
‘Pneumonia, cough, fever, chest pain and shortness of 
breath, cold, inﬂammation of any or all of the 
airways, that is, nose, sinuses, throat, larynx, trachea 
and bronchi’. 
Soap wrappers were collected and used as a soap 
consumption measure and as an indirect measure of 
hand washing behaviour. We planned to use ‘soap 
acceleration sensors’ (Ram et al. 2010) as a direct mea- 
sure of behaviour with a subset of households. How- 
ever, technical difﬁculties prevented us from doing this 
successfully. Compliance with data collection was 
encouraged through supervisors’ visits. These were trig- 
gered when households missed 3-weeks data collection 
without prior arrangement. Households were removed 
from the study if they provided no data for ﬁve con- 
secutive weeks. 
The reliability of data recording was monitored by 
supervisors, who visited each household approximately 
every 2 months. Additional checks were made when data 
collectors reported low success rates in contacting fami- 
lies. Demographic data were collected during initial con- 
senting and covered household composition, wealth 
indicators, and access to water and sanitation. 
Data collectors were recruited locally and trained on 
identiﬁcation of illnesses during a 1-day training session 
led by the study doctor. Data collectors were independent 
of the behaviour change intervention. Each was assigned, 
exclusively, either to households in the intervention group 
or to control households. 

We calculated the number of communities required to 
detect a between-group difference in diarrhoea incidence 
density for the 5-year-olds. We used Luby’s data, col- 
lected from similar communities in Pakistan (Luby et al. 
2004) to estimate a diarrhoea incidence of four episodes 
per 100 person weeks (SD = 1.4) in the control group. 
We calculated that we needed 64 communities (32 com- 
munities per group) to detect a difference of 25% in diar- 
rhoea incidence at the 5% signiﬁcance level (2-tailed) 
with a power of 80%. We recruited 35 communities per 
group because we anticipated a potential 10% attrition 
in communities during data collection. 







Main outcomes were episodes of diarrhoea, ARIs and 
school absences among target children, and episodes of 
diarrhoea and ARIs among their families. Secondary 
outcomes were episodes of eye infections, vomiting, 
abscesses or boils, headaches, and earaches. 
We considered that subjects had only ‘completed’ the 
intervention if they remained on the study until the end. 
Therefore, the main analyses presented are ‘per-protocol’ 
based on ‘completers’. 5-year-olds were treated as complet- 
ers if they stayed on the study for all 41 weeks. Other fam- 
ily members’ data were analysed when both they and their 
5-year-olds completed 41 weeks. To check for biases in the 
data caused by dropouts, we also report ‘intention-to-treat’ 
analyses which included all collected data. 
Illness and school absence incidences were calculated 
at a community level. Diarrhoea and ARIs are reported 
for ‘whole families’ (combined children and adults), and 
three independent child subgroups: target children (pri- 
mary objective), non-target children aged 5 and under 
(born after 2001), non-target children aged 6–15 (chil- 
dren born between 1992 and 2001, inclusive). For school 
absences, we only collected data for target children. 
With the exception of ARIs, subjects were considered 
‘at risk’ if they had not reported suffering from an illness 
for three consecutive days. For ARIs, this ‘clearance’ per- 
iod was set to 5 days. The maximum number of ‘at-risk’ 
days was 286 days for illnesses and 192 for school 
absences (the maximum number of days that a child 
could have attended school). 
For each outcome, the total number of episodes was 
modelled using negative binomial regression, ﬁtting the 
treatment and the pairing as covariates and the logarithm 
of the total number of at-risk days in study as an offset. 
Negative binomial regression is Poisson regression but with 
an additional term to allow for over-dispersion (Lawless 
1987; McCullagh & Nelder 1989). The predicted relative 
risk reduction (RRR) was calculated using the equation 
‘RRR = 100 * {(RI/RC)–1}’, where RI and RC are the event 
rates in the intervention and control groups, respectively. 
In negative binomial regression analyses, the RRR is esti- 
mated from the model coefﬁcient of the treatment group 
(bgroup) by the formula RRR = 100 * {bgroup – 1}.

by the Hindustan Unilever Research Ethics Committee. 
As Figure 1 shows, of 1026 target children that started 
each treatment, 179 (17%) in the intervention group and 
191 (19%) in control were not entered into the ‘per-pro- 
tocol’ analysis. The majority of non-completion was due 
to families either leaving the area or refusing to partici- 
pate, 165/179 (92%) for intervention and 182/191 (95%) 
for control. 
Table 1 shows the number of participants starting 
treatments and the number entered into the per-protocol 
analyses for the various subgroups. For a per-protocol 
analysis, there may be a concern that the dropouts were 
uneven across the groups. However, data from the base- 
line survey show that the two groups of completers were 
well matched, although there were some small differences 
in the access to sanitation (Table 2). 
Overall, there were 73 086 (93.5%) successful data 
collection visits in the intervention group compared with 
72 484 (92.5%) in control. For the completers, there 
were 2 591 936 observation days for all subjects and 
445 726 for the target 5-year-olds. The mean number of 
observation days per subject was well matched between 
groups for all subjects (intervention = 268.0 days, con- 
trol = 267.8 days) and for target 5-year-olds (interven- 
tion = 265.2 days, control = 265.4 days). There was a 
possible maximum of 303 408 days for school atten- 
dance, with both groups having a mean of 180.6 poten- 
tial school days for each target child. 

Table 3 shows that in the intervention communities, there 
were signiﬁcantly fewer episodes of diarrhoea and ARIs 
for ‘whole families’ and for all subgroups. Analyses on all 
subjects providing data yielded similar results (Table 4), 
with the exception that the difference in the diarrhoea 
incidence in the 5-year-olds was no longer signiﬁcant. 

Table 5 shows that target children in the intervention 
group had signiﬁcantly fewer days absent due to their own 
or family illnesses. Analyses on all data collected yielded 
similar results. For absences due to child illness, 
PRRR = 28.4% (95% CI = 39.6%, 15.1%, P < 0.001); 
and for absences due to child or family illness, 
PRRR = 30.4 (95% CI = 41.7%, 16.9%, P < 0.001). 375 
of 847 (44.3%) intervention children and 261 of 833 
(31.3%) control children never missed school due to ill- 
nesses. After standardisation, this was calculated as a 
41.3% risk reduction. 







We restricted analyses on these illnesses to the 5-year- 
olds and ‘whole families’ due to concerns about a lack of 
power and a profusion of comparisons. Table 6 shows 
that 5-year-olds in the intervention communities had 
signiﬁcantly fewer eye infection episodes. No other 
differences were signiﬁcant. 
Analyses on all subjects providing data were consistent 
with the per-protocol analyses with the exception of boils 
episodes for ‘whole families’, with signiﬁcantly fewer 
episodes in controls (PRRR = 28.5%; 95% CI = 3.3%, 
59.9%, P = 0.024). The eye infection effect was still 
present for the target 5-year-olds (PRRR = (cid:1)40.7%, 
95% CI = (cid:1)53.3%, (cid:1)24.7%, P < 0.001). 

830 of 833 control households completing the study 
returned at least one wrapper during the study, indicating 
that soap was used in over 99% of control households

The results indicate that the intervention reduced epi- 
sodes of diarrhoea and ARIs for target 5-year-olds and 
their families. There were also fewer absences from 
school due to illness for the 5-year-olds. Secondary analy- 
ses suggest that the intervention also reduced eye infec- 
tions among the 5-year-olds. 

broadly consistent with previous reviews. For diarrhoea, 
observed RRRs were 25.3% for the 5-year-olds and 
30.7% for ‘whole families’. Curtis and Cairncross (2003) 
suggested hand washing promotions can reduce the risk 
of diarrhoea by 47% (95% CI = 24%, 63%). However, 
our results are closer to Ejemot-Nwadiaro et al. (2012), 
who estimated risk reductions in low-income countries to 
be 32% (95% CI = 10%, 48%). Observed RRRs for 
ARIs were 14.9% for 5-year-olds and 13.9% for all sub- 
jects. These are close to Rabie and Curtis (2006) who 
estimated the ARI risk reduction to be 16% (95% 
CI = 11%, 21%). 
The 27% reduction in absenteeism among intervention 
group 5-year-olds is lower than the 42% observed by Bo- 
wen et al. (2007). However, this study was larger than 
Bowen’s, which did not reach statistical signiﬁcance, and 
contributes more evidence of the effectiveness of hand 
washing with soap in reducing school absenteeism. 
Finally, we saw a reduction in the incidence of eye 
infections. Montessori et al. (1998) previously made a 
link between infection control measures, such as hand 
washing, and reduction in the transmission of keratocon- 
junctivitis in an eye care clinic. However, we believe that 
this is the ﬁrst direct evidence that a hand washing inter- 
vention alone can reduce incidence in a general popula- 
tion. While this is a secondary analysis, the effect is 
potentially important and may indicate that hand wash- 
ing reduces transmission of infection from the ﬁngers to 
the eyes.

required as, from our data, we cannot be ascertain why 
the whole family seems to beneﬁt from this intervention. 
Bowen et al. (2007) suggested that school age children 
may act as change agents with their friends and family. 
However, the mother may have also acted as the locus of 
behavioural change. Also, it is conceivable that the 
improved hygiene practices of the child and/or mother 
reduced their potency to act as vectors for transmissible 
illnesses. However, given the high level of soap consump- 
tion within intervention households, it seems unlikely

that the behavioural change was conﬁned to a single indi- 
vidual and more likely reﬂects increased soap use across 
a number of household members. 
It was impossible to ‘blind’ either the participants or 
those responsible for data collection. We tried to reduce 
recording biases by appointing separate hygiene promo- 
tion and data collection teams. Further, data collectors 
were only assigned to one of the treatment groups. 
We cannot rule out the possibility that respondents 
were, or became, aware of the link between HWWS and 
diarrhoea and ARIs. This may have led to over-reporting 
of these illnesses. However, such a speciﬁc bias does not 
explain the effects observed on eye infections for 5-year- 
olds, as participants would not have linked HWWS and 
eye infections. Over-reporting of eye infections would 
only result from a very general bias to over-report ill- 
nesses. If such a general bias existed, then we should have 
observed effects on all illnesses measured. 
The second limitation is that we were unable to deploy 
a direct measure of behaviour. The relatively greater soap 
consumption in the intervention communities suggests 
that soap use, at least in part, mediated the observed 
effects. However, soap consumption is only a proxy for 
hand washing with soap and does not necessarily demon- 
strate that behavioural changes occurred at key moments.

ties after randomisation, which should be avoided if at 
all possible. This became necessary mainly through errors 
in the initial characterisations and arising safety concerns. 
However, no data were collected in any of these eight 
communities. An exclusion that should be avoided in 
future was the one community where mothers had very 
low literacy levels. Involvement of the mothers was an 
important part of our approach. However, future hygiene 
promotions should design materials to ensure that these 
potentially vulnerable families should be included in any 
intervention. 

of public–private partnerships (PPPs) to deliver school- 
based HWWS interventions. We designed our promotion 
using a commercial social marketing approach informed 
by academic behaviour change theories. Curtis et al. 
(2007) argue that effective marketing communication is a 
key competency that the private sector brings to PPPs. 
Further, targeting school-aged children highlights a role 
for governments in providing access to schools. Use of 
classrooms may further improve cost-effectiveness and 
reach children in a setting where peer inﬂuences can be 
used to affect behaviour.
