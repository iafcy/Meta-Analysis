Abstract 
A social marketing approach used both qualitative and quantitative methods to develop a hygiene behav- 
iour intervention 
in rural north-east Thailand. Behaviours were preselected from a previous study and the 
intervention was designed to promote hand washing, especially before feeding a baby, cooking, eating, and 
after defaecation or cleaning a baby’s bottom, and dish washing immediately after eating. A bacteriological 
indicator 
changes in hand washing behaviour and observation 
practice. There was a significant 
disease as a result of the intervention. Furthermore, both indicators were retrospectively 
tively related to diarrhoeal disease incidence. However, receiving and being able to recall the intervention 
messages was not necessarily sufficient

their incidence rate of diarrhoeal disease as recorded by 
health services. Those containing 
large towns and dis- 
trict hospitals were excluded, and the 6 remaining, with 
the highest rates, were selected for the study. The inter- 
vention was varied in terms of cost (high oriow) and ad- 
ministered 
IFiaure). Ran- 
dom allocation was o&ridden

for 
a favourable environment 
to soak, thus providing 
bacterial growth. During 
food-related activities, cross- 
contamination was identified as the major mechanism

was not stressed in the messages, as it was rarely men-

with cleanliness

cleansing) and avoiding

bad spirits).

understood by the illiterate, and a project ‘logo’ provided 
continuity. Songs about the hygiene messages were re-

play, were broadcast

At the beginning of the intervention phase, school 
and village delegates were invited to workshops at the 
subdistrict level, to discuss project aims and examples 
of promotion activities. Participants were then invited to 
generate their own ideas during 
sessions. Two staff members were assigned to each sub- 
district for a period of 3 to 6 months and arranged fur- 
ther meetings in each of the villages and schools under 
their responsibility. The workshops were designed to 
stimulate community involvement in the planning and 
implementation of the communication strategy. Al- 
though the main target was the maternal heads of the 
households and mothers of young children, other family 
members were not excluded. 

A participatory approach in villages proved less effec- 
tive and more difficult to organize than that in primary 
schools. Although pupils were not the main target 
group, it was hoped that they could be influential as 
agents of change in their homes. The most successful 
school activities were constructing dish washing and 
hand washing facilities suited to the type of school water 
supply, and drawing competitions (in conjunction with 
art classes), with the best posters being displayed in the 
villages. The actual involvement of villagers depended 
more on individual personalities than official roles. 
Wherever possible, village activities were adjusted to 
stimulate interaction amongst villagers-e.g., 
the or- 
ganization, preparation and distribution of media. 
Questionnaires. A simple questionnaire was developed 
to measure message reception and recall. Questions on 
the content of the messages were worded so as to elimi- 
nate leading questions and bias. Two separate questions 
were asked for hand washing: ‘before/after which activi- 
ties do you think you should wash hands?’ Respondents 
were prompted for 2 answers per question, thus provid- 
ing a maximum of 4 correct answers: before cooking and 
eating, and after defaecation and cleaning a baby’s bot- 
tom. For washing dishes, the question was simply: 
‘should you wash dishes immediately before or after eat- 
ing? 
Indicators of behaviour. Since hand washing, in this 
context? is concerned with preventing faeco-oral disease 
transmission, a microbiological indicator was developed 
which involved examining the fingertips for the pres- 
ence of transient faecal indicator bacteria. Faecal strep- 
tococci were preferred because Escherichia coli is short- 
lived on the skin and its inability to survive remote cross 
contamination makes it an unsuitable indicator of hand 
washing practice (KALTERNTHALER 

Previously, a finger-rinse technique had been devel- 
oped to determine the number of bacteria on fingertips 
(PINFOLD et al:, 1988). This method was simplified to a 
finger impression technique. Each fingertip was pressed 
directly on to KF Streptococcus agar plates (9 cm diame- 
ter), which are large enough to sample both hands, leav- 
ing 10 prints. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h and 
enumerated by counting the number of prints contain- 
ing faecal streptococci. As this was a novel technique, 
particular attention was paid to the strain of organisms 
grown. Staphylococcus colonies, a common contaminant, 
were sometimes visually indistinguishable 
from Strepto- 
coccus, and were identified by their ability to produce gas 
from hydrogen peroxide. 
Although hand washing is an individual activity, the 
local environment and practices of other household 
members may also affect hand contamination. During 
the case study phase, finger impression samples were 
taken from 45 families visited on 4 occasions over a pe- 
riod of 6 weeks. Analysis of variance showed the vari- 
families to be far less than that between 
ance within 
families (P<O.OOOl). No apparent influence was detected 
of sex, age, or number of family members. Therefore, it 
was decided to produce a household index where the 
mean fingertip counts (O-10) of at least 3 family mem- 
bers represented the whole’ family (thus prov:ding a 
more normal distribution). 
In the results section. FSB 
(‘faecal streptococci before’) refers to this index before 
intervention and FSA (‘faecal streptococci after’) refers 
to the index after the intervention was completed. To 
help reduce daily variability, all sampling during the in- 
tervention study phase was conducted in the evening 
when most people were at home. 
In contrast to hand washing, dish washing behaviour 
can be easily assessed by the presence of dirty dishes. 
This greatly facilitated data collection, as the outcome 
could be readily defined and it took only a few minutes 
to check each home. Continuous observation of dish 
washing behaviour, meal times, and number of dishes 
washed-on each occasion helped to refine this method 
and validate the indicator. More dishes were left dirtv in 
the afternoon, but this also depended on whether there 
were people present during the day. To help control for 
this effect, all subsequent checks were conducted during 
the morning. 
Diarrhoeal disease. Active surveillance of children less 
than 5 years of age was conducted in the same villages as 
those in which the hand washing indicator was adminis- 
tered, including 6 villages from the high cost interven- 
tion, 6 from the low cost scheme, and 6 from the control. 
The survey took place during the seasonal peak of diar- 
rhoea incidence, but only after the intervention period. 
VHW were trained in diarrhoeal surveillance and moth- 
ers were issued with special calendars for recording diar- 
rhoea episodes of their children. For 3 months, VHW 
visited homes every week whenever nossible. Each 
month, project workers collected calendars from the 
VHW and monitored their work by visiting a random 
selection of homes. Diarrhoea was defined as 3 or more 
watery stools per day. About 75% of homes returned cal- 
endars each month that were validated by interviews 
with VHW. In addition, information on the reported in- 
cidence of diarrhoeal disease, for all ages, was collected 
from hospitals and clinics serving the study area. These 
data were checked with those compiled at the regional 
health centre. 
All quantitative data were entered on a micro-com- 
puter and analysed by the Statistical Package for Social 
Scientists (SPSSx). Unless otherwise stated, Student’s t- 
test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for com- 
paring group means. 

Socio-economic data for the intervention study vil- 
lages are summarized in Table 2. The mean duration of 
education was 4-6 years, and this did not vary consider- 
ably between villages. Although primary school atten- 
dance is now compulsory, few pupils (< 5%) from the 
project areas went on to secondary school or further edu-

cation. Without exception, the main occupation was ag- 
riculture, and in only 2 subdistricts, both located on ma- 
jor roads, did a significant proportion of families (but 
still fewer than 5%) cite non-agricultural work as their 
main occupation. Shallow wells, tube wells, rain jars and 
ponds were the main water sources. 

the intervention 
reached the vast majority of people in the intervention 
area, and less than 1% of those interviewed reported that 
they had not heard about the intervention; respondents 
were mainly female (98%) with a mean age of 39 years 
(range 10-76). Table 3 gives a summary of knowledge of 
the messages after intervention. Concerning hand wash- 
ing, villagers receiving 
the intervention were more 
knowledgeable than the controls, especially those from 
the high cost area (P<O.Ol). Knowledge of dish washing 
practice followed a similar pattern. A previous random 
survey of the intervention area before intervention had 
shown respondents to be less knowledgeable than those 
in control villages, suggesting that there may have been 
some contamination of the latter. 
The results from the hand washing indicator before 
(FSB) and after (FSA) intervention are shown in Table 
4. Although there was a significant reduction from FSB 
to FSA in the control villages, the reduction in the inter- 
vention villages was much greater. Comparing villages, 
FSB was similar in all groups but FSA was significantly 
less than the control value in both the low cost (PcO.01) 
and high cost (P<O.OOl) intervention areas; villages in 
the high cost scheme also gave lower values than those 
in the low cost area (P~0.05). The provision of plastic 
containers tended to show a marked improvement only 
in the homes in low cost intervention villages with the 
highest mean FSA values; overall, there was no signiti- 
cant difference between homes receiving containers and 
homes not receiving them. In order to test sustainability 
and reactivity, a selection of villages not previously sub- 
jected to the hand washing indicator was surveyed some 
5 months later. Four control villages produced a mean 
fingertip faecal streptococci index of 3.3, but interven- 
tion villages gave significantly 
lower values, 1.8 from 4 
low cost intervention 
villages (P<O.OOl) and 1.9 from 4 
villages in the high cost scheme (P~0.05). 
All homes were subjected to the dish washing indica- 
tor. Overall, there were significant 
improvements in 
both high cost (P<O.O5) and low cost intervention vil- 
lages (P<O*O5), with no apparent change in the control 
value. Six of 25 intervention villages showed a signifi- 
level and 4 
cant improvement at the 1% probability 
more at the 5% level, while 2 deteriorated; 3 of the 12 
control villages improved while 4 deteriorated 
(at the 5% 
probability level). 
Active surveillance of diarrhoeal disease in young 
children was conducted only after the intervention dur- 
ing the seasonal peak of summer diarrhoea in 6 control 
and 12 intervention villages. Diarrhoea was less com- 
mon in young children from the intervention villages, 
with 11 villages having 
rates of diar- 
lower 
rhoea than 5 control villages (PcO.05; Mann-Whitney 
U test); overall this amounted to a 39% reduction. 

Further evidence to support these results was pro- 
vided by comparing the hand-washing indicator with 
diarrhoeal disease data. Among a total of 220 homes, 
those with sick children had higher mean FSA values 
than those recording no diarrhoea (P<O.O5). Despite 
there being only 50 valid cases, the same relationship 
held true for the control villages, with mean values of 2.4 
for homes without diarrhoea and 3.6 for those with diar- 
rhoea (P<O.O5). 
As might be expected, about 10 times more cases of di- 
arrhoea in young children were recorded through active 
surveillance than reported to clinics and hospitals. The

study was not designed to show any significant differ- 
ence in reported diarrhoea, and there was no notable dif- 
ference as a result of the intervention or in comparison 
to the control. However, homes reporting no diarrhoea 
to health services in the year before intervention had 
mean FSB values of 3.8. comnared to 4.6 in homes re- 
porting one or more cases (fl<O+OOl). In the interven- 
tion villages, the same held true for FSA, with means of 
2.1 for 34 homes reporting diarrhoea after intervention 
and 1.2 from 107 homes with no diarrhoea P<O~Oll. 
Some of the biases in reporting were eliminated by in- 
cluding only homes reporting diarrhoea in the previous 
2 years. 
In the control villages, 3 separate surveys of dish 
washing behaviour were conducted at intervals of 4 
months. Comparing 2 extremes of this indicator, homes 
in which no dirty dish was seen in any of the 3 surveys 
reported a mean of 0.31 episodes of diarrhoea, while 
those in which dirty dishes were seen at all 3 surveys re- 
ported a mean of O-6 episodes, a 45% difference in the 
disease incidence (P<O.Ol). Intervention homes with no 
dirty dish after intervention reported 0.13 cases of diar- 
rhoea (after intervention) compared with 0.17 from 
homes with dirty dishes (PcO.05). The results from the 
questionnaire showed no notable relationship with any 
of the diarrhoea data. 

In questionnaires, hand washing before eating was in- 
variably identified as routine practice and more impor- 
tant than at other times such as after visiting the latrine 
or before cooking. However, observation before inter- 
vention revealed that, although hand washing was prac- 
tised at ceremonies or when entertaining special guests, 
it was rarely done before ordinary meals with family, 
relatives or friends. Hand washing was far more com- 
mon after eating when fingers were sticky, especially af- 
ter eating the staple diet of glutinous rice. This was con- 
firmed by information obtained from open interviews 
and group discussions, when hand washing was said to 
be more often done when hands were dirty rather than 
being motivated by another activity. These findings are 
in agreement with other studies on the limitations of us- 
ing questionnaires for measuring behaviour (STANTON et 
al., 1987; CURTIS et al, 1993). 
In comparison to continuous structured observation, 
the 2 indicators of behaviour readily provided quantifi- 
able data. The dish washing indicator was rather more 
straightforward, because there were tangible signs of this 
activity. Hand washing, on the other hand, is a difficult 
practice to measure by any means. Although the finger 
impression technique appeared to be useful as an indica- 
tor of general hand washing practice, it did not show 
specifically when hands were washed in relation to key 
activities. However, it may be a better overall indicator 
of the importance of different hygiene practices for dis- 
rupting faeco-oral disease transmission, as lingers play a 
major role in cross contamination at the oral end of this 
cycle. Even with good hand washing practice, the hand 
washing indicator would still reflect a contaminated lo- 
cal environment (e.g., from handling 
food, utensils, 
kitchen surfaces). Earlier studies have shown that house- 
holders living 
in modern homes with multiple water 
points, surfaces which are easy to clean, sinks for con- 
taining contamination, and refrigerators for food have 
considerably less hand contamination than those in the 
present study (PINFOLD, 1990a). Thus the finger impres- 
sion technique provides a simplified method for apprais- 
ing the need for modifying hygiene behaviour. 
Seasonal factors appeared to affect both indicators. 
Dish washing practice appeared to be largely affected by 
agricultural requirements, when rice planting and rice 
harvesting demand intensive labour by the whole family 
at certain times of the year. Climatic changes definitely 
affect fingertip contamination, with much higher levels 
apparent in the wet season than in the dry season (KAL- 
TENHALER et aZ., 1991; PINFOLD et aZ., 1991). This may 
partly explain the reduction in fingertip contamination 
found in the control villages and the high incidence of 
diarrhoea usually found, at the beginning of the rainy 
season. Despite the fact that surveys for each indicator 
were never administered on the same day, families with 
many dirty dishes after the intervention had higher lev- 
els of fingertip contamination 
than those with none 
(P<O.Ol). No similar relationship was found in the con- 
that families conforming to the 
trol villages, implying 
intervention advice were likely to adopt both practices 
rather than being selective. For larger programmes pro- 
moting 2 or more behaviours, it may be easier to select 
the simplest indicator when a similar relationship of 
adoption can be demonstrated. 

Health education nrogrammes often assume that, once 
their messages havebeen received by the intended-audi- 
ence, behaviour change will 
follow. In this 
studv. although villages with better overall knowledge of 
the messagesappeargd to have less hand contamina;ion, 
this relationship did not hold true when analysing 
homes within villages. Furthermore, unlike the indica- 
tors of behaviour, knowledge of the messages within the 
intervention group showed no significant relationship 
with diarrhoeal disease. Interviews conducted in depth 
after intervention revealed that, although most people 
knew the messages well, this alone was not enough to 
change behaviour. The main reason for non-compliance 
was the difficulty experienced by adults, as opposed to 
children, in breaking habits. On the other hand, con- 
formers gave a higher priority 
to cleanliness and avoid- 
ing ‘germs’. The results also suggested that active in- 
volvement in the intervention and discussion amongst 
the community about the promoted behaviours were im- 
portant factors for sustained improvement in the behav- 
iours. Thus, actual practice was reinforced when these 
actions were supported by neighbours, friends, relatives, 
and schoolchildren. This process was more successful in 
villages with a stronger sense of community. 
In this intervention more attention was placed on 
what the ‘consumer’ perceived to be the immediate 
benefit from practising these particular hygiene behav- 
iours. Education interventions usually emphasize dis- 
ease prevention without seeking knowledge of how 
benefits are perceived by the target group. When people 
are sick there is a definite need to find a cure. However, 
people are not sick most of the time and, given the poor 
recall of past episodes of illness (STANTON et al., 1987), it 
is difficult 
to envisage disease prevention as a priority 
need. Moreover, an individual would not be able to no- 
tice changes in disease rates for his or her family, even 
with the advantage of hindsight. Therefore, to some ex- 
tent health education programmes are relying on the 
communities’ faith in their proficiency. However, com- 
munities are likely to lose that trust if exposed to contin- 
ual programmes that fail to take into account their envi- 
ronmental constraints, and use messages that are 
patronizing.
