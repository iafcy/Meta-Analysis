Started in 2007, the Sanitation Hygiene Education and Water Supply in Bangladesh (SHEWA-B) project 
aims to improve the hygiene, sanitation and water supply for 20 million people in Bangladesh, and thus 
reduce disease among this population. This paper assesses the effectiveness of SHEWA-B on changing 
behaviors and reducing diarrhea and respiratory illness among children < 5 years of age. We assessed 
behaviors at baseline in 2007 and after 6 months and 18 months by conducting structured observation of 
handwashing behavior in 500 intervention and 500 control households. In addition we conducted spot 
checks of water and sanitation facilities in 850 intervention and 850 control households. We also 
collected monthly data on diarrhea and respiratory illness from 500 intervention and 500 control 
households from October 2007 to September 2009. Participants washed their hands with soap < 3% of 
the time around food related events in both intervention and control households at baseline and after 18 
months. Washing both hands with soap or ash after cleaning a child’s anus increased from 22% to 36%, 
and no access to a latrine decreased from 10% to 6.8% from baseline to 18 months. The prevalence of 
diarrhea and respiratory illness, among children <5 years of age were similar in intervention and control 
communities throughout the study. This large scale sanitation, hygiene and water improvement pro- 
gramme resulted in improvements in a few of its targeted behaviors, but these modest behavior changes 
have not yet resulted in a measurable reduction in childhood diarrhea and respiratory illness. 


In 2008, an estimated 1.3 million children <5 years of age died 
globally, including an estimated 20,000 in Bangladesh, due to 
diarrheal diseases. An additional 1.6 million children <5 years died 
due to pneumonia, including an estimated 26,000 in Bangladesh 
(Black et al., 2010). Numerous small scale interventions focused on 
improving hygiene practices and water treatment have been 
effective in reducing child diarrhea (Clasen, Roberts, Rabie, 
Schmidt, & Cairncross, 2006; Curtis & Cairncross, 2003; Ejemot, 
Ehiri, Meremikwu, & Critchley, 2008; Fewtrell et al., 2005; Luby 
et al., 2005; Shahid, Greenough, Samadi, Huq, & Rahman, 1996) 
and handwashing interventions with soap have reduced acute 
respiratory illness (Luby et al., 2005; Rabie & Curtis, 2006). There is 
also evidence that water storage and sanitation interventions

targeting up to a few thousand households can reduce diarrhea 
(Daniels, Cousens, Makoae, & Feachem, 1990; Doocy & Burnham, 
2006; Fewtrell et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 2001). 
Many available, affordable and effective interventions linked to 
improved child health do not reach children in greatest need, due to 
difﬁculties in scaling up. Scaling up refers to the increased ﬁnancial, 
human and capital resources required to expand coverage of locally 
tested pilot or experimental interventions so that beneﬁts will 
increase and be shared with a larger target population (Mangham & 
Hanson, 2010; Simmons, Fajans, & Ghiron, 2007). Difﬁculties in 
scaling up proven effective interventions include weakness in 
limited 
delivery systems, 
resources, difﬁculties in estimating resource requirements and 
spending those resources effectively and efﬁciently, and the short 
timeframe for planning, implementing, integrating, and sustaining 
the interventions (Mangham & Hanson, 2010; Victora, Hanson, 
Bryce, & Vaughan, 2004). However, historically, large scale inter- 
ventions have not been rigorously evaluated, and their health 
impact is unclear (Bajracharya, 2003; Biran et al., 2009; Bowen 






et al., 2007; Nanan, White, Azam, Afsar, & Hozhabri, 2003). In 
Myanmar, the National Sanitation Week and Social Mobilization for 
Sanitation and Hygiene programme contributed to a signiﬁcant 
increase in access to sanitary means of excreta disposal and 
handwashing with soap and water after defecation, but no health 
outcome was measured (Bajracharya, 2003). An evaluation of 
a water, sanitation and hygiene programme implemented in 
Pakistan showed a signiﬁcant reduction in diarrhea, but this eval- 
uation did not capture the interim behaviors that lead to reduction 
in diarrhea (Nanan et al., 2003). Overall, it remains unclear if 
interventions that have resulted in less diarrhea and acute respi- 
ratory illness in children <5 years of age in carefully controlled 
trials, targeting up to a few thousand households, can still achieve 
a similar level of health beneﬁts when taken to a large scale. 
In 2007 the Government of Bangladesh launched the Sanitation, 
Hygiene Education and Water Supply in Bangladesh Programme 
(SHEWA-B), an intervention funded by the United Kingdom’s 
Department for International Development (DFID), with technical 
support from United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). SHEWA-B, 
a large scale 5 year programme, targets 20 million rural people 
and aims to improve standards of hygiene practices and behavior 
on a sustainable basis, while ensuring adequate sanitation and safe 
water supply. The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease 
Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) was requested to design and 
conduct a rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of SHEWA-B 
(Halder et al., 2010; Luby et al., 2009). This paper assesses the 
effectiveness of SHEWA-B on changing targeted behaviors and its 
impact on diarrhea and respiratory illness among children < 5 
years of age after ﬁrst 18 months of implementation. 


The SHEWA-B program targeted 68 sub-districts in 19 districts. 
The government and UNICEF selected the speciﬁc intervention sub- 
districts because of the perceived need and the absence of other 
active programs addressing water, sanitation and hygiene in these 
communities. Sub-districts are further subdivided into unions. To 
select the assessment population, we ﬁrst listed all unions, the 
smallest administrative unit in Bangladesh, comprised of a number 
of villages, under their sub-district and district location. Then we 
randomly selected 50 unions where the probability of selection was 
proportional to the size of the union. In each union, a group of 10e17 
households from a randomly selected village was considered 
a cluster. For each SHEWA-B sub-district where we chose a union for 
evaluation we selected a control sub-district that had similar geog- 
raphy, hydrogeology, infrastructure, agricultural productivity, and 
household construction, and where the government conﬁrmed that 
no other major water-sanitation-hygiene programs were ongoing. 
Once a union was selected, the research ﬁeld team selected 
a village from an enumerated list of the union villages using 
a random number generator. We traveled to the selected village, 
asked residents to identify the village centre, and then enrolled the 
ﬁrst closest eligible household. A household was considered 
eligible if it had a child <5 years of age and a guardian of the child 
agreed to participate in the study. To enroll the next household, we 
skipped the next two closest households, and then looked for the 
next closest eligible household. The process for enrolling the next 
closest household was repeated until the sample size from the 
selected union starting point was met. 
We calculated required sample sizes for different survey 
components considering the outcome indicators of interest for each 
component. For the structured observation of handwashing with 
soap, we estimated a baseline of 28% that would increase to 43% after 
2 years of intervention. For the cross sectional survey we estimated 
the proportion of households using their own or shared latrine to be 
66% at baseline and increasing to 75% after 2 years of intervention. 
For calculating the sample size to measure diarrhea prevalence in 
the last 15 days we estimated 25% at baseline decreasing to 17.5% 
after 2 years of intervention. While calculating the sample size, we 
assumed 80% power, 95% conﬁdence and a design effect of 2 to offset 
village level clustering. We aimed to enroll 1000 households for 
structured observations, 1700 household for the cross sectional 
survey and 1000 households for diarrhea surveillance, all equally 
split between intervention and control communities. 

Based on a large three year pilot program (Eusuf and Associates, 
2006), the project engaged local residents, under the guidance of 
local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), to develop their own 
community action plans, including targets for improvements in 
latrine coverage and usage; access to and use of arsenic-free water; 
and improved hygiene practices, especially handwashing with soap. 
SHEWA-B trained and recruited more than 10,000 local residents 
who had at least 10 years of schooling to serve as community hygiene 
promoters. These promoters received 10 days of training on behavior 
change communication materials related to water, sanitation and 
hygiene. They visited households, facilitated courtyard meetings and 
organized social mobilization activities. These included water, sani- 
tation and hygiene fairs, village theater, and group discussions in tea 
stalls, the social meeting point for village men. During the promo- 
tional activities the promoters used ﬂip charts and ﬂash cards. The 
messages alerted participants to the presence of unobservable 
“germs” in their home environment and practices that would mini- 
mize the impact of germs on the health of the family. The promotional 
activities were intended to encourage active participation of the 
community members. Each community hygiene promoter was 
expected to reach an average of 2000 individuals every two months 
through household visits and courtyard meetings. Since SHEWA-B 
was a programme implemented at large scale, the position of the 
community hygiene promoters was considered as an intermediate 
between volunteers and paid staff, so that their incentive was 
affordable to the local government. Incentives included prestige as 
well as a modest salary, approximately 1 US dollar per day, which is 
approximately one half that of an unskilled laborer. The community 
hygiene promoters were trained to deliver 11 key messages (Box 1).

UNICEF and the Government of Bangladesh were particularly 
interested in the impact the program had on diarrhea and respi- 
ratory illness among children <5 years of age. Key behavioral 
indicators targeted by SHEWA-B that may affect these health 
feces and waste 
outcomes include handwashing, 
disposal, and water storage (Curtis et al., 1995; Lanata, Huttly, & 
Yeager, 1998; LeBaron et al., 1990; Roberts et al., 2001; Stanton & 
Clemens, 1987; Traore et al., 1994). 


The research assistants collected baseline data in 2007 from 
intervention and control households. To provide early feedback on 
the effectiveness of 
the intervention efforts in intervention 
households, we conducted an interim assessment after 6 months of 
promotional activities. In 2009, after approximately 18 months of 
promotional activities, data were collected from a different 
randomly selected set of intervention and control households. 

The research assistants conducted 5 h of structured observation 
of handwashing and child feces disposal behaviors of all persons in 
the selected households from 9 AM to 2 PM. This time was 
considered culturally acceptable for visitors and the usual time for 
a range of personal hygiene and food preparation behaviors. Using 
a pretested instrument the ﬁeld team noted behaviors at key 
handwashing opportunities, such as after own or child’s defecation, 
prior to preparing and serving food, prior to eating and feeding 
a child. The research assistants noted whether the household 
residents washed their hands or not, and if so, if they used water 
only, soap, and/or ash. Within each household, during the 5 h of 
observation, research assistants often observed multiple occasions 
of the same opportunity for handwashing and recorded each 
episode separately. 

After completing all the household observations the research 
assistants returned to administer a cross-sectional survey and 
perform a spot check. The cross sectional survey included demo- 
graphic information, data on households’ hygiene, sanitation, water 
supply status, as well as household construction and possessions to 
permit a measurement of acquired household wealth. The spot 
checks included information on type of household water and 
sanitation infrastructures. 

We recruited and trained one educated female resident from 
each evaluation community to collect information on disease 
burden. These community monitors visited each enrolled house- 
hold each month for 24 months after baseline, and administered 
a brief questionnaire. This monthly surveillance questionnaire 
included information on any episodes of acute respiratory illness 
and diarrhea of each child <5 years of age during the two days 
preceding the interview. 

We classiﬁed improved latrines using the WHO/UNICEF Joint 
Monitoring Programme deﬁnitions (WHO & UNICEF, 2008). We 
considered lack of access to a latrine as reported by the respondent 
and veriﬁed by spot check of the household as an indicator of open 
defecation. Any latrine was considered clean if no feces were 
observed in and around the slab of the latrine. We classiﬁed 
disposal of child’s feces as appropriate if feces were observed to be 
disposed in a toilet or in a speciﬁc pit. 
We classiﬁed a household as having appropriate solid waste 
disposal if it had either a drum or a speciﬁc pit, and our survey team 
visually conﬁrmed that household solid waste was disposed there, 
with no waste observed outside the pit or drum. We classiﬁed 
water drainage as appropriate if a household had either a drain 
(constructed with or without concrete and cement) or a soak pit. 
We considered a household to store water in a covered container if 
all the containers found in the house were fully covered at the time 
of visit to the household. 
We classiﬁed acute respiratory illness as having cough and fever 
or difﬁculty breathing and fever within 48 h prior to interview 
(Alam, Henry, & Rahaman, 1989; Boerma, Black, Sommerfelt, 
Rutstein, & Bicego, 1991; Zafar, Luby, & Mendoza, 2010). Diarrhea 
was deﬁned as the passage of 3 or more loose or watery stools in 
the preceding 24 h period and we collected data on episodes of 
diarrhea in the 48 h prior to interview. 

We evaluated the change in outcome indicators related to water 
use, sanitation and hygiene between the baseline and follow-up 
within the intervention communities and compared these differ- 
ences to any differences observed in the control group during the 
same period using linear mixed effect logistic regression. We 
allowed for random effects within village cluster and within 
household nested in the village. The logistic regression models 
consist of main effects for: 1) intervention or control study groups; 
2) time of data collection; baseline or 18 months; and 3) interaction 
between 1 and 2. 
To account for the repeated observations for diarrhea and acute 
respiratory illness in single households and the clustering of 
observations in villages, we used generalized estimated equations 
to calculate the cluster adjusted P values and 95% conﬁdence 
intervals. 
To analyze the data on behavior change we used STATA software 
version 10 for linear mixed effect logistic regression analysis. We 
used SAS for Windows, (PROC GENMOD) Version 9.1 (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC, USA) for the generalized estimated equations modeling to 
analyze the data on health outcome. 

All study participants provided written informed consent. The 
Government of Bangladesh Department of Public Health Engi- 
neering and UNICEF approved the evaluation. ICDDR,B adminis- 
tration provided an expedited approval of the study. 

There was little difference in social and demographic charac- 
teristics between the intervention and control households both at 
baseline and 18 months (Table 1). 
Participants washed their hands with soap < 3% of the time 
around food related events, including before preparing food, before 
serving/handling food, before eating and before feeding a child, at 
baselineand after 18 months. There was no signiﬁcant difference in 
food related hand washing behavior from baseline to 18 months in 
the intervention group compared with the control group (Table 2). 
Residents of intervention households increased the frequency 
that they washed both hands with soap or ash after cleaning

a child’s anus from 22% at baseline to 36% at 18 months assessment. 
Residents of control households increased the frequency that they 
washed both hands with soap or ash after cleaning a child’s anus 
from 24% at baseline to 27% at 18 months. The improvement in the 
frequency of washing both hands with soap or ash after cleaning 
a child’s anus in the intervention group was signiﬁcantly greater 
than the improvement in the control group (P < 0.05) (Table 2). 
Residents of intervention households increased the frequency 
that they washed both hands with soap or ash after defecation 
from 17% at baseline to 30% at 18 months. Residents of control 
households increased the frequency that they washed both 
hands with soap or ash after defecation from 18% at baseline to 
23% at 18 months. The improvement in handwashing after 
defecation in the intervention group was not signiﬁcantly greater 
than the improvement observed in the control group (P ¼ 0.20) 
(Table 2). 
During the baseline, spot checks identiﬁed that 10.3% of 
households in intervention areas had no access to latrine. This 
decreased to 6.8% after 18 months, and was signiﬁcantly greater 
than in the control communities (P < 0.05) (Table 2). 
The proportion of households with latrines with no visible feces 
on and around the slab, appropriate disposal of child feces, and 
drinking water stored in a covered container improved from 
baseline to 18 months in the intervention communities. Similar 
improvements were also seen in the control communities, so there 
was no signiﬁcant difference between intervention and control 
communities. Other indicators related with access to improved 
latrines, solid waste disposal and drainage systems, and covered 
containers for water storage did not improve signiﬁcantly in the 
intervention communities when compared with control commu- 
nities (Table 2). 
The prevalence of childhood diarrhea and respiratory illness 
was similar in the intervention and control communities. Overall, 
during monthly visits during the ﬁrst 24 months, 10.1% of children 
<5 years of age living in intervention communities were reported 
to have diarrhea in the preceding two days compared to 9.9% of 
children <5 years living in control communities (P ¼ 0.56) (Fig. 1). 
Similarly, 12.6% of children <5 years in the intervention areas had 
respiratory illness on monthly visits compared to 13.0% in the 
control area (P ¼ 0.61) (Fig. 2). 

After 18 months of promoting key behaviors related to sanita- 
tion, hygiene, and safe water, targeting 20 million rural Banglade- 
shis, the improvements observed for a few key behaviors were 
modest. These included an increase in washing both hands with 
soap/ash after cleaning a child’s bottom, a decrease in the number 
of households lacking access to a latrine, and an increase in storage 
of drinking water in containers. Our evaluation of SHEWA-B 
included matched intervention and non-intervention control 
characteristics, 
groups, 
increasing the likelihood that these improvements were due to the 
intervention. However, our evaluation found, at this stage, no 
reduction in the prevalence of diarrhea or respiratory disease 
among children <5 years of age in the households from the inter- 
vention areas. These data suggest that SHEWA-B has not yet 
improved behaviors related to handwashing, latrine use, feces and 
waste disposal, and water storage sufﬁciently to lead to a detectable 
decrease in diarrhea and acute respiratory illness. 


The lack of a measurable impact on the majority of targeted 
outcomes was not because of low statistical power. The sample size

b For each indicator presented in the row, the % calculations were made as follows, using Before preparing food and “used soap while washing both hands” as an example: 
n ¼ no. of observations where households member prepared food and washed both hands with soap and N ¼ no. of observations where households member prepared food. 
was sufﬁcient to detect expected effects of the intervention, and the 
baseline estimates for each indicator were based on the pilot study 
conducted prior to SHEWA-B in the similar areas of Bangladesh. 
There is little available published literature as to how best to 
scale up successful small scale water, sanitation and hygiene 
promotion interventions and still obtain a similar level of health 
beneﬁt. Previous hand washing intervention trials with several 
thousand enrolled households found signiﬁcant reductions in 
diarrhea and respiratory illness, but those studies often provided 
free soap with frequent community meetings and weekly house- 
hold visits (Han & Hlaing, 1989; Khan, 1982; Luby et al., 2005; Luby 
et al., 2004; Stanton & Clemens, 1987). For example, an evaluation 
in a refugee camp setting suggested that improved water storage 
reduced the risk of diarrhea by 31% (Roberts et al., 2001). However, 
we were unable to identify any other evidence that water storage 
promotion implemented at large scale at the community level 
improved health. Only a few studies found sanitation interventions 
associated with reduction in diarrhea, and these often provided 
sanitary hardware and installation of infrastructure. (Barreto et al., 
2007; Daniels et al., 1990; Esrey, Potash, Roberts, & Shiff, 1991). For 
example, a study that used a before and after assessment design in 
Salvador, Brazil found a city wide reduction of diarrhea after city 
wide improvement in sanitation coverage (Barreto et al., 2007). 
There is some evidence of health impact when multiple water 
sanitation and hygiene interventions were introduced jointly, but 
those were studies of up to a few thousand households and often 
had provision of infrastructure (Aziz et al., 1990; Hoque, Juncker, 
Sack, Ali, & Aziz, 1996; Mertens et al., 1990; Messou, Sangare, 
Josseran, Le Corre, & Guelain, 1997). Assessment of a large scale 
integrated package of water, sanitation and hygiene activities 
implemented in Pakistan found that the children from non- 
intervention villages had a 33% higher adjusted odds ratio for 
diarrhea compared to those from the intervention villages after 5 
years. However, the study used a case-control design so that the 
intervention was not randomly assigned. As a result, the villages 
that were selected for the interventions were different from the

the intervention and control groups (October 2007eSeptember 2009).

control villages (Nanan et al., 2003). Another large hygiene 
promotion programme conducted in Burkina Faso measured 
behavior change, but not health impact (Curtis et al., 2001). 
The evaluation ﬁndings suggest that SHEWA-B did not yet result 
in a measurable decrease in the prevalence of diarrhea and acute 
respiratory illness because it did not yet sufﬁciently improve the 
targeted behaviors. When compared with the control group there 
were modest improvements in handwashing with soap after 
cleaning a child’s bottom after defecation. While signiﬁcant 
improvement was seen in handwashing with soap after defecation 
from 17% to 30%, 
from 
improvements in control areas. Improvements in handwashing 
before preparing food or eating were not signiﬁcant. In over 64% of 
observed instances, hands were not washed with soap after defe- 
cation and after cleaning a child’s anus. In studies targeting up to 
a few thousand households, lower incidence of diarrhea was found 
when handwashing with soap was promoted before preparing 
food, before eating, and after defecation (Khan, 1982; Pinfold & 
Horan, 1996; Shahid et al., 1996; Wilson, Chandler, Muslihatun, & 
Jamiluddin, 1991). 

While there were fewer households lacking access to a latrine in 
the intervention communities compared to the control communi- 
ties, there were similar proportions of households with access to an 
improved latrine after 18 months. In a previous study, reduced 
reported diarrhea was associated with latrine ownership (Daniels 
et al., 1990). 
Eighteen months of SHEWA-B intervention did not sufﬁciently 
improve targeted behaviors nor did it reduce diarrhea and respi- 
ratory illness. Perhaps the intervention, as designed, was insufﬁ- 
cient to produce the targeted behavior change. The SHEWA-B 
intervention promoted hygiene primarily through increasing 
awareness and imparting health information, strategies that in 
some context have been ineffective (Biran et al., 2009; Scott, Curtis, 
Rabie, & Garbrah-Aidoo, 2007). Knowledge is often insufﬁcient to 
change behavior. The pilot programme implemented before 
SHEWA-B in rural Bangladesh used a similar intervention, and 
found marked improvement in self-reported behaviors (Eusuf and 
Associates, 2006), but the assessment of the pilot likely over- 
estimated the effect of the intervention, because it did not enroll 
a control group and depended upon self-reporting of behavior. 
Alternatively, perhaps the intervention design was sound, but it 
was not implemented with sufﬁcient thoroughness to achieve the 
study targets. SHEWA-B was implemented by local NGOs who were 
monitored by local government staff and community leaders. 
UNICEF assessed the NGOs’ performance considering ﬁnancial 
management, progress toward community action plan and targets, 
and household feedback on community hygiene promoter’s visit. 
The assessment concluded that 41 out of 58 NGOs (71%) performed 
well enough for contract extension (Personal communication, 
Luzma Montano, UNICEF, Bangladesh). However, we do not have 
systematic data on process indicators to inform us if the commu- 
nities were actually reached by the interventions, how often, and 
how effectively. As a result we cannot conﬁrm how closely the 
program intervention was implemented as designed. Future eval- 
uation of similar large scale programmes would beneﬁt from 
rigorous monitoring of the implementation process and coverage. 
SHEWA-B targets a large population. Even with 10,000 
community hygiene promoters, each person was responsible for 
educating about 2000 individuals. Moreover, we do not know 
whether 10 days training was sufﬁcient to equip the community 
hygiene promoters with the skills necessary to facilitate the 
implementation of the community action plans as designed. 
How much behavior change can be expected from a large scale 
water, sanitation and hygiene intervention? Among the behaviors 
that improved after 18 months of SHEWA-B, the magnitude of the 
behavior change was similar to other large behavioral interven- 
tions. In our study there was a 14% improvement in observed 
handwashing behavior after cleaning a child’s bottom compared to 
18% increase in a study done in Burkina Faso (Curtis et al., 2001). 
There was not yet an improvement in child’s feces disposal in our 
study, which may compare similarly to the study done in Burkina 
Faso (Curtis et al., 2001). While SHEWA-B did not yet change the 
behavior substantially enough to see improvement in health, we do 
not know how much change in behaviors is needed. Many of the 
signiﬁcant improvements were seen in the ﬁrst 6 months (data not 
shown), and only marginal further improvements were detected 
over the next 12 months. So, additional time is not necessarily 
beneﬁcial. 
Our evaluation of SHEWA-B was designed to avoid speciﬁc 
pitfalls identiﬁed by earlier researchers (Blum & Feachem, 1983). 
First, the SHEWA-B evaluation enrolled a control group carefully 
selected in consultation with Department of Public Health Engi- 
neering of the Government of Bangladesh, who were responsible 
for implementing SHEWA-B and conﬁrmed that there was no 
similar intervention ongoing. If there were other broad effective 
national campaigns, we would have been aware of them. If any 
campaign had been effective in improving hygiene behavior in the 
control group we would have seen parallel improvement in the 
control group with the intervention group. However, we saw very 
little improvement in the behavior of the control group, and so no 
evidence of their being a broad national program. We avoided 
comparing a single intervention community with a single control 
community by enrolling a random sample of 50 intervention and 
50 control communities. This provided a sufﬁcient sample size to 
permit assessment of the SHEWA-B in a wide variety of settings 
that are representative of the target population. The primary 
outcome for health was a 48 h recall of diarrhea and respiratory 
disease, a recall period that has been demonstrated to be the most 
accurate (Zafar, Luby, & Mendoza, 2009). 
In this study we have found that prevalence of diarrhea and 
acute respiratory illness reduced gradually over an 18 month period 
both in the intervention and control areas. Possible explanations for 
this reduction include the aging of the cohort, the variability of 
diarrhea measurements (Luby, Agboatwalla, & Hoekstra, 2011), and 
surveillance fatigue. The community monitors who collected data 
on disease frequency were not aware of the hypothesis that framed 
this analysis. Child illness in these communities is common and not 
shameful, so we would not expect any biases in reporting. 
Although, community monitors did not have the same level of skills 
as the research assistants employed for this study, they were 
carefully trained using simple instruments and their results were 
consistent with the very modest changes seen in behavior by the 
more highly educated research team. 
Handwashing behavior is difﬁcult to assess. Responses to 
questions about hand washing are substantially different from 
observed behavior and are considered less valid (Manun’Ebo et al., 
1997). Thus data from structured observations have been used to 
assess handwashing, but we also collected other measures of 
handwashing including spot checks for handwashing infrastruc- 
ture, measures of hand cleanliness, and reported handwashing that 
all showed results consistent with the very modest impacts 
observed in structured observation (data not shown). We observed 
fewer defecation-related than food-related handwashing oppor- 
tunities, because we missed many defecation events performed 
early in the morning. However, for both intervention and control 
groups we followed similar observation timings to collect data. It is 
possible that the intervention led the study participants to under- 
stand that washing both hands with soap after fecal contact was 
appropriate behavior. If so, then in the presence of an observer, the 
study participant may have been more likely to wash both hands 


with soap because of this social expectation (Ram et al., 2010). 
However, a study conducted in India found that the presence of an 
observer did not inﬂuence study participants’ handwashing prac- 
tices (Biran et al., 2009), though this may have been such an inef- 
fective intervention that it simply did not affect the social norm. We 
attempted to reduce the impact of the observer by conducting 
observations for extended 5-h periods rather than shorter time 
intervals that have been associated with increased reactivity (Ruel 
& Arimond, 2002). Furthermore, we enrolled a new set of randomly 
selected households for the post intervention evaluation which 
likely minimized the reactivity that could occur from conducting 
repeat observations. 
The ongoing health impact evaluation of SHEWA-B provides 
a singularly rigorous assessment of the impact of a large scale 
intervention on behavior and health in the target communities. The 
approach of SHEWA-B targeting multiple interventions with 
several sanitation, hygiene and water related key messages, 
implemented at large scale, was insufﬁcient to change most health 
practices and the health status of children <5 years of age in rural 
Bangladesh after the ﬁrst 18 months of implementation. Although 
the intervention to date has not reached the majority of its 
behavioral and health targets, the commitment to a rigorous 
external evaluation provides valuable insights for program donors 
and implementers on how this and other large scale intervention 
programs can be improved. The 6 month assessment of SHEWA-B 
helped to make the programme targets more realistic, while the 
18 month assessment led UNICEF and program implementers to 
revise the behavior change strategy by focusing on fewer behaviors 
and using mass media to support the communication messages. 
More research on how to implement proven water sanitation and 
hygiene interventions at scale will beneﬁt future investment in 
large scale water, sanitation and hygiene intervention programmes. 
Additionally, continuing rigorous evaluation and dissemination of 
results could help to improve ongoing programs and answer key 
questions about how to scale up such interventions effectively and 
thereby improve the health of children <5 years of age in low 
income countries.
