The project’s products and messages made it more 
convenient 
for families to practice cleanliness and 
sanitation behaviours. For example, it was observed 
that once provided with a dirt thrower, other family 
members became more willing to clean feces, while 
it had been only the mother’s task. This 
previously 
enthusiastic 
response was due to the fact that this 
product allowed users to keep their hands clean and 
to remove feces completely from the ground [25]. As 
expected, 
the higher adoption of the interventions 
was associated with a higher score in overall cleanli- 
ness behaviours. These in turn may have contributed 
to reduced diarrhoeal
