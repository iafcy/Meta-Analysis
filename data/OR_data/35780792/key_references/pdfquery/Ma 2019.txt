Although there is mounting evidence demonstrating beneficial effects of community health 
workers (CHWs), few studies have examined the impact of CHW programs focused on pre- 
venting infectious diseases in children through behavior changes. We assessed the preven- 
tive effects of community health volunteers (CHVs), who receive no financial incentive, on 
child diarrhea and fever prevalence in Ghana. 

We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in 40 communities in the Volta Region, 
Ghana. Twenty communities were randomly allocated to the intervention arm, and 20 to the 
control arm, using a computer-generated block randomization list. In the intervention arm, 
CHVs were deployed in their own community with the key task of conducting home visits for 
health education and community mobilization. The primary outcomes of the trial were diar- 
rhea and fever prevalence at 6 and 12 months among under-5 children based on caregivers’ 
recall. Secondary outcomes included oral rehydration treatment and rapid diagnostic testing 
for malaria among under-5 children, and family planning practices of caregivers. General- 
ized estimating equations (GEEs) with a log link and exchangeable correlation matrix were 
used to determine the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for diarrhea, 
fever, and secondary outcomes adjusted for clustering and stratification. Between April 18 
and May 4, 2015, 1,956 children were recruited and followed up until September 20, 2016. 
At 6 and 12 months post-randomization, 1,660 (85%) and 1,609 (82%) participants, respec- 
tively, had outcomes assessed. CHVs’ home visits had no statistically significant effect on 
diarrhea or fever prevalence at either time point. After a follow-up of 12 months, the

prevalence of diarrhea and fever was 7.0% (55/784) and 18.4% (144/784), respectively, in 
the control communities and 4.5% (37/825) and 14.7% (121/825), respectively, in the inter- 
vention communities (12-month RR adjusted for clustering and stratification: diarrhea, RR 
0.73, 95% CI 0.37–1.45, p = 0.37; fever, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51–1.14, p = 0.20). However, 
the following were observed: improved hand hygiene practices, increased utilization of 
insecticide-treated bed nets, and greater participation in community outreach programs (p- 
values < 0.05) in the intervention group. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, the prevalence of 
diarrhea and fever at 6 months was 3.2% (2/62) and 17.7% (11/62), respectively, in the 
intervention communities with �70% coverage and a �30-minute visit duration, and 14.4% 
(116/806) and 30.2% (243/806) in the control communities (RR adjusted for clustering, strat- 
ification, baseline prevalence, and covariates: diarrhea, RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09–0.60, p = 
0.003; fever, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.92, p = 0.01). The main limitations were the following: 
We were unable to investigate the longer-term effects of CHVs; the trial may have been 
underpowered to detect small to moderate effects due to the large decline in diarrheal and 
fever prevalence in both the intervention and control group; and caregivers’ practices were 
based on self-report, and the possibility of caregivers providing socially desirable responses 
cannot be excluded. 

We found no effect of CHVs’ home visits on the prevalence of child diarrhea or fever. How- 
ever, CHV programs with high community coverage and regular household contacts of 
effective duration may reduce childhood infectious disease prevalence. 







(CHWs) including interventions for nutrition, maternal health, birth and newborn care 
preparedness, neonatal health, and promotion of breastfeeding. Many of the previous 
studies of CHW interventions have focused on case management, immunization, or 
child mortality. 
• Only a few randomized controlled trials have explored the promotive effect of CHWs 
on infectious disease in children through health education, particularly when CHWs 
were assigned comprehensive tasks on a voluntary basis, including community mobili- 
zation, home visits, minor illness treatment, support of the professional health work- 
force, surveillance, and referral of patients to health facilities, and the results were 
mixed. 


Globally, 5.4 million deaths occurred among children younger than 5 years in 2017; diarrhea 
and malaria are estimated to have caused 533,800 and 266,000 of these deaths, respectively 
[1,2]. Although a substantial number of child deaths from diarrhea and malaria could be 
averted by existing interventions, many low- and middle-income countries have suboptimal 
coverage of these interventions and face a severe shortage of the workforce needed to deliver 
essential health services [3]. Accordingly, the global health community has renewed its interest 
in the potential contributions of community health workers (CHWs) [4]. 
A wide range of interventions can be delivered by CHWs, including nutritional, neonatal 
health, and maternal health interventions [5]. However, although there is mounting evidence 
demonstrating the beneficial effect of CHWs on disease treatment, breastfeeding, and overall 
child mortality, few studies have examined the impact of CHW programs focused on prevent- 
ing infectious diseases in children through behavior change communication [6–8]. A recent 
systematic review [5] identified only 4 randomized controlled trials that were conducted to 
assess the effects of CHWs on childhood illnesses in low- and middle-income countries in 
which the primary outcome was immunization coverage or case management, and found 
mixed results [9–11]. A trial [10] in Malawi found that volunteer counseling through home

rhea and fever prevalence in children under 5 years of age, and the participants were fol- 
lowed up at 6 and 12 months after the intervention started. Associations of CHVs’ home 
visit coverage and intensity with the primary outcomes, 14-day diarrhea and fever prev- 
alence, were also examined. 

we found significant differences in some health behaviors to prevent diarrhea and 
malaria between the intervention and control groups. We found that the communities 
in which the CHV intervention was fully implemented had lower risks of both diarrhea 
and fever compared to control communities. 




where the CHV intervention reached �70% coverage of home visits, with an average 
visit duration of �30 minutes. 
• This study has policy implications for CHW home visit programs, particularly regarding 
the frequency and duration of home visits and the optimal number of educational mes- 
sages to be delivered. 

visits led to a significant reduction in reported infant cough, fever, or diarrhea, whereas there 
was no effect of a community-based worker program on child cough, fever, or diarrhea preva- 
lence in a trial [9] conducted in India. Overall, the effectiveness of CHWs for preventing rou- 
tine childhood diseases remains unclear. 
In 2005, Ghana adopted the Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) ini- 
tiative, which intends to improve the health of people living in rural areas of the country [12]. 
Two cadres of CHWs collaborate to provide primary healthcare in the CHPS system in Ghana: 
community health nurses (CHNs) and community health volunteers (CHVs). CHNs are 
trained for 2 years as licensed nurses and recruited as salaried government employees, while 
CHVs are trained for less than 6 weeks and do not receive any financial incentives. CHVs are 
tasked with providing health education, birth and death registration, disease surveillance, and 
minor illness treatment. The effects of the Ghana CHV program on child health remain 
unknown [13]. In order to address this gap, we present a cluster-randomized trial that exam- 
ined the effect of CHVs on child diarrhea and fever prevalence in rural Ghana. We also explore 
whether community coverage and duration of home visits influence the impact of the CHV 
program. 
Methods 
Study design and participants 
We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in 40 communities (villages) of the Ketu 
South District in the Volta Region, Ghana, between February 1, 2015 and September 20, 2016 
(ISRCTN49236178) [14]. The baseline survey, and recruitment of caregivers (mother or pri- 
mary female caregiver) and under-5 children, began on April 18, 2015, and the trial was regis- 
tered on June 16, 2015. Randomization was performed in June 2015 using the baseline survey 
results, and the intervention started on August 15, 2015. The estimated population of the Ketu 
South District in 2015 was 181,881, and the number of children aged under 5 years was 36,376. 
Communities in the study area had a range of 130–254 households. A phase-in design was 
adopted for the trial, wherein the CHVs were recruited and activated in the 20 intervention 
communities during the trial period, while the 20 communities in the control arm received 
CHVs after completion of the end line survey of the trial. Ethical approval for the trial was 
obtained from the Ghana Health Service Ethics Review Committee (GHS-ERC:07/01/15), and 
the evaluation was supplementarily approved by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public 
Health (IRB17-2051). 
We assured allocation concealment for participants by selecting them before randomizing 
clusters [15]. The study recruited participants from April 18 to May 4, 2015. The inclusion cri- 
teria for the trial were households located in the trial catchment area that had at least 1 child 
under 5 years of age. The best estimate of each child’s age was determined by health card, 
insurance card, or caregiver’s report. All caregivers of the participants were informed of their 
right to withdraw from the study at any time. Children of caregivers who declined to partici- 
pate in the surveys were excluded from the study. Study participants were enrolled for 16 
months, and outcome data collection occurred at 6 and 12 months after study initiation. In 
households with more than 1 child, we recruited the youngest child. Children were not cen- 
sored at the following surveys if they became greater than 60 months of age. 

A cluster randomization was chosen to prevent contamination in this study. The community 
level, where people interact with one another most closely, was taken as the randomization 
unit. To minimize the possibility of selection bias, we identified and recruited clusters before 



randomization [16]. Rural communities in the Ketu South District were identified for potential 
participation in the trial. Among the 57 rural communities that were identified, 40 were ran- 
domly selected using probability-proportionate-to-size methods to be included in the trial. In 
the second stage, stratified randomization was used, based on the baseline survey results, to 
assign communities to either intervention or control and reduce the risk of baseline imbal- 
ances. The 40 selected communities were stratified into 8 strata based on the estimated diar- 
rheal prevalence among under-5 children, the economic status of the community, and the 
proportion of caregivers who had skilled delivery for their youngest child. To estimate the 
household economic status of a community, the proportion of housing structures with wattle 
and daub construction was used as a proxy indicator representing low-economic-status com- 
munities (cutoff point: 55.0%). Within the 8 strata, 20 communities were randomly allocated 
to the intervention arm, and 20 to the control arm, using a computer-generated block random- 
ization list (by YM and SC). 

On the basis of a preliminary survey undertaken in 2013, the prevalence of both child diarrhea 
and malaria was estimated to be 25%, and was assumed to be reduced by 25% by the interven- 
tion based on a previous study [6,9,10]. We estimated the coefficient of variation to be 0.16. 
With a 10% attrition rate, the required sample size was 950 households across 20 clusters per 
arm, with a study power of 80% [17]. 

Details of the CHV intervention and characteristics of the CHVs are summarized in S1 Text. 
We incorporated multiple activities into the program that have been recommended to pro- 
mote CHVs’ effectiveness (e.g., training and retraining, selecting CHVs among those most 
respected by the community, household education with visual aids, material rewards as incen- 
tives, regular supervision by health professionals, collaboration with the existing health system, 
and community awareness of CHVs) [3,18]. 
All CHVs’ activities were delivered within the community setting. The CHVs’ core task was 
to carry out home visits to each household every 2 months. They were recommended to spend 
at least 30 minutes on each household visit. While visiting households, CHVs were instructed 
to provide health education based on 10 key messages using visual aids. The messages covered 
actionable recommendations to improve the household members’ knowledge and behavior 
related to maternal and child health. They included information on the prevention of diarrhea 
and malaria, more specifically, that proper handwashing and improved sanitation and hygiene 
can prevent diarrhea, and sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) can prevent 
malaria. CHVs also provided messages about how to manage diarrhea and malaria in children, 
more specifically, that children with diarrhea should be given oral rehydration salts (ORS) and 
taken to a health facility and that suspected malaria cases should be properly diagnosed and 
treated at a health facility. The key messages also included the benefits of using contraceptive 
methods and information on types of contraception, as well as the importance of participating 
in the community outreach program (child welfare clinic). Another major task of CHVs dur- 
ing home visits was to give ORS to children with diarrhea and to perform a malaria test if any 
child had a fever. CHVs were also recommended to support CHNs and to mobilize commu- 
nity members for child welfare clinics that were held monthly in the community. 
After the communities were randomly allocated to the intervention and control arms, 
CHVs were recruited from the intervention communities. The CHV selection process was 
coordinated by the Ketu South District Health Management Team (DHMT) in cooperation 



with community committees. The committees were requested to nominate candidates based 
on their literacy level, volunteerism, and experience. Regional and district health officials 
trained the CHVs for 5 days, including 2 days of field-based training to practice home visit 
skills and outreach support. The content of the training curriculum was prepared through dis- 
cussions among the regional and district health teams and the project team. The objective of 
the CHVs’ training was to help them to understand the concept of CHPS, their roles and 
responsibilities, and essential maternal and child health services. The training also aimed to 
teach skills to properly conduct home visits and provide health education using 10 key mes- 
sages, malaria tests using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), ORS, and referral of patients to their 
supervisor. Refresher training was undertaken every month by the DHMT members and 
CHNs [14]. After the training, community leaders, together with DHMT officials, held com- 
munity meetings to introduce the CHVs and to publicly declare the CHVs’ roles and position. 
The CHVs, who were the implementers of the program, were mainly community-based men 
and women who had graduated from junior high school, and they were rewarded with mate- 
rial compensation in the form of cell phone minutes and food items. CHNs treated patients 
who visited the CHPS compound and undertook community outreach programs to provide 
vaccinations, nutrition, and health education activities on a monthly basis. Community people 
and the project team were not blinded to the intervention because of the distinctive nature of 
CHV home visits. 

Three rounds of household surveys were conducted to evaluate the effect of the CHV program. 
The data collection team consisted of 14 data collectors and 2 supervisors, and all were blinded 
to whether a community was randomized to the intervention or control arm. All data collec- 
tors were trained for 2–3 days before every round of the survey, and participated in daily 
review sessions during the data collection period for quality assurance. The baseline survey 
was conducted from April 18 to May 4, 2015, before the start of the CHV intervention on 
August 15, 2015. The first follow-up survey was administered from February 6, 2016, after 6 
months of intervention, and the end line survey was conducted from September 5, 2016, after 
12 months of intervention. 
A set of questionnaires was developed and used to conduct the survey. The survey instru- 
ment primarily consisted of questions assessing the socioeconomic status of households and 
the prevalence of children’s diarrhea and febrile illness based on caregivers’ reports. Another 
key element was questions on CHVs’ activities reported by caregivers, including the frequency 
and duration of their home visits. The survey also contained a series of questions that gathered 
information about caregivers’ experiences of family planning, such as the use of various types 
of contraceptive methods, as well as information about caregivers’ most recent delivery, such 
as the place of delivery and utilization of antenatal and postnatal care. 

lectors visited households in each community using the interval method, in which the total 
number of households in a community is divided by the cluster size. They started by visiting a 
household located nearest to the main road, from which they continued to visit the next nth 
household based on the interval (e.g., the next fifth household if the interval was 5). Data col- 
lectors asked any household members if they had at least 1 under-5 child. If the household did 
not meet the eligibility criterion of having at least 1 child under 5 years old, the data collectors 
visited the next house and continued visiting the next nth one. At each visited household, the 
primary female caregiver of the youngest child in the household was asked to participate in the 
survey, and signed the consent form for enrollment if she agreed. 




Among the 1,956 households enrolled for impact evaluation, 408 (21%) were randomly 
selected and registered for process evaluation after obtaining separate informed consent for 
this additional survey. The components of the process evaluation were developed based on the 
framework of Steckler and Linnan [19]. Data on the indicators of each step of the intervention 
process were collected through a combination of methods, including household surveys, docu- 
mentation review, and direct observation. Four rounds of household surveys were carried out 
at 3-month intervals. For the sample size, we referred to previous studies [20,21] of process 
evaluation in randomized controlled trials. 

tors. Direct observation accompanied the household surveys for health behaviors such as 
appropriate use of ITNs and proper handwashing. Those who responded that they had used 
ITNs for their child during the previous night at the time of the survey were only considered 
to have actually done so if an ITN was hung up inside their house. For diarrhea, after adminis- 
tering standard questions about caregivers’ handwashing practices in the previous 24 hours at 
the time of the survey, direct observations were made. Only when caregivers were observed to 
wash their hands with running water and soap, upon request of demonstration, were they con- 
sidered to practice appropriate hand hygiene. 

growth checks was surveyed. Among the 10 key messages delivered by the CHVs through 
home visits, we examined which specific messages were recalled by caregivers. In addition, var- 
ious process indicators of intervention fidelity were assessed, including the results of 4 rounds 
of CHVs’ tests, the CHV monthly review meeting attendance rate, the proportion of CHVs 
with regular recording of logbooks, CHVs’ self-reported coverage of home visits, CHVs’ par- 
ticipation in community-wide health activities, and the rate of CHVs’ retention in their duties 
at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. For these indicators, CHVs’ logbooks, monthly review meeting min- 
utes, CHN outreach records, referral records, and the CHPS inventory logs were investigated. 

The primary outcomes of the trial were caregiver report of 14-day diarrhea and fever prevalence 
among under-5 children. Diarrhea was defined as having 3 or more instances of watery stools 
within 24 hours in the past 14 days, and we used febrile episodes in the last 14 days as a proxy 
indicator of malaria prevalence. Family planning practices and case management for child 
diarrhea and fever were investigated as secondary outcomes. For family planning practices, we 
examined long-term and short-term contraceptive methods (i.e., female/male sterilization, intra- 
uterine devices, injectable contraceptives, implants, pills, female/male condoms, the standard- 
days method, the rhythm method, the lactational amenorrhea method, and withdrawal). For 
child diarrhea, we investigated whether the sick child was administered ORS, and for fever, we 
investigated whether the child was tested for malaria with a RDT kit. When designing the trial, 
we planned to examine the effect of the intervention on antenatal and postnatal care, as well as 
on case management of malaria of pregnant women as secondary outcomes. However, effects on 
these outcomes were not analyzed because they were extremely underpowered due to the small 
number of pregnancies in the registered households during the intervention (S3 Table). 
Baseline caregiver, child, and household characteristics were assessed for comparability 
between randomized arms. The statistical analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints 
were based on the intention-to-treat analysis principle. Generalized estimating equations 
(GEEs) with a log link and exchangeable correlation matrix were used to assess the relative risk 
(RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for diarrhea, fever, and secondary outcomes adjusted 



for clustering and stratification. Fixed-effect covariates were used to account for variables used 
in the stratified randomization design. We also conducted sensitivity analyses controlling for 
potential baseline imbalances in factors such as baseline diarrhea or fever prevalence, house- 
hold income quintile, caregivers’ education, child age and sex, access to an improved water 
source, and improved sanitation. If the RR of the baseline-covariate-adjusted model differed 
from that of the unadjusted model by greater than 10%, we presented the adjusted model as 
the primary model. 
In addition, we examined associations of CHVs’ home visit coverage and intensity with pri- 
mary outcomes. We presented observational relationships stratified by coverage (whether 70% 
or more of households received CHV home visits at least once in the past 3 months) and dura- 
tion of visit (whether the average time spent on each home visit in a community was �30 min- 
utes), as well as the combination of these factors. For the coverage and duration of household 
visits, we used caregivers’ reports gathered from household surveys. Due to the observational 
nature of these analyses, the analyses were adjusted for baseline fever or diarrhea, income 
quintile, caregiver education, child sex, and child age. All statistical analyses were conducted 
using STATA version 13. p-Values < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. 
Results 
Baseline characteristics of participants 
Between April and May 2015, 1,970 caregivers of children under 5 years were approached for 
participation in the trial, of whom 1,956 (99.3%) consented and participated in the trial. The 
baseline characteristics of the trial participants, caregivers, and households are presented in 
Table 1. The intervention and control groups appeared to be comparable at baseline. Around 
23% of caregivers had completed primary education, and more than 50% had not, in both 
arms. The mean age of the registered children was 23 months (SD 16), and 51% were male. 
Approximately 64% of households had an improved water source (sachet water, borehole, bot- 
tled water, or public standpipe), and roughly 24% of households had access to improved sani- 
tation (Kumasi Ventilated Improved Pit latrine or flush toilet). 

We followed up participants at 6 and 12 months post-randomization. At 6 months, 1,660 
(85%) had outcomes assessed, and 1,609 (82%) had outcomes assessed at 12 months. The attri- 
tion rate at 12 months was similar between the intervention (17.4%) and control (18.1%) arms. 
Among the 347 randomized participants without outcome data at 12 months, 278 (80.1%) had 
relocated or seasonally migrated out of the study area, 10 (2.9%) caregivers and 14 (4.0%) chil- 
dren had died, and 45 (13.0%) had unknown status (Fig 1). Among the 77 CHVs who were ini- 
tially recruited, 87% were retained until 12 months; the demographic and socioeconomic 
profiles of the CHVs are presented in S1 Text. We found no difference in the characteristics of 
the caregivers and children who were retained in the trial at 6 months and 12 months and 
those who were lost to follow-up (e.g., caregivers’ age or education level, income quintile, 
child’s age or sex, water source, and sanitation status). 

Table 2 presents the effects of CHVs on the primary outcomes of 14-day prevalence of diarrhea 
and fever at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. There was no statistically significant effect of CHVs 
on 14-day diarrhea or fever prevalence at either time point (diarrhea: 6-month RR 0.79, 95% 
CI 0.53–1.15, p = 0.21; 12-month RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37–1.45, p = 0.37; fever: 6-month RR 0.95,

95% CI 0.68–1.33, p = 0.77; 12-month RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51–1.14, p = 0.20). We also found no 
overall effect on the secondary outcomes of family planning, ORS treatment for diarrhea cases, 
or malaria testing for fever cases. These findings were robust in the adjusted analysis, which 
accounted for potential baseline imbalances between intervention and control villages 
(Table 2). In sensitivity analyses, we also found no effect on 14-day diarrhea (RR 0.77, 95% CI 
0.51–1.16, p = 0.21) or fever (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.64–1.18, p = 0.38) prevalence when using a 
longitudinal GEE analysis that included both time points (6 and 12 months of follow-up) in 
the same model (S1 Table). The coefficient of variation of diarrhea at baseline was 0.60. 

Table 3 presents the effect of the CHV intervention on health behaviors. We found significant 
differences in some health behaviors between the intervention and control groups. Caregivers 
in the intervention group were more likely to wash their hands with running water and soap at 
5 critical times than the control group (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.15–1.68, p = 0.001). In addition, 
CHVs had increased utilization of ITNs for under-5 children (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01–1.12, p = 
0.02). The caregivers in the intervention communities also participated more frequently in com- 
munity outreach programs (child welfare clinic) (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06–1.42, p = 0.007). No 
adverse or harmful events with regards to CHV home visits were reported in this study [22].

and cluster levels. The percentage of households that received a CHV visit at least once in the

past 3 months was similar at the 6-month and the 12-month time points—51.5% and 59.2%, 
respectively. The mean duration of the visits declined from 31 minutes to 18 minutes from 6 to 
12 months. Only 2 communities had fully activated CHVs at 6 months, defined as 70% or more 
of households in the cluster reporting that a CHV visited at least once in the past 3 months and 
that the mean length of the visits was 30 minutes or longer. No communities had fully activated 
CHVs at 12 months, primarily due to the decline in visit duration. We also saw that the mean 
number of the 10 key program messages recalled by caregivers in the intervention group 
decreased from 5.3 to 3.8 messages from 6 to 12 months (Table 4). Furthermore, we saw 
declines in key message recall for all of the 10 messages (S2 Table). Other process indicators of 
intervention fidelity are described in S1 Text (i.e., the results of 4 rounds of CHVs’ tests, the 
CHV monthly review meeting attendance rate, the proportion of CHVs with regular recording 
of logbooks, CHVs’ self-reported coverage of home visits, CHVs’ participation in community- 
wide health activities, and the rate of CHVs’ retention in their duties at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months).

duration � 30 minutes, the child diarrheal prevalence was significantly lower than in the con- 
trol group at 6 months (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39–0.99, p = 0.04). Furthermore, communities in 
which the CHV intervention was fully implemented, i.e., with �70% coverage and a mean 
duration of CHV visits � 30 minutes, had significantly lower risks of both diarrhea (RR 0.23, 
95% CI 0.09–0.60, p = 0.003) and fever (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.92, p = 0.01) than the control

Overall, we found no effect of the CHV home visit intervention on 14-day diarrhea and fever 
prevalence at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. In terms of secondary outcomes, the following 
were observed: improved hand hygiene practices, increased utilization of ITNs, and greater 
participation in community outreach programs in the intervention group. There was no effect 
on family planning, ORS treatment for diarrhea cases, or malaria testing for fever cases. We 
found that the coverage of the CHV intervention was suboptimal, and the duration of CHV 
visits declined over time, in tandem with caregivers’ recall of key program messages. In an 
observational subgroup analysis, we found that communities with �70% coverage of the CHV 
intervention and average visits lasting �30 minutes had significantly lower diarrhea and fever 
prevalence than the control communities. 
First, it is important to note that in our study, we found large reductions in child diarrhea 
and fever prevalence over time in both the intervention and control groups over the 12 months 
of follow-up. In the control group, the prevalence of diarrhea and fever from baseline to 12 
months decreased from 20.1% to 7.0% and from 35.2% to 18.4%, respectively. It is impossible 
to determine the specific reasons for this decline, but we hypothesize that it was the result of 
the overall community health program implemented district-wide. The health program sup- 
ported training of CHNs to enhance health promotion in their communities, provision of 
health equipment and commodities, supervisory activities of CHNs with the goal of improving 
the quality of services, and facilitation of community participation in the community outreach 
programs in both the intervention and control areas. These measures might have been effective 
in reducing infectious diseases in children. In addition, intensified DHMT activities to prevent 
a cholera outbreak in the Ketu South District might have contributed to the significant reduc- 
tion of diarrhea prevalence in both arms. There was a cholera outbreak in August 2014, and 
595 cases were reported in the Ketu South District. The Volta Regional Health Directorate 
focused significant attention on the Ketu South District to prevent a new outbreak there and 
to avert the spread of cholera to neighboring districts. Accordingly, the Ketu South DHMT 
enhanced water, sanitation, and hygiene promotion. They started to distribute water purifica- 
tion tablets throughout the district after we launched the intervention, and also encouraged 
CHNs and community health officers (CHOs) to prioritize health education on water, sanita- 
tion, and hygiene during the community outreach program. Particularly, the DHMT

emphasized the importance of boiling drinking water and food hygiene. In Togo, which bor- 
ders Ghana along the Ketu South District, a cholera outbreak was reported in 2015 and 2016, 
which caused the Ketu South District to continue prioritizing water, sanitation, and hygiene 
promotion. 
According to a recent systematic review, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Streptococcus 
pneumonia were the main pathogens of non-malaria febrile episodes among under-5 children 
in sub-Saharan Africa between 1990 and 2015, and some of those microbes are infectious 
agents of diarrhea [23]. We thus infer that the reduction in febrile episodes in both groups 
partly resulted from a reduction in infections with non-malarial agents, some of which are 
causative agents of both diarrhea and fever. We provided material incentives to all the respon- 
dents (e.g., soaps for the baseline survey and foodstuffs for the first and second follow-up sur- 
veys) to encourage them to actively participate in the survey, and we minimized the number of 
questions in our modified version of the Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indi- 
cator Cluster Survey questionnaires to avoid respondent fatigue. Throughout the intervention 









































































period, households that reported diarrhea were given ORS and those that reported fever were 
tested for malaria, so we do not consider it likely that the respondents severely underreported 
diarrhea and fever in their children. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of a biased 
downward trend over time due to reporter fatigue over repeated measurements. During the 
course of follow-up, the registered children aged, and thus their diarrhea risk might have 
changed, which could be another reason for diarrheal reduction over time. We do not consider 
seasonal variation to have been a likely reason since the baseline and second follow-up surveys 
were both conducted during the same season (the rainy season). Likewise, we consider inter- 
observer bias between surveys to be a less likely explanation for our findings because the same 
group of data collectors was maintained throughout the survey. Our trial assumed a 25% prev- 
alence of diarrhea and fever in the control group, and therefore it was likely underpowered to 
detect small to moderate effects. 
Nevertheless, we found that the CHV intervention resulted in non-statistically significant 
reductions of 26% and 23% in diarrhea and fever prevalence at 12 months, which are in line 
with a recent meta-analysis of the effect of CHWs on child morbidity (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75– 
0.99) [6]. In addition, we found in an observational analysis that communities exposed to 
greater-intensity CHV intervention in terms of both duration and frequency of home visits at 
6 months had significantly lower rates of diarrhea and fever than the control villages. These 
results suggest that the CHV intervention may reduce fever and diarrhea and that maintaining 
the fidelity of the intervention in terms of community coverage and duration of home visits is 
central to produce beneficial effects. Our findings that intervention fidelity and intensity mod- 
ify the effect of the CHV intervention are similar to the results of a trial of CHWs and partici- 
patory women’s groups in India [9], where there was no overall effect of the intervention on 
child length-for-age z-scores or self-reported morbidity, but there was some indication of a 
greater effect among those exposed to higher-intensity interventions. As a result, it is essential 
to conduct research on how to best motivate and potentially incentivize unsalaried CHVs to 
reach and sustain high effective coverage of home visits. 
The achieved coverage of CHV home visits at the community level was lower than we 
expected in the design stage, but it was similar to that of previous studies [10,24,25]. The pro- 
portion of the target population who had received a CHV home visit at least once in the previ- 
ous 3 months was about 50%–60% throughout the study. The CHVs’ work burden in this trial 
design in terms of the minimum frequency and time of home visits was lower than in some 
other contexts [26,27] where a household typically received a 1-hour visit from a CHW every 
week or every other week. However, we had to reduce the work burden, taking into account 
the possibility of nationwide scaling up on a voluntary basis, since a high workload for CHWs 
is known to result in poor performance or lower motivation [28,29]. Still, the low coverage in 
this trial indicates that even this reduced home visit package was burdensome to CHVs, who 
likely had competing demands for income generation and family care. Similarly, the reduced 
duration of the home visits from 6 to 12 months also indicates that CHVs may have been los- 
ing their enthusiasm for the program over time, which could be explained by the lack of a 
monetary incentive system and their high work burden [3,4,18]. A previous study [24] stressed 
that if a CHV program is sustained, the loss of intensity will be compensated by repeated 
household visits with the passage of time. Stepwise capacity building of caregivers through 
multiple exposures to key messages by CHVs was the rationale for this argument [30]. How- 
ever, we found that duration of the visit, and not the coverage, appeared to be important to 
produce benefit, and this raises the concern that merely exposing community members to 
more frequent visits might have no effect, even if the intervention continues. Reducing the 
CHV-to-population ratio [28,31] may allow CHVs to spend more time at each household. 



This study also underscores the potential importance of optimizing the number of key mes- 
sages to avoid message dilution. Indeed, a number of caregivers could not recall the full length 
of the messages they had received at both 6 and 12 months. Caregivers generally recalled 3 to 5 
of the 10 key messages. Ghanaian policy states that CHWs must deliver comprehensive mes- 
sages. Based on the findings of this study, 5 messages or fewer at each visit might be optimal 
for community members to recall; however, this issue warrants further study. It may not be 
effective for CHVs to deliver all the messages at every visit. Developing distinct sets of 5 or 
fewer key messages could be an alternative approach, enabling CHVs to deliver 1 set of mes- 
sages during a certain time period, and when the awareness of people reaches a sufficient level 
communitywide, they could move on to the next set of messages. Having fewer messages may 
relieve the workload of CHVs and ultimately improve their performance. Gilmore and McAu- 
liffe [11] argued that simple and targeted messages could improve the effectiveness of CHWs’ 
performance in health education. The importance of having CHVs equipped with communi- 
cation and counseling skills cannot be overemphasized. 
Our study has some limitations. As discussed previously, the trial may have been under- 
powered to detect small to moderate effects due to the large decline in diarrheal and fever prev- 
alence in both the intervention and control group that was likely due to external factors. In 
addition, the possibility of information diffusion or spillover between the intervention and 
control groups cannot be ruled out. We documented that ~10% of households in the control 
communities reported receiving a CHV home visit every 3 months; however, caregivers may 
be misreporting CHN visits, which occurred in all study communities. In addition, this trial 
followed up participants for 1 year after the intervention, and therefore we were not able to 
investigate the longer-term effects of CHVs. In addition, caregivers’ practices were based on 
self-report, and as a result, the possibility of caregivers providing socially desirable responses 
or repeating key messages of the CHV program without implementing them cannot be 
excluded. Nevertheless, to minimize reporting bias, we also undertook direct observation of 
hygiene practices and mosquito net utilization. 

examining the prevalence of malaria in remote rural areas where diagnostic tests are hard to 
access [2,32]. We designed this study to use febrile illness as a proxy indicator of malaria preva- 
lence instead of diagnostic test results. According to the World Malaria Report 2018 by the 
World Health Organization, only a median of 52% of children with fever were reported to 
have been taken to a trained provider (i.e., to public sector health facilities, CHWs, or formal 
private health facilities), and a median of 40% of febrile children had not been taken to receive 
any form of care in 2015–2017 in 18 sub-Saharan Africa countries [2]. Among the children 
brought for care, 49% received a malaria diagnostic test (a finger or heel stick test) [2]. Our 
study also showed that only 21%–42% of children with febrile illness received an RDT for 
malaria, suggesting that diagnostic test results are not an adequate indicator of malaria 
prevalence. 
However, febrile episodes also have limitations as an indicator of malaria prevalence. First, 
the symptoms of malarial fever are nonspecific [23]. The proportion of children with malaria 
among those with fever was reported to range from �10% to �70% in 2015–2017 in sub-Saha- 
ran Africa [33]. Similarly, Murphy and Breman estimated that only 30%–60% of children with 
fevers in Africa were actually infected with malaria [34]. Another limitation is recall bias. 
Fevers on the previous day at the time of the survey were more likely to be recalled than those 
that occurred a few days prior to the survey [35,36]. 
The first round of the survey to measure process indicators was conducted 3 months after 
the start of intervention implementation. Therefore, we suggest that the somewhat high per- 
centage of healthy behaviors in handwashing, ITN use, and participation in the community 



outreach program at 3 months in part resulted from the program intervention. The baseline val- 
ues of health behaviors were not assessed in the survey, and therefore were not adjusted for. 
Regardless of treatment allocation, CHNs, CHOs, and Community Health Management Com- 
mittee (CHMC) members were trained in intervention delivery during the early period of the 
intervention. CHNs and CHOs are the frontline staff of Ghana’s health system based at health 
facilities and carrying out community outreach programs. Health education such as promoting 
handwashing and mosquito net utilization are the key components of community outreach pro- 
grams. CHMC members are residents of their respective communities whose roles are to mobilize 
community members in community outreach programs and to advocate for health promotion, 
helping CHNs and CHOs. Not assessing process indicators at baseline is a limitation of this study 
because we cannot rule out the possibility of residual imbalance after randomization. 
Unlike previous studies [37,38] conducted in Ghana, our findings suggest that CHVs may 
exert a beneficial effect on behaviors related to child health with high community coverage and 
regular household contacts of effective duration. Ghanaian health policy [39] articulates that it 
is mainly CHNs’ role to make home visits for counseling or health education. However, it may 
not be feasible for CHNs to conduct home visits on a regular basis, considering the large benefi- 
ciary population per CHN and logistical issues, such as the lack of transportation and the 
CHNs’ main role of caring for patients at CHPS health facilities. This study demonstrates the 
potential impact of CHVs in complementing CHNs’ critical tasks, to address the enormous 
shortage of the health workforce in Ghana and similar settings. Implementing CHV programs 
in a way that ensures frequent home visits of effective duration may prevent infectious diseases 
in children and contribute to achievement of global health and development goals.
