ABSTRACT 
This paper analyzes a randomized experiment that uses novel strategies to promote handwashing with soap at critical points 
in time in Peru. It evaluates a large-scale comprehensive initiative that involved both community and school activities in 
addition to communication campaigns. The analysis indicates that the initiative was successful in reaching the target audi- 
ence and in increasing the treated population’s knowledge about appropriate handwashing behavior. These improvements 
translated into higher self-reported and observed handwashing with soap at critical junctures. However, no signiﬁcant im- 
provements in the health of children under the age of 5 years were observed. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 






Handwashing with soap is generally easy and relatively cheap, and the medical evidence of its beneﬁts is con- 
clusive (signiﬁcant reduction in diarrhea and respiratory illnesses in children). 
1However, only 3 to 34% of the population in developing countries routinely washes their hands with soap 
at critical junctures during the day. Therefore, the main challenge is to ﬁnd an efﬁcient way to bring about a 
behavioral change towards better hygiene practices. This paper documents a study of a large-scale 
handwashing promotion campaign carried out in Peru between 2008 and 2010 that introduced an innovative 
mix of communication strategies designed to induce handwashing with soap at critical points in time. Efforts 
to change handwashing behavior involve dealing with a complex matrix of personal habits that have multiple 
economic, cultural, social, and other determinants. A handwashing campaign will be effective if it can provide 
a ‘nudge’2 by giving people information about 
the positive (and usually underestimated) effects of 
handwashing habits and achieving a behavioral change towards increased handwashing at critical times. 
We analyze the Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project in Peru, a large-scale initiative that aims to con- 
vince mothers, caregivers and children up to 12 years of age in rural households to wash their hands with soap

at critical points in time. The results of this evaluation show that these community district-level interventions 
were effective in reaching the targeted audience with handwashing promotional messages. The community- 
level treated group was 19.4% more likely to report having received the intervention messages through at least 
one communication channel than the control group. Handwashing campaigns and promotional events at the 
community level and one-to-one activities seemed to have successfully communicated the importance of 
handwashing with soap. Not only did the message reach the treated population but it also brought about a 
6% improvement in caregivers’ knowledge about the best way to wash hands and increased the availability 
of soap and water in the household by 8.4%. These improvements led to a statistically signiﬁcant increase in 
self-reported and observed handwashing with soap before food contact as compared with the behavior of the 
control groups. However, this change in behavior did not translate into better child health. No signiﬁcant im- 
pact was found on parasite or bacterial prevalence in stools and drinking water (respectively); this is consistent 
with the ﬁnding that there were no treatment effects in terms of diarrhea, nutrition or anemia.3 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the program components. In Section 3, we 
explain the experimental design. Section 4 describes relevant issues concerning the data and sampling proce- 
dure. Section 5 describes the results of the baseline balance checks and of the panel sample attrition. 
Section 6 describes the methodological framework. In Section 7, we present and interpret the main results of 
the study. Section 8 concludes. 

The Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project implemented in Peru borrowed from commercial and social mar- 
keting techniques to promote better hygiene. Communication campaigns and messages developed for this pro- 
ject were designed and strategically delivered across multiple integrated channels and in various settings in 
order to ‘surround’ target audiences with handwashing promotional messages. Formative research conducted 
in 2007 demonstrated that hand soap was not available to mothers and caregivers in most households in Peru, 
that there was a common belief that washing hands only with water was sufﬁcient, and that people did not know 
what the critical times for washing their hands with soap were.4 
The project was implemented in a total of approximately 800 districts randomly selected (in 104 provinces) 
across the country. Its primary target audience consisted of mothers of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) and care- 
givers for children under 12 years of age. The project’s objective was to improve handwashing behavior among the 
target audience in order to improve speciﬁcally the health of children under 5 years. These infections are usually 
transferred from dirty hands to food or water sources or by direct contact with the mouth. Diarrheal disease and 
respiratory infection among children under 5 years of age can be prevented if their mothers/caregivers wash their 
hands with soap at critical times, such as before feeding a child, cooking, or eating. 
The intervention comprised two main components that were delivered at different administrative levels: a 
mass media campaign at the province level and a more comprehensive district-level community treatment that 
included, in addition to media campaigns, training of community agents; capacity-building for mothers, care- 
givers, and children; and the inclusion of handwashing promotion as part of primary school curricula. In this 
paper, we focus solely on the district-level intervention, which not only had a better experimental design (be- 
cause both treatment and control communities were randomized in the same provinces), but, more importantly, 
also points to a low-cost way of scaling up proven intensive strategies that are effective but not cost-effective.5 
The community intervention was conducted at the district level and consisted of the following:6

We carried out a controlled randomized trial at the district-level while taking into consideration the general 
community treatment and its school component. The targeted areas were districts with populations ranging 
from 1500 to 100,000 inhabitants. Figure 1 illustrates the experiment’s design. From the 1937 provinces, 40 
were randomly selected to participate in the evaluation of the district-level interventions. From these provinces, 
85 districts (with between 1500 and 100,000 inhabitants) were randomly selected, with 44 randomly assigned 
to receive the district-level community treatment and the other 41 randomly assigned to serve as the control 
group.8 In addition, for the 44 districts that were randomly assigned to the community treatment, the main 
school in each district was selected to receive the school treatment. To create a counterfactual for the subgroup 
of households with children attending the main school in the treated districts, we also chose a subsample clus- 
tered around the main schools in the districts of the control group to serve as a control group for the school 
intervention.9 
In what follows, we will refer to the households that were used to explore the community treatment as the 
community sample and to the households used to investigate the school component of the community treatment 
as the school sample. 

The baseline survey was held from May through August 2008 and covered a total of 3576 households. The 
follow-up survey was conducted following the completion of the project activities (March–June 2011). We lo- 
cated 2847 of the original households interviewed for the baseline survey during the follow-up round. We re- 
placed the households that we could not ﬁnd with new households that ﬁt the following criteria: the family had 
lived in the dwelling for at least the 2 preceding years (e.g., when the intervention took place) and included a 
child who was under 2 years of age at the time of the baseline survey. 
For the household-level sampling, in each district allocated to treatment and control groups, we target to ran- 
domly select between 15 and 20 households from a census conducted prior to our baseline survey that listed all 
households with children under 2 years of age. From the districts assigned to the community treatment, we also 
target to randomly select an additional set of from 15 to 20 households with children under 2 years of age and 
with at least one sibling who attended the main treated schools in each district, so that we could assess the effect 
of the school subcomponent of the district-level intervention. To serve as a counterfactual for this last group, in 
each of the districts allocated to the control group, we target to randomly select a second set of from 15 to 20 
households with children under 2 years of age and with at least one sibling who attended a school similar to the 
main treated school in the treatment districts. 
7The province of Pisco was excluded because an earthquake had just hit the area. The province of Lima was excluded because most of its 
districts are too large for this type of intervention and its inhabitants are relatively wealthy. 
8Note that, because every district had the same probability of being selected for the evaluation, small, poor districts were overrepresented in 
the sample. This was desired, however, because the program was targeting poor sectors of the population. 
9Districts were assigned with replacements in case fewer households were found in the originally selected districts. Thus, during the data 
collection process, a district was randomly added in the ‘Control School’ arm of the study.

Data were collected from different sources. First, a comprehensive household survey was conducted that pro- 
vided information on dwelling characteristics, household assets, education, income, labor outcomes, water 
sources, sanitation, and toilet and handwashing facilities, and so on (see the online Appendix 1 in Galiani 
et al. (2014) for the complete list). Also included were questions on exposure to handwashing campaigns, 
determinants of handwashing behavior—handwashing knowledge, beliefs, and access to and placement of soap 
and water—and caregiver self-reported handwashing behavior. To complement the handwashing behavior 
module, structured observations, during which a family’s handwashing behavior within the household was 
observed for a period lasting from 4 to 5 h, were conducted on another day following the survey.10 In addition, 
in order to measure environmental contamination, drinking water microbiology samples were collected inside 
the households at the time of the survey and analyzed in the ﬁeld using a membrane ﬁltration technique to 
determine the presence of Escherichia coli and other types of coliforms. 
We were interested in symptoms directly or indirectly related to poor handwashing habits. We asked about 
diarrhea and Acute Lower Respiratory Infections (ALRI) prevalence in the last 48 h and in the last week and 
illnesses mainly transmitted through the hands. We also performed anthropometric measurements of children 
following standard international procedures. An assessment of the presence of intestinal parasitic infestations 
in children was achieved through a laboratory analysis of children’s stools. Parasitic infestations pose serious 
threats to young children’s health because the associated diarrhea and micronutrient malnutrition often lead 
to iron-deﬁciency anemia.11 We therefore also measured anemia in children between 6 months and 5 years 
of age. 

Peru is a middle-income country with an estimated per capita income of $US5195 in 2010. Peru has a high 
human development index score of 0.725 based on 2011 data (the average index for Latin America and the

Caribbean is 0.731 and for the world is 0.682). One-third of the population is poor (31.3%), and 9.8% is ex- 
tremely poor. The wealthiest region of the country is Lima, Peru’s capital city, which is excluded from this 
study. The mean years of schooling for adults older than 25 is 8.9. Most children attend school (93% attend 
primary school, and 76% attend high school) according to 2010 data. 
Our baseline survey results indicate that the households covered by the survey have an average of 5.6 mem- 
bers, with 1.45 children under the age of 5 years. Around 90% of household heads had completed their primary 
education, 30% had a secondary education, and most (95%) were employed. The population included in the 
study was poorer, on average, than the general population of Peru, because poverty is concentrated in the smaller 
districts and because we restricted our sample to families that had at least one child under 2 years of age. 
Three-quarters of the households had access to improved sources of drinking water, and over 40% of the 
households had improved sanitation. More than 20% of all households had no sanitation facilities of any type. 
The habit of washing hands with soap was not prevalent among the interviewed households. Although almost 
all caregivers reported having washed their hands with soap at least once during the previous 24 h, fewer than 
half conﬁrmed having carried out so at times of fecal contact (39% of caregivers associated handwashing with 
soap with toilet use and 34% with cleaning up after children). Self-reported handwashing-with-soap was 
higher at times of cooking or food preparation (68%), but lower when feeding a child (31%). The rate of struc- 
tured observations of the use of soap was substantially lower than self-reported rates. Handwashing with soap 
was observed in only 16% of the events that required it. For instance, handwashing with soap was observed in 
only 20% of fecal contact events, 25% of eating events, 6% of child feeding events, and 10% of food prep- 
aration events. 
In 60% of the households, a handwashing facility—a designated place for handwashing—stocked with soap 
and water was observed within the dwelling or the yard. The higher the income, the closer the handwashing 
station was to the toilet or kitchen facility. In all, 44% of the caregivers appeared to have clean ﬁngernails, 
and approximately 56% had clean hands or ﬁnger pads, whereas 66% of the children looked clean at ﬁrst sight, 
but 55% had dirty ﬁngernails. Households with access to improved sanitation and water sources had lower 
counts of bacteria in their drinking water. When accounting for income levels, there was a declining trend of 
E. coli counts with increased income.12 
Parasitological analysis shows that, on average, parasites were detected in 15% of the stool samples col- 
lected from children under 2 years of age (the most frequent were Giardia and Blastocystis). The prevalence 
of parasites was lower among households with access to improved sanitation (9%) and water (14%) than 
those with unimproved sanitation (20%) or unimproved water (21%). The lowest prevalence of parasites 
was found in households with a handwashing station stocked with soap and water (8%) and highest in those 
without (25%). 
In all, 9% of children under the age of 5 years were reported by their caregivers to have had diarrheal symp- 
toms in the previous 48 h, and another 15% were reported to have had such symptoms in the past 7 days. The 
prevalence of diarrhea was greater in households with unimproved sanitation (9%) and slightly lower in those 
with improved sanitation (8%); however, the prevalence of diarrhea was not signiﬁcantly lower in households 
with access to a handwashing station equipped with soap and water or in households with access to improved 
water sources than it was in those without access to those facilities. The prevalence of diarrhea appeared to be 
uncorrelated with income, but it varied noticeably by geographic location. On average, 4% of children had pre- 
sented ALRI symptoms in the previous 48 h and 5.5% in the preceding 7 days. ALRI prevalence increased for 
children living in households with unimproved sanitation and those with unimproved water sources. As with 
diarrhea, similar percentages of households had presented ALRI symptoms in the previous 7 days, irrespective 
of whether or not they had a handwashing station stocked with soap and water. In addition, three-quarters of the 
12For a subsample of 159 households, we also analyzed samples from sources other than drinking water. Households with access to im- 
proved sanitation also presented lower bacterial counts in the water used to rinse hands and for sentinel objects. Water and caregivers’ 
handrinsed samples from households with a handwashing station equipped with soap and water had lower bacterial counts.

samples taken from children below 2 years of age pointed to the presence of anemia (the proportion was 
slightly lower for households with improved sanitation). 
Finally, the average child was breastfed for 12 months, but half of all caregivers gave their children instant 
formula during the ﬁrst 3 days of life. Vitamin A was given to 35% of the children and iron supplements to 
23%. On average, children living in dwellings without improved sanitation, an improved water source, or soap 
and water at a handwashing station tended to have a lower average Z-score for each anthropometric measure- 
ment included in the analysis. 


In Online Appendix 2 in Galiani et al. (2014), we present the mean comparison tests13 across treatment/control 
groups for an exhaustive set of variables included in the baseline survey. We compare the characteristics of 
households allocated to each treatment with the households of the corresponding control groups. 
The proportion of unbalanced variables for the treatment and control comparison for the district-level inter- 
vention was in line with the levels considered acceptable in randomized trials. Furthermore, the differences be- 
tween treatment and control groups go in either direction without any clear pattern. 

Our surveys records show an overall attrition rate of 20% after 3 years, in line with similar randomized stud- 
ies.14 In addition to the fact that the sample is smaller, when attrition is systematically related to the outcomes 
under study or to the program itself, it may skew the estimates of the causal effects of the interventions. 
To address this potential problem, we ﬁrst show in Online Appendix 3 in Galiani et al. (2014) that the pro- 
portion of households that stayed in each group ranges from 0.72 to 0.804, and we cannot reject the null hy- 
pothesis of equal levels of attrition for the control and treatment groups at conventional signiﬁcance levels in 
any of the samples studied. 
The fact that there was no differential attrition in the treatment and comparison groups is consistent with the 
hypothesis that attrition could be ignorable, and it suggests that the estimate of the treatment effects will not be 
biased unless different types of households dropped out of the sample in the treatment and the comparison 
groups.15 Baseline balance was achieved for the entire initial sample in most of the variables, and in Online 
Appendix 3 in Galiani et al. (2014), we can see that the sample of non-attriters is also well balanced at baseline. 
This implies that those remaining in the sample and the attriters were statistically balanced in terms of observ- 
able characteristics. 
To make up for the loss in sample size due to attrition, we included 688 new households in the follow-up 
survey to replace households that had dropped out. Note that this poses no problem so long as the intervention 
is at the area level rather than at the individual level, assuming that attrition is statistically ignorable. To conﬁrm 
that the characteristics of the replacement households in the treatment and control groups were balanced, we 
selected 32 variables that were presumably independent of the treatment and affected by more structural pat- 
terns. In most of these cases, we could not reject the null hypothesis of equality of means at conventional sig- 
niﬁcance levels (see Online Appendix 3 in Galiani et al. (2014)). 
13The standard errors used in these tests were clustered at the district level, allowing for the possibility of an intra-district correlation. 
14For example, Banerjee et al. (2007) ﬁnd attrition rates of 17% and 18%, respectively, in the comparison and treatment groups in Vadodara

The treatment assignment in this study was random, and as discussed in Section 5, the randomization produced 
comparable groups in terms of observables for all the groups studied. Furthermore, the discussion in the previ- 
ous section also suggests that attrition is unlikely to bias the estimator of the parameters of interest. Therefore, 
in the context of this randomized experiment, we can assess the average intention to treatment effect on the out- 
comes of interest by estimating the following simple regression model: 


where i indexes households or individuals and j indexes districts; Y is any of the outcomes under study; T is the 
dummy variable indicating treatment assignment (equal to 1 for units in treated groups); γ is the parameter of 
interest, which captures the causal effect of the intervention considered on the outcome of interest (Y); X is a 
vector of control variables; and ε is the error term. Because the intervention is at the area level, we refer to 
the parameter of interest as the intention-to-treat effect of the program on the outcomes of interest. We estimate 
robust standard errors clustered at the district level throughout the analysis. 
The X vector comprises the following control variables: gender and education of the head of household, 
dummy variables for children’s ages in months, gender of the children, an indicator variable for the mother liv- 
ing in the home, rainfall16 (at the district level), and geographical dummies for the region concerned (jungle, 
coast, and mountain). 
For the results presented in the main text of the paper, we also follow Kling et al. (2007) to construct sum- 
mary indexes by family group of outcome variables in the analysis. These summary indexes, aggregating infor- 
mation across related outcomes, are not only useful summary statistics but might also improve the statistical 
power to detect effects of the intervention that are consistent across groups of outcomes when they have idio- 
syncratic variation. We ﬁrst impute missing values using the mean of the settlement by intention-to-treat status. 
Then, we standardize each outcome variable by subtracting the mean value of the control group and by dividing 
by its standard deviation. Finally, the summary index is computed as the sum of standardized outcome variables 
in the group, with the sign of each measure oriented so that more beneﬁcial outcomes have higher scores di- 
vided by the number of outcome variables. 
The results presented throughout the paper are estimates of model (1) and are generally robust to two 
alternative models: dropping all the control variables and dropping only the geographical dummies. Online Ap- 
pendix 4 in Galiani et al. (2014) presents the results for the three model speciﬁcations as robustness checks. 

In this section, we present the results for the relevant outcomes of the hypothesized causal chain: exposure to 
handwashing promotion, effects on handwashing determinants (handwashing knowledge and beliefs 
and access to and placement of soap and water), handwashing behavior (self-reported and observed 
handwashing and hand cleanliness), environmental contamination (bacterial prevalence in drinking water), 
and child health (prevalence of diarrhea, ALRI, anemia, parasites in stools, nutrition, and anthropometric 
measurements).17 
We are also interested in studying the effect of the school handwashing curricula component, which is part 
of the community intervention, separately. Thus, in Tables I–V, the heading ‘community treatment sample’ re- 
fers to the sample of households used to explore the effects of the comprehensive community treatment, while 
16Rainfall is measured as the maximum rainfall per district, on average, for January, February, March and April 2011.

the heading ‘school component sample’ refers to the households that were sampled in order to investigate the 
community treatment’s school component. In the remainder of the paper, we will use school component and 
school treatment interchangeably. 

The Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project in Peru uses a behavior-change approach. Thus, we asked 
mothers and caregivers whether they had received handwashing promotional messages during the past 12 
months through any of the three channels used by the intervention: radio and printed materials, promotional 
events, and educational sessions. 
The intervention was successful in exposing the target audience to the handwashing-with-soap message. The 
proportion of mothers or caregivers who reported having received handwashing messages through at least one

(two) of the communications channels was 15.7% (33.5%) higher in the intention-to-treat group than in the 
non-intention-to-treat group.18 
We are also interested in assessing whether the messages imparted at schools reached the children who were 
in attendance, even though those children and their mothers/caregivers might also have been exposed to the 
other community-level activities. Table I shows that the school component increased the probability of low ex- 
posure to the treatment (that is, receiving the messages through only one channel) by 8.9%. 

In order to improve handwashing behavior, the factors that motivate that behavior have to be changed. These 
factors are known as handwashing determinants, and they include knowledge about the best way to wash 
hands, beliefs about whether soap is needed for effective handwashing, and the availability and placement of 
soap and water. Caregivers were asked about their knowledge of effective handwashing habits as well as the 
availability of water or soap in the household. This would constitute the second link—after exposure to infor- 
mation—in determining whether the project could trigger a behavioral change. 
Table II also shows that the district-level interventions not only increased exposure to the treatment but also 
enhanced the knowledge of mothers and caregivers regarding handwashing practices. For instance, in the 
treated districts, there was a signiﬁcant increase (around 5%) in the proportion of respondents who answered 
that the best method for washing their hands was to use water and soap. In addition, the members of 3.3% more 
households in the treated districts knew that insufﬁcient handwashing is the main cause of diarrhea.19 
It is important to note that the mean of the control group for these knowledge variables is high: 88% of the 
caregivers answered that the best method for washing hands is with water and soap, and 94% of the inter- 
viewees claimed that improper handwashing is the main cause of diarrhea. These variables reﬂect a fairly mod- 
est gap of 12 and 6 percentage points, respectively, relative to total knowledge. If we measure the effectiveness 
of the community intervention in closing the knowledge gap, we can see that the program reduced this gap by 
as much as 50% (the gap in terms of the level of knowledge regarding the best method for washing hands was 
reduced by 42%, and the gap regarding the inﬂuence of improper or insufﬁcient handwashing as a cause of di- 
arrhea was reduced by 50%).20 
Finally, the community treatment increased the availability of water and soap in households by 8.4% 
(among the school component sample). Again, it is worth mentioning that the level of availability of soap 
and water anywhere in the dwelling was also quite high in the control group (e.g., 77% of the households in 
the control group for the school component of the community treatment have water and soap somewhere in 
the dwelling). Thus, the treatment reduced the gap by 28%, which constitutes remarkable progress. 
7.3. Treatment effects on handwashing behavior 
The next step in the causal chain is to assess whether the improvements in knowledge about the beneﬁts of 
handwashing and the availability of water and soap brought about by the community treatment translated into 
behavioral changes in handwashing. Ideally, multiple methods should be used to obtain a more reliable mea- 
surement of true handwashing behavior because respondents tend to over-report their behavior if they think 
18Note, however, that the control group also reports high levels of exposure to similar messages. Although this might largely reﬂect mea- 
surement error, it might also reﬂect the fact that other, less intensive campaigns could have been implemented elsewhere and/or that some 
radio messages in treatment areas also reached some control areas even though the implementers of the intervention took special care to 
forestall this type of situation; see also footnote 18. 
19We also conducted a before and after comparison among both control groups for these two outcome variables (best method to wash hands 
and not washing hands with soup is main cause of diarrhea) in order to evaluate whether the self-reported exposure to handwashing in- 
formation by the control group correlated with their behavioral change and did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant change.

handwashing with soap is the right thing to do. This study uses four different measurement methods, along with 
proxies that vary in their degree of validity, reliability, and cost, to obtain accurate rates of handwashing.21 
These measurements include observations of handwashing facilities in the households, cleanliness of care- 
givers’ hands, self-reported handwashing with soap, and direct structured observations of handwashing. 
Table III summarizes the results for these four metrics.

Observations of handwashing facilities were conducted in all households. The mother or caregiver was 
asked to identify the place(s) in the household that were designated for handwashing after fecal contact or be- 
fore food contact. When the answer was positive, the enumerator noted all the details about the handwashing 
facility (type, distance from the toilet or kitchen, availability of water and soap, and type of soap). At baseline, 
the proportion of households with at least one handwashing facility near the toilet or kitchen was quite high 
(66%). The community treatment increased the share of households with handwashing facilities by 4.9% 
(9.2% for the school component sample), but the increase was not statistically signiﬁcant at conventional levels. 
The enumerators also observed the hands of mothers and caregivers and recorded the cleanliness of their nails, 
palms, and ﬁnger pads. These observations were used to create a hand cleanliness index.22 The intervention had 
a positive and signiﬁcant effect on the cleanliness of mothers’ hands, as the treatment group was 3.6% more 
likely to have clean hands than those in the control group. 
Self-reported handwashing behavior was measured by asking mothers and caregivers under what 
circumstances they had washed their hands with soap in the previous 24 h. Respondents were asked to 
recall every time that they had used soap during handwashing. Analysis of the responses focused on 
self-reported handwashing-with-soap behavior during any of the critical junctures. As Table III shows, 
self-reported handwashing-with-soap behavior improved in the district-level interventions at almost all 
the critical junctures, but it was statistically signiﬁcant only in the school treatment. Among the school 
component sample, 23.6% more respondents in the treatment group reported having washed their hands 
with soap before eating, and 27.8% more reported having washed their hands with soap before feeding 
a child, relative to the control group. 
In order to triangulate the results, the study included structured observations of handwashing in a subsample 
of 600 households; direct observations were conducted in the school component and its control group during a 
4-h to 5-h period on the day after the main questionnaire was administered. The enumerators observed events 
that should be followed by handwashing and recorded whether the caregiver had actually washed his or her 
hands, the time of the event, whether water and soap were used, whether hands were dried and, if so, what 
intervention had a signiﬁcant and large effect on observed 
was used to dry them. The district-level 
handwashing at two of the four main critical junctures. Sixty-one percent more household members in the treat- 
ment group washed their hands with soap before eating than those in the control group. Similarly, members of 
treated households were 69% more likely to wash their hands before food preparation than non-treated 
22The hand cleanliness index comprises the following components: (a) Nails: +1 if visibly dirty, +2 if apparently dirty, +3 if clean; (b) 
Palms: +1 if visibly dirty, +2 if apparently dirty, +3 if clean; and (c) Finger pads: +1 if visibly dirty, +2 if apparently dirty, +3 if clean. 
The index ranges from ratings of from 3 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater cleanliness.

households (Table III). There is a possible caveat regarding the results of the structured observations, as indi- 
viduals may have changed their behavior because they were being observed ( Clasen et al., 2012, for example). 
In the context of this handwashing campaign, that type of change in behavior could be occurring in both the 
control and the treatment groups. However, rates of handwashing with soap as measured by structured obser- 
vations are substantially lower than self-reported rates, so, by this measure, there does not seem to be any sub- 
stantial degree of over-reaction to the presence of an observer. What could, however, bias our causal estimates 
would be a situation in which the treated group would react differently to the observer’s presence than the con- 
trol group would, but still our results would conﬁrm that the members of the treated group had received the 
messages and knew when to wash their hands with soap. 

Medical evidence suggests that the transmission of diarrhea and respiratory infections occurs mainly through 
people’s hands. It is expected that people who wash their hands with soap at key junctures will have fewer

bacteria such as E. coli or total coliforms on their hands, thereby reducing the risk of contamination when han- 
dling, preparing, or serving drinking water at home. Thus, the study collected samples of drinking water23 from 
a subsample of 600 households in the school component sample and its control group. Consistent with previous 
results, the microbiological analysis of drinking water samples summarized in Table IV shows that the preva- 
lence of E. coli and of total coliforms was lower in the treated households than in those of the control group, but 
none of the effects are statistically signiﬁcant at conventional levels. 
7.5. Treatment effects on child health 
The last step in the causal chain is to assess whether the positive results generated by exposure to the campaign— 
knowledge of appropriate handwashing practices, access to soap and water, and handwashing with soap—resulted 
in health improvements. Table V shows that, overall, none of the treatments had a signiﬁcant effect on those variables. 
For the district-level intervention, the improvements in terms of knowledge and behavioral change do not 
seem to have resulted in better health for the children concerned. There are no statistically signiﬁcant differences 
between the prevalence of diarrhea or ALRI among children in treated households and those in groups that were 
not treated, although one should also note that the prevalence levels of these outcomes are not high in the control 
groups (much lower than at baseline). Nor do we observe any major improvement in anthropometric measure- 
ments24 or anemia indicators. The prevalence of parasites and the parasite counts obtained from stool samples 
(of children under 5 years of age) are not signiﬁcantly different in the control and treatment groups. These results 
are consistent with the fact that the treatments had no effect on diarrhea, micronutrient malnutrition, or anemia, as 
these health problems are usually related to parasitic infestations. 


Changing handwashing behavior is a complex phenomenon involving personal habits that has multiple (eco- 
nomic, cultural, social, etc.) determinants.25 This paper focuses on a large-scale handwashing promotion inter- 
introduced an innovative mix of 
vention that 
communication strategies to induce handwashing with soap at critical points in times. The study examined 
the effect of two different district-level treatments—a community treatment and an additional school compo- 
nent— on several outcomes: exposure to the program, handwashing determinants, handwashing behavior, en- 
vironmental contamination, and child health. 
The community intervention that has been studied here proved to be effective in reaching the targeted audi- 
ence with its handwashing promotion message, and it signiﬁcantly increased the proportion of mothers and 
caregivers who reported receiving it. The treated community group reported receiving the message through 
at least one communication channel more than 15% more often than the control group did. This more compre- 
hensive treatment seems to have successfully transmitted the key messages related to handwashing with soap. 
Increased exposure to the campaign and educational sessions translated into observable learning about best 
handwashing practices. This improvement in knowledge led, in turn, to statistically signiﬁcant behavioral 
changes in key areas, such as an 8.4% increase in the availability of water and soap in the household, hand 
cleanliness, and observed and caregiver self-reported handwashing behavior before eating, feeding a child, 
and preparing food. In addition, observed handwashing with soap increased among the treated households 
by 61% before eating and by 69% before preparing food, as compared with the control groups. However, these 
behavioral changes did not translate into better child health. Overall, no impact was found in terms of the

prevalence of parasites or bacteria in stool and drinking water samples (respectively), which is consistent with 
the fact that there were no effects on the incidence of diarrhea, micronutrient malnutrition, or anemia. 
The results of this evaluation indicate that more intensive interventions that, in addition to mass media 
promotional methods, include more personalized treatments (in this case, community activities and changes in 
school curricula) are effective in reaching target audiences and increasing the knowledge of mothers and care- 
givers about the beneﬁts of handwashing with soap. Furthermore, there is evidence of behavioral change in re- 
gard to certain variables as measured by self-reported behaviors and structured observations. This is a step 
forward in comparison with the reported achievements of other mass media campaigns (e.g., the work of Babor 
et al. (2003) alcohol-abuse prevention campaigns; the work of Madajewicz et al. (2007) on arsenic in the water 
supply in Bangladesh; the review prepared by Banerjee and Duﬂo (2011) on vaccination campaigns in Zambia;26 
and the work of Campbell et al. (2001) and Summerbell et al. (2007) on obesity prevention campaigns27).

lets as a good way to purify drinking water). However, only 10% of the families actually use the tablets. In addition, Banerjee et al. (2010)

this case, lentils and metal plates for having completed their immunization).
