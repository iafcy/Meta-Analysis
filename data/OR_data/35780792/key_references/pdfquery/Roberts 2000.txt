ABSTRACT. Background. Diarrheal 
are 
common in children who attend child care, and prevent- 
ing transmission of disease in this setting depends on 
actions by child care staff. We set out to discover whether 
transmission of gastrointestinal infections in child care 
could be reduced by improved infection control proce- 
dures. 
Methods. We performed a cluster randomized, con- 
trolled trial of an infection control intervention con- 
ducted in child care centers for 1 city in Australia. The 
intervention was training of child care staff about trans- 
mission of infection and handwashing and focused on 
both staff and child behavior. Implementation of the 
intervention was recorded by an observer. Illness was 
measured by parent report in telephone interviews every 
2 weeks. 
Results. There were 311 child-years of surveillance 
for diarrheal episodes. The rate of episodes of diarrhea 
was 1.9 per child-year in intervention centers and 2.7 per 
child-year in control centers. Multivariable analysis 
showed that diarrheal episodes were significantly re- 
duced in intervention center children by 50%. However, 
the impact of the intervention was confined to children 
over 24 months of age. For those centers in which chil- 
dren’s compliance with handwashing was high, diarrheal 
episodes were reduced by 66%. 
Conclusions. This trial supports education about in- 
fection control, for staff and children in child care, as a 
means of reducing transmission of diarrhea. Reduction 
in episodes of diarrhea in children in child care was 
limited to children over 24 months of age. Pediatrics

Child care is a unique environment for transmis- 
sion of diarrhea and preventing transmission of dis- 
ease in this setting depends on actions by child care 
staff. Four studies have assessed the impact of infec- 
tion control training of staff on the occurrence of 
diarrhea in children. In the hallmark study by Black 
et al12 in 1979, diarrhea in child care centers was 
reduced by 50% when handwashing was improved. 
This and 2 subsequent studies were limited by an 
important potential bias, the caregivers who received 
training were also the source of information about 
child illness.12–14 Furthermore, these trials did not 
control for potential confounders, such as breastfeed- 
ing or having a sibling in child care. The only trial to 
address these issues reported only episodes of severe 
diarrhea, in young children under 24 months of age 
were reduced by training.15 They concluded that al- 
though the intervention improved the behavior of 
caregivers, it may have had a lesser impact on child- 
to-child transmission. We set out 
to establish 
whether infection control training could reduce epi- 
sodes of diarrhea in children of all ages. 

We performed a cluster randomized, controlled trial of an 
infection control intervention in child care centers in the Austra- 
lian Capital Territory between March and November 1996. The 
trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Australian 
National University. Centers eligible to participate in the trial 
were those licensed in the Australian Capital Territory at February 
1, 1996 to care for 50 or more children for .9 hours a day, 5 days 
a week. We invited directors of all eligible daycare centers to 
participate. One center was a pilot site to develop and test meth- 
ods for the trial and did not participate in the trial. We delivered 
information booklets about the trial for staff and parents at each 
center and recruited parents of children by letter delivered 
through the centers. Centers were randomized to the intervention 
group after the center directors agreed to participate in the trial, 
using a random number table generated using EpiInfo.16 
Children were eligible to participate if they were 3 years of age 
or younger at January 1, 1996, attended the child care center for at 
least 3 days per week, and had no underlying chronic illness that 
predisposed to infection. A target sample size of 314 child-years of 
observation was determined based on requiring 80% power to 
detect a 25% reduction in diarrhea from a background rate of 1.4 
infections per child-year, using a test of 5% significance level.17 We 
adjusted the sample size by a factor of 1.3 for clustering, this being 
appropriate for an intracluster correlation coefficient of .01 with 20 
clusters and 28 children in each cluster.18 –19 The required clustered 
sample was, therefore, 408 child-years of observation or 544 chil- 
dren observed for 9 months. 
Training for the intervention centers was performed by L.R. in 
March 1996. The training incorporated elements of good health 
training developed by Kendrick20 and a exercise of handwashing 
using GloGerm (Moab, UT).21 The lessons were of 3 hours’ dura- 





tion and were held in the evening in the centers. Staff members 
who were unable to attend training in their own center were 
invited to attend sessions in other centers or lessons during lunch 
periods. Those staff members who joined the center after the onset 
of the trial were trained in a 1-hour lesson during lunch periods. 
We reinforced training and communicated techniques and routine 
practices in fortnightly visits and newsletters for intervention 
centers. We delivered 9 newsletters that highlighted how staff had 
incorporated the hygiene methods into their daily routines. Staff 
in control centers undertook training and received newsletters at 
the end of the trial in November 1996. 
The recommended handwashing technique is outlined in the 
Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Guide- 
lines for preventing infectious diseases in child care.22 Only soap 
was recommended as a washing agent. The duration of a hand- 
wash of an approximate “count to 10” to wash and “count to 10” 
to rinse was emphasised. Child care staff members were asked to 
teach the handwashing method they had learned to the children in 
their care and to perform handwashes for infants. We developed 
techniques to encourage children to wash their hands well, such as 
the use of songs about handwashing in melodies of nursery 
rhymes. The recommended circumstances for handwashing for 
staff and children were on arrival at the center, after toileting, 
before eating, and after changing a diaper (staff and child). We 
recommended that toys were washed daily using dishwashers 
where possible. Staff members who changed diapers were dis- 
couraged from preparing food for children on the same day. 
The primary outcome measures were parent reports of symp- 
toms of illness in telephone interviews every 2 weeks. To improve 
the parents’ recall of illness, we issued calendars at the beginning 
and middle of the trial. The calendars included definitions of 
illness. The interviewers asked a standard set of questions about 
respiratory and diarrheal illness, doctor diagnosis of otitis media, 
medication given, health service use, and parent and child absen- 
teeism from work and child care. The definition of diarrhea was 2 
or more watery or unusually loose bowel motions in 24 hours. We 
defined a new episode of diarrhea as the occurrence of diarrhea 
after a period of 3 symptom-free days. Analysis of diarrheal 
episodes was also performed with a new episode of diarrhea 
defined as occurrence after a symptom-free period of 7 days. 
Parents also completed a questionnaire about risk factors that may 
modify infections as described in Table 1. 
The secondary outcome measure was implementation of the 
intervention. One observer recorded compliance with recom- 
mended practices for a period of 3 hours in the morning in each 
center every 6 weeks. The observer was not informed of the 
content of the training sessions or the intervention status of the 
centers. The staff members in the centers were aware the observer 
was watching hygiene practices but not which specific practices 
were being recorded. We graded compliance for each child care 
center, by 3 groups of children’s performance of recommended 
handwashing. 
We analyzed the data using Stata Statistical Software, Release 
5.0.23 We calculated incidence of diarrheal episodes per child-year 
for all children and then for children in 2 age groups: over 24 
months of age and 24 months of age or under. We chose this age

Kotch et al15 identified a reduction in illness only in children under 
24 months of age. We constructed Poisson regression models with 
robust confidence interval (CI) estimates adjusting standard errors 
for the impact of clustering by center.24 –26 Our modeling strategy 
followed recommendations by Kleinbaum.27 The goal of our 
model was to obtain a valid estimate of the exposure– disease 
relationship. We performed backwards stepwise analysis for sig- 
nificant interaction terms. We applied the multivariable model for 
all children and children in the 2 age groups. Further, we analyzed 
the results by grading compliance in intervention centers, main- 
taining analysis by intent-to-treat by comparing intervention 
grades with control centers. 

The recruitment rate for centers was 88% (23/26). 
After randomization, there were 11 intervention and 
12 control centers. Sixteen of the centers were com- 
mercially operated (8 intervention and 8 control cen- 
ters). There was no difference between the propor- 
tion of staff members with child care qualifications in 
intervention and control centers (59/125 and 58/110, 
respectively; x2 test, P value 5 .4). In all centers, 
children were separated by age into differing care 
rooms with a range of between 3 and 5 rooms per 
center. Staff to child ratios, regulated by the govern- 
ment, were 1 to 5 for care of infants and 1 to 12 for 
care of preschool children. 
Children were enrolled in the trial for 113 677 
days, representing 311 child-years (see Fig 1 in the 
companion to this article, page 000). One third of the 
children were 1, 2, or 3 years old, respectively (see 
Fig 2 in the companion to this article, page 000). The 
attrition rate during the trial was 22% (51/299 and 
17% intervention; 72/259 and 28% control). This co- 
incided with offers of young retirement from the 
principal employer in the city, the Commonwealth 
Government of Australia. 
The incidence of episodes of diarrhea per child- 
year was lower in intervention centers than in con- 
trol centers. However, this was attributable to a de- 
crease in infections in older children over 24 months, 
not in children 24 months of age or younger (Table 
2). There was no difference in incidence by interven- 
tion status in males compared with females, the strat- 
ified incidence rate ratio for males being .77 and for 
females .70. 
The final multivariable model adjusted for cluster- 
ing by center, confounding by 11 variables and 2 
significant interaction terms (being in the young age 
group and intervention status and having a sibling 
who attends child care and intervention status). The 
confounding variables in the final model are listed in 
Table 1. 
Using the fully adjusted model, there was a signif- 
icant reduction in diarrheal episodes of 50% in inter- 
vention center children across the full age range. 
However, when the 2 groups were examined sepa- 
rately, the significant reduction in illness was present 
only in children over 24 months of age (Table 3). The 
reduction in children over 24 months of age was seen 
in every month of the trial except July. The intraclus- 
ter correlation coefficient for diarrhea in intervention 
centers was .003 and in control centers .022. When 
the definition of an episode of diarrhea was altered

to allow for a 7-day symptom-free period between 
episodes, the results were similar (24 months of age 
or under: relative risk [RR]: .96, 95% CI: .75,1.23, P 5

diarrhea was lower in the intervention group but 
was not a statistically significant reduction (RR: .54; 
95% CI: .28,1.05; P 5 .07). 
We graded compliance for children washing their 
hands, corresponding to intervention centers with a 
score of low, moderate, and high compliance. Im- 
proved compliance with infection control procedures 
was associated with lower illness incidence but the 
effect was still confined to older children. With high 
compliance of child handwashing, diarrheal epi- 
sodes were reduced by two thirds (RR: .34; Table 4).

† Multivariable model by age group includes 1 interaction term,

This trial supports the importance of training staff 
about infection control techniques to reduce episodes 
of infectious diarrhea in children in child care. The 
impact for children over 24 months of age was sub- 
stantial with a 66% reduction in episodes of diarrhea 
when children’s compliance with handwashing was 
high. Children’s handwashing may not be responsi- 
ble alone for reducing illness; it may be a marker of 
general good performance of infection control tech- 
niques. 
Our work initially seems contradictory to that by 
Kotch et al15 where severe diarrhea episodes were 
reduced only in younger children under 24 months 
of age. They did not find a change in all episodes of 
diarrhea. Although we found no reduction in diar- 
rhea in the younger age group, we did not separately 
identify severe from all episodes of diarrhea. We, 
therefore, could not identify if there was a reduction 
in severe episodes. 
In older children in control centers, our rate of 2.1 
episodes per child-year were similar to those re- 
ported by Kotch et al15 of 2.8 per child year. Although 
they found no reduction in children over 24 months 
of age, we found significant and substantial reduc- 
tion. Unlike their work, our intervention did impact 
on children’s behavior, and presumably, child-to- 
child transmission as shown by observations of chil- 
dren’s handwashing. From ;24 months of age, chil- 
dren become 
independent with toileting and 
handwashing. It is not surprising that if the interven- 
tion impacted on child-to-child transmission, reduc- 
tions in illness would occur in this older age group. 
Another explanation for reduction of diarrhea in 
only children over 24 months of age may be inter- 
ruption of transmission of pathogen(s) that caused 
diarrhea in older, but not in younger, children. We 
were not able to collect fecal specimens for microbi- 
ologic tests and cannot comment on which patho- 
gens were reduced. 
Our work has some limitations but these do not 
invalidate our conclusions. We did not directly in- 
form parents of their center’s intervention status, but 
they may have recognized this from other sources 
and parent reporting of illness may have been biased 
by this knowledge. The recording of compliance with 
infection control practices could have been prone to 
bias from the observer or children may have changed 
their behavior when she was present. We argue that 
children were not likely to change their behavior to 
impress the observer and that their handwashing 
followed a routine that was not readily alterable. The 
dropout rate in the control group was higher than in 





the intervention group and this may have introduced 
a selection bias if related to occurrence of infection. 
This is unlikely as the out-migration occurred from 
children reducing their care attendance at a time of 
downturn in employment in the city. The families in 
this trial were predominantly affluent, Caucasian, 
with 2 parents in the home, and our findings may not 
be generalizable to all circumstances. Children from 
these affluent homes may be at lower risk of acquir- 
ing diarrhea than others. 
This study supports the need for training of child 
care staff about infection control methods. Our new 
evidence is the substantial reduction of episodes of 
diarrhea in children over 24 months of age, an effect 
we consider resulted from interruption of child-to- 
child transmission.
