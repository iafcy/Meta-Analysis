Abstract: Diarrhoeal disease in children under ﬁve in low income settings has been associated with 
multiple environmental exposure pathways, including complementary foods. Conducted from 
February to December 2018 in rural Malawi, this before and after trial with a control used diarrhoeal 
disease as a primary outcome, to measure the impact of a food hygiene intervention (food hygiene + 
handwashing) relative to a food hygiene and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) intervention 
(food hygiene + handwashing + faeces management + water management). The 31-week intervention 
was delivered by community-based coordinators through community events (n = 2), cluster group 
meetings (n = 17) and household visits (n = 14). Diarrhoeal disease was self-reported and measured 
through an end line survey, and daily diaries completed by caregivers. Diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences 
results show a 13-percentage point reduction in self-reported diarrhoea compared to the control group. 
There were also signiﬁcant increases in the presence of proxy measures in each of the treatment groups 
(e.g., the presence of soap). We conclude that food hygiene interventions (including hand washing 
with soap) can signiﬁcantly reduce diarrhoeal disease prevalence in children under ﬁve years in a 
low-income setting. Therefore, the promotion of food hygiene practices using a behaviour-centred 
approach should be embedded in nutrition and WASH policies and programming.

Diarrhoeal disease continues to be a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in low and middle 
income countries, with 62.2% of diarrhoeal disease deaths in children under ﬁve attributed to poor 
water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and the associated consumption of contaminated foods in 
household settings [1–3]. A range of recent studies have examined our current understanding and 
the eﬃcacy of control measures taken to reduce exposure to enteric pathogens, including attempts to 
introduce multiple barriers to exposure pathways: enclosed sanitation, household water treatment,

hand washing with soap, clean play spaces, domestic animal control and hygiene of complementary 
foods [4–18]. 
These multiple environmental pathways of transmission in low income countries make it diﬃcult 
to attribute disease to a speciﬁc intervention, leading to calls for interventions that target the reduction 
of faecal contamination across the domestic environment, and develop a more appropriate package 
of eﬀective WASH interventions [8,19–22]. Despite the clear need for reducing faecal-oral contact, 
less than 5% of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa have access to improved water, sanitation 
and hygiene as described by the Sustainable Development Goal indicators [23]. These complex and 
detrimental problems need a more integrated approach taking into consideration both widespread 
exposure to faecal contamination [21,24,25], and the social, technological and economic inﬂuences that 
promote participation in and the uptake of sustained behavioural changes related to WASH at the 
household level [8,26–30]. The use of over-simpliﬁed interventions that have historically ignored these 
complexities is one potential reason why progress has been slow. 
The Hygienic Family (Banja la Ukhondo) intervention was based on formative research that found 
that children under the age of two were being exposed to multiple sources of faecal contamination 
within their domestic environments, particularly through complementary feeding at shared family 
meals, household drinking water, and exposure to environmental faeces [31–33]. However, as previous 
studies addressing food hygiene in low income settings measured success based on behavioural change, 
structural changes or the microbiological quality of food and water [5,9,10], our study was designed to 
measure the relative impact of the hygiene of complementary foods on diarrhoeal disease as a primary 
outcome, and the impact of a food hygiene intervention (food hygiene + handwashing) relative to a 
food hygiene and WASH intervention (food hygiene + handwashing + faeces management + water 
management) [31]. 


As described previously [31], the study was a randomised before and after trial, with a control 
and two treatment arms, assessing the relative impact of the hygiene of complementary foods on the 
prevalence of diarrhoeal disease in children under ﬁve years old. For the programme, implemented 
from February–November 2018 in the rural District of Chikwawa in Southern Malawi, we recruited 
1000 households in total. The two treatment arms were designed based on formative research: (1) a food 
hygiene intervention only (n = 400), and (2) an integrated WASH and food hygiene intervention 
(n = 400) [31], with a control group in which no intervention took place (n = 200). Although diarrhoeal 
disease was the primary outcome, respiratory infections were also monitored as indicators of improved 
WASH and food hygiene practices. End line data were collected in December 2018. 

Malawi is divided into 28 Districts, which are subdivided into Traditional Authorities (TAs). 
Each TA contains villages, which are administered by chiefs and/or village heads. There are 12 Traditional 
Authorities (TAs) within Chikwawa district. This study was based in four diﬀerent TAs: one in 
Treatment 1, two in Treatment 2, and one in the control. Treatment 2 included two TAs as there 
were insuﬃcient eligible participants in the planned TA. Baseline data reported elsewhere showed 
homogeneity across all study groups in terms of household demographics, socio-economic status 
and hygiene related proxies [31]. All study sites were selected in collaboration with the District 
Coordinating Team (government intersectoral team) and had all been declared open defaecation free 
by the Government of Malawi. 
All recruited households had a functioning latrine and resided within 500 m of a functioning 
borehole, to ensure that there were no signiﬁcant variations in access to water or sanitation infrastructure. 
Eligible households had a child aged between 4 and 90 weeks at enrolment (March–April 2017) to ensure 


that children were not neonates and that all children were under 60 months old at the end of intervention 
period (November 2018). The age of children was veriﬁed through birth and/or immunisation records 
supplied by the caregiver. All children in the target age range from eligible households were recruited 
at baseline; however, only one child per household was recruited. Physical recruitment was conducted 
by trained research assistants with the approval and support of community health workers (Health 
Surveillance Assistants (HSAs), traditional leaders (village chiefs) and community coordinators (female 
community members employed by the study). Morse, et al. reported the sample size calculations for

Based on the ﬁndings of the formative and baseline data, and using a behaviour-centred approach, 
the 31-week intervention included four critical areas as outlined in Figure 1 and described elsewhere [31].

31-week programme. 

The intervention was designed in modules (n = 4) to be delivered through community coordinators 
with the support of government HSAs, and oversight from study coordinators, to determine if the 
content and approach were appropriate for scaling up within existing structures. The content was 
conveyed through community-level open days at the beginning and end of the trial (n = 2). Additional 
content was delivered through cluster meetings (up to 25 caregivers per group) (n = 17) and household 
visits (one-to-one meetings) (n = 14), which took place on alternating weeks. Cluster meetings included 
community coordinator-led discussions, practical exercises, demonstrations, games and celebrations of 

success to promote behavioural change and build supportive networks and social capital within the 
group [31]. Household visits allowed community coordinators to assess progress, helped to put lessons

into action, and provided support for any challenges that the households might have been facing. 
The number of cluster meetings and household visits varied depending on the material included in 
each topic. 
Both community coordinators and health workers were supported and supervised by treatment 
arm coordinators to ensure the integrity and ﬁdelity of the content delivered. Each module of the 
intervention was preceded by a one-week course of training for the community coordinators and HSAs. 
Completion of the module was also followed up with a review exercise to evaluate the successes and 
challenges encountered, and outline proposed changes in the content or delivery mechanisms. 






Primary health outcome—diarrhoeal disease, deﬁned by WHO as the passage of three or more 
loose or liquid stools per day [34]. 
Secondary health outcome—acute respiratory infections, deﬁned as children having a fever plus 
either a cough or nasal congestion, or a fever plus breathing diﬃculty [35]. 

Episodes of diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections were self-reported daily using household 
diaries. Diaries were checked for completeness during household visits (fortnightly) and 
collected monthly from February to December 2018 from caregivers by community coordinators. 
Diaries were collected from the ﬁeld and recorded in Microsoft Excel for analysis. 
Episodes of diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections were self-reported for the two-week period 
preceding baseline (March 2017) and end line (December 2018) surveys. These surveys were 
conducted by trained research assistants, and the responses were recorded on tablets using the 
Kobo Collect software [36], cleaned and prepared for analysis.

The primary variable of interest was the occurrence of diarrhoea within the past 2 weeks as 
reported by the primary caregiver, measured as a binary outcome. The impact of the interventions was 
analysed using a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences approach, i.e., the prevalence of diarrhoea in the treatment 
areas was measured between baseline and the follow-up surveys and compared to that at the same 
time points in the control areas (n = 1000). Attendance at cluster meetings (individual level), cluster 
attendance score (cluster level), socio-economic characteristics (individual level), and household 
hygiene improvements (e.g., installation of a dish rack) (individual level), were included as covariates 
in the model. The incidence of secondary outcomes of acute respiratory infection was likewise analysed. 
Daily diarrhoea and respiratory infection values (continuous data) were collected as a way of 
monitoring temporal changes that may have resulted due to other interventions, environmental 
changes, seasonality, or other unknown factors. 
In the treatment areas, the attendance of caregivers at cluster meetings was measured using a 
register maintained by the community coordinators and checked by the treatment arm coordinators. 
Household visits were measured through the submission of completed household checklists completed 
by the community coordinators at each household visit and checked by the treatment arm coordinators. 
All attendance and visit records were consolidated by the treatment arm coordinators and submitted 
as weekly reports. 




The study protocol was approved by the University of Malawi’s College of Medicine Research 
Ethics Committee. Permission was obtained from the local authorities, those are, the Chikwawa 
District Council, the Chikwawa District Health Oﬃce, and the traditional chiefs. The participants 
were advised that they had the freedom to refuse participation or withdraw from the study at any 
time. Participants’ written informed consent was obtained before inclusion in the study. Participants 
were provided with a unique identifying number, and data were anonymized during data analysis. 
Data were accessed only by the authors. The study was registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials 
Registry (PACTR201703002084166). 







The characteristics of participants for the study have been published elsewhere [31]. A total 
of 1000 children from separate households were recruited (Treatment 1 = 400, Treatment 2 = 400, 

Control = 200) as outlined in Figure 2. By end line, 18.7% of households had been lost to attrition, 
primarily due to relocation from the study area (Treatment 1 = 19.25%, Treatment 2 = 23.5%, Control = 8%) 
children from separate households were recruited (Treatment 1 = 400, Treatment 2 = 400, Control = 200) as

of diarrhoea and respiratory infections were similar at baseline between the treatment and control 
groups. Indicators for breastfeeding, the consumption of solid foods and drinking water, and the 
hygiene proxies for sanitation and hygiene in the home were also consistent across the control and 
treatment areas, with all households having a latrine [31].

Chi-square analysis was used to test whether there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the 
diﬀerences in the intervention and control groups at baseline and follow-up: [follow-up−baseline] 

intervention-[follow-up−baseline] control. When sanitation and hygiene proxy measures (i.e., the presence 

of soap in the household, the presence of a handwashing facility, the presence of a dish rack, the presence 
of soap and water at a handwashing facility and at a utensil washing location) were compared between 
baseline and follow-up surveys across all of the three study areas, there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences 
(p < 0.0001) both between the control and Treatment 1 (Table 1) and between the control and Treatment 
2 (Table 2). However, when baseline and follow up data were compared between Treatment 1 and 

Treatment 2 (Table 3), the diﬀerences were not signiﬁcant. Nevertheless, there were slightly more 

hygiene proxy measures measured in Treatment 1. For instance, 84% of the handwashing facilities in 
Treatment 1 had soap and water compared to 70% measured in Treatment 2.

As outlined in Table 4, the average attendance values at cluster meetings give an indication of 
the general participation rates. On average, these were at least 50% of the target number, though 
never close to 100%, indicating that there were consistent absences throughout the module delivery. 
Almost consistently, the average attendance was higher in Treatment 2 than in Treatment 1. The only 
systematic diﬀerence between these two groups was the treatment arm coordinator that delivered 
the intervention training and conducted supervisory visits to community coordinators during cluster 
meetings and household visits. We can therefore only assume that this unobserved factor played a 
role in the attendance of the caregivers. The percentage of the participants that attended no meetings 
(% none attended) or had no household visits indicate a monitoring gap on the part of the project 
implementors, and again, these values are consistently higher in Treatment 1. Similarly, the percentage 
of caregivers that attended all meetings or received all of the target household visits was higher in 
Treatment 2, reaching a maximum of 89% for the faeces management cluster meeting, and except for 
the visits pertaining to food safety and hygiene, the percentage that attended all household visits was 
consistently over 80%.

To determine the impact of the intervention, we collected self-reported illness (diarrhoea and 
respiratory infection) data two weeks prior to baseline or end line. As outlined in Figure 4, the 
percentages of children with diarrhoea were generally consistent, with no statistically signiﬁcant 
diﬀerences between the groups at baseline, and they were in line with national averages. Throughout 
the period of the study, children moved into higher age categories, and the control group’s reduction 
in illness reﬂects a natural decline in line with national averages; however, illness in the intervention 
groups was seen to decrease further. 
The results were further analysed using a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences analysis and are presented 
in Table 5. At baseline (before the intervention), there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the 
Treatment and Control values for any of the outcome variables (diarrhoea and respiratory infection). 
There were signiﬁcant diﬀerences between each Treatment area and the Control area at end line (after 
the intervention) for diarrhoea, but for respiratory infections, only between Treatment 2 and Control. 
The ﬁnal diﬀerence in diﬀerences results were strong and signiﬁcant for diarrhoea in both areas, and 
for respiratory infections in Treatment 2.

The impact on diarrhoea from the full set of interventions (four modules) in Treatment 2 was 
slightly higher (0.5%) than that from the two modules delivered in Treatment 1, though not suﬃciently 
so that the additional 9 weeks of implementation could be considered eﬃcient. However, the additional 
module delivery (faeces management and household water management) signiﬁcantly reduced the 
incidence of respiratory infections (by almost 13 percentage points). 
Individuals responsible for 
delivery and monitoring appear to have had a non-measurable eﬀect on the participants’ learning 
and retention. 
In order to better understand the other factors responsible for the measured outcome results, 
we constructed linear probability models for both of the binary outcome variables (diarrhoea and 
respiratory infection) at end line, including relevant explanatory variables. The results are shown in 
Table 6. Logistic regression estimations, shown as relative risk values, are also available in Appendix A.

For diarrhoea in both treatment arms, none of the explanatory variables were signiﬁcant in 
explaining the reported end line values; in other words, only the intervention, irrespective of any 
other household conditions or socio-demographic factors, was responsible for the prevalence observed 
(columns 1 and 3); even the numbers of visits or meetings that the caregivers engaged in were not 
responsible. On the other hand, the actual intervention (columns 2 and 4) was highly signiﬁcant in 
predicting the reduction of diarrhoea. This paradox points to other factors that aﬀected the behaviour 
observed, i.e., being in the treatment arm had an impact, but that impact was not dependent on the 
level of participation. However, the model ﬁt was poor, indicating a large amount of unobserved 
variation. Due to the multifaceted nature of the intervention, it could be argued that the reduction 
was therefore associated with the impact of a high number of marginal eﬀects from multiple sources 
rather that one overriding eﬀect from a single change in behaviour. It is also likely that the qualities 
and personal characteristics of the individuals implementing the interventions may have played an 

important role in explaining the results observed. 












The results for respiratory infections are similar in that both interventions had signiﬁcant impacts 
(columns 6 and 8), though unlike the results for diarrhoea, the reduction observed was signiﬁcantly 
aﬀected by both the baseline values for respiratory illness (columns 5–8) and the number of visits and 
meetings attended (columns 5 and 7). 



While the results shown in Table 5 convey the net changes in the outcome indicators between 
the baseline and end line surveys, the results presented in Figure 5 illustrate the monthly changes 
that were recorded continuously between those points. These continuous data were self-reported by 
the caregivers on a daily basis, which were checked by the community coordinators who visited the 
that were recorded continuously between those points. These continuous data were self-reported by 
household on a fortnightly basis and subsequently collected at the end of each month. Each household 
diary was speciﬁc to the target child in the study and recorded the number of episodes the child 
experienced for the outcome of interest. The results from the household daily diaries correlated with 
those of the self-reported incidences at baseline and end line. 

While the results shown in Table 5 convey the net changes in the outcome indicators between

household diary was specific to the target child in the study and recorded the number of episodes 
the child experienced for the outcome of interest. The results from the household daily diaries 



correlated with those of the self-reported incidences at baseline and end line. 
 


Figure 5. (a) Continuous diarrhoeal disease cases reported in terms of at least one per household (2018); 
(b) Continuous respiratory disease cases reported in terms of at least one per household (2018). 

Data are plotted for a child having at least one incident or infection during the month (Figure 5a,b). 
All health outcome graphs reﬂect a challenge with data from the control group occurring in the months 
of April and July (2018), reﬂective of missing diaries misplaced by the group coordinator. 


The results in Figure 5a highlight that although the number of children who had diarrhoea within 
a month were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the control and treatment areas, the number of cases 
per month was higher in the control area and remained high over the period of measurement, while 
the values in the treatment areas were eﬀectively null by the end of the period. 
Compared to diarrhoea, respiratory infection (Figure 5b) was much more common and aﬀected 
nearly one quarter of the Treatment 1 population in March, which may be attributed to the hot and 
rainy season, which sees a proliferation of febrile illness and additional time spent in enclosed spaces 
due to wet weather. A later peak in respiratory illnesses would be associated with winter months 
in May to August. National ﬁgures show an average of 5.4% of children under ﬁve having acute 
respiratory illness (ARI), peaking at over 6% between 6 and 35 months and then declining to around 
4.5%. Therefore, as with diarrhoeal disease, the decline seen across groups could be attributed to the 
increasing ages of the participants. However, as with diarrhoea, there was also a higher reduction 
in the number of reported cases of ARI in the treatment areas within a given month compared to 
in the control, inferring that improved hygiene practices may have led to an increased reduction in 
target households. 

This before and after trial with a control in rural Malawi measured the relative impact of a 
multi-faceted hygiene intervention on the reduction of diarrhoeal disease in an under ﬁve population. 
Self-reported results indicated a signiﬁcant reduction in diarrhoeal disease associated with improved 
hand washing with soap at critical times and food hygiene practices. Those households that also 
improved faeces and water management additionally showed a signiﬁcant reduction in acute respiratory 
infections. We did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant explanatory variables for the reduction in illness in the 
treatment arms, indicating that the gains were likely to be from marginal eﬀects across multiple sources 




 
 



 
 


rather than from one over-riding single behaviour. This ﬁnding is in line with the outcomes in the 
recent body of evidence from a range of WASH trials, which have highlighted the need to tackle 
multiple routes of pathogen exposure and take a new approach to how these are addressed [8,19]. 
Although there may be concerns related to self-reporting illness, our study relied on both daily diaries 
and two week recall at baseline and end line. The data sources show similar reductions in disease 
prevalence across the study period, thereby supporting our reported ﬁndings. 
Minimal relative reductions in diarrhoeal disease between Treatments 1 and 2 infer a signiﬁcant 
role played by food hygiene practices and associated hand washing with soap at critical times. The role 
of food in diarrhoeal disease transmission has been long recognised [37–41], and a recent WHO report 
attributed 70% of the burden of foodborne disease to low and middle income countries, with 40% 
of this burden aﬀecting children under the age of ﬁve [2]. Our ﬁndings support the growing body 
of evidence that improving food hygiene practices can play a signiﬁcant role in reducing diarrhoeal 
disease in under ﬁve populations. We also recognise the role that eﬀective hand washing with soap 
may be playing in this reported reduction in diarrhoea, and acknowledge that even increased hand 
washing with water alone may be contributing to these improved health outcomes [18,42–44]. 
Similar reductions in diarrhoeal disease between Treatments 1 and 2 may also have been aﬀected 
by the content of the WASH based modules: our study did not promote or subsidise point of use water 
treatment, which may have limited the impact of the water management improvements due to the 
continued post collection contamination of drinking water with E. coli. In addition, it may be indicative 
of the wide level of faecal contamination already present in the environment [13,14], which existed 
before the intervention supported the management of animal and child faeces from the household yard. 
In terms of reductions in respiratory infections, results infer the need for a wider approach to 
reducing environmental exposure to faecal matter. Our observed reduction associated with improved 
WASH practices is in agreement with previous reports of improved hygiene having a secondary impact 
on acute respiratory infections [35,45]. 
Our behaviour-centred intervention used the Risks, Attitudes, Norms, Abilities and Self Regulation 
(RANAS) approach, [46] and the embedded recommended behavioural change techniques [31], within 
existing community structures to provide both familiarity and innovation in how messages were 
delivered. Although the contact time was intensive, the mode of delivery used reﬂected that of existing 
community-based women’s and caregiver groups [47]. Our formative research outlined the challenges 
this approach may have regarding caregiver availability, given that the majority of households were 
subsistence farmers and, therefore, self-employed [31]. As such, the intervention content was designed 
in such a way as to provide repetition and ensure that missed cluster meetings or household visits 
would not impede long-term progress. The achievement of health outcome improvements in this 
study appears to show that this intensive and repetitive approach warrants further use, as attendance 
at neither cluster meetings nor household visits ever reached 100%. However, despite this, hygiene 
proxies and behaviours [48] were seen to signiﬁcantly improve in the treatment versus control arms. 
Any intervention must cognisant of the context in which it is set and the other household commitments 
of caregivers and targeted populations, which may impact their ability to participate in community or 
household meetings. Therefore, by using group and one-to-one household meetings to provide the 
same message through a range of behavioural change techniques and concurrently build trust and 
social capital [49], such an approach could have eﬀective implications for wider community hygiene 
improvements. This ﬁnding agrees with recent reviews which reported the beneﬁts of a high degree of 
contact time to achieve the anticipated behavioural change, particularly at the household level [8,30]. 
The use of community-based coordinators and community health workers (HSAs) was tested in 
this intervention to determine if the low education level of coordinators could be overcome with eﬀective 
training and supervision. Although we do acknowledge a degree of heterogeneity in the delivery 
and participation with the intervention content, the successful health outcomes of the intervention 
infer that the use of community-based coordinators, similar to that of care group coordinators (Scaling 
Up Nutrition) or maternal health women’s group coordinators [47] could be an eﬀective route for 


implementation. The use of local and familiar facilitators can ensure an ongoing empathy with 
caregivers, as they have a working knowledge and personal experience of caregiver capabilities, 
pressures and stressors, all of which can aﬀect a caregiver’s ability to make sustained structural and 
behavioural changes [50]. This is particularly important when considering the poorest populations 
and lowest levels of caregiver education in high risk populations in low income settings, where access 
to health care providers is limited, and exposure to faecal pathogens is high [1,51,52]. 
The modules developed through the Hygienic Family intervention have been designed in such a 
way as to support the integration of the content with other programmes, and to take into consideration 
the limitations of facilitators and irregular attendance from caregivers. There may be concerns that 
the integration of too many health and hygiene messages within speciﬁc caregiver groups could be 
overwhelming for both facilitators and participants. However, the call for an improved integration of 
services, as well as evidence from recent studies [53], demonstrates that such integration is an eﬀective 
route for improving hygiene practices in the lowest quintile of caregivers by education. 
The study limitations must be taken into consideration in the interpretation of these results. 
The intervention was limited to a nine-month period but likely would have been more eﬀective over a 
full twelve months. Despite this, the results reﬂect a range of seasons within Malawi, including the 
initiation of the rainy season (November 2018), which sees the peak prevalence of diarrhoeal disease in 
the under-ﬁve population. End line data were also collected soon after (December 2018) the completion 
of the intervention (November 2018), which may have led to reﬂexivity in the responses. As outlined 
above, we believe that we have compensated for this with the use of two methods for reporting illness. 
We also acknowledge that our study did not measure all variables that may aﬀect the prevalence of 
diarrhoea or respiratory infections, such as low birth weight status, malnutrition, HIV status, or the 
presence of other diseases such as measles, malaria, etc. 

We conclude that food safety and hygiene interventions with embedded hand washing with 
soap at critical times can have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the reduction of diarrhoeal disease in children 
under ﬁve years in low income settings. As such, the promotion of food hygiene practices using 
a behaviour-centred approach should be integrated into nutrition (e.g., Scaling Up Nutrition) and 
WASH (e.g., Community Led Total Sanitation) intervention policies and programming. Although 
limited beneﬁts were seen from the addition of faeces and water management interventions, it must 
be considered that these may have been impacted by the existing environmental contamination in 
the household yard. Integration can be achieved through existing structures using locally available 
expertise with appropriate support and supervision.
