A ‘non-blind’ randomized hand washing interven- 
tion study was conducted in a low socioeconomic 
community in Rangoon to determine if hand washing 
by 494 children under 5 years old and their mothers 
could reduce the incidence of diarrhoea and dysentery 
in 
the 
these children. Children and mothers in 
intervention group were asked to wash their hands 
after defaecation and before preparing or eating their 
3 main meals; 2 bars of plain soap were provided. The 
control group was left to follow customary practice. 
Diarrhoea and dysentery incidences in the 2 groups 
were monitored during 4 months by comparing the 
incidence density ratios (IDR). The diarrhoeal inci- 
dence among the children 
the hand washing 
households was significantly lower than that among 
those in the control households (IDR = 0.70, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) = O-54-0.92). For dysentery 
incidence, although 
there was a 40% reduction 
(IDR = O-58, 95% CI = 0.22-1-55) in the children 
under 2 years, there seemed to be no impact in older 
children 
(IDR = 1.2. 95% CI = 0.52-2-80). The 
study indicates that ‘hand washing is effec’tive in 
reducing the morbidity from diarrhoea and dysentery. 
Introduction 

to susceptible host involves many pathways, of which 
hands are one. Dirty, contaminated hands can act as 
mechanical carriers for the aetiologic agents to the 
susceptible host directly or indirectly 
through food 
and water or 
through household contamination 
(SAMADI et al., 1983.; AUNG MYO HAN et al., 1986). 
A number of stuQes have shown that proper hand 
washing with soap is effective in reducing acute 
diarrhoea and dvsenterv. These studies have been 
carried out either to determine the impact on dia- 
rrhoea alone in closed institutions where compliance 
can easily be monitored (BLACK et al., 1981) or to 
prevent the secondary transmission of dysentery 
within 

We are not aware of any study examining the 
impact of proper hand washing on both diarrhoea and 
dysentery in a community setting, taking care to 
monitor objectively the compliance of the interven- 
tion group. Very few people in Burma practise hand 
washing with soap and water after defaecation or 
before eating or handling food (AUNG MYO HAN 81 
THEIN MAUNG MYINT, 1986). Therefore, this study 
was conducted to determine if proper hand washing 
by children and their mothers with plain bar soap 
after defaecation and before preparing and eating 3 
main meals could reduce the incidence of acute 
diarrhoea and dysentery in the children. 
Materials and Methods 
Stuay population and admissiun 
November 1985 in a low socioeconomic grade com- 
munity (Nga-Kha ward of Thin-Gun-Kyun 
township) 
in Rangoon. During June 1985, household screening 
(for 
the study) was done in each 
contiguous electoral unit in the comrmmity, starting 
with electoral unit 1, until the required sample was 
obtained. 


The required sample size of 400 children was 
determined by using the sample size formula for the 
detection of difference between 2 proportions 
(ABRAMSON & PERITZ, 1983) and us& 
the mean 
diarrhoeal incidence rate of 0.2877 enisode/child/ 
month in the control group (DMRJICA, 1983) and 
O-2158 episode/childlmonth in the intervention group 
(tottted event rate after 25% reduction by mterven- 
Households selected were those which had one or 
more children between 6 and 59 months old, those in 
which the mothers gave their informed consent, those 
in which regular follow-up was possible and those in 
which the mothers and children were not allergic to 
soap. The mothers of children admitted to the study 
were informed of the mu-nose and procedures and 
informed consent and demographic data were 
obtained. 350 mothers and 494 children 
in 350 
households were selected for study. Of the children, 
only 12 (7 from intervention and 5 from control 
households) moved out of the community before the 
end of the study. 
Base-line surveillance and intewention 
After one month (July) of monitoring diarrhoea and 
dysentery incidence to obtain base-line data, the 
participating households were randomly allocated to 
intervention and control groups. The mothers and 
children in the intervention group were asked to wash 
their hands after defaecation and before preparing or 
eating their 3 main meals (early morning, 
late 
morning and evening). Two bars of weighed plain 
soap in 2 empty condensed milk tins were provided, 
one for use after defaecation and the other before food 
preparation or eating. The soap was replenished as 
necessary every 2 weeks during surprise random visits 
to monitor compliance. No hand washing interven- 
tion was given to the control group. 
Outcome assessment and compliance monitoring 
Daily surveillance (24 h recall) for diarrhoea and 
dysentery incidence was made from July to November 
1985 by 6 trained community health workers 
(CHWs). The reliability of their surveillance data was 
independently monitored each week by random 
unannounced visits, during which staff from the 
Department of Medical Research (who were unaware 
which households were receiving soap) monitored 
diarrhoea and dysentery occurrence during the pre- 
ceedine dav. The data sets collected bv these 2 
different observers were compared and their kappa

values and percentage agreement were calculated 
(FLEISS, 1981) and assessed. The median kappa 
values and the percentage agreement between these 
observers ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 and 97.7 to 98.5 
respectively. 
Compliance with the intervention procedure was 
maintained by daily checks and reminders on soap 
usage by the CHWs, by establishing close contacts 
with subjects and reinforcing the intervention proce- 
dure, and by checking the soap usage by weighing the 
distributed soap (with an electronic balance) during 
random visits. 
The operational definitions of acute diarrhoea and 
dysentery used were those described by NEWELL 
(1965) and WOODRUFF & BELL (1978) respectively. If 
7 or more days separated 2 attacks of diarrhoea or 
dysentery, they were considered as 2 separate epi- 
sodes. 
The base-line variables in the hand washing house- 
holds (HWH) and control households (CH) were 
compared using the differences between 2 means or 
proportions as appropriate. For the ordinal data, the 
median test was used. A large sample Z test for the 
incidence density differences (IDD) was used for the 
base-line diarrhoeal and dysentery incidence. Com- 
parison of outcome variables in the 2 groups was made 
by using the incidence density ratio (IDR) (KLEIN- 
BAUM et al., 1982). IDD and IDR were calculated on 


an HP41CV calculator using the program for com- 
parison of rates (incidence density data) of ABRAMSON 
& PERIT 
Results 
Comparability of hand washing and control households 
236 chiklren (162 households) were allocated to the 
intervention group and 258 (188) to the control group. 
The groups were comparable concerning almost all 
the important variables (Table 1). Although 
the 
base-line diarrhoea and dysentery incidences in the 
control group were slightly higher than those in the 
hand washing group, the IDDs were not statistically 
sign&ant 

Impact of hand washing on the incidence of diawhoea and 
dYSentety 
The impact of hand washing on the incidence of 
diarrhoea and dysentery among the children is given 
in Table 2. The diarrhoeal incidence for all children in 
the HWH was significantly lower than that for those 
in the CH (IDR = 0.70, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) = 0-54-0-92). Similarly, the incidences for the 2 
age groups (~2 and 32 years) in the HWH were 
significantly 
the CH 
than 
(IDR = 0.69,95% CI = O-48-1.01 and IDR = 0.67, 
95% CI = O-45-0*98 respectively). The correspond- 
ing percentage reductions in diarrhoeal incidence for 
the 04, <2 and ~2 years age groups were 30% 
(J44;*9), 31% (2.317.4) and 33% (l-313.8) respec-

on the incidence of diarrhoea and dysentery from the 
base-line to the end of follow-up. Hand washing 
intervention started at the begin&g of August, and 
from September the diarrhoeal incidence in the HWH 
lower than that in the CH through- 
was sign&antly 
out the intervention period. However, there was little 
difference in the dysentery incidence in the 2 groups. 
The risk of diarrhoeal pathogens spreading from 
cases or carriers to susceptible children within fami- 
lies or day-care centres is increased by poor hygienic 
practices (AUNG MYO HAN et al., 1986; BLACK et al., 
1977). To interrupt 
this transmission, proper hand 
washing with soap and water has been shown to be 
effective (BLACK et al., 1981; KHAN, 1982; TORUM, 
1982; STANTON & CLEMENS, 1987). Our study also 
found that hand washing intervention was effective in 
reducing the incidence of diarrhoea. The diarrhoeal 
incidence rates were significantly 
reduced in the 
HWH and the percentage reductions were within the 
range found in other studies (PEACHEM, 1984). 
However, although our data suggest that the 
intervention was also effective against dysentery 
incidence in children less than 2 years old, it seemed 
not to be so for older children. A number of reasons 
can be given for this. 
(i) Inadequate sample size may result in failure to 
obtain a statistically significant reduction. The sample 
size was based on diarrhoeal incidence rates only and 
not on dysentery incidence. We estimated the study 
the 
power 
observed dysentery incidence and found that with the 
number of children below 2 years in the study (171), 
and at an alpha level of O-05, the study had a power of 
only 54% to detect the difference. 


(ii) As our intervention focused on washing hands 
only after defaecation and before food handling or 
eating the 3 main meals of the day, snacks eaten

However, very little difference in the incidence of 
dysentery was seen between the HWH and CH in the 
O-4 years group (IDR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0-39-2-23) 
and 
(IDR = 1.2, 95% 
CI = O-52-2-80). Although there was a 40% reduc- 
tion in the incidence in the HWH < 2 years age group 
(IDR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0*22-1*55), the difference 
was not statistically signiScant.

between meals may not have been affected. Children 
older than 2 years who are ambulatory usually have 
more contact with contaminated enviromnent outside 
their houses and also more person-to-person contacts 
with other children during play. It is likely that our 
intervention was unable to prevent dysentery trans- 
mission during such contacts. 
However, the failure to find an impact was prob- 
in the conduct of the 
ably not due to inadequacy 
intervention, 
to the parallel occurrence of hand 
washing in the control group, or to major compliance 
failure because, if these effects were operating, we 
would not have found any reduction in diarrhoeal 
incidence. Our findings are corroborated by a similar 
study in another community in Kangoon (Ohn Kyi, 
unpublished data). 
Our study was not conducted ‘blind because it was 
difficult to maintain ‘double-blindness’ without more 
money and personnel. But we attempted to avoid bias 
by employing our permanent staff, who did not know 
which households were on intervention, to assess the 
outcome variables independently and compare their 
data with those of the CHWs. We found reasonably 
high kappa values and percentage agreement between 
these two categories of workers. Furthermore, 
another argument against bias was the lack of an 
intervention effect on dysentery rates in children 
older than 2 years. If bias in favour of intervention 
had operated, this would not have occurred. 
Poor compliance with the intervention might also 
affect the studv. However, this was subiectivelv and 
objectively assessed as minimal throughout the study. 
Bias could also occur from differential migration in 
the hand washing and control groups, but this was not 
so because onlv 3% and 2% from the HWH and CH, 
respectively, migrated during the study period. 
Hand washine intervention in Burmese homes is 
effective in redu&g diarrhoea and dysentery morbid- 
ity. But for a long lasting positive behaviour change to 
occur, sustained and culturally appropriate health 
education programmes need to be implemented 
(FEACHEM, 1984). Similarly, 
in parallel with these 
educational programmes, soap must be made cheaply 
and readily available.
