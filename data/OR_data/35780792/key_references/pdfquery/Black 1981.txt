Diarrhea has been recognized as a frequent health problem among children 
enrolled in day-care centers. Thus, we evaluated the effect of a handwashing 
program In two day-care centers (HWC) on the incidence of diarrhea among 
children when compared to children In two control centers (CC). After the 
program was begun, the Incidence of diarrhea at the HWC began to fall and 
after the second month of the study was consistently lower than that at the 
CC. The incidence of diarrhea in the HWC was approximately half that of the 
CC for the entire 35-week study period. Adenovlruses, rotavirus, Glardla lamblla, 
and enteropathogenic Eschehchla coll were found In the stools of a small 
number of ill children, but no pathogen was Identified In the stools of most 
children with diarrhea. These results suggest that a handwashing program 
will probably prevent at least some of the diarrhea in day-care centers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Epidemiologic investigation 
We studied four day-care centers in 
suburban Atlanta, Georgia. They were 
part of a national chain of centers and 
were comparable in building design; 
number of employees; sex, age, and race 
composition of children enrolled; total 
number of children; and number of chil- 
dren less than three years of age enrolled. 
They also had similar diapering and toilet 
facilities and sinks, bar soap, and paper 
towels for handwashing by children and 
employees. At each center, we studied two 
groups of non-toilet-trained children in 
separate rooms—infants six months to 
one and one-half years old and toddlers 
one and one-half to two and one-half years 
old. Two centers were randomly used as 
experimental centers (handwashing) and 
two as control centers. 
On June 7, 1976, we began monitoring 
diarrheal illness at the four centers. 
Day-care personnel recorded the daily at- 
tendance and occurrence of diarrhea for 
each child in the study groups. We denned 
diarrhea as a bowel movement that was 
judged by day-care personnel to be watery 
or more loose than usual for that child. 
However, we usually confirmed the pres- 
ence of diarrhea by examining feces in the 
diapers when specimens were processed. 
The presence or absence of diarrhea was 
recorded only for days of attendance; no 
attempt was made to identify diarrhea at 
home. We collected these records each 
week from the centers until completing 
the study on April 1, 1977. 
In a two-month baseline period (June— 
July), we observed that children and staff 
in all four centers infrequently washed 
hands and that the toilet-trained children 
were rarely supervised when using the 
toilet. Then the handwashing program 
was begun in two centers. Employees 
washed their hands before handling food 
and after arriving at the center, helping 
a child use the toilet, or using the toilet 
themselves. When children entered the 
center, used the toilet, were diapered, or 
prepared to eat, employees washed their 
hands using bar soap and paper towels. 
Children using the toilet were supervised 
by the staff to ensure that they did not 
place their hands in their mouths. These 
practices were rigorously monitored by 
the investigators and by the senior staff 
of the centers. The two control day-care 
centers were observed for diarrhea in the 
same manner as the experimental cen- 
ters, except that handwashing practices 
in the control centers were not changed. 
Informed consent was obtained from 
the parents of each child in the study. 
Positive laboratory results were reported 
to parents and to the children's physi- 
cians. Treatment with quinacrine or met- 
ronidazole was recommended for infec- 
tions with Giardia lamblia. 
The incidence of diarrhea was calcu- 
lated for each week from June 7, 1976, to 
April 1, 1977, by dividing the number of 
new (at least four days without recorded 
diarrhea after a previous episode) epi- 
sodes of diarrhea by the number of chil- 
dren present for at least two of five days 
in that week (child-week). By the con- 
clusion of the study, 116 children had 
been observed for 2242 child-weeks. 
Laboratory procedures 
In July 1976, we obtained baseline stool 
specimens from all children participating 
in the study and later from additional 
children as they were enrolled in the cen- 
ters. These specimens were examined for 
parasites and bacteria including en- 
terotoxigenic and invasive Escherichia 
coli. From July 1 until the end of the 
study, we collected a stool specimen from 
each child with diarrhea and, when possi- 
ble, from a well child present in the same 
room that day. Diarrhea and control 
specimens were examined for parasites, 
bacteria and certain viruses. 


Fecal specimens were obtained directly 
from soiled diapers and were either pro- 
cessed immediately or kept refrigerated 
until being processed on the same day. 
Two stool swabs were taken and placed in 
cold Cary-Blair transport media for 
bacterial analysis. The Cary-Blair speci- 
mens were held refrigerated until labora- 
tory processing within 24 hours. A small 
quantity of feces was placed into vials, 
one containing 5 per cent formalin and 
the other polyvinyl alcohol, for parasitic 
examination. A vial of stool was also fro- 
zen at -20 C for viral studies. 
The Cary-Blair specimens were exam- 
ined for Salmonella (9), Shigella (10), 
pathogenic Vibrios (11), Yersinia en- 
terocolitica (12) and enterotoxigenic, en- 
teropathogenic and invasive E. coli. Five 
lactose positive and two lactose negative 
colonies if present were selected from 
each specimen. The isolates were tested 
for heat-labile enterotoxin production by 
the Y-l adrenal cell assay (13), for heat- 
stable enterotoxin production by the in- 
fant mouse assay (14) and for invasive- 
ness by the Sereny test (15). Stools were 
examined by the fluorescent antibody 
technique of Thomason et al. (16) for the 
presence of enteropathogenic serogroups 
O26:K60, O55:K59, O86:K61, O111:K69, 
O125:K70, O126:K71, O127:K63 and 
O128:K67. Isolates from positive stools 
were serologically confirmed by the tube 
agglutination technique (9). 
Formalin-preserved stool specimens 
were examined for parasites with direct 
microscopic study and with formalin- 
ether concentrations after being treated 
with Dobell's iodine and normal saline. 
Polyvinyl alcohol-preserved stools were 
stained with Wheatley's trichrome and 
examined. 
For electron microscopic studies for vi- 
ruses, stool specimens were suspended in 
four volumes of phosphate-buffered saline 
pH 7.4, centrifuged at 1400 x g for 20 
minutes to remove large debris and exam- 
ined with the pseudoreplica technique 
(17). Efforts to cultivate and characterize 
viral particles seen with electron micros- 
copy have been reported (18). 
RESULTS 
Epidemiologic evaluation of the 
handwashing program 
During the eight-week baseline obser- 
vation period, the incidence of diarrhea at 
the handwashing centers (HWC) was 
higher than that at the control centers (CC) 
(table 1). After the handwashing program 
was begun in the ninth week of the study, 
the incidence of diarrhea at the HWC 
began to fall (figure 1). The incidence at 
the CC fluctuated more widely and was 
consistently higher than that of the HWC 
after the second month of the study. The 
two HWC were similar to each other in 
their incidence of diarrhea as were the 
two CC. The incidence of diarrhea in the 
CC was nearly twice that in the HWC for 
the entire 35-week study period (table 1). 
During the study period the incidence 
of diarrhea (table 1) among children six 
months to one and one-half years old at 
the HWC was significantly lower than 
that at the CC (x1 = 9.2, p < 0.001). The 
incidence among children one and one- 
half to two and one-half years old at the 
HWC was similarly lower, but not statis- 
tically different, than the incidence for 
comparable children at the CC. Although 
the incidences of diarrhea at the HWC 
and CC were apparently higher for the 
older of the two groups of study children, 
neither difference was statistically signif- 
icant. 
The incidences of diarrhea at the HWC 
and the CC were calculated by the length 
of attendance for children who enrolled 
after the study began. In the study period, 
newly enrolled children totaled 38 in 
HWC and 36 in CC and their first four 
weeks of attendance contributed 148 and 
143 child-weeks to the HWC and CC, re-

dence peaked within two to four weeks 
after the children started at the centers; 
however, during this period, and with 
minor exceptions thereafter, the diarrhea 
rates were lower at the HWC than those 
at the CC. 
Laboratory evaluation of diarrhea 
Baseline stool specimens were obtained 
from 47 (76 per cent) of 62 children en- 
rolled at the HWC and 54 (92 per cent) of 
59 children at the CC. G. lamblia cysts 
(in five stools) and Y. enterocolitica (in 
two stools) were the only pathogens iden- 
tified. The Y. enterocolitica strains were 
both Nilehn 1, Wauter 2 biotypes and were 
isolated from children at two different 
day-care centers. 
The laboratory findings on stools from 
children with diarrhea and from matched 
controls are shown in table 2. Since few 
pathogens were identified and the iden- 
tification rate for the HWC was compara- 
ble to that for the CC, results are listed 
together.

four children with diarrhea and one con-

No Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, Y. en- 
terocolitica or toxigenic or invasive E. coli 
organisms were isolated. Four ill children 
from one of the HWCs were infected with 
enteropathogenic E. coli serogroup 0:26, 
as was one well child at a CC. 
Using direct electron microscopy, we 
found rotavirus particles in the stools of 
four (5 per cent) of 79 children with 
diarrhea and in the stool of one (3 per 
cent) of 33 control children. The five posi- 
tive specimens were collected at a CC on 
two days in mid-January. Adenovirus 
particles were seen in seven (9 per cent) of 
79 stools from children with diarrhea and 
in the stool of one (3 per cent) of 33 well 
children. An adenovirus type 1 was iso- 
lated from the control specimen but, as 
reported earlier, virus could not be culti- 
vated from six of the specimens from chil- 
dren with diarrhea (18). The specimens 
from children with diarrhea were col- 
lected in two centers between September 
28 and October 14. 



For more than 100 years, handwashing 
has been known to help prevent nosoco- 
mial infections transmitted by hospital 
personnel (19, 20). Since enteric infec- 
tions in day-care centers are probably 
spread by the hands of children and 
employees, handwashing has been rec- 
ommended as a preventive measure (2, 3, 
5, 8). The potential usefulness of this 
technique is further suggested in the re- 
port of a study in school children from 
Cali, Colombia (21), which estimated that 
at least 44 per cent of the cases of 
diarrhea were related to school toilet 
hygiene. 
Full compliance with a handwashing 
program by personnel of a hospital or 
day-care center is difficult to ensure. 
Whereas in hospitals the risk of cross- 
infection is generally recognized, in day- 
care centers there is the added problem of 
general skepticism concerning the useful- 
ness of handwashing. Thus, we attempted 
to determine whether a rigorously super- 
vised program could make a detectable 
reduction in diarrheal incidence. Ad- 
mittedly, the frequent visits by the in- 
vestigators to monitor the program make 
it difficult to generalize the findings to 
a less-supervised setting. Furthermore, 
because there was no objective measure of 
compliance with the handwashing pro- 
gram in the four centers, handwashing 
was not documented to be responsible for 
the lower incidence of diarrhea in the two 
experimental centers, even though over a 
35-week period the incidence of diarrhea 
in these two centers was only 52 per cent 
of that in the control centers. 
Community-based studies of pediatric 
illnesses in the United States indicate 
that young children may have one or two 
episodes of diarrhea per year (22, 23). 
These studies also indicate that children 
who attend school are more likely to 
transmit diarrheal illnesses to their fami- 
lies than are children of the same age who 
do not attend school (22). Studies of 
illnesses in day-care centers suggest a 
higher than average incidence of diarrhea 
(4), and our observations in the two con- 
trol centers in this study indicate that the 
children in these groups had an average 
of four episodes of diarrhea per year. 
Although rotavirus, G. lamblia, and en- 
teropathogenic E. coli were all found in 
the stools of a small number of ill chil- 
dren, no pathogen was identified in the 
stools of most children with diarrhea. No 
enterotoxigenic or enteroinvasive E. coli 
were found in the stools of any children, 
which supports several other reports that 
these agents are rarely isolated from chil- 
dren with diarrhea in the United States 
(6, 7). 
Adenoviruses have been associated 
with diarrhea in several studies, although 
their role as enteric pathogens is still de- 
batable (7, 24-27). In recent investiga- 
tions, using electron microscopy (EM), 
adenovirus-like particles have been ob- 
served but viruses could not be recovered 
in tissue cultures (7, 25-27). Laboratory 
investigation of EM-positive stools from 
this study, as well as from patients with 
sporadic cases of diarrhea, indicates that 
these noncultivable viruses represent a 
distinct adenovirus subgroup (18). Their 
presence in stools of seven of 79 ill chil- 
dren, but not in those of matched control 
children, suggests that they may be in- 
volved in diarrhea affecting children in 
day-care centers. 
Most diarrhea among children in day- 
care centers is probably infectious, de- 
spite the fact that we identified a poten- 
tial pathogen during only one quarter of 
diarrhea episodes in this study. This con- 
clusion is supported by the lowered inci- 
dence of diarrhea associated with a 
handwashing program designed to reduce 
person-to-person transmission of enteric 
organisms. Furthermore, our observation 
that children enrolled in day-care centers 
are at higher risk of having diarrhea in 
the second to fourth weeks of attendance 


suggests that illness follows initial con- 
tact with other infected children. Thus, a 
handwashing program will probably pre- 
vent at least some of these enteric infec- 
tions.
