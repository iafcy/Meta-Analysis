School-based hygiene and water treatment programs increase student knowledge, improve hygiene, and 
decrease absenteeism, however health impact studies of these programs are lacking. We collected baseline information 
from students in 42 schools in Kenya. We then instituted a curriculum on safe water and hand hygiene and installed water 
stations in half (“intervention schools”). One year later, we implemented the intervention in remaining schools. Through 
biweekly student household visits and two annual surveys, we compared the effect of the intervention on hygiene 
practices and reported student illness. We saw improvement in proper handwashing techniques after the school program 
was introduced. We observed a decrease in the median percentage of students with acute respiratory illness among those 
exposed to the program; no decrease in acute diarrhea was seen. Students in this school program exhibited sustained 
improvement in hygiene knowledge and a decreased risk of respiratory infections after the intervention. 

Acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) and diarrheal diseases 
are the two most common causes of death among children 
< 5 years of age in developing countries.1 Handwashing with 
soap has been shown to reduce the risk of both diseases, and 
household water treatment reduces diarrhea risk.2,3 However, 
efforts to achieve widespread community penetration of both 
interventions have proven challenging.4–7 Attempts to increase 
use of handwashing with soap and household water treatment 
through integration with other services such as maternal and 
child health programs have shown some promise.8,9 Primary 
school programs aimed at preventing diarrhea by installing 
drinking water and handwashing stations in schools, teaching 
students about hygiene and water treatment, and instructing 
them to share these messages with their families have increased 
hygiene knowledge among students and changed practices of 
parents.10–12 However, although some studies of these school- 
based programs have found reduced absenteeism among stu- 
dents,13–17 limited data exist on the direct health impact of 
these programs. 
From 2007 to 2009, the Nyando Integrated Child Health 
and Education (NICHE) Project attempted to increase access 
to water treatment products (WaterGuard, PuR, and Aquatabs), 
soap, micronutrient 
supplements, and insecticide-treated 
bed nets in rural households in western Kenya through a 
combination of approaches: 1) social marketing; 2) installa- 
tion of drinking water and handwashing stations in schools, 
clinics, and churches; 3) health promotion by teachers, health 
workers, and religious leaders; and 4) local health education 
and product sales by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
self-help groups organized by the Safe Water and AIDS 
Project (SWAP), a Kenyan non-governmental organization 
(www.swapkenya.org).18 We evaluated the school-based hand- 
washing and water treatment component of the NICHE

Project to determine its impact on students’ knowledge of 
handwashing, hygiene, and water treatment practices in stu- 
dents’ homes, and students’ health. 

Setting/study population. This study took place in Nyando 
division, in Nyanza province, Kenya; Nyanza province has 
the highest rates of mortality among infants (95 deaths/ 
1,000 live births) and children < 5 years of age (149 deaths/ 
1,000 live births) in the country. In a recent survey, the 2-week 
period prevalence of diarrhea and ARIs was 16.2% and 7.9%, 
respectively, for children < 5 years of age.19 
Sampling/selection. This was a sub-study of the larger 
NICHE study, which was powered to detect a 10% change in 
anemia among children 6–35 months of age from 60% to 50% 
with a confidence level of 95%, a power of 80%, a design 
effect of 1.5, and a non-response rate of 20%. The sample size 
determined for this outcome was 729, 6–35-month-old chil- 
dren per study arm. For the school study, we used a conve- 
nience sample of school-age children in the households of the 
selected children. A separate sample size for school-age chil- 
dren was not calculated a priori. 
A two-stage cluster-sampling strategy was used to select 
60 villages from 17 sublocations (sub-counties) in Nyando 
Division (county).20 In the first stage of sampling, 30 interven- 
tion and 30 comparison villages were randomly selected, with 
probability of selection proportional to size, using the 1999 
Nyando Division census. Intervention and comparison villages 
were chosen from separate political jurisdictions (sublocations) 
to reduce the likelihood that interventions implemented in 
intervention villages would bleed into comparison villages. 
Villages in and near the urban centers (N = 38) and villages 
with pre-existing SWAP groups (N = 4) were excluded from 
selection. A census of the 60 villages was conducted, and from 
this, 25 children 6–35 months of age in each village were 
chosen. The student evaluation in the NICHE project was an 
observational evaluation in the context of the larger NICHE 
study; all students in grades 4–8 living in the households of the 
selected children was eligible for enrollment. The goal was to 
follow the selected students for the entire 2 years of this study. 


Schools in intervention villages were classified as intervention 
schools, and schools in comparison villages were classified as 
comparison schools. Community interventions occurred in 
intervention villages and targeted parents of young children, 
whereas separate interventions that targeted school children 
occurred in intervention schools. Not every village had a 
school, but the geographical separation of intervention and 
comparison villages reduced the likelihood of intervention 
students attending comparison schools, and vice versa. 
Baseline surveys. In March 2007, students in grades 4 
through 8 were interviewed about their water treatment knowl- 
edge and behaviors and asked to demonstrate their hand- 
washing technique. Correct handwashing procedure was defined 
as using soap, lathering all hand surfaces, and air drying. 
Students’ caregivers were also interviewed about house- 
hold demographic and socioeconomic characteristics; water 
handling, hygiene, and sanitation practices; and use of point- 
of-use water treatment products. Household water, hygiene, 
and sanitary infrastructure were observed. Stored water 
was tested for residual chlorine using the N, N-diethyl- 
phenylenediamine (DPD) method (La Motte, Chestertown, 
MD), and the caregiver handwashing technique was observed. 
Implementation: intervention group. Starting in April 2007, 
teachers in intervention schools were trained about hand- 
washing and water treatment and provided instructional 
materials for their students. In intervention schools, water 
stations were installed near latrines for handwashing and 
classrooms for drinking. The water stations consisted of 60-L 
plastic buckets with a lid and tap placed on a metal stand 
produced by local artisans (Figure 1), and schools were given 
a 3-month “starter” supply of soap and WaterGuard water 
treatment solution (a locally available product). Schools were

expected to provide their own commodities after exhausting 
free supplies. 
Active surveillance. Between June 2007 and February 2008, 
field workers made unscheduled biweekly home visits to 
enrolled households in both intervention and comparison 
communities to ask about use of water treatment products 
and episodes of any illness, diarrhea, or ARI among the 
selected students in the preceding 24 hours, and to test stored 
drinking water for residual chlorine. Participants were not 
informed of the chlorine status of their drinking water. We 
defined “any illness” as diarrhea, cough/difficulty breathing, 
rhinorrhea/coryza, or fever in the last 24 hours. We defined 
diarrhea as three or more loose stools in the 24 hours preced- 
ing the visit, and ARI as reported fever and cough or diffi- 
culty breathing in the preceding 24 hours. 
First follow-up survey. In March–April 2008, we interviewed 
students from the baseline cohort who were still in school and 
their caregivers, using questionnaires similar to baseline. 
Implementation: comparison group. In April 2008, the 
safe water and handwashing program was implemented in 
comparison schools using the approach described previously 
for intervention schools. Both intervention and compari- 
son schools received a free 3-month “starter” supply of soap 
and WaterGuard. 
Active surveillance. Between May 2008 and February 
2009 we resumed biweekly home visits to assess use of health 
products and illnesses over the preceding 24 hours as 
described previously. 
Second follow-up survey. In March–April 2009, we inter- 
viewed students from the baseline cohort who had remained 
in school and their caregivers, as described previously. 
Data management/analysis. All data were collected using 
personal digital assistant devices. Data were analyzed with 
SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Students and/or 
households who were unavailable during the cross-sectional 
survey but continued to be part of active surveillance were 
included in the final data analysis. Households of graduated 
students were excluded from active surveillance in Year 2. In 
Year 1, we compared children exposed to the intervention to 
unexposed children in comparison schools to measure the 
effect of the intervention. In Year 2, after both groups had 
been exposed to the intervention, we compared the two 
groups to see if the difference found in Year 1 between the 
two groups had diminished or disappeared. We calculated the 
percentage of positive responses for a given question among 
students and their caregivers and grouped them by school. 
Because the randomization was at the village level and the 
intervention was implemented at schools within villages, all 
analyses are presented for data summarized at the school 
level. Summary measures included percentages and medians; 
in this work, data presented as school-level aggregates are 
referred to as median percent, and 25th–75th interquartile 
ranges (IQR) are shown. Interval estimates of the difference 
in median school proportions, referred to as the estimated 
difference in medians (EDM), between comparison and inter- 
vention groups was calculated for each of the time points 
and represents an estimated effect size. The estimates are 
simple percentile bootstrap intervals based on independent 
sampling of the school percentages. Because of the small 
number of schools representing the two arms, we report 90% 
confidence intervals (CIs); differences between intervention 
and comparison arms are considered significant if the EDM 




90% CI does not cross zero. This nonparametric method 
and 90% confidence level were chosen after evaluating the 
data. Bootstrapping was restricted to schools with more than 
one student interview to reduce the influence of schools with 
small amounts of data in the bootstrap samples. For each 
year, active surveillance data were aggregated for each sur- 
veillance round at the school level, resulting in a water treat- 
ment and illness percentage for each school. Intervention 
school surveillance data were then compared with comparison 
school data using a similar method as described for the cross- 
sectional data. 
Ethics. The protocol was approved by institutional review 
boards at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (protocol 
1176) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) (protocol 5039). We obtained written informed con- 
sent from all participants. 

Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. At base- 
line, 783 students from grades 4 to 8 were enrolled from 
43 schools (range 1–48 students per school). In the first follow-up 
survey, 478 (61%) students of the original 783 participated 
from 42 schools (range 1–35 students per school), and in the 
second follow-up, 327 students (42%) from 41 schools (range 
1–23 students per school) participated; in the cross-sectional 
study, loss to follow-up occurred because of graduation, drop- 
ping out, or absence from school (Figure 2). Students lost to 
follow-up were not different from students who remained in 
the study with regards to age, gender, or socioeconomic status. 
One school that was enrolled in the intervention group had no 
students involved in the intervention; however, one child 
moved into the intervention school and was included in the 
analysis, accounting for the increase in schools from 21 to 22 
at the time of the first follow-up. Two small rural schools were 
excluded because of loss to follow-up of all their students. At 
baseline, the intervention group had a median of 42% (IQR 
38–57%) female students participating in the study; the com- 
parison group had a median of 43% (IQR 36–53%). 
We interviewed caregivers of 643 (82%) of 783 students at 
baseline, 422 (89%) of 478 caregivers at first follow-up, and 
300 (92%) of 327 caregivers at second follow-up. At baseline, 
caregivers’ median age was 37 years in the intervention group 
and 39 years in the comparison group. Nearly all caregivers 
were female. A median of 0% of households (aggregated by 
school at which the child was enrolled) in both groups had 
electricity and over 94% lived in homes with mud or dung 
walls (Table 1). At baseline, a similar median percentage of 
households in intervention and comparison communities used

improved water sources (40% versus 43%, respectively); this 
percentage increased in both groups at first (88% versus 93%) 
and second follow-up (both 100%), largely because of rain 
water harvesting caused by increased rainfall in the second 
year of the study. 
Students’ knowledge and practices. The median percent- 
ages of students (aggregated by schools) in intervention and 
comparison schools that reported washing their hands at 
school was higher in the intervention group at baseline (76% 
versus 56%, EDM 23%, 90% CI 3–39%), significantly higher 
in intervention than comparison schools at first follow-up 
(100% versus 40%, EDM 60%, 90% CI 53–73%), and 100% 
in both groups at second follow-up (EDM 0%, 90% CI 0– 
0%). The median percentage of students in intervention 
schools that could demonstrate proper handwashing tech- 
nique was similar to comparison schools at baseline (31% 
versus 32%, EDM 4%, 90% CI –11–19%), was significantly 
higher in intervention schools at first follow-up (46% versus 
14%, EDM 32%, 90% CI 10–46%), and was similar in both 
groups at second follow-up (54% versus 50%, EDM 0%, 90% 
CI −17–11%, Table 2). 
At baseline, the median percentage of students who were 
aware of WaterGuard was 100% in intervention and compar- 
ison schools. The median percentage of students in interven- 
tion and comparison schools who reported hearing about 
WaterGuard at school was higher in the intervention group 
at baseline (20% versus 13%, EDM 9%, 90% CI 1–14%), 
significantly higher in the intervention schools at first follow-up 
(63% versus 12%, EDM 53% 90% CI 44–61%), and similar 
between the two groups at second follow-up (87% versus 
82%, EDM −2%, 90% CI −2–11%, Table 2). During the first 
follow-up survey, a higher median percentage of students 
from intervention schools than comparison schools said that 
they told family (41% versus 13%, EDM 27%, 90% CI 7– 
36%) and friends/neighbors (31% versus 17%, EDM 14%, 
90% CI 7–25%) about WaterGuard; no differences were seen 
between the two groups at second follow-up (Table 2). 
The median percentage of students in intervention and 
comparison schools reporting that water at their school was 
treated with WaterGuard was similar at baseline (13% versus 
7%, EDM 7%, 90% CI −12–24%); significantly higher in 
students in intervention schools at first follow-up (100% ver- 
sus 14%, EDM 82%, 90% CI 75–86%); and similar in both 
groups at second follow-up (Table 2). 
Students’, caregivers’ knowledge and practices. Proper hand- 
washing among caregivers showed little differences between the 
intervention and comparison groups at any of the cross-sectional 
studies (Table 3). At baseline, a median of 100% of caregivers in 
both groups had heard of WaterGuard. The median percentage 
of caregivers who reported receiving teaching on WaterGuard 
from their child was higher in the intervention than the com- 
parison group at first follow-up (23% versus 8%, EDM 16%, 
90% CI 6–26%) but similar at second follow-up (41% versus 
50%, EDM −7%, 90% CI −17–13%). The median percentage 
of caregivers in intervention and comparison communities 
that reported treating their water currently with WaterGuard 
was similar at baseline (24% versus 27%, EDM 3%, 90% CI 
−8–15%), higher in intervention communities at first follow- 
up (50% versus 33%, EDM 22%, 90% CI 8–34%), and simi- 
lar in intervention and comparison communities at second 
follow-up (50% versus 50%, EDM 7%, 90% CI −5–25%). 
The median percentage of caregivers that had a bottle of 
WaterGuard present in the home was similar in intervention 
and comparison communities at baseline (29% versus 33%, 
EDM −9%, 90% CI −19–5%), higher in the intervention 
group at first follow-up (43% versus 34%, EDM 8%, 90% CI 
1–21%), and similar at second follow-up (67% versus 60%, 
EDM 7%, 90% CI −3–31% [Table 3]). 
Active surveillance data. During rounds 1 through 17 of 
surveillance (Year 1), a median of 43% of caregivers in inter- 
vention communities and 40% in comparison communities 
reported treating their water with WaterGuard (EDM 3%, 
90% CI −7–12%) within the preceding 36 hours. During 
rounds 18–36 (Year 2), a median of 58% of caregivers in 
intervention communities and 51% in comparison communi- 
ties reported treating their water in the preceding 36 hours 
(EDM 7%, 90% CI 2–15%, [Table 4]). The median percent- 
ages of households with detectable free chlorine residuals in 
stored water during surveillance rounds 1–17 was 10% in 
intervention communities and 11% in comparison communi- 
ties (EDM −1%, 90% CI −6–3%), and during rounds 18–36, 
was 9% in intervention and comparison communities (EDM 
0% 90% CI −5–4%, [Table 4]). 
During the first 17 rounds of surveillance, a lower median 
percentage of students in intervention schools than compari- 
son schools reported being ill with any illness (5% versus 7%, 
EDM −3%, 90% CI −4% to −1%) and having an ARI (2% 
versus 3%, EDM −2%, 90% CI −3% to −1%) in the preced- 
ing 24 hours (Table 5). During rounds 18 through 36 of 
surveillance, a similar median percentage of students in inter- 
vention and comparison schools reported being ill (3% versus 
2%, EDM 1%, 90% CI −1–1%) and having an ARI (0.8% 
versus 0.7%, EDM 0%, 90% CI −1–1%) in the preceding 
24 hours. There were no differences in the median percentages 
of students in intervention schools and comparison schools 
that reported diarrheal illness during either year of surveil- 
lance (Year 1: 0% versus 0.3%, EDM 0%, 90% CI 0–0%,

Findings of this longitudinal study suggest that the installa- 
tion of handwashing stations in schools and provision of 
hygiene training may have improved knowledge about proper 
handwashing techniques and reduced the risk of ARIs among 
students after they were exposed to the intervention. The 
decrease in burden of ARI found in this study was consistent 
with other studies on the health impact of handwashing,21 
though few studies have shown the impact of handwashing 
among children in international settings and most of these 
have focused on children < 5 years of age. This study provides 
additional evidence to support the global effort to expand 
hygiene interventions, including hardware, in schools.22–24 
Although knowledge of water treatment and access to safe 
water at school increased among intervention students in 
Year 1, we did not observe differences in diarrheal diseases 
between the two groups during this period. There are several 
potential explanations for this observation. First, diarrhea 
rates among the students were low (< 1%). Second, at base- 
line, a high percentage of students and their caregivers had 
heard of WaterGuard, which likely was the result of a social 
marketing program that began in 2003.25 Furthermore, similar 
percentages of caregivers in the intervention and comparison 
groups both reported and were confirmed to be treating their 
water during surveillance visits in both years of the study, a 
finding that was also likely influenced by exposure to social 
marketing and easy access to WaterGuard. Third, although 
only the water at intervention schools was reported to have 
been treated during the first year of the study, the students 
in both groups were exposed to multiple drinking water 
sources outside of school that may have resulted in a similar 
risk of diarrhea. 
Although the school program appeared to meet some of its 
objectives, as demonstrated by the higher percentage of 
intervention than comparison students that exhibited increased 
knowledge of water treatment and transmitted this informa- 
tion to their caregivers, it did not appear to lead to a change 
in caregivers’ practices. No differences between intervention 
and comparison groups were observed in reported household 
water treatment, presence of WaterGuard bottles in the 
home, or detectable chlorine residual in stored water. Other 
studies have also reported that, although transfer of informa- 
tion from students to caregivers has occurred, caregiver prac- 
tices can lag behind.15,26 In this case, the integration of other 
interventions at multiple levels of influence (individual; orga- 
nizations such as schools, clinics, and churches; mass media; 
and government) may have also had an impact on caregiver 
knowledge and behavior.18 Further research into determi- 
nants of behavior change could help elucidate reasons for 
the lack of effect in this and other studies as compared with 
studies that have shown an impact on caregiver water treat- 
ment behavior.12,13,27

Despite mixed results, the school intervention did appear to 
have a sustained impact. Over the course of the 2-year study, 
students in the intervention schools sustained improvements 
in knowledge (e.g., knew purpose of WaterGuard) and posi- 
tive changes in behavior (washed hands at school and 
maintained the ability to demonstrate proper handwashing 
skills). Additionally, although schools were only given a 
3-month free supply of WaterGuard, students at the interven- 
tion school reported that their school treated the water a year 
after the intervention. This held true during Year 2 among 
both groups. A similar instance of sustained implementation 
of a school-based intervention has been shown previously 
where a school-based safe water pilot was found to persist 
10 months after the end of the pilot.13 
This study had several important limitations. First, because 
the school program was implemented concurrently with a 
number of other village-level interventions and implementa- 
tion strategies in the NICHE project, particularly at the 
household level, it was not possible to determine whether 
results derived primarily from the school or the community 
intervention. However, the community interventions were 
meant to target adults, whereas the school intervention was 
targeted at students. Although no differences were found in 
mothers’ ability to demonstrate proper handwashing between 
the intervention and comparison groups throughout the study, 
we did observe a significant difference between intervention 
and comparison school students at Year 1, and comparison 
students “caught up” to intervention children at Year 2. 
These differences in knowledge among students in the two 
groups were paralleled by the differences in respiratory ill- 
ness. It is not unreasonable to infer that the installation of 
school handwashing stations and instruction in a learning 
environment may have led to these outcomes among students. 
Furthermore, the increase in knowledge observed in this 
study was similar to other school-based hygiene programs 
from the same region,13,15 and the impact on respiratory 
illness is biologically plausible. A second limitation is that 
illness outcomes were reported and not clinically confirmed 
raising the possibility of illness misclassification. Addition- 
ally, students were not asked about their illness directly, and 
if they failed to inform their caregivers of their illness, then 
illness episodes would not have been captured. It is likely 
that illness reported by children to caregivers would more 
likely be severe in nature; this potential reporting bias could 
have resulted in an underestimation of the impact of the 
intervention. Third, biweekly home visits could have resulted 
in respondent fatigue and lowered rates of reported illness. 
Fourth, repeated home visits with observations of household 
practices may have influenced the behavior of students and 
caregivers through the Hawthorne effect. Fifth, many students 
were lost to follow-up in this study through graduation and 
dropping out. Although students lost to follow-up were not 
different from the overall population surveyed at baseline, it 
would be difficult to impute the impact the lost children would 
have on the data. For this reason, we did not compare illness 
rates between the first and second years of the study. This 
study had a small sample size, which restricted our analysis 
to a 90% confidence limit rather than a 95% confidence 
limit as is the standard. Thus, the findings are limited when 
compared with other more robust studies. Finally, courtesy 
bias could have contributed to over-reporting of use of water 
treatment products and handwashing by participants. 
In conclusion, the installation of handwashing stations and 
hygiene education may have contributed to decreased rates of 
overall illness and ARIs in primary school students. Although 
we observed gains in knowledge among students about water 
treatment and increased access to safe drinking water in 
schools, these changes did not translate to reduced diarrhea 
rates, perhaps because of the influence of additional concur- 
rent water interventions in project communities. Despite the 
mixed findings, simple, inexpensive programs such as the one 
described in this work, along with curricular materials to 
enhance learning about water treatment, hygiene, and sanita- 
tion, merit expansion and further evaluation until universal 
coverage by piped, treated water and sanitary infrastructure 
in schools is achieved.
