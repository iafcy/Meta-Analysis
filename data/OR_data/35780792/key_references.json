            "abstract": "Despite the tremendous achievement in reducing child mortality and morbidity in the last two decades, diarrhoea is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children in many developing countries, including Ethiopia. Hand washing with soap promotion, water quality improvements and improvements in excreta disposal significantly reduces diarrhoeal diseases. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of hand washing with soap and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) educational Intervention on the incidence of under-five children diarrhoea. A community-based cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 24 clusters (sub-Kebelles) in Jigjiga district, Somali region, Eastern Ethiopia from February 1 to July 30, 2015. The trial compared incidence of diarrhoea among under-five children whose primary caretakers receive hand washing with soap and water, sanitation, hygiene educational messages with control households. Generalized estimating equation with a log link function Poisson distribution family was used to compute adjusted incidence rate ratio and the corresponding 95% confidence interval. The results of this study show that the longitudinal adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of diarrhoeal diseases comparing interventional and control households was 0.65 (95% CI 0.57, 0.73) suggesting an overall diarrhoeal diseases reduction of 35%. The results are similar to other trials of WASH educational interventions and hand washing with soap. In conclusion, hand washing with soap practice during critical times and WASH educational messages reduces childhood diarrhoea in the rural pastoralist area.\n",

            "abstract": "Started in 2007, the Sanitation Hygiene Education and Water Supply in Bangladesh (SHEWA-B) project aims to improve the hygiene, sanitation and water supply for 20 million people in Bangladesh, and thus reduce disease among this population. This paper assesses the effectiveness of SHEWA-B on changing behaviors and reducing diarrhea and respiratory illness among children < 5 years of age. We assessed behaviors at baseline in 2007 and after 6 months and 18 months by conducting structured observation of handwashing behavior in 500 intervention and 500 control households. In addition we conducted spot checks of water and sanitation facilities in 850 intervention and 850 control households. We also collected monthly data on diarrhea and respiratory illness from 500 intervention and 500 control households from October 2007 to September 2009. Participants washed their hands with soap < 3% of the time around food related events in both intervention and control households at baseline and after 18 months. Washing both hands with soap or ash after cleaning a child's anus increased from 22% to 36%, and no access to a latrine decreased from 10% to 6.8% from baseline to 18 months. The prevalence of diarrhea and respiratory illness, among children <5 years of age were similar in intervention and control communities throughout the study. This large scale sanitation, hygiene and water improvement programme resulted in improvements in a few of its targeted behaviors, but these modest behavior changes have not yet resulted in a measurable reduction in childhood diarrhea and respiratory illness.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nCommunity health clubs are multi-session village-level gatherings led by trained facilitators and designed to promote healthy behaviours mainly related to water, sanitation, and hygiene. They have been implemented in several African and Asian countries but have never been evaluated rigorously. We aimed to evaluate the effect of two versions of the community health club model on child health and nutrition outcomes.\n## METHODS\nWe did a cluster-randomised trial in Rusizi district, western Rwanda. We defined villages as clusters. We assessed villages for eligibility then randomly selected 150 for the study using a simple random sampling routine in Stata. We stratified villages by wealth index and by the proportion of children younger than 2 years with caregiver-reported diarrhoea within the past 7 days. We randomly allocated these villages to three study groups: no intervention (control; n=50), eight community health club sessions (Lite intervention; n=50), or 20 community health club sessions (Classic intervention; n=50). Households in these villages were enrolled in 2013 for a baseline survey, then re-enrolled in 2015 for an endline survey. The primary outcome was caregiver-reported diarrhoea within the previous 7 days in children younger than 5 years. Analysis was by intention to treat and per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01836731.\n## FINDINGS\nAt the baseline survey undertaken between May, 2013, and August, 2013, 8734 households with children younger than 5 years of age were enrolled. At the endline survey undertaken between Sept 21, 2015, and Dec 22, 2015, 7934 (91%) of the households were re-enrolled. Among children younger than 5 years, the prevalence of caregiver-reported diarrhoea in the previous 7 days was 514 (14%) of 3616 assigned the control, 453 (14%) of 3196 allocated the Lite intervention (prevalence ratio compared with control 0\u00b797, 95% CI 0\u00b781-1\u00b716; p=0\u00b774), and 495 (14%) of 3464 assigned the Classic intervention (prevalence ratio compared with control 0\u00b799, 0\u00b785-1\u00b715; p=0\u00b787).\n## INTERPRETATION\nCommunity health clubs, in this setting in western Rwanda, had no effect on caregiver-reported diarrhoea among children younger than 5 years. Our results question the value of implementing this intervention at scale for the aim of achieving health gains.\n## FUNDING\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n",

            "abstract": "A community-based intervention was developed through direct participation of the target population in assessment and iterative trials to improve hygiene practices and to reduce childhood diarrhoea in lowland rural Bangladesh. A total of 185 (98%) households with children ages 0-18 months in five contiguous villages were targeted for the interventions. A comparison site was selected for a detailed observational study and for use as a control for the intervention. About 97% of all households with children ages 0-18 months were enrolled for study at the control site. Children in this age group were targeted because at this developmental stage they were most vulnerable to diarrhoeal morbidity and malnutrition (related to unhygienic practices). The intervention was implemented with the assistance of village leaders through a \"Clean Life\" campaign by local project workers and volunteer mothers who were chosen from the target households. The intervention activities started in January 1986 and lasted for 7 months. Higher adoption rates of the intervention were associated with better cleanliness status, which was related to lower diarrhoea and malnutrition rates in the intervention site. The results of between-site longitudinal analyses showed that after the intervention, the intervention site had substantially higher cleanliness scores, lower diarrhoeal morbidity, and better growth status compared to those of the control site, with differences increasing over time. The findings suggest that this type of community-based intervention can be very beneficial in modifying hygiene behaviours and lowering childhood diarrhoea and malnutrition.\n",

Two intervention groups of DCCs families performed educational and hand hygiene measures, 1 with soap and water (soap and water group; n\u202f=\u202f274), another with hand sanitizer (hand sanitizer group [HSG]; n\u202f=\u202f339), and the control group (CG; n\u202f=\u202f298) followed usual handwashing procedures. We compared AGE episode rates with Poisson regression model.\n## RESULTS\nseven hundred fourteen AGE episodes were registered, significant differences between HSG and CG children were found during December and January. A multivariate model was applied and the adjusted incidence rate ratios by rotavirus vaccination found significant differences when children were previously vaccinated, the children in the soap and water group had a higher risk of AGE episodes (incidence rate ratio: 1.28, 95% confidence interval:1.0-1.64), compared with those in the HSG.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrated that hand hygiene programs that included hand sanitizer were most effective in the winter months. Further, the largest reduction of AGE episodes occurred in the children that followed hand hygiene programs including hand sanitizer and educational measures for DCC staff, parents, and children, and were vaccinated for rotavirus.\n",

            "abstract": "From October 1981 to September 1984, the authors conducted a three-year longitudinal study of diarrhea among infants and toddlers attending day care centers in Maricopa County, Arizona. In the third year of study, they evaluated the effects on diarrhea rates of staff training without external monitoring and of active surveillance conducted throughout the study. From 21 study day care centers, they randomly selected 10 (\"intervention day care centers\") to receive staff training in procedures to reduce transmission of infectious diarrhea. Continuing active surveillance in the 10 intervention and 11 control day care centers found no difference between diarrhea rates in intervention day care centers in the pre- and posttraining years and no difference between diarrhea rates in the two groups of centers either before or after the training intervention. Biweekly family-based surveys during the two months after training also demonstrated no difference between infant-toddler diarrhea rates in intervention and control day care centers. These surveys found the 21 study day care centers to have significantly higher diarrhea rates than did day care homes or households not using day care, but significantly lower rates than day care centers not included in the active surveillance. Continuous surveillance without training was associated with a significant decrease in diarrheal illness during the course of longitudinal study. One-time staff training without subsequent monitoring did not result in additional decreases and did not lower day care center diarrhea rates to the levels observed in day care homes and households not using day care.\n",

The incidence of diarrhea in the HWC was approximately half that of the CC for the entire 35-week study period. Adenoviruses, rotavirus, Giardia lamblia, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli were found in the stools of a small number of ill children, but not pathogen was identified in the stools of most children with diarrhea.

Few diarrhoea prevention programmes have been implemented in Bandundu Province, where available data suggest an annual prevalence rate of 10%. The urgent need to reduce diarrhoeal morbidity in Zaire, together with the potential effectiveness and feasibility of hygiene education as a diarrhoea prevention strategy, led to the development of the present research project.\n## METHODS\nA randomized, controlled trial of an education intervention to reduce diarrhoea through improved personal and domestic hygiene behaviours was conducted in 18 geographically separate village clusters (sites) in rural Zaire. For 12 weeks baseline information on the diarrhoeal morbidity of 2082 children aged 3-35 months was collected at weekly home visits, and structured observations of hygiene practices related to diarrhoea were made on a subset of 300 families. Intervention messages addressed disposal of animal faeces from the yard, handwashing after defecation and before meal preparation and eating, and disposal of children's faeces. Three months after the start of the intervention and exactly 1 year after the baseline studies, a second diarrhoeal morbidity study and a second observational study were conducted in order to evaluate the intervention.\n## RESULTS\nChildren in intervention communities experienced an 11% reduction in the risk of reporting diarrhoea during the peak diarrhoeal season, compared to controls (P < 0.025). The largest differences were seen among children aged 24-35 months, with those from intervention communities reporting significantly fewer episodes, shorter mean durations and hence fewer days of diarrhoea. There was some evidence that greater reductions in diarrhoea occurred in sites where the quality of the intervention, a scored measure of volunteer efficacy and community participation, was highest.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe results of this study suggest that hygiene education may be an effective approach to reduce the incidence and duration of diarrhoeal episodes in rural Zaire. Children aged 2 years appear to benefit the most. A Hawthorne effect of the education may contribute to diarrhoeal reductions.\n",

This is the first study to evaluate the impact of hand-washing on markers of subclinical, asymptomatic infections associated with childhood growth faltering.\n## METHODS\nWe recruited a total sample of infants in the target age-range (3-12 months) living in the eight largest Kathmandu slums, allocating them to intervention (n = 45) and control (n = 43) groups. In intervention areas, a small-scale community-based hand-washing program was implemented for six months; in control areas, mothers continued their normal practices. Time series linear regression was used to assess the impact of the intervention on levels of morbidity, mucosal damage, immune stimulation and growth.\n## RESULTS\nAs expected, children with higher levels of mucosal damage exhibited worse growth over the period of the intervention (P = 0.01, <0.001 and 0.03 for height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height z-scores, respectively). We observed a 41% reduction in diarrheal morbidity (P = 0.023) for the intervention group relative to control. However, the hand-washing intervention did not lower levels of mucosal damage or immune stimulation, nor slow growth faltering.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nReducing exposure to pathogens is an important global health priority. This study confirms the importance of hand-washing campaigns for reducing childhood morbidity. Yet our data suggest that promoting hand-washing is necessary but not sufficient to address chronic, subclinical infections. From a human biology standpoint, tackling the root causes of childhood infections is needed to address growth faltering in the context of highly contaminated slum environments.\n",

Previous studies lacked sufficient power to assess the impact of household handwashing on diarrhea in infants.\n## OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the effect of promoting household handwashing with soap among children at the highest risk of death from diarrhea.\n## DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nA cluster randomized controlled trial of 36 low-income neighborhoods in urban squatter settlements in Karachi, Pakistan. Field workers visited participating households at least weekly from April 15, 2002, to April 5, 2003. Eligible households located in the study area had at least 2 children younger than 15 years, at least 1 of whom was younger than 5 years.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nWeekly visits in 25 neighborhoods to promote handwashing with soap after defecation and before preparing food, eating, and feeding a child. Within intervention neighborhoods, 300 households (1523 children) received a regular supply of antibacterial soap and 300 households (1640 children) received plain soap. Eleven neighborhoods (306 households and 1528 children) comprised the control group.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nIncidence density of diarrhea among children, defined as the number of diarrheal episodes per 100 person-weeks of observation.\n## RESULTS\nChildren younger than 15 years living in households that received handwashing promotion and plain soap had a 53% lower incidence of diarrhea (95% confidence interval [CI], -65% to -41%) compared with children living in control neighborhoods. Infants living in households that received handwashing promotion and plain soap had 39% fewer days with diarrhea (95% CI, -61% to -16%) vs infants living in control neighborhoods. Severely malnourished children (weight for age z score, <-3.0) younger than 5 years living in households that received handwashing promotion and plain soap had 42% fewer days with diarrhea (95% CI, -69% to -16%) vs severely malnourished children in the control group. Similar reductions in diarrhea were observed among children living in households receiving antibacterial soap.\n## CONCLUSION\nIn a setting in which diarrhea is a leading cause of child death, improvement in handwashing in the household reduced the incidence of diarrhea among children at high risk of death from diarrhea.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nDiarrhoea and growth faltering in early childhood are associated with subsequent adverse outcomes. We aimed to assess whether water quality, sanitation, and handwashing interventions alone or combined with nutrition interventions reduced diarrhoea or growth faltering.\n## METHODS\nThe WASH Benefits Bangladesh cluster-randomised trial enrolled pregnant women from villages in rural Bangladesh and evaluated outcomes at 1-year and 2-years' follow-up. Pregnant women in geographically adjacent clusters were block-randomised to one of seven clusters: chlorinated drinking water (water); upgraded sanitation (sanitation); promotion of handwashing with soap (handwashing); combined water, sanitation, and handwashing; counselling on appropriate child nutrition plus lipid-based nutrient supplements (nutrition); combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition; and control (data collection only). Primary outcomes were caregiver-reported diarrhoea in the past 7 days among children who were in utero or younger than 3 years at enrolment and length-for-age Z score among children born to enrolled pregnant women. Masking was not possible for data collection, but analyses were masked. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCC01590095.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween May 31, 2012, and July 7, 2013, 5551 pregnant women in 720 clusters were randomly allocated to one of seven groups. 1382 women were assigned to the control group; 698 to water; 696 to sanitation; 688 to handwashing; 702 to water, sanitation, and handwashing; 699 to nutrition; and 686 to water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition. 331 (6%) women were lost to follow-up. Data on diarrhoea at year 1 or year 2 (combined) were available for 14\u2008425 children (7331 in year 1, 7094 in year 2) and data on length-for-age Z score in year 2 were available for 4584 children (92% of living children were measured at year 2). All interventions had high adherence. Compared with a prevalence of 5\u00b77% (200 of 3517 child weeks) in the control group, 7-day diarrhoea prevalence was lower among index children and children under 3 years at enrolment who received sanitation (61 [3\u00b75%] of 1760; prevalence ratio 0\u00b761, 95% CI 0\u00b746-0\u00b781), handwashing (62 [3\u00b75%] of 1795; 0\u00b760, 0\u00b745-0\u00b780), combined water, sanitation, and handwashing (74 [3\u00b79%] of 1902; 0\u00b769, 0\u00b753-0\u00b790), nutrition (62 [3\u00b75%] of 1766; 0\u00b764, 0\u00b749-0\u00b785), and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition (66 [3\u00b75%] of 1861; 0\u00b762, 0\u00b747-0\u00b781); diarrhoea prevalence was not significantly lower in children receiving water treatment (90 [4\u00b79%] of 1824; 0\u00b789, 0\u00b770-1\u00b713). Compared with control (mean length-for-age Z score -1\u00b779), children were taller by year 2 in the nutrition group (mean difference 0\u00b725 [95% CI 0\u00b715-0\u00b736]) and in the combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition group (0\u00b713 [0\u00b702-0\u00b724]). The individual water, sanitation, and handwashing groups, and combined water, sanitation, and handwashing group had no effect on linear growth.\n## INTERPRETATION\nNutrient supplementation and counselling modestly improved linear growth, but there was no benefit to the integration of water, sanitation, and handwashing with nutrition. Adherence was high in all groups and diarrhoea prevalence was reduced in all intervention groups except water treatment. Combined water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions provided no additive benefit over single interventions.\n## FUNDING\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nAlthough there is mounting evidence demonstrating beneficial effects of community health workers (CHWs), few studies have examined the impact of CHW programs focused on preventing infectious diseases in children through behavior changes. We assessed the preventive effects of community health volunteers (CHVs), who receive no financial incentive, on child diarrhea and fever prevalence in Ghana.\n## METHODS AND FINDINGS\nWe conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in 40 communities in the Volta Region, Ghana. Twenty communities were randomly allocated to the intervention arm, and 20 to the control arm, using a computer-generated block randomization list. In the intervention arm, CHVs were deployed in their own community with the key task of conducting home visits for health education and community mobilization. The primary outcomes of the trial were diarrhea and fever prevalence at 6 and 12 months among under-5 children based on caregivers' recall. Secondary outcomes included oral rehydration treatment and rapid diagnostic testing for malaria among under-5 children, and family planning practices of caregivers. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with a log link and exchangeable correlation matrix were used to determine the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for diarrhea, fever, and secondary outcomes adjusted for clustering and stratification. Between April 18 and May 4, 2015, 1,956 children were recruited and followed up until September 20, 2016. At 6 and 12 months post-randomization, 1,660 (85%) and 1,609 (82%) participants, respectively, had outcomes assessed. CHVs' home visits had no statistically significant effect on diarrhea or fever prevalence at either time point. After a follow-up of 12 months, the prevalence of diarrhea and fever was 7.0% (55/784) and 18.4% (144/784), respectively, in the control communities and 4.5% (37/825) and 14.7% (121/825), respectively, in the intervention communities (12-month RR adjusted for clustering and stratification: diarrhea, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37-1.45, p = 0.37; fever, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51-1.14, p = 0.20). However, the following were observed: improved hand hygiene practices, increased utilization of insecticide-treated bed nets, and greater participation in community outreach programs (p-values < 0.05) in the intervention group. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, the prevalence of diarrhea and fever at 6 months was 3.2% (2/62) and 17.7% (11/62), respectively, in the intervention communities with \u226570% coverage and a \u226530-minute visit duration, and 14.4% (116/806) and 30.2% (243/806) in the control communities (RR adjusted for clustering, stratification, baseline prevalence, and covariates: diarrhea, RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.60, p = 0.003; fever, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.92, p = 0.01). The main limitations were the following: We were unable to investigate the longer-term effects of CHVs; the trial may have been underpowered to detect small to moderate effects due to the large decline in diarrheal and fever prevalence in both the intervention and control group; and caregivers' practices were based on self-report, and the possibility of caregivers providing socially desirable responses cannot be excluded.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWe found no effect of CHVs' home visits on the prevalence of child diarrhea or fever. However, CHV programs with high community coverage and regular household contacts of effective duration may reduce childhood infectious disease prevalence.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nInternational Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Registry, ISRCTN49236178.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThe Gambia has high rates of under-5 mortality from diarrhoea and pneumonia, peaking during complementary-feeding age. Community-based interventions may reduce complementary-food contamination and disease rates.\n## METHODS AND FINDINGS\nA public health intervention using critical control points and motivational drivers, delivered February-April 2015 in The Gambia, was evaluated in a cluster randomised controlled trial at 6- and 32-month follow-up in September-October 2015 and October-December 2017, respectively. After consent for trial participation and baseline data were collected, 30 villages (clusters) were randomly assigned to intervention or control, stratified by population size and geography. The intervention included a community-wide campaign on days 1, 2, 17, and 25, a reminder visit at 5 months, plus informal community-volunteer home visits. It promoted 5 key complementary-food and 1 key drinking-water safety and hygiene behaviours through performing arts, public meetings, and certifications delivered by a team from local health and village structures to all villagers who attended the activities, to which mothers of 6- to 24-month-old children were specifically invited. Control villages received a 1-day campaign on domestic-garden water use. The background characteristics of mother and clusters (villages) were balanced between the trial arms. Outcomes were measured at 6 and 32 months in a random sample of 21-26 mothers per cluster. There were no intervention or research team visits to villages between 6 and 32 months. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of the number of times key complementary-food behaviours were observed as a proportion of the number of opportunities to perform the behaviours during the observation period at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the rate of each recommended behaviour; microbiological growth from complementary food and drinking water (6 months only); and reported acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea, and diarrhoea hospitalisation. Analysis was by intention-to-treat analysis adjusted by clustering. (Registration: PACTR201410000859336). We found that 394/571 (69%) of mothers with complementary-feeding children in the intervention villages were actively involved in the campaign. No villages withdrew, and there were no changes in the implementation of the intervention. The intervention improved behaviour adoption significantly. For the primary outcome, the rate was 662/4,351(incidence rate [IR] = 0.15) in control villages versus 2,861/4,378 (IR = 0.65) in intervention villages (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 4.44, 95% CI 3.62-5.44, p < 0.001), and at 32 months the aIRR was 1.17 (95% CI 1.07-1.29, p = 0.001). Secondary health outcomes also improved with the intervention: (1) mother-reported diarrhoea at 6 months, with adjusted relative risk (aRR) = 0.39 (95% CI 0.32-0.48, p < 0.001), and at 32 months, with aRR = 0.68 (95% CI 0.48-0.96, p = 0.027); (2) mother-reported diarrhoea hospitalisation at 6 months, with aRR = 0.35 (95% CI 0.19-0.66, p = 0.001), and at 32 months, with aRR = 0.38 (95% CI 0.18-0.80, p = 0.011); and (3) mother-reported acute respiratory tract infections at 6 months, with aRR = 0.67 (95% CI 0.53-0.86, p = 0.001), though at 32 months improvement was not significant (p = 0.200). No adverse events were reported. The main limitations were that only medium to small rural villages were involved. Obtaining laboratory cultures from food at 32 months was not possible, and no stool microorganisms were investigated.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nWe found that low-cost and culturally embedded behaviour change interventions were acceptable to communities and led to short- and long-term improvements in complementary-food safety and hygiene practices, and reported diarrhoea and acute respiratory tract infections.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nThe trial was registered on the 17th October 2014 with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry in South Africa with number (PACTR201410000859336) and 32-month follow-up as an amendment to the trial.\n",

Data on diarrhoea at year 1 or year 2 were available for 6494 children and data on length-for-age Z score in year 2 were available for 6583 children (86% of living children were measured at year 2). Adherence indicators for sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition were more than 70% at year 1, handwashing fell to less than 25% at year 2, and for water was less than 45% at year 1 and less than 25% at year 2; combined groups were comparable to single groups.

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nDiarrheal infections are common in children who attend child care, and preventing transmission of disease in this setting depends on actions by child care staff. We set out to discover whether transmission of gastrointestinal infections in child care could be reduced by improved infection control procedures.\n## METHODS\nWe performed a cluster randomized, controlled trial of an infection control intervention conducted in child care centers for 1 city in Australia. The intervention was training of child care staff about transmission of infection and handwashing and focused on both staff and child behavior. Implementation of the intervention was recorded by an observer. Illness was measured by parent report in telephone interviews every 2 weeks.\n## RESULTS\nThere were 311 child-years of surveillance for diarrheal episodes. The rate of episodes of diarrhea was 1.9 per child-year in intervention centers and 2.7 per child-year in control centers. Multivariable analysis showed that diarrheal episodes were significantly reduced in intervention center children by 50%. However, the impact of the intervention was confined to children over 24 months of age. For those centers in which children's compliance with handwashing was high, diarrheal episodes were reduced by 66%.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis trial supports education about infection control, for staff and children in child care, as a means of reducing transmission of diarrhea. Reduction in episodes of diarrhea in children in child care was limited to children over 24 months of age.\n",

            "abstract": "Hand washing with soap and water can prevent the spread of diarrhoeal diseases in areas where comparatively costly interventions, such as supply of safe water and improved sanitation, are not possible. In this study, the practice of hand washing with soap and water was instituted in a periurban slum of Dhaka city, and the surveillance for diarrhoea sustained for a one-year period. Rates of primary and secondary attacks were compared to those of a non-intervention area similar in age structure, economic status, education, and other relevant variables. Rectal swabs of cases and contacts established aetiologies. There was a large (2.6 fold) reduction in diarrhoeal episodes in the intervention area during the observation period. Rates of bacterial pathogens were also lower in the intervention area. Significant reduction in diarrhoeal incidences was observed in all age groups for all pathogens except for rotavirus. These observations if implemented as health policy could reduce the spread of diarrhoeal diseases at low cost in high risk areas.\n",

            "abstract": "Diarrheal diseases pose a major threat to the health of people living in developing countries, particularly where there is poverty and a poor environment. The effect of handwashing in reducing the incidence of diarrhea in day-care centers has been reported recently. The present study is a prospective community based study conducted to evaluate the effect of handwashing on the incidence of diarrheal disease in Calcutta slums. Handwashing was implemented in 1 slum and the other nearby slum, without handwashing program, served as control. The incidence of watery diarrhea during the 13 month period, between the study and control groups was not significantly different. However, the incidence of dysentery in individuals above 5 years of age in the control group was significantly higher as compared to those in the study group (p 0.05). The results of this study indicate that handwashing with soap may reduce the incidence of dysenteric cases in the community by interruption of transmission of the pathogens from 1 person to the other.\n",

            "abstract": "An educational intervention was designed to improve three water-sanitation behaviors empirically shown to be associated with high rates of childhood diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh: lack of handwashing before preparing food, open defecation by children in the family compound, and inattention to proper disposal of garbage and feces, increasing the opportunity for young children to place waste products in their mouth. Fifty-one communities, each comprising 38 families, were randomized either to receive (n = 25) or not to receive (n = 26) the intervention. During the six months after the intervention, the rate of diarrhea (per 100 person-weeks) in children under six years of age was 4.3 in the intervention communities and 5.8 in the control communities (26% protective efficacy; p less than 0.0001). A corresponding improvement in handwashing practices before preparing food was noted, although no improvement was observed for defecation and waste disposal practices. These data suggest that educational interventions for water-sanitation practices can have an important beneficial effect upon childhood diarrhea in developing countries, particularly when the interventions are designed in a simple way to promote naturally occurring salutory behaviors that are empirically associated with lower rates of childhood diarrhea.\n",

Data were collected on student absenteeism and reasons for illness. School nurses collected nasal swabs from students with ILI, which were tested by using a qualitative diagnostic test for influenza A and B. Compared with results for the control group, in the intervention group, overall absences caused by ILI, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and laboratory-confirmed influenza were reduced by 40%, 30%, 67%, and 50%, respectively (p<0.0001 for each illness). An intensive hand hygiene campaign was effective in reducing absenteeism caused by these illnesses.\n",

Safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) can limit the events. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of WASH education of mothers or caregivers on child diarrhea. A community-based randomized control trial was conducted in the selected households of a rural community in Dumki Upazila, Patuakhali from March\u2013June 2019. A total of 202 mothers/caregivers received intervention and 202 did not receive intervention. A pre-structured questionnaire was used to gather information on household WASH activities and diarrheal cases. Baseline data were collected first from the intervention group before providing education. WASH messages were given to the intervention group by face-to-face discussion. Both groups were followed up for diarrheal episodes for 3 months. Diarrheal prevalence of intervening group is compared with that of baseline and control. The results revealed that diarrheal prevalence was 11.4% (95% CI: 7.4\u201316.59%), 4.0% (95% CI: 1.7\u20137.65%), and 14.9% (95% CI: 10.25\u201320.52%) in baseline, intervention, and control group, respectively. Also, diarrhea was found lower in the intervention group than baseline (Z = \u2212 2.524; P value = 0.012) and control (Z = \u2212 1.85; P value = 0.04). WASH interventions were found effective to reduce the diarrheal episodes among under five children in rural community. Further investigation is necessary to assess the long-term effect of such intervention in other similar settings.",

            "abstract": "The association between hygiene, sanitation, and health is well documented, yet thousands of children die each year from exposure to contaminated fecal matter. At the same time, evidence on the effectiveness of at-scale behavior change interventions to improve sanitation and hygiene practices is limited. This paper presents the results of two large-scale, government-led handwashing and sanitation promotion campaigns in rural Tanzania. For the campaign, 181 wards were randomly assigned to receive sanitation promotion, handwashing promotion, both interventions together, or neither. One year after the end of the program, sanitation wards increased latrine construction rates from 38.6 to 51 percent and reduced regular open defecation from 23.1 to 11.1 percent. Households in handwashing wards show marginal improvements in handwashing behavior related to food preparation, but not at other critical junctures. Limited interaction is observed between handwashing and sanitation on intermediate outcomes: wards that received both handwashing and sanitation promotion are less likely to have feces visible around their latrine and more likely to have a handwashing station close to their latrine facility relative to individual treatment groups. Final health effects on child health measured through diarrhea, anemia, stunting, and wasting are absent in the single-intervention groups. The combined-treatment group produces statistically detectable, but biologically insignificant and inconsistent, health impacts. The results highlight the importance of focusing on intermediate outcomes of take-up and behavior change as a critical first step in large-scale programs before realizing the changes in health that sanitation and hygiene interventions aim to deliver.",

Yet rates of handwashing remain very low throughout the world. Handwashing with soap campaigns are de rigueur in developing countries, but little is known about their effectiveness. Few have been rigorously evaluated, and none on a large-scale. This paper evaluates a large-scale handwashing campaign in three provinces of Vietnam in 2010. Exposure to the campaign resulted in a slight increase in the availability of handwashing materials in the household, and caregivers in the treatment group were more likely to report washing hands at some of the times emphasized by the campaign. However, observed handwashing with soap at these times is low, and there isn\u2019t any difference between the treatment and control groups. As a result, no impact on health or productivity is found. These results suggest that even under seemingly optimal conditions, where knowledge and access to soap and water are not main constraints, behavior change campaigns that take place on a large scale face tradeoffs in terms of intensity and effectiveness.",
